2,a very big disappointment,"I have read the other 3 books by Cherry Adair on the Wright brothers and I have enjoyed them all. The plots were interesting and the romance and [physical]scenes were great. However this new book is way below expectations. The [physical] scenes (where in my opinion Ms Adair's strengh lies,) were very poorly written, there was absolutely no sizzle, and the plot was so absurd it was impossibile to suspend disbelief. ..."
5,Great book!,"Yes, there were a few inconsistencies, but the story line was super. The characters and dialogue were better than standard, and the ""bad guys"" were really bad.The plot was somewhat complicated but I had no trouble following it. The body count was high, but the romance was very good. Yeah, Kane and AJ didn't hesitate to engage in sex at every opportunity, but there's enough action and danger to balance it.All in all, I thought this was a great book and plan to read more by this author."
4,"Better than the last 2, but not as good as the first","I loved Cherry Adair's first book about the sister. hated the second. Liked the third..so if you are with me so far..the fourth book is GOOD. The hero and herione are strong without being too neurotic..and the action is well paced. there is some stuff in there that doesn't logically compute....and one love scene that is NOT possible if you have ever been on a camel.! really...it must be possible to make love on a camel..just not the way the author talks about it...Also, I hated the ending...it seems like Cherry Adair books can only end one way--with the hero-heroine running madly trying to outrace an explosion (same ending as the last two)!!"
4,Cherry Adair does it again,"Let me start by saying that this is not her best book but it does not dissapoint, it is a very good read fast paced, and far from boaring,this is one book I will read again."
1,What a shame!,"I was eagerly looking forward to the newest installment of Cherry Adair books, boy was I disappointed. The story, characters and sex were so weak. This is not in the same category as her previous books. I do not recommend this one!"
2,I hope this one was just a bad fluke...,"I've been a big fan of Cherry Adair since her first book in the Wright series. It seems, however, that with each consecutive book, the quality has diminished. This one was a utter disappointment. The summary of this book made me want to buy it right away. Imagine my sadness, when instead of being transported into an exciting and sexy story, I was treated to a science fiction novel filled with a dirty sandcrusted couple traipsing across the desert. Even though Kane seemed like a hottie, I couldn't understand why he would want to spend time with A.J. the one dimensional robocop. The sex scene on the camel was one that I will never forget (not a good thing). Sex and romance sells, I want to see more of it in Cherry's next novel or she will lose this reader."
2,Declining series,"I enjoyed the other books in this series, though strangely, it seemed to me that each successive book was a step down from the one preceeding it. Kiss & Tell remains the strongest and most enjoyable. By the time I got to Out of Sight, the decline in reading pleasure had sunk so low that I was unable to finish the story. I was completely turned off by the self-centeredness of the heroine. Her inability to see the larger picture in life and death situations endangered not only herself but others, and ultimately led to the death of another character. She seemed less troubled by this than she was with proving herself, which I found contemptible. My two stars are for the hero, who deserved a much better woman. I'll be waiting for Ms. Adair's newest entry, On Thin Ice, to be released in paperback before purchasing. I sincerely hope this series, which began with so much potential, will get back on track. The author has a lot of talent, and I'm looking forward to better things from her."
2,"So disappointed! Too much terrorism, not enough romance.","I waited SOOOO long for this book. I'm a huge Cherry Adair fan. Like most of the other reviewers, I found this book to be very disappointing. Part of the problem was that the action part of the book (involving chasing Osama-like terrorists, doomsday machines, potential mass casualties) was just too intense. To have the main character experiencing a romance in the midst of this terror was just ridiculous. I was too freaked out by all the terror to really buy their ability to jump each other in the midst of severe danger. This formula CAN work if handled gently... for example, Suzanne Brockmann does it with her Navy SEALS. I'm really hoping that Cherry Adair scales back the terror and cranks up the romance in her next book!!!"
1,Ruined the Wright Family Series...,"What a major disappointment! I was eagerly awaiting the new book in Ms. Adair's Wright Family series, and it was a total flop. Is she just pounding out the words to finish this series or what? I thought she was a fabulous up and coming. It turns out she came and went. What was she thinking?These two characters had no connection whatsoever, unless you count the sex. Which by the way was pretty far fetched and not at all hot and bothering like her previous novels. I don't recommend this one at all. What a shame"
1,Uneven story line makes for a bumpy read !!!,This will be my last Cherry Adair book for awhile! Her writing is starting to become tiresome and boring. I think Ms. Adair has lost her edge. Think I'll go back to Stella Cameron for sizzling romance or perhaps PC Cast (a new writer that I enjoy as of late.)
2,severly lacking,Ms. Adair's current novel is a dramatic departure from her previous ones. It severly lacking any depth of character and reads more like a poor attempt at erotica. She is capable of so much better than this.
4,Not like the others...,"Kane Wright has one objective, to kill a terrorist. Although against it, Kane follows his orders to take rookie sharpshooter A.J Cooper with him on this assignment. When she cracks under the pressure, Kane doesn't care how she looks or makes him feel, he's taking her down.A.J Cooper spent her whole childhood relying on her looks. When she went out into the big bad world, she knew that she didn't want to count on her looks for success. Joining T-FLAC, she had the highest goal, which goes up in smoke the day that she screws up the op.Although I immensely enjoyed Out of Sight, it didn't hold a candle to the three previous Wright books. Although high on suspense, it was low on romance, which was a big dissapointment. Adair endeared her writing to me with her humorous, yet dramatic approach at love which was most noticeably absent in this book. If you haven't read this series, don't start with this book. Kiss and Tell is still my favorite :)"
3,Great characters...but choppy storyline......,"Kane Wright was definately the selling point of this book. His character alone made it worth the read. That's about it. Parts of the storyline were choppy, leaving this reader having to turn back a few pages to see if I missed something.The best parts of the book were when Kane would make up names for what A.J. stood for. Bottom line. Lot's of sex with no emotion. Definately not in the same league with Kiss and Tell, but deserves to be read..at least once...but, is not ""keeper shelf"" quality."
3,out of mind.,"I've read the T-FLAC books in order, and totally loved each one until now. Out of sight had me so bored that I skimmed it from page 200-end. I just couldn't muster up emotion or excitement for these two or their story.I can't exactly explain why- just that I was bored and it felt tired and unoriginal. Like this Wright brother needed his own book... but there's not much that makes him especially interesting or stand apart from his studly (superior in my mind) brothers."
3,GREAT COVER BUT NOT SO GREAT STORY,"Three stars!!! Who would have thought I'd ever give Cherry Adair such a low rating. Unfortunately, this story just didn't do it for me. It isn't because I don't like strong female leads. I do. I'm not sure if it was lack of character development, lack of story development or what. This story just wasn't up to this author's usual standards. Let's hope it's not a new trend. For a 5 star book, try UNDRESSED by Stef Ann Holm."
4,best so far,"the best of the series so far. Her writing is subpar and repetetive ""limp like an overcooked noodle"" ..but the book was fun and definitely better than On thin ice , her latest offering which I find boring. what I liked about this book was the kick-ass heroine. what a refreshing change from the simpering idiots in the rest (Delanie being the worst)."
1,Poorly structured,Past experience with speedwriting well thought out and clearly described has much to do with my disappointment with this method. I believe the general rules are sound enough but little real guidance and a poor presentation on the pages diminishes the effort.
4,Easy Script,"I felt that the book gave a lot of important information on how to train ones self on the basic learning of speed writing. I wish I had gotten the whole package, with the tape, to really get the process down."
5,Claude Challe Rules!,I have come to appreciate world beats and music from all around because of this great master we call Claude Challe. I saw Claude in a live concert he did in Lebanon in the summer of 2003. It was a night of complete grooviness. He just made it feel so magical. Ask anyone and they'll say they were in a trance that night.Claude Challe has been able to capture the essence of good music. This CD will surely persuade you. Buy it...you'll discover what music is all about.I first started listening to this music when i borrowed the Buddha Bar III CD from a friend and it just blew my mind away. Ever since ive been hooked up on this music. Then I celebrated my 18th Birthday at the Buddha Bar in Paris. Imagine how i felt!!If you want to feel like you have no worries in the world (atleast for a nite) you better get those CDs! Claude Challe Rules!
4,Good. Allergy alert!!! for those with (iodine) shellfish allergies.,"The metamoyson dual protein may be better, but a little less tasty than the ""Pure Protein"" brand name ""chocolate deluxe"".The ""sugar alcohols"" (sweetener) are also hard on those with blood acid issues.DOES need at least a glass of water like all these protein bars. Sticky in throat without plenty to drink."
2,i regret buying his,i regret buying this because its not a meal replacement bar. its a very thin fudge chocolate bar that only adds protein to your diet. if you want mass then dont get this bar if your looking to lose weight and want more protein in your diet without losing your chocolate treats then this might be the bar for you.
3,"Thick, but tastey","The chocolate fudge deluxe bars taste good, but are quite chewy and difficult to put down. I'll probably buy them again, since I have not seen other varieties of the reduced sugar."
1,Bad Choice,I received the GE Slimline radio as a Christmas gift and just recently had it installed. The radio presets did not work at all and the CD portion of the unit was also totally inoperative. It looks nice in the kitchen but thats about it. GE should take them off the market!!
1,Ditto with the CD Player Not Working,"Have exactly the same problem with the CD player; was thinking of having it repaired or replacing it but thanks to all of your reviews I realize that I would be wasting my money! Thank-you,"
1,"Waste of time, money and effort.","Purchased two of these and returned both. Even new CDs skipped from the day it was installed. Contacted GE for advice,was told to ship the unit to them at my expense for a possible reconditioned unit. Made no sense as I could return it to the store for another new one! I really wish I had read these reviews before buying."
1,CD player (in original and replacement) never worked!,"This is a nice radio, but the CD player did not work in the first one we received (as a Christmas present); we went through the process of getting it replaced, hooked up the new one, and the CD player in that one did not work either.This thing stinks.D7k777"
1,A terrible CD Player,"I bought two of these units. The first purchase worked, then the CD player became unable to identify the CD to be played and would give a ""No CD Present"". After cleaning the CD's, and the player itself, it continued until it no longer played any CD's. GE's quality control is terrible. I since brought this one back and returned it for the same model, and the same issues are creeping back. This is garbage. Go for the Sony model if possible."
1,"My CD player didn't work, either!!","My son sent me this kitchen radio for Christmas. I installed it without checking to see if it worked. Well, it never played a CD!! It would say ""no CD"", so I took it to a repair shop, thinking something happened during shipping. They couldn't fix it. It's a shame that the GE brand isn't what it used to be. I'll have to tell my son because I'm sure not buying another GE!!"
1,Believe the bad reviews...,"I don't know why GE bothers to keep producing and selling this POS. Just like most of the reviews here, we put CD upon CD in ours and it wouldn't recognize ANY of them. Go for the Sony. But if you do purchase this one...TRY THE CD PLAYER BEFORE YOU START DRILLING HOLES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Listen to the reviewers!,"I just KNEW I should have paid attention to all the problems previous reviewers had with this product. However, I really, really wanted a light on my radio/CD player so I went ahead and got this model. I purchased the first, it wouldn't recognize the CD. I got a second, it wouldn't recognize the CD (are you sensing a pattern here?). I even tried a third, after I had an employee at the store test it, but the CD player stopped working after one CD. I have officially given up on the GE and MIGHT consider a Sony, but they don't get stellar reviews either. What is one to do?"
1,disappointed,I am also returning the spacemaker for the second time. It quit playing CD's as others have stated. I loved this feature in the kitchen. Disappointed in the GE label.
2,This one's not worth the effort,"Despite the suprisingly good sound, this audio system is an utter disappointment and worthless for its intended purpose. The system has no external radio antenna and most likely won't get reception underneath a cabinet. The cd player has trouble reading discs. Neither the troubleshooting guide or user's manual offers any guidance, and there is no live customer support."
1,Poor Performance,"I have to say the sound quality of this player is very good...when it's not skipping. Unfortunately, it skips all the time...even on brand new cds. We are taking it back. Although it looks really nice in the kitchen, the price is too much to pay for a cd player that skips.Believe the reviews...do not buy this cd player."
4,GE Spacemaker CD Radio,"I bought this for my own kitchen and it works great. The installation took only about 15 minutes. The presets were a little difficult to figure out but once I did, I set up about 8 to 10. The sound is good enough for a kitchen, plus it has two setting for the light. I use it every day."
1,Disappointing replacement,"I bought this to replace an aging GE 74250 Spacemaker radio, but what a disappointment! Its additional depth makes it impossible to install under a standard 12"" cabinet if you also have a tile wall backdrop, without either modifying the light housing or protruding the front edge out. Though in the same place, the FM reception is noticably worse than the older version, regardless of how I route the power cord. The radio sounds tinny and poor quality by comparison. The CD sounds better, but I've already noticed intermittent skipping or sticking on 3 different, relatively new CDs."
1,Both GE and Sony undercounter cd players have not worked!!,"Am getting ready to return my second ""under counter kitchen cd/radio""--my Christmas gift from my husband, too!! Both the GE and the Sony sound great with the radio, but produce only a small hissing sound when the cd player is on. You can get a radio anywhere; it's the cd player I was looking forward to. Incredibly frustrating; am suspecting they're all made in the same factory in China and all have the same defects. At least I tried this one before drilling more holes in the bottom of my cupboard!! In any case, am not sure what I'll do next, but this is really disappointing and annoying. I'm envious of the few reviewers here who have had a great experience, but am not willing to invest more time in this quest!!"
1,A PIECE OF JUNK -NEGATIVE STARS,Six Sigma my ass. The CD player has NEVER worked. I thoughtJack Welch was supposed to be the guru of quality
1,CD player does not work,Just got this as a X-mas gift for my wife and the CD player now can only play one song before it says there is no disk. I am returning it for another brand.
4,Great addition to my kitchen,"Bought this radio a couple weeks ago and really like it. The sound is not as good as a Bose type, but it's okay. The CD player has worked great for me, no problems with skipping. It also plays CD's I created myself. The remote doesn't have a lot of features on it, but then don't really need a lot. My husband installed it for me and only took him about 15 minutes. The hardest part was getting it centered on my cabinet. I got it on sale though, not sure I would have paid the full price. I would recommend it for anyone who wants to add some music to their kitchen. Great product so far."
1,sorry tink,i thought this tea set was much bigger when i ordered it online..it's great for barbie but not my daughter.
4,Captured On Corregidor,"A very interesting read. The story is well organized and relates the author's experiences from the surrender of Corregidor, internment by the Japanese, to his liberation. I assumed it would be about the Bataan Death March, but it was not. An eye opener on another phase of WW II history."
5,Dark guardian,"This was my introduction to vampire anime. It is about a vampire with no memory of his mortal past fighting to save humanity from the darkness that he now dwells in. He is aided by a demonic fairie, a very beautiful human detective and his perky secretary, who also happens to be a vampire. And dwelling in the shadows is a former lover who wishes to drag our hero back into the darkness. If you like your anime extream, yet with a little tenderness, then this is the ticket."
4,Midnight Detective,"This is the first installment of the ""Nightwalker"" series. This DVD contain episodes 1-7. Great start for such a cool vampire series. The series follows a vampire named Shido who fights crimes against the ""nightbreeds"". Shido has also vowed not to take another human life.He has some help along the way, which include:Yayoi - a beautiful agent who works for the NOSRiho - a cute teenage girl who works for Shido, but also has a crush on himand last, but definitely not least, Gumni(may have misspelled it) - a cute, green little demon who, in my opinion, works as a conscience for ShidoI don't want to say too much about ""Midnight Detective""; I don't want to ruin it for those who haven't seen it. But if you like vampires and anime, you may want to check this out. It's not VHD, but it's still cool!!"
3,audio track ripoff,"While the series itself is decent, the audio selections of these disks are lacking. The original single releases of this series are bilingual (Japanese and English), however, for some reason, the ""complete"" set has removed the original Japanese entirely. For those fans that don't care how the English sounds, this probably won't phase you at all. However, for those who prefer the Japanese audio don't bother wasting your money on this."
4,NightWalker is the best anime-vampire series I've seen.,"The story starts off with Shido, a vampire detective who is trying to repent for his evil past by helping innocent humans. This is a much used plot line, I know, but that never bothered me once I watched it. (( I currently own 3 tapes in the series )) I like Shido - he is humorous in his flirtations, AND he is just plain cool to look at... *drool* Yayoi, the female cop helping him, is also awesome, and I think the interaction between her and Shido (( they have a fling going )) is half the reason why I buy it. Riho, though, the perky, cliche' girl in the series is just ANNOYING. Why does EVERY series have to make it a point to have a high-voiced school-girl in love with the hero??! ARG! Anyways, NightWalker is a good series and I reccomend it. Some of the episodes are fillerish, with no real relevance to the main plotline, but its amusing just the same."
4,Anyone know what CD has the opening song on it?,"Good show, GREAT opening song! I just love it! Does anyone know if there's a CD with that song on it? Or the name of it at least? I just have to have that song!"
3,just a little small.,if you have to wear a jockstrap then this would be a good one but go up a size as they can run a little small. it was tight in the waist and a little cramped in the pouch at least the material was soft.would buy it again just a little bigger next time.
3,Somewhere between heaven and hell,"I bought this cd player to replace my broken philips cd player because i broke the screen. At first the rca was good until i was using for 5 hours straight and the batteries died.My philips lasted at least 10 hours.The other reason i dont like it because any slight touch of the slide it pops right open. Last I hate the color. Other than those reasons the anti-skip is good,mp3 cds load fast, no promblems so far."
2,Don't Buy This,"MINE WONT PLAY MY BURNED CD's!!!! It says that its ""looking for files"" for 10 minutes than shuts off. I dont understand, sound is weak, it wont play cd's, it was expensive when i got it too. If you want a good mp3 cd player...get the Rio Volt or just get an mp3 player or a cd player."
2,DON'T BUY THIS!!!!!!,"i originally wanted the sony psyc cd player, but i browsed around, saw this had mp3 capabilities, and bought this instead. i took it home, and before i opened it, i looked at the review on here. almost all of them said that the headphones suck, so i opened it and thought i would give them a try...TRUST ME, THEY SUCK!!! do not buy this unless you are looking more for features rather than sound quality - i ended up taking mine back b/c the sound sucked so much! i also got the sony psyc cd player - muuuccchhhh better!"
2,Some major problems,"I bought this cd player because it had the 2 features I needed: mp3 playback and car kit. The car kit works, but I had to go through extra steps with knowledgeable friends because the poor manual has almost no instructions. Worse is mp3 playback - 1 out of 5 songs CANNOT be read. When that happens, the player simply freezes, and you have to unplug the AC adapter and replug it in. I use this mainly for my car, and I have had to unplug the adapter from the cig lighter, plug it back in, turn on the power, select the music and hit play, too many times, WHILE DRIVING. And that will only last maybe 20 minutes, and I have to go through the same steps again.My conclusions is the cd player is extremely unreliable in the mp3 playback department. I have had enough, and this player is going back to the store.AVOID."
2,"Decent Features, and weak, weak, weak sound.","This was the first mp3/cd player I've bought. Let me start with bad. The sound on this would make your grandma bored. It almost has no bass or mid. It's just a mono sound. It's also very fragile, I dropped it once and it's been acting up ever since. And it's ugly!! The only good I can say is it has a decent menu. Pretty User friendly. If you're an audiophile and need sound, SOUND!! Look somewhere else. And if you're not an audiophile, do the same."
1,garbage,i got this as a gift and it started out for the first month or so working fine. now whenever i try to listen to a cd all it does is skip. i ended up going back to the cheap $20 gpx one that i had before i got this one. the only reason i switched is because it was a gift and i thought it might be a little better. but now i realized that i was wrong. do not waste your money on this.
2,Look around before you buy this,I got this player because normally I find that non-name brand players work just as well as other brands. This player has a hard time reading my MP3 files and skips on brand new CDs as well. The audio is pretty weak too. I would suggest to keep looking before you decide to by this.
3,"FEATURES=EXCELLLENT, AUDIO QUALITY=BAD",".Pros: Has all the features I could expect from a MP3/WMA player, i.e.: you can do a mix and match of MP3s & WMAs of even different bit rates within a same folder and it will play it!""Functionnalywise"" I give it 9/10Cons: The unit does not play loud enough (tried with several types of headphones)NO BACKLIT! -> forget about the benefits of the ID tag feature in the dark...VERY ANNOYING ELECTRICAL NOISE IN HEADPHONES AT LOW VOLUME.I often used the player in bed at low volume. In that particular case, you can easily hear an electrical noise generated by the circuitry of the player. For that only reason, I have returned the unit to the store because music quality is more important than the features. I can't think of a product affected by such a problem was released on the market....sorry RCA, you have to work harder on the noise reduction design before convincing me...With these cons fixed, this product would beat all competition at that price!"
2,Doesn't work!,"i received this as a gift from my mother. Those of you pureeing meat in your food mill --- do we have the same product????? Mine has a plastic grate. I **barely** mashed up some cooked peas in this thing. I can't imagine getting meat through this! That ""blade"" is like a dull butter knife. It worked great with a ripe avocado, and that was about the end of that. You really need three hands to get this working - two to push down and stabilize at the same time (I have to press really really hard), and a third to turn the handle. I have yet to be able to successfully turn the handle and press at the same time in any effective fashion. You also have to get messy to get the grate disk off, the only way to do it is to press down on the dirty grate with your thumbs and work it off. When it's covered in a slick puree that's not easy. Also, the plastic stains easily. I put a watermelon chunk in there, and now it's permanently stained orange. It's a great concept, but I would NOT buy this."
2,Good for selected foods,Great idea but didn't work for me for most of the foods that I cook. It was very hard to grind anything that wasn't very soft and/or very moist and meats were especially hard. Easy to wash.
4,"Good, with limitations","Once your child is past the first stage of baby food, this mill is an affordable way to quickly prepare meals for your baby. It will not give you a silky-smooth puree, but the textures of the food are fine for my 8-month old. I'm definitely glad I didn't spring for an expensive baby-food maker!"
2,Difficult to use,"This grinder is so difficult to disassemble - the food gets stuck in there and it's almost impossible to dislodge the strainer plate. Also, it has very small capacity so trying to remove the pieces to reload gets messy and annoying. I'm going to buy the real deal: stainless steel, large bowl and a blade that comes off easily."
4,Good Value for money,"I bought this product few days back and has been very satisfied with the performance. Only drawback is that if the food has some liquid in it.. because of the absence of adequate liquid seal, it makes a mess inside the box ...but I will recommend this product to anyone."
4,"Good quality, but didn't get to use very long.","I bought this to use when we went out to eat, and it worked just fine to mush up the restaurant food into baby-puree. Unfortunately, my baby decided to wean herself off mushy foods far sooner than expected, so we didn't get to use it very long."
1,Sent different item. the one shown discontinued. too bad!!!,"This product as shown in the picture, is an excellent food grinder for baby products or foods for elderly. It has changed over the years and at one point it had a metal blade that they need to put back in to this one, that now has a plastic blade.It is unfortunate though, that the company that manufactures this item came out with a newer version, some odd oblong shaped grinder that doesnt process enough food for a serving. It is harder to handle and is so disappointing. What ever they were trying to do, save money on parts or whatever reason, the new one is a huge fail in my opinion.I am seeking out their old product and have purchased and used them for almost 15 years, fortunately I have the old metal blades to use for the past version with the cheap plastic blade."
1,AWFUL!,"If I could give this product less than 1 star, I would. My Mom told me that all's I needed was a grinder to feed my baby, so I bought this one. It never ground up a single piece of food. My Mom was convinced that maybe I was doing it wrong and she had the same experience. Her reaction was ""they just don't make things they way they use to."" It was a waist of money and after many attempts, it ended up in the trash. We ended up using a fork to mash soft foods and a small food processor for bigger stuff. My next baby, I hope to invest in the Beaba Baby Cooker."
4,Love it!,"My only complaint about this product is it doesnt easily cut up foods that havent been cooked to the point of falling apart. It will still chop and mash them but it will take more muscle and coordination. It doesnt really have a blade to cut the food, more of a metal bar that chops off pieces of food as its passing through the platic grate. Use this when Im out at a friends house or at a restuarant where I cant use the Magic Bullet to chop my LOs food. The carrying case keeps everything contained far as used parts until Im able to get home to wash them. My LO was in heaven when he could start eating the same food as Mommy. All around great product for stage two and stage three eaters. I would still stick with a blender or a Magic Bullet if you are grinding beginning eaters at the stage one level though."
1,rating for Baby Haven not food mill,"I purchased this mill with carrying case as a gift. It arrived late and the box was in poor condition because Baby Haven shippers stuffed it in a large manilla envelope to mail it. I requested to return it because it was not gift worthy, Baby Haven agreed and sent me a Return number on Jan 3. I mailed it back properly in a shipping box on Jan 9 with a delivery confirmation requested. It was delivered to Baby Haven on Jan. 11. I never received an acknowledgment or credit for my return. I will not purchase anything from Baby Haven again."
2,Wastes food,"Very disappointed in this food mill. It does not grind all of the food in the cylinder. It leaves a good 1/2 in. of food unmilled. Also the mill I received is not the one pictured. I received the one with the cloth carrying case.I had a food mill for my babies 35 years ago and I wish I had kept it! It worked much better. It had a sharper blade and milled all of the food, including meats and fish. This mill is ""ok"" for soft foods like bananas, but not meats or fish. Even when liquids are added, it does not meet my expectations."
3,So-So,"With my first baby I thought we had to feed her mushed up food. So we got this food grinder. It is really annoying to use, hard to get the grate off once you get the food through and a real waste of time. I now know better, we will be following baby led weaning."
2,Plastic grate- misleading photo,The grate is now made with plastic instead of metal. This makes it very hard to push the food through. Basically it will only work for foods like sweet potatoes and foods that are already very mushy. Even very overcooked peas wouldn't go through the grate. Maybe it would work for canned veggies? Would not recommended...
1,Dull Blade and Problem with Leakage,"Even though the blade is steel it took way too much work to get this food mill to mash up food. I put in some apple pieces and had to stand up at the table and push down with all my might while turning the handle to get the mill to work. Even then, it did a very poor job of grinding AND juice from the fruit leaked out the bottom of the mill. We also tried with bananas and got the same result. The plastic construction also gives it a flimsy and unstable feeling. Once, when pushing down while grinding, the whole thing slipped and tipped over.Worthless! I returned the product and will be buying a quality, heavy-duty food mill, even though it will cost me more."
1,Not impressed,"I used this item 3 times and now it's sitting in a cabinet. It's messy and there is very little space to put any food. I think you would be better off simply mashing your own food in a big bowl. It's a good concept, but not a well made product."
2,"poor quality, dishonest description","I ordered b/c we owned one several years ago for my 2 older children. We loved it and used it often. For my new baby, I decided to order the same one. The price is higher, but the description still said ""stainless steel strainer"". The strainer is, in fact, white plastic. So for more money, the company is producing a cheaper product. Very disappointed, and won't recommend this to anyone."
4,works ok,"The main part works well, but the carrying case was cracked when delivered, so I'm not sure how well the carrying case works."
1,broken and rusted,"my husband and i were very excited to get this a day earlier than expected, only to be very sorely disappointed that the carrying tote was broken when we opened the box. what's even worse is the metal rod that helps attach the blade to the mill looked dirty and rusted! i wonder if this was returned before!amazon was quick to refund us. their reseller made a complete mess out of this order."
1,Extremely Dissapointed,"I'm a nanny and the family I work for has an older version of it and it works great, so I went ahead and ordered one for my baby girl. I was very dissapointed when I opened the box and found that the ""medical grade stainless steel blade"" has been replaced by the manufacturer for a cheap plastic one. The box it came in still says that it comes with the stainless steel one though, even the picture on Amazon shows it, I find this misleading. It's really frustrating to find that what you end up getting is not what was advertised."
1,Kidco Food Mill...not a good choice,"I was so excited to get the Kidco Food Mill and just as disappointed once I tried using it. First of all, it mashed the food. The grate is plastic and the blade isn't sharp at all. Don't let the picture on the box deceive you (with the metal grate). I think having metal turning against metal would help...not to mention a sharp blade. It is difficult to remove the plastic grate after you have sent food through because the handle unscrews from the grate before you can get it to turn and ""unlatch"". I spoke with a customer service rep where I purchased this item and she told me that the plastic grate was a fairly new change."
3,Pretty good,"This food mill does an ok job for what I paid for it. My grinder blades were steel, unlike some other reviewers who said it was plastic, unless they were referring to the screen that sits on top of the grinder which is plastic. It is very convenient for on the go use; it is small and fits nicely in the diaper bag. My only complaint is that it's difficult to get the screen on and off. It is a ""turn to lock"" type of fitting, but you do this by means of the turn handle which always turns freely without stopping. Ultimately I have to stick my finger in the bowl to lock/unlock it in order to secure blade or pull it out for cleaning. It's not that big of a deal but it is annoying after the bowl is dirty and full of baby food. Over all, I would recommend this to a friend. It's inexpensive, functional, and easy to clean once taken apart."
1,It Rusts!,"I was excited to try this product so that we could share our homemade food with our baby girl. I used it once to grind spaghetti and meatballs (more of a blunt crushing action than true grinding). Our baby was not quite ready for the consistency of the food, so I promptly hand-washed all the parts in warm water and mild dish detergent and let it air dry in the dish rack. When I went back to use it after a week, I discovered a reddish ring had formed underneath the grinder ring between the ring and the blade. At first I thought it must be pasta sauce that I had missed but upon further inspection it is undoubtedly RUST! I would have assumed any kitchen utensil that would repeatedly be exposed to water would be made of stainless steel but this appears not to be the case! The ""grinder"" is now sitting in our garbage can."
3,A little disappointed,"I heard a lot of good things about this device so I ordered one. From the way it was described it sounded pretty easy to use and for the most part it is. EXCEPT in actual use, it was much harder to push down in order to get the chunks of fruits through (I used apples and even after peeling the skin) it wasn't easy and all the while spinning the handle to do the puree. If I'd known it would be this difficult I probably would have opted for an electric model."
2,Great customer service,While I was disappointed the Food Mill had a plastic strainer rather than a steel one like the one I used for 5 kids (they do carry a model now that has the steel strainer disc which I highly recommend) the customer service when going through the return process was great. The company stands behind their products 100% and were very pleasant to work with. I would definitely purchase other products from them again.
2,Kidco Food MIll,"The food mill is very convinient if you are feeding your baby bland table food and just wish to grind up enough for one meal. But it is a horrible pain to clean the top handle piece that is connected to the strainer, it is almost impossible to remove and has no leverage to help get it off."
1,Didn't work for me,"I am VERY disappointed with this product. It worked the first two times I tried it, with an apple and a pear. I tried it again this morning with an apple and couldn't get it to grate the apple at all. I think the blade has dulled... Anyway, I am thoroughly unimpressed and will be returning it."
5,Great Money Saver,The food mill is great for making baby food. My kids ate nothing but food we made at home. We bought this for our nephew and his wife and they love it. It is so easy to grind up what you are eating and let your baby enjoy good home cooking from an early age. Highly recommend this for all new parents!!!!!!!
3,"It's OK, works in a pinch","Works fine. Just a little cumbersom. I find using it at Grandma's and my friends, sometimes. I make large batches in my food processor, or just smash up the food with my fork.3 stars, good product, just not as useful as I'd thought."
2,Totally Useless,"First we bought an adult sized food mill, great for Thanksgiving mashed potatoes, not so great for baby-sized portions. So we bought this food mill, which is clearly kid sized. BIG MISTAKE! It was hard to use, because it is plastic and needs a lot of muscle to grind things that aren't actually cooked too death. Hard to assemble, because of all the plastic bits, they tend to disappear when reloading or washing. It makes enough for one meal, so unless you cook only a bit of a bit of something, you are going to have to reload. Be careful when you are grinding, because if it tips at all, the mashed up food will just slide right out of the top. And hand-wash it! We put it in the dishwasher and it warped, so now it is very difficult to use. After a week of suffering with this do-hickey, we received a mini-food processor and I nearly cried with gratitude. It works! It's wonderful. And it doesn't cost much more."
1,useless and deceptive,"no sharp parts to process food! when i received this, i thought the stainless steel 'grater' part was missing. i called kidco and what they sent me was already included in the box. this mill is made almost entirely of plastic and has no sharp parts that are able to process anything tougher than ripe fruit. it basically just mashes very soft things through a plastic strainer. it is also difficult to take apart for cleaning. i'm sending it back."
3,Convenient,"I like that batteries are not needed for this food mill. Very convenient. However, the case is made of plastic and doesn't serve a purpose because it's too bulky. However, the actual mill is wonderful."
4,Very handy for the baby who wants table food,So far I've tried this mill with soft foods such as ravioli and diced chicken and it works very well. Some other reviewers have complained that the user has to push too hard. I imagine that this is because they started with pieces that were too big. Cut up whatever you're milling and it should work just fine. The strap on the carrying case was difficult to attach but since it's so small it's hardly useful anyway.
5,Greg Raymer Sunglasses,"No one can see you're ""bluffing"" with these on! They're perfect! Great quality for playing poker! Not real good while driving, but absolutely perfect at the poker table! You might want to get two pairs of these just in case you lose one; I did!"
4,awesome,"looked sweet and made everyone laugh during poker, only thing is they are kind of small, other than that, everythings awesome"
5,Greg raymer review - Shipping to Portugal (Europe),"Length:: 1:33 MinsI buy this item from amazon and it was delivery in a few days. USA to Portugal, excelent conditions!!My friends from [...] all love that item, and they really want one of that!"
2,Pompous Know-It-All?,"Listen, I've never read all the way through this book...but hear me out! Celia is given credit as an early enthusiast for lucid dreaming and helped make the practice well-known, or more so, in popular culture. But she admits to not ever having a lucid dream, at least, not before publishing this book. Hm? Elsewhere, she goes on and on about being a child genius and how the world is set-up against her type. Take some responsibility! Any way, you may want to read this just to saturate your mind with everything available about lucid dreaming, or as a historical artifact. I've heard that ""Celia was spot-on when she proposed the idea that lucid dreaming most likely happens during REM-sleep."" No kidding."
1,Very dangerous,We used this toy only once. The baby was going to come out of it and into the pool several times within that few minutes. Her legs did not seem to go far enough down for the balance to be right. Have had others (with older babies) that really worked well but this one was just not balanced right.
4,Seems to do the job,"I could have spent a day sanding, but I'm to lazy for that on this metal outside cabinet. I think maybe the better hammered finish comes from how thick you apply this paint and how smooth your metal is. My metal wasn't that smooth in places due to rust, but oh well, it's just an outdoor storage cabinet."
4,Beautiful Finish on my Molding,"The only reason I did not give this paint 5 stars is because it can run a bit and get a little blotchy. You really need to practice to make sure you get the lovely Hammered Metal look. If you take your time, it will come out gorgeous!"
2,Space Wolf - Poor,"This book isn't too bad for those who are loyal Warhammer 40k fans. However, this book is written in an annoying fashion. The author over-did it when it came to attempting to build atmosphere. The book was also not completely consistent with the Warhammer universe. There was also the problem about consistency in general. William King has got some misconceptions about helmets. He's got Marines spitting while wearing a helmet, etc.... If you read his short story, ""In the Belly of the Beast,"" he has a group of scouts (with the same names mentioned in this book) fighting Tyranids after they took off their helmets. Anyway, this book does have some interesting parts but I would suggest Barrington Bayley's: ""The Eye of Terror"" over ""Space Wolf"" any day."
2,"Whimpering ""Wolf""","This book is the kind of pulp SF juvenilia I expected the other Warhammer 40K books I've read to be and weren't (these include Eye of Terror and Dan Abnett's two Gaunt's Ghosts books). William King is just not a very good writer. The plot is not bad -- and it's very interesting to see how a tribesman from Fenris goes from being a primitive to being a Wolf -- but the writing is flat and poorly constructed. If you're dying to read about Space Wolves, you'll likely enjoy this book (although you won't even get as much background as can be found in the recentSpace Wolves issues of White Dwarf). If you want WH40 fiction AND surprisingly good writing, check out the books mentioned above."
3,WOLFMAN SPACE MARINES - COOL!,"William King's SPACE WOLF is a fun action/adventure sci-fi read. He never bogs you down with too much boring details but gets right down to the nitty gritty of space warfare. In this introduction to how a Space wolf is made, Ragnar is a young man in a primitive world, looking forward to his induction into manhood and love with a young woman of his tribe. When suddenly they are attacked by a revenge-seeking separate tribe led by a man that becomes Ragnar's nemesis. Both of them are mortally wounded and thats when the space marines take them in and literally change them to more than human space marines. Genetically altered and harshly trained, these proud few men become more than they can ever dream. This is a fun read and has a fast pace. If you like your sci-fi boiling with action and adventure like I do, then this ones for you!"
4,A good SPACE MARINE book.,"I've read all the W40K books so far and this is the only one that really deals with the ""adventures"" of a Space Marine. All the others might mention them or have a ""cameo"", but this is the only with a Marine as the central character. It was well written and engaging, despite that some of the technical pieces were off (the training of a Space Wolf). I'd recommend it to anyone wanting a good picture of what the space wolves are like. One of the best books in this genre (even though it was only about the lowly Imperial Guard) was First & Only by Dan Abnett."
3,NOT BAD BUT OUT OF DATE,"This isn't a bad book, but it's 20 years out of date. It was first published in 1976 and the reprint in 1992 doesn't add anything except a postcript saying all the the developments in reggae since it was first written are all rubbish. Reggae Bloodlines gives a good snapshot of reggae in the seventies, but it has been superseded by more up to date and comprehensive books like Reggae, Rasta, Revolution, The Reggae Rough Guide, and Reggae Routes : The Story of Jamaican Music."
4,Nice tool to your Palm PDA,"In the bombastic era from ipad and iphones if you prefer a palm that for you, great book"
2,Too much time telling you the obvious,"It's my belief that about 90% of what's written in computer books is excessive and unnecessary: there are a ridiculous number of them, they're overpriced, and they spend too much time telling you the obvious.Given that context, this is a good book by computer book standards, though clearly that's not much of a compliment. What I found most interesting were the reviews and suggestions regarding third-party software (and where to get same). Most of the rest consisted of rather obvious tips on how to use the existing software, of which I found about two to be of use. In other words, the useful parts of this 600-page book was about 50 pages or less.So if you're really at a loss on how to use your Palm Pilot, go ahead and get this book, or if you can buy it and deduct it on your taxes. Otherwise you're probably just about as well off doing a Web search as forking over ($) for a marginally useful book."
3,Alot of info,The title says how to do everything with your Pilot. My Pilot is an older one and there aren't any direct referances to it. The model number isn't even listed in the book. The information on this book is as unspecific to the product as the instructions that came with the Pilot.
4,"Great Book, except for couple little problems","well written (little too much ""sidenote"" jokes for my taste). Explains the basics very well. I really they covered using a Palm with a Mac a little more. The authors did not cover using a palm for GTD though..."
2,First 300 pages are no better than Palm's documentation,"The first half of the book cover many generalities and obvious points, most of which could be read from your Palm's manuals. It also covers many models, so you may not be sure exactly what applies to your toy.The second half of the book covers a lot of communication issues, independent add-on applications, security, and other in-depth topics. It does a good job explaining the security options available in Palm's newer OS and all of the permutations for sharing/protecting different levels of information."
5,Help At Last!,"I've finally found a book that gives me help with Palm basics and addresses current generation (Palm TX) products. The single biggest thing that sold me on this book were the explanations of WI-FI and Bluetooth; why does every other Palm ""how to"" book assume we know the ins and outs of the new technologies - if those technologies are included at all? The Troubleshooting Tips are succinct and well-documented. Also, Dave Johnson has a good sense of humor which adds value to any technical presentation for me."
3,Good Info. Out of Date,"I just purchased a Palm m515 and ordered this book as a help to get me started. The book covers a lot of information, but is for older models of PDAs. It is out of date. So if your looking for material for a new model PDA, look for a newer edition book."
2,Not a fan -- keep looking,"Returned this product... wasn't what I was hoping for... the spray coming out was more painful than enjoyable, no real settings to adjust the flow or type of spray... the free one I got from National Grid was a lot better."
5,Excellent Showerhead!,"Well, what can I say. If your looking for a great shower head that produces great outflow of water, then this is your product. It swivels with ease and it looks like a work of art! My old showerhead (purchased from local hardware store) did not have much water pressure. I thought it had to do with my city's water pressure outflow. When I installed the new Oxygenics shower head...WAHLAA! Problem Solved! I would highly recommend this product for anyone who is looking for a great showerhead. I will be purchasing another one for my kids shower."
1,noisy and very low water flow,"I was pretty happy with this Oxygenics unit for the two months I had it until I bought a WaterPik Linea for our other bathroom. What a difference!The Oxygenics unit made quite a lot of noise, almost like the roar of a jet engine from 300 feet away and had very low water flow. My hair never seemed to rinse clean of shampoo with this shower head. Oxygenics certainly pulls a good trick that probably works well for hotels trying to save water. The trick is that it feels like you're getting a decent amount of water, but your are really not.When I tried the WaterPik, the water flow was quiet, soft, and utterly comforting. And my hair rinsed very clean with the WaterPik. So I went out and bought another WaterPik to replace the Oxygenics.The Oxygenics unit is sitting in on my storage shelf now. Anybody want one?Oh and one last thing: The unit really does have too much cheap plastic that is easy to mar."
2,Short hair only,I bought the Oxygenics 5-star for my daughter to replace a water waster showerhead. She quickly complained because the stream of water was narrow and didn't rinse her long hair well. I sent the Oxygenics back and replaced it with the Delta Fluidics showerhead----it does the job. Plenty of pressure and capable of rinsing her hair.
3,Increases low-flow water pressure,"This showerhead helped to increase our once-anemic water pressure. A few flaws, however, is that the showerhead can be quite noisy as it's very obvious the showerhead is pushing through additional oxygen to accelerate the water pressure."
1,Not as listed. Not a 1.75GPM shower. It's 2.5GPM,"I ordered this as the description lists the shower head as:""Showerhead uses 1.75 gallons per minute at 60 psi...""It arrived today and it's a 2.5GPM shower head. I am attempting to be green by using less water and this isn't an upgrade.I will have to see what amazon can due.-Jason"
1,awful,This is a terrible showerhead. I returned it. Save your money & buy one for $5 anywhere. It will be better than this unbelievably bad product. I don't see how this can even be on the market at any price.
2,too noisey and poor temperature,"The water pressure was fine for low flow (we had great water pressure to begin with). Unfortunately, the noise was so loud it hurt my ears. Additionally, it cools the water down so much that even when using only hot water the shower was cooler than desired. We have small children, so increasing the heat of the water heater is not an option. I returned this product."
1,Poorly Manufactured...,"I have had this product for a little over 1 year and I am unable to clean it. There is a plastic coating on the face of the showerhead that is growing mold under it, and I am unable to clean it out no matter what I have tried. The chrome finish is also beginning to flake off. The shower itself is nice, and I love the adjustable lever to save water, but this is in essence a 1 year throw-away. At the price point it should last longer than that."
2,Very average,"When I bought it 8 months ago they were playing up the 'powerful spray' and 'non-corrosive' aspects of it, saying it's the last I'd own and was maintenance free. Not impressive. I sent a picture to the manufacturer b/c it's rusting and corroding and they told me to wash it with water and vinegar. I can't really replace it with a new one from them considering I'd need something to shower with, thus, will have to do with this one until it becomes too unsightly. Maybe for the price my expectations are too high, which I'd say, should be reflected in their marketing. I wouldn't recommend these folks, nor their product."
4,mmmm....lovely,"Lovely! If you want to feel good about your water consumption, lower your bills, be environmentally friendly BUT don't want to sacrifice a great shower spray for all these things, then THIS is the showerhead for you. It has a great spray when turned full on, and you can also reduce it to a trickle while you soap up, to save even more water.I recommend this. Worth every penny!"
1,Lasted 2 months,"Great price for good sound, but discs would get stuck inside.<br /><br />Died after 2 months of use. Taken 1 month to repair."
3,not on RCA web site,"The sound is great for some DVDs but low for other DVDs. Can not get any help from the RCA web site as other home theater systems are listed but not RTD 300. Lost the users manual and have not been able to find a replacement, to me this is unacceptable and dose not bode well for RCA support of their products."
4,What you see is what you get.,"This was an excellent deal. I will warn those attempting to install new decks themselves to research the issues associated with self installs on 03 Malibus as you can cause almost irreparable damage to the operation of your vehicle. Luckily I was able to install without issue, but a mechanic buddy of mine told me about the issues afterward and I discovered that I was very lucky indeed. There is an issue where doing the install can cause a theft security feature to engage in which the car dies randomly (Sometimes in the middle of driving!). Proceed at your own risk."
2,mediocre gig bag,i returned this. not worth the $ i would have saved. Tacky design and quality just ok.bought a roadrunner deluxe bag instead for the extra padding.
2,smells from in the other room!!!,"Have you ever forgot your laundry in the washer on a hot day? Ever smelled the stink of a new memory foam mattress? Combine them and that's what this gigbag smells like. Its in the other room with the door shut and I can still smell it. It stinks, plain and simple. Zipper got stuck right out of the box and the logo looks like it's for kids. Do not order this gigbag. I gave it a star because my Les Paul fits in it, another because it arrived....but that's all the merrit it has"
5,Great for the price!,"Great for the price. Guitar fits well, straps seem well made, nice pocket for odds and ends. No issues, at least not yet."
1,A CONTRACT MEANS YOU DO NOT HAVE FAITH IN YOUR SERVICE.,IF YOU PROVIDE GOOD SERVIOCE THEN YOU DO NOT NEED A CONTRACT. PEOPLE WILL STAY WITH YOU.
3,2-Year Contract,Well just want to say the contract should be one year not two years. Its too long to go with.
1,Cingular contract,"This was a terrible experience. I had already been with Cingular for years, currently on a monthly basis. I had to get a new phone number which was only the first problem. The biggest problem was getting the new service bundled with my land line phone bill as I had before. First I was billed for the old number and the new number. I was switched back and forth from Cingular to AT and T on the phone for hours, each claiming the other was responsible. Now, over a month later, I still do not have this settled."
1,I would not do it again if I had a choice,When I was buying a phone I was perhaps handled by some other company. Good luck with talking to customer service after you are on the contract. Be prepared to be on hold and get transferred between departments and waste precious hours of your life for nothing.
1,Don't beleive the rebate!,Don't beleive the rebate they promised you. I bought the two years contract & supposed to get $25 rebate. Amazon denied the rebate saying I have invalid wireless #. I'm still using the phone & I don't know how they came to that conclusion.
1,Be Careful if you want to transfer your number!,"I just transferred from T-Mobile and couldn't transfer my number. I'm a little upset because I have had that number for over ten years! Anyway, Amazon said it was that Cingular and Amazon don't have a process to transfer numbers and if you did the rebates would be invalid.Amazon actually explains this in some web page, but I didn't find it until after the fact. Overall, I think Cingular is pretty good in terms of quality, but their customer service it not so hot."
2,Raising a bar?,"My previous provider AT&T; was much more flexible, better with customers, easier to get a deal with and less in costs for the same minutes. I had more free time as well. And AT&T; never told us about ""raising a bar"". Now I have very bad reception in the areas were I never had problems with AT&T.; Service areas have much more ""black holes"" and if you are in the car you keep loosing your opponents. Customer service is trying to be friendly, but different representatives have different knowledge of the rules and each of them 100% sure in the things that they are saying.Family plans are not a big difference compare to pay separately for the each phone in the family.I will definitely try another provider when my contract is over."
3,AT&T UPGRADE FEE,"I'VE BEEN WITH AT&T/CINGULAR FOR YEARS. MY CONTRACT WAS UP NOV.08, I HAD TO BUY A NEW PHONE IN FEB.09. I HAVE ALREADY PAID THE UPGRADE FEE BEFORE. AND IT SAYS IT IS A ONE TIME FEE. THIS IS THE SECOND TIME I HAVE HAD TO PAY THE ONE TIME FEE.NOW IT BEING CALLED A CONTRACT EXTENSION FEE. I HAVE GONE FOR 3 MONTHS WITHOUT A CONTRACT BUT NOW THAT I HAD TO BUY A NEW PHONE, I'M GETTING THE FEE. BULL!!!!! THAT NEEDS TO BE RE-WORDED OR DISCONTINUED BECAUSE IT IS A LIE. MAYBE NEXT TIME I WILL LOOK INTO ANOTHER PHONE COMPANY THAT DOES NOT LIE."
1,Hit my credit.,Never had a bill payment problem in my life. I canceled a line. I finalized. 3 months later I got a collections statement for a charge I never paid. I was treated like a guilty child. Gotta have that unlimited data plan for the Iphone though.
2,Contract for low phone price?,"When you need to have a highend phone, you need to go with 2 yr contract, otherwise go for less."
3,Was Cingular`,"I still have AT&T. I do get dropped calls, but of all companies, I guess this is the best. NEVER GET VERIZON!!"
3,Can't port old #'s over on Cingular yet,"I would like to say that I am fairly happy with the Cingular service, however when purchasing through Amazon.com I spoke with an Amazon representative who told me I would be able to port my old # over on a Cingular account. However after purchasing my phone I found this to be false. It was later explained to me that I would have to cancel my contract and forfeit all savings and deals to do this. Oddly, amazon has it set up so you can port #'s over for all other carriers.Otherwise, I've found my old service US Cellular gets reception where Cingular does not, such as in the underground L tunnels in chiago. And I've had both phones on me at the same time when finding this out, on multiple occassions."
1,DO NOT BUY PHONES FROM AMAZON,Both of the phones that I purchased through amazon had to be replaced - they were both defective! What a pain! I also lost all of my numbers on one of the phones!!! It's better to just buy them directly from ATT.
2,2 year contract is suck.,"Two year contract is a nightmare. You have to stick with a bad cell services (weak signal, call failed, terrible voices) for 2 years long."
1,"Existinv Cingular Customers Beware of Amazon ""Deals""","I purchased a Motorola razr with a 2 year contract through Amazon. I had planned to move my existing cingular phone number (not under contract) to the new contract, which Amazon suggested was possible. Only after the phone was delivered and I looked at the fine print of Amazon's $150 rebate did I find out that Amazon can't move the number and Cingular will be forced to cancel the existing contract and create a new one. This process causes Amazon to lose their commission on the contract and void the rebate. To make a long story short I'm out $150 because Amazon didn't make it clear that existing Cingular customers should avoid their ""deal"" like the plague. This should have at least been a question during the checkout process, if not spelled out explicitly in giant red letters at the top of the screen."
1,cingular 2 year contract BEWARE!,"I made the unfortunate mistake of going with Cingular again. I can't believe how stupid I am. I had a 2 year contract before and a month brefore it expired I bought a couple phones and Cingular 2 yr service from Amazon.com. After I got the phones and activated them was told by Cingular (after 6 calls) it is impossible to have old phone numbers for the two new accounts, unless I paid to have old accounts reactivated. THen I would have 4 contracts????. My son went with team mobile after buying phone from Amazon and had his old Cungular number transfered to his new phone in 30 minutes. I am totally disappointed with Cingular and after this contract expires will never use them again. They just don't care. Lee"
2,Welcome Kit!!,"I signed for this contract just for free Razar phone. Just after 1 week T-mobile came up with same deal but with 1yr contract. So I thought of returning the phone and taking up T-mobile service. But I didn't, because of the contract and cancellation fees. The welcome kit arrived after 40 days and it said I can cancel the service without any chanrges within 30 days. It was posted exactly after 30 days !! Beware !!So far the service is OK."
1,# 1 worst customer service in usa,"cingular is worst service i have ever seen in usa. customer service is worst in columbia, sc. and dont expect the hand set will be working properly when buy it with cingular service. they wouldn't give you unlock code to use ur handset wherever u want. they want u to stick with them even afeter 2 years long contract with worst service. i heard T-mobile has good connectivity and customer service in other states through my friends. if i have a chance to choose between cingular and T-mobile i would go with T-mobile. so think before you go with cingular."
1,Need advanced warning of non portability of old numbers.,The deal on the phones were great but I was not aware that I could not port my old phone #s from Sprint without voiding my contract with Cingular and incurr a termination fee. The solution is either stick with the new phone #s I was assigned and make EVERYONE concerned aware of this or return everything and start all over with a new contract with Cingular. I wish Amazon would have raised a flag too warn us about this BEFORE I purchased the phones. What a hassle for evryone concerned including Amazon.
1,Cingular Network Falures,"Almost every morning I can guarantee see bars on my phone but not having the ability to dial out to anywhere, no matter where I go, and would you like to know why? It is because Cingular is having another network failure nation wide! I had T-mobile previously since its consumption in the US and I never had this problem. Before T-Mobile I used Pac-Bell/AT&T;/Cingular and I found T-mobiles prices a whole lot better.The only thing that has change w/ Cingular as of late that made me switch again is Cingular has a faster internet connection w/ Edge and 3g."
1,rip off,I purchased one of these units to get rid of cockroaches and it did nothing.I went to complain to the FTC and I found out it is illegal to make claims that these things repel insects. It said ultrasonic repellers only work on rodents.I feel cheated.
2,We still have bugs and mice,"they now hiding in the corners where they don't hear the noise. If it plugged in down low they go up to the ceiling, if i plug them in up hirer they are down low . I have six already but am debating on maybe needing three more . But why put more money out if it not working. the mice are not as bad , maybe i need more."
4,no title,I was looking for a good history of RFK. Little slow in the middle but I am glad I kept reading.
1,No stars for this copycat,"After seeing the original 1974 flesh gordon I was happy to see a part 2, I grabbed it from the rental shelf and went home hoping it would be as entertaining as the original but to my dismay part 2 was only a crude attempt to copy the first. There is no humor and no magic touch to this movie, not worth the tape it took to make it. Get the original 1974 Flesh Gordon on DVD but skip part 2. Not funny, not entertaining."
1,It's me again -- in the flesh.....,"Obviously this is a very silly movie. It ain't Oscar material, it has no redeeming value whatsoever. It's a movie to kick back and watch with tongue in cheek -- no pun intended. Most of the acting isn't, most of the effects aren't, and if they decide to make #3, they shouldn't.Given the choice again, I would have preferred to have rented this one instead of buying."
2,What a let down!,"I saw the first Flesh, and thought: ""Wow, a soft core porn comdey. Cool!"" I thought it was hilarious in its own ways. A definite change of pace from so many movies of its time. Now a sequel...WHY? Atleaset why this one. It was terrible! I agree with one of the reviewers, it was move tell than show. Their were no real sex scenes. When the 3 Cheerleaders were riding flesh, you could still see their flesh colored g-strings. Come on. And the whole turd people thing...That was just revolting....Yuck to the sequel...which didn't really even show any FLESH"
3,ITS ON THE SAME LINE AS THE FIRST ONE!,"I loved the first Flesh, but now comes a sequel thats equally grand. Evil Presence is indeed a very funny villian who had me laughing every time he spoke, Flesh himself is a little more real, and Flexi is as funny as he ever was. Some very nice set designs are also in this movie. Its an all out fun movie. I just wish they made a 3rd and 4th film......Its too late now. The series ended with the second one."
1,"The sequel, as with many, is a major disappointment.","I was disappointed in the sequel. The studio claims to have a bigger budget on this one. It didn't look like it to me. My favorite part of the first one was when the monster had Dale in his hand and pulled down her top saying, ""I just wanted to see her boobies."" It seems that the sequel is more into the ""Let's talk about it more than show it."" attitude."
1,Yuck!,"I can't believe other reviewers gave this book 4 or 5 stars. Of all the books my daughter owns this one is the worst! The story line is lame. The pictures are blurry. I do not consider this to be the quality of literature I would like my toddler exposed to. Maybe if you're a big Teletubbies fan you might like this book, but I couldn't appreciate it."
1,"Good deal, if it worked.","Bought kit prior to going on vacation, and found out DC 12V Car Adapter in kit did not work. Glad I brought my AC adapter with me ! Not worth the hassle to send back to manufacturer."
1,Kyocera Phone Car Charger,"The charger was defective (or was not capable of charging my (K9) phone, though the specs claimed otherwise). The phone case and the home charger that came in the same kit worked fine."
2,"Didn't work, not worth returning","The leather case was nice.The earpiece/microphone was very poor quality and the car recharger did not work (the cell phone connection did not seat properly and no electricity reached the phone). I threw both items away.At $10, however, it wasn't worth the time and Amazon's expense to send it back."
3,Decent Review,"I think that this is a good book, but it should focus more on test taking skills and how to answer questions. The only part where this occurs is in the sample test, but some of the answers are still confusing. The book talks a lot about what type of questions are on there, but does not go into detail about how to answer questions."
5,A radical and direct pointer to our Original Face.,"Harding shows us how to reverse the arrow of attention and, in so doing, aim directly at our true nature"
4,"Good, comprehensive; does not need any previous prepatation","This is inded a novel, bare-bones approach. The book is comprehensive as it answers several questions about the goal, and the method (or rather what we are right now, and Seeing it) However, as the book is written in a mystical style, understanding the true import can be a problem at first. Overall, I got an idea of 'Headless Living'. As the author explains, it is a non-religious approach/gate to the same hall of wisdom. While no miracles happened for me from reading the book alone, it has given new ideas, a simplistic approach, to understand the Self."
5,Easily Understood Summary for the New Christian,"I wish this book was in the hands of every new Christian. It is laid out in brief chapters, each of which can be read in a few short minutes, making it easy to put down and easy to pick up again. It doesn't go into detail on topics that Christians struggle with, but it presents the fundamentals clearly and accessibly. There are other books that help deal with tough questions better than this, but this is a great resource for basic Christian doctrine."
5,Essential Truths,Very easy to read and understand. Well written book. Presents doctrine in a format that is theologically sound and understandable for the lay theologian.
5,This Book Kicks Booty.,"There's simply not a lot of books on this topic out there. It is clear the author put a lot of time into his presentation of the material. The review above does not do this book justice - I laughed, I cried, I couldn't put it down and I'm awaiting the sequel! :-)"
3,good but not great,"I like the style of breaking SAN projects into different types and treat them differently. However, more details and technical insights are needed to honor the title ""Practical"". An article alone could fully present the content."
2,NOT SUCCESSFUL FOR ME,THE PRODUCT DIDN'T PROVIDE ME WITH DESIRED RESULTS.IT MAY WELL PROVIDE OTHERS WITH EXCELLENT RESULTS.
1,Nonsense,"Colorless, stupid, self-adoring, artless babble. Save your money. I did find the positive reviews by all the people who did not understand this book and were too afraid to admit there is nothing to understand rather entertaining. If you very much need a good belly laugh on a rainy, gloomy evening, it is awful fun to read excerpts together over wine or drinks. You will wet you paints over the pseudo intellectual crap. I should issue a warning: you may bust a gut laughing, but not for the reasons this guy intended."
1,Lousy,Don't waste your money. Too Britty and too stuck on itself to be readable. The cover is a nice color.
4,"Meet the ""black Jesus"" archetype.","This artist was fantastic, breathtaking in the way he carried himself, his music, and his life in general. He was messianic in terms of what he brought to jazz, a saving grace when jazz music languished on shelves untouched by consumer hands. He worked, baby, to rise above the strict confines of his race, striving not to be a black man, not to be a jazz artist, but to be just a man, just an artist. When drugs worked their evil hoodoo to take him out of the game, he launched a pre-emptive strike and used the time gone to fight his way up from hell.Brutally honest and outstanding to read. The last angry man, he isn't. But the last angry great man, he just might have been."
4,engrossing,"It's an understatement to call this glib, but there's a lot of interesting biographical information here (concerning musicians other than Miles too), if very little analysis. As a denizen of Saint Louis, I loved the bit about the Veiled Prophet Parade, and I laughed long and hard at Miles's cruel trick on Bill Evans--cruel of me, I know.Also recommended: PENTATONIC SCALES FOR THE JAZZ-ROCK KEYBOARDIST by Jeff Burns."
5,A superb literary work.,"This is one of the finest works to date concerning the legendary musician, Miles Davis. I actually believed that I was walking through the life of this great artist as I read this work. It is definitely well written and researched. A bargain for the price. If you did not or if you do know Miles, pick this one up. PICK THIS ONE UP!!!!!!!! IT IS A WORK FOR THE AGES!!!!!!!!"
4,A Great Memoir,"If I were to describe Miles Davis in one word it was the one he used most often in his autobiography.... Between his drinking, drug use, womanizing, and belligerent attitude, Miles Davis had an interesting life, though a rough and volatile one. His contribution to the world of jazz was great and his love for it was unmatched. Unfortunately Davis' personality resembled that of an undisciplined rock star, which in the end hindered what could have been a spectacular career; a career that might have even surpassed Satchmo himself. Nonetheless, Miles Davis was a ""cool cat,"" and his career is worth reading about. Thus, I highly recommend Miles, not just to the jazz connoisseur, but to anyone who enjoys reading about one of America's greatest artists."
4,Black and White,"This was a long book to get through, but I am glad I read it.Even though I didn't know half of the musicians he was talking to because I'm only 38 and still learning about the history of jazz/blues, I hung in there. Now I know more about those famous players from back in the day. Miles is an amazing story and life to read about.My only problem with the book was that Miles was so hung up on the Black/White racial thing that it got old listening to him rant and rage for pages at at time, especially at the end. I get where he's coming from and the age in which he grew up in but it's gets a little bit old after while. I would rather have learned more about him personally then read about all his problems with the White race. I took it was a grain of salt and you should to if you plan to undertake this massive text!Since the time period when he was writing this book A LOT has changed in this country and I wish he would have lived to see us elect a Black President. He would be proud!"
3,Good for Miles Davis fans,"After a close friend of mine bought me the classic jazz cd 'Kind of Blue' for my birthday a few years ago, I became a Miles Davis fan. This book takes you right through Miles' life and times, both the good and the bad. It is also written in Miles' language and for me this was a real capture of the man. I can't say that I agree with the foul language he consistently used though."
2,long on gossip,It's a shame to hear Miles talk about the women and drugs of his life more than his landmark recording sessions.
2,242 Pages Too Long,"MILES reads like a discography with transcribed, unedited interviews; however, a few fantastic observations manage to show up. For example:""'Bird of the Cool' became a collector's item, I think, out of a reaction to Bird and Dizzy's music. Bird and Diz play this hip, real fast thing, and if you weren't a fast listener, you couldn't catch the humor or the feeling in their music. Their musical sound wasn't sweet, and it didn't have harmonic lines that you could easily hum out on the street with your girlfriend trying to get over with a kiss. Bebop didn't have the humanity of Duke Ellington. It didn't even have that recognizable thing. Bird and Diz were great, fantastic, challenging--but they weren't sweet. But 'Birth of the Cool' was different because you could hear everything and hum it also.""MILES could have been 200 pages shorter and only focused on Davis' thoughts about music--perhaps as a musical memoir?--and it would have said a whole lot more."
2,Miles The Autobiography,I read about 25% of the text. Gave up reading any more because of the excessive use of foul language. Enough said.
1,Slow moving and profanity laden,"As much as I like Miles' music and want to learn more about him, as the title says, this book is EXTREMELY slow moving and profanity laden. If you took out the 'F' word and the 'S' word, you would reduce the size by at least half. I'm certainly no prude, but it gets tiring after a while. Sorry Miles."
1,A masterpiece in self-indulgence,"I know that Miles Davis is regarded as a legend in music. Whatever. I bought Kind of Blue and have enjoyed it OK. So then I get this autobiography as kind of a follow-up to learn more about him.I've never heard more whining from one individual in my entire life. Bitching, moaning and whining about just about everything. If he's not complaining about the white man he's telling you how he's influenced every musician you've ever heard of. It bugs me all his whining because he was priveleged and born into a fairly wealthy family. It bugs me that all he says about his sons were that they were a disapointment to him, yet he relied on his father well into his 30's. He was probably a bigger disapointment to his sons than they were to him.Maybe Miles Davis was talented, that's not for me to say. But if this book is a reflection of the man, he sures seems like a shallow, selfish, spoiled little boy."
5,Our Favorite Thanksgiving Book,"I bought this book sight unseen and it was a huge winner at our house with my two preschoolers. Pete the Turkey seems to be the dumbest turkey in town when he gets agrees to be a turkey model for the hungry townspeople around Thanksgiving...but he outsmarts everyone and escapes to the beach with his ""modeling fee"". You will chuckle and your kids will love his craftiness! The story is written in cute rhyming and the illustrations really add to the humor of the story. This is one we will keep and read over and over for years to come."
2,"Lots of new topics covered, less emphasis on the essentials","In an effort to provide the readers with the latest advances on the topic, the authors ignore the fundamentals of the LASIK procedure, wavefront physics, and the customized treatment and go in breadth over a myriad of topics that are of less importance. In addition, the book is not well structured and chapters are spread out haphazardly throughout the book, not following any logical order. The chapters themselves are not organized, lack the recapitulating tables that the previous editions had, have little references listed and most of the times no references at all. Obviously written quickly and hastily by a mercenary of authors, it doesn't live up to the hype."
4,ok,I got this for a gift and it fine but the cd player tray is slow and sometimes the tray that suppose to come out it gets stuck. but i always get it open the only thing i dont like is that bright display screen its annoying sometimes they should be a button to turn that off!
5,This cd blew me off my feet!,"WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I almost didn't buy this cd. I was a little skeptical about the title. I had never heard of Mexican Baroque (New Spain) composers. I was totally shocked, surprised, and ecstatic that I bought this cd. The very first piece by de Jerusalem was sooo beautiful that I played it over and over and over again. A fellow reviewer said that #21, the Lamentations are worth the price alone. I couldn't agree more. It is a deeply beautiful and moving peace that instantly reminds me of Gregorio Allegri's Misere Mei, Deus as well as Versa est in Luctum by Alonso Lobo (another fine peace at often times passed over) This music truly does rival Handel, Bach, and Vivaldi in terms of beauty. I am glad that I was adventerous enough to buy a cd I normally would not have even considered. BUY IT--YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!"
5,ethereal,"I agree completely with the previous reviewers, but let me add that the CD was awarded Best Classical Music recording the year it came out.It's still one of my favorites, endlessly enchanting."
5,Good read,"This is a short book about an election that changed the course of politics in America.The book is highly readable and takes account of the entire election of 1968. Gould writes an interesting piece on the primaries, conventions, and general election.While the book is not incredibly in depth it is a good introduction to the election of 1968. Defenitely worth a read as it is quite concise."
5,A great performance in a great opera house,"What can I say about a video where just about everything goes right? Under Claudio Abbado's wise baton, the Vienna Philharmonic plays Mozart's Marriage to a gleeful Vienna State Opera crowd. The cast is full of star-studded singers, most notably Cheryl Studer and Ruggero Raimondi. The dynamics are well balanced, the articulations crisp, and the chorus is actually in balance with the singers and orchestra for the first time that I can remember in an opera video.This is a great buy as Abbado and company make the vibrant Vienna State Opera House ring with the beautiful sounds that only such a house could possess. I saw this production of the Marriage of Figaro live myself at the opera house, and this video is almost a replica of the performance's quality.What a video!! Thanks Amazon!!!"
2,Barely at all good.,"This video was a big disappointment to me. The singers were good, but the rest is not good at all. I wanted this video mainly to see Ruggero Raimondi as Count Almaviva, but there were problems with his singing. He sounded very weak in this video probably because he is older in this than he is in the others that he is in. Heinz Zednik also wasn't a very good Basilio in this production. He seemed very strange, & not at all like he was as Monostatos in The Magic Flute. Most of the other characters were a little better, but there were lots of other problems in this video. Two really good arias are omitted, there is only one intermission, & to top it all off, there are no subtitles! Instead of subtitles there is a book with translations in English, German, & French that you have to stare at the whole time. I really wouldn't reccomend this video, but if you still want to pick this one, that is perfectly fine."
3,This is a BIG bag,"This is probably a great bag for the right person, but it was way to big for my needs. Sony has this listed as a bag for a huge variety of their cameras. Before you buy this, just make sure that you realize that it is actually 17"" long. You could probably fit four to six of some of the Cybershot cameras into this bag. If you are looking for something to hold a bigger Sony camera and lot of accessories, this is probably the bag for you."
3,Where are the other seasons?!,"I really liked this show. It was entertaining and touching. The girls were hot & the guys were funny, well both of them were at times. Richard was the star of the show (for this season anyway).However, I wish the other seasons would be made available. My favorite seasons, & what I've been searching for to view again are Beauty & the Geek Seasons 3, 4, & 5. Season 4 was my favorite, & I liked how Season 3 lead into Season 4 w/ the use of past contestants. Of the three I mentioned, Season 5 was my least favorite, although I believe the 2nd season was probably the weakest of the show."
3,Bumbling bimbos,"Geeks! If a girl can't cook or take out a T-888 Terminator Destroyer, don't call back!Can anyone tell to what extent this reality TV series is real or if everyone is just acting for the cameras and a paying audience? A social experiment on air it may be, it can be watched as plain entertainment if only for a quick laugh.The girls in this entire series think they're so hot but they're not!At most, their looks won't last another 10 years after wear and tear.I don't like the way some of them made disparaging remarks on the geeks.Not cool at all!No serious man should waste any time on girls like these in real life!Girls like these usually end up as serial divorcees not knowing where to go or what they want in life, and usually end up marrying men who abuse them 24/7. They don't need rescuing. They need a real education, much more than a GED cert.Geeks! Getting those academic titles behind your name is much more important than dating bimbos."
3,"Okay movie, was slightly disappointed","Overall, I felt that this movie was just okay for me. I expected a whole lot more. The acting and set-up was low-budget and the plot made entirely NO sense. I definitely would not recommend purchasing this movie. Put your money to better use!"
1,$2:00 movie,"the pictue quality was good, the movie was not all that bad however it's not worth the price to buy it. $2.00 is all it's worth"
1,Save yourself and your money...,"The acting is terrible and the plot is jerky and disconnected; don't waste your money or your time - the ""surprise"" at the end is not worth it. Remember I told you."
1,Oh what a H.A.M.,"The title of this review is not a reference to the actor's performances. It is an acronym for a hot @zz mess. That pretty much sums up the whole film from start to finish. I watched this with my friend and we were on the floor laughing the whole time at this blunder. The bad editing and writing, horrific acting, and awkward camera angles will have you in stitches. In one shot, it looked like they switched from film to video. Don't get me wrong I knew this film was low budget but come on they could have done better. It seemed as if they had a budget of $20.00 and half of that looked like it was spent on the food. And Robin Givens, sweety, are times really this hard? I would have given you the money to pay your master card bill for the month. To sum up, this movie was a hot lava filled mess"
1,not so happy,this movie was a big disappointment. This is movie sucked bad. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
1,"STUPID,CRAZY,SHiT !!!","This movie ""Restraining Order,was a Stupid ASS movie, I ever purchased and i Hate i ever, that's how much i wished i never brougt this movie. THIS was silly and i got so Damm lost in this movie. i told myself that maybe as the movie plays it will get better, but on the other hand i was Dead wrong.I was lost and lost in the movie AT TIMES. I really did not understand this stupid movie.I hate, I purchase this one.I will give the movie to a family member and to see if they may like it because I sure in Hell don't...I WILL JUST BE HONEST, I REALLY DON'T LIKE THIS MOVIE AT ALL, AND MAYBE SOMEONE ELSE WILL LIKE IT AND BUY IT, BUT ON THE OTHER HAND I DON'T LIKE THE MOVIE.."
3,Not a Bad Movie Seen worst,"The story line was good, Robin Givens acting was awful, I was really suprise. Over all it was an OK movie."
3,Crazy Movie,This movie is ok for the budget. Some things didn't make sense though. This guy went crazy and it was her fault. In the end she is regretful but he loses everything. They should have had a better actor for the main lawyer although I like him in other things. Robin's lawer has to work on his acting skills. It's cool for something to watch though.
3,From a DV survivor,I think it made a statement. Just because a woman tells you she is being abused does not mean it is true.
5,Metro : A Novel of the Moscow Underground,"Long before Alex Garland wrote ""The Beach"" Alexander Kaletski came up with this little piece of modest art. Kaletski's book is all about life with all it's glory, misery, pain, absurdity, weirdness, destiny, love, fun and happiness. As no other he describes these themes is a simple, human language without beating around the bush. It's no James Joyce or Umberto Eco, but as Garland he wrote a page turner that gives you the urge to continue reading but at the same time overwhelms you with the fear of the moment that you'll have to close the book knowing that there is no good enough alternative after this one to please your literal mind... I'm all about saving the rain forest and stop tearing down a lot of trees for the junk on paper that you get in your mailbox or see in bookshops regularly, but getting this one printed again is no waste of trees."
1,"Self-indulgence galore, bad writing to boot...","This book was just awful. I liked the writer's first book, The Kafka Chronicles, but this one just didn't cut it. It tries to be a novel and fails. It tries to be hip and fails. It tries to be shocking and fails. It tries to be clever and fails. And the cover is not appealing with the transexual playing a guitar. It's no wonder this author hasn't published another book since 1996."
1,doesn't look nice on finger,I bought two of these as bff rings because I love the statement inside. But I was hoping it would be fashionable but its quite ugly. Also the letters fall out even though you can still see the engraved words.
5,We love them,"I ordered two of these. One for myself and one for my husband to replace our much battered stirling silver bands.They are much nicer than picture and they fit great.They look great and are much wider than picture seems.Would buy them again.Lightning, free ship, nice boxes and velvet pouch.A whole lot of good stuff for a very low price.Janet BakerBenwood, WV"
3,just average,"The ring isn't quite as beautiful as in the picture, but otherwise meeats the characteristics of a typical steel ring. The writing inside is etched in and filled with some sort of black ink. The black will come off. The etching stays - you just can't read it as well."
4,Like the rest have said....,"...picture quality notwithstanding, this is a must own set. I'm a film noir fanatic, so if WB (and most other companies) keeps releasing them, I'll continue to buy them up."
4,"Excellent CD, no liner notes :(","To the best of my knowledge this 2 CD set of the Brahms string quartets done by the Alban Berg Quartett is of the finest currently available. The players show a balance and timbre that is gorgeous and sumptuous without being overbearing. True panache and class are quite radiant in this recording. For the virtuosic playing it's worth the very reasonable price.My only reason for a 4-star rating is that the CD set comes without liner notes: a very minor thing when just taking the time to enjoy the music. But for some of us who feel that they need a little background info as to what was going on in the composer's life or perhaps his actual reason for writing the music, it is completely lacking.Like I said though, it's worth the money you spend for it and I still highly recommend it. You'll just have to find another source to retrieve background info.Now if only Sony would re-release the Juilliard Quartet performing these same string quartets."
4,The Da Vinci Code Board Game In a Tin,This game is fun and challenging. puzzles to solve and riddles to crack! The setup is quick but the directions are long but simple to follow. I think it's worth a try for the price. Not for kids but would be good for a dinner party or a gathering of intellectual friends.
1,Basin Wrench Large Jaw,"The manufacturer failed to install a spring in the large jaw making the tool useless. I returned 1st tool for replacement. I included explaination for returning the tool and talked with a service representative. The replacement tool arrived within two days (Excellent response), unfortunately it had the same defect, no spring in the large jaw. I again contacted the customer service desk and advised them of the problem. The service representative said she would have the product pulled from the the availability list.I solved my need for the wrench.I was pleased with the response from Amazon.Lasco 13-2029 Metal 16-Inch Basin Wrench, Large Jaw for Faucet Installation"
5,The Sacred Way: Spiritual Practices for Everyday Life,"As a clergy person, it is great to have Tony write a book that reminds me of the great spiritaul practices from the early church that I can do today. The way Tony wrote this book allows me to teach others about such things that will deepen their walk with the Holy.Great job Tony. The Scared Way is must need book for clergy and lay folks alike."
3,"Everything from a ""home run"" to an absolute ""strikeout"" in this one!","This review will be a little schitsophrinic. When I buy a book I usually assume that the author wouldn't be writing it and the publishing house wouldn't be publishing it unless the author knew a great deal about the subject matter. Well, in The Sacred Way you can't make that assumption. Evan's chapters are mixed with subjects that he obviously knows a great deal about (stations of the cross), those he knows a little about (silence & solitude) and those he knows almost nothing about (fasting). One moment I find myself saying, ""Wow, Tony, you did such a great job. I am blessed."" The next moment, ""What in the world were you thinking; writing about something of which you obviously know so little."" So I gave it a 3. When you average a ""0"" and a ""5"" you get 2.5. I was always taught to round the number up, so that comes to a ""3"". God bless. Mike"
2,Getting the correct size is a real problem,"These fins run super small. I wear size 15 shoes and tried the 15-17 size fins. I took everything i had to get them on. My feet swelled up after i took them off. That was the last time for that, so i bought a different brand and they fit. These seem to be made very well and are a good price. They are just too small."
5,Great fins! Don't hesitate!,"I bought these fins for my kids and have given them as gifts. They are perfect for kids at the pool or beach. I find that they are reasonably good quality and fit true to size. There is a range covering 3 sizes for each pair, but seems to work - my kids are a 12 and a 1 and both are using the 11-1 sizing; if you are on the cusp, I would order down. By the way, when we gave this as a gift, the girl said it was the best bday present she got! Yay!"
4,Good first Blu Ray from Yash Raj,This is a good quality first Blu Ray from Yash Raj. Image and sound quality are up to snuff. As it should be with brand new films that had a digital intermediate which is the source for this BD. 2 negative points are present nonetheless:- Yash Raj logo superimposed for some seconds at the start of songs. Unnecessary and annoying. Logos don't belong on Blu Rays!- No subtitles for supplements so some Hindi sections are incomprehensible if you don't speak HindiA good first effort worth a purchase if you like the film.
3,And breakfast is already made . . .,"Terry Saltz has made a hash of his life, and he's starting all over again. He's a carpenter, trying to build his business back up after getting out of jail. He's clean and sober, and has found a day job as a pizza delivery guy. When one of the other pizza delivery guys is killer, Terry and his new-found pals decide they can find the killer better than the police can. What mystery reader hasn't been down this road before?Fawkes has written a decent mid-list mystery. Terry has his problems, and he's working on them, some days better than others. The writing won't strain most people's vocabularies, the setting is lower middle-class (at best), and COLD SLICE is worth the time spent reading it. I'm looking forward to reading more in the series."
4,Mexican classic,"one of my favorite classic Mexican movies ever. I was in love with Pedro Fernandez as a kid and to be able to buy it as an adult and share the same love for this movie with my daughter is amazing. The songs are incredibly well sang by him and the movie is very endearing. The quality of the dvd is okay, but its to be expected for a movie to be filmed in the 80's."
4,Excellent work,"For a mid book in a series, this book moves along well, tells a real story and develops the overall theme sharply. Nothing moves too slow or too quickly, and none of the interactions is forced."
4,Exciting,"I loved the story, kept me interested throughout. Wells is a good author who has a good idea how to keep the reader turning the pages. I hope there will be more from her as I look foward to experiencing more of what she has to offer.Another book readers of Ships of Air would possibly like is The Unsuspecting Mage by Brian S. Pratt. Slightly different from hers, still not too bad."
5,This is an extraordinary resource for family business owners,"Jane Hilburt-Davis and Gibb Dyer have made a significant contribution to the emerging field of family business consultation. They deliver good practical advice along with thoughtful insight about the pushes and pulls that families feel as their companies grow and thrive. In the short time I've owned this book I've had to move it closer and closer to the ""most used"" section on my book shelf. Clearly these authors do hands-on consultation everyday, know what they're doing, but have also thought about how to share their ideas with family business owners and other consultants. 'Very readable. It's just a great resource."
5,This is the best recording of the 5th out on the market!,"This recording is the definitive of Prokofiev's fifth symphony. As for the Romeo and Juliet EXCERPTS. That is exactly what they are. If you're looking for a more complete recording of the excerpts, You might try the San Francisco Symphony recording with Tilson Tomas. Even so, I've never heard a better performance of the Montegues and Capulates. The low brass were captured in all of their glory and the rest of the winds are very present as well. This recording is a great buy for any cd library and a welcome one to mine. Definately worth the money."
3,The Symphony is great; the Romeo & Juliet isn't,"This recording of Prokofiev's fifth symphony is a wonderful demonstration of the Philharmonic's powerful brass. The recording itself is slightly less intense than many others, but it has a character all its own. The Romeo & Juliet has its moments, but in general it is quite sloppy for a studio recording. One looking for a wonderful recording of this music could easily do better. The strange thing about this CD is that the symphony is a LIVE recording, and it is nonetheless much better TECHNICALLY than the R & J suite!! I would buy this CD for the symphony, and try to find a better recording of Romeo."
1,Not much fun,"Wii was Xmas present, so haven't used it long, but loved Wii Fit and Wii Sports. I did a bit of research and read that this one gets you up and moving. I assumed that meant like Wii Sports. WRONG. The controls are difficult to operate and there are no instructions. Have to choose your character (or Mii) for EVERY event. Then to suffer through the ""awards"" while hitting the A button to try to cut it short. Three adults played for 2 days, with newly purchased additional nunchucks and controllers ($$$!!) and realized...it's not us. Rent this game first. We should have."
2,Burning forearms,"This game gives your arms cramps rather quickly because you are constantly moving the remote/nunchuk in repetitive movements to make your character run, throw something, run and jump. Every sport is a new challenging move, but it's still pretty lame to me. It's great if you like a quick game, and I mean quick... and you like to try and try again."
1,"My 7 year old thinks it's ""easy""","My son got this game today and within 1 hour was disappointed b/c he was not challenged. As opposed to Mario Supersluggers which he finds challenging, he thought this was only so-so, and so the review is not high. He does add that it may be more fun with multiple people, however, we've not had time to play with him...."
1,This game sucks,"This game is boring, stupid, pointless and has the worst controls ever. I would recommened renting this one if you think you must play it because it's just a total waste of money."
3,Disappointing,"I found this game disappointing. The controls are awkward. For example if you want to compete in a running race you have to move both the wii mote and nunchuk up and down really fast which isn't like running at all and after a while hurts your arms.I think they are trying to replicate wii sports but the controls in this are way more complicated than wii sports which kind of detracts from the fun of the game.Also, I would not say its a good one player game. You should play it at a party, but I'd reccomend mario party 8 before this game for a party.Basically, rent this game if your having a party and save your money for mario galaxy or something."
5,Excellent game for all ages!,This game has several games in one and is easy to follow by everyone in my family. You will only need the Wii remote and nunchuk accessories to play. It is excellent fun for everyone.
2,Really wanted to love it,"I bought this game for my daughter and I. We love playing the Wii together (we love Wii Sports, Carnival Games, Mario Party 8). I find myself not believing that this game was just terrible for us. It was boring, hard to figure out the controls (which rarely seemed to work well...leaving you frustrated), and either very hard or very easy. The fact you have to re-do who you ""are"" everytime you change games is awful. Plus waiting for all the scenes for the winner--UGH!It offered us no workout at all--unlike Wii Sports--unless we stayed with the same sport. If we wanted to change it seemed to take forever to do something else. After about 3 hours we gave up. I returned this (luckily I bought it used). Maybe this is a fun adult party game with a bunch of friends and a 6 pack or something..but for my daughter and I we just can't recommend."
2,I expected better.,"It is not really that exciting. A few of the games are interesting, but most of the games lack the subtlety of real sports. The fencing is awful, two dimensional, and the only thing that really resembles fencing is the name. The table tennis was the worst I had played yet. The shooting game could have been cool, but the little pre-game timing exercise kills it.The track and field games are fun, but they don't make up for the other content.If you are thinking of buying this game, rent it first you may end up saving a few bucks."
2,Not great,"Rented this game for about a week...the visuals are good, the game play in general is pretty fun, but the biggest problem is that the game doesn't tell you what you did wrong very well. Like when you go to do the triple jump there's no way to tell how close you are to the line to make your first jump...so inevitably you're not going to be very close when you jump. Oh, and if you miss something, it doesn't say, ""you were early"" or ""you were late"" or anything, it just says FOUL. It's quite frustrating. Plus, you can't just go from one event to another with the same character, you have to basically start the whole process of character selection over every time you want to play in a new event."
4,"Awesome game, loads of fun!","I really enjoyed this game. Finally, 2 of the biggest video game personnas of the 90's duke it out! I really enjoyed the multiplayer mode for this game... and single player is fun too. Swimming and shooting seem to be my events, and despite being in great shape, I managed to break a sweat! Lots of fun, great characters, plenty of replay value. The ONLY drawback... you guessed it... whose brain-child was it to not include online play? Whoever you are, you blew it! This game would be so cool to play via Nintendo WFC. Despite this seeming oversight, great all around game. See you on the leader boards! (Or maybe not... in my case)"
2,Too awkward for family fun,I am really disappointed in the controls and difficulty level of the game. The running and swimming events are almost impossible to beat the computer. Fencing controls are unnatural. PLEASE RENT FIRST ... you will know within 15 minutes if you would like to purchase a copy. Back to playing Wii Sports and Mario Party.
4,Lots of fun - hard to play for long periods of time..,"love this game - tons of fun for my wife and I (and she doesn't like video games). we even invite friends over, just to play this and Mario Cart. my biggest complaint with this game, and it's really a complaint about the technology of the system, is that you just can't play it for long periods of time. this game is a total work out!otherwise, lots of fun sports to play - we love the trampoline i think the best.. graphics are great. love the fact that your Mii's have legs and look like they belong - although the spandex outfits area little disturbing (in and good way). all in all, a great game and a great buy."
4,i really like it,"Thos game is really neat, its a little complecated at first until you get the hang of it. My son is 5 and at the biggining he was a little frustrated because like a told you is a little bit tricki, but know he love it!! And i do to..."
4,Good party game,This is a great game to play with a group of people. Lots of fun events to keep you entertained for hours on end. Only downside is that you have to unlock alot of events in the beginning.
3,Nice game for kids.,At the beginning is a little hard to play but then you have the practice it gets better.
3,easy - a bit too easy,"I was excited about this title because of the great Olympic video games I played as a kid. Mario & Sonic is fun and easy, but doesn't quite live up to my expectations. Many of the events involve mostly drumming the controllers as rapidly as possible, with a few button presses thrown in for other actions. This gets repetitive and tiring quickly. The best events are those involving more strategy, timing, or skill. I like archery, table tennis, and trampoline the best. The events are all quite easy. Both me and my 8-year old could beat the computer players in almost every event on the first or second try, and world records are also fairly easy to break. The best use of the game is when you have 2-4 people playing together; it's just not that fun by yourself."
5,Great video game.,This was a gift for my grandson. I wanted something I knew he would enjoy for many hours. Very age appropriate
2,not what I hoped for,Skeet shooting is something I was excited about but it is not very good to use as practice for the real thing.
5,"very tiring, but it's an awesome game",This is one of my favorite wii games. Its a lot of fun and is great exercise for your arms. Ignore the negative reviews and buy the game.
3,Great game but...,I enjoy this game but sometimes the complexity of the movements gets me down. Boy a lot of people will be visiting the doctor with carpal tunnel syndrome because of the constant movement for long periods of time. I can only play for an hour without the pain in my hands.
3,"Meh. I like the mixture, but still...","The two biggest video game characters and their friends face off in a worldwide known event: The olympics!Pole vault, hammer throw, you name it. It's here. There's even some bizarre Dream events that will really weird you out.I don't know how to describle this.... There's so much to describe. I'll just say that it is fun, but it gets boring fast.,PROS:Good graphicsGood physicsFun, but boring-quick eventsCustimization tourneyThe Gallery and its minigamesCONSIt gets boring fastInstead of going into a final duel if two people tie, the FIRST PLAYER takes first placeThe sheer lack of Toad being a playable characterThe weirdness of Dream events (Minus the Skydiving)Game slows down when the screen fills upNo story....Toad, it's time for thhe............He knew. Anyway, it gets rated 3/5, because I can't think of any refences."
2,Try it before you buy it!!,This game could have been made way better. Im consistantly switching from the wii remote to the nunchuck and back and forth. A few of the games take time to get use to how to do them. Then the fact that your score doesn't show against your other wii's is disappointing...and you can't win at swimming at all that one was so confusing. Everyone told me it was so much fun so I bought it without trying it...TRY IT!!! I would have bought mario kart instead!!
4,Great Game!,"I bought this game for my son and we all played it on Christmas Day. It was great fun and required a lot of physical effort - not for couch potatoes! There's a lot of variety and it's fun for individuals as well as teams. If you like competition, this game's for you."
5,Lots of Fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This is a great game that I have been waiting for. Playing with multiple players will work best. The track & field area is the only one I have played multiple times. If it was the entire game it would still be great.
2,Ehh.. only alright,"This game is slow to load, and it takes you through to many screens before you can just play. the games are good though, I wish they cut out a lot of the fluff... The award ceremonies take forever..."
3,"Fun, but no story","Up Side: This game is fun, and I think being able to play as different characters in different events makes the format attractive. Down side: After a few times playing, I got tired of the game. There is no story to the game. You just select to play events. I think the game would be more engaging if there was an option for a story mode."
4,Lots of Fun with my Son...,"Purchased this because my 8 year-old son wanted it and he got me to play with him. It's sooooo much fun! We've had a great time playing the games provided and unlocking new ones. Only wish there was a way to practice some of the games rather than always being in competition. Oh well..., I guess I have to remember it's not like Madden and other EA Sports games. Well worth the money though!"
3,overall disappointing,"This game is a great concept with great graphics, but it's way too challenging for the kids. I have an eight year old, and the game is way too hard for him, so he grew bored with this fast."
5,Great fun for the whole family.,"I gave this to my grandsons, 9 and 4, at Thanksgiving. They both had the greatest time playing with this game. The rest of the family enjoyed watching them participate in all the events. The four year old wasn't as adept as the nine year old but he held his own and had fun."
3,desent game,I do enjoy this game but I could do without the award ceromonies and it could use some training options.
5,"Great game to play by self, with family, or friends.","I have had this for a few months now. It's a great game whether you are by yourself, have friends over, or playing with family. Great game for all ages. I recently took this game while on a family vacation and it was a hit with all ages (12-75). The multiple events is almost like having a different game. Great selection of games initially, and more are available when you hit certain milestones."
1,A Bad Mario Party with Sonic,This game tries to hard to be Mario Party. The controls are bad and the mini-games are not interesting. The first crossover between former rivals turns out to be a suck-fest.
1,Are these other reviewers joking???,"This game is terrible, its boring, uninteresting and has no replay value. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!! If you want mini games look at the mario party series. I'm disappointed i spent $7 on the rental."
2,kind of boring,not very fun at all. We were excited to get this game but I'd rather play Wii sports any day.
1,Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games.,I have two super mario fans & for the 1st time they said they don't like it soI had to try it & I think the game is frustrating..not my kinda game.. I rather play other sports Wii games.
2,Well...,"I was searching for Mario/Sonic at the 2012 London summer olympics. I got some of those, but this one was the Beijing olympics. I should have read more carefully, obviously. But it was very disappointing to open the package and discover this mistake. I don't like it when the search function takes me away from my actual search. Buyer beware, I know. But it feels a bit like I was cheated."
3,Sonic's Pathetic Attempt to Compete with Mario,"Sonic couldn't really beat Mario at anything, except a race, but that's beside the point. Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games is a fun game thought up by Nintendo and Sega. It's fun to play in a wide variety of Olympic events, but unfortunately there aren't too many events to unlock, which hurts the replay value a little. Still, this game is worth more of a buy than a rent.Presentation- 91/100Graphics- 70.5/100Sound- 70/100Gameplay- 75/100Replay Value- 67/100Overall- 73/100"
3,"Not Wii-like, more like button mashing","Yes, you do use the motion-sensitive aspects of the Wii controller, but in often in a non-intuitive way. Unlike Wii Sports, where you feel like you're playing the sport, this game feels like games on other platforms where you mash buttons really fast or in a certain order or timing to get ahead. For example, the trampoline event did require you to wave the controller up and down to jump higher, but then to do tricks you had to do a series of button presses/controller twists. In fencing you do push the controller forward to lunge, but parrying requires pressing the A button in addition to a sideways wave, feinting requires B button instead of a feint with controller. Other events just require moving the controller/nunchuk up and down really fast.This isn't a bad game, it's just that it is much like all the other Olympic games that have come out for PS/2, GameCube, etc., and just doesn't feel Wii-like."
3,ok same as most wii games,"Graphics are better for this game. But it's the same game done for Wii over and over. You shake the remote in different ways for the mini games. As with most Wii games so far it doesn't fully use the motion sensors the way you think it would. It's a good game for families or children. For people in their 20's or 30's it lacks skill, strategy, or thought."
3,Ok but not as good as wii sports.,When i got this game i got it because i love mario and sports but i dont like sonic. So i thought that i could be the mario series and i would beat the sonic series. It was kind of fun at first but then it gets boring especially by ur self. It is much more fun with other people. The controls r kind of hard to use and it is dumb when u r playing pin pong and u keep missing. The only thing i like is the shooting and running. This game is not very fun and most of the events r to hard or is not realistic at all.
3,Got old quick and controls are sketchy,We rarely play this any more and the novelty wore off after like a week.
2,Poor planning on Nintendo's part...,"Since ancient times the Olympics have been about competition. For whatever reason when you play with more than one player in Mario & Sonic it will not save records or medals awarded. IE, if you win a gold and set a new world records in sculling with two or more people playing at once, none of these scores will be recorded. So much for competition... Competition brings the best out in people and Nintendo failed to realize this which destroys a lot of the fun in competing and suceeding..Not to mention no Wifi play, just uploading scores which is nice but these can only be viewed from the game itself. There is no way to check your scoring as in Guitar Hero... Save your money and buy the DS version of this, at least you expect that on a smaller more inexpensive version of the game."
4,Fun competition,I bought this game as a gift for my boyfriend who is 20. i wasnt sure if hed like it but once we played together it is his new favorite wii game. he recommends it to his friends and talks about it very highly. The image quality was very good and The games are kind of hard to figure out at first you should read the instructions for each game. It was a fun competitive game and is more based on timing then anything else. Very fun and can play for hours.
4,If you like Mario and Sonic.........,"This is a pretty fun game. It has 20 + games and some more mini games. Very colorful to look at. Some games are harder than they should be but I suppose that is better than being too easy. We do wish they would have allowed you to choose difficulty levels. Most of the games require a good amount of fast movement with the controller(s), which we like. A child younger than, say, eight will probably get frustrated at times with what they have to do to win some events, and some may not be doable for them. No regrets buying this one........just so much to choose from!"
3,A bit of a disappointment,"My 12-year-old son had high hopes for this game. Mario and Sonic together: What could be cooler? Unfortunately, he found the game play pretty boring and after a few days this ended up on the shelf with other games that don't get played much anymore. My son's exact words: ""It just wasn't as much fun as I hoped it would be."""
4,Super Mario super for younger kids on WII,"My grandsons love it! Ages 6-9. I had worried that some of the WII games were for older kids, but they really aren't. Mario is a good game and we use it for play when they need rewards for good deeds and good behavior."
2,Barely Soviet,"This record was not exactly what I hoped for. Only the first part of the songs (the civil war) contains some pieces sung by a huge choir. The rest is performed by small ensembles, which doesn't match with the impression you get of the record's title, namely ""Soviet power"" music. In addition, the quality of the sound is very poor (and in mono of course)."
5,"Winter Grief, Summer Grace","This little book was given to me about 2 months after my husband died 10 years ago. It is tremendously helpful in coming to grips with grief. Although there are some spiritual passages, it is not a religious book. It focuses your thinking, as well as citing some positive things things to do. Over this decade I have given away many, many copies to grieving friends. It is always most welcome and appreciated."
5,Very sweet,"After losing my mom and then my dad two years later, this book was given to me from a friend. It has touched my heart in a very significant way - I highly recommend it to anyone who is walking through the loss of a loved one."
1,Regulatory cost recovery fee,"I have to return the product within 2 weeks because Amazon didn't disclose to me that I am not elligible to buy that Cingular product. I was a Cingular customer, just finished contract with them. As per Cingular I can not buy another Cingular product from 3rd party vendor within 90 days after signing off from Cingular. Amazon sent me the product after being approved by Cingular(!) & latter disclosed I have to pay in full without any discount if I want to keep the product. That was very embarrasing & big hassle for me. I have to spent hours & hours with Amazon & Cingular to straighten it up! I wish it never happens to me or anyopne again. Tanks gor asking."
1,regulatory,I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY I HAVE TO PAY REGULATORY COST RECOVERY WHAT DID ALL THE TAXES PAY FOR
1,"First I Was All Like ""Yeah!"" Then I Was All Like ""What?""","I happened to stumble across this Regulatory Cost Recovery Fee purely by chance a few weeks ago and boy was I excited! I mean, one minute I'm browsing Amazon looking for a replacement colostomy bag (I like the ones with Hello Kitty on them but sometimes have to settle for stupid Miffy) and the next thing I come across this awesome buy on Regulatory Cost Recovery Fees! Naturally I forewent the bag and tried to add the Regulatory Cost Recovery Fee to my cart instead. Well, you can imagine how quickly my elatement turned to disappointment when I was told that the Regulatory Cost Recovery Fee was currently out of stock! How can that be? How much room can a Regulatory Cost Recovery Fee possibly occupy in Amazon's warehouse? Of course they have no estimate on when they'll be back in stock either. I guess I'm gonna have to go back to getting my Regulatory Cost Recovery Fees on the outside."
1,Government thievery!,"More theft of your tax dollars by the government! Yeah, they made it legal to take your money so they could give away cell phones to ""certain"" people! Pathetic!"
1,THEFT. Simple THEFT.,"Why do they have to add an extra fee in addition to the plan that you agree to pay for. Why can they not just add it to the cost of the plan instead of giving it a stupid name and making it mandatory. One-dollar-twenty-five cents is what they need to run the company. Right.What the hell is a ""Regulatory Cost Recovery Fee"" anyway? Any taxes are charged in addition to whatever the bill is.This is exactly why these cellular providers need to be tightly regulated.Cingular can do without me."
1,Stupid,"Fees, Fees, and more fees. Telecommunications are taxed higher than many income brackets. This is getting out of hand."
2,Dear Rodolfo,"My friend likes the same guy I do, and she wants to ask him out. I'm pretty sure he's going to ask me out, because he was acting really nice around me on Friday--and I was one of the only people he was paying attention to. I've had a feeling that he really likes me since last year. The only problem is: I don't think my friend realizes it, because she didn't know me well last year. If he does ask me out, I don't want to hurt my friend's feelings by saying yes. But I don't want to hurt my own feelings by saying no! (Or his since he's a really good friend.) What should I do?"
1,ridiculous scam,"all of these fees they charge us, subscribers, are draining our finances. we should put a stop on all of these excessive, ridiculous ways of money laundering. this is one form of a legal hoax."
1,Regulatory Rip-Off Fee!,"This is just another way for corporations to squeeze the consumer. Regulatory Cost Recovery, my aching back!! This is merely another cost of doing business that is being passed on to users. What's going to be next, an Employee Salary Recovery Fee? This fee, while ""only"" $2.50 per month, almost made me reconsider signing up with Cingular (Verizon, my last service, didn't charge this fee.) Bogus!"
1,Fees Suck,"HOw could anyone like a fee that simply amounts to increased product cost that the producer disguises as a ""fee"". Why don't they start adding labor cost overhead fees, capital expenditure cost fees, misc. product expense fee, etc..etc..etc...you get my point. With all those fees they could give the products away and still make a PROFIT!!!!!"
1,Dont waste your time and money,This product is not worth the time you have already spent reading this review. Get a shaver you will be happy with like Brawn and thats for any hear type.
5,Great Learning Tool,"I bought the Fisher Price learn through music but, I dont have this particular cartridge.I just wanted to write a review to clear up that this is not a bad product in fact its a great one, Im sure all the cartridges are great, I have the Dora Explorer one,as well as the Sesame Street one they are both very educational and fun for my 27month old. He has had it since he was a year old. He still loves it. If your unsure of what you are buying call and ask someone."
1,You can't buy this piece alone,Nowhere in this web page does it tell you that this product is a cartridge for a home base product that is sold separately. The product is useless without the main Sesame Street learn and play system. Make sure you have the base system before you buy.
1,Bad description,"As a previous reviewer stated, the description does not say that it is an accessory. I was embarassed that I shipped this as a gift and the child was unable to use because you needed another piece. I am very disappointed."
2,The 2008 Edition is outdated - get the Brandt,"As Bangladesh is a developing country, things are changing fast - especially with regards to tourism. The research for this edition of the guide (6th Edition, published 2008) was completed in 2007, and a lot has changed in the past three to four years. Hopefully, Lonely Planet will update this edition and add more, current listings. As there are not many guides for Bangladesh in the first place, I bought both the Lonely Planet and the Brandt guides, and ended up replying almost exclusively on the Brandt guide, which is more up-to-date. Generally, I've had very good experiences with Lonely Planet guides, but Bangladesh is definitely and exception (and a place where a good guide would be particularly useful).Bangladesh (Bradt Travel Guide)"
3,Travel Guide Review,"The used product was in very good condition. It has the basic information but the guide does not go into a lot of detail on anything. I use Lonely Planet Guidebooks often and they are usually adequate. This one is OK for my short trip but if I needed more information, I would look for a more complete guide.Amazon's service was good. The price is reasonable, book in very good condition, and it was received as promised."
3,A bit of a disappointment,"I'm a big fan of the alt-folk-country genre (Steve Earle, Lucinda Williams, Wilco, etc.), and I have previously liked some of Rodney Crowell's CDs (although he's not my favorite) and this CD had some rave reviews. I heard a feature on this CD on NPR and thought I'd love it. I like it OK, but it really didn't have the emotional element necessary to make great music. It rarely makes it into my CD player."
3,What's the big deal with this one?,"I was kind of disapointed with this release. It tends to be generic. I prefer the sound he mastered on ""Diamonds & Dirt"" and ""Jewel of the South."" Beware of this one. Seek out his older stuff first. How about an acousic cd and a reissue of his first records on Warner Brothers"
5,"Rodney bares his soul eloquently, a masterpiece","As a fan since I first heard ""Ain't Livin' Long Like This"" this album has got to be considered his best. Rodney has matured as an artist and especially a songwriter. The album exposes Crowell's ""topsy turvy"" upbringing and includes tasty fills by master guitarist and longtime friend Stuart Smith. ""I Know Love is All I Need"" strikes a chord with anyone who has lost their parents, ""I Walk The LIne (Revisited)"" is simply the best Johnny Cash tribute ever, and ""Telephone Road"" captures a lost place and time whiles it rocks your socks off! Don't miss this one..."
4,"""The Houston Kid"" Gets Serious","In his newest CD, The Houston Kid, Rodney Crowell provides an entertaining and touching glimpse into a family of Texas musicians in the middle of the last century. These clean well-crafted songs blend a folk sensibility with an alt-country edge. Cowell, who's production credits include Willie Nelson and who's ex-wife credits include Rosanne Cash, shows he's as talented in front of the mic, as behind the mixing board. These are songs written by a man who grew up in honkey tonks and sound great while sawing off parking meters."
5,Rodney's Best!,"This autobiographical work is Rodney's masterpiece! Rodney brings memories of his not always happy childhood to this CD. Songs like Topsy Turvey, Rock Of My Soul explore spousal abuse and the effect it has on a family. There are also songs like I Walk the Line (revisted) which tells the story about how young Rodney first heard Johnny Cash. The lighthearted Bank's of the Old Bandera and Telephone Road bring to mind glimpses of my own childhood. The album ends on a happy note with the positive reinforcement of I know Love Is All I Need. This CD is like being on an emotional roller coaster and I'm glad to be along for the ride!!"
5,Rodney Crowells Ultimate Work Of Art,"This album is art in it's truest form as it digs deep into the heart,the mind, the soul and the memories of the artist. I've always marveled at how Rodney could see into my soul and write just what I needed to hear. This time Rodney has looked into his own soul and wrote what he needed to hear. This album is full of fun,love,memories,understanding and forgiveness. There is something in here for all of us. The lyrics, melodies, arrangements and production are the best of anything Rodney has ever done. I have had this cd stuck in my player for over 2 months, and can't take it out, anything else I try to listen to is bland and lifeless in comparison. I can't get past being excited about this collection and only wonder, Rodney, how can you ever top this?"
3,Organized but bulky,This helped me organize my credit cards so that I can actually close my wallet but this is very bulky if you fill up the slots (one credit card per slot). My mom has another kind with transparent vinyl sleeves which holds more cards and is not as bulky either. The vinyl sleeves ripped after a few years but she got those from a street vendor for a dollar or two so it was a good deal. I would have gone with that next time.
4,Morris is a provocative writer,"I am glad, very glad to find this book on Amazon. I wanted to assign ""No Words"" to my deconstruction class as one of several books for extra credit, but i could not find it at my local book store (i like to support the home-growns when i can).Excellent book. Great Canadian novelist. She looses a star since we lost her to the U.S."
1,Not for combo or oily skin,"This cream contains oils that can clog pores. People with combination and oily skin should avoid it.I have a combination skin, so I was not able to use it, because I don't want to have acne."
1,Does not play ANY mp3 files,"I bought the RCD148 yesterday only because it claimed it could play mp3 files. I inserted some CD-R's which had perfectly good mp3 files on them. But this boombox never recognized or played any of these mp3 files. It always interpreted the CD-R's wrongly as audio CD's.Well, I thought let's try the MusicMatch software they ship with the box. Maybe it does something special. I did that, experimented with different discs (CD-R, CD-RW), finalizing the disc, etc. I also tried to burn a 100%-ISO-conform CD-R with Nero and the Windows XP built-in burn software. Nothing worked!I was even checking out the RCA website if there was any support information or firmware updates. Nothing.You will also not find any customer service phone number in the user's manual.I am going to return this product immediately.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! IT DOES NOT PLAY MP3 FILES!"
1,Keep your receipt handy!,"I bought and returned this within 24 hours. After setting it up I tried to play a simple audio CD and it spun up and displayed the number of tracks and the total playing time, but when I pushed play the display would read ""serching track"" for several minutes before I realized the disc had stopped spinning. I tried another CD and the same thing happened. I then tried an MP3 CD I burned and it took a long while for it to display all the artists' folders correctly, but when I pressed play, nothing happened! After twenty minutes of this I packed it up and returned it. I had the same bad luck with an RCA MP3/CD portable last year and have come to realize RCA has a long way to go to make their products stable enough to simply play MP3 music without failure."
4,Not so bad for $59,"I got this unit for $59 even after reading many negative posts since I really want a MP3 boombox at home. To my surprise, it can read all my MP3 CD-R/RWs. It does take a while to read the disc before playing, but I guess this is not a problem. The sound quality is ok. Anyway, what you can expect from MP3 music? They have already been compressed. Those who have unpleasant experience might need to read the manual carefully again. The shuffle function is especially useful if you have hundreds of songs in one disc. Since it comes with a remote, I don't think the LCD backlight is necessary once you set up everything."
1,Piece of junk,"I purchased this box at wal-mart and, as mentioned by other reviewers, it can only play MP3 or regular CDs for about 30-35 minutes before it starts getting distorted and seeking all the time and doesn't play unless I shut it down for awhile. The reviewer who said it is overheating is probably correct.The other thing that irritates me is that if there is just a little bit of static electricity on me and I touch the box, the display will go blank and I have to unplug it to reset the display, which also resets all my settings. If I use batteries to keep the settings, I have to remove all the batteries to get the display to return."
2,Unreliable,"I've had my RCD148 for 14 months. It just stopped being able to play CD's of any kind. The motor refuses to run which may be a defective motor or the drive circuits are failing.I liked the great capabilities of this machine, but the reliability is poor. It certainly was not abused, either. No temperature extreems, nor rough handling.I'm not sure what to buy next.PDB"
3,Not bad for the price,"I just bought one of these for $49 at walmart. For that price you can't beat it, but it does have it's problems. Occasionally it will lock up in search mode while trying to access the next track. It will play most of my WMA files. It does lock up on the ones I have embedded graphics in. (That is an option on windows media player9) I thought embedded graphics were neat, till I found out it ruins the playing of the file on anything but a computer. It is noisy when accessing data. I have been listening to some OTR with it. One thing nice for OTR is you can fast foward through the file. And there is some noise from the unit itself on the AM band."
1,I got a lemon,"It's just what I wanted, but mine is heat sensitive & quits playing the CD after about an hour with a room temperature of 77 degrees F. It goes into the ""searching"" mode and stays there or after changing the disk it comes up with a ""No Disk"" message. After cooling off it will play again. It will play much longer when the room is 70 degrees."
3,rca rcd148,"works fine but cd/mp3 player makes lots of noise when playing mp3 data at low volumes,it's as loud as music, sounds like the stepper motor of the laser drive ?.the burst of sound makes its way through the speakers also. does not make the noise when playing a regular CD. I would look at other brands , I probably will return this one back to the store."
1,Stay away from this.,I just started getting into old time radio and was recommended this cd player. It was a disaster. It would play like one hour's worth of stuff and then start skipping and then not play any stuff at all. Tried like others here have said the musicmatch software(very good software though) and even increased the bitrate to hopefully improve play. The same thing happened and it didn't play alot of my collection. It was a disaster. After spending countless hours of frustration on this thing trying to make it work I brought it back to walmart and bought a sony mp3 boombox.I am in heaven with this new player. Sound is better. It doesn't have any skip problems. I listen to all the shows in my car on the way to work now and have none of the problems I had with this model. Save yourself the trouble and spend the extra $50 or so bucks and buy the sony model. You'll be glad you did.
4,Second One,This is my second one. I use it for my 2 sons and after researching the best for the price for a quality item I keep coming back to this one. I replace mine every 24 months for hygene.
3,A little dissapointing,"I read a lot of good reviews about this product before I bought it. It cut pretty well, but it got so hot it was burning my son's scalp."
1,hair today gone tomorrow,"Purchased September 28 2009. Used for two haircuts a month or ten haircuts. Then it stopped working. It runs but that's about all. It's a ""Hair Clipper"" that doesn't clip. Or, looks like I got clipped."
3,AMAZON IS DISGUSTING,"Amazon sent a USED pair had fingerprints, scratches and hair in it.. absolutely disgusting. I would never order anything like this again."
3,I found the price little high for the quality,First trimming came out all right and after that I noticed it did not perform as first time. It is still working though and doing the job done sort of thing.
3,Developed a problem in 30 seconds of use,"Though it seems well made and stout and has plenty of power, mine developed a problem in less then 30 seconds of use - the cutting piece stopped moving back and forth. It jammed. I took the bottom 'holder' piece off and reset it and oiled it well and it started working again, but I'm unsure if the same issue won't come back as there isn't a proper groove or position for this bottom piece to be in, near as I can tell. For this reason, I gave it but 3 stars. If, however it continues to cut well (which it did before it jammed) and the problem doesn't come back, then it would be easily worth a 5 star rating. Good Luck!"
2,Not good for cat hair,"I bought this to use on my 2 cats, one medium-haired, the other long-haired. I wanted it to shave the mats they get under their arms, but it will not cut through without a lot of effort, and I ended up using scissors to cut them the rest of the way off. Very disappointed with this product."
4,Great Clipper,I like this product. Works well and is easy to use. The only downside: It gets a bit warm after using it for a while.
4,worth the $,"Plenty of power - enough attachments - no hair pulling - quiet - quality construction.Have cut my hair and both my sons hair. It cuts very well and quickly. There is no storage case, which seems to be the only drawback, but the unit itself is great."
3,Does the Job but Gets HOT,"The clipper works well, has one conveniently located button, and comes with different sized attachments.Pros-Price-Works well-Various set-Comes with small brushCons-Gets ridiculously hot and is a pain when getting the hair around the ear area-Loud"
2,Do not recommend this product,The clipper was supposed to be new but it seemed to be used (had some hair). Also the clipper vibrate really bead when used.
1,Not Very Good,These are ok clippers if you want a cheap pair of clippers that will last you maybe a year. It takes several passes through some types of hair to cut it. Next time I will spend an extra $40-50 bucks and get a decent pair.
2,Hair clippers,I have arthritis and felt it was too heavy for my hands. I gave it to my dau8ghter and so far she likes it.
4,"Burgeoning category, worth the money (re-read 7/10)","If you like the series The Walking Dead or Y: The Last Man, you will probably enjoy this too. These three series all follow the same parameter- people who need to survive in a post-apocalyptic environment. For all you fan boys, there is not full nudity (at least not anything you would expect), but the language and themes are adult enough to entertain. This book is nothin spectacular, but it is well priced, fast paced, and one of those series that just keeps on putting out issues, because it can dangle you forever, long after the theme gets stale (like Preacher). Like I said, if you like Walking Dead or Y, you should probably get this too. Very clean artwork that looks digital.re-read 7/10** I always include re-read ratings, which means ""what is the likelihood I would re-read re-read this graphic novel. Maus is great, but I won't re-read it. Global Frequency is trash, but you can re-read it often. **"
3,"Solid performances, slight quirks","I don't seriously disagree with the other reviews of this set. I bought the set for Syms. 2 and 4 and have listened only to them.These are OK performances but I find the quirks, compared to other performances I am used to, a bit off-putting. The main comment is thevery opening of the 2nd symphony. The famous horn solo is just different,mostly in articulation of the phrasing. I don't know whether this is because of conductorial decision or a different version of the score. In anycase, let the potential buyer beware and listen to this track online beforebuying."
4,A Good Symphony Set,"These recordings of the Schumann Symphonies with Kurt Masur andthe London Philharmonic on Teldec are very fine performances.The inclusion of the 1841 version of the Fourth Symphony is anice choice, All the symphonies receive good performances byMasur and the LPO, my person favorite being the First. Offeredas a Two for One set it is a very good bargin. The only complaintI have with the set is that there are no liner notes. At leastthere were not any in my copy. Other than that this is a goodset."
5,Happy Violinist,"I bought this for my daughter for her 3rd birthday. What a great purchase. She is very interested in musical instruments, because she sees them on Little Einsteins all of the time. Now she can play along with the Einsteins. She absolutely loves this toy! It has been a big hit with her friends too."
5,"4-yr,old grandchild...""The best gift of all from Santa!""","I can haardly wait to order other items from you...your service is outstanding...this was my first on-line order.Thanks for making these wonderful toys available..I could never find them in a store in Pittsburgh, PA.Sincerely,Joanne"
4,Replacement 5 hp Compressor motor,"Shipment of motor from provider was very prompt.Motor was an exact model current production replacement for the origional one on my compressor.You have to be sure of your motor rotation and the replacement motor rotation, frame type and shaft size etc.The price was the best I could find anywhere for a good quality non-chinese motor.I had the origional motor for more than 10 years of regular use before failure and then installed a chinese one and it lasted only a coulple of years of light use.The new motor seems fine, starts good runs cool) but I have only used it for a month. Be sure YOUR BREAKER IS NEW and JUST the next size above current rating of motor. The WIRING and OUTLET sized for 50 percent more than breaker rating.)This gives you FAST STARTING, COOL RUNNING and quick breaker protection in case of voltage drops or spikes!!!!!!!I AM VERY SATISFIED AT THIS TIME.!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,nice and comfortable.,I purchased this bag for my office.It is really a very a very lightweight and comfortable bag.and is of the perfect size.I got one in red color which is not very flashy but still very bright.The only drawback with this bag is that the main compartment does not have a zipper and if you keep small things they fall out easily.Otherwise a nice bag.
3,Disappointed,"The bag looks good, but the material feels cheap and very lightweight. The shoulder strap is too thin and connected with plastic parts that seem like they'll wear-out or break easily. The bag closes with plastic clips that are difficult to open and close making it a pain to keep it closed properly so things don't fall out. For the price, I guess that's what you can expect."
2,Not as good as 2003,"The 2003 Living Language Spanish desk calendar was great but, in comparison, the 2004 version seems to have been scaled back to the beginner Spanish level. There is a market for Spanish calendars at different competency levels (beginner, intermediate, advanced). I hope the publisher will take note and produce a more advanced level product or products next year."
5,great movie,"It is one of my favorite movies along with the legend. It is worth getting,and I received it quickly. !!!!!!"
5,Much higher quality than expected,"So I ordered a Steeler/Troy #43 jersey last weekend and it arrived in less than 6 days. All lettering has been stitched and it looks amazingly authentic. For the price ($43 plus shipping for the XL) it is extremely high quality, including the stripes which again are material and not heat pressed decals. I wouldn't have been surprised to see this good of a jersey for $150+. Amazing!"
1,Not up to Amazon standards,I never got this because apparently they were out of stock - but I never would have known because the vendor NEVER contacted me back after 2 email inquiries. Poor communication! (or should I say lack of)
5,A Writer of Astonishing Talent,"At a time when good short story writers are plenty, few tell a tale as vividly as J.G. Hayes. Point of fact, this book is a revelation. No, these are not the genteel stories your mom reads in Redbook and Ladies Home Journal beneath the humming dryer at the corner beauty parlor. Rather, these are pungent, sexy, heartbreaking renderings of young people---boys on the verge of becoming men mostly---who are wrestling against the undertow of their sexual desires. All of these stories are astonishing. One at least is a masterpiece. ""When Jesus Came to Town"" is the most vividly dramatic story I have read since first encountering the esteemed William Trevor. May this talented writer enjoy a career at least as long as Mr. Trevor. Bravo."
5,This Thing Called Courage has great humanity,"Joe Hayes has a gift for storytelling. Ostensibly, these short stories are about gay life in South Boston, a tough community of mostly Irish-Americans. He is anything but a 'gay' writer. The characters'lives transcend issues of sexual preference. Joe provides a poignant, deeply felt glimpse into the importance of loyalty & brotherhood and the price they may extract. He is a wonderful humanist with a enthralling literary voice filled with grit, humor and an unerring ear for the local patois of the denizens of ""Southie"". I am crazy about this collection of stories."
1,"Defective, Cheap piece of junk!","This is my second bookshelf system I have purchased. I would have preferred to buy another Sharp ES-600, but they are no longer available so I read up and decided on the RCA RS2625. I had to return it due to the CD player failing to play CD's. It worked for a week and then it wouldn't read any CD's. The drive unit is a pain. In order to get the CD's out of the unit, you have to continually close the door, hit skip disk, open it back up, and repeat this ridiculous operation until your CD is in the proper location to remove it. The tuner reception is awful, I didn't have a chance to use the cassete deck, but I guess if you don't plan on listening to CD's or use the tuner you might be interested in the RCA. I'll be skipping the RCA's when searching for a replacement."
5,Visual and taste-pleasing compilation.,"The Healthy Jewish Cookbook collects one hundred mouth-watering recipes from around the world. Full-color photographs illustrate cultural delicacies from Fava Beans in Olive Oil, to Roast Tomatoes with Garlic, to Vegetarian Cholent, Spiced Lamb Cutlets, Coconut Bread Pudding with Strawberries, and much more.

An index allows for quick and easy references in this visual and taste-pleasing compilation."
4,Las Vegas Story Import,"This review is only going to cover the dvd transfer quality which is acceptable, but far short of what would be considered a high quality transfer. As this title is, as yet, not available in this country, anyone who desires this film I would recommend this edition, providing that you have a pal capable dvd player."
4,What a Story !,This was a good first effort by the writer. The story is original and inventive. He left me wanting more from all of the characters. I look forward to the sequel.
4,Great for men and women!,"Although I'm not a man, I chose this shampoo because it works just as well as women's shampoo without the cloying floral scent. At first, I didn't notice any overwhelming results, but after a few days, my ponytail began to feel thicker. Also, this shampoo didn't turn my hair into an oil slick after a few days of use like lots of other ""volumizing"" shampoos I've tried, and it even made my hair a tad less frizzy. I will continue to use this as long as L'Oreal keeps making it, although I am not holding out much hope because I really liked their old Style Infusion formula and that was discontinued. But I will definitely enjoy this variety and stock up on it while supplies last."
5,I cut my husband's hair- I KNOW the difference this shampoo makes!,"I am the one who cuts my husband's hair.. when I first started noticing his hair thinning I tried all the OTHER hair thickening products out there until I finally found Vive Pro for Men- it has worked WONDERS for YEARS! I have not noticed the thinning SINCE, so I think L'Oreal has a really great product! Too BAD they don't realize it and promote it as such!- THEN maybe we could find it in the stores! My Walgreens was the last to carry it and now they don't either, so here I am once again buying products from Amazon.com!"
4,crazy people,I have used this shampoo for a few years and its fine... It's a shampoo and it helps my sad hair. Any of you spending $22.99 on this shampoo on Amazon are crazy people. This product costs about $3.50 down at your local grocery store. I am well aware that this is not being shipped and sold by Amazon and the price is being set by vendors. Vendors that are apparently making $19.49 on some of you... drive to the grocery
5,Instant gratification!,"It's simple...it just works! I used to use Head & Shoulders Clinical Strength Shampoo, because it would help a lot, and is still a great product, but this stuff blows it out of the water. It's well worth the price if you know how to portion a use properly."
5,Great product,I am pleased with this product as I am equally impressed with the professionalism of its vendors. My hair is thicker and has more shine to it.
2,Didn't work for me,I have used it for about a week now and it has Left My hair feeling flat And as if I never washed after about an hour or so. If it is thickening the actual strands I certainly cannot tell.
2,Meh,I used this shampoo and it makes my hair look thinner than the other shampoo i was using did. This seems to flatten my hair and I'm just not liking it. Only bought it because it's cheap and i needed a temp shampoo to use while i was waiting for the other one to arrive. It's ok as a shampoo but I wouldn't buy it again.
2,Box says for ages 3+; Looks very cheap,"I purchased this item because I thought it would make bath time fun for my baby and the previous reviewer gave this item glowing praise. As I always say, it's a rare day that I give a bad review for something, but there are two main things that are wrong with this toy set that I think people should know.1. According to Amazon's product details, it says Manufacturer's age: 12 months and up and Our recommended age: 12 months - 4 years. This is NOT correct! The box for these bath toys says ages 3+ because it's choking hazard! This is the reason why we are returning it. I am not waiting 2 years to use a bath toy set that I thought was age appropriate for babies.2. The quality of the product is very cheap. It looks like those toy sets you can find at the 99 Cent Only / Dollar stores! The paint is off center, the plastic isn't smooth... I might pay $1 for this set, but not $5, $4 or even $3."
2,Deluxe Bath Toy Set,Not impressive . Poor materials and not attractive. Onlything that attracted this is the price. But even for that not worth having this one spend little more money and geta better set.
3,"Looks great, not very functional.","I ordered the LCJ-VHA Jacket Case for my new Sony DSCV3 camera. It looks great and protects the camera quite well, but you must remove the camera from the case to charge the battery or to download pics. If I had a chance to see it, I would not have bought it."
3,The Mormon view of the Hofmann case,"Despite the comments of previous reviewer's, this account of the Hofmann case is one of the most Mormon sympathetic. It has real value in that it does a good job of getting into the thought processes of Hofmann and other Mormons around him including his girlfriend before he got married, which is a story that Sillitoe is strangely sympathetic to Hofmann compared to the account given by Naifeh who used a phony name for her. The book studiously avoids the role that Hinckly played, and avoids the odd behaviour of the County Attornies office in relation to Hinckly.The book has the advantage of having George Throckmorton as a co-author as he was one of the ""heroes"" of the case.I've read this book and the Naifeh book and several websites for sources about the Hofmann case and this book is for the Mormon perspective. It should be complemented by the Naifeh book which is written from the police perspective."
3,Super small print !,"I have not read this book yet, however, as i do with all my new books, i take a lookto see what it's all about, author etc. Be aware before you buy Salamandar that theprint is super small - other than that it appears to be quite detailed !"
2,Don't believe everything you read!,"My family was involved with the alcohol plant in New Mexico that the authors of the book claimed never existed. I know it actually did exist, I was there. If the authors had done a minimum amount of research, they would have known it too. So this makes me wonder what else they got wrong. I tend to think there was a lot that really didn't fit together, so I'll keep searching for the truth. I hope everyone else does too."
3,"Good feature set, poor long-term reliability","I purchased this router last year and it has served me well for about 6 months. The feature set is comprehensive, flexible, and the configuration is reasonably straght-forward.After about 6 months of flawless service, the router has gone flaky and fails to pass through DNS server info to DHCP clients after it has been up for a while. The router itself reports the DNS servers fine and everything can be fixed with a reboot.D-Link support is outsourced, but can speak and understand english well. However, even with level 2 support, they have not yet been able to come up with a fix."
2,This is my last D-Link Product,"This will be my last D-Link router. For some reason they have the uncanny ability to fail right after the warranty period is over! I had a 524, a 624G and now this one do almost the same thing after the same amount of time. The power led comes on but the router won't respond nor pass traffic. R.I.P. D-Link, i'm going to Netgear!"
2,Dlink Mimo Router,"Not impressed with this thing. I've had too many problems getting it to work properly, with tech support from Dlink. It tends to drop connections when you least expect it!"
2,Never got it to work right,"After spending 4 hours on the phone with people I couldn't understand or hear, the router worked a few times, but would suddenly just drop the internet and I would have to go through the whole setup process again to get it to connect. I finally got it to work, but when I tried to add a D-link range extender, the whole system went down never to be revived even though I spent another 2 hours with support. I finally boxed up the router and returned it to Amazon and bought a Netgear that worked perfectly the first try and connected perfectly with the D-link range extender. I will have to say that D-link support worked hard to get it to work except one tech that I had to rebuke when they tried to dump the problem on Dell."
5,Excellent wireless router,"To me this DI-634M router is the best of all the comparable wireless G routers I have tried (including Linksys, Netgear, Buffalo, Belkin, and Actiontec). It maintains my PPPoE connection faithfully. It also performs virtual servers (e.g., HTTP, FTP, etc.) port forwarding very well."
3,It does the job,"This is a decent router in a good looking package. I do prefer the Linksys routers because they seem to be more robust and the settings interface is much easier to use. I give this unit 3 stars because of its' small footprint, sleek look and because most people with a better connection and less complicated connections than mine will have very few problems."
1,Hate it!,"I've had this for over a year now and I absolutely hate it! The range isn't very good, connecting to my Powerbook G4 (late 2005 version, just before the Macbook Pro). Every other day or so the internet connection drops and I have to log into the control panel and reboot the system. Occasionally I can't even connect wirelessly and have to pull the power on the back of the unit. They haven't updated the firmware in a year (version 2.01), and I would wait to see if they fix these issues before I would recommend anyone buy it."
1,Can't get a connection to stay on,The signal strength always reports excellent but my devices keep dropping from their connections. This is my second 634M and I am taking it back too.
2,Mac Users Beware!,"While this router seems to work OK, it cannot be fully administered from a Macintosh using Safari, even though D-Link claims Mac compatibility. For some unknown reason, the lists of machines and MAC addresses do not show up in the several admin screens that utilize them. After many attempts to work through the issue with D-Link tech support, I gave up. They do not appear to be able to understand, let alone test and fix the problem."
5,One of the best,"This has been one of the best anime series ever, yes, its a bit perverted, but its funny and im a sucker for love stories. My first amine was Please Teacher by Bandai, a very good one. But Heaven's Lost Property is one of the best ones. I am building my anime collection slowly, I recommend this series to any anime fans out there. And I hope season 3 is just as good."
1,The boxset feels incomplete,"I really wanted this, but now I don't know if I should return it. It looks like it was suppose to have Bluray, but now there is just a cardboard box that makes the case full. Without the cardboard box it would be like having half of a season in the box. I don't know how this is ""limited"" I don't want a cardboard box and some post cards that aren't even set up to be post cards instead of bluray discs for the same price as a DVD/Bluray combo. I am very disappointed. It feels like I got half of what I paid for. I thought it had Bluray when I ordered it months ago, maybe I was mistaken, or maybe they changed it. Too long ago to remember."
3,Confused?,Yo i dont get why im getting this all the way in may i just received an email saying ima get the dvd around may 1 through may 7 WTF :(
5,13 episodes of awesomeness!!!!!,"If your looking for a show that will make your laugh, HLP is the way to go. 50% funny, 25% fan service, and 25% story so if you like this ratio you can't go wrong."
5,Heaven's Lost Property Forte: Season Two,"I liked the movie because it was funny. The movie was entertaining. Also, because it had the characters of Season 1."
5,Really good,"If you liked the first season, the second one is better. It does suck that is didn't come out on blu-ray"
3,a collectors item,this is by far a collectors item so get it if you are a collestor of hip hop music (and i don't mean no lil wayne or t-pain crap)real hip hop for real hip hoppers we did'nt do it for the money and become a slave to the industry homeboys so sum-ma-da
3,Required Reference for Incra Jig Projects & Techniques Book,"Unfortunately, the Incra Jig Projects & Techniques book (Perry McDaniel, 1993) sends the reader back to the outdated Incra Jig Handbook and Templates time and again for such methods as setting depth of cut and how to cut dovetail-shaped rabbets. A third and newer book, the Incra Master Reference Guide and Template Library (Perry McDaniel, 2010?)goes into these topics, but not in enough detail to answer all my doubts. I ended up ordering the earliest of the three books (Incra Jig Handbook and Templates) in hopes of finding some of the missing guidance."
4,network of Hitler and his malevolent henchman,"Maracin's popular account of the infamous Night of the Long Knives when Hitler and his henchmen murdered political rivals and numerous private German citizens who had incurred his anger or suspicions for one reason or another; in some cases, something as normal and transient as a news article. In charting the background leading up to the well-coordinated murderous purge of most persons in Germany who would even remotely resist Hitler's seizure of power, Maracin draws profiles of Hitler's top accomplices(e. g., Gobbels, Himmler) and of the major victims too. A retired criminal investigator, Maracin gives a broad view of this few hours during which Hitler laid the ground for his eventual dictatorship, showing how the many actors played their part so as to reveal Hitler's ruthlessness and dementia and the web of evil he wove."
5,Cheap and works,"My phone didn't come with this cable, so I had to order it. It works perfectly on my Motorola Razr V3. I use it to charge my phone and to transfer pictures, mobile apps, and games."
2,eh...,I thought I'd be able to access my razr's pics and everything else with this but it just allowed me to charge the phone though the computer. I can now use it with my blackberry 8330 curve and can access every picture and song on my phone. love my blackberry
4,Awesome!!!,"Who said you cannot get real things for pennies?Best Price:) Great seller quick shipping, Geat Experience :)"
2,will not fit the new Motorola Droid Razr,"The cable was fine and the price is great but the problem is it will not fit the phone I bought it for the new Motorola Droid Razr. Maybe it fit an older model but if you just got the new model this cable won't fit it. Other than that, fast shipping and great price as well as a nice cable! Just wish it fit my phone..."
2,Didn't work with my KRZR K1m,"It didn't work with my motorola phone, but they refunded, so that's cool."
1,Does not work with Moto Z6c,"I bought this to use for my new Moto Z6c, but it has a different size charger than the regular RAZR I used to have.This cable is the right size for my old RAZR, but not for my new Moto Z6c.And it's just not worth it to send it back.On Motorola's website, it called the cable for my new phone a ""mini usb data cable"", but this is not the same thing."
5,great item,"Exactly as described, works perfect using it on my pc or my charger. Couldn't have been any better for my motorola."
1,This will not work as a charging cable,"I bought this assuming I could use it to charge a Motorola v195. It did not work for that purpose. Fortunately, it was cheap, and it is a data cable."
1,get what you pay for,well as i should know by now get what you pay for on here. this doesnt work with my phone or any other phone in my house. it took so long to come i had totally forgot i ordered it. it took 3 extra weeks to get this. i say beware.
1,Didn't work as a USB charger,"I installed some outlets at my house that have USB ports in them. I wanted to use this cable to charge my Motorola RAZR via those ports. Even though it says that it's a cable for the RAZR, it's mostly a data transfer cable and can't be used for charging.Since I have about 5 other identical cables (that weren't labeled as a ""Motorola"" cable that do the same thing, this one just was another cable for the collection."
1,"Was good, is bad","I purchased one cable one year ago, it was very good with Moto logo. So I purchased again recently, but the situation is changed.I Purchased two from two different sellers from my GPS, both are very thin and very low quality, without Moto logo, able to charge the device but can't transfer data."
4,Good one,"It works perfectly on my friend's new laptop. On mine, it searched for days for a driver without success. I think it was more a problem with my PC or OS (Vista). Not sure. It is sturdier than other Mini USBs I have, and better-looking too."
5,What a great book!!!,"As one who loves adventure travel I rate this as one of the best accounts ever for one chasing through this part of the world. It was especially meaningful as I have traveled the same route...The Shetlands, The Faroes, Iceland, Greenland and Labrador. How much fun to re-live it through the eyes of Lawrence Millman. Unlike Millman, I never had the chance to meet and live with the folks like he did. His encounters with the locals are so funny and engaging that you'll find yourself laughing throughout the book. If you are the least bit interested in this part of the world, read this book first and you'll hardly be able to wait to start your trip. This man is truly a great story teller and the kind of guy you'd just like to sit down with and rehash his adventures. What a great book!"
3,mildly entertaining,"The first half of this book is about a young Hasid's bizarre experiments with mysticism, which eventually lead to his mysterious (though clearly accidental) death in a flood. Although Abraham's grasp of Breslov Hasidism may not be 100% accurate (at least according to another reviewer) I nevertheless found this part of the book to be highly entertaining.The second half of the book is a confusing mess; it was entertaining enough for me to finish reading, but not much more."
1,A confused mess,"Sorry but this book was a huge disappointment and nothing more than a confused mess. I assigned ""1 star"" because, at least, ""The Seventh Beggar"" has whet my appetite to research the Kabbalistic mystics."
1,The worst calculus book I have ever read.,"Agree with Jay. The book is hard to read and understand, many of them can be taught in a simpler way but it chose the much unintelligible way of all things. It's too terrible to give it any star. If my calculus class didn't require this book I would never read it any more. If possible, choose others."
4,Great!,"Even though textbooks have answer in the back, it means nothing if you don't know how they arrived at the answer. Thankfully, this solutions manual was cheap and affordable. It helped immensely. My issue is that it didn't have all the ODD problems worked out for you. The authors probably assumed that we would be able to answer questions with just one example answer. That's not always the case..other than that, this solutions manual was my best friend in calculus :D"
3,A Good Read,"This book reads very well. It took me two days to shoot through it casually. There are some mistakes, however, mostly dealing with dates of elections and positions held by officials at the time. As I have seen from others, the truth can be a little open to interpretation. But if you are above the politics and the petty bickering, this can be a very good read for someone who is interested in learning more about the origins of the Bush family."
2,Doesn't live up to the boasts on the cover,"The 1st bullet point on the cover ""Increasing the performance of your application with ADO"" is inaccurate for this book. There is no mention of the Datagrid, MSHFlexgrid, Data Environment, or SHAPE command in the brief ADO section. Databases, VB and Grids have always gone hand in hand, yet the authors totally ignore the grid with ADO. I must note here that this is not the only book that falls short of actually covering the newer features of VB6. In order to actually make use of these new features we are forced to 'fly by the seat of our pants' while gleaning some insight via MS Knowledge Base and a few books who actually bother to attempt to cover the features. However, this book was not much help."
2,A VB-5 Rehash,Publishers of computer books are taking the easy way out and reprinting the same stuff again and again - just putting a new title on it. Many of the examples are VB5 code and won't compile under VB6.
3,Too scattershot.....,"While this book was appropriate for database techniques using JET, and DAO it was not really appropriate for the more heavyweight SQL server RDO/ADO access techniques/ overview. This unfortunately, is another example of a ""salad bar"" ""taste me, taste me"" computer tome/book that misses its mark by trying to be all topics/things to everybody. I was particuarly annoyed by the meager 50 pages devoted to RDO and the 70 pages devoted to ADO all of which were absurdly abbreviated in their scope; it would have been far better to omit them entirely. If you want a serious book on these topics, buy the 6th edition Hitchhiker's Guide to VB/SQL SERVER."
2,Example programs do not compile.,"It would be good if the authors would update the example files so that they compile in VB6 and make them available for download. Also, the authors have elected to adopt a very terse narrative style, thus leaving the reader to fend for himself when he can't figure out what the authors mean. So the narrative is cryptic and much of the code that comes with the book does not compile."
1,Very Poor,This book is long on (basically negative) innuendo and the author's unsubstantiated (and uninteresting) opinions; short on substance or meaningful insights. It rambles. The reader is also treated to plenty of low grade psychobabble. It's a posthumous hatchet-job with lots of typos. No wonder Sir Alec wouldn't have anything to do with the author when approached for an interview.
2,Home Depot wiring book,"The book arrived in almost new condition from the seller and unfortunately I can readily see why. Although the graphics are well done and very clear, the subject matter is strictly elementary, and is really intended for readers who have absolutely no experience whatsoever. Hence it wasn't used very much.So if you are a complete novice, and need a great introductory text to help you through elementary chores like replacing a wall outlet, this is the book for you.Anyone looking for more advanced wiring instruction would be better off looking elsewhere.Perhaps an informal rating system for ""how to"" books should be implemented by Amazon. A simple three tiered system like; basic, intermediate, and advanced would be helpful.DSK"
4,Wiring 1-2-3,The books condition is satisfactory but worth it. Overall the book is very helpful with small home projects. Good pictures and easy to understand directions.
4,Wiring 1-2-3,Book was in decent shape. Content-wise there should be more proper schematics rather than the cartoon/comic images that are hard to interpret and sometimes ambiguous.
3,I felt it more in my quads,"Not a bad video, but I felt knee strain and really only felt the exercises in my quads and only somewhat in my hamstrings & glutes.It is full of squat & lunge variations. If she would have included floor work that targets the buns, it would have been a keeper. I didn't keep this video of Tamilee's. I prefer her old Buns Of Steel tapes to this one."
4,TIght Buns!,"I love Tamilee. She knows her stuff and keeps you motivated. I have all 3 I want those ABS, Arms and buns. I would have purchsed I want that Body but already had the seperate tapes. They are all great. I also enjoy the Firm workouts as well as Denise Austins Pilates and Blast 10 lbs. Tamilee's workouts can be as intense as you make them. Increase your weights! You can always pick up lighter ones if it gets to hard. These workouts target the area and really give it a workout."
1,Very stressful on the knees,"I have and really like two of the other tapes in this series (""I want those abs"" and ""I want those arms"" which is why I purchased this tape. However, I was very dissapointed in the workout and plan to give it away. I am in better than average shape and work out on a regular basis. After doing these workouts, I felt nothing in my legs/buns but my knees hurt for days. I don't believe that it was my form since the exercises are simple and well known. I therefore do not recommend this tape."
5,Tamilee is now my favorite instructor!,"What I truly love about this video is the fact that Tamilee is instructing one on one. She is soft spoken, knowledgeable and motivating without being condescending or obnoxious. This video gave my rear and legs a superb workout! The sumo squats are a killer!! I didn't have trouble with my knees throughout the workout or afterwards (you have to be extremely careful not to extend you knees beyond your toes). I'm so glad I purchased this video!"
5,Beyond the Soul,"When I read this book several years ago, I found myself extremely drawn to the chapter on Becoming the Phoenix... And it has taken me this long to re-find the book, as I had problems finding it in my local library system."
4,Lovely and inspirational,"While this is not a word-for-word translation of the famous text, it is instead an inspired one. We use portions of the book in our Egyptian/Kemetic/Tamaran Temple rituals, and it always proves to be at the least enlightening, and at the best utterly transformational. Stodgy and stilted, the translations of the last century (and before) do not speak to the heart, to the living ritualist who seeks not to mechanically ressurect the ancient Egyptian religion but who instead worships the Netjer because of how they are touched by this path. The Netjer is very much alive, and although I don't like some of Ellis' other works in this area, ""Awakening Osiris"" is truly divinely inspired and breathes life and understanding into the Osirian mysteries and beyond. Highly recommended for both personal meditation and temple use."
4,good book,"Awakening Osiris is a good book. Allay the question of the trueness of the translation and envelop yourself in the reading. The invocations and prayers, praises and prose are simple and fluid. The passages are down to earth at times and lofty at others. Enobling, the work is sympathetic to the contemporary soul. I read Awakening Osiris years ago and it still has a place in my heart and a well deserved home on my bookshelf among the more scholarly works of ancient Egypt."
5,A truly awakening,"Amazing transportantion through words to the land of Osiris. A poetic revalation of the Book of the Death, far from just a translation but the tale of the Gods, whom are awakened within the ones who believe. The book which gives life was beautifully represented by this enlightening work."
5,Pleasant music.,I like OM chanting mantra. Thanks to S.P. Balasubramanyam. He got great voice.It is only OM chanting nothing else. Beware before buying this album.
4,-Panambi,"Beautiful phrasing! David is blessed to have an expression olderthan his years. He was just in time to live in the beauty ofan era of fantastic music. With his life experiences he hasentered a wonderful portal of communication. I hope hefinds it is also what he loves. sincerely, jessandjazz"
2,This is a real beginner's guide,"The book was a great disappointment to me. The title and subtitle (Analytical and statistical techniques) led me to think that the book covered fixed income securities at a sophisticated and advanced level. Not so. If you need to learn how to calculate a PV, FV or IRR, this is the book for you...otherwise probably not!"
2,Phone book edition,"Kudos to the author - good content from what I've read so far, but a pox on the publisher - a layout painful to behold with the eye. It's a history book with 932 pages of block text on newsprint paper with no illustrations, maps, or photographs, like it was pulp fiction. I would have paid twice as much to have a well-published history in two volumes.Thankfully, there are sub-heads and a few drop-caps that break up the visual desert but only with marginal success."
4,Great Book - A must read for the whole family,This books gives you the real and true american history. This is stuff our kids are not learning in schools today. This is a must read for everyone in the family to see how our culture has changed what they are teaching our kids in schools and how the portray our history.
2,"started ""ok"" but then downhill","1st of all I agree with the author's basic premis that many of today's works of history have a horrible anti-American bias from left wing nuts who live off the government dole on tenur at our universities. This book started out ok but went down hill as one gets closer to the present. By the time one gets to Reagan and Clinton forget about any objective reasoning. The final 150 pages of this book can be summed up as Republican/ Conservative=good; Democrat/ Liberal= bad. If the author were to spend the last 50 pages merely repeating that phrase over and over again, he would fufill his purpose. I do not care to waste my time with a ""history"" written by either Micheal Moore or Rush Limbaugh."
5,Superb Survey of the REAL American History,"I greatly enjoyed this excellent counterpoint to Howard Zinn. If I were teaching a US history survey course, this would be the text I would use. Some reviewers have asserted that this book is for conservatives. Rather, this is for people who love America and are tired of reading history books written by those that don't. There is plenty of balanced history in this book and none of America's past problems are glossed over. I've recommended this book to all my friends and colleages."
1,An Ego Stroking Guide to Aid American Exceptionalism,"This book is notably biased. (Note that people who bought this book also bought Glenn Beck's Broke, don't act surprised). I bought it to compare against other historical secondary and primary sources of American history because I want to gain a relatively centrist view of American history. Personally, I find the country's history to be fascinating and deserving of extensive investigation. I can say with some certainty that this book is not a very accurate depiction of American history. The dates and key players involved are accurate; the motives and the interpretations, not so much."
1,Fantastic...ly stupid,"Seriously, everyone - when's the last time a white straight guy got his due in history books? Schweikart says all of those historians who talk about racism against brown people are missing the point that the brown people ARE ALL DANGEROUS TO OUR [racist? economically exploitative? misogynist?] way of life as Americans... or at least, a threat to the white dudes and their wives that live on top. The book barely qualifies as revisionism - it's more like 'we're racist, so what' -ism. Because, as Schweikart tells us, it's not racist because history [written by whom?] has revealed the ways in which all brown people are evil.If you need to rinse your mouth of the stupidity contained between these covers, I would suggestA People's History of American Empire- it has pictures, for all of you who don't like the pages filled with words and logic."
2,Not happy as a Southerner,"I have been so excited to read this book. I fully enjoyed it UNTIL we came to the Civil War and Gen. Sherman. Absolute Northern B.S. I am so unhappy with the praising of Sherman and his burning of the South that I will NOT recommend this book to anyone. The Union Soldiers under Gen. Sherman raped, killed, and destroyed the south, their own AMERICAN family and that is good? I love to listen to Glenn Beck and took his advice on reading this book. As informed as I believe Beck to be, HOW can he not know the same propaganda and lies that happen today in the Obama administration also happened in Lincoln's administration."
1,I must not know what the word Patriot means,"This book is much like a porn movie that has all sorts of sets and situations but each scene ends the same way. It turns out that every event in American history can be linked to the current Right Wing agenda and anybody who acts contrary to this agenda is berated in this book.If thats what ""patriot"" means I am not sure I want to aspire to be one."
3,Rewrite History Much?,"Reading most of the reviews it seems that this book suffers from neoconitis, the inability to present accurate facts in an attempt to re-write history to support a minority political agenda while claiming to be patriotic. This book could have been just a blog if the writer had not been a professor. Just like all those neo-con screen names I see all over such as ""truepatriot"", ""redwhiteblue"", ""americafirst"", etc and they all rant about neo-con agenda's regardless of the fact that most of the owners are middle-class who have been hurt worse than the republican rich over the last 50 years. The nail in this books coffin was Glen Beck's raving endorsement (really didn't need to use the word ""raving"" since that's all Beck does).A more accurate title would have been, ""A Neo-Con's Rewrite of the History of the United States""The biggest con has been Fux News calling itself News..."
1,What a farce.,"This book reminds me of the story of two men talking about the days of knights and kings.First man ""Gee, it would have been great to live in those days.""Second man ""Yeah, if you rode the horse, but what if you cleaned up after the horse.""In the same way, these writers have chosen to look at history from one viewpoint. History is much more than that. History is not supposed to be so slanted that you don't even recognize it as in this book. They have completely forgotten that the greatness of the United States is not that it perfect the first time, but that if isn't perfect it can be corrected."
5,A Patriot's History,"The seller responded quickly, and the book was exactly as described. Highly recommend purchasing from this seller."
2,Little to the Right,"This history is a good general history up until about the 1950s. From this point on, especially during the Reagan to Bush II years it is way too far on the right. This section would be a good are for students to read as an extreme version of history which one could use to critique. It would be interesting to see how the authors would relate the past few years since the book's publication. I would like to see how they paint $3.59 per gallon gas as a problem of the Clinton years. I would not use this as a regular text by any means."
5,GREAT!,"Thorough. Easy to read. Moves easily. Not boring. Indicates logical cause and effect relationships without forcing social agenda. Balanced. Neither ""my country do or die"", nor ""America the Horrible"". Doesn't lie about the defects, but does state positive as well. Actually, a joy to read. Thank you, authors & publishers. I appreciate the opportunity for the read."
5,A Patriot's History of the United States,"Although I have not finished reading this history, it will be a reference for all of the questions about our history in the future. It is especially noteworthy for its' plenitude of footnotes and references of orginal materials."
3,Need help packaging?,"This is a great book. I think everyone should read it & have it on hand to refer back to once in awhile. Whoever packaged this book though, needs some help. I came wrapped in thick paper only. The edges & corners were all pushed over kind of bad & in one spot, the back was broken completely. Again, the book is a great read, just disappointed in the way it came."
4,Patriot's History of the US,I got this on time. It was all in one piece and I even got it before my school even started. One very happy customer
4,History from a Pro-America Point of View,"In today's environment, it is refreshing to find an account of U.S. history that does not portray America as the villain. Larry Schweikart and Michael Allen, in ""A Patriot's History of the United States"", tell the in-depth story of America from 1492 through the early years of the twenty-first century.In more than 800 pages, the two authors cover all of the important topics of American history, from our independence and founding, through our westward expansion and modernization, including examination of religion, politics, race and gender relations, social trends, military history, and technological breakthroughs. The drawback of the book is that the authors do get a few dates wrong. On the whole, though, this work is a great history of America and would be enjoyed by anyone who believes that this country is not evil, but is the greatest nation the world has ever known."
1,biased ignorance,"Don't waste your time with this claptrap. If you want to understand US History and how progress was made, then read Howard Zinn's People's History of the United States. There's nothing patriotic about burying one's head in the sand and believing this self-serving whitewashed tripe."
1,Just a tad on the biased side of things...,"If considering buying this book, you only need read the excerpt provided to let you in on its agenda.We are informed in the first several pages that Tenochtitlan was a ""monstrously large"" city. One wonders if the authors would have used that characterization if they were truly striving for a balanced history.The authors seem barely able to conceal their glee at the thought of Cortez killing over 100,000 Aztecs in the sack of the city. We are assured that it is a righteous stuggle, the Aztecs were inhuman monsters, and it was the least the poor Spaniards could do to bring the savages God and government. It seems the authors forgot about the atrocities committed by Columbus and Spaniard rule. (Incidentally, in Zinn's book, both Aztec and Spaniard atrocities are addressed)Please, please, do not buy this book."
1,"Not History, this is Political Ramblings","I despise books that are disguised as history. This is only vaguely history, or actually it is reshaping history to fit a current agenda. Don't be fooled, have the intelligence to see the difference between genuine history and political hackery disguised as history."
1,Revisionist History,An utterly unreliable and disingenuous history of the US. Its tortured conclusions and blatant disregard for widely available information that disagrees with the authors' biases make this the most slanted and disingenuous history of America available.
3,Yup! Fair and Balance like Bill O'Reilly.,"Do the authors actually believe leftists are fabricating how so called ""Patriotric"" causes will lead to our countries demise? Read any recent book by Chalmers Johnson....he's NOT a leftist, he's not a ""hater"" and guess what he says?..... Never mind you all just go ahead and keep believing that White Anglo Saxon Males and the U.S. Empire are the real victims."
3,just read one page,"I happened to see this book for sale in my supermarket, picked it up and started browsing its Revolutionary War chapter. The one page I read said that all the detachments from General Burgoyne's British army in 1777 were defeated by the Green Mountain Boys, led by Ethan Allen. Actually there were two detachments, one to Fort Stanwix, which was defeated by Peter Gansevoort's NY line, and one toward our Continental Army supply depot at Bennington, stopped by NH's John Stark and Seth Warner's (not Ethan Allen)green mtn boys that summer. If the authors are reading this, you might want to correct that page before the next edition. (I revised my comment based on feedback from a reader, who correctly thought my original review was unfair, since I only read a few pages.) - Gregory Edgar"
2,Absolutely nothing interesting to offer,"This isn't as polemic as I think it wants you to believe. If you want an interesting account of American History through a conservative lens, read Paul Johnson's book. This book is basically a boring textbook with some inserts of American Exceptionalism language. Even though I don't necessarily agree with Johnson's book I still find it interesting and important to read these editorialized accounts of American History (like Howard Zinn as well) but this one simply has nothing interesting to offer."
4,Knowledge is power....do you know where you came from?,"Very interesting to understand where we came from and how this country was actually founded. History........Factual history needs to be understood by all people, and this is a great start. Some areas are breezed over in this book, but to go into detail on everything in our nations history would fill thousands of pages."
5,Awesome but needed a supplement - which I found!,"I'm reading this bit by bit, slowly, so as to digest it fully and better be able to share it with our 15-year-old son, whom I'm going to have read part of it this summer.As I started the introduction and first chapters, I realized I was in dire need of a supplemental book - something with maps that would go along with the reading. And I realized I possessed such a thing: [...] The Hammond United States History Atlas, which I had to purchase my freshman year in college for a history class, which was never used in college and somehow survived to reside on our 15-year-old's book shelves (still never opened).The Hammond book goes PERFECTLY (so far, anyway) with the Patriot's History. I recommend buying BOTH. (I have the 1984 Hammond paperback; I realize there is a newer edition, but I don't know if it's the same book or if it's been re-edited (liberalized) from the version I have.)Enjoy!"
5,A Patariot's History,"This is the history I remember from school, and should be a required read in all high schools. Our children need to know where we've been so they'll know what they're losing. Please, teachers, start teaching the truth not something that belongs in your agenda. Our children deserve the best and this is the best."
4,Tons of information!,This book is pretty much an overview of American History with more in depth discussion of the major events. It is a very long read but you have a lot of history in this book! I learned so much from it and while long it's very easy to read. If you are interested at all in learning more about American History I would highly recommend this book!
1,"No evidence, all bias.","This is a book written only to refute the People's History of the United states. It is unlike that book in one striking way. This fake history does not use primary sources, but merely retells the history from a right wing, pro-Republican point of view. If you like that type of lie, then turn on Fox news and save yourself $25. Otherwise, don't waste your time or money on this ""book."""
4,Good Book,This book is obviously new but cover paper could have been in better condition. Delivery a tad slow but not a problem.
5,History Lesson as it should be taught,Every school child should be taught American History from this book. Every adult should read this book. It tells it like it happened.History buffs will love it.
1,utter drivel from a paid Heritage Foundation hack,A complete dishonest revisionist white washing of anything remotely approaching as American war crimes. Don't waste your time. Anyone with an inkling of knowledge regarding US history will have a difficult digesting this book.
4,Thorough and Interesting Perspective,"I understand that this is a ""patriot's"" take on the events, but its good to get that different perspective from time to time. The book itself is very detailed and provides a more personal touch to the historical content than many others.I would recommend this book, whether you are conservative or liberal, just to get this perspective."
1,I wish I could give it no stars.,"Ought to say ""endorsed by the KKK and Fox News""Don't let the title confuse you. This isn't the patriot's history. It's a racist's history."
1,unbelievably biased,"Words such as ""right wing"", ""republican"", or ""biased"" are inadequate at describing the baseness of this book. Slavery is justified by claiming that slaves were not treated any differently than white servants and that their owners were conscientious about the system. Sexism is justified by claiming that women received lower pays because that's a good incentive for men to work. Killings of Indians are justified by depicting Indians as terrible fighters who inflicted deaths and injuries to the settlers. Intellectual freedom is chastised by claiming that liberals are ""checked"" by the good sense of religion and society. The only more stunning thing than the book itself is the fantastic rating the book receives from amazon readers. Shame on the authors, shame on Americans who drink this poisonous stuff heartily. To be fair, there is a lesson a reader can learn: that is how incredibly twisted a ""patriot""'s mind can be."
2,Ever hear of someone trying to learn from their good intentions?,"Not really, no. That's because we don't need a lesson in trying to do good in the world. We are already presented with this side of history when we are children, but if you missed that part of social studies, this is the book for you."
1,Pie In The Sky...,"I have a great deal of criticism for American History Academia.That said, I believe this book is an attempt to rewrite history to please the ignorant. It amazes me to see how blatently people can pull the wool over the eyes of the people with a few ""patriotic"" tear tugs. If you must wallow in American History, and if you don't have the courage to face truth, then this book is for you.Put your head in the sand and never, never admit to the truth. We have done some pretty dastardly acts in the name of Patriotism. But, what does it matter? It matters because we will never raise an enlightened citizenry with this distortion.I have been an historian for thirty years. It pains me to attempt to rise to the level of maturity only to see it all go down, for the sliver of influence in America that co-opts common sense for a political gamesmanship.You really can't know anything about history without attempting to know it all, good, bad and ugly.Read SEIZING DESTINY, by Kluger....excellent!"
3,Interesting Read,"Not a bad read if you don't mind the Republicans portrayed as Saviors of the world and Democrats as spawn of the devil. A few interesting facts and lots of supposition. Its obvious in the latter chapters that the author has drunk too much Tea Party Kool-Aid, e.g., Limbaugh and Drudge saved the country during the Clinton administration, WMD's in Irag justifying the second war. Fun to re-live the timeline of history, just be careful not to succumb to the author's rhetoric."
2,"Gives insight to Republican thoughts however, many inaccuracies","Let me state it was interesting to see history by a skewed point of view. It gave insights to how some people think and obviously they believe it is better to skew the truth than tell the truth. One example, according to the book the WPA and CCC did nothing but waste money and nothing lasting came from it. They need to come to Duluth MN to see the truth. In 2012 a monstrous flood never seen before wiped out parts of Jay Cooke park created by The CCC and is being rebuilt today. This is just one of the many parks. Sewer and water systems still exist under out city. And this is just one example of the many inaccurate statements in the book. Don't read if you want the truth about history."
4,American History Unzipped,Public School American history never even scratched the surface of what this book presents. (My public school attendance ended just over 60 years ago -- and from what I hear things have not improved since then.) So this book is giving me what I wish I had been taught in those past days. It is my belief that many (if not most) Americans really know little of our country's history. More of us should read this fine book.A Patriot's History of the United States: From Columbus's Great Discovery to the War on Terror
2,fact + opinion = patriotism?,"The author presents himself in contrast to Howard Zinn and like Zinn admits his political and historical bias from the outset which I certainly respect. That said, however, admitting bias does not excuse misrepresentation of historical facts.The author can write whatever he pleases. He can even call it 'history' if he wishes. And if his publisher lets him, he might even get away with it. But that does not necessarily make it so.If you want to read a history of the US that will reinforce your conservative political views, this is the book for you. If not, well... not.If you like facts. This is not the book for you."
1,A Dittohead's View of US History,"Basically, this book can be summed up in a word: silly. Everyone is entitled, I guess, to their own opinions, but when they mask as a rigorous history of the United States, more must be expected. Much of the book is standard high school stuff, but when he gets into such subjects as divorce, feminism, and regulations affecting business the screws come loose. Of course, like many right-wingers, he likes to wrap himself in the robes of patriotism. It's a ""patriots"" history. All other histories are, at worst, unpatriotic or at least suspect. All you need to know: the introduction, of sorts, is a glowing interview with that remarkable ego, Rush Limbaugh and like Rush and his ilk, the author is most interested in calling out the suspicious characters who have led this great nation astray. That is, away from God, flag, and money. Especially money."
5,Great account of the facts surrounding America's history,"Just about half-way through, but very happy with the purchase. It's nice to have a detailed accurate account of America's history without opinion or slant. Definitely much more enjoyable than the history I was presented during my schooling. You won't be disappointed with this book."
3,A Patriot's History of the U.S.,"this is a very interesting well written book on out country. Very lengthy, but if you stay with it, informing."
5,This was a great purchase!,In my recent school book purchase I was very impressed once again with how quickly i received my purchase. I was also very impressed with the condition that the book came in.
5,Refreshing perspective,What a contrast to the textbooks I was required to read in college! You get the facts of history without the liberal indoctrination and slant. I blew a fortune on a History degree when I could have just read this book.
1,A real STINKER,"This rubbish was genuinely hard to stomach. I was prepared to read some interesting information, but was just beaten down by this TURD-HILL of historical revisionism."
1,Blank pages - is this a rip off??,"Just received my copy of ""A Patriot's History of the United States"". While thumbing through the 900 + pages I noticed that pages 486-518 are blank. What is up with that??Also, Amazon did not put in any paperwork for returning the book. What is up with that?I had hoped for an interesting read but looks like I have been ripped off. This is a poor printing job at the least. Haven't any idea if the content is worth a hoot. Buyer beware!"
1,Read Orwell first,"I know this book is supposed to be a right-wing spoof of Howard Zinn's brilliant ""People's History,"" but before anyone reads ""A Patriot's History of the United States,"" they should first read George Orwell's ""1984."" In it WInston Smith is employed at the Ministry of Truth and works rewriting history. That's exactly what Conservatives have done for generations. That is why Zinn wrote his books, because textbooks have a right wing spin that leave out the voices of the oppressed - every month is ""White History Month."" I've read chunks of this book and it just scares me of how brainwashed people are. I only hope it inspires more people to read Zinn."
3,Larry Made a valiant effort,"I had heard great things about the book. My conservative friends had said good things about it.But as I have used it as a text book for 11th graders, it has been a disappointment in many areas.He did great until right before the War Between the States. He is very opinionated, as am I, but he definitely is a yankee through and through. Yankees are a bit arrogant and love to tell others ""how it was"" even if the facts don't exactly match up.He loves Lincoln a bit too much, almost treating him as a Messianic figure. As a good southerner, it is hard to tolerate. But to the victors go the spoils.He is a neoconservative and although I agree with him 75%, he falls short in many areas.This book is certainly thorough, but his opinion is a bit too biased to call it a text. More facts and less opinion would have made a better book.Still better than 95% of other US History books."
3,An Honest Review,"This book should be called the ""Economic History of the United States"". I was extremely disappointed by the content that the writers included (or did not include) since this book is supposed to be a comprehensive look at American history. I'm not crying for more PC coverage (this book spends enough time talking about slavery and Native Americans) but just more of the important facts. Pages (and I mean PAGES!) are spent talking about banks, taxes, and tariffs (which really does make for dry reading) while the Civil War and WW2 (let alone smaller events)I feel are hardly covered enough. The historical specialties of the authors can clearly be told by what they decided to cover in their writing. This book is often boring to read although there are some interesting parts to make up for it(especially the first few chapters). The book is not all bad but I recommend you look elsewhere for an overview of American history.(Let me know if you find a good one.)"
1,Too white,I was induced by rave flashing notices on the amazon music page and added it to my cart. I don't know why we need these guys when we have recordings from Clifton Chenier et al.
1,This one not for me,"I've enjoyed some Steve Riley but this CD was a disappointment. In their search to expand the genre, I think they got lost. The result isn't good cajun, zydeco, swamp rock, or anything new."
4,The best antidote to 'nostalgia',"Whenever a jazz artist goes back to the roots, there are critics who brand his efforts as 'nostalgia', as maneuvres in recycling the all-too-familiar. As to this record, nothing could be more remote from the truth. It's one one of my favourite albums of 2003 - and there aren't too many, let me assure you of that. What Branford and his ensemble(s) achieve on this album is a celebration of the best traditions in jazz - the swing, the tenderness, the passion and -last but not least- the humour that pervade so much of classic jazz, both in concert and on disc. This is a record to enjoy alone or with friends, a perfect blend of the old and the new."
2,What the $@#&!!?,"I don't know what Branford is trying to do. It's like he's taking two steps backward into the ""let's never leave the distant past"" territory of his brother Wynton, like he's abandoning all the artistic progress he made by building on the past with stuff like The Dark Keys the incredible Footsteps of Our Fathers (check out Resolution). It's not that it's a bad CD, but for Branford, it's an awful CD. Fans will be disappointed, but newcomers will only be misled."
2,Almost unlistenable,"I too will be brief. There's no excuse for this idiocy. What we've got here is an exercise in pure nostalgia: The technically impeccable Marsalis family slavishly bowing to the Sacred Jazz Tradition (and you'd better know it and appreciate it, too, buddy!). Why not do something creative with the tradition, like Greg Osby did on St. Louis Shoes (deconstruct and brilliantly put back together standards) or Ted Nash on Still Evolved (smartly evoke the entire scope of jazz by writing pieces recognizably within it, but doing so in a way entirely consonant with contemporary jazz esthetics)?If you want to hear tired old tunes lovingly rendered, fine. This record's for you. If you want real jazz, look elsewhere.One extra star because, despite the unattractive vibe, there are some moments of really fine playing."
4,Confused...,"Great album, as is anything by this godess - but am I the only one who thinks the song title listing is totally WRONG? Feedback, please!"
4,MSR Titan Kettle,"The MSR Titan Kettle works well. I am pleased with its durability, weight, and packability. The only downside is that the lid fits very snugly, so you need two hands to remove it. Then again, that probably contributes to its packability."
4,great kettle,"A bit smaller than expected, but it will work excellently for my single camping trips.Yes it will hold both the small and large MSR fuel containers quite easily.Not sure how people get the pocket rocket and a small fuel canister to fit."
5,Great for the light traveler.,"This kettle came exactly as advertised! It is light, pours well, and is strong. When used with my alcohol stove it can come to a full boil quickly thanks in part to the tight fitting lid. I have found that the kettle pours better if you keep the hole in the lid closer to the handles and not the spout. The only complaint I can come up with is the handles can rattle a little loosely, and they get as hot as the kettle so you still need a rag or heat resistant glove to grab the kettle off of the fire. A rubber band keeps them quiet while travelling, and we take gloves for the wood fire anyway so c'est la vie. While backpacking my father and we can cook for the both of us with the one kettle. I highly recommend this product."
3,The Dribbles,It's great quality like most MSR I would have liked it to hold a few more ounces.If you boil a full pot there is no way to start pouring without dribbling some till the water level is lower! Best to fill 3/4 full or beware of some really hot water where you might not want it.
3,Good picture and sound,"I thought the 20"" Toshiba had a good picture and good sound. I would rate it at 3.5 stars. One problem I found but I'm not sure if its just my tv or if others have this problem. When I use the headjack I get like a humming noise."
4,Great Performance,"This recording was originally released in the LP era. The sound quality was quite good, with much presence and depth to the sound. This transfer to CD seems to have lost a little of that quality. The presence isn't quite there.Giulini's accompaniment is rather dry, which the CD transfer seems to make more evident. But the performance by Perlman is excellent. Truly a virtuoso of the highest order!Perhaps not the greatest overall performance, but one well worth hearing!"
4,Good performance that showing's its age,"This is quite a good performance, but I agree that it appears to have lost a bit in the transfer to CD. It's not always noticeable and is still a great buy."
2,Too spicy,"It's likely that Perlman is too self involved in the music and I doubt if he is playing Beethoven's concerto. Maybe I am wrong since Beethoven might be as sentimental as Chopin, but I just cannot read anything like this from his other music. Simple interpretations given by Oistrakh, Schneiderhan, Heifetz, Kaagan and Zukerman are more enjoyable."
4,OK,"How about some drama? I've heard several 'dry' recordings of this concerto. You need Kreisler, Milstein or Francescatti for this one; they play Beethoven with the nobility of expression that his violin concerto requires. The Kreisler cadenzas are preferred, making best use of Beethoven's thematic material. Unfortunately, infobytes don't always include information onthe cadenzas a violinist chooses. Don't get Heifetz either, since he never stops to smell the roses and there are plenty of roses to sniff here."
4,Great Recording,This recording is fantastic. My wife had another copy of this on CD and it broke. I found this one and she absolutely loves it! It's a wonderful piece that was played fantastically!
2,Yawn,"Perlman's Beethoven is technically sound, and in tune. It is not, however, bold, exciting, unique, or interesting. His high notes are frequently lost in the orchestra, it's too slow (classical era, NOT romantic), and despite the perfect intonation, his passage work is boring, repeated sections are noticable, and there just isn't enough raw power in his playing for this piece. Listen to the orchestra part if you doubt me. It clashes with the placid nature of Perlman's playing. I generally love Perlman's recordings, but I think he just got it wrong with this one.If you want the most amazing performance of Beethoven's violin concerto ever recorded, as it should and was always meant to be played, buy Heifetz's recording with the Boston Symphony. Simply stunning. If you want Perlman playing an etude with some decent cadenzas, get this ""classic""."
5,Passionate performance of the 4 seasons,"We've all heard the four seasons many times and I thought I was good but when I heard this version on the radio I was struck at how different it sounded- very passionate- if you're looking to hear it again- this is a great version. And of course it was right here on Amazon ""a click and a day away"" - pure internet experience."
5,Vivaldi is more than the Four Seasons,"Anyone buying this CD for the great Il Giardino Armonico interperation of the Four Seasons will have their expectations exceeded. At track 13 be prepared for a surprise. Vivaldi wrote many pieces that are even more beautiful than the Four Seasons and this is one of the most compelling. This version of Op 8/No 9, RV 454 is a truly special composition. In this CD we hear the oboe version. In the Op 8, volume 2 CD we hear the same composition (and listed as RV 236) played with the violin. I would buy both CD's just for this piece alone! The oboe version is calm and assured while the violin version contrasts by being delicate and refined. I'm absolutely blown away by the sublime key and abrubt tempo changes in the first allegro movement. These sounds are one more example of the truly world class and mesmerizing musical effect of Vivaldi and Il Giardino Armonico."
4,"looks great and easy to install, minus washers","easy to install since you can get the wiring done before you put any of the heavy parts on. if you have trouble getting the caps to screw onto the bolts, do not stress out or waste time like i did... just remove the washers. (will require pliers)the provided bolts were too short by about 1/4 inch so i had to remove the washers. i'd tried using bolts of the same size from lowes, but these ones have a very shallow threading on them. so the lowes bolts wouldn't fit on the washer or end cap correctly. tried 8/32, 6/32, and metric. removing the washers gave enough space for the bolts to catch, but does put more pressure on the somewhat flimsy outer rim. seems fine though."
1,A waste of money,"I bought the workout videos first and wasn't crazy about them, but was excited about videos that were just bellydance instruction. I wish I could return both sets and the music, too. The music is AWFUL! I had trouble getting past the music, feeling like I was watching a porno movie. The movements and the choreography were uninspiring. I think these videos are more of the same thing as the other videos and just a way to get you to buy more videos by putting them in different packaging and a different set. Try the other bellydance videos on Amazon."
1,why did I waste my money?,"It truly appears to me that someone saw the Belly Twins taking a beginner belly dance class, and said, ""Hey, I'm going to make them stars because they have a genetic defect!"" And viola, we have the Sensual Art of Bellydance. They know nothing about dance, bellydance, or exercise, and have no business passing themselves off as such. I wouldn't be surprised if someone filed a lawsuit against them. They have no credentials whatsoever, and after wasting my money on this boxed set, I understand why: they are not qualified. People, please read the boxes before you buy, and if you are interested in bellydance, consider qualified instructors such as Rania and Dolphina."
5,review Bellydance 3 dvd set,"Love it! I was looking for something fun that I would do regularly not for strenuous exersize but something fun, different and not sedentary. The moves are different but the instruction is good - it takes a few times on many of the moves to get it down but it is pretty easy to follow. This is great, fun, uses different movements and muscles than most. It is also very balanced, sensual and peaceful."
4,Pretty fun,"I bought these tapes after 4 months of bellydance instruction. While these tapes cannot compare with a class, where a teacher can correct and encourage you, I think they're pretty good just for fun dancing. I expect they'll be useful when I move and can no longer take classes. :(There is only one regret that I have about this -- I wish that I had not bought the boxed set, as I did not like the Basic Moves tape at all. I watched it once and was very bored, as I (with my small experience) already knew the moves on that tape. If you have ANY bellydance experience, I recommend getting just the other two tapes. If you don't have any experience, then get this set and enjoy!"
4,It's a good one,"I think Bidasha sisters are amazing dancers, the video is very well done the music is nice but it I think it could be better. I learned a lot and they gave me lots of new ideas. But I would prefer that instead of learning a dancing routine, it would encourage to improvisation, but anyway it is a good video. Another thing that could be perfect is a routine with finger cymbals! and they dont include this. I recomend it if you want some good ideas for your performance."
2,Not my favorite,"I went on a shopping binge and bought 6 bellydance videos( I have always wanted to learn). This was not the best or the worst. The video was very professional(unlike some) and had a nice set. I found the videos a bit dull and dare I say it? OK I will: The instructors lacked Sensuality. Since this is the title of the video, I was expecting the instructors to have more passion and sensuality. The instruction is done in voice over, so the instructors have the most artificial smiles on their faces through-out the entire video. It is not inspiring and a bit annoying. The movements are broken down clearly, so it is not a total waste of money."
5,Great for beginners,"I found this video very helpful. It starts out slow and goes faster. Very good for beginners like myself. They show several basic moves, isolations, and hand work in a manner so you can get it. I didn't get lost in this video.I would have like to see basic cymballs and veil. I did find this video for 12.95 at borders"

4,belly dance,"First off, I have to say, THESE ARE NOT EXERSIZE DVDs. At least, not at first. Sure, once you've learned them all and can do the dances, I suppose it is exersize. And all movement is really some kind of exersize, right? But these DVDs are not designed to help you lose weight, or even become more flexible, or whatever- they are designed to teach you how to dance belly-dance.That said, if you want to learn how to belly-dance, these are fantastic. The two dancers are great, and it starts out slow, building to more complicated moves. My only complaints- yea, the voiceover is lousy (but once you've gone through the dvd a few times to get the gist, you can turn her off) and when they put the moves together at the end, they put ALL the moves together at the end, instead of building one on another and then starting over to build another. But that's what pause and rewind are for- so if you do want to learn, this is the set to get."
1,horrible,This DVD sucks! You don't actually learn any bellydancing and the girls put you to sleep. I would say if you're having trouble going to sleep watch it. It will definitely help you fall asleep. A waste of money and time.
4,Excellent instruccions,This is a great introductory video especially for those who had never taken belly dance. The video breaks down the movements one step a time so that they are easier to master.
3,shimmy dvd,"this is ok. I like the Shimmy show on FitTv better. they are slower for the newbie which is nice as this IS a dvd to learn belly dancing. actually one of the dvds froze my laptop, messed it up for awhile. but did eventually get it out and all was fine. tried to return to vendor but no word. also took forever to arrive but then vendor was great with the communication. check out FitTV first before buying this."
5,A Great instructor of the mystic dance,"It's a very useful tool on how to get the craft of bellydancing to work. Granted you do have to practice intensively (meaning you have to watch this more than one time) but it's great to finally get some small moves down to form a great dance. At the end of each dvd you are given choreography to follow. At first I thought I couldn't remember it but surprisingly the moves are easy to follow and you do pick up speed once you have the knack for it. It's also a great workout, YOU WILL SWEAT! A keeper!"
4,A different approach to music theory and composition,"For the studied musician or composer, this book offers a new approach to the way we veiw both music theory and composition. Schenker begins with a detailed description of how we perceive music based on the natural laws of overtones. He then demonstrates how the ""old systems"", i.e. the church modes no longer, or ever really could be consisdered as independant systems of tonality. The only valid systems are the major and the minor. The first half encompasses his broad yet clarifying theories and the second half demonstrates these theories in practical applications. The concepts of ""compositional unfolding"" and many others have increased my understanding and comprehension of theory as it should be.....the way Bach, Beethoven, and many of the greats perceived it before Ramaeu. This is definetly worth the time!"
4,Foot Tapping,Saw Geno & his band in Eunice last year - been meaning to get a CD for a while (he did not have any for sale on the night) Wish I had not waited so long - its great!If you like Cajun you will like this.
5,You gotta buy this CD!!!!!,"This CD is awesome!! You gotta hear it. The best song is 'Take this Ride'. I thought their first CD ""Parts"" was good but ""Double Wide"" is even better."
3,Very sad...,"The only reason I must return it is the horrible loud high frequency humming coming from it that makes it unbearable. Other that that, it's a fine tv and I'm truly sorry I cannot stand the grating noise and keep and enjoy this tv."
5,Excellent for First Time Visitor,We went on a tour but I always buy books to help us with out travels anyways. This book is really great for first time visitors. It gives details on places that are usually visited and important traveler information. I read it on the flight and also during the trip when we were at the actually places. Good size for carrying around too.
3,Just OK,The quality of the book does not compare with many others available. Very few pictures let alone even fewer color pictures. Information is pretty helpful. However nothing really stands out.
4,"Great Travel Guide, More Useful than others, Needs Update.","I found this travel guide to Beijing to be very useful and nicely put together. Lonely planet always has nice graphics and pictures. The information was short and sweet. There was enough information to be useful, but not so much that it was overkill.As has been pointed out, the chinese characters are included which is very helpful. Also, it is true that with development being what it is in China it is impossible to write a guide that is totally up to date. Clearly, being published going on 2 years ago, this book could use an update.All that being said, this is the best guidebook to Beijing that I have seen out there. That is why I am giving it 4 stars. Happy Travels!"
2,SO SAD,"The other reviewers of this CD are far too kind (probably because they would love another great LaFaro/Evans Album) but you can not rate this album highly because the talking among the audience is far too audible. At times I checked and adjusted my stereo, only to conclude that the noise that was distracting me was on the recording."
2,Disappointing,"I recently purchased these earrings, it looked great as pictured, but was disappointed on the setting of the stone, it stands to far out from the ear when worn."
2,Sappy and predictable,"I can't believe this novel got four stars from most reviewers. I found it at times to be ridiculous and unrealistic.The narrator was a complete sap who constantly made excuses as to his rightful actions. His ex-wife was a completely unlikable bitter woman who lived a lie for years. I didn't like either one of them and at times was completely exasperated at Pete Morrison's lack of confidence.The last chapter was a complete fabrication of real life and made the whole book into a joke. Why didn't the narrator try to adopt the boy? The jerk was throwing money at him and his cold-hearted mother left and right throughout the whole book. He was constantly belittling himself and thinking he was the bad guy, when instead, he was the victim of the ex-wife's manipulation.Do yourself a favor and don't waste time on this nonsense."
1,very strange,"in the name is says 16 inches, but if you read explanatory part in says 18 inches, also it never indicate width, and the weight one point something is too small for 16/18 inches chain. i really like it, but all this smells funny. it is also says than creation method - natural, but it is can be only about stones... as i said - smells funny... you would think about something that expensive they will write carefully..."
3,It is ok...,"The book arrive earlier then expected, which is great. However, the book's cover ripped at the lower spine corner. I have to glue the cover back together. Also, there was marks and writing in the book. When I bought the book, I read the description and it does not mention about any marks, writing or tear in the book. I am very disappointed with that fact."
2,Desultory fluff,"This is by far the most desultory, fluff-filled history of biological evolution that I've ever read. Generally, I am not a skimmer of Quammen's work, and in fact often enjoy his wit and lithesome prose, but after only a dozen pages or so into Dodo I found myself flipping page after page looking for something substantive, looking for meat. In one word, the pace is SLOW. Over and over again in the margins I found myself scribbling ""Go! Go! We'd advanced this far thirty pages ago!"" But on the plus side I suppose if you are looking for a book to practice your speed reading, Dodo may be it: you can flip ten pages at a throw and hardly miss a thing."
2,I guess it wasn't for me.,"Usually I'm a nonfiction junkie, but I have to say that this book lost me. I read halfway through before finally giving up. I didn't find the writing style to be very engaging."
1,?!,"All in all not a bad book but... why did Quammen feel he had to include all the darwin bashing in the first chapter? He hints at Darwin being nothing short of a lying cheat who stole the idea of natural selection from Walace out of pride. I would not be so put off by this but he does so with little; strike that, NO evidence other than conjecture. He believes Darwin is lying about a the date he recieved Wallace's manuscript and ASSumes that Walace's account of the day he sent it (written thirty years later) was correct.Skip to MacArthur and Wilson's book. It's not that dense and its is much more impresive."
4,Good for the uneducated,I thought this was a decent book for the general population who is interested in the study of bibliography and the problems our world is facing with species extinction and loss of habitats and diversity.Read if for my 333 Biogeography class and it was very dumbed down for my education level.
5,An outsanding and important book,"Quammen's Song of the Dodo is informative, frightening and inspiring. As an undergraduate student of ecology, evolution and biogeography, I'm more than impressed by the depth of his knowledge. As a former English major with occasional flashbacks to literary pretension, I'm awed by his ability to turn these sciences into such a page-turner"
5,Islands are wonderful,"Islands are majestic and this wonderful book brings the life of Islands and thier importance to life in explaining the very key insights that led Darwin to his theory of evolution. This is agreat popular account spanning the whole world, with great depth of clarity the reader is drawn into the scientific debate regarding Wallace and his critique and rehabilitation as well as the importance of islands and the importance of the life we find on them as an ecosystem. At once this book is informative, vast and beautifully written."
4,A Challenging Read,"On the one hand, I've tried reading this book three times and always run out of gas around page 150. On the other hand, I have tried three times. This is an important and engaging book, and the island biogeography ideas are important when trying to understand ecosystem destruction within North America. Eventually I will finish the book!"
5,sex after 50,"A helpful and fun read for us over ""50's +. :-) Never too old to learn something again or new."
1,Too much God and religion for me,"I did not realize this book was directed towards Christian, married sex. If you are then you might enjoy it. I was turned off early by biblical references and ""god"" approved sexual relations."
1,Should never have been released to the public,"From the opening bars, this recording of the Planets was a disappointment. The brass playing is sub-par in both Mars and Uranus. That the trumpets add a misplayed note to one of the more signifigant passages early in Mars and this is just not acceptable. I am surprised that EMI ever allowed such a recording to be released to the public. Such playing is not even worthy of budget releases and there are good number of budget releases that are better than this. There are better Boult recordings of The Planets and I think had this disc not had Boult's name on it, it probably would never again have seen the light of day."
1,false advertising,This isn't the product you get.....the greenhouse isn't 10' tall it's 6' and it isn't the metalic color shown in the pic.......it's green and it doesn't have a decorative trianglular top.......the real one doesn't even have a top. It doesn't weigh near what they show on here and it looks cheap and flimsy. I have already contacted ace and amazon. I don't want to pay the return shipping. Fair warning.......it's not worth the price
5,The only book you'll ever need,"This authoritative new edition on the design & application of centrifugal pumps should be in the hands of EVERY engineer, designer, student and pump user in the world. The late Val S. Lobanoff was a genius in centrifugal pump design and his technical papers are an asset to every pump designer in the world."
5,mining the Serenity prayer,"For more than three decades Ihave been saying this prayer, often as a mantra, but until I read this book Ihad not fully understood what I was praying for................particularly useful to me sections about pain. In the lst 5 years I have had 3 orthapaedic surgeries. Now i know pain is not me and can continue to work my program without a timeout for self pity."
4,thoughtful and provacative,"As a fan of Victoria Bronworth's writing and a lesbian with a disability, this anthology is not only long-overdue, it is compelling and diverse. It includes essays from women with all disabilities including mental, AIDS and CFIDS, as well as different backgrounds and perspectives."
5,What a gorgeous thing!,Play this. Enjoy this. It will simultaneously soothe and uplift you. A beautiful recording of this heavenly piece. One of the nicest things about this CD is that the Faure is the sole piece on it. Trying to follow this Requiem with anything else would be senseless.
2,Unbelievably slow,"Having just finished singing the Requiem with the Syracuse Oratorio Society, I bought this eagerly, loving the music. But this version sounds like it's got a lead weight around its leg. The unbelievably slow tempi make this much more dirgelike, even in the bright shining passages. A real disappointment."
2,lasted 4 years,"I bought this TV in 2004 from Best Buy and it crapped out in 2008. White horizontal lines appeared at the top of the screen. If a persons head was shown on screen near the top, the white lines reflected an upside down image of the top of the head. I ran this TV all night while I slept but I still expected it to last more than 4 years, preferably 10. Everything looked good before the white lines appeared. Giving it only 2 stars for the durability. I'd rather not buy a new TV every 4 years."
1,electrica hum from back of unit,The television is a nice small size so perfect for a bedroom but the television makes an electrical hum from the back of the unit. The hum just drives me nuts. I thought this might be a defective unit but others have commented on this problem with last year's model. So looks like they have not fixed this issue.
4,Great TV,"Awesome clarity and sound and the price gives it the best bang for the buck. Although the remote control is a little awkward... 99% of the time I'll be staring at the TV and not the remote so it isn't that much of a problem. I have indeed heard the infamous humming noise from the back of the TV, it is a little annoying but I have gotten use to it plus it can only be heard when the sound is on low or mute. Overall I couldn't be happier and this is coming from a college student."
4,Good TV good price,"About the humming--Some SONY units also have the humming noise and my JVC 27"" flat screen also has the humming. It is annoying but the price to pay for a quality TV."
4,Great Book - If you like Stephen King - you'll like this,"Absolutely a page turner of a book. Great story that just keeps moving faster and faster. A classic good versus evil that keeps you on the edge till the end. If you like Stephen King, you'll love this."
4,ok,Estoy contento con mi compra.Es un producto nuevo de buena calidad y de una marca prestigiosa.Saludos y gracias
1,A grave disappointment; stick to the earlier ones,"I bought this book expecting more of what Alpern has covered in his previous books: more buildings, with more stories, and more floor plans. Instead, while some material is new, quite a few of these buildings have been covered in his earlier books. And there are no floor plans at all. If you are an afficionado of great Manhattan apartment houses, avoid this book and stick with ""New York's Fabulous Luxury Apartments"" instead."
5,"""It's the wish-a-wisher...","...she's a kill-a-killer.""I LOVE it, As good a watch as a Tim Burton movie, or the Addam's Family, or even a Vincent Price film. Colorful and witty and wonderfully morbid. Can't wait for the new season."
5,Gothic Fairy Tale For This Generation,"If you like Tim Burton, or even if you don't, this show has a very fairy tale feel to it. The colors are bright and beautiful, the actors are charming, and the plot is very creative. This show is very much a gothic fairy tale. It is both uplifting and tragic at the same time. Check it out, you won't regret it!"
5,:):):):),"I absolutely loved the first Season of Pushing Daisies!Some words to sum it up, cute quirky, and unbelievable yet some how realistic....!I don't typically watch television, because 1 I don't really have the time, and 2 most of the tv shows on today are so similar is plot line and topic that it begins to be cliche ;) The title and cover photo are what pulled me in to this show. I will say with confidence, this is the most entertaining, captivating and creative tv show I have ever seen!"
5,Excellent!,"The show is magical, brief, and a little gem that didn't get the airtime it deserved. I love it and can watch it over and over again."
3,daisies,"the package came sooner than expected. the shows ok, but i bought it more for my wife that loves the show after seeing some at my daughter's apartment when they watched her dvd."
2,Too cute.,"Based on the unanimous praise on Amazon, I was really looking forward to this DVD, but frankly, it just didn't work for me. The premise was interesting, the visuals were good (somewhat Tim Burton-esque as another reviewer noted), and the actors were fine. The problem: the writing was just way, way, WAY too precious and cutesy for me. If you, like me, are the kind of curmudgeon who generally doesn't like precious and cutesy but wonders, based on the uniformly great reviews, whether this DVD might be whimsical and likeable rather than cloying and saccharine, I guess my role is to warn you that you may be disappointed."
1,Horribly bad!,"This is horrible! It is badly written and has bad actors. Do not waste your time or money on this crap. I ordered this and the big bang theory and chuck and the only reason that i am not mad at how bad this is, is because of how good the others were so, dont order this go get The Big Bang Theory and Chuck."
5,"A show before it's time, or on the wrong channel","Either this show was before it's time, or it was on the wrong channel, because this was a quirky classic."
5,Pushing Daisies is Wonderful,"I love this show, more than I have ever loved any other show. It's the perfect combination of idealism and dark humor. Pies, bees, love, and dead people. What could be more perfect? Not only that, but the colors (and the clothes) make watching the show as delicious as...eating a 3 Plum Pie. Vivid and lively, from the scenery to the clothes to the plotlines, this show is wonderful--absolutely perfect. Because it's so out of the ordinary, though, I'm afraid that not enough people will watch it (it IS a bit bizarre). But hopefully Pushing Daisies will be the show to change how the world works. Hopefully something beautiful will win out (for once) over the bland colloquial (a.k.a those disgusting things we call ""reality"" T.V. shows)."
3,not what i expected but close enough,"I cannot completely say that this is a waste of my money but i was expecting more of a blue ray disc, at least beautiful menus and Spanish subtitles, it's a blue ray and it has lots of space, so...Also, there are no subtitle style options; they are white and quite difficult to see sometimes. My boyfriend is deaf and subtitles are very important for him and the ones in this set are a disappointment.At least the picture quality is awesome and the sound is good."
5,Awesomeness with a whipped cream topping,"I bought this ages ago and loaned it to someone who never gave it back to me, so when I saw this on sale, I had to snatch it up. It showed up rather quickly and I started watching it immediately, quickly followed by season 2 and then watched Wonderfalls which was made by the same brilliant mind that created this magic. If you haven't watched this show, just buy it, and watch it, you'll love it."
4,"Good Price, Good Gift","I bought the first season for a friend for Christmas. The price was great, $5-$12 cheaper than the stores I went to. Gift was shipped here in plenty of time to be wrapped."
5,I hate it that this MARVELOUS show was cancelled!!!,I absolutely love this series & this is a great season box set. If you are NOT in love with the Pie Maker at the beginning you will definitely be by the end!!!!
5,Best Show EVER!!!,"Heartbreaking to see that ABC cancelled this magical, cute, quirky, romantic, hilarious, heartwarming show. I cannot believe that they still keep some stupid shows, but get rid of something so entertaining.This is a show that everyone, from young to old can watch and enjoy!! Bryan Fuller has such a brilliant mind to put these incredible characters together and come up with something magical and unique.I really enjoy watching Pushing Daisies and pray for a miracle that the show will be picked up by another network."
5,Cute and quirky,"I love this show! It's very cute, original, fun, and quirky. I am very disappointed that ABC is not renewing the show. I hope another channel picks them up. The writing and the actors are so brilliant!"
5,A gem of a show,"Pushing Daisies is whimsical, funny and incredible fun to watch. Every episode will leave you with a smile on your face."
2,Not as good as others,"I ordered these naively thinking they would taste the same as any other crystallized ginger. I mean, they only have two ingredients, right? Wrong, these were weirdly like gummy bears instead of chewy and they had very inconsistent flavor. The whole first bag tasted like some one dumped a flowery cologne in it. I much prefer the Reeds brand to this and am going back to them as soon as I finish my case-ugh!"
2,Inconsistent Quality,"I didn't purchase this from Amazon although I was about to since the 12 pack is so much cheaper than buying individual bags at the grocery store. So I thought I'd try a couple of bags to see how I liked them. The first bag was wonderful - plump, sweet, juicy pieces of ginger. Nicely sweetened with a good, hot ginger hit. The second bag was awful - mushy ginger and some pieces with strange unnatural textures. And the ginger was way too hot in that second bag.Not sure what's going on. But I also tried a couple of bags of the Reed's and liked their ginger much, much better. And the quality was consistent."
5,Excellent Stretch - and not just for beginners,"I'm an intermediate exerciser and really enjoyed this tape. I just started doing yoga a year ago and yoga can sometimes be strenuous. You don't have to psych yourself up for this tape. The stretches are easy to do and Tamilee points out modifications throughout the tape. Each 10 min. section stretches out your entire body. Obviously, you get different stretches in each section - standing is first, then sitting in a chair then floor stretches. I usually do one section at a time. It's great for cooling down after cardio or weights. It's also perfect to do at night before bedtime. Though the title says it's for beginners - I think all levels will benefit from this tape."
3,GREAT STRETCH!,This video really helped improve my flexibility! I'm a dancer and this helped me alot! I highly reccomend it! :-)
5,A unique perspective,This book provides a unique perspective on the training of Phillip Starr that I have found in no other book on Martial Arts in 40 years of training and study. It talks to the heart of the old way of training both physically and mentally. This is an exceptional real life story of training and dedication of the student and teacher. It is the best book I have read on what it takes to be a master practitioner and teacher.Rick Jacobsen
5,Excellent and Encouraging,"The book is a well written piece. The stories centered around the interaction between Chen and Sifu Starr are reminiscent of the insightful interaction that Sifu Starr shares with his current students. I highly recommend this book to the serious martial artist whether they practice kung-fu, karate, judo, etc. We all have one thing in common--we train in order to understand what it truly means to be virtuous.Vincent Hardy"
5,Wonderful Insight,I adored this book. Every story is a lesson in life and can be read again and again. This is a book I keep by my bedside.
3,I prefer musicality over technical brilliance,"Listening to Lipatti is like watching a car race. He plays so fast, I can't really hear the music. He is technically brilliant - no doubt about it, but I don't hear any soul when I listen to him play these waltzes. When I listen to Rubinstein, I seldom notice his technique (which is also amazing) because I am so captivated by the music."
1,Not what I ordered,"I requested the 10th edition of Business Research Methods. My purchase stated I would be receiving the 10th edition as ordered. The pic of the 10th edition cover was connected to my cart and my purchase; HOWEVER, I received the 7th edition. This was not accepted in the Master's level class I purchased this book for. I attempted to contact Amazon about this and they sent me an email address to request a refund/return from the seller. I emailed the seller nearly 6 weeks ago and have still not heard a word from them. Unless the situation is rectified, I will never purchase from this seller again. At this point, I would not trust you were receiving the correct product if you order from them. I hope they change my mind for future purchases."
5,MARCH FANS HAVE SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT,"IF YOUR LOOKING FOR SOMETHING THAT ANY TRAIN FAN, OR MARCH FAN WILL ENJOY, THAN THIS DISC IS FOR YOU. THE PERFORMANCE IS ENERGETIC AND STRONG. THE DISC FEATURES MORE THAN ENOUGH MUSIC TO KEEP YOUR NEIGHBORS BANGING ON YOUR DOOR TO QUIET DOWN. GREAT LINER NOTES FROM A MORE HISTORICAL POINT OF VIEW. A MUST FOR TRAIN LOVERS. TOTALLY ENJOYABLE FOR THE ENTIRE FAMILY."
3,Work Out #2 is physically impossible for me to do,"I am in pretty good shape so I am not really sure why certain positions are so hard for me to do. Work out #1 is very good, but after 2 weeks I wanted to do a longer ab workout. I found I physically could not do many of the routines in #2. So I am little disappointed that all I have is a 15 minute ab work out. I love the other vidoes in the series, but I think I am going to look for another Tamille ab work out."
3,Great for beginners,"This video is okay if don't want something too intense. I prefer a workout where I can really feel the burn and this one just didn't do it for me. I do think, however, that this is a great video for beginners."
5,Great ab workout.,"This is a great, intense, and short workout. I work my abs every day and this one you feel. I would recommend it to all who are working on shrinking the ab area."
5,1 week=Results,"After using this for just one week, workout 1 has made my upper abs firmer and stronger. This tape is awesome and I recomend it to everyone!"
2,ehh,Not exactly what I was expecting but it was cheap and not totally out of date. Take up space words.
5,Great!,Fast shipping! I ordered 5 books on the same day from different sellers and I recieve theirs first! The book was also great condition like they had said. Thanks!
5,Great deal,The book was in wonderful shape and the delivery was quick. Great doing business with this company.
5,Great Price - Great Product,I have had this product for quite some time now and it has not rusted nor has it collected dirt or no such thing that other products usually do.
3,No additional Outfits,"This doll is definitely soft and fairly cute. My daughter likes her overall which is what counts...right? Well, I guess she like it enough that the outfit that the doll came in is starting to look a little worn. Instead of buying another/alternate doll for X-Mas which is probably pretty common, I thought I could just freshen up the current doll with a couple new outfits. I was also hoping that my 3 yr. old could learn some patience and practice motor skills via changing outfits. So far I have had no luck. I've looked everywhere and the only option I see is to purchase another doll...hmmm, am I missing something here????"
4,Nice Cushion and warmth,"Not a bad pair of socks, kept my feet somewhat dry when coupled with good shoes. Nice cushion on the soles which felt fine after 10 miles."
4,"Pricey, but Comfy","Back in the day, I would just buy a bag of cheap tube socks and run in them until they disintegrated. I also ate Ramen noodles. After winning a pair of nice running socks, I was sold on the higher quality and have stuck with them ever since.I bought this particular socks because I had a $10 credit and needed a pair of socks quickly. While they are pricey, they did prove to be comfortable. I haven't used them enough to determine how long lasting they are, but based on the quality, I would be surprised if they did not endure reasonably well."
4,Rave Speakers,"I looked at all my options for bookshelf speakers, as everyone does. I didn't want to pay more then 100$ for a pair. The bass responce for these speakers is pretty good, except when turned up loud and getting more power then they can handle. I would recomend these speakers to anyone who wants affordable, portable, and good sounding speakers."
4,A Good Work.,The album is reflective of his work in the 80's in the smooth jazz genre. Maybe a bit too typical of the era but all in all I enjoyed it.
1,Don't Buy This Book!!,"I used the REA prep-books for the MTEL Communication/Literacy and the MTEL Middle School Mathematics and overall these were pretty good, however, this MTEL General Curriculum prep-book by REA is aweful!The History and Child Psychology sections do okay at giving over a short summary of the content of these sub-areas, but the Language Arts, Math and Science sections mostly just explains what is on the MTEL so you know what to study, rather than giving over the ""cliffnotes"" of this information. So this book is pretty useless for these later topics.Some of my friends have recommended ""What Every 5th Grader Needs to Know,"" and ""What Every 6th Grader Needs to Know."" Why both I'm not sure; I haven't looked at them yet."
2,Focus on Universities,"I was disappointed in this book. I assumed that the author would draw on a wealth of experience as the provider of Blackboard, the most common software for e-learning. Instead, the book was mostly an apologetic for why ""brick and mortar"" universities are superior to e-learning, and how they can add some e-learning features to maintain their dominance in the educational realm by becoming ""brick and click"" schools. The book does include some helpful facts and statistics, but I had hoped to find more than that. I was seeking creative ways to improve and develop e-learning. It didn't find that. The book might be helpful for some educators who are interesting tweaking the traditional university model, but not for people who are interested in more significant change."
2,"Lots of Theory, Little Know How","Matthew Pittinsky has published the slightly stale presentations and speeches that educators and theorists delivered several years ago. What might have seemed like cutting edge thinking at that time is now missing the boat for the most part. Higher education is still grappling with how to deal with what has become a buyers' market for education. Faculty, who are stuck in the paradigm of a sellers' market and protected by the cloak of tenure, are the critical players in the e-learning scenario. Pittinsky hasn't found an answer to the real problem: who will hold faculty responsible for the fiscal strength and market share of higher education? As in so many instances, online learning has crystallized the issues of who teaches, who learns, and the bottom line for strong and productive higher education institutions."
5,Networks in Higher Education!,Wired and wireless! This book discusses network technology in colleges and university. It is written for educators and decision makers. It provides a base level of technical understand and explains important concepts necessary to decision making. This text helps decision makers and educators set realistic goals for technology that will ultimately help with adoption.
5,Onward down the Path,The Path's new video looks as interesting as the Path: Afterlife. The Path: Beyond the Physical looks to be a great connection between the first series of the Path and to take another step into our real purpose here on Earth. We all have some connection to what these experts are saying and need to explore what our true energy focus should be. We should all know that energy is borrowed and while we are riding the wave we need to find the curl and ride to the end of the tunnel as smoothly as possible until the energy we have is released. Peace to all and don't forget to wax your board!!!
2,there was no real valuable information,"Just finished watching this documentary, I have always been interested in immortally out of body experiences and life after death so I was excited to watch this movieI was extremely disappointed, besides Thomas Campbell's information there was no real valuable information, the rest of the teachers gave nothing of value or information you can think and develop with, it felt like a mediocre TV show. Nothing new or valuableI would however recommend this as a gift for people that are going through a grieving process it can help comfort them."
5,Darn good.,"This book looks at gender and race and their impacts on social reform during the New Deal. An excellent history, it has won a regional award."
4,Great source,"Fot those who are searching a good resource to write about feminism and femal art it's a great book. Paglia provides you her point of view about women and her position in the western society, comparing to primarly and eastern ones."
5,The Book of the Nineties,"Paglia's biologically-rooted world-view was so out of fashion during the Seventies and Eighties that this super-verbalist only managed to get two (!) articles published before she turned 40. Thus, this book was a massive surprise, synthesizing a quarter century of novel and brilliant thinking. The supremely lucid first chapter might be the most quotable essay of our age.Since 1990, she's devoted more efforts to becoming a pundit and a celebrity than to continuing this work into the 20th century, but we still have this one extraordinary book. -- Steve Sailer"
1,Depressing,"That fact that some people describe a misogynistic & unoriginal crackpot like Camille Paglia as ""brilliant"" is utterly depressing. This woman is Rush Limbaugh's soul mate."
1,Sexual Personae,"This book is not worth the paper it was written on, nor the ink it was typed with, unless one is an extremely narrow-minded misogynist."
5,Book,"Barbara Metzger is the best. Good story line, humor, no trash and lovely to read electronically. reasonable price, will buy again."
5,A Terrific Single,"And even better considering the Tennant/Lowe partnership was in the latter part of its second decade at the time of this release. Miracles is, in its seven and twelve inch formats, a very touching love song with a sentimental lyric, a great melody and typically lush PSB instrumentation and production. It sways very gently. But it's the thunderous Eric Pryz remix ( exclusive here ) that really got me hooked and ultimately led to my purchase of this Japanese import. Seven-plus minutes of pure electro-house bliss."
3,"PSB can still work ""Miracles""","I have mixed feelings about this single...the song ""Miracles"" is one of their best and is almost worth the price of the single. ""We're the Pet Shop Boys"" has a good beat, but, like the mixes and ""Transparent,"" it gets boring after a while if you listen to it a lot. The only other song I find myself listening to a lot is the 12"" version (labeled as the ""extended mix"" on the British and American releases), which is a very well done extended version.""Miracles"" is a good single, but I don't think it's worth the price that it is."
5,The joyfulest choral ever heard,"Never on earth a melody dedicated to joy and love between men has fulfilled his goal better than in Wilhelm Furtwangler's Beethoven's Ninth Symphony performance. All shades of human feelings pass through our hearts from the first to the last movement, reaching the blissful and lofty representation of cheerfulness at the end of the 4th. Listening to this record for the first time, early in my life (I am now just 31 years old), the feelings aroused by the melody surpassed the hearing sense, making me feel I was watching joy straight before me... red and yellow sparks disseminated from all the sound environment making such a scene of blissful delight, unforgettable.I should admit I am utterly fond of Karajan performances, but just for once in my life am I forced to acknowledge other's performance was the best.Sure I am, if such the case Beethoven being alive, he would listen to this record over and over"
3,mediocre,"The orchestra seems to fight the tempo throughout the whole piece, which is a little bit disappointing for an ensemble of this quality. In particular, the third movement in general seem to lag. In the finale, the Solo quartet is good, but better exist. The ending of the finale ending is so fast the brass can't keep up. It is really quite ridiculous. I'd go with Gardiner or Karajan's editions before this one, but that's just me."
1,And now for something completely different...,"I realise that I might be the only person who feels this way about this recording. I do love Beethoven and his 9th, but for me this version is way too slow. I blame it on Wagner. It seems that after his influence, many conductors felt it necessary to make their interpretations grand and majestic. For me, it ends up sounding fat and bloated. My personal preference is George Szell leading the Cleveland Orchestra. Even though it is on Sony's budget label it has more life than this turgid, plodding rendition."
1,NOT good at all . . . Really.,Just 2 listenings and that's enough already! . . . This interpretation seriously lacks emotion and energy. My listening was distracted very quickly . . . The playing lacks purpose. The main content/spirit is taken away from the music by slowing it down so much that the meaning is lost . . . Please try something like Roger Norrington's symphony box set from here and you'll be 'shocked' at how Beethoven can hit you with emotion & energy.
1,"Distorted, misinterpreted and strangest 9th.","This is a performance worthless except for the people who sympathize with a tragic conductor named Furtwängler. I wonder if it was really ""joy"" of the conductor, who had conducted Meistersinger in Bayreuth for Nazi during the war, to conduct the 9th in the concert that was held in commemoration of the restart of the Bayreuth festival after the war. This is one of the distorted, misinterpreted and strangest 9th, even if I purely listen to it as music separating politics."
2,Much better out there.,"People have already written some good comments about this. I'm really only adding because I hate to see so many 5s on a considerably less-than-enjoyable recording of Beethoven's 9th. It seems to come down to this: if you're someone who puts, what...the conductor 'aura/persona' high, you might like it because of the history behind this recording and Furtwangler's unique idiom. If you just want a good recording of the 9th, however, look elsewhere. George Szell's is a particular favorite of mine, but at any rate, there are many out there that better deserve 5s from those only interested in the music!Actually, this recording reminds me of the only concert I've ever nearly walked out of: ironically, a Beethoven's 9th concert at the National Basilica of the Shrine of the Immaculate Conception. The acoustics were so AWFUL, that it was only out of respect and decorum that I stayed at all."
2,Knew I was taking a chance....,"I am VERY picky about my fuzzy socks. I have only found a few I like. The problem with these is that, although they are probably fantastic to sleep in because they are comfortable, my feet slide all around in them if I'm wearing them around the house. They are slippery, not sliding on the floor, but between my feet and the sock. Makes walking difficult. I would wear thick socks like this in the winter in my crocs around the house in case you are wondering under what circumstances anyone would walk around in these... If I used them only while I am on the sofa crocheting or watching TV they would be great."
3,Fuzzy pile got matted down after about 5 wears,"These are super comfy and very fluffy, and like someone said, the seams are nice and they stay up too. My big problem is that after wearing about 5 times, the fuzzy part is completely flat/matted down on the bottom (sole) now, and no amount of washing, brushing or fabric softener will return them to their former glory."
1,Expensive and low quality or quality control,We received these today and when I saw my wife she was sewing one sock because it had a hole about the size of a dime. That is ridiculous for socks that cost this much.We will have to see if they last since they were sewn now.I would not order again and I do realize that there are problems with anything.
2,Extremely thin,"I was hoping these would be plush and thick because I just wanted to wear them around the house to keep my feet warm in the winter, but they're really, really thin and therefore seem a little cheap and don't keep my feet that warm. They are soft, though, so... there's that?"
2,Good socks - uber expensive,"No complaints whatsoever about the product, these are very quality socks. But, this price is for one pair of socks; I repeat one pair of socks. $12 is extremely too much for one pair of socks. The product page and description is very deceiving as well. It is not mentioned anywhere on the page that the price is for only one pair, and the picture displays four pairs of socks. I mean seriously, WTF"
1,Cold Socks,I ordered these socks based on reviews saying they keep your feet warm. It is about 20 degrees throughout the winter where I live. I put these socks on at night and I might as well not have been wearing anything. My feet were just as cold without them.
4,Great socks,These socks are great warm but not ultra heavy and really soft. I will be ordering more as I hate being cold
2,If your looking for cheapo socks...,"These socks scream cheap. The material is so thin they are almost laughable, and as noted earlier, if you have capret they shed, and on anything slick, you may as well be on ice. I will find some better made socks."
3,Cozy but easy to tear,"Very soft and cozy socks and the color is nice (I got the olive green), but they developed a hole the first day I wore them. I did not subject them to anything more than the normal wear and tear expected of wearing socks around the house."
5,Awesome socks!,"I ordered these socks for my husband for the holidays. Size is perfect. They are soft, lightweight, and keep his feet warm in the evenings. It was hard to find ""manly"" fuzzy socks, but these are right on target. Highly recommend these for anyone wanting soft, fuzzy, warm but lightweight house socks!"
5,I love these fuzzy socks!,These are really great socks! They wash/dry well with no shrinkage and retain their bright colors. They are soooo soft. I have chronic pain and these socks help very much to keep me comfy and happy. I bought five and will be buying a lot more to wear around the house with no shoes.
3,Not so HOT,"I got this product because it was advertised to be heavy duty & I have long hair. It's a ceramic hair dryer & seemed to have a good customer rating. It gets warm at best on ther high setting & takes me almost 45 minutes to blow my hair DAMP. It just doesn't have the air blowing power for the wattage it advertises. Giving it a 3 is generous. The item was also scratched up cosmetically plus it's heavy & awkward to hold. Might be good for real short hair, but generally not the best pea in the pod. I don't recommend it. The seller did package it for shipping well though."
5,must be seen to be believed,"Of all projection TV's (not counting the DLP's), this is THE best one. Bestby carries this model, and when seeing all the dark projectors around it, you'll say: ""is that a projection??"" It looks like a tube, it's that bright. I'm currently not in the market myself, otherwise I'd get this thing in a heartbeat for that price.One caveat: Glossy Screen. It looks better at night, but daytime TV just isn't as glorious."
1,Incredibly pathetic service from TOSHIBA,"The TV is great!, terrific!, but then I tried to get a stand!! The recommended ST4663. Got three weeks of runaround from the Toshiba website who claim to send you to their accessories department, which turns out to be a small parts store!. The Toshiba Customer Assistance person anded up doing a ""Google"" search because SHE had no idea of where to get it AND couldn't offer any alternative or help!I would NEVER buy Toshiba again if this is the best they can do!"
4,TV MANIA,"I shopped around for a TV that was 46"" and rear projection for a long time. I found that brand recognition was not as bad as I initiatially had thought that it was. I've had a small ""Toshib"",and I call it that 'cause the letter fell off quite some time ago, but the fact that this tv still goes on is amazing. This TV has been in my house for at least 12 plus years. So, I think that this brand is invariably outstanding. My ""Toshib"" still plays,while my ""Toshib"" has lines across the top of the screen. I admit, there are a few set out there that beat this Toshiba, but my new Toshiba Widescreen TV is really nice!!!!!!!!!! and all the worth of a dollar spent."
5,Excellent!,"Not much to say - it's a pic holder that attaches to a music/mic stand and holds pics.As advertised, it does indeed attach nicely and easily and snugly to my music/mic stands, and it does, in fact, snuggly and easily hold pics.Well worth the small cost."
4,Finest performance of Dvorak Dumky Trio I've yet heard,"I'm going through a thing for the Dvorak Trios right now and ran across this CD, which I highly recommend. The performance is very musical and imaginative -- the sisters take pauses and bend the tempos to really good effect, the playing is emotional and, for the most part (the violinist is good but not great), technically very sound. In fact, the sisters manage to make this Trio a little bit less stodgy than I thought prior to hearing the performance (it's not as strong a piece as the Op 26 or Op 65 trios, IMHO). This is high praise.The performances are excellent throughout but I'm not giving it 5 stars because I think the two other pieces on the CD -- a Suk Elegy and Shostakovich's disappointing 1st Trio -- are not up to the caliber of the Dumky Trio."
5,great tv,"this is a great tv, great picture, great sound. i did online research before buying this box, and it seems this is the best crt box 25"" and smaller. but it was walking into best buy, and seeing this box for myself, sitting next many others like sony and panasonic, that i knew this one was the one...."
3,Who's Diamante?,"I listened to this cd and I thought it was ""alright"". The girl, Diamante has so much potential! I've never heard of her but I hope she continues....maybe on her own."
5,I keep this book with me,"I may eventually buy another copy of this book to keep in my car. My current copy sits where I spend most of my waking time: working at the computer. It sits at the base of my monitor, within easy reach. I pick it up SO often - just to remind myself of what I need at the moment. Chock full of short, spot on spiritual ""hits."""
5,PERFECT dresser sized TV,"I am in a small apartment now and until I find a house I didn't want to add to my A/V equipment...due to murphy's law my Sharp 13"" I have for several years died (remote fetched $20 on ebay though :) ).This TV would have to sit on the dresser....16.5"" deep was the most room I had.The Toshiba fits perfect...I wish I could have gotten the 20"" or 24"", but this works out good. There are a ton of video inputs and outputs, sound quality is good and the picture outstanding. This will make the perfect kitchen TV once I have the house situated.The screen is flat as can be and the remote glows in the dark for a long time after the lights go out (not as nice as the actual lighted one from my Toshiba CX32G60 from 1997 which still works perfectly, but definitely does the job).The price, combined with free shipping and $50 in amazon coupons I earned christmas shopping here made it a STEAL, it's $170-190 everywhere here. My price less than $100!"
2,Agree with not my cup of tea reviewer,I bought this DVD with high hopes and expectations after reading the mostly rave reviews. I have to say I was really disappointed. I have been doing all six workouts every day for 12 days and they leave me feeling like something is missing. I find the routines very dull and have to turn down the volume and listen to my own music. After doing this workout I have to do something energetic and find the Kathy Smith Kick boxing workout the best way of getting a great all over workout. This is probably a good toning workout for people just starting out on exercise routines. My copy of this DVD is scheduled for donation to my public library.
4,very good workout,The exercises are great. The warm-ups are silly in a typical way. The stretching is inadequate. So I warm up on my own for 10 minutes. Then I do one 15-minute segment of each body area (in a different order than on the DVD) and then I stretch on my own for 10 minutes. I fast forward through Tamilee's warm-ups and stretching. It's an hour well spent.
2,Disappointment,"After reading the reviews here I thought this would be a great, quick and to the point workout, but that is definitely not the case. Typically I do the video after already having done cardio so was very irritated to find a long cardio workout before the ab exercises began. Also she spends too much time giving instructions for each exercise, I found myself wishing she would just hurry up the whole time. I also bought the 8 minute video series and maybe that is why this one is so disappointing. I recommend buying 8 minute ab if you are in a hurry and don't want to deal with an annoying instructor!"
1,not very good,"I purchased this dvd because of the reviews i read on amazon.com. SORRY I did that. Tamilee acts like we all have bodies like her now. She goes to fast and even though there are 3 different workouts, one for arms, abs and buns, you can't chose to do three in a row. You can do one and then go out and chose another and so on. It is just too much trouble and time consuming to workout with her. Not to mention the poor quality. This dvd sucks in my opinion. I hate that I wasted my money on this.Sorry Tamilee but you don't get my vote on this dvd."
2,1 on 1 Training,"We all know that Tamilee has that body. Didn't expect her to be the only body in the video. I am more for a group atmosphere. So in that regard, I pass on this video. Maybe next time Tami...."
1,Poor Quality DVD - Don't waste your money,"I was very excited after reading reviews on this DVD, however, once I received it I was very disappointed. It is extremely POOR QUALITY. The DVD hung and skipped numberous times, the picture isn't clear, and all in all, it's cheesy.Don't waste your money."
4,An oldie but a goodie,"I've had this dvd for 4 or 5 years and its one I keep coming back to. If it had some exercises for chest and back it would be perfect. (Which is why it only gets 4, instead of 5 stars from me). As it is, a great workout that you can mix and match to make it as tough as you want. The exercises are solid and Tamilee really knows her stuff. Definitely a classic you should have in your exercise library."
5,schmocas,Tamilee is the best instructor! She kicked my butt into shape when I was 25 and now she kicking it again at 43. I have only done the workouts for 3 weeks and already am seeing results. LOVE HER!
3,not an improvement,"I bought this because I used to use a videotape version that I really liked. It had two complete programs with warm up and then legs, arms, and abs all in a row. It was much more convenient to use. With this, each is a separate workout with separate warm up. It's a hassle having to jump around and fast forward through parts I don't need. Plus, some of the workouts are longer, so it's more skipping. I wish the dvd had been done the same as the video, and then added other parts on that could be skipped to, if I wanted. However, I like the exercises, and Tamilee's voice and instruction, although for a tape that will be used over and over, she talks a little too much. Too bad there isn't a way to keep the music but blot out the voice for those of us doing the program for the 20th time!"
5,You'll know you've worked out!,"I lift 2 times a week and kickbox 2 or 3 times a week, but every time I do this workout I feel the aftereffects for 2 days afterwards. It's a very hard, effective workout. The only con is the cheesy music.It's segmented so I sometimes use only portions along with my regular weight routine.Buy the video-you won't be disappointed!"
5,Best Ab Workout,"I found the 2nd Ab program to be the most challenging ab workout I've ever come across. In just 15 mns my abs are exausted and feel great. This video is worth the money just for that ab workout. I also think it's super cool that she brought all of these workouts into the lab and tested how hard they worked the muscles they were targeting. So she only includes exercises that tested high in the lab, so you don't have to worry about wasting your time with less effective exercises. Therefore you can be confident that you are working your muscles very hard for a short amount of time. Why waste time doing a longer workout that includes less effective exercises??? I love this video - and my fiance could see the difference in my abs after a couple weeks (I do the ab workout 2 to 3 times a week.)"
4,Pretty Good,"This video concentrates on abs, legs, and arms. Arms and Abs are a good workout, legs is good except one will grow out of it real quick. Add ankle weights to it, and it bumps it up a level. Overall, its good. Always been a fan of Tamilee. Her old Thighs of Steel is more challenging and longer."
5,LOVE THIS WORKOUT DVD!!!,"I bought this DVD the other month and I absolutely love it! I use it in conjunction with other work out tapes that I use. The practical thing about this workout DVD is that the workouts are only about 15 minutes each, so if I do not have time to do a 50 minute cardio workout, I simply pop this disc in. Each body part (abs, arms, buns) has 2 different workouts so that you won't get bored doing the same workout over and over again. I always feel the results as I am working out - as well as the next day!! I totally reccommend this DVD to anyone who is looking to add to their at-home workout routine!"
4,Difficult,"This one is a little more advanced than some of the 'of steel' DVD's. It is great for those that have mastered the abs and buns of steel, easy to follow and very fast paced."
2,I don't want her body,"Tamilee has some good videos, but this one did not do it for me....she seems so fake, and the workouts were rather bland. i did not care for it at all....PLUS, I do not want my body to look as disproportionate as hers, it's not something I aspire to achieve.....not worth it."
5,A Treasure for Your Workout DVD Collection!!,"I recently purchased this DVD just to give my workout routine a change. I already do cardio so I wanted something for sculpting. THIS DVD INCLUDES 6 WORKOUTS...15 MINUTES EACH...ABS, ABS 2, ARMS, ARMS 2, BUNS, AND BUNS 2!! I haven't moved up to the level 2's yet. But, let me tell you...YOU WILL FEEL THE DIFFERENCE THAT SAME DAY AND THE NEXT DAY YOU'LL BE BURNIN WHEN YOU GO TO SIT ON THE TOILET!! THIS IS SERIOUS WORK!! I do abs,arms, and buns in a row. They are 15 minutes each and when you're done with each section you're so proud you got thru it!! This DVD I would recommend for Intermediates or Advanced Level People!! BUY IT NOW!! YOUR BODY WILL THANK YOU FOR IT!! =)"
4,"Good overall, but a bit short on ab work","This tape is great if you only have a few minutes a day (a week?) to spend on fitness. I worked up a good sweat doing it and even had to pause a lot during the second 15 minute workout to huff and puff. I was pretty sore the next day. I wish the ab portion had been longer though, but that's okay. I got her ""I want those abs"" tape and it looks really tough!"
5,I want that Body!,"I am thrilled to see an Fitness Expert, Tamilee Webb share how I can help shape my body, even over 40, as she was over 40 when making this DVD workout. Its wonderful to see her even after 20 plus years still have the strength and shape she does. She encourages me and has helped my body get back in shape even after menopause!! Her Master's degree in Exercise Science definitely pays off!!!! THANKS TAMILEE FOR HELPING THIS 40 plus year old with my arms, abs, and buns in this DVD. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO ALL!!! P.S. even my daughter in her 20's loves it and works out with it too!!!"
4,Excellent workout for the average Joe,"I bought this for my wife and she loves it! Neither of us are strong on the exercising but this video is very encouraging; it's practical and do-able for a beginner and intense enough for an advanced person. If you are a fitness freak however, I'm not sure but Tamilee gives a great definition for a home workout.Let me also say that Tamilee is a very attractive woman ... and while that has no impact on the fact that this is a great workout, as a guy it is important."
5,"Great bargain - solid, challenging time saver workouts","(...) you get 6 15 minute workouts that you can combine any way you like. A friend recommended this DVD to me, as she loves it too. You get 2 workouts for each abs, butt, and arms. I think it is ideal for abs and butt, as you can get a good workout in 15 minutes. I have only tried the first arm routine-- so I cannot say much about that one. Programs 1 are made to build strength--you definitely feel it. And programs 2 are meant to push you that much further. I am very pleased with this purchase. It gives me the extra motivation I need to get a solid abs or butt workout dedicating a full 15 minutes."
5,It's great,"This is a great exercise video. In each 15 minute section, she gives a tough workout. She talks during the video, by explaining the workout technique and what muscles groups you are working. I haven't found her annoying to listen to during each workout session. I've had the video for 4 months now and I've noticed that I'm more fit and toned since I started using the DVD."
5,"Very Effective, you can feel this one!!","I love this DVD. Tami is an excellent trainer. I like the 15 minute workouts and you can choose from 6. I have trained to this DVD for about 4 weeks, and often can feel the difference as well as see it. I could do without the technical info, but I suppose some might be interested."
5,WOW great DVD,"YUP I like it! Has 2 levels in three focus, abs, arms and buns. I did too much the first time, and I got really sore, so take care!"
4,Excellent for arms and legs.,"I really love this video for my arms and legs, but I'm not a fan of laying on the floor to exercise my ""core."" I believe that the core is a group of muscles that should be exercised together, rather than individual muscles that should be exercised individually, which is what it feels like this DVD tends to do. But for the arms and legs (and I feel that the leg workout really works the core anyway), it is my favorite."
5,Excellent workout dvd,After buying all the seperate vhs tapes I bought this dvd that has them all in one. Tamilee is an excellent instructor and these are great workouts. I especially love the arms and ab sections. Buy this if you want results!
3,"ok, but definitely not for a beginner","I'm only writing about the ab part of this DVD. I had the VHS one and wanted the dvd instead. Well, i hadn't done this video since i had my son 3 years ago and obviously forgot how hard it is.Although the ab workouts are good, they are TOUGH! Especially Part II. The first one is ok, until you have to extend your arms above your head, but the 2nd part is too tough for beginners. I use to be in great shape and even then, these workouts were tough.My suggestion is to get her other video instead (Abs of Steel). Even though it's older and she look dorky w/her hair, etc., the abs exercises in that one are much easier to do (they're still effective)."
5,Great fit for my life style.,"This is a great workout DVD. It focuses on working out your arms, buns and abs. I love that this DVD has two 15 minute workouts for each area you are focusing on. This allows me to fit working out into my life style. I can do 15 min. of abs and 15 min. of arms and in 30 min. I have worked out two different parts of my body. If I am crunched for time I can do 15 min. of one of the programs and fell good that I got some exercise into my day. I also like how the first 15 min. of each section is for beginners and then as you fell challenged you can do the second 15 min. which is a little more challenging."
5,Concise and Scientific!,"This is one of my favorite exercise DVD's. I like the way the workouts are segmented (2 each of abs, buns and arms), and I like the 15 minute length of each segment.Some of Tamilee's moves are unusual but seem to be quite effective. It's not an effortless workout (yet) for me, and I enjoy the challenge of the harder second segments.Not a lot of warm up and cool down is included - just enough to bring up the heart rate slightly before the workout. I think it makes the workout time more efficient and focused.I would definitely recommend this DVD for its variety!"
5,The HOLY GRAIL of fitness DVDs,"This video is the best - you get alot for your money, because 6 fifteen minute segments - 90 minutes. There are 2 programs each for your abs, legs, and arms. Each program is challenging and effective (especially the 2nd Abs program!!!). Try it out on a day that you don't have to walk the next day! The sumo-squats in the Legs program one are a killer!! The DVD is great, because you can pick and choose what parts you want to work out. I like to do one program from each category. I love Tamilee Webb because her cueing is right on and she is serious, but also fun to watch and listen to.... not annoying (like some other video instructers). This is a staple in my workout DVD collection."
4,good workout,"I recently purchased this dvd & have only done program 1 in each section, but i could feel the burn & soreness in my muscles as i was doing the exercises & the next day - in every spot that was worked. i would recommend this dvd to anyone looking to target the abs, arms, & buns. at first i was disappointed that there was no specific workout program for the thighs, however it isnt needed b/cause the thighs get a workout in the buns segment."
5,Great Workout,"I recently bought this DVD and am very impressed. I'm an intermediate weight lifter and have done the exercises Tamilee does in the DVD. The big difference is, even though I have done the exercises, her workout mananged to make me sore and sweaty in just 15 minutes. It's straight forward, motivating without being annoying, and easy to follow along. The workouts can grow with you as you improve just by adding more weight. If your under a time crunch, this is perfect."
4,Lisle 54800 review,"Delivered on time as promised. I found the shell to be 16ga. (0.060"")and the socket boss to be about 0.187"". The shell was properly sized: it slid easily over the filter (Motor craft 820-S)but didn't slip at all even when I applied 30 ft-lbs (to the OLD filter). However, that torque did cause a small deformity to the socket drive. Since 16 ft-lbs = 7/8 turn after gasket contact, I see no problem getting full useful life from this tool."
3,Just okay...,"This one did alright (though as my first I could not compare it to anything) Though it was too large for penetration, the ripples+vibes were nice for exterior stimulation.Then suddenly it died on me and the ripples-vibes= not as great. The texture, being waterproof and shape bought the three but -2 stars for giving out right in the middle of use."
3,"Ok, but nothing fantastic","This is an OK toy, but the batteries drain before I'm done and the shape isn't terribly fun for me. I far prefer the g-spot attachment on my hitachi magic wand for internal stimulation. The base is a bit awkward to use, and it just seemed to fall short of the Fun Factory toy it's based off of.My advice is break down and get the more expensive toys, the Fun Factory or the Hitachi and attachments, they aren't that much more expensive but they will last a hell of a lot longer and be a heck of a lot more fun."
4,Absorbent and Good Size,"I like that the towel is big, soft and absorbent. The only thing I don't like is that the monkey applique is rough and we can't really dry our son's hair with that portion since it's too rough."
4,One of the top shooters for the system,This game is one of the top shooters for the system. Much like Novastorm and Starblade this one is slightly better then the other two. With it being the best looking of the three.
1,Very enlightening film,"This was an informative historical video in as much as it shows (hopefully) the viewer how an attempt has been made to propagandize the Arab/Israeli conflict. It was definitely made with one purpose in mind. Throughout the entire film not one mention was made of the death and destruction that the Zionists committed against the Arab population. Not one reference was made about the brutal murders that were committed by the Zionist militias like the Irgun. Or how almost a million Arabs were driven from their homes and communities. On a scale of 1 to 10, I give it a 10 for blatant bias alone. History is never one-sided, despite what's portrayed by films like this one."
1,German-English-English-German Dictionary (Hippocrene Practical Dictionary) [LARGE PRINT] (Paperback),order never received. would like for customer service to contact me about the entire order placed in Oct 2005thanks ch
1,0 stars was not an option,"The only thing good about this package was the cell phone case. The ear bud sounds muffled and you cant hear the person you are talking to while driving down the road. The car charger did not work, says it is compatible with my phone, but only if you held the phone and pushed the plug in a certain direction in the phone. The second you let go, it disconnected. I requested an exchange, and it came with the same problem. Save your money and go to wal-mart. Buy their compatible charger for the sph-a460, it works perfectly for $8.00. I now have a $25 cell phone case, because the two charger and ear buds that were sent are worthless."
1,If it only worked reliably,"We bought these adapter kits for our new Samsung phones.Unfortunately the connector for the car adapter is not made correctly and gives out after a couple of weeks of use. This prevents reliable charging of the phone and at best the phones are constantly ""chirping"", making th sounds they make as the power is connected and disconnected.We have tried 3 of these adapters on 4 supposedly compatible phones with no combination working reliably."
4,Fabulous Porsche 917,"I actually had this book (1st edition) as a young boy and took it everywhere with me. It became so tattered and pages falling out that I finally had to part with it. I was fortunate to locate another copy and now that I am much older, hope not to wear it out.The book is a terrific reference for the amazing 917 family of racing Porsches. Great line drawings and historical racing accomplishments. Coverage of 908 and 917s at LeMans plus the 917 Can Am variants."
1,Had NO affect at all.,Would never buy it again. ///////////// ??????????? ?????????? ????????? ?????? ??????? ???????? ????????? ?????? ???????? ???????? ???????? ????????? ????????? /????
1,"ANYTHING GOOD TO SAY, I SAY NOT!!!!!!!!!!","WE PURCHASED THIS IN 2004,WE HAVE HAD NOTHING BUT GREIF! WHILE WE HAD THE WARRENTY, IT HAS BEEN TOREN APART SEVERAL TIMES, MOST OF THE ORIGINAL PARTS HAVE BEEN REPLACED.FROM OWNING LESS THAN 3-6 MOS.. IT WOULD BLEEP AND POWER OFF. WE NOW CARRY THE VOLUME BAR 3/4 HIGH TO HEAR IT,AND NOW OWNING IT W/O IT BEING REPLACED,THEY SAID THEY WOULD FIX IT AND NOT REPLACE IT, WE ARE STUCK W/IT,1 YEAR LATER IT HAS TO WARM UP 1/2 HOUR TO GET A DECENT PICTURE.

I OWN A PIECE OF ___- TVAND VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH TOSHIBA,AND I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHERTOSHIBA PRODUCT AGAIN. LW.NEW YORK"
1,Sooooo NOT Happy....,"Bought this TV 3 years ago. Scrambled, wavy picture takes 30 minutes to ""warm up"" before you can see what's going on. HD comes in right away, but most channels I have are not in HD. I think a TV this expensive should last more than 3 years!"
4,Great music,I luv her voice and this album contained songs I had never heard her sing. The songs were very good and a good use of her voice.
3,Capital Collector's Series,"I rememer my parents being big Jo Stafford fans. I was a little disappointed on this one, probably should have look longer."
5,Great resource and fascinating reading,"Describing details along both River Roads (one on each bank) from Baton Rouge to New Orleans, this is a great read. From Colonial to Antebellum to the Refineries populating the area now, its a very interesting and informative book. Including both straightforward history about various plantations and local people as well as colorful local stories, it's a great read. I only wish someone would write a guide like this for the area stretching north from Baton Rouge to Natchez to make it dovetail with Persac's map, around which much of the book revolves."
2,Poorly Organized for Guidebook Use,"This book provides an excellent narrative but is poorly organized and lacks maps and photos which would have made it a much more useful guide book. When it is redone, it should start with a map with number references for the plantations and ruins described, put them in logical sequencial order and provide at least one black and white photo for each to aid readers."
5,Speedy delivery in excellent condition - a wealth of information,"I think this book must have arrived the day after I ordered it, sold as used but in like new condition. The first half of the book addresses the cultural, political and natural history of the river road district in chapter after chapter before you get to the second section which is set out in geographical order as a handbook for travelers. It is like no other travel book I have ever read. Obviously a labor of love meant to reveal to the traveler more than meets the eye through the windshield of one's car. It will reward those who flip to whichever milepost to learn the historical significance of a church, barn or factory as it will reward those who have the patience and curiosity to read it cover to cover."
5,My River Road bible,"""Along the River Road"" is an unparalleled resource for obtaining manifold historical and present day facts and anecdotes about River Road, while evoking the true feel of this unique culture and landscape. Thank you, Ms. Sternberg, for this well researched, fascinating, and thoroughly enjoyable resource!Csaba Lukacs (Editor of ""The Coffee Shop Chronicles of New Orleans"")"
2,Unorganized Shot Review,For a book that is stated to be rich in history and culture of Louisiana's River Road is miss leading. This book is and unorganized short review of the River Road. I bought the book to read because of the German Settlement of the Coast of Louisiana. When looking information in the Index you need to read between the lines (Word) to find the exactly what is means. This is not a mile by mile guide tour when you go back and forth.
5,"Great reminder of a good film... yet, great on it's own.","This album is a wonderfully crafted disc. It combines some of the greatest tracks from the moive. When I listened to it I initially had fond memeories of a great film. After repeated listening I began to enjoy several of the pieces on their own (such as Track # 10). This album I proudlt pum loud with the windows down and the sunroof open. It also, introduced me more to Indian music. A perfect place to begin fot the virgin listener, you get a mix of traditional and current popular dance styles.**********************************Loved this album, started the increased depth of my past shallow love for Inidan music."
2,Worked well while it worked,"Well, I bought two of these on sale at Best Buy. Before, I had a little Rio player that lasted me forever . . . when that one died, I bit the bullet and bought the Samsung.And if my phone weren't Samsung, and I weren't thrilled with it, I'd swear off the company forever. Both players had compatibility issues on ANY program I tried to use to transfer music. One time out of ten the program could find the player, the other times, not so much. I surfed the 'Net all I could; no support, no fixes. This wasn't an issue for long, because both players stopped working in totality within three months.I was majorly disappointed in this product and will probably find another brand for my next MP3 player."
1,Do not buy this product,I bought two...one for my son and one for myself. My son's failed after two days...mine a week later. Getting service/support has been a nightmare.
4,Worth the money...even though only lasted 1.5 years,"I bought this product about a year and a half ago.First the bad: While transferring files about two weeks ago, my pc and the player froze up. It now says that I have zero free memory and it is no longer recognized by my pc. I can no longer access files.The good: It was an awesome product while it lasted.I have no idea what some of the reviewers are talking about when it comes to this player. I transferred files directly through windows. Simple as drag and drop. I never had to use Media Player or any other software.I liked the fact that I didn't have to have a cord to charge the unit. It played for a very long time on one charge.I used it as a flash drive as well with no problems."
2,Good for the first 5 months,"I received this as a gift last December and was thrilled to get one of these. It worked great from the beginning, then little glitches started happening. First, it wasn't recognized as a flash drive on my computer; ok, fine, wasn't planning to use that feature. A couple of weeks after, it started not being able to be recognized on Windows Media Player 11; grr..okay, downgrade to previous version. This past month, it stopped being recognized on my computer completely; what the heck?!?! Well, at least it works on my work computer. Now, it isn't being recognized by either!! I should just chuck this thing in the trash but it still works and charges, I just can no longer change up the songs anymore. Grrr....enjoying music shouldn't be this hard."
5,Awesome little player...........,"I purchased the Sandisk Sansa m240 for my son for Christmas. Well, it only lasted a couple of days and then it locked up. After reading more reviews about it I found that almost everyone was having the same problem. So when I returned it I purchased this one instead of getting another Sansa. This one is so much better. My son loves it much more than the Sansa. During the short time that the Sansa worked he thought it was ok but when he got this one he said it is a lot better. The earphones seem to be better quality and it just seems like a much better quality player all around. It's very small but packs a big punch soundwise. Very crisp and clear. It has all the features we were looking for. A good price for everything that you get in this little player. My husband likes it so much he wants one of his own to take to work."
4,Good all around,"Great player, fantastic storage size vs. physical size, and the fm radio tuner makes it my favorite small mp3 player, even over the nano. One slight drawback is that I haven't figured out how to add files via the iTunes interface; right now I'm stuck using the clunky Windows Media Player library, which isn't always sync'ed up with my iTunes. It's a little more effort, but I'm sure there are ways to streamline it which I haven't figured out yet."
1,WARNING; Will not be recognized by Windows if you have WMP 11,"The YP-U2J will not be recognized by WMP 11, which is the latest edition of Media Player. The Instillation CD with the unit has the old WMP 10 to download in order for the unit to be recognized. If you have the new WMP 11, you have to ""System Restore"" to a time before you upgraded to WMP 11 then make sure you install the old WMP 10. WWW.Samsung.com has a download center for the unit software, but the new drivers for YP-U2J are not posted for downloading as of 2/27/07. These drivers are needed for WMP 11 no matter what size unit you get, .5, 1, or 2 Gig. So be Aware of this before purchasing one."
2,Good product but terrible to manage from a PC,"When it works it is good. I have been using it for 2 weeks to listen to podcasts and music. The sound quality is good. I use it while running on the sidewalk (on a road with lot of traffic) and on airplanes. The volume level is high enough to hear in both of those environments. Things I did not like(a) It does not work with WMP 11 after a couple of times (and the manual, the configuration checker on the CD and the Samsung website are all mum about this!). The PC and WMP did not recognize the product - and no reason was given. The manual is written for dummies but with out any content! Had to spend a lot of time to do research; figured out that I had to uninstall WMP 11 and go back to WMP 10. WMP11 to WMP10 on XP is not an easy task!(b) The cap is easy to lose!"
3,Samsung still rocks!,"This is an overall good product.Cons:- Back light can't be turned off = battery dies quickly.- Can't record straight off the radio.- Only way to upload songs is to sync with windows media player 10.Pros:- Everything else typical to a mp3 player.This player is cheap and by converting my mp3s to wma files using windows' free audio converter, I have 367 tracks on it with 70mb of space still free. I Brought this in April and it still is running like new."
2,This ending really bothered me,"Ah yes, another Full Moon Production at its best. Stitches, I must say, really bothered me. At the end of the movie, the bad guy won and bigtime did she win! The devil stitches on a human suit and starts taking human souls that she makes into paper dolls. I thought someone would beat her, but NO! no one does! This is not a bad movie, but it is a BAD movie--the bad guy wins. I guess the fact that it got such a rise out of me should give it three stars, but the acting was so poor and parts of it were so dull, I just couldn't bring myself to it."
5,I LIKED IT,"I found it a very good recording. It's quite different from the Simon Preston (the other recording I own), but both stand on their own. It is definitely Richter style Haendel, and not for those who demand a more English style. I found it very enjoyable, but perhaps not as dramatic as other recordings."
5,Great sample problems,"Kaplan's GMAT 800 offers the most challenging sample problems for students who want a top score.I raised my score 60 points from 650 on my first Powerprep run to 710 on the actual test with only three weeks of prep. Using both Kaplan and Princeton Review books offers the perfect well-rounded preparation. Princeton Review offers advice on how to read the questions and eliminate answers. ButKaplan has the advantage in sample problems (challenging and, for the most part, well-explained).In my mind, Princeton Review seems to have less respect for the test. They want you to beat it by understanding its design amd seeing through its tricks. Kaplan, on the other hand, wants to help you do well through thorough review of the material. Both are important appraoches, and they complement each other well."
1,Don't buy this book if you're taking the Kaplan class,"Although I thought this book would be very helpful in my quest to score well on the GMAT, I found that all of the questions in the book can also be found in the Kaplan study guides. That's right, if you take the Kaplan course, you will get the same questions in your CD-Rom and online resources as those offerred in the book. So if you're not in the Kaplan course, this book will probably serve its purpose. However, if you ponied up the money for the Kaplan course, buy a different book."
1,Great story; poorly made movie,"As a high school English teacher, I was hoping for a video that augmented the story. My students really enjoy so many elements of ""The Yellow Wallpaper"" and reading it generates great discussion. I took a risk and bought the video without seeing it, and that was a mistake. It's quite limited in capturing Gilman's tone and setting and characterization. The wallpaper, which is a significant symbol, doesn't even come close to matching the story's description. There is so little of Gilman's rich imagery portrayed."
1,The Yellow Wallpaper (Monologue),"I was severely disappointed in this portrayal of Gilman's ""The Yellow Wallpaper"". I teach literature and was looking for a piece that dramatized the story - this wasn't it. It is a one woman show, with the text recited word for word as a monologue. The version that I was shown in class (as a student) was by BBC and much more appropriate as well as appealing. I looked into purchasing that but only found it for a price outside of my budget. I settled for this, and yes it was settling. My students were beyond bored and asked not to continue watching it in class. For those who have never read the story, perhaps this version would be a suggestion.SUGGESTED VERSION FROM BBC: [...]"
5,"Intense, compelling performance","A one-woman show, as this story unfolds, it draws you in - she draws you in to her fantastic nightmare world. The character, confined to her bedroom for most of the performance, starts out as a questionable witness and appears to be increasingly mad as her narrative goes on.This dvd of The Yellow Wallpaper has much of the feel of being at a live performance. The actress, Aasne Vigesaa, is wonderful to watch. It is an intense, compelling performance.I cared about the woman, was drawn in and empathized with her. It has come back to my mind like a remembered experience.I recommend this dvd."
5,"Love cats? Find this book, buy this book!",This is a truly beautiful book that celebrates the bond between a cat and the woman who loves him. A scrawny old cat loves a scrawny old woman; but the cat is coming to the end of his eighth life. What will he choose for his ninth life?
4,Mexican movie idols from the golden age.,"I owned a copy of ""No Basta ser Charro"" but it wasn't a good restoration. The audio was poor. When I saw these 2 movies together I took the chance again. I hoped for a better restoration and I also wanted ""Tu y Las Nubes"". This company is great and I hope they make a Million$. The quality is as good as when I saw the movies in theaters. The audio couldn't be better. The 'Magic' is the way they made music videos of the songs. 10 songs, with their menu are availble to watch. I've never seen it done and 'love it'. What a wonderful idea. All movie musicals should be done this way. This is 5 star workmanship applied to 2 great Mexican movies."
3,Double the value!,Expecting to get 4 plays from Victor Hugo I was suprised that my edition contained 8 plays! Only problem with that is that it was 4 plays printed twice each. The promised introduction was lacking also. There are no notes accompanying the text in this version so buyers may want to check other options for Hugo's plays. The content is quite entertaining so don't be entirely put off.
5,Great addition to your Spanish library,"This is nice book that actually shows grammar structure (adjectives follow the noun in Spanish) as well as simple words like colors and shapes. Many books cover colors, but few cover shapes, so this is a nice one to pass around in my Spanish classes, along with this author's other titles. I enjoy that they are slick pages, brightly colored and sturdy.There's no phonetic spelling, though, so if you're not sure about pronunciation, you may need to begin with another curriculum that has a CD or a pronunciation guide. As a supplement, this is great!Sra. GoseAuthor of Flip Flop Spanish: Ages 3-5: Level 1 (Book + CD)Flip Flop Spanish: Ages 6-9: Level 1 (Book + Audio CD)"
3,The picture doesnt do it justice,"I recieved the books fast. The picture makes it look like its a regular size book, but its not..no wonder it was only 3.95 but then S/H brought it up to around 7.00!This is a small little flip book for like a 2 year old. Small,about 1 min to read..."
4,Lovely Dolly,Absolutley perfect and a delightful little friend for Sleeping Beauty! I really like these products and wish Amazon had more of the outfits that come with them.
4,Wonderful Workbook,"I used Mounce's Basics of Biblical Greek for Seminary Greek and have found this an excellent way to maintain what I learned. I like gaining experience translating larger passages from the Greek text. I'm starting to feel more comfortable working with the Greek.The one reviewer who said the binding is terrible and that pages quickly fall out is absolutely correct.It was very helpful to use this workbook with Mounce's BBG Vocab cards. The vocab lists are organized in a Friends, Cousins and Strangers format, but they actually pick up from the BBG vocab card list and move in order.Overall, the tie-in with Mounce's BBG material is excellent and this is a more than worthwhile investment to maintain your NT Greek and prepare for Mounce's Graded Biblical Reader."
4,"Good resource, but perhaps redundant with the Graded Reader","I faithfully completed this workbook in between Basics of Biblical Greek and Mounce's Graded Reader, and while it was helpful I'm not sure that I wouldn't have done just as well to go straight into the Graded Reader. I am a solo-learner and don't need to follow along with the normal schedule of first year, summer break, second year Greek, so perhaps I am simply not the target audience. Nevertheless, it is a well made tool that adds additional guided translating resources to students of NT Greek."
5,Great Purchase!!,"I bought this TV second hand from a man who only owned it 6 months. This is by far the best TV I have ever seen! Not only is the picture unbelievable, the sound is flat-out freakin awesome! Surround sound is built in and it sounds like it has a large subwoofer with the massive amounts of thundering bass it cranks out! The large screen is so nice in our home that it really seems like we are in a theatre. I guess there is only one problem...finding an entertainment center to house this beast! I wouldn't take too much from the last bad reviews since one sounds like just a bad customer service experience, and who cares about satillite TV anyway??? GET THIS TV, very nice!"
2,disappointed!,We purchased our new Toshiba HDMI model # 65H14 and NO ONE has the cables to connect it to Dish high deffinition system! We have looked in St. Louis and Potosi & Farmington! We have not been able to see what HDMI looks like yet! We had to purchase the Dish System 811 from Dish network but if you are a new subscriber you can have one FREE! Thanks for nothing so far! It is so new that no one carries the cables! I have an idea! Why not send the cables with the TV!?
5,The Best Jack yet!,"I have been in love with this series and its heroine since I first picked up the paperback of ""Bloody Jack"" and saw the incredible string of rave reviews on the back.""In the Belly of the Bloodhound"" takes on the issue of slavery from a totally new slant and still ties in with the series. Better yet, in this book, Meyer brings his villainness, Clarissa Worthington Howe, into full and sharp relief. Clarissa is not your cardboard cut-out villain but a real, flesh-and-blood, stab-you-in-the-back-with-a-smile, uppercrust snob who makes the perfect foil for our Jacky -- and still turns out to be undeniably human and worthy in her own right.The characters in this book, in particular, are very well drawn.Bravo!"
5,Keeps You Wanting More,"Wow! I just finished this book and I must say that it was great! The full package, really, with humor from about all the characters, a bit of action and although you know what's going to happen(pretty much) from the bookflap summary it keeps you wondering. ALSO, I don't believe this should be read by a 12 year old, more like late 13 year old for some of the content.This is good stuff and I suggest it greatly! And, thankfully, the new installment of the series comes in September(Though I wish it was sooner)."
3,A snapshot of a pebble on the beach of life,"""The Drowned Son"" is a snapshot of a pebble on the beach of life, with all the inherent corniness the phrase entails: Hutchinson's son dies in October in an accident on a fishing boat. The boy had been looking for a direction for his life and sought adventure in Alaska, where he met his death. A few months later, the boat's skipper comes to meet the parents and tells the story of the accident. Through helping the parents understand their son, what made him, and what drove him, the skipper helps them face their conflict and find closure."
4,When I am feeling way down low,"Parker and Lily are a band from Athens, Georgia and who have spent some time in Brooklyn, NY. Parker Noon and Lily Wolfe have been a couple for ten years too. This album was so intense in the making that they broke up afterwards. The band still survives though. They have retreated to their neutral corners. Parker and Lily have played with Interpol and Future Bible Heroes. Their music has a lot in common with those bands. They are romantic and tragic. Parker's signature vocals have a lot of echo on them. Lily Wolfe plays the organ and makes a lot of noise. It is very intimate music. This album is much better than the previous ones. Before they were like a lot of New York bands who grew up on David Lynch and Nick Cave and wore suits. Now they incorporate more American roots music. Maybe before they sounded like this weird atmospheric band. Now they are like an American Arab Strap, very personal and very original."
2,Not like anything Mom used to make,"I purchased this book because I LOVE to cook and am always looking for lowfat ways to prepare the foods I ate growing up that had WAY too much fat for me now. I have been VERY disappointed with it. In the past 3 weeks, I have tried 6 recipes so far. It was not ANYTHING like I had hoped for, and I even threw a few away because they tasted awful! I will keep trying a few more but so far am very dissatisfied with this book!"
5,WOW!!!,All I can say is WOW!! I had a Hot Tools straightener for years and could never get my hair straight and shiny like when I left my hairdresser! I thought it was my hair or product I used? Nope.... it was the straightener. I splurged on this after asking my hairdresser what she used and WOW! LOL I can now do my hair the same way she does and it looks awesome! Super shiny and very healthy feeling! I love this straightener.... worth the money!!!
1,very disappointed,"i am a profession hair stylist with many years experience using flat irons. i was very disappointed with this iron. within two months the iron started having issues with the cord causing the iron to go on and off. i feel this iron was not ""new"" but refurbished and definately not ""professional"" quality. the previous iron i was using was a ""infrashine"" which worked beautifully. i can not reconmmend this product from the seller i purchased it from."
2,Not as good as the old one,"Several years ago, I purchased the same product. I loved it and used it daily. I dropped it on the floor and had to replace it. I chose the same model thinking they would function exactly the same. Unfortunately, the new infrashine does not live up to the heat and performance of my old product. I have been dissatisfied with this purchase and given the amount I paid wish I would have looked into the Chi or similar products."
1,Horrible product,"I bought this iron from a salon. I wouldn't buy it again. Within six months the adhesive on the plates melted, allowing the plates to fall out. I couldn't find my purchase info so couldn't do anything about the warranty. I reglued the plates using a high-temp adhesive which held but reeked at the higher temps required to straighten my hair. If that weren't enough, there appears to be a loose connection in the 360-degree rotating cord, and now I have to hold the thing ""just right"" in order to get it to heat. I am buying a new iron, and this piece of junk is going straight into the trash."
2,Mystery Oil,"The ASTM cSt specifications are not printed on the bottles or available on the Finish Line website, so for any kind of accurate shock tuning these oils are useless since basic viscosity numbers are as good as meaningless in the world of shock oils. I submitted a request to Finish Line for this information and it has gone unanswered. Most good oils provide this critical information freely. If you are just topping off an old beater fork this stuff is probably fine, but for my use it was a waste of money."
5,Great!!,"Great EP for an independent band! The recording quality is way above average and the song are well written, with great hooks and great musicianship. I highly recommend it."
5,Great buy for under $500,"Picked this TV up two days ago and so far I am very happy. I'm 26 years old now and this is my 2nd Toshiba TV since I was in 8th grade.I got a deal and being I purchased the floor model from Best Buy, they gave it to me for $450 - which I think is a steal. The price was contingent on me purchasing the ESP - Extended Serivce Plan - for $100, but provides for 4 years in home service.Overall, very satisfied - if you can find this TV for under $500, it's worth every penny. The pic is as sharp and displays computer video much better then my brother's 32"" Sony."
2,Better off reading Hammer or Smith,"I hate dissing stuff, but this one really disappointed me. Average at best. The book says ""By professional, for professionals."" Some of the frameworks are useful no doubt, but the insight of a Hammer, or Smith, is not there.[...]"
3,Why such slow tempi?,"As one whose first experience with Mahler 5 is the von Karajan, I find the most striking thing about Sir Barbirolli's reading of Mahler 5 is the excessively slow tempi in just about all the movements. There's no sparkle to the scherzo and no excitement to the second movement. The inner movements seem to weigh down the entire symphony. The outer movements are a bit slow for my taste, but at least they seem coherent. The same could be said of Barbirolli's arthrosclerotic reading of the opening and scherzo movements of Mahler 6, as well. I would recommend getting this recording simply because it is noted as one of ""the best"" (it did earn a Penguin rosette, after all) but also keep around a more modern, cleaner-sounding and peppier version as well."
2,Good book for basic student knowledge,This is an excellent text for PT students or for the PT with no acute orthopedic experience. It provides basic and fundamental information. I do not recommend it for the therapist with experience; it is too elementary.
3,"Good for students, fair for clinicians","This text may be of benefit to the student physical therapist, when he/she is familiarizing himself with general ortho protocols. However, generally this information is clearly outlined by the referring orthopedic surgeon. I do not recommend this book to experienced clinicians, as the information is very remedial."
2,Too mediocre for practitioners,I agree with the comments of previous readersthat the info is just mediocre and not a goodbook for cliniciansI regret this buy
3,This book is decent,This book is supplementary at best in its conditioning program. The conditioning shown does not include enough variety to fully develop mature athletes.
5,"Bravo, Doctor Cuellar","Bravo to Carlos Cuellar for his history of the Fort Worth Mexican-American community. His combined historical and sociological approach that he garnished so well with interesting interviews and oral histories makes for an excellent presentation of a people's struggle to settle and succeed in the creation of a community that became their barrio.Dr. Cuellar's outstanding collection of period photographs combined with his fluid and well organized presentation make for wonderfully easy reading for non- academics while setting a serious academic blueprint for historians, sociologists and anthropologists to do similar studies of other Hispanic communities in the United States. Personally, I would like to see Cuellar encourage his students into doing similar and much needed studies of communities along the Rio Grande from Laredo to Brownsville, Texas."
5,Still the best reference,I purchase this book back in 1979. Though I have purchased other newer books about processing digitized speech I always find myself going back to this book as a reference. No other engineering book does as good a job of describing characteristics of the speech signal.
2,Camera Bag or Lunch Bag?,"I've purchased this bag with every intention of taking my camera along with me every where I go. Now it just sits on a shelf collecting dust. It looks like a huge lunch bag rather than a small camera bag. It's a bit cumbersome. The good thing about it is that it keeps the camera from harm, but at the same time it's too bulky."
4,Buy it for the CD,"I felt this book had the best exams and chapter review questions.Nonethless I recommend you read all the OCP books out there, and take all the sample exams you can get you hands on."
3,Well written but out out sync with exam.,The book is well written and provides the student with good working knowledge of Oracle 7/8. But the materials seem to be slightly out of sync with the exams. Some subject areas are covered in greater detail than necessary for the exam. A few of the exam question topics were not covered in the Training Guide. The book's review questions do not properly prepare the student for the complex type of questions on the exam.
4,Good Study Guide,"There are some small errors, but the book has good examples and covers most of the exam topics. It's easy to read and well organized. Since there aren't so many OCP study guides, you should give it a try."
2,Lacking the meat,"This book has good organization; yet lacks the delivery of the goods. Touches on the subjects briefly; sometimes confuses the issues completely and shrouds things in more mystery than necesarry. The test questions are riddled with mistakes. Obviously whoever wrote them did not read it or any other reference materials. In short, need more and better meat than this to pass."
2,Nothing but an overview,This book lightly touches on the objectives. It doesn't have NEARLY the material to pass the test. I compared test objectives on official Oracle sample tests to covered objectives on this book and found out that in many cases this book DID NOT either have the objective or covered it lightly. You will probably need the Oracle Complete Reference book and another Oracle Press-type DBA book to prepare for the exams. The only good thing about this book is that you can get a decent knowledge of database administration in only 100 pages (not enough for the exam though).
3,why the author did not include a disk or CD with this book?,Hope the author encloses a disk or CD which contain the sample question. thanks.
2,Bad pill counter,"I was very disappointed with the quality of the product I ordered. The side was chipped and the pins were coming out where the lid is connected. I tried on several occasions to contact the company and no one answered the phone. I also left messages asking them to call me, which no one ever did. I would not buy from this company again."
1,horrible customer service/shoddy product,"Two of the four pill counting trays arrived cracked and unusable. Upon contacting the seller, I received the run-around and an extremely poor response. While the seller did end up replacing the two damaged trays, it took weeks and it took NUMEROUS phone calls and emails to get this taken care of. I am beyond disappointed in the poor customer service. The product is not well made either and prob ably won't last as it is made of a type of plastic that cracks easily. In addition, the seller refuses to add packing material so I'm sure many products get damaged during shipping. Some simple packing peanuts or whatever would have prevented the problem in the first place. I would never purchase this item again and I would NEVER purchase from this seller again!!!"
2,Grafco pill counter,Very shody merchandiseThe pins that hold the case give away. One is already lost.DissapointingAbe Burnovski
1,Cheap China quality,Very disappointed in the quality. Cheap China plastic with sharp rough edges on it - had to sand the edges. Hard to use because the tool to count the pills is not bent at an angle like some other models.
3,Nice item as descibed,"Item is as described. great little pill counter. Shipping was really slow on this item, took about 3 weeks to get."
4,Surprise for the kiddies. . . .,"Mungo Jerry still gets a lot of play around Chicago ""In the Summertime.. ."" I bought this CD at the request of my kids, ages 5 and 8, who heard the song and begged to have it. Imagine my surprise when the CD arrived and I found that the fifth song, an instrumental, is listed on the liner and CD as ""Motherf--ker blues"" only without the blanks. Really a shock, since the CD is full of bouncy and kid-friendly music. So, bottom line: it's cute music; parents, get out your indelible markers. . ."
5,Unique...,"This album was issued in 1970 (in the US on the Janus label) on an unsuspecting audience of Dead-heads, Beatlemania and the like. This album is strictly fun, and features jugband music with such instruments as acoustic bass,kazoo,banjo and guitars of course. Featuring their well known tune I think you'll find yourself listening to the rest of the disc possibly more than the hit. This was additionally issued as part of a 2-on-1 set by BGO Records which featured their second album ""Electronically Tested""."
4,Legendary recording!,"I think that Gustav Leonhardt is a fantastic harpsichord player. His interpretations feels fresh even today and there is a feeling of live-performance over these recordings which is very good and in some way relaxing for the music. Though the string-playing on old instruments wasn't so developed at the time of this recording it is still an highly enjoyable disc, mostly because of the baroque-genious Gustav Leonhardt!"
2,the detached approach and poor balance degrade pleasure.,"although in the sixties this must have been an interesting issue,by now it's outdated both on sonic standards and somewhat chilled musicmaking;the tempi are often brisk and unrelenting,especially 1065 is excellent to work up a frenzy."
5,One of the best books I've read in a long time!,"This book made me laugh out loud so many times the people around me on the train must have thought I was crazy, but I just didn't care, I was enjoying it so much. This book is funny, irreverant and smart. I loved the characters and wanted to be in their group of friends! There are tons of ""chick-lit"" books out there but none that I've read where there is dark and dry edge to the humor. Bravo Kim Green, I can't wait to read your next two books and the 4th I know is on the way..."
2,Yet another compilation of weak early recordings,"For the collector only, these are mostly live performances from Miles' early career and tend to be muddy recordings of typical bop. All have been issued on various compilations before. Better compilations are ""Out of the Blue"" by Hallmark and ""Miles Davis at the Royal Roost 1948, at Birdland 1950, 1953"" by Le Jazz. Track Listing: 1.Conception; 2.Ray's Idea; 3.That Old Black Magic; 4.Max is Making Wax; 5.Woody'n You; 6.Down; 7.Move; 8.The Squirrel; 9.Lady Bird; 10.Confirmation; 11.Out of the Blue; 12.52nd St. Theme; 13.Half Nelson; 14.Night in Tunisia; 15.Dig; 16.Chasin' the Bird; 17.Hot House; 18.Walkin'; 19.Bye Bye Blackbird; 20.I Got Rhythm; Dates: 1-5:(February 18,1950); 6:(June 2,1951); 7-9:(June 29,1951); 10-11:(May 2, 1952); 12:?; 13:?; 14-15,20:(May 16, 1953); 16:(September 25, 1948); 17:(May 1950); 18-19:(May 17, 1958);"
2,Less than I had hoped,"The products I sent for were not up to the usual quality of the products I normally get from Amazon, they were of poor quality and the charger did not work properly."
4,Excellent Value,I was quite suprised to see that the quality of this starter kit was higher than my expectations.I have purchased cases for the I500 for much more money than what I paid for this and they didn't fit as well nor were they engineered as well.I haven't used the earphone or car charger yet but if they are up to the quality level of the case I will be very pleased.
5,Great Series,"This is a must buy for any lover of the Lemony Snickett series. A terrific set of books, and much cheaper to buy as the ""Horrendous Heap"" then individually!"
1,Sensitive kids beware,"I read the other reviews with interest, because it appears many children really loved these books. My sensitive ten year old boy, however, was deeply disturbed by the theme of orphaned children at the mercy of adults who feel no concern for their welfare. He had nightmares after hearing this book on tape one afternoon at someone else's house. I must say, however, that he has had very selective exposure to t.v. and movies, so he may be more impressionable than other kids with more experience of media. Just thought I'd add some balance to the reviews."
2,To answer the other Reviewer's question on the matter of book quality...,"This review is on just the physical quality of the books, not the inside content/story itself:To answer a question posed by another Reviewer, yes, it is true... I just received my books one through twelve shipment yesterday and the quality of the books is poor. They looked very handsome on the pictures available at various websites but up close and physically in my hand, I found that the end of book pages do not line up (tattered/not smooth) and the cover of the books are flimsy with peel-on like plastic sticker displaying the title of the book. I got this set as a collector's item for keepsake but not worth it."
4,Hamlin Garland's dad,"This book wasn't what I thought it was going to be. Garland used a very thin cover of fiction to describe his dad's early life through his later life. As the reader discovers the Graham family, it becomes clear it is really the Garland family. I found that to be distracting. The story did give quite a bit of background for Garland's more famous ""A Son of the Middle Boarder"" and ""A Daughter of the Middle Boarder."" I liked the book, but I probably won't ever re-read it."
2,silly simple veilwork,"i bought this video online and i mistakenly thought this video would teach some real challenging steps. I was unaware that it was all veilwork and the title ""mystic dance"" gave no indication that it was veilwork. I wish I didnt spend money to buy a video that teaches you how to walk a few steps and twirl a piece of cloth. you dont need to spend money to learn how to do that."
4,easy to learn most of it,"most of it was easy to learn and it does help if you have a veil or something to use like one, the only part that i think is difficult (at least for me) are the turns, I kept getting nauseous so that will take me awhile to get past, but the rest is fun."
5,Excellent Product !,"I think this should be a standard product to have for any parent. Kids pick up everything from the school and daycare environment. We tend to take children to the doctor at the drop of a hat for antibiotics, but do nothing to help them with their natural immune system. I am so excited this product was developed. I have 5 children and 12 grandchildren. This is something I am VERY familiar with. I was babysitting one of my grandchildren that was dropped of with a cold. They layed down on the couch with a stuffy nose. I gave them Airborne Jr and in 20 minutes the stuffy nose was gone and they were up off the couch playing. My household will never be without it."
3,Mahler 3,"I tend to agree with dpetit about the faster tempo in the last movement, also the timpani seem too 'hollow' with the faster pace in the climax. Quite possible the orchestra was not technically proficient enough at this stage for this work. Sir Simon gives a good performance but more mature conductors have given this symphony a smoother interpretation. The Horenstein is very good but I also enjoy the Salonen/LAPO recording (I know he is a contemporary and friend of Sir Simons) with Anna Larson as the contralto soloist. The tempi seem more balanced and the final movements from 'O Mensch'are smooth and fulsome in sound."
3,Last Movement is too fast!!!,"The spoiling all of us have enjoyed RE: Bernstein notwithstanding, the last movement of this otherwise wonderful performance is simply too fast. Don't waste time with it, because you will not experience the full value of the magnificence of this final movement (and therefore of the entire performance) with this recording. The brass and wind playing are superb, but unfortunately, nothing can counter the blasphemy wrought on us by the galloping gait to the uninspiring finish. Bernstein still rules...!"
5,Excellent television,"This TV is an excellent value, just as Consumer Reports described. It has brought new life to DVD movies, and it makes my so-so analog cable signal look as clear as digital cable! 32"" is the perfect screen size for my living room, where people sit 6-10 feet from the TV. All the inputs a geek could want are included, including component, S-Video, and front-panel A/V inputs. Some other reviewers have said it's necessary to calibrate the picture, but I think it looks terrific right out of the box. I'll try their suggestions, though, and see if I can squeeze out even more."
3,Rating is still up in the air,"Although the picture and sound is really very good, I am on my 3rd exchange of this set. There is a problem where there is a band of white or grey light which seems to be splashing onto the left side of the screen. Therefore I gave it a middle rating.Toshiba offered to have a technician look at it, but I felt that a brand new set should work the first time.So, a final exchange is being made but the set will come from a different depot anticipating that it was not part of the same batch which has given me a set which I consider has a problem.The store I purchased this from has been very accommodating and cooperative."
4,positive thinking,a relaxing cd to listen to and more interesting to know that it is assisting in positive thinking.used as a gift. the recipient loved it.
4,The best AA album I've heard yet,"I love this CD. What fresh break from my other jazz music. Acoustic Alchemy always manages to sound unique, and that's not an easy thing to do anymore. Even with this album's undertone of sadness for Mr. Webb, it still pumps energy. ""Positive Thinking"" seems to be more than just a title. Get this disk if you want classy jazz music, or jazzed up new age."
5,Lovely,"This scent smells wonderful! Recently my mom and I took up soap making, and we both love how this smells! It's great, especially for teens."
3,Not as useful as it looks,"I got this CD organizer for my husband hoping I would get one too. Fortunately, I didn't!Although it holds a large amount of CDs, the overlapping of the flaps is somewhat cumbersome. They are held together with velcro. If you have any CDs in the bottome section, the top doesn't completely secure to the bottom velcro leaving a portion of the pokey side exposed. This always get stuck on my husbands hat and when I drive, it tangles in my hair.This is a great idea, but it still has some improving that needs to be done."
4,Solid supplement,"Good supplement, lots of new spells, new prestige classes, some of which no doubt my players will use in our existing and new campaigns. also, some of the prepared material draws from this so a good book to have if there's a good deal on it."
2,"Eh, it's not bad","Not too much in this book impressed me. I really like the Warlock class, anda lot of the new spells are brilliant (and compliment Complete Mage well, too), but all the spells were reprinted in Spell Compendium. The feats are pretty lackluster, the monsters are mostly by-products of the prestige classes, and the prestige classes aren't so special in their own right. So really, it's just the warlock then. Whatever, I got it with Christmas money."
3,a so-so resource for magic users,"this and the complete mage are both pretty alright books if you have the extra oney to spend. i completely recomend the spell compendium though, much better work. this book is like the 2nd edition AD&D complete wizard updated and split up into two books (this and the complete mage) neither of which are great. don't get me wrong, I am glad it sits on my shelf, but it sits on my shelf more than i use it. it has some decent feats and prestige classes. get it cheap from a seller if possible."
4,wowsa-is warlock overpowered or what?,"I play regularly in a mid-high level game, (12-15) and my buddy comes in one day raving about warlocks. I read through the book, and lem'me tell ya, im glad he's only hung up on the eldritch blast. The imbue item power, by itself, is enough to make this class overpowered. I made a character with duel wand wielding, (another new feat herein), and he turned into a gunfighter with as many and as diverse a wand as he wanted. If you're a power gamer and you really wanna piss your dm off, the warlock class is for you. It has the ability at third level to be abused via the normal incantations. Darkness and Devil's Sight is as vicious a pairing on any tabletop since that whole Celerity thing in vampire."
2,SHOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED TOME AND BLOOD 3.5,"If you bought Tome and Blood before Wizards decided to change 3.0 to 3.5, you already own Complete Mage, pretty much. The feats are the same, the artwork is the same, the only add ons are culled from other books and magazines, basically a reprint all around. The book has the Warlock in it, a class where you can do ranged touch attacks with spell-like augmentations at will in an energy type that has no ER to counter it. Neat. In a sick, out-of-balance way. Run one of these at equal level against a party of 10th or higher and watch them cry when the EXP is so low. I would think facing a 20th level lich with a few minions would be desirable over dealing with a 16th level Warlock with the same minions!Not the worse buy you could make if you don't have Tome and Blood, the Feats are really good, but certainly not worth the price tag. If you can get it for $10 on EBay you'll be better off."
2,"Might be good, but all the $$$ necessary for D&D is lame","Here's why D&D; supplements (ie SPLAT books) are good:If you want a lot of extra rules, occasionally some good new optiosn, and the ability for your players to make characters that are overpowered -- without a single magic item. And when the overpowered characters DO get an item, look out!Here's why they suck:I'm happy they pumped the Wizards & Sorcerors... but if you buy the D&D; game, you're looking at hundreds of dollars of books.The whole system needs to be revamped. A roleplaying game shouldn't cost players, GM's, or fans hundreds of dollars.Players & GM's, go find a cheaper yet also good RPG like Call of Cthulhu, Amber Diceless, Paranoia, Hackmaster, ShadowRun, etc. Or just DON'T buy all the expansions!!!"
3,average,the book is average containing only one interesting class and an interesting campain for arcane users but the mosters abd the spells are disapointing
1,I find this book miserable.,"I know many will disagree with me, but this is simply my reaction as a player.I loved Complete Warrior, but as I am more likely to play a mage type character, I picked this book up. I am quite dissapointed. There isn't a single Prestigue Class or Feat I find useful for my characters. I understand that each player has his or her own style of play, but it seems my style isn't suited for Complete Arcane. Also I find the art abominable. Yes, the artists are much more talented than I, but I simply don't enjoy the art they produce. Really, this book was a disapointment, because when I shell out over $20 on a new splat book, I feel like I should be getting my money's worth."
1,Total Trash,"An excellent prop to steady a wonky coffee table, prepare to be dissappointed as there is little favorable that can be said of this book apart from a few moderately interesting prestige classes, a handful new magic items and relitively little else.Considered in totality i found it to be of marginal utility to players or GMs and believe much of the information here to be unbalanced with the existing framework of the game. Everything within the book is presented in the context of being bigger and better than before. I had hoped the book would embrace diversity and develop new (original) concepts that were well thought through and balanced against the existing infrastructure. I firmly believe wizards of the coast have failed to maintain the integrity of the D&D; branding on this product. Setting your cash on fire and savoring the brief warmth of the flames is likely to be a more rewarding and enjoyable experience than purchasing this book."
2,Very bland,"These might mean well, but I found the seeds to be very bland. NO SALT is added, which I did not realize when I bought them:( Also, you should note that they need to be refrigerated once opened. Not very convenient when taking them on trips or to the beach. These may be good on salads , but otherwise, I found them to be less than desirable. I guess a real health food nut would like these. I try to eat organic, all natural foods as much as I can. But, I can find much better tasting stuff than these seeds. On a positive note, sunflower seeds are among the healthiest foods you can eat. VERY good for you. I ended up giving almost all of this shipment to the food for the poor."
3,hard to sprout,These seeds taste OK but after soaking them they did not sprout well and so I wonder how fresh they are. The sunflower seeds I get from my natural foods store spout very well and cost about the same.
1,Awful; terrible; wretched,"So, I ordered a box with 12 bags of sunflower seeds. Sunflower seeds are healthy; they're rich in that ""good"" fat that lowers your cholesterol; and I think they're also rather tasty. This final adjective, however, doesn't describe Sunridge Farms' Organic Sunflower Seeds. I opened the first bag. Took a couple of bites and then spit them out. I tried a second bag. Same reaction. I wondered whether or not there was something wrong with my own taste, so I offered them to someone whose sense of taste I respect. She had the same reaction I had. In short, these sunflower seeds are inedible. It's like chewing on rancid, tasteless cardboard. I threw out the entire shipment. There are far better options available."
1,allergens not listed correctly on amazon,"I think the allergy statement on this page is REALLY MISLEADING. It only warns about peanuts and tree nuts, when actually the package also mentions a number of other allergens that these sunflower seeds were exposed to. If there was no allergen statement, I would have contacted the manufacturer to find out the allergen statement for this product. But because there is allergen info in the description on Amazon, I assumed that it was the complete list, so I went ahead and ordered these, only to find out that actually these ""may contain"" wheat and other allergens. My family is very allergic to wheat. So now we've got a ton of useless sunflower seeds. I think the description of this product should contain either a current allergen listing, or no allergen listing, but not an incomplete one -- that's misleading."
1,Crap - That's the only way to describe it,"For $10 dollars what do you expect. The pleather case doesn't fit. The car charger works good. So, if you want a cheap car charger and don't care about the ear piece or case then this a great deal."
2,Only the car charger is usable,The case is garbage and I ended up getting a blue tooth headset. The car charger works fine. At least it was not an expensive lesson and I got something useful out of the mix.
3,Good and bad,"The ear bud is GREEAT to have, however it fell apart after a month (I was able to fix it with some glue, but still). The leather case interfeared with camera use so I stopped using it. The car adapter didn't work in my car, but I think that's the car's problem (rusty unused lighter)."
2,"Car charger unreliable, cell phone case doesnt fit","Car charger may or may not work ocassionaly.Cell phone case is not designed for this cell phone, it's a generic one and mine just doesnt fit in it. I ended up buying another case. and it had an extremely low material!"
4,Great Deal,Pros:-Great Charger-Angled design on Car Power Charger works good for tight situations.-Case is customized for the product.Cons:-Cheap Earpiece (never used because I have a bluetooth headset)-Case sometimes covers camera lense when taking pictures.
2,Get what you pay for.,I opted to buy this instead of going through the motorola store. Quality of the chargers is bad but works. The case will tear on the plastic and the metal will tear through the leather in the clip area. Pass this up and just pay the money for a good set of items.
3,Interesting fusin,This was new music to me so I listened with an open mind. I enjoyed the fusion of Brazilian with classic.
1,Its not available so how can we rate it!,I have been trying to add this TV to my wedding registry forever and its been unavailable for so long! How can someone rate the TV if its never available?
4,Pleasures Unkown by Maria Isabel Pita,"An erotic read that explores the metaphysical. Slow at times but ""deep"" and thoughtful. Would recommend for ""deep"" thinkers."
4,Contemporary erotica .... what to do while you're in a coma,"This book first published in 2003 the author takes us on a flight of fancy as the heroine, Maia lies in a coma after a terrible traffic accident. I was a little surprised that the young country doctor caring for the comatose Maia wasn't the subject of this wonderfull authors erotic musings since she does hint that the doctors attentions were less than professional ...The story is interesting as Maia enters into a sensual dream where she allows herself to be attracted to two men, one an artistic carpenter and the other a rock nusician.... Meanwhile, back at the ranch .... Maia's parents enlist the help of a Druid priest to try to get Maia out of her coma and back into the real world ....The author certainly has a penchant for describing the secret dreams/lives of young women today ....."
1,Steer clear of iHateSpam and Sunbelt Software!!,"I purchased iHateSpam based on a review I saw in a magazine, only to discover that this product dumped all of my emails (some 2 years worth!!), and caused Outlook to lock up permanently. I called their customer service a few days ago and got the run around, and they told me there was nothing they could do, and that I would have to reformat and reinstall Windows 98!! Thanks for the help guys!! I also discovered that this company is known for their spam - I guess it's otherwise known as JOB SECURITY!!"
3,AWESOME? Not quite!,"After using this software for a few weeks I can tell you it does a good job of filtering out 95% of the spam and putting it in a folder when used in Outlook. It has a terrible system of reporting that makes no sense and if you hate spam you'll really hate 2 - 3 auto responces from AOL, Yahoo, Prodigy, MSN etc. for each spammer you report! So the program filters your e-mail. If you use Outlook, you can already do that! Since I began reporting spammers I get 10 times the spam I used to...I wonder why? No, I would not buy this software again. I'd just use the filter already in Outlook."
1,I Despise I Hate Spam!,"I bought and installed I Hate Spam on Outlook Express. In spite of careful setting of filters, it continues to place good mail in 'Deleted' and put garbage in my 'Inbox'. But, that is not the worst of it!! I have uninstalled it from my computer and it CONTINUES to interfere with my email and delete my good mail. I CAN'T GET RID OF IT!!I Hate ""I Hate Spam""."
4,I Hate Spam,This has worked great. I use both the outlook and Outlook express versions. I typically get 25-40 spams a day and now I only have to go through 2 or 3.
1,BUYER BEWARE: Doesn't work with ActiveSync!,"Although IHateSpam! works OK, buyer BEWARE: If you have a PocketPC and use ActiveSync, this will render your capability to sync your messages/contacts/etc. nill. IT DOES NOT WORK WITH ACTIVESYNC, without doing silly things like starting Outlook ahead of syncing, or turning off IHateSpam! before you do your sync. If it were not for this problem, the product would be very useful; but for those with PocketPCs it is virtually useless.What bugs me is that Sunbelt software is and has been aware of this for some time, yet so far no fix is available. I had previously used CloudMark SpamNet with Outlook and it had NO problems whatsoever with ActiveSync. This situation leaves me with a bad feeling toward the company... If they cannot fix this kind of problem (which other software doesn't have) then what kind of support do they have for their product?"
1,I Goofed! Buyer must read ALL the requirements!,I didn't read everything and wound up with a program I can't use. This program DOES NOT work with AOL. Be aware of this before you buy!
3,"Limited support for Outlook Express, no support for Netscape","Nearly all the features of this program are limited to uses of OUTLOOK (the big brother to Outlook Express). Outlook Express users are limited to an automation of the existing Blocked Senders List function. Outook Express users could, in fact, save their money, use the Blocked Senders List, edit the blocked senders down to their domains, and achieve the same spam-blocking results (~80%).Outlook users should seriously consider this program. Outlook Express users should consider the McAfee program. Netscape users, Eudora users, and all others cannot use this program as only Microsoft Outlook/Outlook Express are supported."
2,"Nice idea, but it doesn't work","I uninstalled this program because I ended up spending more time dealing with it than it took simply to delete spam messages every morning. It is not capable of detecting messages with forged headers and does not provide an option for automatically deleting messages from foreign countries, which constitute a tremendous amount of the spam I receive."
3,Good Software with a Few Hitches,"I get a decent amount of spam, so I was very excited about this product. Though the software is good overall, I did have a few problems with it.The good:- The software does a good job and the interface is intuitive.- The bounce feature is very nice.The bad:- Even after downloading updates from their site and wading through their knowledge base, I was initially unable to resolve ""Outlook has performed an illegal operation"" messages as Outlook tries to shut down. I finally fixed this problem by updating Outlook.- I had to disable the automatic update during startup feature because, even with a fast Internet connection, Outlook loaded very slowly. Even with this feature disabled, Outlook loads slowly.- Synchronizing my Palm and Outlook 2000 used to work flawlessly. Now I have to disable iHate Spam to synchronize.Summary:This software is definitely good and useful overall. The few problems I have with it are merely annoyances."
5,"""The best in Mexico""",""".... Since we are using this software all emails are welcome here in my company...."""
1,Sunbelt Software are themselves spammers,"How ironic that Sunbelt Software (the makers of this software), are themselves spammers. They own and operate Winxpnews, a newsletter that I never subscribed to and can't seem to get unsubscribed from. Their software may be good but I'd rather drive nails through my kneecaps then contribute financially to spammers. You shouldn't either."
2,Good software if your are patient,"I bought IHateSpam a few months ago, and I had lots of problems. Finally I got to make it work, but it seems that the filtering process slows down Outlook. I first tried to uninstall the automatic software update, eliminated some filters, etc.But IHateSpam kept kept crashing Outlook, so I ended spending lots of times every day restarting outlook.I have uninstalled it and I am now manually deleting my spam, while IHateSpam works out on how to make their software more efficient.If they resolve those problems I would install the software again."
2,"If you use Outlook Express, look elsewhere","I can't complain about the price! But it was only when the product arrived that I discovered the filter is tuneable if you use Outlook, but not if you use Outlook Express. Since I prefer to stay with Outlook Express, IHateSpam's place is the circular file. Well, I guess I can use the CD for a coaster.Of course, if you want to go for the ""Best Value"" offer of IHateSpam for free bundled with Outlook 2002..., that's another matter!"
1,Bummer,I was very disappointed to learn after receiving my merchandise that is is not compatible with AOL.
1,iHateSpam,No better then the block that is part of Outlook Express. I think this is a waste of money.
1,Only catches half the spam,"This software only catches half the spam I get. When it misses emails with text such as ""Banned government CD"" I have to wonder if they guys are updating their software at all."
2,At least the price is low,"I was very disapointed with this product. Missed about half of my spam and performed poorer than the freeware solutions I had been using.The interface is easy to use but if it isn't going to catch the spam, what's the point? The highly promoted ""learning network"" seemed to lend no improvement at all to this software. I would suggest people shell out some more money for Cloudmark's Spamnet rather than waste their money on a product that offers almost no improvement at all.The only good thing is that it generated very few false positives."
2,"Works, but crashes (is unstable)","""IHateSpam"" filters do a marvelous job of detecting spam content, and with the right settings, give zero false positives. That's the good news.The bads news is, it is unstable. Filtering is erratic in that sometimes, it forgets to filter, and other times it leaves out folders you have selected for auto-cleaning.The other problem is the ""crashing"". It would get to a point, that clicking absolutely anything after getting your mail, would cause Outlook to simply close. Clicking the button that dumps the spam would do the same thing. Ultimately, my only option was to remove the program.I did re-install, and after a few days of use, the same problems would occurr again. I have notified Sunbelt and will report on any solutions they may have.I use Windows XP and have a very stable system, and Dell equipment."
3,"Some good, some bad","I got it to work, and it seems to filter out a lot of junk email.. sometimes it does let a couple through, and filter out ones I want, but once I add them to friends list, it works fine. Now the bad part.. it's true what some people have said about this program, it crashes outlook. I sometimes have to kill the Outlook via task manager and restart the program. Lately the program has gotten buggy.. why I have no clue.. Now it's not even working even though I installed the latest version. I hope they come up with a fix for their problems because i do like this program for what I've seen, but if it doesn't work, then it's worthless."
2,Table not made very well,This table is not made very well made but it matches my existing furniture. When I received the table one of the drawers were broken. I contacted the company and they sent a replacement part which was also broken. They eventually sent me an unbroken replacement part.
3,"came on time, but table was broken in several places","The table came on time, but one corner was smashed in and two of the drawers were broken. I repaired it myself because I thought the table was nice enough to keep."
4,Excellent Commentary on Aristotle's Poetics,"For my money, it is the commentary by O. B. Hardison, Jr. that is the selling point for this text. Students of literature and creative writing will benefit from Hardison's insightful commentary, which makes up the larger part of the book."
3,Price too high,"Hi,I agree with the other reviewer, the price is just too high for something this old. Yes, it is a good series, but why so expensive? What idiot sets these prices? Some greedy executive somewhere I guess."
3,a dvd is better,"buying a streaming video is sucha waste of money. One view and the movie is done, ten dollars gone and no product in your possession to share ar view again througha different medium. I consider this an expensive lesson learned"
5,excellent,I watched all the series and enjoyed them. I highly recommend all the series. My Kindle is the best and I would recommend it highly.
5,Entertaining and Devastating,"This Mystery Series is not only entertaining from a viewing point of view, but it is extremely enlightening as to the struggles, privations, daily suffering of the citizens of England during WW II. It shows the terrible tragic results of War. We have hadtwo many Wars. We tend not to think about all the suffering on both sides. One has deeper appreciation for the Brits during this period. Too many have suffered, and died hoping to end all Wars, only to have their own children die in Another!"
2,Not too happy.,I received this hard cover book that looked like it had been in a world war. It had no artwork cover to show the title nor a introduction in the beginning. Very unhappy.
2,old,the picture is not clear. i guess it was because of the time the film was shot. it looks old. i think it is a film of the 60's.
2,"Poor, but an okay price","This is a rather poor session for Jimmy. Both CDs have been released several times in different collections and under different names. The first CD just seems to drag and does not challenge Page by any means. The second is a little better, but that is simply because it has ""One Long Kiss,"" which is long, but grooves compared to everything else, which is jerky. If you own neither of these discs and are a completist, then by all means step up. If otherwise, shy away. This earned two stars which were maily attributed to the good price for two CDs."
2,Definately NOT:,How I am used to hearing Jimmy Page (I even asked the double question one time as to Who's the better guitarist Jimmy Page of Led Zepplin or Joe Perry of Aerosmith fame) (this is just session playing) and after hearing this I would have to say Joe Perry because you can't really hear Page in this stuff because it sounds muddled like something out of the 1920's or 30's - But I digress after seeing him in the Led Zepplin concert video which he painstakingly restored himself then I would put him out as the winner and especially after hearing him in the 3 cd version of 'How The West Was Won' by Led Zepplin. - [...]
4,My 23 month old LOVES this!,"I've never been a Barney fan, but my daughter loves him, she sings along, dances and is learning to count.She got the Learn Through Music Player for her first birthday and so far we have bought all the cartridges we can find. Unfortunately that seems to be limited to 4 - and the Elmo/Sesame Street came with the player. I really hope they come out with new cartridges.**ETA I found more! search for ""Learn Through Music""! Yay!**rant**It says in the description ""Requires Learn Through Music Player"" and the item title says ""CARTRIDGE"". How do you miss that?"
5,Full of Grace in every way,I watch David Jerimah on TV and I have some tapes. I find his books are written in a such manner that you could actually hear him seaking the book to you.
3,"Good book, but concerned about one thing...","Overall, I enjoyed this book, and I definitely got a lot out of it. However, in a few moments, there was a suggestion of something that just made me feel uncomfortable. For example, this line ""Have you been excusing sin in your life by calling it another name?"" goes on to say that perhaps your ""unfortunate trait,"" ""weakness,"" or ""unproductive habit"" is actually sin. Well, having known a lot of people who suffer from addictions, biochemical disorders, and other medical issues, this passage made me uneasy. Yes, sin can be a result of this things, but not the cause. Although Dr. Jeremiah doesn't quite come out and say that sin causes these issues, he comes close enough to implying it to make me feel uneasy.I could be misinterpreting what is being said here, and I welcome the thoughts of Dr. Jeremiah's team, but I do know that, as much as I enjoyed the book, these passages would make me hesitant to recommend it."
4,Amazed by Grace...,This book had me trying to find time to get even more reading in. I was captured the authors explanation of grace and what it means for us! I would definitely recommend this book to all. Its such a great reminder to us in all walks of life.
3,okay,"Captured by GraceA Thomas Nelson Book ReviewI have to be honest, this book took me forever to read and most books don't. I just couldn't get into it. I love the idea of grace and I really love David Jeremiah, but this one wasn't my favorite. It might just be that this season in my life is overwhelmed by lots of good books and this one did not rank high on my list. It is biblically accurate of course and the truths are more than relevant for this time period. I do like how he used John Newton's song of Amazing Grace as his outline. Creative and powerful. The bottom line is grace is available to all of us every single day. The only question is will we accept it.Again, I really like David Jeremiah. Some of his other books recently have been more powerful to me than this. Just my opinion."
2,Lacking in theology and history,"Recently, I read Captured by Grace, by David Jeremiah. This was the first book I had ever read by this author. The title and brief description grabbed my attention. I had high hopes that this book would be written-well, grasp my attention, and overwhelm me with the richness of God's grace. Sadly, it failed on all three accounts.The book was very difficult to ""get into."" The paragraphs did not seem to flow smoothly. I found it to be theologically- and historically-famished. So much more could have been written. However, there was one ""highlight"" for me. The chapter that focuses on the story of the prodigal son interestingly points out the true focus of the story -- the forgiving father. This had never really occurred to me and I appreciated this chapter's direction. Other than that, I found the book a very difficult read. There are so many other books rich in the truths of God's grace to choose from. I would highly recommend picking one of those rather than this book."
3,Captured by Grace,The concept behind this book is to show how no one is beyond the reach of a loving God. Dr. Jeremiah use the stories of Saul of Tarsus and John Newton among others to demonstrate this. I will be honest....I had a really hard time getting into this book. I don't know if it is Dr. Jeremiah's writhing style or what but I struggled to spend time in this book. I think the message is great and there is no doubt that we need to know we are never beyond God's reach. This particular book just didn't hold my interest long enough to engage me deeply on that topic.
5,perfect bag,"I've been using this bag for over a year and I love it. I can turn it into a little makeshift hip bag by shortening the strap and hooking it around my waist and because there's a bit of room left after my Canon S70 slips in, I can keep my phone, some cash and even lippy along with an extra battery, sim card and the connector all in the bag together.It's got just the right amount of padding so when I drop it, the camera's okay. I always zip it so the camera's wrist strap is hanging out of the zipper so I can get to the camera easier - but maybe that's just me and a little obsessiveness.If you have an S70, I definitely recommend this bag - for other cameras, it's probably good as well as long as it says your camera will fit!"
4,Smart and Sassy,"Here is a lady who not only talks the talk, but has walked it as well! Think this might only be for the small marketing business, well guess again. I'm hoping all you 'big' guys also plan on buying this for your company. Everyone needs a good laugh, and when you can learn some valuable tools as well, then you have a great '2 for 1' deal."
4,A Lost Treasure Found!,"I remembered this music from many years ago. I thought it out-of-print, and was shocked to find it via amazon.com. The music? Well, Mr. Tate didn't have a great voice. But two of the songs have haunted my memory for years: ""Would You Believe"" and ""Sack Full of Dreams"". Obviously, there is a lot to be said for style!"
2,Not as Pictured in the on-line advertisement,Pictured as including a 5-position length guide and a V-trim detail guide. Instead it comes with one single-length guide. Useless for precision and custom trimming.
2,SCREEN BLACKS OUT MOMENTARILY DURING FLASHES,"SOME OF MY SHOWS,WHETHER ITS A DIGITAL RECORDING,VCR TAPE OR LIVE TV,BLACKS OUT FOR AN INSTANT AND DOES IT EVERY TIME DURING THE 90210 SHOW INTRO.....PLUS THIS UNIT ALSO DOES NOT HAVE INTERNAL S-VIDEO SWITCHING,SO WHEN YOU HOOK IT UP COMPOSITE VIDEO NO LONGER WORKS.PLUS MOST CABLE BROADCASTS DONT HAVE A HIGH RESOLUTION SO THE PICTURE ONLY LOOKS GREAT ON SOME SHOWS.....PHOOOEY!"
5,Amazing....,"A real Mahlerite should have both this and the Bruno Walter version of the work....But if you want just one...or don't know were to begin, this is it ! The last movement is heard as in nowhere else....The big ""gong..."" anounces death comming, and it is imposible not to be touched ! Needless to say that Ludwig and Wunderlich interpretations are superb....The old Klemperer really got to the point of the work.... The sound quality is perfect !"
5,"My favorite ""Das Lied Von der Erde""","If had to I to have just one version of ""Das Lied von der Erde"", I'd probably choose this one. The singing is first-rate and the recorded sound is excellent.The wonderful Walter/Ferrier/Patzak version is my second choice. The recorded sound is mono but it a wonderful interpretation.Those are my two favorite recordings of ""Das Lied."""
5,Inspiring & Awesome!,"This is a great book! This book combines personal experience with professionalism, making the book an educational and pleasurable read. Search and rescue is a pursuit I hope to involve myself with in the future."
4,Inspirational,"Interesting, entertaining, and inspiring -- the true adventures of a dedicated woman and her even more dedicated search and rescue dogs. This is a read that really pulls at the heartstrings!"
5,my favorite scent,"I love this scent. It makes me feel good! It is light but sexy. It is not overpowering in any way, so I even wear it to work. I spray it on every morning to start the day off feeling good. They say that scents can affect your mood - well this one in particular really makes me feel great."
1,Me thinky it's stinky :),"I'd never smelled it, hope I never smell it again. Sorry Sarah Jessica, it's not lovely!"
2,This perfume already exists!,"And it's called ""Narcisso Rodriguez"". Buy the NR, you'll like it a whole lot more."
2,Blech,"I was warned by friends before that this smelled really bad, well I sprayed my whole hand with it anyway. The bottle is pretty, the gray ribbon tester is pretty, Sarah is pretty too but the scent is horrendous.It smells like some lovely old moth eatten socks under dust bunny attack.Im a fan of Sarah Jessica, but the perfume is totally off for me. I love floral and woody tones, but this just smells like dirt."
1,Not so lovely : (,"Well i dint like the smell at all, i see nothing lovely about this perfum, if ur looking for a good perfume to give this holiday season, check out Fantasy by Britney Spears it smells so nice, or Curious by Britney thats a classic its a must give or have, J.Lo's Live smells really nice too so if i was you i would rather not buy it if ur giving it as a present,or for urself its not really worth ur money!"
1,ry disappointed !,"VERY strong, heavy scent, smells like old lady perfume...tied to get used to it, used multiple times, still dislike ;)"
3,Smelled very horsey,It smells very much like horse. (Equus ferus caballus) A strange kind of synthetic and finally horsey woodiness with the horse pungency.
4,perfume,"Everything was fine with the order,gave it to a friend,because it wasn't meant for me,she loved it .Thank you for the prompt delivery and packing was good also."
3,Good one,"I bought it to my mother two year ago and He liked a lot, She bought it a couple times after that she commented it is good and that I chose correctly."
3,Ok Fragrance,The fragrance smells nice at first but then during the day it smelled like a totally different perfume. It could be the chemical make up of my body since everyone's us unique but overall it's an ok scent.
1,Not lovely,"I bought this based on the several positive reviews. Really, I dislike this perfume. It was a waste of money for me and couldn't bear to use it more than twice. I'd never buy it again."
1,vivals,I ordered this product but I don't believe this was worth the money and the cost of s & h was too high.........
5,VERY GOOD,I just got this video and its Awesome!It teaches you how to dance like a professional belly dancer! It even shows you egyptian hand moves etc.Its a little fast paced I have to admit!But yet its still good.The girls are very nice.I bought this video along with Exotic Dancing for Every Day Women which I REALLY Love but these two together I am making up my own dance routine which is really good! If you get these two videos you will be one sexy dancer!
1,Not a good workout and they can't teach dance,"To begin with, you cannot get a good workout by doing this video. They stop and start so often that you never get going.Secondly, doing the ""dance"" at the end is extemely difficult. They teach you all the components of the dance routine seperately first and then expect you to put them together in an instant to do the full dance. Not gonna happen."
3,Intermediated bellydance,"You should definietly practice the ""Basic Dance"" DVD before doing this one. A good way to learn to bellydance if you are too embarrassed to go to a class."
5,Challenging but great instruction,"I found this tape to be a great instruction for more difficult moves , that are not found in beginner tapes.I think the instructions in these tapes are the most complete and easy to understand than in most other belly dance instructional videos. Neena and Veena are always shown at full body view,and turn sideways to show further instruction to some movements.They show footwork , and one nice thing is that they do not wear overwhelming costumes so you are allowed to see the movements without obstruction."
5,Super system for the money,"I shopped a long time before settling on the Sharp XL-55. This unit is very simple to use, sounds better than most systems costing several times the price, and is smaller than most. The added benefit of the cassette deck for us old-timers is a big plus. The included speakers sound pretty good, but I'm gonna upgrade mine to a set of Bose. Reception is pretty good, not great.Pros:Simplicity of a single CD playerCassette deck w/logic controlsActual bass/treble controls, not preset EQ!!Small enough to actually sit on a 12"" shelfSimple, logical remote controlRotary volume control, not push-buttonCons:Cassette deck's ""Pause"" button disabled in some modesNo ""Scan"" on the tuner, so switching to non-presetstations is tedious.External antenna connection doesn't accept rooftopantenna wireAt $200, this would be a 4-star system, but for under $100, WOW! I am thoroughly pleased."
5,Funny Performance,I've always enjoyed this performance immensely. I'm suspecting more and more some of the singers are having some fun saying some things subtly in English. My neighbor is a doctor ... equal rights for women?
5,Towering and profound.....,Klemperer was a big man and I have yet to hear a recording where musicians have sounded so stately and play with such breadth and grandeur as do these people. I would not dare say that this reading is even incomparable; it stands alone. Such immense forces in my listening experiences have never performed with such compassion and profundity. This is must to add to any CD library. This is an immensely satisfying recording.
5,I feel so calm when listening to this,"Although I'm just a music fan, I only can tell you that this is one of the most beautiful compositions I've ever heard. The performance is brilliant, the recording is superb, and I feel very relaxed and in peace with our cruel and merciless world when I listen this chorus, this music created from the goodness of human being.I can only talk about my sensations when I have the chance of listening to this music; I can't give you a reviewer point of view but, all in all, most of you are looking for peace and happiness when you attend to a concert or make your hi-fi set play.I wish you to enjoy it, like I do.Greetings."
5,Death Conquered,"While somber in its subject, Brahms does not leave his hearers in the hopelessness of death. It is true that all flesh is as grass. It is also true that the the Word our God endures forever. That word is the Word of Life Who brings eternal life to all who believe in Him.I encourage listeners who do not understand German to obtain a translation."
4,Masterpiece,I have enjoyed listening to this masterpiece. I was a little disappointed in the overall volume level of the tracks.
2,Discovering the obvious,"This is a strange book. A left-leaning reporter is sent to Iraq to find stories about how aweful the U.S. occupation is but actually ""discovers"" that things aren't as black-and-white as people assume. Of course, there is a wide variety of experiences and opinions about the merits of the U.S. occupation (or lack thereof).Why I think this book is strange is: I assumed from the title and the background of the author that this was supposed to be a critical account of U.S. policy in Iraq. While reading it, however, I started thinking that maybe the U.S. presence isn't going as badly as people (such as the author's employer, Pacifica Radio) would have us believe.I gave it 2 stars not for ideological or political reasons but just because I didn't think the book was very well written. If you want to read about the Iraqi occupation, I'm sure there are better books out there more worth your time (and mine).Not terrible but not recommended."
5,Balanced,Glantz punctures both left and right in this balanced analysis of what has gone wrong in Iraq. A powerful story that should be required reading for politicians and political groupies of all leanings.
5,Winning a battle in 2003 but losing the war,"If one were to look at the Iraq War only in terms of the first 6 months in 2003, they'd think we won the war. That of course is what Bush and his neo-conservative buddies in both the Republican and Democrat Parties want you to think about. However, now that the Iraq War makes Vietnam look less bloody what with more insurgents on the horizon and more moderate and liberal and even good conservative Iraqi citizens losing their faith in the new regime which was actually a neocon puppet installed regime after the war and Saddham captured, the longer the war prevails with smaller chances of any true success in Iraq and oil prices skyrocketing, this book will no doubt strengthen in its validity."
5,Great for toddlers,My twin daughters are in preschool and really like this puzzle. It keeps them occupied and they learn much from it.
3,Nice puzzles. Pieces too narrow,"The puzzles are cute. The word choice is great. However, the puzzles are VERY small so each puzzle piece is VERY narrow. Almost shredder size narrow. So it becomes a challenge for a toddler, never mind the matching/spelling aspect. I'm surprised that none of the reviewers mentioned it. Did Infantino reduce the puzzles size over the years? Had the puzzles been bigger it would have been a five star toy."
4,Nice Puzzles,The puzzle pieces seem quite durable and they are appropriate length for toddlers and up! The only drawback is that sometimes the pieces can match up multiple ways.
5,Cute puzzles for kids,1 year old & 3 year old are enjoying these puzzles! Fun little box full of Learning. I actually split up the puzzles to keep in different parts of the house & in my purse.
5,Beauty and Innocence,"This is one of those rare albums you can listen to for hours on end and never tire of--every track, every note, blows a fresh happy gust of cheer into the room.Brain's virtuosity is so admirable here, it inspired me to take up the horn. But then I put it back down, when I realized I didn't know how to play it."
5,His horn is immortal,"I first heard this recording of Dennis Brain on an Angel long playing record when I was in high school on the island of Aruba in 1960. To hear the beautifully haunting sounds in the Music Appreciation class of Mr. Jan Koulman and then to learn that the musician who made this exquisitely ethereal music had died, just three years earlier, was a haunting lesson in mortality for an impressionable young girl. All of my lifetime I have been touched by the sounds of Dennis Brain's horn. These concerti have been companions when I was very happy and when I have been tremendously sad...the music made by Dennis Brain can celebrate or it can soothe...but, it never fails to touch my soul. As long as there are copies of these recordings and human hearts to be reached by the music written by Mozart and brought to life by Dennis Brain, they both will be immortal...and humankind forever enriched."
5,Mozart: Horn Concert,"Great recordings of the century, and that is what it is.Herbart von Karajan conducting, and Dennis Brain on horn tells it all; a wonderful rich music experience are waiting for you.In my ears its probably one of the best recordings ever made of the horn concert. And even though its from the mid 50`s it comes in a wonderful remastered CD.The CD comes with a very good booklet in English; telling the story behind the record.I highly recommend this album"
3,Gets the job done adequately,"I bought this because I live in a chalet-style house that has several huge windows, and a ceiling fan, that are very high up and this was the only sufficiently long pole I could find. I thought it was fairly expensive for what it is. But, this is one of those things that are worth it only because not having it is worse. Still, it is overpriced for its quality & features. Not that a pole can have very many features. But that just makes the lack of them more concerning. First, there are no markings on the pole to indicate when you are coming to the end of the extensions. Thus, one section often separates from the next. It's easy to put back, but still... Next, although it's aluminum, it isn't especially light, and, despite its weight, when extended, it flexes too much. It's somewhat like trying to use a pole vaulter's pole to clean with. So, in sum, the pole reaches higher than any other pole I was able to find, but isn't very easy to use."
5,Must have if you have 2 stories or high ceilings,"I was almost put off by the price, but I wanted an extension pole for my Windex kit. I live in a two story house with high windows and high ceilings. For years I used my cheap solution of screwing or taping broomstick handles together, but it turns out this pole fits many of the accessories I already use, not just the ones sold by this company. It seems light enough to me and is adjustable, so no more dealing with tape. Now I can wash my second floor windows myself in addition to dusting in high places.I think this will be very useful for many years to come and so it turned out to be a great household investment. I love the color too."
3,Not all that,"This album is not its all hyped up to be. I first heard of this Kamikaze cat when he performed down here at college night. The album seems too local, I mean all he talks about is Atlanta this, Atlanta that so I mean Im lost half of the album. I'll give it him, he can rhyme but whats the use of making an album if you are only going to talk about your own neighborhood. I'm not hatin but thats just how I see it."
4,Southside,"When I first heard his song with T-Rock in a club down here I was like his album probably gonna be tight as hell. But um, yea...When I first heard I really didnt like them beats he had. I mean a few was tight but some of them was like, not good. But my firend was like you gotta listen to what he saying and after I listen to the album a couple more times I kind of got in to it. But I swear if them beats was better every body in the SOuth would be bumpin this CD."
4,Good for Understanding Addictions,"This book is ideal for understanding addictions in the family and the dynamics that play before, during and after sobriety. All though the authors don't focus on the causes of alcoholism but in the process that occurs in the family, they do mention factors that could potentially lead to alcoholism. This book is a hard read, and should not be rushed. The book is over 24 years old and is written from a feminist perspective if you can look beyond that it is a good book for clinical work for individual, family and group therapy. Heavily promotes Alcoholics Anonymous, Al-Anon, Alateen and other groups that help the individual to their own path of recovery and help to break the pride of both the alcoholic and co-alcoholic."
3,Not as good as I was hoping,"By the time I received this book, I had already done all my research from the internet. This book is really very basic. It's helpful for the ULTIMATE beginner to homeschooling. But for anyone who knows anything beyond the mere basics, I wouldn't really recommend it."
2,"Nice Pic, about as reliable as a 1986 Yugo; BEWARE!!","My wife and I were excited at finding such a good TV at a semi-reasonable price ($1900); we had owned a Toshiba 26 inch for 11 years without a hitch. Much like the some of the other reviews, about two months after we bought it; POP! The screen went blank. After a week and a half of waiting, Toshiba sent out repair people and fixed it. They replaced something they called a reflection board. Then, a month later; POP! Same problem. No picture, and now the part is on backorder. No one can tell us when it will arrive. I've been told to FAX a copy of our receipt to them and they will consider replacement. Why do I think that will take even weeks longer? We have a brand-new TV that refuses to work, and Toshiba is being zero help. SHAME on Toshiba for not recalling this piece of JUNK! DO yourself a favor; if you are looking to buy this TV, just keep on looking and save yourself a MAJOR headache!"
2,Good picture when not broken...,"I had this TV for less than a month and the picture was great. However, the HD picture went bad and the technician said it was a component call the Hyper-PCB Board. The part has been backordered by Toshiba for over three months now. They're not sure when the part will arrive, and there are so many backordered, I may have to wait for several batches to be produced and shipped."
2,"Bad internal components, acknowledged by Toshiba",Toshiba has admitted to their service reps that these tv's are defective and will need repair. I had the TV for 2 weeks and loved it! I had the TV apart now for another 2 weeks trying to get the parts to get it fixed. It isn't even like I can get a new one as it will have the same problem. This is horrible Toshiba should be ashamed of their service and sale of a defective product.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS TV!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"WE BOUGHT THIS TV IN 42 INCH AND AND WE WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER TOSHIBABRAND PRODUCT OF ANY KIND, THEY SENT OUT PEOPLE TO REPAIR A BRAND NEW TV & THEY PRETTY MUCH GUTTED THE TV AND REPLACED ALL PARTS, AFTER CONTINOUS POPPINGS AND THE MOTHER BOARD REPLACED AFTER CONSTANT FLICKERING AND IS STILL VERY FUZZY, THE ONLY TIME IT LOOKS GOOD IS WHEN A DVD IS PLAYED IN IT. TOSHIBA PRETTY MUCH HAS IGNORED US AND THEY WERE VERY RUDE AND I HAVE A FILE FULL OF REPAIRS TO THIS TV. WE WILL REPLACE THIS AND MOVE THIS TO THE BASEMENT OR GARAGE. I WOULD NOT EVEN GIVE THIS TV AWAY."
1,Stay Away,"Although I love Toshiba products and almost all my electronics are Toshiba, they blew it with this one. I was excited when I bought this right when the tv was released in Summer 2003. The first 6 months were awesome! great picture, sound, you name it. Then the picture went out, I've read about how widespread this problem is with this model, even my repair company has no clue when they will get the Scan Board part in, because it's been backordered. I called Toshiba, and the rep had no clue about anything widespread. Good waste of the $ I paid for it new."
3,Not bad... but not great.,"This product is not bad, but not great either. You can buy other products at a fraction of the costs that are just as (and even more) effective. No noticable improvement in my acne.This product leaves a slight cooling sensation on my skin (which I like). It also does not foam up as much as I prefer, and as a result I end up using more product then I should.I probably will NOT purchase again."
1,WHY,"I have no Idea why it picks who it wants to work for. It was the WORST **** I ever used on my face. I was having a bad forehead breakout so I used Murad because it was for sensitive skin. Well The next day I had three big pimples on my cheek. I had not ever had big painful pimples, but I had fell for it will get bad before it gets better. Well they hit it on the nose for getting bad but it been two months and I have had a new pimple everyday from tiny to huge. I usually heal quick but for some reason some of the pimples leave marks even if you do not touch. I have enough. EVEN a handful of members agreed on ACNE.ORG. I wish I did my research maybe I would have seem the lawsuits that they have had for the ****."
4,Great,"This product is great, I am currently deployed and have to deal with the elements drying my face out while my T-zone is oily. This product perfectly balances my skin; along with the Toner and the Skin Perfecting Lotion. The Skin Perfecting Lotion is actually the best product of the three, and has given me tremendous results. It gives the perfect amount of moisture and doesn't cause me to break out."
1,and I have tried everything,"I was using proactiv with ok, but not perfect, results. My friend recommended Murad, and since I respect her, I bought 2 kits (one for me and one for my sister) wasting about $200. It did not work for either of us, and made my acne much worse. My face was red and felt like it would explode. For some people it's better to use products with benzoyl peroxide (which is not in the Murad products, if I am not mistaken)."
5,Love it!,I have been using Murad Acne Clarifying Cleanser for about 5 years.Great stuff....especially on my adult skin. It's cleansing without being drying. A tube of this stuff lasts me 2-4 months. A little goes a long way.
1,Awful!!!,They should not be allowed to sell this stuff. If you only have moderate acne do not buy this! It caused major problems with my skin. Horrible experience.
1,repackaged junk,"this is a repackaging of CODENAME HAWKWIND which is a VERY poor quality set,save your money for real hawkwind"
1,BAD QUALITY DVD!,"Sorry to say this, but the DVD is NOT DVD quality. Far from it. At least the price was low."
4,Brief but gives you an idea,It is a pregrade book and it could help you to get a basic idea. Here you could find some good exercises.
4,Depends on what you're looking for,"Honestly, this didn't help me as much 'cause I was looking for more of a text to help boost my conceptual understanding. Although, it's great for worked problems and other exercises."
2,Not for college level,"This book does not cover the ideas studied in Griffiths ""Intro to Electrodynamics"" which is the most common college level book used for Electrodynamics. Very few of the problems are applicable to processes studied in class. This book should be used for a class like physics II, not advanced physics classes."
2,Not good for physics classes,"Almost every undergraduate course in the country uses Griffiths for E&M and this book compliments it poorly. It's written from an engineering perspective so there are plenty of examples, but very little material from which to gain a good understanding of the principles involved. Derivations are few, numbers in 10^-9 coulumbs all to common."
4,"""Every undergraduate in the country"" does not use Griffiths.",EVERY undergraduate in the country does not use Griffiths for E&M.
4,Very helpful while taking an undergraduate EMag course,"Schaum's Outlines are generally a little bit better in explaining theory on the subject the book is about. In this book, that might be lacking. So, by all means, this book is NOT a substitute for a textbook...BUT it has tons of worked problems and that really helps in a class like this one. For me, this book was very helpful. I still give it a thumbs up for that reason."
4,A stunning collection of French songs,"Fischer-Dieskau renders this collection of 19th century French art songs with stunning mastery, ably accompanied by Hartmut Holl. The songs range widely in style from the comic, to the lyric, to the bombastic, written by a ""who's who"" of 19th centry French composers and poets. This CD is a must for anyone who is interested in French language or art songs, or who enjoys the artistry of Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau."
3,Not Funny Any More,"We were so enthralled with David Letterman that we redefined our humor lexicon to include this form.Another reviewer expresses gratitude that we have preserved this form for our children. Here's a list forya:10. You bet your sweet bippy.9. Sock it to...me?8. I'll drink to that.7. Moving right along...6. To the moon, Alice!5. I'm growing tired..."
5,"A Masterpiece of Story, Photos and History","Right from the beautiful cover, this book is a must have for every angler and conservationist. A detailed history with the most inspirational photographs. Truly a work of genius by both writer and photographer"
2,Poor picture quality,"Did a bunch of research and decided to buy this tv. It is now 2 weeks later and it is going back to the store. The colors are great, but the picture is terrible. It is incredibly grainy, the pixels are HUGE and everything is very blocky. Watching any sports (main reason i bought the tv) is absolutely dreadful because the picture is so distorted, the players are just a big blur. I emailed toshiba support and they said that the pixelation was normal, not good. I went through every possible setting to find some clarity by custom tuning to no avail. You can not turn off the internal speaker, another downfall. I'm gonna get a samsung 27"" tv instead as the picture on it is incredibly clear and not blocky. Heads up with this tv if you are planning on buying it."
4,One of the best Histories of Indian Police,"This is undoubtedly one of the best histories of Indian Police. The emphasis is on the Indian Police since 1861 till Independance, though attempt has also been made to trace its roots from earlier times. The portions relating to Vedic and Ancient times leave much to be desired. Dr. A Gupta has done more justice to the ancinet Indian Police. Sir Percival was a member of the Indian Civil Service who served long years in India under the Raj and like many other illustrious member of the elite service, he has taken great pains to research into the history and culture of India. Though there are larger and more scholastic tomes on the subject, To Guard My People stands out as the most readable work so far."
3,Dry recording,"I heard the performance of ""In the Dragon's Garden"" in Pesaro in 1992 and it was a fascinating experience. Nathanson and Bongiorno are extreme specialists on their instruments.Having this in mind, ordering the CD Images, I must say that, to my regrets, this CD was a little disappointing. First because none of the played pieces equal the quality of the Dragon, second because the recording is so dry as if they are playing in a room with no acoustics at all. That's why this CD does not give the experience of a real performance."
1,"Save your money, absolute junk","I received this flower hood and adapter for Christmas after I specifically requested it. I thought it would be a good way to protect the lense from my fingers and other peoples. It does protect the lense (if you buy a clear filter to go on the front of it) but a Pringles can taped on the end would be just as effective. It blocks the flash and leaves a dark spot on your pictures and the flower hood has to be perfectly aligned or it will partly obscure the image. It also blocks the night vision and hologram feature, but to take it off to use either of these or the flash is a pain.Pro..protects lense (if you buy a seperate clear lense filter, but will cause focusing issues) and somewhat protects from the sun.Cons..Obscures the flash, infrared, and hologram. Pain to take off and put back on. Flower hood partially obscures image if not exactly aligned.Save your money."
1,waste of money,"Well this is going to be hard to write, for Jimi is one of the best everIf you want to see a show with 90% of the camera in Jimi's face, and face only, then buy this.Want to see him playing the guitar? for even half a song? not on this one. Got CD?someone start a school for these guys, worst camera work bar none I have ever seen. I dont care if there is only ""so much Jimi""A good example of concert producing and camera work is the Led Zeppelin DVD set released in 03 and pick and Austin City Limits concerts on PBS. why is this so complicated to learn? one would think a monkey could do this right.Listened with Sennheiser 595's, the best that I have found, had 555 for a couple years they are nice too, but cant touch 595's, pay the dif and see, er I mean hear.buy the Gypsies Live CD."
2,A Skipper,"It paused and skipped through the whole DVD, except for the interviews with other people, at the beginning. I was really disappointed with the quality of the DVD. This includes both DVD's."
5,"Hendrix, master of the Stratocaster","While many have seen snippets of the Woodstock film, this video goes above and beyond being simply a ""concert film"". It features a well designed and played out story of Hendrix's appearance at Woodstock with the crowning moment of the technicolor footage of the Woodstock performance. It definitely gives you a good feel of what it was like to have ""been there"".This video along with Jimi Plays Berkeley are among my favorites. Highly recommended if you're a Hendrix fan."
5,Angel came down from heaven yesterday...,"Primo show that is finally documented. The Black & White film captures Jimi best. Jimi got his musical talent mostly from his mother. Jimi's mom is buried in a pauper's grave near Jimi with a 3 inch by 8 inch slab of concrete labeled MITCHELL marking the site. Paul Allen should donate a real grave marker for the mother of guitar invention. The death of Jimi's mother changed his world, just as Jimi changed ours. Thanks Lucille, your short stay was just long enough to rescue me."
1,"Great Music, Bad Film","I believe there were four cameras at Woodstock recording Jimi's performance. The best camera position was just in front of him, at stage level. If the ""editors"" of this film had used mostly that camera angle, this would be an outstanding film of a great performance. Instead, it's the most amateurish and useless editing I've ever seen. We get prolonged close-ups of Jimi's nostrils, the back of his head, his finger tips, and people sitting in the audience looking mostly miserable and bored. It's a tragedy, so irritating that I can't even watch it anymore (and I'm Jimi's biggest fan)."
4,Audio is not as good as the 1999 Edition!,"While I share all the other reviewers thumbs-up on this re-issue, I did notice that the stereo audio track was somewhat different from the 1999 truncated (i.e. edited down to 50 minutes) DVD version. I did some A-B testing with 2 DVD players and lo and behold this is what I found: While both versions of the stereo audio track were mixed by Eddie Kramer, the 1999 Dolby Stereo soundtrack is mastered at 448 kbps, while the 2005 is at 198 kbps. The result is that the 1999 version has less compression and more dynamic range and headroom. It does make a big difference when you play them side by side! I guess they had to do this in the 2005 version to accomodate the longer playing time and the 5.1 soundtracks, which the 1999 version did not have. I guess I'll have to keep both versions."
5,Quilting for Dummies,Excellent in-depth book for the novice as well as the experienced quilter. It answers any question you may have. Highly recommended.
1,Not worth it,I have found that this book is less helpful than just going online and doing a 'free' tutorial or reading free beginners blogs. There are so many great resources and blogs available online that this book is not needed at all. Don't waste your money on this book and spend your money on patterns instead.
4,"Delightful, but also disappointing","As a complete novice at quilting, I looked forward to receiving this book. It is both a delight to read, and it's delightful to work the beginner projects included. However, it is also a disappointment. The author included several projects on wall hangings, but doesn't recommend to the reader/quilter, how, once the project is completed, to make a sleeve, or something similar, for hanging the completed piece. There are no instructions on hanging the quilted piece on the wall. I found it necessary to buy yet another quilting book to get these instructions."
4,quilt,"It wasn't as helpful as I had hoped it would be for me. But over all, the book itself was fine"
2,Not so much,This may be a good book as a hard copy nut as a ebook not so much. Was looking for step by step not the history of each step of quilting. Dissatisfied actually. Sorry
5,Quilting for Dummies,"The book was very informative, entertaining, well written with lots of great tips. As a beginner quilter I found it very easy to follow and enjoyed the book immensely. After reading it and marking pertinent notes I was able to complete my first quilt without a hitch! I highly recommend this book."
3,Informative,Great information was in the book for a beginning quilter. I received the book via kindle and have had no trouble reviewing the text.
5,New to Quilting,This is a great book with lots of information to help a beginner quilter or one who just want to learn something new about quilting. TERRIFIC resource for my sewing library.
5,Quilting Book,This is the very best book for a beginner as well as an experienced quilter. I wouldn't do without it and I do recommend it to every one that I know is wanting a quilting book.
4,Turrentine-McCann a winner combo,"It's a delight once again to listen to the remasterededition of ""That's Where It's At"" by these two superb jazzartists linked together. The quality of the reproduction isexcellent and the performance of Stanley Turrentine and LesMcCann is truly fine."
4,Good book to learn FH10 but not great,"This book does present many step by step examples with which you will learn how to use this program. I am using the book right now and am pleased with my progress. I am also pleased with how easy it is to draw using Freehand's tools to make vector graphics.However, the book does have a slight tendency to word a step confusingly from time to time. I have even found that occasionally, I will have to figure out my own way to do something b/c the text wasn't specific enough. But this is rare."
3,Lots of errors,"It's really a good book, but the amount of errors and typos is not accceptable. Oftentimes, you have to guess and try for yourself until you find the right methods. For a book aimed at the true beginners that is unforgivable. However, the annoying errors aside, it has good training examples."
4,Worth the watch,"A friend got me hooked on Downton Abbey. It is about an English estate & the family who are the custodians of the it. The viewer follows the lives of the family members of the estate, as well as, the lives the staff who serve them. There are characters to love and those who are rather charm free trouble makers."
4,Melodrama at its most sumptuous,"What else can one say about a story full of foreshadowed twists and turns, in a setting that looks like the Houses of Parliament?The excessive scrupulosity of the residents of Downton is just so much fun to watch."
5,wonderful! This series is the best,"100% great, the acting, the story, the clothes..it is so exciting while you are watching that you just can't get enoughyou want more."
5,most enjoyable ...well acted.,"I loved the acting, the setting, the production as a whole , the costumes, the characterization of each and every person in the play and their interaction with each other. Masterpiece Theatre is the best and I love to watch every play of theirs."
5,"~Hooked, along with the rest of the country!~","By now, everyone knows how season 3 turned out! I have watched movies all my life, which is a VERY long time..and it is the first time I found myself sitting with my jaw hanging open. Stunned!If we wanted reality, we certainly got it! Who ever thought the very rich and affluent had things lovely because of money, certainly had reality smack them in the face in the Masterpiece Classic. I own all of it...and am already watching it again. You can never get it all the first time through. THOSE are the kinds of movies I buy. Ones that I never tire of. Like a good novel...this drama keeps your interest...and for it probably always will. Like Gone With the Wind...or Out of Africa. Marvelous!"
5,Fabulous Series.,As an Anglophile this series is to me outstanding. It truly is time well spent. Well scripted and acted. Truly 5 Star.
5,Critique of Downton Abbey Season 3,"I absolutely love the story lines and alot of great acting. I love stories set in this time era. I only hope there is going to be a series four, and if so, it will be hard to wait another year."
4,Great Casting,The casting on this series is what makes it so successful. It will be interesting to see ho the plot morphs through the timeline.
2,Dissapointed,"Love the show, no qualms there. This is a fantastic series. I usually watch the episodes on PBS for free and when I couldn't wait for episode six to come online, I decided to purchase it from Amazon. imagine my disappointment when I purchased episode 5 instead (labeled as 6) and had just finished watching it last night for free. As far as I can tell, you can't ""return"" an episode, can you? They really should try to get the numbering straight!"
5,I love it!,I missed this episode due to the Super Bowl and it was well worth $1.99 to view it the following day!
5,BEST SHOW EVER,All of my friends and Family love Downton Abby! Each Episode is 45 min long and each season gets better and better!
5,I love this show!!!,I had never seen Downton Abbey before. This last Christmas my granddaughter told me all about it. I had to purchase and watch all episodes on my Kindle Fire. Love this series. Could watch it again and again.
5,Fantastic Costume Drama!,"This is one of the best British costume dramas ever! The acting is great and the story twists and turns quickly. The costumes of the era are almost as fabulous as the story itself. It is partially filmed at the actual Highclere Castle, which can be visited if you find yourself near London."
5,Great,Very entertaining. I enjoy the fact there is basically no foul language. Can watch this show with children in the room.
5,Downton Abbey,Downton Abbey is the best series on TV. Finally...something worth watching that keeps your attention. This is so worth it!
5,Great,"This entire series is fantastic. Well written, great characters...keep the episodes coming! One of many reasons to support your local PBS station!!"
5,Downton abby season 3,it is a great story. the acting is wonderful. I think anyone over the age of 12 would enjoy it
2,"ordered HD, got SD","I have Hulu attached to my tv with a hdmi cord so I ordered the episode I missed in HD, but all I could get was SD quality. Wasted a dollar, it seems. It's been so long since I've seen anything in SD--we're so spoiled!"
3,Are they serious?,"The only thing about this series I don't like is losing some key actors/actresses (I don't to spoil the series for anyone who's no up to date.) I would have chosen to re-cast instead of killing them off. I'm sure many wouldn't agree, but I'm sure just as many would! Soaps do it all the time! Anyway, I can't see giving the actors/actresses so much control over the story line. How many more are they going to have to kill off when they decide to leave??One more unreplaced character by death and I'm done with this series."
4,One of Masterpiece Classic's Best,"Really enjoyed this period piece -- a real glimpse into the lives of the British landed gentry. Bought the first two episodes from Amazon, watching the rest of Season 3 on PBS. Note: The original broadcast's Episode 1 is a two-hour segment; Amazon sells this as Episode 1 and 2. So Amazon's Episode 3 is the same as broadcast Episode 2, and so on."
3,"Great show, but not complete on DVD!!","I love this show like everyone else which is why I couldn't wait to get Season 3 on DVD. However, I only gave it 3 stars because I just discovered that there are scenes that are cut!! I was looking for a particular scene and it wasn't there. I checked what is airing On Demand and I was right. They are cutting scenes on the DVDs!! I will not buy any more until they produce an uncut version. Very disappointed as I thought I would be getting more than what is showing on TV, not less!!"
5,Downton Abbey - I'm a FAN !,Love the show! I am a huge fan of the series. And I appreciate how easy it was to order the episode!
4,season 3 episode 1,"great episode. Was a lot of fun, laughed a lot. Howe ver, image quality not great. Image is blurry at times. But good for price. Recommend watching in HD."
5,Great series,I pre-ordered season 3 and was very pleased with this purchase since I just couldn't wait to see on TV. I love English programs and this is my favorite.
5,Great!!,"This is a wonderful series and my whole family watches and loves it. Also, for me, it has closed captioning which I need. Would recommend it to everyone."
2,I'm Disappointed,"I just got through watching the end of Season 3, and I'm very disappointed. I understand however, that Dan Stevens (Matthew) had chosen to leave the series, leading the writers to have to find a way to write him out of the script. I just found the end heart breaking, perhaps because of how touching the scene with his wife and new child was. I really considered Matthew to be the hero, and without him, I'm uncertain of the series continuation. I'm donating my dvd's to my local library."
3,You can't have a baby on this show,The season finale was over the top. Will something bad happen each time a baby is born??? That was my last show regardless of how many seasons there are.
1,Not As Advertised,"This Downton Abbey season 3 was advertised as the unedited UK Verson, but some of the scenes aired on PBS have been deleted and others have been added. Will AMAZON refund the purchase price of this video or provied a store credit in the amount of the purchase price??"
5,"love, love, love",I'm hoping for 30 seasons. please keep the writing strong. I love this show and would hate for it to get cheesy.
2,DOES NOT INCLUDE FINAL EPISODE!!,Very annoyed to find that the final episode was not included in this package! And I waited WEEKS to get the first 2 seasons and they were incomplete as well! Just tell me for pity's sake! I would have bought more tapes. How hard is it to provide complete information?
5,"downton abbey is an awesome show, i cant wait for sunday nights to watch it","Love this show, love the characters, I had never heard of this show before I went to my daughter and son house and she got me hooked now I must admit I am addicted to this show."
3,Getting somewhat fed up with this now...,Too much overwritten sloppy sentiment is ruining this once fine drama. The plot lines are becoming repetitive and I yearn for more than romance and vindictive servants trying to get the better of each other. Only Lady Edith's life is at all interesting. The introduction of 18 year old Rose provided some welcome relief. Perhaps they can take her character to some more jazz clubs to give a bit more fun and color.
5,Fantastic British TV,"This is one of the best shows ever produced. I have all of them on Amazon streaming video. Stopped buyong DVDs ages ago, running out of room to store them. My entire collection is either British sitcoms, British mysteries, (Midsomer Murders is incredible !) or British drama and detective series, (Inspector Morse can't be compared). The Brits know how to produce quality, unlike American dreck."
1,Is it Widescreen? Is it conpatable with USA dvd players?,"A number of reviews of British productions seem to indicate that certain dvds purchased will not play in US dvd players, with no mention of that in the product description. Also, the same situation occurs when the product has been comverted to widescreen. The advertisements for the products need to address these two issues."
5,A great show,You will not be sorry purchasing this season of Downton Abby. Shirly Maclain guest stars and is so funny as the American. This show was SHOCKING this year. I believe you will love it.
5,Fascinating period piece,"Wonderful writing,perfect cast,great step back in time in an extraordinary setting. Would recommend strongly for genre and period authenticity of historical fiction."
5,Not predicatable!,"The first two seasons were delightful but somewhat predictable - the characters were engaging but rather one-dimensional. Season 3 has some shockers that are making the show more exciting, though not all of the shocks are welcome ones! Regardless, this season has caught my attention more and will keep me on the edge of my seat much more than the previous ones, while continuing to provide the fascinating peek inside a lifestyle that is totally foreign to 99.9% of the world."
4,Downton Abby seasoned 3,This is a five star show for sure. It gets four for now as the streaming for seasone 3 is not in HD.
4,Downton Abbey Season 3,I missed the first 2 shows of this season and had to catch up. This show takes you by surprise when you first start watching
4,Tepid but has potential....,"The first few episodes have been a bit ""tepid"" but based on the excellent 1st and 2nd seasons and the great potential set up by those seasons and the great characters, I, with hope, grant it 4 stars. The reality has yet to be determined!"
5,Gotta watch.,This was the first time I have used the Prime. It was a free trial and now I am a lifer. This show is amazing. Watched both seasons back to back. Love...love....love it.
5,Breathless,Each episode leaves me breathless. I don't recall ever being this emotionally involved in a series.These are characters you can really care about.
1,Can't view purchased episodes as promised,"It is January 29th,2013 and I have paid for a season pass. The last few episodes show up as unavailable for that season but all episodes were released today. Disappointing! My show is hijacked."
1,Jumped the shark in Season 3 due to schlepie bo beppie writers,"Spoiler alert - I naively wrote a friend of mine in England about how enjoyable I thought the video was. He wrote back to ask me how i could stand this tripe and then began to point out all the upcoming ruination of the Family.I should have known it was going off with the every episode a cliff hanger in season 2.Now we have an avid thinking feminist, Sybil, not only marrying a Roman Catholic, she becomes one in a church where mysogyny is the default protocol. In Season 2, we'd seen the father who manages neither his farm nor his money pushing himself on a maid, here he loses all both money and reputation. Then you thought it was bad enough for William to die but NOOO they have to kill off Matthew. The list is endless. Too bad they fired the good writers and went with the hacks."
4,Good series,I liked this series. It is interesting to see the portrayal of the demise of the manor house way of life.
2,Love the episode - problems with streaming,"Over half way through, the episode paused and the loading icon rolled continuously. Then I was given a message to come back later which I did twice (the next day). I watched a few more minutes until the scenario repeated. I went to pbs.org to complete my viewing and will go there to watch future episodes. I contacted customer service and none of their suggestions made any difference. This is the only time I have had a problem with amazon viewing. I'm a loyal amazon customer, but this was a disappointment."
2,"You should retitle your digital series ""EDITED original UK series""",I love Downton Abbey but Amazon sold me a faulty bill of goods. I bought the online series /Amazon Instant Video and find that I have missing/deleted scenes. How do I know that....my friends had me watch the DVD/BluRay/ PBS series and there they are. I notice that on Amazon some of those episodes are only 48 minutes long and on the DVD's they are not that short a time frame. When you delete scenes then we are truly not getting complete episodes on;Original UK version. So disappointing.
5,great series,I couldn't wait for this season 3 to come out . I just love this show. It is wonderul and I watch several episodes at a time.
2,Script seems to have ignored last season,"a little disappointing--mary's character lost its depth. She is back to the superficial aggressive money grabbing girl we thought she had shed during the war. script has difficulties too --Shirley Mac is too crass, overdone. Lord Grantham also comes off as a doddering fool."
5,Downton Abbey another excellent season.,"This season was another great BBC production. I watched all of the remaining episodes yesterday. Thankfully Bates was FINALLY released from prison!! Mathew's death was a shock! It would have been nice if he had the opportunity to be around for at least one more season. One death per season of a prominent character is enough, in my opinion."
4,Good show,"I want more:) I love reading and watching movies like this. I gave it 4 stars because im not thrilled with the whole Bates situation. Its so unfair to him and anna, however I understand that Amazon has nothing to do with the writeing."
2,"2 stars to amazon, not Downton Abbey","Love Downton Abbey... 5 starsnot being able to watch episodes prior to, or at least the same day they will broadcast on PBS... 2 stars!!"
5,<3 this show,"Downton Abbey does a great job of following many characters and story lines. It's like a soap opera without all the awkward long pauses and drawn out scenes. I've found myself emotionally invested in the characters, crying when something bad happens, feeling excited when good things happen. All 3 seasons have been fantastic!"
5,"Great Show, best acting I've seen in a long time.",Season 3 has turned out to be a great season. I am thoroughly impressed with the show. Highly recommended for all ages.
5,Season 3 Rocks,Cound not wait to watch iot weekly on PBS so bought Season 3 and happily watched my favorite characters deal with day to day life at Downton. Seller delivered as promised without incident...great to work with.
2,Server capacity,The program downtown abbey is excellent. You must improve and expand your capacity. It is hard between eight and eleven to get connected and the quality and speed once one is connected is slow. You can and should fix this.
5,Ying and Yang...,"I am heart broken as I write this review; first because of the last scene in season 3 and second, because it is over for now....what a wonderful story. So full of true life, the loss and heartache, the ecstatic joy of life. Downton is full of lessons and shows how we all are touched by the good and bad, no matter if we are rich or poor. Bravo! Artfully and tastefully done."
5,The Best Show!,One of my favorite shows. I just started watching Downton Abbey about 3 weeks ago and was addicted right away.
5,EXCELLENT!!!!!,"You will not be dissappointed. You will LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, it. I can't wait until season 4. Once you have finished you will want more."
1,crabby abbey,"There are some fine moments -- Thomas and James sorting it out near the end for instance; the beauty of the Scottish landscape, etc. but the writer finds no way to develop the relationship between Matthew and Mary other than to have them off each other or sentimentally enrapt with little in the way of nuances. This lack of development reflects a lack of imagination or interest in complex human interaction. Since the first two seasons were primarily driven by the chemistry between these two characters and the possibilities of bringing them together, this two dimensional and clumsy handling of their marriage has the effect of letting all the air out of the balloon. Instead, we get a shifting of focus from one relationship or situation to another to keep us interested. It works for a time but sooner or later the audience wants to be fed and most of what transpires is not satisfying. Killing off characters is dramatic as death has a way of stealing a scene or two, but good drama it is not."
3,I loved every episode... but the last ruined it.,"The last episode is supremely depressing. They have had success incorporating tragedy into the show, I suppose that encouraged them to push it further. But with each successive tragedy becoming greater than the last, they over-reached in the end.I do not see myself watching the next season, if there even is one. In my mind the show has no further value to me. They had some great writing in this show, but they ended on such a sour note, it spoils the whole experience."
5,Surperb Acting,Downton Abbey is as addictive as chocolate and just as enjoyable. Buy it! And then be prepared to agonize until the 4th season is released.
3,Disappointing season,"Not only was the loss of two main characters devastating, but the pace of the show was off. I will be very hard for the series to redeem itself."
5,Downton Abby,"The context of the story- the upstairs story/downstairs story was genius! Without it, this would just be another mildly appealing saga, but one I probably would have stopped watching long ago. And it just keeps getting better!"
5,Addicted,"I love period dramas anyways, and this is a great pick. Liked it so much mom got Seasons 1 &2 for Christmas as a change from the old westerns my dad loves."
4,Downton Abbey 3,"A beautifully produced and ""filmed"" series. Wonderful attention to detail re period settings. British humor and class that, from history read and family members own experiences, depicts with grace the differences and the likes of ""the classes"" in WW1 era Great Britain."
5,Sure thing,One can't go wrong with the Crawley's! Julian Fellows has created a set of charecters worth caring about and in this day and time that is saying something. I can't remember enjoying a show this much in years. If I had the option of six stars I would has taken it!
4,Streamed version of first four episodes of season 3 of Downton Abbey,"I love Downton Abbey! The streamed videos were of excellent quality with the exception of the fourth in the series. It stopped unexpectedly numerous times which made watching it very disconcerting. That is why I could not give a 5 star rating. The rating reflects the quality of the streaming, not the program itself."
3,Hart broken,"I am in love with Downton Abbey I think like anybody else that have seen this show. I just received Season 3 and cannot wait to see it, so I spent two days just watching the series. I am only giving 3 stars to this item simply because I am devastated with Mattew dead at the end and no returning to the show. I think it is unfair for us the fans that he is not returning. I know this show will not be the same for me from now on. Actors should think a little more of their fans and how much it will affect them before making the decision of not returning to the show just because they want to do something else. We get used to them and see them as an important part of the show and then they leave. Why not wait until the series are completely done! Sorry for been so negative but I am very disapointed."
5,I love British movies.,I have viewed all of the Downton Abby seasons. They are enjoyable to watch. But I was offended by the two men kissing. We know gays are a part of our lives but why throw these acts into our faces? Quality content is desired by the viewing public. I will continue to view Downtown Abby.
5,Love Downton!,"So far, Season 3 has not disappointed me. The streaming quality of this video via Amazon was excellent as well."
5,Still a DA fan.,"Although some of the scenes in Season 3's episodes were a little dull, on the whole I continue to be a fan of DA. Those scenes that were a little dull in the script were offset by the acting, costumes, and scenery, which has always been excellent. I continue to highly recommend DA and look forward to Season 4. My only comment to the powers that be, make it possible for the US fans to see the broadcasts sooner than later."
3,Love the series,We love the series but the streaming thru Amazon leaves a lot to be desired. The show stalls and resets frequently. This is very annoying.
5,Unable to watch it when airs locally,Love to continue along the story. My schedule made it hard to catch the airings on our local station and I had to keep fending of people in the office from wanting to discuss. I finally gave in an bought them. I figure it's less than the price of a movie.
1,Bye Bye Downton,"Just finished watching season three and sadly, that was my last season. If killing off two of the most beloved characters was deemed necessary, then this series is done. Happily, we'll always have seasons one and two."
5,Sadness,"I agree with a previous review about the first episodes of season 3. It felt repetitive. However, the last 4 episodes more than made up for the lag enough to say I thoroughly enjoyed the entire series. It cannot be true that it is over. The last scene cannot be how it wraps up. Up until that moment, the season finale had a an air of closure to it, feeling neat and tidy. But surely not. Otherwise a well done series I will miss.Added later: There will be a Season 4. Sorry for repeating unverified gossip. [...]"
5,Still Saucy,I'm always cautious with new seasons but this one is starting out very strongly. I'd say it's better than the last two seasons already.
5,Great! Can't wait to see more episodes,Great! Can't wait to see more episodes. Instant video ordering and download process is easy and fast. Can watch anytime.
5,Downton Abbey deserves its popularity,It's been a while since I found a show with such engaging characters and well constructed plot lines. I understand why my friends encouraged me to watch it and I would do the same for others.
5,Another great season,Good quality. Arrive on time and intact. Played perfectly. Won't spoil the Christmas special but boy were we upset! Looking forward to season 4.
1,Does not work on my computer,I have downloaded the show and it is not able to play. Maybe my connection speed is too slow. Now i have paid and can't figure out how to let Amazon know. HELP!!!
1,Episode 1,Episode 1: non- hi def. froze between 20-25 times during play. Watched next three episodes in in hi def with no problems.
1,Tedious download experience. Blurry so-called HD video despite very high speed internet. Still a great show.,Amazon needs to learn from iTunes video. Very sloppy execution of the process. Took about four tries before it connected.Disappointing video quality.Still a great show.
1,Haven't received yet!,"If it follows the many twists and turns of the first two seasons, how can it miss? I am anticipating its arrival."
5,Such a short snipet but liked it,It was a very short snipet but if the season is like the last too am sure i will love it. It is hard to judge something that short.
5,Wonderful,I love historical books and movies. It's one is great. Costumes and characters were wonderful and I found the storyline fun and engaging.
4,know little more about British history,This program gives me some idea of British history before and after World War I. I can see the struggle of the conservative and the liberal reform among the upper class and the lower class.
5,This is a great show.,We had heard a lot about this show but season 1 seemed slow. Each season is better and better. Season 3 the best so far. I guess it's because we know everyone better and can't wait to see what happens next!
5,The adventure continues...,The evolution of British aristocracy at the turn of the century. Tragedy and sentiment mixed with humor depicting the societal changes of British society.
2,Audo out of sync,Audio was out of sync. Was not worth $1.99. Would not recommend it. I hope future video purchases are better.
5,We are HOOKED!,"This is on order right now. We have seen seasons 1 and 2. At first my husband was not interested in an English series. I suggested he watch two episodes and decide. We are HOOKED. It is so much fun to see the interaction between the aristocracy and their servants and their interesting lives. Maggie Smith is so funny and so talented. I saw her in the Quartet, a recent release, such a great actress. We are anxiously awaiting delivery of season 3 of Downton Abbey and delighted to hear a four season is in the offing."
5,Can't wait!,"Can't wait for season 3 to start!I love Downton Abbey. They chose the perfect characters to play the parts, and the setting is just breathtaking."
5,Season 3 looks good!,"It's just a preview, but it's put together really well and teases enough to keep the interest...worth a watch! Can't wait for the new season!"
2,So far a disappointing third season,"Is it my imagination or does Season 3 appear to be stuck in the mud? I'm rather appalled that Mary's whole focus is getting Matthew's money just to invest in a lifestyle that is outdated and archaic... Maggie Smith still delivers the best lines with panache. Shirley McLaine was a huge waste of time despite the glowing reviews. And goodness, Edith once again gets the short end of the stick! Perhaps Dan Stephens saw the writing on the wall and jumped ship at the end of this eason..."
2,Not up to snuff,"I thoroughly enjoyed the first two seasons, but the 3rd has been a disappointment!! While 3rd season is nice, it's not the same level of writing or plot development and terminating the second character (no spoils here) is ridiculous, given all the other circumstances. Good luck to the show, but I'll skip any future seasons and hope to catch Maggie Smith in something else."
5,Downton Abbey season 3,Awesome show. Five star. Love it. Highly recommend Downton Abbey.Need to watch season one and season two. You will be hooked.
1,Not as expected!,"I will be sending my DVD collection for Season 3 back to Amazon, and hoping for a refund!I had watched seasons 1 and 2 on DVD and had read that the ""full UK version"" was more complete than what was aired on PBS. I began watching season 3 on PBS, but ordered the DVD set to be delivered upon release, anxious to watch the episodes in their entirety. Well, not only is it not the ""full UK edition"", it's not even the full US edition! I compared one episode that I had recoreded from PBS to the episode on DVD, and found there to be more than 10 minutes of footage missing on the DVD!I don't know what the ""game"" is. But I want my money back!"
3,good,"I love the Downton Abbey series, however this set of dvds has some scenes cut from the PBS Masterpiece series. I was disappointed to see that I did not have the complete season 3 as shown on PBS."
5,Doesn't fail expectations,This show always draws me in with it's imagery and well written story line. I am so glad it made it back for a third season.
5,Still more Downton Abbey,The family can't get enough of Downton Abbey. We've even invested in DVDs of the old Upstairs Downstairs PBS series.
4,Love Downton Abbey,"Though I love Downton Abbey, I have to say that I only gave this four stars because, at times, the quality of the video was somewhat pixelated. I don't usually have that problem viewing video on the device I watched it on, so I know it was not my device. Had this not been an issue for me, I would have gladly given it 5 stars."
5,Wanting more...,"Just keeps getting better...the only down side to ""Downton Abbey"" is that there are very few episodes for each season (series), but it does create anticipation."
5,Downton Abbey is great. Love it. Anxious for the next one.,"The acting, the wonderful wardrobe, the backgrounds in the house, and in the field and surroundings are awesome. Very well done."
3,manipulative,"The writers are becoming pretty predictable, but the acting is truly stellar. Some of the scenarios are starting to repeat themselves. I hope they bring in some new writers for next season. Violet's one-liners make the show worth watching."
5,"Greate show, well worth the money spent.","unlike most tv shows that received high praise and accolades, Downton Abbey is a breath of fresh air. I didn't watch the first 2 years of the show because I was skeptical of those who gave it such over the top reviews. However, after several friends started touting the quality of the show and its performers, I relented and bought all three seasons. I have to admit, I found it hard to stop watching it until I had seen the last and final episode for season 3. Now I can hardly wait for season 4 to be available so that I may continue viewing this quality BBC offing from our distant cousins across the pond. :-), If you are looking for quality programing to distract you from the cares and woes of our current economic crisis and political climate, I highly recommend this program. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have."
3,Good content but weak indexing,The material plus imaging is five stars. But trying to find your place or another scene is an incredibly awkward journey. One of the worst systems I have encountered.
5,One of the best series ever,"I am so hooked on this show I can hardly wait for the next episode. I love the storyline, the characters and the history."
5,Wow! This Episode was a true Tear Jerker Supurb!,"Episode 5 A New Edition was the absolute best, enthralling, spellbinding on the edge of your seat episode. WoW! Why why did youtake one of our favorite characters? However, it's what keeps this series REAL!Lady Robinson"
5,LOVE IT!,LOVE this series! I watched all 3 seasons in a matter of days after work and after my son was in bed. Disappointed with the ending but still looking forward to season 4!
4,"Love it, Recommend it, Worried about Season 4",Downton Abbey is a wonderful show. If you are a first timer to the show you should start from Season 1. This season has a lot of things happen but the end of the 3rd season is very dissapointing. I haven't decided if I will watch Season 4.
1,"Don't waste your money, download better quality from PBS website","This download would never load correctly; played for a minute, then choppy. Then couldn't get video to load at all. Didn't want to spend more on HD version, but figured out that all these episodes are on [...] for free"
4,High class soap opera,"This DVD reminds me somewhat of ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" - a more modern version, but equally classy and envolving. Very good.MH"
5,Downton Abbey Season 3 is terriffic!,I just love it! I have wateched seasons one and two and waited for season 3 all summer and fall. My only compaint is that Shirley McClaine was given such a small role. Would have loved to have seen more of her. Can't wait to download the next installment. It was my one extra motivation to purchas Amazon Prime.
5,Downton Abbey,Absolutely wonderful series...It catches your attention and then it keeps you there. Certainly worth the money and most important your time. Enjoy!!
3,video stuttered,video stopped while audio went on then video would 'fast forward' and catch up. this was very disconcerting while trying to watch.
5,10 Stars from me!,"Love, love, love this series! Watched all three seasons within a few weeks and can not wait for season four!"
4,Bad ending,I loved everything except the end of the season. Maggie Smith is the best! Poor Lord Grantham - he never seems to get his way. Hooray for Edith trying to make something worthwhile of her life.
5,British Granduer 1800's,It gave a very good account of how the old large estates functioned. All of the characters had different lives and dreams and their stories were interesting and told well
