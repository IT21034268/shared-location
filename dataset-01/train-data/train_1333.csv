4,Getting a handle on Green Chemistry,"I haven't read the entire book, though it is small. I recently heard the authors speak and was happy to have some framework put to the topic and some parameters drawn that offer some guidelines for understanding. Previously the term ""green chemistry"" was as fuzzy as the electron cloud."
4,Too thin!,"I love this product! I like the length, the size, even the color, but I wish it were of a thicker material. I feel it is too thin."
5,Spa Wrap,"I bought two of them for my wife as xmas present and she was very happy with them, I do not know if they said whatsize they were but I lucked out my wife is 5'10 and they fit perfect."
1,KKdiver,"not a product review because I have never recieved the product. Ordered three weeks ago and it still hasnt shipped. I wanted it in time for a vacation, but I had to just put out a large container full of cat food. I am not happy"
2,Great Sparrow Catcher,We purchased the medium feeder for our dog when we planned a week-end trip. When we returned we found a sparrow in the reservoir even though it was about a third full. I thought it was a fluke until we caught a second sparrow with the reservoir being about half full the very next day. We had to dump the dog food because of the bird droppings.
1,"cheap junk - poor ""tech support""","This printer is a cheap hunk of junk. Arrived DOA. The so-called ""technical support"" (wasn't all that technical, and would rather interrupt me that support me) was useless in resolving the issues. The ""latest"" drivers are over two years old, and still broken.If you can get it to work, it might be OK, but my experience is that you'll get frustrated with the unit and the abysmal ""technical support"" first, and return it."
3,"not a great Shannon Tweed flick,but there are other treats","While the scenes with Shannon Tweed aren't that great,you do get to ser her [body] quite a few times(though alot of the scenes are in a slow motion style).There are other scenes without her however,that are pretty good.The main one I'm referring to is the one with Shannon Tweed's character's husband(I can't remember her name in the movie)and the big-breasted brunette having [adult contact] against the desk in his office,and then on his couch.At least rent this one to check it out,then draw your own conclusions."
1,An awful one,"Pre-surgery sex star Tweed shows all of her acting skills -and there are none. She looks frightened the whole time. Shorty Stevens does the same. The plot (if you could call it that way) drives you nauseous, to say it softly. Moreover, if you came here trying just to spot Shannon's body, you'd better skip this one. There are many others that fit that purpose much more appropriately."
3,What can you expect?,"This is simply Wheel of Fortune, right down to every aspect of the game show supporting SNES graphics. It is very easy to play esp. w/ the step-by-step instructions along the way. There are slight pauses between turns but what can you expect. One little strange feature was how the game enables you to stop the wheel almost on a dime and it's not like the wheel spins fast. If you hit it right when you see Bankrupt, it will stop immediately after within the next few slots. Not like you can't ever lose the game by doing so, but it's a nice ""edge"" :) Overall this game is basic and what you should expect the SNES version of the game should be."
4,Wheel of Fortune!,The game arrived early. It doesn't get old since there is a challenge to it. Being a fan of the show makes it better for me. Fun.
3,a small complaint,"Hi,I loved this book. This is the third copy I have purchased. I did however have a problem with this latest copy.I found that the slip cover had been badly creased during packing, which was disappointing as I had purchased it for a friend. In the end I had to substitute the cover, for the one off my own personal copy.Carol"
2,Tasha Tudor,"If we could all live in a fantasy world this book would probaly be more meaningful. Got this book as a garden/back to nature resource. Not for people who have to balance their families,work and of course money. Skip unless you are an absolute Tasha Tudor fan."
1,New recipe not so good,"The new recipe has the same flavor but the wonderfully thick creamy mint filling has been replaced by a slimy white mush-- and the chocolate is much thicker. Some might enjoy these changes but I found them unpalatable. Today, when weight gain is an issue for most people, why mess with the formula to create a fattier product? I will not be buying these again."
1,Costly Shipping,Too much to ship. I bought in combination with 2 other candies to get a free shipping deal from Amazon. All 3 shipped from different places and I paid seperate shipping for all. READ THE FINE PRINT!!!!!
3,"Nice taste, not so great texture....and keep serving minimal or get all gassy/poopy","I gave up sugar (mostly 99% of the time) a bit over a year ago. For a while, I just didn't really have treats. Saw these in the drugstore and got some. Ya know, they do taste like the YPP we know and love. Nice and minty and chocolatey. BUT....The texture is just not the nice one associated with the original. This lacks that creaminess and...well...the texture magic. These are dryer...er...it's hard to describe, but it's not a lovely textural experience.Hence the 3 stars.Also, I wouldn't recommend more than one, two max at a pop. The sweetener they use will make you visit the bathroom and gurgle you up in more than minimal quantities. Well, they do me, anyway.But, for sugar avoiders, one of these once in a while after a meal is rather nice. :DNow, if they could just use a less gas-making sweetener like, say, erythritol or sucralose."
3,The Chosen of the Sun,"This is the first book in the trilogy of the second age. It begins the adventures of Eliezer Wren and a boy named Yushuv and their struggle against evil forces. It is an easy read, compared to other books I've read, but lacks real depth. However, if you like fantasy or are a fan of White Wolf fantasy, you should definetly give it a read."
3,Live from Ukraine,"I am waiting with baited breath for my new Matt Taylor CD. I met Matt when we were both Peace Corps Volunteers in Ukraine years ago. I remember when he was putting songs together and trying them out during our annual group meetings. There were some great nights of him playing his fingers to the bone.It's great to see him grow from those humble beginnings (and believe me, Matt is truly, truly a humble guy). I always try to keep tabs on what he's doing. I hope to see his name in bigger lights someday.Will add more stars after more listening time."
5,Awesome Book!,"Great book, got it a few days ago and just as I thought it ispacked with cool effects. This book teaches you the good stuff right away and is easy to follow. I have already learned some new tricks and this book has been teaching me new ways of using photoshop."
2,Not For Beginner!,"I'm a newbie to photoshop and I found that this book is not for beginner at all. To use this book, you need to understand Photoshop elements first. If you are new to photoshop, I recommend you to check out "" Inside Photoshop 7""."
5,A 'Must Have' for Photoshoppers,Photoshop novices and veterans alike will benefit from this exciting collection of effects and design tips. Step by step instructions in easy to understand language with crisp color graphics. In the last 48 hrs I've created at least a dozen images containing effects I hadn't been able to achieve previously. My enthusiasm for Photoshop has reached a whole new level. I am positively thrilled with this purchase!
4,not new but interesting,"this book can't consider features of the newest version of photoshop but it's really interesting because you can use these ""tips and tricks"" for your works and see how the idea is developed."
2,Duped for Dollars :(,"It's useless, unfortunately. I can't see myself actually even using anything I learned from this book, ever. It's past the point of inconceivable. It focuses too much attention on a bunch of boring-not-going-anywhere layer styles, credits to Al Ward as far as I can pick up from the insinuating banter at the end of the book. And speaking of the end of the book, what's up with the last two projects? One has to do with a movie poster, ""The Pool"", which was awful. And another one of a tin-can advertising ""Goldfish in a Can"", which is the epitome of junk. But it's a great way to end the book though, all your accumulated knowledge from reading and practicing previous chapters and look where it got you. Hah! I didn't even bother sorting through that worthless dribble. I don't know who these other reviewers are that are giving kudos to this rubbish of wasted ink, because this is not the paragon for which all other Photoshop books aspire to be. This is crap."
2,Wartenberb Wheel,"This piece seemed to be sufficient but the nut fell off after two uses. There is a design flaw which makes it so you can only run it one way! Otherwise, it is sharp and perhaps I can fix it to work right with a small locking nut"
1,shoddily made,"I suppose you get what you pay for, but this thing looks like it was made by people with a grudge against their bosses, their customers, or both. The pins in the wheel are unevenly spaced and of uneven lengths. The axle is so loose the thing wobbles all over the place. I could make a better piece of equipment than this myself for about $4 in parts."
5,Putco Chrome Mirror Overlay,Purchased for 2007 Tacoma approximately 60 days installed.Pros:Installation was very quick and easy with each overlay having four double sided adhesive strips already attached. The adhesive strips are made by 3M and appear to be a higher quality adhesive. The product has held up for the last 60 days and have noticed any major degradation. I would recommend this product and i would buy it again.Cons:Nothing really. I noticed on my passenger side only on the mirror side of the overlay there is a small overlap that surronds the mirror. This edging has a couple white spots where it looks like the chrome has either chipped off or was never there. This though is not noticeable and it doesn't appear the chrome would peel off...
3,GM Thinking Insights,"This book is, in a way, Part II of Soltis's book on calculation. It's very practical and gives some insights on how GMs choose moves at the board using Kotov's method, process of elimination, and ""intuition"". A good book with some good examples, but nothing revolutionary here."
2,ZZZZZ.....,"Oh, yeah, what? Ok, I am supposed to write a review. Here is my verdict "" Childish, stupid plot, antiquated language: Result -> 3 tablets for an inevitable headache!!!"""
2,For Teen Pop Completists Only,"Most of the tracks on this compilation were unreleased. There's a reason. A few tracks amuse but most are run-of-the-mill early 60s fluff, with some particularly annoying ""novelties."" Truly for ""Popcorn"" completists only, and well below the musical standards of the usually-stellar Ace reissues."
1,Edgar Schuster is a forgotten eugenist,"I read this weak book, here in Brazil. This book has eleven chapers. After the eleven chapters, there's a bibliography and an index. The first chapter is an introduction. The chapter eight is about Tuberculosis, insanity, feeble minded and epilepsy. On this chapter eight, we can read: ""Indeed, while Charity is but moderately active Faith and Hope seem to have run mad.""Charles B. Davenport is remembered many times, in this book. In fact he is called Dr. Davenport in this weak book. Edgar Schuster, the author of this book , is now a forgotten eugenist. Even in his times, Edgar Schuster wasn't a famous eugenist. Sometimes is good to be forgotten."
5,Wonderfully relaxing music,"I purchased this CD in Montana last summer and have really enjoyed it. It's a wonderful way to create a peaceful atmostphere at work! I would also recommend it for yoga practice, stretching or mediatating."
4,Cute set,"I purchased this set a couple of weeks ago.I love it.The table is a little wobbley,could be my floor.So easy to put together...it came with it's own cute little wrench.My daughter and I put it together in 10 minutes or less.The tile on the table top is really nice.Glad I bought it."
1,Little useful information here,"If you have a rotator cuff tear, as I do, this video will not help you get better. It's about 20 minutes in length and seems to have been produced as a handout for surgeons to give to their prospective patients. Shoulder Pain by Cailliet and the 7-Minute Rotator Cuff Solution by Horrigan (both available on Amazon.com)are much more useful. They have detailed drawings of the shoulder, how it works, what can go wrong, and what you can do to make it better."
4,Awesome modern day thrash metal....,"It seems that with every album The Haunted keep getting better & better! 'Revolver' was awesome, but this album takes off from there but has a more mature sound to it which rounds it off nicely. Get this if you liked the last album for sure!"
5,peo;ple can't accept change,"This album is beautiful. I was expecting, by reading all the negative reviews, that it would disapoint. Quite the contrary. It is every bit as good as rEvolver, but has a more sinister and progressive element. Every song is addictive and gets better with each spin. Sure they could have put out another pure thrash album that was similar to there old stuff, but instead have truely evolved and are showing us what a great metal band should, diversity."
1,The dead eye is just that dead!!,"This, great band at one time had some good stuff first and second ones there best the rest is bad, But hey maybe this works for some people what ever"
4,listen with an open mind,"I'm a huge supporter of this band ever since i heard the heavy sick thrash off there 2nd album ""Made me do it"" this band has grown and grown and my god this album is DIFFERENT....at first listen i was kind of like eh? this is all the haunted had come up with? I loved rEVOLVEr but some of the influences on that album take a huge leap on this, they seem to add more grundge type singing and it works....Fans of the old haunted albums will be turned off i can tell you right now, but if you heard rEVOLVEr and liked what you heard check this out...Its really original and different for a thrashy album....It grew on me and wil be buying SOON!"
5,It works!,"I read the first book and it was wonderful! This book is just as great. My baby went from sleeping less than 5 hours a night to 11. Before reading this book, I was doing what used to work when my baby was 3 months but was no longer working now that my baby is 5 months. Adding solids was more complicated then I thought! Great book to use as a guide."
4,nice info book,"My cousin recommended this book set. said it was very helpful to her. it has a lot of common sense infomation in it. great for the husband that don't have a clue around babies. if you have been around babies, it is a great reminder book."
2,not detailed enough,"This book did not have enough specific information for me. I was looking for recipes, suggestions, and methods on starting my baby on solids. I liked Super Baby Food book much better."
3,Baby Wise II,"On Becoming Baby Wise: Book II (Parenting Your Pretoddler Five to Fifteen Months)I didn't find this as helpful as Baby Wise, however there was some good information about highchair manners and sign language which we've found helpful. I can't wait to read Toddler Wise!!!!"
1,Too bad there is not a zero star rating,"This book is nothing more than child abuse. It's sad that people who believe this stuff to be true even have children. Children are to be loved, nurtured and respected. This book teaches you how to do just the opposite.No wonder their publisher is pulling the plug on them. I wouldn't want to be associated with them either."
1,"Horrible, aweful book","All the books in this series are horrible. The worst parenting advice ever. Babies need to be loved & responded to, not put on some arbitrary schedule & ignored when their needs don't meet that schedule. Total insanity!!! For a real, down to earth, positive parenting book try The Baby Book by Dr Sears. Not everything in any book is going to make sense to you & jive with your parenting style, but the most important thing is to listen to your heart & not what society or anyone eles tell you you need to do. Do what works best for you & your family!"
1,thoughts are good...,"I didn't like that they kept referring to the first Babywise book. I got this when my daughter was 4 mos old and thought it would be a good read, but instead I found that it made me feel guilty that i hadn't read the babywise book when I was still pregnant and started their babywise sleep schedule when she was first born. This book left a bad taste in my mouth. I decided to toss the book and go at it my own. My daughter is now 7 mos old and she naturally is falling into a sleep routine. I think we as parents should start trusting our own instincts instead of reading all these books from so called 'experts'."
5,Sleeping through the night,We read the original Prep for Parenting book by Gary Ezzo and are thrilled with the results. Our son started sleeping through the night at seven months. We continued with the Parenting Your Pre Toddler book. We have followed the book about 90% and people come up to us all the time and comment on how well behaved our 2 year old son is in public. We are looking forward to the next book.
1,children are not robots,"If you have a child to make them conform to your needs, to distrust life, to fear making mistakes, then I guess this book might appeal to you. A child is every bit as much a human being who deserves respect, love, and trust as their parents. They are certainly not born sinners needing strict discipline to fit into society. A newborn needs, wants, and craves closeness, the ONLY form of communication he has is crying, to ignore his cries is to tell him that he is not important enough. He will learn to manipulate because he cannot get through any other way. How Ezzo can say he is Christian is beyond me. Christian means being Christ-like, and I have yet to see anything that would lead me to believe that Christ would have treated children with such loathing. Nowhere in the bible does it say ""thou shalt swat your child daily"" My rating is- get this book off the market. It is no wonder children are growing up with such hatred in them."
4,Use this as a guide,"As new parents, my husband and I looked for some guidance on healthy infant sleeping information. Three of our friends, with children of their own of course, recommended this book. I had previously been reading the Dr. Sears's books (which are basically the opposite of Ezzo's). Babywise was very helpful to us in the area of understanding infant wake and sleep cycles.By no means did we take this book word for word! Yes, sometimes you NEED to let your baby cry, but you also need to listen to your senses and your heart. You'll figure it out. Do what feels right. Babywise is helpful. Our daughter was sleeping through the night by three months."
1,This book treats children like property not human beings!,"In regards to the reviewer who said this book teaches children to ""Do unto others as you would have them do unto you"": Think about this statement.You want children to treat others as they would like to be treated.But, how, by spanking children, forcing their hands away while being fed, and other tactics teaching children to treat others with respect? It seems if you want to teach children to treat others kindly and with respect, shouldn't we not treat them the same way? How else will they learn respect and other good habits unless we teach them correctly? A child can't learn to respect others unless he himself is treated with respect! And, they can't respect themselves either.If you want a child who treats others with respect, then treat him with respect! THAT is how they learn."
1,A book on how to neglect,"This book has to be one of the most revolting parenting books written. He is not a medical doctor nor does have any special training in parenting. He states that his work is based on The Bible, but I do not see anywhere in the Good Book to allow your child to cry needlessly or deny feedings. There are several cases againt Ezzo and Babywise for unnessecary deaths due to dehydration. If you need a book on parenting, please do yourself and your child a favor and choose otherwise."
4,Best Book for New Parents Trying to Cope!,"Babywise was recommended by a family member that has a wonderful 4 year old that is happy and healthy. We decided to use it with our newborn and am happy to say that he is now over 2 years old and very happy and healthy and eager to learn at any opportunity. To those who are criticizing, you are NOT really reading the book. It is about common sense, not extremes. Do what is comfortable with any child but don't make this book out to be the problem...that is usually the fault of the parent!"
4,panning for gold,"You have to read the entire book cover to cover to glean the excellent information contained within. My son is thriving, delightful, happy, and yes--he sleeps through the night. The number one rule is USE YOUR JUDGMENT!! if you're making your kid miserable with the rules, well duh, it's bad parenting! That same parent is going to fail with the opposite method...! Might as well get some sleep while you're at it. This book is brilliant with advice, but needs to be read carefully. There are many contradictions contained within and it isn't very well organized--but once you sift out the confusions, the GOLD IS THERE."
4,Everything in Moderation,This is an excellent book if you remember not take it verbatim in every situation. All children are different and have different needs. The Ezzo's mean well but tend to get legalistic. This book is a good starting point for creating how your family chooses to raise a child.
3,Too much,"I love the 'On becoming babywise' book, it really worked with my six month old son. He's been sleeping throught the night since he was 6 weeks old. So naturally I bought the second book with high hopes and was really dissapointed. I feel like I'm only suppose to love my son if he's well behave (all the time!) or I'm setting him up to be a difficult person later on. The feeding and sleeping plans are still really good but don't take the discipine part too seriously. Come on, we're talking about little kids here."
4,Response to another review,"One of the reviews for this book refers to the the ""schedule"" feeding of babies up to 8 weeks old. This review must be referring to the original Babywise book by the Ezzos, not this one.Nonetheless, in response to their review, I would like to recommend that parents consider the value of looking at the Babywise series. We know many parents who have followed the feeding plan suggested by the Ezzos (by the way, they do not call for strict schedule feeding but, instead, for a feeding process that is flexible and family-centered). In fact, all the parents we know who have followed the Babywise principles have had their children sleeping 6-8 hours at night by the time their baby was 6 weeks old.I think all of the Ezzo books are fantastic for learning how to raise a child to be self-confident, secure, and others-centered rather than self-centered."
1,Dangerous and Harmful,"This book will seriously damage children emotionally.As a lactation consultant I also strongly disagree with the feeding advice which science has proven will jeopardize breastfeeding relationship. Many Ezzo babies get dehydrated and depressed.The Advice in this book goes against the American Academy of Pediatrics policy statement on breastfeeding. Ezzo has no MD qualifications, just weird and cruel ideas. Children learn about relationships from their parents and if the parents do not respond to the babies needs and cues it can damage the childs confidence in his own ability to love and communicate. All mammals need close contact with others. Even adults need to be held and loved...Babies are not computers we cannot program them. As a healthcare professional I condemn this book. Your baby is too important to experiment with these weird ideas in the name of convenience."
2,Not as good as the 1st book,"I swear by the 1st Baby Wise book on sleeping, which is why I purchased this book. I was a bit disappointed and have not found it very helpful. I'm all for table manners but I just don't think that a 6 month old is ready for that."
2,Very annoying,"I liked the concepts in the first Babywise book and recommend it to others (my baby has been sleeping through the night since she was 11 weeks old). On the other hand, THIS book has a few useful ideas, but I was bothered by the many grammatical/typographical errors in the edition I received (the one I bought is for ""your pretoddler five to twelve months""). These errors made this book lose a lot of its credibility for me. I don't know where the authors got their information about feeding solids; they recommend starting with yellow veggies and serving fruits as ""treats"". The medical community doesn't say this and it doesn't make sense to me. (I fed my baby fruits first and she still loves her green veggies!) There are other ideas that are introduced but not well described. This book is poorly written; it's as if the authors rushed through it just to get another book published."
2,Nothing like BabyWise Part 1...,"BabyWise part one was a life changer for me when my twins came along!! Part 2 however was a major disappointmet :/ I was hoping for the same type of ideas as part one, only for older babies, but it was more like an old school baby discipline book. For example it talks more about teaching babies how to BEHAVE at the table once they start eating vs. how often and how much they should be eating. From a HUGE advocate of part one, take my word for it... Part 2 wasn't even worth the .99 price tag."
1,These guys need to grow up!,"I am a mother of 3 boys and I know how demanding childrearing can be. This book is obviously written by men who feel displaced at home by the new infant. They have no statistics to back up their illogical presumptions. They casually suggest letting your baby cry it out for up to 45 minutes. This may be easy for a disattached father, but most parents, especially breastfeeding mothers would find this impossible."
1,The worst parenting advice one could seek!,"Based on the high recommendation of friends, I purchased this book. As I read it, I was stunned. What does slapping a 6 month old infant on the hand and isolating them accomplish? How does keeping them confined in a playpen stimulate creativity and independence? The results I've witnessed personally of my friends' children is that this method of parenting creates hostility, anger, emotional and behavioral problems and in some cases, hatred toward the parents. These children all under the age of three do not smile, laugh, or even hug their parents. There is an obvious detachment at an eary age. Yes, these children will behave properly, but at what expense to their well being? Do not waste your time reading this book."
1,This book is dangerous to your child's emotional health!!!!!,"This book puts mothers back in the sixties, when the disorder of autism was felt to be caused by ""refrigerator mothers"". It is now proven to a neurobiological disorder that is based in genetics. Ezzo slams the attachment style of parenting (Sears) by saying that the attachment style of parenting tells you to never ignore crying as it may create autismlike symptoms"". This is an absolute lie and not founded on any research of Dr. Sear's books. Dr. Sears never once stated that ignoring a child's cry will create autism symptoms. It must be known that a child is born with autism and someone like Gary Ezzo hardly has the intelligence to comment on a disorder so complex and one that we are working as hard as we can to keep the next generation from having to deal with. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK"
3,"Helpful, but repetitive","I found this book to be helpful in some aspects but noticed that there was a lot of summary repeats from the previous book. I am glad I purchased it, though. The information I was looking for was there. I just had to wade through the chapters to find it."
5,I love all baby wise books,These books have been my baby training bibles. I have read them over and over and they have been very helpful!
4,Not as good as the first one,I loved the first Babywise so I got this one because I thought it would have more helpful information about feeding schedules. I was disappointed with the content because it did not really have the detailed information I was looking for.
1,do not buy this book,"I purchased this book, read it from cover to cover, and cannot say that I found one piece of good information. Refering to examples of imaginary children? No medical training much less ANY college degree? Links to dehydration? Do Not Buy This Book! I would resell mine, but I'd rather be out the five bucks that it's NOT worth than give it to anyone else to read. Do your research! ezzo.info"
1,Zero Stars!,"Gary Ezzo's own church has distanced themselves from the Ezzos and this dangerous book, whose breastfeeding information is inaccurate at best and dangerous at worst. Ezzo himself has quite the God complex."
2,Not like the first book,"If I'd seen this in the store I would not have bought it. The first book is so helpful, but this one lacks on substance, and detail. I'd go for the first book and skip this one."
1,A disturbing underlying message...,"I received the Babywise series after the birth of my son. In addition to what others have written about the dangers of following the advice in this book, I found them to have a disturbing underlying message- that children are something to be tolerated and trained rather than loved and enjoyed. My conclusion is that Ezzo doesn't like children much. He doesn't respect their basic needs (like hunger) and labels what is considered by most to be developmentally appropriate behavior ""misbehavior"" that requires ""correction"". I just went away feeling like the book was written for people who want convenient babies, ones that don't interfere with their lives. Babies are hard work. There are no easy, definitive answers about how to raise them and Babywise is disingenuous to suggest otherwise."
1,A dangerous book,"I cannot believe anyone would recommend this book, it is dangerous and misinformative. These people are not pediatricians or psychologists and should not be offering advice on children or child rearing. They are right-wing religious fanatics who are trying to promote their beliefs in the guise of parenting tips. There has been much controversy about this book and for good reason, they do not understand child development and offer dangerous suggestions. A much better book would be any in the Positive Discipline series, by J. Nelsen, Ed.d."
5,Invaluable resource for our daughter!,A friend recommended the babywise book after having used it with her son. Our daughter was up every 30-45 minutes all night which as new parents we thought that was normal. Within two weeks of purchasing this book our dayghter was sleeping 10-12 hours without waking at all. I highly recommend this series!
1,Author is self-proclaimed Pastor. NO FORMAL TRAINING- BAD!,"This book has been declared dangerous by the American Academy of Pediactrics.FYI... The author is neither ordained or formally trained in theology or medical areas. He is entirely self proclaimed. His own church has severed all relations with him due to his ""ideas"" about child rearing.His ideas are NOT based in religion or medical data, but in convience. If you are not ready for a baby, get a goldfish instead.VERY DANGEROUSE FANATICAL BOOK! DO NOT BUY!"
5,Another great book,"I love the Baby Wise series. It truly reinforces the importance of rules, boundaries and structured learning. We have so much less trouble with our LO than many of our friends and I know that much of it has to do with the guidance of these books. This book helped us introduce solid foods correctly and structured playtime. Great read."
3,Contains helpful information but reader needs common sense!,"I loosely followed the ideas in Babywise and my baby slept through the night at 16 weeks (he was 3 weeks premature). The way to use this book is to use its ideas to try to establish a schedule for you baby and good eating/sleeping habits, but not to force anything on your baby. Above all, feed the baby when he is hungry. If you use the book combined with common sense, no baby is going to starve or fail to thrive."
5,Babywise Worked For Us,"I used the Babywise system with my daughter as soon as I got home from the hospital. She ate every three hours and slept through the night at seven weeks. She is now a happy, healthy one-year-old. She went an entire year without being sick. Her grandfather is her pediatrician and is very proud of how healthy and happy she is. I know that it is very popular right now in childcare to recommend that a new mother listen to her baby's cues so that she may know when her baby is hungry or tired, but what about the baby who prefers to sleep through a mealtime? PDF doesn't require that you starve a baby, if a baby fed on a two-and-a-half to three hour schedule is dehydrated, they must be checked out by a physician. I don't think the Ezzo's viewpoint is extreme at all. They simply present a sensible way to help a child adapt to a reasonable schedule quickly, and it worked very well for us."
1,Terrible present,"I was given this book as a gift by a supposedly very religious person. It was frightening to read the ideas in this book and know that this woman advocates them. Ezzo states that by 2 1/2 if the child is still soiling his pants, you are to make the child clean up the soiled pants himself! This is horrible...I have lost all respect for this person. If for whatever reason you like the philosophy of this book, don't assume another person will and subject them to this junk!"
1,Do some research on Gary Ezzo before buying any of his books,"http://www.ezzo.infoMy heart breaks for children parented the way Ezzo advocates. Children need to feel loved and secure, and need to be treated with respect.If you want convenience, don't have kids. Trying to fit them into a convenient schedule may seem appealing, but you're setting them up for emotional problems later by following this method."
1,Gary Ezzo has no credentials!,"Gary Ezzo started his program at Grace Community Church in Sun Valley, CA. The Church has recently evaluated and discontinued all programs of Gary's. The Ezzo's have absolutely no medical training. They are Evangelical Christians who believe the man makes all decisions in the household. The American Accademy of Pediatrics advised against the material in Baby Wise. Much has been written by different groups about Baby Wise being linked to dehydration, failure to thrive. It's easy enough to do a quick search on the author to see that his book promotes his theology beliefs. He was excommunicated from the Grace Church."
1,DO NOT READ,"To anyone wanting to buy ANY book by this man: Do your child and the world a favor by visiting the many anti-Ezzo websites first.I urge anyone who wants to read this book or any other book by Ezzo to read The Continuum Concept, by Jean Liedloff, first. Then you will have to see that Gary Ezzo is promoting child abuse/neglect. I shudder to think of what this nation will be like when millions of Ezzo babies are all grown up."
1,be careful,Be sure to check out ezzo.info before buying this book - the author is a dangerously unqualified man whose books have caused serious problems for many infants.
1,Baby Wise,"This is like so many parenting books out on the market today with a couple of significant exceptions. Parents that follow his advise, especially breastfeeding/feeding in the newborn period have higher risks of poor infant weight gain and dehydration.Why have a child if your going to submit them to being a guinnea pig? My advise- before you EVER try any advise such as this on your helpless infant- treat your spouse in this manner first for a month. Schedule your affection, food, comfort, etc. in this ame manner. If your marriage lasts then maybe concider trialing this type of behaviour on your helpless infant."
1,"dangerous, irresponsible and denounced by the AAP","gee, when the american assoc of pediatricians claims that this method can cause ""failure to thrive"" AND it goes against every maternal instinct ever created, AND the author basis his ""findings"" not from medical knowledge (he has no training) but HIS reading of the bible...All i say is READ ANYTHING ELSE!!"
1,bad book.. do some research about it!,i dont recommend this book for many reasons. you should do research on ezzo if you're thinking about purchasing this book. there's some info at this site.. http://www.ezzo.info/index.htm
2,CRAZY PHILOSOPHY!,"I BOUGHT THIS BOOK BECAUSE BABYWISE 1 TAUGHT US HOW TO GET OUR INFANT ON A SCHEDULE FOR FEEDINGS, NAPS, SLEEPTIME, SUCCESSFULLY. NOW THAT SHE IS 8 MONTHS I FIGURED BABYWISE II WOULD BE GOOD TO LEARN HOW TO DISCIPLINE HER. THERE ARE A ""FEW"" IDEAS I AGREED WITH. I AM NOT A FAN OF ATTATCHMENT PARENTING, BUT THIS BOOK IS OUT OF CONTROL. HE EXPLAINS THAT SINCE THE PRETODDLER CAN'T SPEAK THE PARENTS SHOULD ""TRAIN"" THE BABY HOW TO HAND SIGN FOR ""PLEASE"", ""I'M HUNGRY"", ETC. HE ALSO EXPLAINS THAT THERE SHOULD BE A CRIB TIME FOR WHEN THE BABY MISBEHAVES. THIS BOOK IS OUT OF CONTROL. IF YOU WANT YOUR BABY TO BE A TRAINED ROBOT ... GO AHEAD AND ORDER IT."
3,Insightful,"This is a great follow up to the first Baby Wise book. It continues with the ""sleep, eat, wake"" cycles, expands on it for your growing baby and adds the introduction to solid foods. I don't follow the ""rules"" to a T, but using this book as a guideline for our daily routine has resulted in countless compliments from everyone we meet about how healthy and happy my baby is, and how she is ""the most well behaved baby"" they have ever met."
3,a bit disappointing,"Unfortunately, I did not find this book as helpful as the Baby wise part ONE. I was expecting more practical tips as in the first book.SO I had to find more infos from a different book."
3,Good information but lacking a little,"I found good information in the book, but it wasn't as useful as the first Baby Wise book. The examples given are practical, and we've put some in place. However, after the great advise given in Baby Wise 1, I guess I expected more.It also describes things that are a couple of months off. For example, our baby is right where she should be developmentally, but in places where it describes a baby of her age, it is actually describing something that we won't be at for another couple of months. It's not that she's behind or even on the low end of the spectrum. It's simply that we've decided to listen to our pediatrician regarding somethings, and some are contrary to the book. This is particularly true when it comes to the introduction of solid foods.The wake-time activities in the book are spot-on though. We've implemented a couple of them with marked success."
2,Not as helpful as the first Babywise book,"I bought the original Babywise book before my daughter was born and it worked like a charm. However, this book is a lot less in-depth than the first one. I wish it talked more about different nap and sleeping styles. It assumes that just because you followed the first book your babies naps will automatically fall into a certain pattern. Not the case for my baby. She really is a fabulous sleeper and slept thru the night since 2 months old (11pm to 7am). However, now that she is getting to bed earlier (around 8pm) she wakes up playing in her crib around 3 or 4am, then again around 5am. She also takes a really long morning nap and a short afternoon and dinnertime nap. My point is, the book doesn't address that so it's really not helping me much."
3,"OKay, but not what I expected...","I swore to all my new Mommy friends that this was THE sleep book for them. When my son hit 5 months, I thought it would be only natural to following along the Babywise method for continuing his excellent sleep habits. While the book does address sleep patterns in older babies, it was focused more on eating, discipline, play, and other topics. I was hoping for more of the continuum described. Oh well, it was only a few $$ so worth those."
1,"Unsound, Unbiblical, Emotionally damaging","I have seen these principles in action and they are emotionally damaging to children. Buyer Beware: Unsound Biblical basis for these books. This is the secular version. Based on unsound methods that go against well known developmental truths. Choose Biblically sound, emotionally healthy Christian parenting such as that recommended by the Sears."
5,It worked for us!,"Hey, I think this book is not only great, but awesome! In just two weeks, our infant starting sleeping thru the night. Everyone who see our little girl comments on how alert and happy she is. She is three months old, and the pediatrican says she is extremely healthy, and we are not being governed by a baby's hourly demands. Instead we lead a normal life and our little girl fits in just perfectly. It takes a little bit more effort on the parents part at first, but the rewards are worth it. This is the way all children should be raised!"
1,Buy something else,"Give this one a miss, especially if you are breastfeeding. Lots of misinformation that can be a problem for lactating mothers. Plus, disturbing ideas about ""disciplining"" babies for perfectly normal behavior, like using their hands at mealtimes. I think these methods would be quite damaging. Look for something recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics, or try something by Dr. Sears or Penelope Leach instead."
1,DANGER!!,"This book should come with a warning label! Destructive to your childs physical & emotional health! Ezzo parenting theory would be more appropriate for raising a pet dog than a child. Mothers must be encouraged to trust their natural instincts in regard to parenting, this book will foster insecure mothers & fearful, subserviant children. Love your children, stay away from this book!"
2,not my style,too rigid and too religous for my taste. some good ideas if you can get past the pitfalls though.
4,Great book!,"I got the first book and had such success that I decided to buy this one too. It is wonderful. It gives you another perspective on things like naptime, discipline, table manners etc. I truly believe what the author writes about *training is easier than retraining*. I will more than likely buy the rest of his Babywise books."
1,"DON""T WASTE YOUR $ THIS MAN IS A MEAN HORRIBLE MAN","This man and some of the reviewers are lunatics. His idea of a child 5-12 months old who is learning to eat in the highchair and throws the food on the floor, is a child who should be punished by isolation. WHAT?? The CHILD, remember a child not one who is learning and not spiteful only understands by his method of punishment is that the one she loves, hates her. Is that really the way you want your lovely child to be raised? or our society? Doesn't our society have enough problems from unloved kids. I beleive in punishment and strict rules but when they are older and can reason. This man is not a doctor or a Psy. so where does his training come from? Maybe from his sadistic childhood. Compare this to all the other well researched and written child rearing books by educated normal people and you will concluded the same. Buy Dr. Dobsons book"
5,Continued success,"This book is a great follow-up to On Becoming Baby Wise. These time-honored practices have resulted in our two children possessing levels of self-control, obedience, and respect that are uncommon in today's world. We can actually take our children out in public without needing to make excuses for embarrasing behavioral problems, like loud demanding screams for candy in the grocery aisles or throwing food in restaurants. Gary Ezzo provides sound advice for raising children in a world gone awry with useless psycobabble."
4,Baby Wise Help,"The book has been very helpful in re-adjusting our 8 month old's sleeping pattern. I would recommend this to all, but read it early."
5,Parenting Books,"I ordered ""Baby Wise"" last Saturday, June 4, and received it yesterday, June 8! Great Service as promised. The book was in perfect condition. I now will have it to take as part of my baby shower gift for my niece this weekend. Thanks Again! I am very pleased!"
5,"Good read, most of it is practical and usable.",We're expecting our new baby and this book has some very practical and hands-on approach. We'll see what happens once our little girl arrives! :0)
2,Baby Wise for PreToddler Disappointing,"On Becoming Baby Wise Book II (Parenting your Pretoddler Five to Fifteen Months) was very, very disappointing. Only 10% of the book gives you advice on how to cope with siuations that are helpful. I wouldn't recommed this book to anyone."
2,Just Okay,"I would recommend the first and original Babywise book to anyone and everyone expecting a baby. This book doesn't even compare to the first. It has a few good pointers, but nothing earth-shatteringly helpful like the first book. I should also add that the editing is awful. This is a very quick read, but in my opinion probably not worth the money. Try to find it at the library."
1,A WASTE OF TIME & MONEY,This is incredible and goes to show you they will print anything and if it's in print people will think the author is an authority. I guess the people who buy this also buy the Star and other rag newspapers or they just have no common sense and want to validate their own crulity towards children
5,A life saver,"As first time parents and new to being around children, my husband and I found this book very helpful. While we aren't as strick as the book suggests, keeping our baby on a schedule has made our lives so much better! Since starting the schedule, we can now tell without a doubt whether he is hungry or tired where before we were just guessing. We thought our son had colic when in fact we were feeding him too often and not letting him get enough sleep. While I don't agree with being so strick to a schedule, it really has helped a lot to have some guidelines."
2,Try your insticts instead of this book.,"We had every intention of following this book to a tee when our son arrived. Several friends had raved about the system so we were gung-ho on it. We read the book, did the planning and got as ready as we could. Then our son arrived and everything changed.There some very good ideas that work in this book - parent directed feeding, etc. but the majority of it just wasn't practical or useful to us. What made the biggest difference in making our baby happy and comfortable was holding him and comforting him when he needed it - not by being stubbornly drawn to this ""formula"" for success. He's sleeping happily through the night at 8 weeks."
1,How to Raise a Sociopath,"A dangerous and often simply weird book that, while likely to help parents raise ""well-behaved"" and even ""easy"" young children, also builds the groundwork for the development of deeply pathological adolescents and adults. This book's approach flies in the face of all we know about child development and good parenting practices. If you believe the arguments in this book, or find yourself attracted to the picture it paints of childhood and child rearing, you should reconsider whether you should have children at all."
1,Dangerous and terrible!!!!!,"The advice offered in this book is not only unfounded, but also dangerous--particullary the suggested feeding schedule for breast-fed infants. The author of this book is not a pediatrician; he is a minister with no apparent knowledge beyond personal experience. While the author had consulted one pediatrician, many other pediatricians--indeed the majority asked--express serious concerns regarding the possible risks of malnurition and risks of developmental delays when following the book's guidelines. While the techniques suggested may be effective in training babies to sleep through the night, this is at the expense of your baby feeling secure in your ability to meet his or her needs. Makes for insecure and despondent children. If you truly wish to become baby-wise, check out: any of Dr. Sears' books, the Continuum Concept, or the Happiest Baby on the Block. Most importantly, listen to your baby and trust your own instincts. AVOID THIS BOOK!"
1,Horrible,"First of all, who is Gary Ezzo?? He has absolutely no experience in pediatrics, child development, neurology or lactation. However, reading the book you would think he was an expert!Do your research on the web before buying any of his junk. You will be enlightened. Www.ezzo.com is a wonderful site dedicated to informing our society on the dangers of Baby(un)wise."
1,Not so comical,"The statement that claims of attachment disorder and failure to thrive are ""comical"" by an earlier reviewer are not so comical if it happens to your own child. While I believe Ezzo's concept will work for some children with parents who are careful and mindful about what they are doing, I also believe strongly (and from experience) that if you have a child who is predisposed to react negatively to such input, whether it be from temperament differences or brain wiring, Ezzo's methods can aggrevate a problem that might have been avoided with a more nurturing method. Using Ezzo's plan is a bit like playing Russian roulette with your child."
1,"Attention ""Chrisitian"" Mothers who like Ezzo's philosophy","To the Washington state reviewer(go Cougs): The next time you are crying out to God in heart felt prayer, maybe He will choose to ignore YOUR pleas, as you have ignored YOUR baby! Dying to self and self- sacrifice on the part of a parent is BIBLICAL..Being too tired and selfish to attend to your baby is very UNBIBLICAL. Didn't Jesus say that what we have done for the least of these, we have done for Him! Children will have plenty of time to learn sacrifice and love- especially when they see the example of your own self-sacrifice( I hope yours WILL see this! ) By the way, I have eight blessings from God who ARE blessings, even though I met their needs as infants! (Amazing, huh? )"
5,"Very good, commonsense approach to parenting!","This book is a wonderful and well thought out GUIDELINE to parenting that does result in a very healthy and happy baby and brings harmony to the household... New moms and dads need to remember, when they read this book, it is a GUIDELINE. Weigh how much and how strictly you wish to follow and you will be very happy with the results."
5,Early Childhood Teacher's Must Have,"Great book on primary colors and fantastic lessons on color mixing and making secondary colors. The children in my class loved each and every lesson. Good classroom teaching, support and review tool for new Fine Arts teaching standards. A definite plus for your resource collection. Evan-Moor consistently has great books."
2,The second season gets worse,"Ricardo Montalban brought in for a second appearance in an episode dealing with a band of renegades carrying dark glasses and umbrellas and led by a fat man belongs more with Batman. The second is a pilot for a spinoff series which should never have been made! A girl agent joining a beauty contest to find a mind-destroying machine is definitely campy. No wonder this series eventually went into oblivion, its spinoff dying merely months before."
5,A book that belongs in your millennium library,"If you want to comprehend the environmental challenges that face the human family, read to the personal, emotionally moving, and scientifically potent words of the men and women whose lives have been devoted to the cause. Powerful and brilliant."
1,Piece of junk,Horribly designed item. No drainage so a sponge would just sit in any water that accumulates inside of it. It began rusting within two weeks of owning it. Ended up in the garbage can.
1,ugh,"i really didn't like this cd. singers can't sing, songs aren't catchy and tend to drag on. a chore to listen to. avoid!"
4,Cute horse,"This horse was smaller than I imagined but I can't say it's smaller than they say, I just thought it would be bigger/heftier or something. Also, it's legs aren't ""flopsie"" as I had assumed but are permanently bent for it to lay down which my daughter things is a bit weird (she actually keeps saying, ""Santa made it wrong""). All that being said, she still carries it around a bit and seems to have fun with it. We haven't even had it a week so I can't attest to it's durability but it has done fine so far."
5,GORGEOUS!!!,"WOW!!! What a wonderful book! The artwork is AMAZING!!! If you're really into the art of animation, or are just a big fan of the movie itself, GET THIS BOOK!!! It's one of Disney's best 'art of' books!"
1,Seagate refuses to honor the warranty,"I bought this drive in May, 2007. It was advertised as having a three year warranty, and I have a PDF copy of the Maxtor spec sheet that confirms this model has a three year warranty.The drive failed in August, 2008, 15 months after purchase. Seagate, which bought Maxtor back in 2006, refuses to replace the drive or honor the warranty. They wrote ""We have seen this before, and I am sorry to say the drive only had a 1-year warranty"" -- clearly, the reason they've seen this before is because the drive was marketed as having a three year warranty.A longer warranty doesn't mean a hard drive is less likely to fail. But I would never buy a drive with a one year warranty. And I would never buy from a company that refuses to honor its warranties.That's two good reasons not to buy this drive."
5,No problems...,"Other folks have talked about their hard drive was mishandled in shipping, etc, causing it to arrive DOA. I had no problems. I could have taken the Maxtor retail box and punted it off of my roof, retrieved the box, take the brand new hard drive out and put it in with no damage. Make sure you have serial ATA before you get this drive."
2,Not Very Reliable,I have had nothing but trouble with hard drives made by Maxtor and now that they are owned by Seagate it does not appear that they have improved on the quality at all.I purchased this 500GB SATA II internal hard drive last November and it started to die in less than 60 days. When you turn on the computer you can hear the drive try to start up but that is all it does. I have to restart my PC 20 plus times before the drive it will actually start up. Lucky for me I was able to get it to start up and backed up before it died altogether.I would not recommend anything with a Maxtor name on it to anyone. My Western Digital drives have been working just fine and I should have got one but I was tempted by the price of the Maxtor unit. BIG mistake.
4,"Fast, but unstable","Very fast and tons of space, however on my Vista machine, it locks up completely about once every 2 or 3 days."
2,Not as I expected,"I am in the process of decorating my new apartment and thought this book would be a great idea. Not only are the photos of poor quality but the so-called decor is awful. I do not recommend this book for anyone who wishes to decorate stylishly. Also, the book is not that informative about buying on eBay."
1,Not the best way to learn Japanese,"As a person who is quickly trying to learn Japanese before going over to Japan to teach, I have tried everything. This program is one of the worst approaches I have seen. It is way too fast and very intimidating and frustrating. It works alright if it is only way part of the learning process. There are many computer programs and tapes that do a much better job."
4,Nice and enjoyable,"Don Pasquale is a nice and typical comic opera. It has the fool, the lovers, the owner of the mischief, false identities, etc. But it also has some more real and human scenes, with the appropriate music, of compassion. It is entertaining and the music is Bell canto at its best.The main actors are very good, but not exceptional (thus the 4 stars) you end up with a good taste of the opera but not with an extremely or incredible WOW. The staging is nice and appropriate, no need for difficult interpretations. All the singers act very convincingly making the overall experience enjoyable.It is filmed life at the Met so there are some audio issues from time to time. The channel the voice is coming out (in the 5.1 mode) is some time puzzling and the sudden change in volume bothered me some. I don't know if it could be fixed with software wizardry.Overall a nice experience to enjoy on a winter evening."
3,PFM - Moves In A Fusion Direction,"The ""Jet Lag"" album is a real departure for PFM. For this one the band moved away from bombastic progressive rock and created an album focused on more fusion oriented jazz rock. How much you like this album will depend on how much you like this style. Being a fan of PFM's more heavy rock approach on their earlier stuff I am not as thrilled with this album as some people are. Still the instrumental sections are stellar and the more jamming aspect of the album does hit significant high points. The vocals of Bernardo Lanzetti leave a bit to be desired as he sings in a kind of weird vibrato style that only half works. Overall this is a weaker PFM album, but if you like more fusion oriented progressive rock you may really enjoy this one."
2,Is there a sheep on the loose???,"I bought this album based on a review I read here...boy am I sorry! First, I am a big fan of PFM. I have been a fan since Cook came out and even had the opportunity to see them perform live. They have always been outstanding musicians HOWEVER vocally they have always been a bit weak. The addition of Lanzetti did not help that problem. We actually call him ""goat boy"" as he bleets out in sharp vibrato. This album is weak compared to Chocolate Kings where Lanzetti's style is at least tolerable. This sounds like a bunch of jams put together. I bought this because a review said it was PFM playing jazz...trust me, it's not. It sounds like the jam sessions we used to have in the garage!"
3,Jet Lag for the fans,"This CD is a recompilation from their discs previously recorded at Italy (Europe in general), so they try to made a disc to create a good expectation in America, that's why the title. For the Fans who knows the musical stream of this group, may be it's a reverse, however, not as good as the original discs previous to this. But for somebody who tries to know the origin of PFM and don't want to dig a lot, it's perfect."
3,too small,"This car cove is fine, except it doesn't fit the car. It would be nice if in the description there were dimensions mentioned."
3,car cover,nice cover but I dont care for the fabric quality ...very thiok and a bit tricky to manuver..good price and I am happy with it though.
1,Cover Disintegrated within 2 mo - Amazon flaked on return,"Cover design was fine, held on during windy summer days. Takes less than 2 minutes to put on or take off.After a month, though, the cover started feeling powdery and gradually began to tear easily, just by lifting it against its own weight. This is while stored in a suburban driveway in the SF Bay area and removed 1-2 times per week.Coverking's response: James, Sep 20 11:18 (PDT): Hello, for returns you would need to contact Amazon.com, as they were your point of sale, and have them request a return number for warranty repair/replacement.Amazon's system is also well-designed: to completely frustrate a purchaser who has this kind of problem.I've bought 1000's of $ of stuff through Amazon and have been almost always satisfied.I replaced this cheap cover with a $70 one with a 10-yr warranty from a local auto parts store."
2,Sincerely written...but,"Mr. Fraioli's book is certainly a wonderful work about sticking to something and getting where you wish to be. However, I found it interesting that his name isn't found in the crew listing for either Ace Ventura nor Wild America. Of course, this could be a simple oversight...but still.In my opinion the situations seemed a bit ""staged"" and in a lot of ways cliched. He does try to inspire, however and for that I give him two stars."
1,Shocking and Disturbing,"Until this book I was a fan of romace novels and Connie Mason in particular. The blatant abuse and racism in this book was shocking! Our ""Hero"" rapes two wives, beats his slaves, and still ends up with the girl at the end. Our ""Heroine"" sleeps with anybody who befriends her or for whom she has pity. I wanted to see them both dead at the end. Unless you want to be disillusioned forever, DON'T read this book!"
1,why did i even bother to finish it?!,"I swear to god, the only thing missing from this book was incest. It was simply disturbing. at one point the heroin is given an aphrodisiac and sold to some fat merchant. we get a very disturbing description of how he uses her body in every vile way while she screams for more (if her mouth is not busy that is) and the hero! ... the heroin also gets her share of men. do not, I repeat, do not read this book! I admit that I like books with strong bodice ripping themes but this was disgusting! stay away!"
4,A Keeper (even if you hate the hero),"I would have given the book 5 stars except for one thing- Philippe. He is one of the most hypocritical, mentally unstable characters I ever read about. He is constantly on poor Gabby's case. He puts her on a pedestal and then he saws it down.Throughout the novel he insults her, then apologizes-""Mon amour, I'm so sorry, I don't what came over me"" (kiss kiss). It seems barely into the next scene that the abuse starts all over again. And he wonders why she keeps running away. I don't want to start on his philandering."
1,Waste,"Packed with racist overtones, glorifies abuse of all kinds, and based on a hero and heroine who repeatedly cheat on each other yet somehow claim to still love each other. . . .What a waste of time! I had to force myself to continue reading this . . . It was torture."
2,oh 1985,"This book is great...for laughs! Living with all women I can't even begin to say how many hours of belly laughs this book has brought to us. Between the poor writing and the simply silly plot I would not recommend this book for serious readers, or for anyone looking to buy. But if you can get a hold of a free copy this book is great fun to read aloud at a slumber party or otherwise all-female gathering. Bring your sense of humor, terrible fake accents, and check your maturity at the door!"
3,"Connie Mason's first novel, what do you expect?","I absolutely love Connie Mason, i have read almost all her books. This was the first novel she had ever written and it is defientely a different writting style from her other books. I wish people would stop trying to get other readers and Mrs. Mason fans to stop reading her books because this is not her best book. Continue reading all her books, she has not disappointed me yet!"
3,Mon Dieu!,"I got so frustrated w/ his mistress in the picture and the guy friend who kept showing up to drool all over Gabby. The couple had fantastic sex together, yet both cheated! Some major conflicts in this one, mostly all built on misunderstandings. uggg. Of course, I still read and enjoyed the steamy scenes. yummy. in. detail."
2,Not the nice quality as ever,Ibought this bikini thinking gottex but the bra is deformed somehow on the cups.
5,Sturdy and well priced,"We have a small studio in our office for promotional videos and we needed a pro-am grade stand that could balance our mic and have a small foot print in our small space. This stand does just that and has a sturdy build. For the price I was expecting a lower quality and weight, but the On Stage tripod is doing a fine job."
2,"Wow, what a let down on the delivered product","First of all, I received a used stand - totally used. It was shipped in the original retail box completely haphazardly with clear tape all over it except for where all the tears and rips were. I open it and it was a complete mess. Paper with some other company's logo stuffed in to keep it from moving and scratches and scrapes all over the stand and boom poles. Obviously assembled a disassembled numerous times. No instructions. No packing slip and a missing (very crucial) screw bolt. That would be the screw bolt that keeps the boom attached to the stand - kind of crucial.I gave this 2 stars because had I received this as new, with instructions and not scratched up, this looks like a nice stand. But my experience is so tainted because I very much need this in 2 days and it's not going to happen. I've never been so disappointed by an Amazon delivery - ever."
4,A princely read ~,"I got this book after hearing its author and, earlier, the subject of the book, interviewed on ""Imus in the Morning"" several years ago. The mayor sounded like a colorful character and the author seemed an engaging sort who would write an interesting book. True on both counts. It is interesting, readable, and detailed almost to a fault. Recommended."
5,Wow! What a great guide!,"Thank you, Kiki, for this great book! My marriage had become ""stale"" and I was looking for something simple that I could try to get my love life back in action. While the other books sounded too involved or too extreme, yours sounded just right. And it was! The first night I picked a tip and my husband was amazed! We are now back in action and loving it! Your book continues to give us inspiration. Thanks!"
3,Clayfighter,"Clayfighter is a some what average video game fighter although entertaining to play. In the game you play as one of eight characters to become the best circus clay fighter around. The best part of the game is its sense of humar, it has some pretty funny gag jokes with the characters. However, the worst part of Clayfighter would be its speed, the fighter can some times move or react slow, that can be annoying. But the game is entertainning to play for a couple of minutes, then put it away. Overall, Clayfighter is a pretty good game to play on those rainy days."
3,Cut and cut again,"It was exciting to see this on the shelf in the record store. It was a trifle disappointing to see that it was a 1961 recording. And it was terribly disappointing to read in the liner notes that this is a cut version of Lina Mendelssohn's cut version (three acts) of Prokofiev's original four act opera. If you're the type of hardcore collector who has Katerina Ishmailova along with Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk, then buy this. If you're the type of hardcore Prokofiev fan who cannot wait for Gergiev's performance of the complete opera (he IS going to do that, isn't he?), then buy this. It's not nearly as exciting as Semyon Kotko, which Gergiev has done, brilliantly, but it's by Prokofiev, so it can't be ALL bad."
3,I Promise You'll Survive This Opera!,"STORY OF A REAL MAN is one of those patriotic, ""rehabilitative"" works, which modernistic (experimental) composer Sergei Prokofiev was ""encouraged"" to write by the Soviet Union's culture police -- or else! -- that was intended to glorify the state and appeal to the nationalistic pride of the common man. The opera extols the travails and heroism of a valiant Soviet pilot, shot down and wounded by enemy fire from above.It's certainly listenable...it has its moments -- but if you depart this world without ever having heard it, you won't have missed anything all that extraordinary."
1,Do Not Buy Here,"The item sold is not as respresented. When I purchased this book, I was under the assumptiong that I was purchasing the actual Red Pony and the Pearl book, both classic short novels by Steinbeck. That was what was advertised. What I got was an analysis of the books by some English professor, ie some cliff notes account of the books. Not what I ordered... I feel ripped off."
2,The Red Pony,"i would like to find out online what the red pony is about ,i read this book beore,but i can't remember everthing ,my book report is due in 3 days and i havn't did it yet....."
2,A Very Different Story for Reeman Fans,"With an interest stemming from a former life as naval officer; I am a passionate reader of naval fiction. After reading maybe twenty of his works; I have read found Douglas Reeman and his Alexander Kent persona to be among the very best within this genre.I concur completely with the earlier reviewers on the setting and context of this novel. As is always true in his stories, the character development and story tension is full, rounded, and well written. However, I found that this very framework and its pace created a challenge for me as a reader. The storyline presented a picture that was much like the mundane constrained readiness, the minor conflicts, and the day-to-day sameness of operations that forward deployments entailed during the cold war.Page after page of this book, I asked where is the ""up-and-down"" ride that I have come to expect from Reeman... But it never seemed to come. I found The White Guns difficult to read and a very large disappointment."
2,"Interesting, when not evangelizing","I agree with the earlier review that this book has so much fundamentalist rantings that it is hard to enjoy it. About half of the book is totally unnecessary, trite, irrational, and illogical religious supposition with no basis in logic or reality. Anyone familiar with Steve Quayle won't be surprised to read his theories, like evil is proof of God and Satan because, somehow, humans can't conceive of premeditated, devious, evil acts without divine help.The accounts of giants are very interesting, if you can get past the rest of the book."
2,some interesting informational tidbits but mired in fundamentalist commentary,"This could have been a 4 or 5 star book if the author had refrained from frequently interjecting his Christian fundamentalist opinion. Those looking for historical facts will have to sift through the dogmatic fluff, which can be annoying at times."
1,Fearmongering and religious bigotry,"Quayle can present some interesting information. Unfortunately it is undermined by his zealous religious bigotry. In some places he sounds reasonable and credible. In others, like a fundamentalist whack job."
4,This is a worthwhile book,"We routinely use the bread recipes from this book for dealing with our child's multiple food allergies. Until we had this book, we did not think you could bake decent bread without wheat - but you can!Between this book and ""Great Foods Without Worry"" by Cindy Moseley we have a lot of good choices for recipes that are compatible with multiple food allergies."
2,too much mayo!,I was very disappointed that so many recipes call for mayonnaise. It would have been helpful to know this prior to ordering. Sadly I ordered several cookbooks at once and it was too late to return when I discovered this fact.
5,The gluten-Free Gourmet: Living Well,"Good recipes! What's not to like. I will be using the recipes more and more in the near future for me and my family. Thanks, Katherine Bacon"
4,On time and Tasty,It arrived on time and the recipes are great. The book was in excellent condition.
5,GF Gourmet,This is a very helpful book. I'm new to the GF world and this answered alot of questions plus gave information that is quite helpful. Lots of great looking recipes that I'll have to try. The author also makes it sound as though making one's own pasta would be easy.
3,Was Huey Hungover?,"OK, one of the main reasons I bought this was for Dan Hill's ""Can't We Try"" and Huey's ""I Know What I like""; however, this is the most pathetic version of ""I know what i like"" ive ever heard. It's rerecorded and sounds like Huey was asked to re-record this after a long night of binge drinking. At some parts, he's even scatting as if he's forgotten the words. Not only that, but the entire choruses are missing and only instrumental? What? Have no idea where Madacy picked up this recording - but at least the rest are originals."
5,wonderful book for grandchildren,"This is a beautifully written book purchased for my 6 year old to read to his ""grandaddy"". My stepdad cried when he read it to him (he's very sentimental). Recommended for all children, but especially resonates with Black children in relation to their grandaddies."
2,Squidward,"Squidward was purchased for our 3 yr old grand daughter. When Squidward arrived in the small box, his neck was bent. Bob at BB Toys offered to replace him for us. He told us he thought that's why Squidward was being retired because of his neck not being strong. We figured since a 3 yr old would be playing with him his neck would get alot looser as time goes by so we decided not to worry about it. I will purchase from this company again as they were very nice to deal with and offered to replace Squidward. Thanks Bob."
3,life saver,"We had to go on a weekend trip and my cat didn't have a sitter so thankfully these arrived on time and we didn't have to take him to ""pet-care"" for the weekend. It stayed fresh cool and clean until we could arrive home."
5,Like you're holding a piece of history...,"... And you are! This is a fantastic, accurate account of the happenings around Plymouth, from the words of William Bradford himself. I got this book for my husband as a Christmas present and he loved it! (I got an old, 1800's edition, in the original 1600s language.)"
5,Great Receiver,"After researching many receivers for a few months I decided on this one. With all the features it has you can't beat it for the price. The main thing i was looking for was many inputs with the video upgrading to have everything come out to component. This feature seems to work very well, although i have no prior experience with video upgrade to compare it to. Its a really solid well built receiver and hopefully it lasts years to come. I had read in reviews about it running hot and this is very true. It has no fan and the one draw back is i had to give up room that another component could have sat in as i had to leave quite a bit of space on top for cooling. As I said before you can't beat it for the price and it comes from a good brand. In the price range this one falls in, there were many cheaply made models with less features."
4,Excellent book,"One of the best books out there on the understanding of patterns. Along with ""Permaculture, a Designers manual"" (see my review) and ""A pattern language"" this book rates as a must have for any serious IT designer."
4,An autobiography,"In general, I was surprised at how much of the book was an autobiography. While I found most of the author's experience appropriate, I thought the chapters about Lucid's demise went on *far* too long and appeared a bit out of sync with the rest of the book. I'm convinced these chapters were written for the author's emotional benefit.I found the concepts of habitability and compression remarkable as the author used them to frame old discussions in a new way. Echoing a previous reviewer's comments, I was captivated by the discussion on rugs as well as the book's final chapter. Lastly, I'd like to thank the author for recommending Williams' ""Style: Towards Clarity and Grace."" Based on his recommendation, I bought a copy this afternoon. It definitely belongs on the A list."
4,Kreg KMS7215 Micro-Adjuster,good product! there are alot of uses arount a wood/metal shop. It has plenty of adjustment for powertool fences. Works well for veneering.
4,Wood Shop Tool,"While the item is what I had expected, it was previously ordered and received. Yet for some unknown reason it was AGAIN included with the order for CD's"
3,Mostly a gimmick,"I bought this for my Kreg band saw fence and while I like the fence a lot, this little thing is sort of a waste of money. For one, it's difficult to use; the wheel is really small and it's difficult to turn with any tension on the main fence. Here's the rub, in order to move the fence with this thing, you have to unlock the fence but only a little - so that there is still some tension on it, thus making it difficult to move. In the end, I find that the precission is lost when the fence is loosened and tightened anyway. A tap on the fence actualy works better and is easier to do. The second problem is that with this thing attached, you can't just lift the fence off the table when you don't want to use the fence. The way this attaches to the track, you have to unscrew it all the way to take it off - a bit of a pain although not terrible. So, 3 stars since it seems pretty well made, but I probably would not buy it again."
4,just a tad,"I bought this option just 'cause it was inexpensive relative to the kreg fence. But when I needed just another 15 thousandth after making the 1st cut (in metal), you were there. It's a must buy with the fence."
2,poorly designed,"I found that when you tighten the wing nut it drives the adjustment thumb wheel into the surface of the table. There is only one bearing surface on the side opposite the thumb wheel. I put a shim under the adjuster where the screw goes through the mount. This kept the wheel off of the table allowing it to move smoothly. A real pain, but at least I can use it.Naturally this solution only works if the track is flush to the table surface (or you are using a wide track)"
2,Not easy to use,"I purchased the micro adjuster to go with the kreg band saw fence. I had a hard time setting up the micro adjuster, in fact I never got it to work correctly. It hindered the smooth back and forth movement of the fence and actually made the set up more difficult. I finaly gave up and returned the product. The fence on the other hand works great-very high quality and accuracy."
2,Divas RE-covered,"Being a fan of the WWE divas, I was really looking forward to this book. Unfortunately this is just an OVERPRICED version of the Divas magazine which comes out once a year. A number of the photos have been seen elsewhere and the cliched quotes like ""It's what is inside a person that counts"" really don't give us any new insight into what these incredible women are REALLY all about.If you DO feel the need to purchase this book, wait until it comes out in paperback. Definitely not worth 30 dollars!!"
5,excellent product,"The product is easy to use, with clear instructions. I've purchased it a couple of times and it worked perfectly. There was no mess and I've been able to re-use my cartridges more than once. The savings are significant, and I would highly recommend this refill rather than new or rebuilt cartridges."
4,"Clean crisp, easy to use and effortlessly professional","If you want to have a card for all occassions, it's easy - just get these Business cards and you can make up as many as you need, with whatever design you want...These cards allow me a flexibility that vista cards do not, so I can change them subtly if I need to. They also print easily and don't smudge, and break apart cleanly. The final product looks completely professional.That being said, if you need 500 identical cards, I would go to a professional printer. But if you only need small amounts and things change as you go, then these are a terrific option. Happy to use them and would buy again."
4,Good looking cards,"These are a nice improvement over the older style printable card stock. They separate very cleanly, by 'snapping' then inwards towards you.I printed on both sides using the templates from the site provided in the instructions. It was intuitive enough for the average user to setup the cards and print them easily.The colors were vivid, and did not smear when you rubbed your fingers over the cards, after leaving them sit for a few minutes to let them set.All in all a good value, and they look good enough to substitute for print shop printed cards."
4,Good if you need to be able to immediately make business cards,"These Avery business card sheets are good for a limited set of uses. For most business card needs, you're going to get a much lower cost per card by having your cards professionally printed and mass-produced by a professional printing company. If price is the ultimate consideration, you would be better off going with an outfit like [...]. However, these Avery sheets definitely fill a niche, which is being able to instantly print out business cards in an emergency or on-demand. If you want to be able to edit/modify and instantly print a small supply of business cards personally, on-site, then these Avery sheets are one of the best solutions. They are very high-quality, considering they are for personal printer use."
4,worked great for me,Worked great for me on my hp officejet v40. Edges are very clean and professional looking. Thickness is good. I wish Avery provided a greater selection of templates on their site.
1,A cut above the rest...,"These clean edge two-side printable cards are definitely a ""cut above the rest"". The look is about as professional as you can get with such ease. The ink adheres naturally without smudge or wet look. These are absolutely worth the little extra you pay!"
5,Awesome Business Cards!,"These business cards do what they say! The print well - both sides - they don't smudge and they 'fold apart' beautifully. The 'folding' causes them to snap which leaves a super clean, slightly beveled edge cut to the cards. They truly end up looking as if you just picked them up at the printers. Great product at a very decent price!"
4,"Sound product, inexpensive","I had thought that perforated sheets of business cards must necessarily look cheap. That's not true. These are quite good, although clearly not the product of a print shop.The accompanying software has a reasonable Mac version, but be warned: If you want a set of identical cards printed, front AND back, then you need to specify this; it's not the default. If you forget, you'll wind up with one good business card and seven with the front and/or back displaying the default logo."
4,AVERY BC for inkjet,"Easy to use, Avery has great instructions and support to get what you need for any office programs. Printed without a hitch in my hp oj 6000. Kind of pricey when i add up price of cards and ink. can get them professionally done for similar price point when all is said it done with my exspenses. Paper quality is just mmmhmm OK. Edges arent to sharp and they break out of paper fairly easy. Thanks to avery I was able to quickly setup and print my first rough draft of a business card. Satisfied customer who will probably try thier nicer product line (glossy finish for a more professional look over matter)."
3,Not great but ok,I've tried using the directions and word template and no matter how I size my image their is some blank space along the right side of bottom of the card. The card prints well and comes apart well.It tends to bend toward the back a bit and feels about half as thick as a normal business card.Biggest problem is printing the entire card.
3,quality business cards,"If It didn't take 2 days of trying to get these to work, because the sever is always busy, I would have gave 5 stars if this was not the case"
2,Thickness?,"Boy, this card is thin (still thicker than a regular sheet of paper). Nowhere on the package is the gauge (thickness) and if I knew what I know now I probably would not have purchased this.Printing and seperating the cards was very easy though."
3,Doesn't seem to agree with all printers...,"The clean-edge part of this product is terrific....however, I can't seem to get it to align properly all the way down the sheet. The first 2 or 4 cards are perfectly aligned, but as the printer makes its way down the sheet the image starts to shift and is no longer printing completely on the card. It appears that this has occurred with other people as well. (I am using an HP 970Cse inkjet) I suppose I can pull out my old Lexmark and see if that will work. I'm not ready to give up - this really is a nice looking product - thick cards and clean edges. If you do want to try it, just make sure you are prepared for the fact that it might not work on your printer."
5,Great product,I have used these for a few years now and I really like how nice they break apart. No more of that perforated looking edge. These snap apart clean and are a nice weight paper.
3,Nice product but not for my printer.,I really like these double sided cards. They are just what I needed and would be great if they would work right but no matter what I do they wont align properly in my printer....HP DESKJET D4160. They print out of the boxes so I cant use any of the cards at all. I tried entering the Avery card stock number and other numbers but no luck. It prints properly on a sheet of paper but not on the card stock.
1,No Stars,"I wish that I had read this before buying at my local office supplier. My cards print blurred, and I have reset the printer settings for all kinds of specialty paper, trying to find one that works. I have an HP 2200 series. Maybe it is a problem with HP printers? Nonetheless, it is not compatible with MY laser printer, and as HP is one of the most popular out there, it should not be advertised as such."
1,Broke my printer,"The 2nd sheet of business cards through my printer, jammed in my printer. In removing the jammed sheet of cards, I broke my printer."
3,easy to use but paper is a little flimsy,I created cards with ease- using both Microsoft Word and the Avery print website. My only complaint is that the paper could be a little less flimsy; they seem a little cheap.
4,Good for Home Projects,Good for making your own business cards for a pretty reasonable price. Whether your starting your own business or just want to show off to your friends it's a pretty decent product. The cards are a little thinner than normal but that's probably so that it fits and feeds through your printer properly. They are very easy to use and can be done by using no software. Avery has provided a website for uploading images or choosing from pre-made templates. Overall it's a nice product and you get a decent amount for the price.
5,Very nice bright white smooth crisp professional high quality business cards,"The heavy, stiff paper used for these is very smooth and bright white for crisp, clear, text and high res. photos, and logos, and other graphic arts. These are some of the best quality inkjet printable perforated business cards I have ever felt. Usually they're much less stiff and crisp. These are very nearly top professional business card quality.And the new feature of smooth edges is very nice also. Most perforated business cards have obvious perf edges. These have good edges. Yay."
4,Practice makes perfect,Very easy to use once you figure out how to pop them out. It took me a couple sheets of practice to get the hang of it. Convenient for small events where you don't need too many cards or if you like to do them as needed. The software was a bit confusing to use and the graphics didn't align correctly with the first sheet. Had to tweak the formatting to get it lined up. Overall very nice.
2,wouldn't do it again,"Not sure if it was the program or my printer but, one side of the cards printed half way between the cards. Tried several times and never worked. Also some sheets come apart in the printer. Might work in different printer or with a different program, but didn't work for me."
3,Clean Edges... good appearance... but...,"Avery is right about one thing, the only way that you might find cleaner edges would be to go to a professional print shop. Honestly, there is little difference between do-it-yourself cards using the Avery Clean Edge Business Cards and commercially printed ones.Why have 250 or 500 cards printed for you at a modest (yet spam-inducing) cost, when you can customize your own? This would be perfect for job hunters! You can produce a few at a time, customized to your search and your career targets. And Avery provides plenty of design templates for you if you're a little uncertain as to how you want to get started.The downside? Maybe it's my HP printer... or maybe it's Avery, but I had to throw away the bottom row or two of a sheet because the text and artwork tended to creep up with each successive row. You can adjust that, but you might waste a few sheets in the process. I expected a little more in that, but now that I know better, I can deal with it."
2,Lightweight cards,"These are economy weight cards, although they may be adequate for some uses. Because of this light weight, I don't think they are a good buy. Avery makes other business cards that are better. The Avery on-line templates are more effort to use than they are worth and most require that you have MS Word 2007 to use them."
3,What price a clean edge?,"The edges are very clean and neat, which seems to be the main selling point for these cards. You just fold all 4 edges of the sheet to remove the borders, then separate each card by folding them where they join. The card stock is very good quality, if a little thin for some people's taste.I followed the instructions to go online and download a template. The instructions did not match what I saw and it took some time to get the template. The choice of designs was unimpressive and the template was not particularly user-friendly. I soon gave up and resorted to using Word.You should also take note of prices. These cards are relatively expensive. Shop around a little and ask yourself if you are willing to pay a premium for good quality, clean-edged cards.[PeterReeve]"
4,Inexpensive But Professional Results,"I'm a novice at trying to print my own business cards, and these cards worked fine, and I was able to produce high quality, lost-cost business cards as a result. The only problem I encountered was getting the cards through my printer, but that was my issue, not a reflection of the cards themselves!"
4,Love these cards,"I make handcrafted pens from exotic woods and sell them at craft shows. I have a card made up for each kind of wood that I use and give it with the pen when I sell them. I only have 27 different flavors of woods and 10 different styles of pens, each with its own care card. Add to that my own card and that makes a lot of cards to be printing and cutting!I've been doing the cards the hard way and printing them on card stock and then cutting them out. With these its so much easier! The only thing about them is that sometimes they dont separate clean. Sometimes the cards don't come apart clean and it pulls up a little feather of paper on the edge ruining that card. That's why I only gave them four stars. Now if I can get them in different colors I'll never use card stock for them again!"
3,Lots of fun but not practical,"Okay, this could be fun as a project, however, there are a few things that just make this a mediocore purchase at best. First, the edges are not as sharp as a cut card. Second, the cost per card is very high compared to what you can get online. The paper does take the ink relatively well, but there are so many variables, e.g. ink quality, etc., that may effect the outcome. These are things you don't have to worry about when you order from a company. This is probably best for someone who is just starting out and has very specific designs that cannot be met by any online company (I can't imagine who that would be for). You can easily find a place to give you five hundred cards for about the same price...with the front and back printed and possibly embossed. I guess if you need a some cards quickly this is for you. If you can wait a week or so, look online, there are some really great places that will make up some beautiful cards for you."
4,Much better than the tear apart cards!,Break apart with nice clean edges. They look very good when used with a good quality printer. Edges break right apart and nothing to clean up.
5,incredible value,this is an incredible value. its almost twice the price at your local office supply big box. works great on our printers and gives a clean proffesional edge.
5,easy to use,"I bought it at office depot, I was able to make nice looking business card using my brother inkjet printer. I used Microsoft Word, nothing fancy but I think it look professional."
2,"So, so.","I like the clean edge cards. The only thing I don't like doing, and I've had to do this on other busincess card paper, was to trim the edges with a cutter. Every time. The calibration didn't work for me and I followed the instructions as written.If you don't mind having to trim them further, than what you need, either that, or don't use any color near the edges. Because you may get a white strip that has to be cut."
4,'76 scores,"Rock On's 1976 collection is a nice combination of styles from the era. You get some disco with Vicki Sue Robinson's ""Turn The Beat Around"", white boy funk with Wild Cherry's ubiquitous ""Play That Funky Music"", blue-eyed Philly soul from Hall & Oates with their first big hit, the beautiful ""Sara Smile"", r&b from Earth, Wind & Fire on the smooth ""Can't Hide Love"" and California soft rock from England Dan & John Ford Coley on ""I'd Really Love To See You Tonight"". War's ""Summer"" perfectly encapsules the feeling a lazy summer day with a great Latin flavored groove. Martin Balin gives one of his best vocal performances on Jefferson Starship's sweet ""With Your Love"" and future Starship lead singer Mickey Thomas sings lead on Elvin Bishop's ""Fooled Around & Fell In Love"". There are some clunkers like the saccharine ""Afternoon Delight"" by The Starland Vocal Band and the ridiculously awful ""Money Honey"" from The Bay City Rollers."
3,"The classic is great, but the editing mistakes are annoying","I love Anne of Green Gables but found myself being pulled out of this book by all the editing mistakes (misspelled words, etc.). I definitely recommend the story, but not this edition of it."
1,horrible book,this book was recommended to me by a worker at petco and i did not like the book. I thought annes character was to coincedencal and sort of boring. I wasn't amazed by the book and felt it should be re written because of its lack of interest and i found a few grammar mistakes.
5,Charming Book,"I could just be overly nostalgic but in re-reading this book as an adult I loved it even more than when I was a child. Gentle, sentimental, funny, and touching. A wonderful book to share with any daydreaming girls in your life. To put it into costume drama terms, it's a kindred spirit to Lark Rise to Candleford and Cranford."
2,Horrible,The tingle in your skin when ou take Niacin is unbearable. I see why the dr tells you to take it during the night while you sleep.
5,Great Price,Received the item promptly. The cost was substantially lower than getting it locally. Even less expensive using subscribe and save feature.
3,Probably a good product,"I bought these to hopefully help stimulate blood flow in my eyes and ears. Time will tell. I do miss the ""Flushing"" I used to get when I took niacin back many years ago. I have sinced found non time release niacin which is not non flushing."
1,cheap,Yes its cheap but its not pure.Swanson claims they test their stuff for purity but you cannot get a copy of the results.I found contaminates in the product.
5,Niacin Swanson,"This is actually Niacin, Vitamin B3 --not the impostor inositol-- so it actually works to lower triglycerides, and Swanson's is VASTLY less expensive than prescription niacin, even cheaper than my health insurance co-pay. The strength from what I can tell via flushing is consistent from capsule to capsule."
3,More frequent flushing,"I use to take Niaspan 2000 mg/day. It caused my blood sugar to rise, but my cholesteral when down. I take the 500 mg niacin to maintain. I find that I get more frequent flushing on the 500 mg than the 2000 mg niaspan. They say the flushing is good for you, but boy does it hurt. My body just doesn't seem to be adjusting well. I've been taking it for a month now. And I know what your thinking, but I do not eat spicy or fatty foods before taking it."
3,IF U NEED IT,"IT GAVE ME A VERY STRONG HISTAMINIC REACTION ALL OVER MY BODY AND LOT OF ITCHINESS, ALTHOUGH IT WAS MY FAULT, MY DOSE WAS TOO HIGH, BUT IF YOU NEED IT TAKE IT WITH MEDICAL SUPERVISION IT'S MY RECOMMENDATION."
3,"Secretariat, I mean Whirlaway","Georgeff's book is very well written. However, he often goes off on tangents that have nothing to do with the current subject or even the chapter. For instance, he'll be talking about Secretariat and suddenly, without transition, we will hear once more how Whirlaway was the greatest horse ever (and he was beautifully named). Again, a great piece of writing, if only a little off track at times."
5,Great Product - No problems!,"We had this exact model in our office, and the laser went kaput on us. Rather than buy a new laser for it and pay for a service call, we decided to get a refurbished model because we really like the model, and didn't want to test the waters with any other model. The printer we got was refurbished and just a bit banged up - but it works great and is meeting our needs 100%. No problems with delivery - it arrived quickly and works fine!"
5,Hot,"This stuff is amazing. So much so that in a celebrity review of scents, CHRIS NOTH (from Sex & the City) went crazy over it. Trust me...you'll have to beat the guys off with this."
4,Good all-over workout...not too crazy about the instructor,"I'll agree with what most people have said: the 10 minute segments are excellent for quick yet effective workouts. However, I did find the instructor annoying and the cues off. She'll show you a squat move then say, ""Let's do a set of 8!"". After the 8, she'll say, ""Ok, let's do one more set!"" After finishing that set, she'll say, ""Can you do 8 more? I think you can!"" This is annoying, and the way she says it (too forced and fake), which is the same way she says ""did you feel the burn? I know I did!"". But I guess it's not that big of a deal, since you only deal with her for 10 minutes at a time."
4,Its worth it,"If you haven't been in the gym in 5 years (like me), its perfect to start somewhere. As it gets easier you can use arm and leg dumbbells. Its very basic. The dvd seems a bit old, sometimes it stops so i have to clean it. But she is motivating you, and show you how exactly do it, so after all totally worth $6."
3,"Good Dvd, but came used","I bought this dvd for my sisters birthday as a knick knack gift. She loved it but the fact that she brought it to me and said the disc was horribly dirty with spilled nail polish on it and a bunch of caked on dust didn't make me happy. Would have given it 5 stars but it came used and dirty. I didn't know it was used, they should mark that down =/"
4,Great for beginners,"The instructor is definitely not my favorite, but overall this workout is easy to follow and it's great if you're in a time crunch. What I like most about the 10 minute solution DVD's is that you can personalize your workout before you begin, which saves me a lot of the hassle I have with other workout DVD's where I have to go back to the menu and choose my next workout."
4,Just turn down the sound...,"I like having 10-minute sets of toning exercises to add on after my longer cardio workout. The exercises here are as challenging as you make them, but possible even for a beginner. The instructor, though, annoys the heck out of me! Too perky, seems almost condescending to me. After I learned thre basic routine, though, I was able to just turn down the sound and listen to something else while I worked."
2,10 minute solution,I really liked the way this video was set up. you can pick and choose wich body part you want to work but the exercises themselves were not very strenuous at all. I barley broke a sweat. I would recomnd this video for people with no workout experience or who want a very low intensity workout.
2,Definitely for beginners...No muscle afterburn... :-(,"I guess I should have noticed the title of this video...Target Toning for BEGINNERS.I was looking for a toning video that targeted different parts of the body in short, 10-minute segments; thus I discovered the 10 Minute Solutions series. This video is geared EXCLUSIVELY towards beginners. I am an intermediate/advanced exerciser, and this video didn't make me break a sweat.The only thing good about this video is that the exercises themselves are quite unique. You won't likely find these same routines on other videos. If you are looking to mix up yor routine, this video may assist you in that venture.I did not like the instructor. Her dialogue seemed so scripted and fake. She was overly peppy and, in my opinion, extrememly annoying."
1,Very Professional,"I have a collection of over 100 fitness DVDs and although I am not the fittest, I can highly recommend this DVD. The programme is thorough and she has excellent form and cueing. 10 mins on each body area is used to the max and no time is wasted with unnecessary explanations. The production is of high quality and she performs the exercises with no back-up crew. Excellent toning and sculpting DVD!"
5,GREAT,"love this video, short and sweet. Works well , but remember like all workouts it has to be paired with some cardio to see a difference. I have been using this video for months now and its just a great little workout"
5,Getting Fit,Cindy Whitmarsh makes toning enjoyable with her expertise and enthusiasm. She focuses on the basics while encouraging the beginner and giving tips for those who desire to increase the intensity. This is a great workout for limited space and equipment!
4,"Good, but needs better cues","I am someone who does moderate cardio most days, and I was looking for a way to start toning up without needing equipment. As a complete beginner to any kind of toning/ strength exercise, this dvd was perfect for me. Each section is a manageable lengths, and the exercises are simple enough for beginners. I was definitely sore the next day!The only thing I would change is that the instructor doesn't count the exercises. She will say hold something for 8 counts, or do part of the move for 2 counts, but then just tells you to go without doing the counts. This means you have to either watch her for the tempo, which is hard to do from some of the positions, or count on your own and hope you are close.The stretching portion is not very impressive, I tend to substitute some of my own stretches and just use the dvd as a guide for how long to hold them."
5,Great Product,I like the format of this disc because it allows the user to select what area to exercise. Each target area can be viewed separately by choosing at the beginning. The pace is good for a beginner or non beginner and the instructors voice is pleasant and encouraging. The moves are slow and intentional so I think this is good selection for people with problems with repetitive joint issues. You will need some props such as lite weights.
5,Good Price,"I bought this for My son's Corrolla.The price was the best I could find , the shipping was fast and they sent the right item."
2,too watery,"This conditioner is good in the fact that it doesn't have fragrances, parabens, etc. and is gentle for chemically sensitive, but it is very thin and watery for a conditioner. Desert Organics Fragrance Free is much thicker and better, but more expensive per oz. I guess I will be buying the more expensive one from now on."
1,Problems reading/writing to card,"I have been having constant problems with this product. Often, I get error messages trying to write or read from it. I don't recommend this product at all - I have put it on the shelf to collect dust."
1,Interact needs to stop this crap.,"these things, like all interact products, erase your saves. segahas a 4X VMU for cheaper, why not buy that? THAT won't screw up. the only thing interact ever did right was the dex drive, and they discontinued that."
1,This Memory Card Sux!,THIS MEMORY CARD SUX! IT ONLY SAVES ON THE FIRST SLOT AND SOME OF THE TIME IT DOESN'T SAVE AT ALL! DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM! IT WONT WORK! AND IT ONLY SAVES 200 BLOCKS ON MINE! I PAID $29.99 AND COULD OF PAID $9.99 FOR THE SAME THING. DON'T LET THE PRICE FOOL U!
2,Not as reliable as Sega's,"I bought this and it worked pretty well for a couple of months. Recently it has failed to save in several games, or worse. In some cases, it appears to save properly, but then apparently corrupts the entire page so 1/4 of the memory has to be deleted. When this happened with both MSR and PSO, I decided it was time to shell out for another VMU. After all, some of my save games are 20-30 hours of my time, and so its worth the price difference to make sure those are safe."
5,whadda deal I got,"bought these from Amazon in 2006 for 55 bux. feel like I stole them for that price. sound is great...I switch em back and forth between the laptop and TV. Came back to buy another set to avoid the switch game (though it's super simple) and see they are hundreds of bux now. won't spend that much, even for the Bose quality."
4,"Heavy clear base, weak highs",The other reviewers got it right on. The base is amazing for these little guys. There is actually too much base with relation to mid and high. But the base is clear and beautiful. Too bad there is no tone control. I paralleled a second speaker to bring out the highs and the combo sounds better. Still looking for that elusive 2 speaker system that has the right balance.
4,"Hey, It's a Computer Speaker","Considering most pc's come with a less than stellar speaker system to begin with, these are a blessing. My computer came with Kinyos which should tell the reader what I had to deal with -- no bass, limited treble, and mid range(?).I plugged these in and was blown away by the sound quality. Not as good as my Onkyo stereo system but, then again, I didn't pay $400 for these speakers.On the down side, the volume control is a wheel type instead of a protruding button which means one hand to turn the knob and another to balance the speaker while you do it.Got mine for $55 at Sam's Club. Take for granted it's discontinued since Bose.com no longer lists it."
2,"great looks, poor sound quality","Bose is well known for their super expensive stuff. These computer speakers are well built, and look great. But, like other Bose speakers, the bass is mediocre, the treble is blasting, and the midrange is non-existant. I can barily hear the vocals in music!!! They sounded so awful, that I thought the problem was with the I-Tunes software. But, weeks later, I have tried several audio players, and now know that it is the speakers that are the problem. But, I threw away the box, and I can't return them."
3,Just ok...,"My daughter loves to watch Meerkat Manor on animal planet. We thought she would play with them more than she does. Plus, they are small and we have already lost 2."
1,MEERCAT REVIEW,"I THINK THE MEERCATS ARE CUTE, ALTHOUGH, VERY OVER PRICED RE: THE MATERIALS USED TO MAKE THEM (PLASTIC). I WAS DISAPPOINTED TO SAY THE LEAST."
4,Deeply Felt and Highly Learned,"For a visceral thrill we can always count on Arnold--not Schwarzenegger in this case, but Arnold Weinstein, whose books combine a whole lot of learning with the human touch of passion and the starkness of memory. Arnold's dream of a scream loud enough to wake up an entire household clues us in immediately that he is a sensitive, caring man, with definite issues regarding boundaries. No wonder he then focusses on the famous Munch painting in which space and time are caught up and expressed in a soundless scream, a visceral pain of being that transcends the visual and becomes auditory, or not quite.Many professors have written reams about Munch's SCREAM, but few have managed to bring it into the mainstream of Western intellectual culture. As he did in his book about spaces and the heimlich, Weinstein constantly surprises and envigorates the tiredest old subjects, I can just imagine what he does to his students!"
3,Erudite but a bit too vague for my tastes,"Arnold Weinstein is a brilliant teacher/scholar at Brown University who addresses some very interesting ideas in this book. He displays his very broad grasp of both literature and cinema in presenting this book's themes. Unfortunately, the ideas he raises are presented in a manner that strikes me as overly rambling and lacking in clear definition. I found it somewhat interesting but unsatisfying. I found his lectures much more enjoyable."
3,British Invasion,"This particular group from Liverpool never did very well in the U.S., but was very popular in their native England. I was aware of them, and their wonderful song, ""Funny How A Love Can Be"" which for some reason I still hum and sing to myself to this day, and being the song is from the middle of the 1960s. This particular 2 CD set may be more for the avid collector, like myself, perhaps not so for the curious person not knowing the group. Overall, though very enjoyable for me, and I am happy with the purchase."
2,a very limited study,"Too many writers (and genres!) are overlooked in this ideologically-blinkered study.She ignores both poetry and Sephardic literature, especially Jewish writers of the Islamic world, and generally discredits writers whose sympathy for deterritorialization or universal justice exceeds the parameters Wisse establishes for Jewish particularity. A very ""tribalist"" approach to identity overall, which inevitably overlooks the subversive vigor of modern Jewish literature in important contexts."
2,Where's the workout,"I waited a long time for this box set to arrive and I was highly disappointed. I was looking forward to Pilates tapes using the original Joseph Pilates methods and knew that Romana would offer the most authentic tapes. She did deliver in that respect - the techniques are just what I was expecting. What's lacking is the actual workout. One tape offers a workout of 30 minutes. The rest are 15 min or less. I kept watching one tape after another thinking the real workout was just around the corner, but it never was.Bottom line - I do not recommend this box set. It's a waste of money. The tapes are repetative and are void of the real Pilates workout I was looking for. I sincerely wish I could give a better review."
2,Not Romana's High Standards,"Romana is surely one of the the most artful, colorful, and extraordinarily gifted of Joseph Pilates' students. But these videos don't show the greatness of Mr. Pilates' method, and I don't think Romana Kryzanowska would really approve of these videos herself. Some workouts don't show the correct exercise order, some demonstrators look uncertain and tentative, and Romana's wonderful spark of life is seldom revealed. Also, there is another person who actually does some of the off-screen verbal instruction. There is old film footage of Romana and Joseph Pilates, which is good to see. But, in general, these videos don't live up to Romana's high standards of excellence."
2,Unpolished,"I had never heard of Romana K. before my instructor told me about this well-known student of Joseph Pilates. My instructor studied with Romana for several years in New York City, and was certified by her. So I thought it might be good to buy this 4 video set. It was strange. There were several---actually many--- mistakes and uncertainties that made me believe they were actually rehearsing for a video. Some of the performers visibly caught themselves making mistakes. It was clear the performers did not know the order of some exercise sequences. The only reason I know the right order is because I take lessons.Romana may be the most revered teacher to study under Joseph Pilates, but these videos don't show it. I was kind of bummed out because I was expecting greatness."
2,Interesting But Not Great,"I bought this video set to have a record of traditional Pilates, and because the old film footage of Romana is good to see. By and large, though, this ""4 volume gift set"" is not the best gift.I've studied the Pilates method through both Peak Pilates and Stott Pilates training programs. Since I heard about Romana, I thought I would give this video set a try. The costumes were good, the lighting and sets were good. The demonstrators were accomplished, but something special was missing, that sparkle that Romana is known for revealing in her best students. But I didn't see enough of Romana teaching. Some person---who didn't seem to know Pilates very well---did the voiceover instruction.Since I by a lot of Pilates videos to learn new exercises, and to learn from different traditions within the Pilates method, I recommend ""Pilates for Dummies"" for beginners and ""Classical Pilates"" from beginner to advanced levels."
2,Many Fish In The Sea,"This DVD collection is alright, but I've seen others I like better. I began my teacher training through the Peak Pilates program, and I love the great benefits you can achieve from the method. Videos cannot replace private instruction, but some DVDs are good at explaining and demonstrating Pilates. If you are just beginning Pilates, you might want to try ""Pilates for Dummies."" This is definitely a good introduction. If you want a wide ranging menu of excellent mat workouts try ""Pilates Complete for Everyone."" If you want the most traditional Pilates with complete workouts showing basic-advanced workouts try ""Classical Pilates."""
3,a collectible only,"I am a classically trained Pilates instructor with over 6 years of teaching experience. In that time, I have seen very few dvd's that I would recommend over Brooke Siler's book. This is no exception, I am sorry to say. It's a great reference guide and certainly, you can get some in depth points on particular moves. However, to be repetative, this is more of a reference guide than any sort of a ""follow along"" workout."
2,very little instruction,"I was not impressed with this DVD set. I scanned each video and found it very difficult to follow along with the exercises when you have to keep twisting your head to look at the TV so you know where you are and what stage of the exercise you should be doing. The fast pace really wasn't the trouble, it was the lack of instruction. Truly, I think this could have been so much better by using cues, reminders (breathe, belly in, etc) and analogies to complement the workout. Actual teaching! For all the hype of how fabulous Romana is as an instructor, I was sorely let down with this production. It looks like she's great to work with in person, appearing to be a very kinesthetic (teaching/learning by feel & touch) instructor. But that's why others are involved in the production of these DVD's - to make sure the communication makes it across to the viewers. That's why I buy DVD's to workout with and not a book."
2,Forgive me if I am wrong,"But isn't Daria Pace, who wrote one of the good reviews, the granddaughter of Romana Kryzanowska and a teacher of Romana's Pilates?Truly, this DVD series leaves much to be desired. As anyone who bought the full collection knows, the beginning of each DVD is the same. The workouts are flawed in presentation - didn't they rehearse? - and lack the quality of instruction I expected from such a production. Considering that these DVDs feature Romana and some of the best Pilates practitioners in the world, it is a crying shame that they aren't any better than they are, and that Romana's own granddaughter has to deny her heritage to promote them."
2,Well...What Can I Say?,"I trained to be a certified instructor in the Physicalmind system of Pilates. Physicalmind is a farily new school within the history of the Pilates method. We tend to focus upon rehabilitation and have a strong physical therapy component. We also don't encourage rhythm and dynamics as much as the classical style.Most of us in Physicalmind have heard of Romana's renowned teaching style, which is much different than the way I was trained. Romana is famous for bringing life to Pilates movement with rhythm and energy. The reason whay I bought this 4 video set is to experience Romana's excellence and ways of teaching.Unfortunately, Romana does not teach very much. And there is no description of her influence upon Joseph Pilates' method. This 4 video set did not provide the tradition I was looking for."
3,Romana's Pilates:4 Vol Gift Set: too much of the same,"I own videos by Lynn Robinson, Mari Winsor, Hilary Burnett, Yvonne Lin, Moira Stott, and Tracy York & Michelle Dozois and books by Ellie Herman (Dummies) and Alan Menezes (The complete guide).I bought Romana's gift set expecting to get a lot of variety and to learn something new. So I was disappointed that all four started with the same footage (and advertising). They're OK, but they didn't meet my expectations compared to my other videos and books. In addition, I thought that the ""Optimum Weight Management"" title was misleading.I agree with the other reviewers' criticism. I teach mat classes through a local adult education agency, and my students often tell me how much they appreciate the constant reminders re: breathing, positioning, NTS, etc. This is another area in which the gift set falls short."
2,Not My Way,"I began my Stott Pilates training 6 months ago, and someone told me to get this 4 DVD set because it features the well-known Romana Kryzanowska. Since I never studied with Romana, I thought this 4 volume video set would help round out my Pilates training. Although I'm far from being an expert, I couldn't see the importance of this eminent Pilates instructor. There were moments when Romana was teaching, but she didn't teach enough to justify buying this 4 video set.People say that Romana teaches the classical approach to Pilates. These videos are definitely different than Stott Pilates, but I couldn't comprehend her supposed brilliance. She made me laugh (I used my Powerhouse) a couple of times when she was strict with a demonstrator.I'm sure that Romana is an excellent instructor, but the video didn't really express the specialness."
2,I expected it to be better,"I have read almost all of Erica Jong's earlier books, & I was looking forward to reading this one. Although in the beginning this novel seemed promising (Sarah's story is very lively & well told) later the book dragged on and on...Jong's central themes (women versus men, spirit versus day to day life) were better explored in her earlier works.It seems as if Erica Jong is, yet again, trying to say the same old things in the same old way. Maybe the ""same old things"" part isn't what's wrong: the ""same old way"" part definitely is. She's an intelligent writer, seems like an intelligent & very lively person (especially from Fear of Fifty, even though that too, was repetitive) so why can't she start writing something different? I mean, completely different, not just ""changing the names of the main characters"" different..."
3,Only Mindless Fun,"If you want something to read that is fun but not a work of art, I think you've found it. Jong keeps her reputation as a soft porn queen though, fyi. During passages of this grandmother telling her life story, she breaks into somewhat explicit descriptions -- which were seriously out of the grandmother's character. I found the whole book a bit contrived. You'll enjoy this book, but don't expect any new revelations."
4,The Past,"We are a composite of the collection of our past and in Inventing Memory by Erica Jong interweaves the lives of four generations of women.This story takes you to the turn of the last century to the early years of the twenty-first century.You discover the wonders and excitement of Paris with the glow and hardship of America. Filled with love, life, and a bit of lust, these strong women result from a strong stock.You will rejoice in taking the passage on learning about the past only to unlock the secrets of the present."
4,A good anthology of mother/daughter relationships,"Erica Jong captures the mother/daughter, love/hate relationship well. Her book appears to be more about not inventing memories, but how we all perceive our past differently, and how we are all a product of our ancestors. The whole mother/daughter relationship is not completely realized until the daughter becomes a mother herself. Her depiction of how a woman struggles to find her identity in a male society, and that she has to understand and be happy with herself before she can be happy with a man, continues to be a prevalent problem in our society."
2,The book got progresssively worse,"I loved the book at the start ,the story of the young emigrant sarah why oh why did she not stick with that instead of a boring saga of unbelivable generations of annoying women.did anyone else get sick of the consant literary references the author must think nobody on the planet has read Joyce or Oscar Wilde.Is that impressive to your readers I dont think so."
5,A Special Voice,Walter Jackson had one of the most distinctive voices I ever heard.He made it sound so easy until you tried to do what he did with a song.This is some serious kick back and listen stuff.
2,What happened?,"I have never completed this DVD. I have 3 other Jari Love DVDs that I love, but this program is not put together well and there is too much chit-chat."
3,Not so ripped,"This dvd is not nearly as good as Jari's other dvd's. She's very chatty and the stage and outfits are very distracting. I have loved every other ripped dvd. Not so much this one. You can still get a good workout, just not as fun."
2,Not That Great,"I LOVE Jari's DVD's - except this one, it's awful.There's little to no modification, the set is awful, and she outs her co-exercisers who sweat and thinks that's cute and/or funny. I turn the sound off during the warm up (same for both) because she is so annoying."
1,Extreme disapointment,"I am a big fan of Jari Love and her rip dvd's, I waited with such anticipation for this DVD Get Extremely Rip. I hate to do this to you Jari, but this dvd was absolutely terrible, the set-up of the exerciser's was totally disorganized, it would have been nice to see some of the exerciser's that we all know and recognize, although I did recognize Lori she was almost invisable in the back.There was no modifyer to help us through the workouts, my husband was very disappointed that he couldn't see the male exerciser's to help him. My overall opinion is this dvd is much of the same old same old with too many pulses that are bad on the knees this is one dvd that I will not be useing."
4,More Cardio Than Strength,"I LOVE Jari Love! And this DVD is a calorie burner, no doubt. But I don't think you will get extremely ripped from it...she moves quickly and has so many repetitions that you have to use a lower weight. Therefore, this is more of a cardio or endurance workout than a strength training DVD. You'll get toned, lean, but not ripped. If you want to get bigger muscles, or get toned faster, I would say stick to her classicGet Ripped! with Jari Love: Get Ripped 1000or perhaps her newJari Love: Get Extremely Ripped! 1000. Both are awesome (the latter is a bit fast-paced as well, but not as much).But I do appreciate the interval training! Like I said, certainly a calorie burner. Good luck getting through it. Oh yes, you will want a step. You can do it without one, but the exercises become way too easy."
3,Not as good as previous dvd,"I loved the first dvd I got from Jari Love. The ""Get Extremely Ripped!"" is good, but not as instructional as the previous dvd. It does; however, make you work hard."
4,A Blast of Nostalgia,"A terrific addition to those libraries of nostalgia whose music propels us back to a time that was simpler, or at least we thought it was. ""Beautiful People,"" ""Beg, Steal or Borrow,"" ""Circle"" and ""The Greatest Song I've Ever Heard;"" all those classic gems and more are in this stellar collection from what was one of the more underrated groups of its time. With their graceful harmony and lyrics that, if they're really listened to, simplify the emotions, the New Seekers give us a break from contemporary stresses, even just for a few minutes. ""The Greatest Song I've Ever Heard"" is more than a song title."
3,Had to fix it,"I ordered both the passenger and driver side mirrors. I received the package about three days before the estimated arrival date, which was nice. I just finished installing both mirrors. It was pretty easy, and they seem to work well so far.The reason I gave the mirror three stars was that the knob on the driver-side mirror wasn't attached well to the mirror assembly. I had to take three screws off the bottom and re-align the knob. It was an easy repair once I took apart the original mirror that I was replacing to see how it worked. Unfortunately, I had already installed the new one when I noticed it was broken, so I had to remove it, fix it, then replace it again. It added about an hour to the repair time. I was just glad that I didn't have to return it."
1,Honda mirror,"Sent me the wrong mirror, then wanted me to pay to send it back plus restocking fee. I e-mailed and they apologized and said they would send a mailing label. Never got it."
3,good aftermarket replacement,"This item fits like the original and looks a little shinier but that could be because the broken mirror is over 10 years old. The adjusting mechanism is not as good as factory[ the pivot came apart as I was installing]. I haven't tested it yet but I am afraid it will come apart again if the mirror is folded back. Overall, it works and was much cheaper than factory."
3,Dish Network SW21,"This switch is used with older Dish Network systems; the newer systems have the switch integrated into the LNBF. The switch is easy to replace and works just fine, although the life span seems to be somewhat limited. We have had problems with the old Dish system over the past two years. We were never able to determine whether the problem was with the older receivers or with the SW21 switch. If you have an older system and replacing the switch fixes your problems, good for you."
2,Not very big and I don't like the texture!,They don't seem to dry out my 10 week old yochon's skin but I definitely prefer the Earthbath All Natural Puppy wipes! I bought these online and because I couldn't wait I bought Earthbath's at Petco and decided to order another container of them through Amazon b/c there was shipping and was cheaper than what I paid at Petco..... I love EB's wipes! They are really big and the scent is so clean and not overpowering! I use them a couple times a day to get the pollen off of my puppy!! I have horrible allergies and these help me keep the pollen of my carpet and furniture!
2,"Not what i expected, THE GAME not included!","I LOVE the New England Patriots. When I saw this DVD come on the market, I knew I had to buy it. Nowhere in the advertisments did it clearly say...THE COMPLETE GAME IS NOT ON THIS DISC....I expected to see all 60 glorious minutes of the game, instead, this disc is just an edited highlight film. So, it doesn't capture the excitement of the game, it has been sanitized and packaged. I think the entire Superbowl portion of the disc is about 15 minutes. Its nice to have, but for those of you who wanted the entire game in DVD quality audio and video, this disc doesn't deliver."
1,SUPERBOWL XXXVI NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS CHAMPIONSHIP VIDEO,"I ordered this video as a gift for my brother. He's a die hard Patriots fan and I told him he would be getting it in the mail. I thought it would be the super bowl game in its entirety. He was at the game and I wanted him to have it. He said it was hi-lights of the season, not the game. I was very disappointed. He said it was okay, but it was not what I intended him to get."
3,This DVD misses wide right!,"While the Patriots season was one of the most memorable in sports history, this DVD is quite forgetable. It really does no justice to the unbelievable run made by these underdogs. Right from the beginning one wonders what the producers of this video were thinking. What does a ""knight in armor"" have to do with the Patriots? Was the cheesy voiceover in the beginning necessary? The Patriots season can speak for itself, it does not need cinematic bells and whistles to make it more interesting. This video continues to miss the mark by failing to elaborate on the Brady/Bledsoe issue. Was this not a major issue of the season? And how many of us felt the hair stick up on our arms, watching the Patriots come out as a team? Where was the coverage of this sidestory? As a diehard Pats fan I will hold on to this video as memory of the season, but this dvd definitely needs revision!"
1,"Not the superbowl, just a highlights reel...","very disappointing, and not what I was expecting at all. I was also surprised to receive my copy a full week ahead of it's release date. Maybe if they had waited a week longer, they could have put the game on the disc. The best way to describe this disc is the extras they should have put on a Super Bowl DVD, but no Super Bowl. Considering how expensive it was, and the fact that it's total run time is 1 hour, I found it to be a complete gyp."
4,Fun for a Pats fan,"This collection of highlights of the Patriots Super Bowl season allows fans to relive the greatest season in Pariots history. Some of the games get very little coverage, but I suppose NFL films didn't focus much on the Patriots early in the season. The footage of the Oakland playoff game, in the snow, is great, with some good looks at the field goals and the INCOMPLETE PASS.The video highlights are complimented by audio tapes from the Patriots radio braodcasts that are first rate. The DVD bonuses of Steve Grogan and Gino Cappaletti are also great for long-time Patriot fans. Even the U2 footage is excellent. As a Patriots fan, I enjoy this DVD each time I watch it."
4,The Patriots DID win the superbowl!,"A great piece of memorabilia to have if you're a Pats fan. I only wish they had some footage from the parade on there, where millions of fans waited hours on the coldest day of the year in Boston to cheer on the World Champions. If you enjoyed a few cocktails like I did, then this will help you ""remember"" all the important aspects of the SuperBowl."
3,***I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED***,"I expected more. For 65 minutes the season is highlighted, in 3 to 5 minute segments for each game. I was very entertained, but so disappointed because the Pats fantastic Super Bowl performance was only shown for 5 minutes! I really feel that the video has been advertised as having the ""whole superbowl."" Not just a segment. Also absent was the U2 half-time show. Overall, if you want to relive the '01 season, the tape is worth it, but just don't expect as much as I did!"
2,HIGHLIGHTS ONLY!!! Not whole SuperBowl XXXVI Game...,"I got mine...and watched it. Be aware that this DVD (possibly the VHS, as well) contains only the HIGHLIGHTS of Patriots Excellent Season. It does NOT contain the whole SuperBowl XXXVI game. Enjoy..."
1,I thought this would be the whole Superbowl?,"As an Australian, I only get to see one football game live a year. That happens to be the Superbowl. The best Superbowl that I have ever seen. I was excited to learn that the DVD of this game would come out and was expecting the whole game. Especially after it was confirmed the U2 halftime show was included as a special feature. I was very dissapointed when I found out it had a review of all the Pats games and only a few minutes on the SB. Although the NFL Films productions are good. I don't think it captured the excitement of the game itself. I hope someone has the sense to release the whole game on DVD."
1,Super Bowl XXVl-New England Patriots Championship Video {VHS},"Even though good quality tape, Where's the Superbowl XXVl, It only show highlights, of all the seasons choosen by saler, No no not a good idea for U2 was the halftime show."
2,Deceptive Advertising,"I was looking for a DVD of Superbowl XXXVI. The description of this DVD gave the impression that it contained the whole game. Instead, it gave a recap of the season with footage of numerous games and about 10 min. of the superbowl. This was not what I wanted and was very disappointing."
4,Fantastic Way To Remember The Patriots 2001 Season,"If you are a Patriots fan there is no way you cannot enjoy this DVD reliving the magical 2001 season, the ""Snow Game"", and Super Bowl XXXVI.The only problem I have with this DVD is it's too short -- every Super Bowl DVD after this one has hours of footage instead of just an hour but you will NOT be disappointed with what is on this disc!!**** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
1,Bogus DVD,"This DVD is so bogus, the Raiders should have won that playoff game, this title should be marked with an asterik!! Not only that, but N.E. ended up winning only because the Steelers and Rams had severe off days! Next season, you can use this DVD to re-record next year's Super Bowl, which will be minus the Patriots! Goodnight Beantown!"
1,Huge mistake to buy this,"I thought I would save a little money and buy this instead of the Epson product, huge mistake, never had trouble like this until used this product. Everything prints in light yellow and you cannot read it, finally discovered you can print in black but you have to go to print properties EVERY time and change to monochrome, is easy to forget that too and wastes paper. The only color it printed in was yellow. We could not take it off and throw away because the printer instructions say that if you remove the cartridge before the ""out of ink"" indicator comes on it will mess up the printer sensors so we had to suffer and endure thru using the ___ thing until it was used up. Tried to call their toll free number numerous times and always busy. I will never never buy any ink cartridge except Epson, this one was one of the biggest ... I have ever purchased."
4,Cute Costume,"The costume is by no means great quality, and could easily come apart if worn too much, but it does look adorable, and the fit was just right."
5,An invaluable resource for the amateur cartophile!,"I have not yet completed reading this book, but I've skimmed through many parts and done a thorough reading of little bits of it. It has a solid -- if not particularly rich, in terms of details (if it did, the book would be thousands of pages long) -- history, along with many pictures of the projections (a bit austere: just the graticules and the outlines of the boundaries between water and land are shown, but then, that's all that's really needed). It has many useful mathematical formulas for translating latitude-longitude coordinates on the Earth into x-y coordinate on maps of various projections. If you're into map projections, here's where to start. (or, at least that's where I'm starting, and I have no complaints yet!)"
4,No complains,"i have an 2010 R6, stock with only a K&N air filter and now this Hotbodies megaphone. My sole purpose was to get it a little more louder for safety reasons (and this was the cheapest). Generally it is just a piece of Alluminuim pipe! it sounds stock at idle speed but once you're up to about 2k RPM and over it serves its purpose and gets the attention needed. BTW, easy installation - no manuals etc sent, just research on google,lol. also i removed my exup cables direct from the servo motor and this is my first bike, first install, very easy!!!"
4,Nice lacrosse for the money,"I bought this goal for my son's birthday. We received it in 4 days using super saver shipping! It was easy to assemble and fairly good quality for the price. We ended up using ty-raps to secure net to post because the supplied Velcro straps didn't hold it tight. But over all, it was no big deal. I would recommend it for anyone that is looking for a low cost, backyard lacrosse goal!"
2,Super-hero walkie talkies aren't all that great,"We bought the Human Torch and Bat-man. Human torch didn't work right out of the box. We had the old spiderman by himself which ended up working with the Batman. He worked. My 4 year old and I could barely hear eachother. I didn't expect it to be great, but I wouldn't recommend these toys. Spend $[...] and get some real ones and see how they work."
2,"Fun to make, but not to drink","Got this kit as a gift. Though making the root beer is kinda cool & fun, it doesn't taste very good. I followed the instructions to the letter, and though the first batch was probably a little over-carbonized, the second batch definitely was not. Both batches don't have all that much flavor, and had an unpleasant aftertaste.I really wanted to like this stuff, but it's just not enjoyable to drink. I'll be sticking with the really good ""microbrew"" root beers on the market, like Saranac or Boylan's."
1,Poor product,"I tried to get assistance from the manufacturer, but they never offered to replace the product. The product was done in 24hrs, tasted like turned cider, no aroma..I retraced my steps..I did it correctly..the manufacturer was no help at all.This was not my first time making root beer..but it will be the last time I use this manufacturer."
3,Its ok,"Cute concept, but a cheap looking product. Was slightly embarrassed to give it as a gift, but had no other ideas."
3,Fun to make,"I ordered this product because my boys wanted to make root beer. I placed the order and it arrived within a short amount of time. My boys and I went ahead and made it. The instructions were a bit confusing for them and it took me a couple times to read it to make the product. We followed the instructions to the letter. My boys were so excited about drinking it and only waited the one day to drink the first bottle. I tried it and didn't like it much. My boys enjoyed it as it had a strong taste and as they put it, ""it tastes like real beer"". They drank a second bottle almost two weeks later and it still has the very strong taste. I guess my expectations were that it would taste like the commercial, store bought root beer. But my boys loved it and I used it as a learning process about home brewing."
3,Rootbeer or an Experiment?,"I bought this product for my kids. it takes a few days for the batch to ferment. I would suggest it only for when the kids are not in school. It is neat for them to learn how rootbeer is made, but most kids (like mine) would prefer just the store bought type."
2,"had to return, couldnt give as a gift",When this came and I opened it my immediate thought was that the person I was sending it to as a gift would think it was total junk. I think that sums it up.
5,Tastes Like It's From The Soda Fountain,"This was my first time ever making root beer. It's so good! It tastes like it's from a soda fountain, except stronger. Everyone in my house loved it. It can be a little time consuming, but good things usually are."
1,booooo,I have had this eq for a while and quite frankly I stopped using it almost as soon as I installed it. Its just poor quality and just wasnt working for what I needed it to do. it says 12 band but in essence its not coz its got front and rear. It just does not work.
5,LOVE the smell,"Can't believe how great this smells on me, get so many compliments especially from young women 30 years younger than me, and that is unusual"
4,Nice shoe.....Runs a little small,These shoes are very nice. They run a little small though. The quality and color of the suede are awesome. Very intricate detailing the circular design. Good purchase.
5,Practical Guide all Marketing Managers should have,Excellent presentation on practical ways pricing can help generate profits. Provides quantitiative evidence that some popular pricing schemes are not always good for the bottom line. Marketing managers in these hotly contested industries tend to get caught up in the seemingly easy answer by competing with price. This book highlights that folly and shows how they can turn pricing policy into a real value creator.
1,Spiru-Tein Bars - Strawberry Yogurt,"The Spiru-Tein Bars - [Strawberry Yogurt Flavor] lack any real flavor. We purchased them because the Spirutein Meal Replacement Shakes are so good and nutritional. However the taste of the Bars are so poor, that they are not worth purchasing again. We have been eating Meal Replacement Bars for a quick lunch during the work week for about 20 years, and of all the Bars we have tried, this one was the worst."
5,"Churchy, Churchy, Churchy","This CD is GREAT. It is pretty traditional, but it directs your spirit to God. My favorites are: ""He'll Give You Everything"", ""Praise Him"", ""The Water I Give"", ""Thank You"",""till Running"", and many more. I'm only 16 years old, and I love it."
3,Could be softer,These gummi bears were a little tough for my taste. I would prefer my gummi bears to be a little softer. Not bad though.
2,This Book Has No Ending,"Jihad was a long book, and when you get to page 415, Coonts suddenly cuts the story off and you never know how it turns out. It's as if he finally just got tired of writing it, or he came up against a deadline, and just created a quick 2 page ending which leaves you hanging. It pissed me off that I spent all that time reading, and then there was no real satisfactory ending.Also, the story has too much ""telling"" as opposed to ""discovery."" I felt like I was getting the story second hand, as opposed to being there watching the story unfold in person. Good writers know not to do that, and it should have been a red flag when I noticed it at the beginning of the book, but I kept reading anyway.This was my first (and last) Stephen Coonts book."
2,review,"Having read other books by Mr. Koonts, I find it hard to believe he had much to do with the writing of this one. The style seems quite unlike him. The chapters are each just a few pages long. It did not hold my interest."
4,Thriller,"This book is over rated based on the cover reviews. I have read better books by this author, but I still like his writing style. The book does not get interesting until neat the end."
2,BLANCHE TRIUMPHANT,"The two stars belong to Blanche. She is a quirky, vibrant character, very well-developed. I would like to read a non-mystery about Blanche in a non-me-against-them setting.The book, though short, is slow to develop; it's half over before anything happens. With the exception of a young man suffering from Down's Syndrome, all of the white people in the book are despicable. Though Blanche has phone conversations with her friends and family, the people physically present are caricatures of various degrees of evil ranging from worthless to monstrous. We are stuck with a lot of one-dimensional characters and no action to distract us. I found the plot centering around the rich old aunt quite unbelievable.Ms. Neely is a very good writer. I think Blanche needs wings to fly out of the constricting mystery-whodunnit category."
2,Well...Not What I was expecting from Volume 1,I was expecting like the the early shows...but instead we get the 2nd group of women. the slightly generic rip offs of the original girls. I guess I should have bought the DVD that came out awhile ago with MATILDA on the Cover...This is Like One Episode... the Video is fine... but for Volume 1 I was expecting the original Glow.
4,IT BROUGHT MAKE SO MANY MEMORIES!,I loved this G.L.O.W DVD and I can't wait for volume 4 of the best of G.L.O.W!!! If your truly a G.L.O.W fan like me your going to want this DVD and more!!!

1,dvd Shake Rattle and ROLL,"DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM VERY POOR QUALITY AND AMATEURISHIF YOU LIKE PINUP GIRLS IN A CAR VID BUY ITShake, Rattle and RollI WILL RETURN MY PURCHASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,No Good,"I got the DVD and it is scratched and dosent play. I got it to play for 5min and it looked like a good movie, too bad the whole movie dosent work."
2,Unnecessarily difficult to read and not sure its worth it,"This book looks as if it went to publishing without editing. I have read a lot psychology and find the subject interesting. I am educated - professional engineer and attorney. I usually understand what I am reading. But this book forced me to re-read sentences and paragraphs because I could not understand what the authors were saying. Often I just moved on. Either the authors were not sure themselves or I just couldn't get it. But two things were clear, the book is written almost exclusively in the passive voice with high-sounding amorphous words that seem to be intended to leave you either in awe or just completely frustrated. It reads like a first draft that went straight to publishing. My wife found reading it painful at best and she never made it through. The authors also seemed little concerned about citing their authority. Do they just make this stuff up? I felt the advice was unreliable."
1,"not a physician, not a minister.....why take his advice?","For those who know nothing about Gary Ezzo - just google his name.He is not a physician (does not have any degree in any science or healthcare profession), and he's not a minister, has no degree in divinity or theology, either. Plus - he's been excommunicated from his church AND denounced by the AMA/AAP.I certainly wouldn't take advice from someone who is as uneducated as he is.I have no idea why some folks seem so radical in their support for him.Brainwashing?"
3,Beware of religious undertones,The theory proposed is a sensible one but beware of religious undertones. The author's have been publically scrutinized for using a religious rather than a medical basis for many of their claims.
2,"ok, but not specific enough","I have a 2 year old and I have read this book twice to try and get things down. I like the concepts, but I found the book confusing, and although I appreciate that they try to keep things open minded, I needed something a little bit more specific.Lately my 2 year old and i have been butting heads and after combining this book with tracy hogg's book, ""baby whisperer for toddlers"" I think we are finally beging to understand each other, I am learing to be a better parent and she is learning more self control without feeling like she is being controlled.I am glad that I read the book, but I wish I had bought them both at the same time, instead of trying to figure out the toddlerwise book all by itself."
5,Good Parenting Advice,"We did Baby Wise with our child and Toddler Wise with her as well. Also doing Growing Kids God's Way at our church with the same authors and we are very pleased. Our daughter is your normal toddler but listens well, is learning obedience and that she is not the center of the universe. The goal of the authors is Biblical training and by looking at our society you can tell that is no longer a priority in the homes."
3,Not a great transition from Baby Wise,"I was a huge fan of On Becoming Baby Wise. I figured this book would help me implement some of the same helpful techniques with my toddler. While giving generally good advice, I didn't find it nearly as helpful as Baby Wise."
3,Toddler Wise Book,"The Baby Wise book was very helpful to us so we bought the Toddler Wise. We were hoping to get the same helpful advice that we got from the first book. This book didn't provide, at least not for us with our daughter. But we are reading the Child Wise book and found that to be more insightful. We could have skipped this book and go onto the Child Wise book without really missing anything here."
1,Ezzo Fraud,"I relied on Babywise like the Bible, and I bought Babywise II. But after finding so many errors that were literally at the elementary writing skills level, I looked up the publisher to contact them and offer my proofreading resume. Then I found out that it is self-published because no real publishing company will work with Ezzo because of his medical errors and personal legal problems. Check this out if you're considering anything by Gary Ezzo, then make your own decision. :[...] After reading this, it's kind of scary that this whole parenting series is such a big seller."
1,UGH - nails on a chalkboard,I lived by Babywise and still recommend it to others in my Multiple Moms group. This one is lame. I dont know what else to say about it other than it is as if they are searching for something to say and really have NOTHING to offer. A total disappointment. I got so much out of the scheduling suggestions in Babywise that I was really looking forward to some input (or even affirmation ..) ... so irritating to have high expectations. And I am sorry that I bought the others too... maybe I will get something out of the Potty version. I am much better off with What to Expect in the First Years and / + the Toddler Years version. And Dr. Sears BabyBook. The toddler version of Girlfriends Guide was really really helpful and hilarious read too. Also a new title Twin Set is very good for toddler twins.
1,"Loved Babywise, but didn't like Toddlerwise","I am still blown away by people's negative comments about Babywise. It is a guide to use to help your baby establish a routine and sleep through the night. It worked like a charm for our son, who slept through the night at about 2 months old. There were no failure to thrive issues or eating issues. Now that he is 18 months old, we are entering the fun toddler years with tantrums, not listening, etc. and I wanted something to help with some of these situations. I bought Toddlerwise, even though alot of people said it was useless (because I just loved Babywise). I wanted to see for myself. Well, they were right. There was alot of theory, psychology, etc, but no useful solutions to common problems. What I am looking for is a description of a behavior and then ways to counteract it. I may update this post when I find this book."
3,"Good, but not great","I LOVED Babywise and feel that it really helped my husband and I get our daughter off to a great start. She was/is an easy baby, sleeps through the night (since about 8 weeks), eats well, etc.Babywise II and Toddlerwise seem a little bit more geared to the stay-at-home mom/dad rather than the family with both parents working out of the house. There certainly was useful information in it (both of them...), but I was left feeling like I needed more info on how to handle my daughter as she becomes a toddler.All-in-all a good book, but it might suit some families better than others."
2,Meh,The other books (becoming babywise and pre-toddler wise) were both better and well written. I won't even waste my money purchasing the others.
1,Please don't do this to your children.,Ezzo is a crazy person who seems to consider children to be an inconvenience to be dealt with rather than innocent human beings who only want to be loved and cared for. No wonder his own children don't speak to him.
1,"Run, run run away from this book","This book advocates abusive parental behavior. If ever a book needed to be burned, this is it. I pity any child being raised according to Ezzo's advice."
1,Stay Away,"these books are dangerous--they seduce parents into a terrible mindset that can endanger their lifelong relationships with their children. Think about it: why would a kid who was treated in such a punitive manner ever willingly confide in those same parents when a teenager? Also, don't buy the religious justifications for this theory--it's totally fraudulent."
1,Read what the AAP and other experts say about Ezzo,"This book and others by Ezzo are nothing more than one uneducated (Ezzo has no background in child development or medicine) and over-opinionated person's views on raising children. Ezzo views children as a parent's PROPERTY rather than RESPONSIBILITY. As I read the book I noted many areas where it was obvious that Ezzo was overemphasizing his own pet peeves.Most of the parents I know who support these parenting methods are over-eager for a ""show-child"" that perfoms for the parents. They want there 3-year-old playing piano, etc. Most of them put their children in every group activity available, anything that gets the parent attention.I caution parents to consider the long term results. In the short term you get a robotic, subserviant child. In the long run you get what Ezzo himself got, grown children who want no part of their parents' lives."
1,right wing nut with no actual information,"I'm amazed that this book even got published. What upsets me most is that it got published without any warnings on the jacket. It needs to clearly state, ""Must be a fanatical Christian to see this book as useful."" As I read it I felt similar to the pilot assaulted by H.C.'s in the movie Airplane. I couldn't figure out if I was being given advice about raising my child or brainwashed into drinking poisoned lemonade. In conclusion, this book sucked - do not waste a moment of your life reading it."
3,it's ok,Was hoping to get some more practical tips and examples but all in all it was fairly good info and some new ideas to try out.
5,Another good read,"This book is a great help and recommended to have when applying the Babywise book, starting with the first book in the series. It is informative & helpful."
5,Skeptic turned to fan,"I have to admit that I very nearly didn't buy this book. I found Babywise to be overly harsh, or at least it seemed to be at the time. I bought Toddlerwise, however, and was really impressed. First of all, let me say that my son is exactly two years old. With that in mind, he is at the middle to older end of the Toddlerwise spectrum. The thing is, as a parent, I was doing a lot of what Toddlerwise recommends before I bought the book. The book just filled in some BIG gaps for me. The first time I tried roomtime my son ""read"" to himself in his room for 20 minutes while I actually cleaned one of our bathrooms without once having to ""yell"" at him to stay away from the cleaning supplies. Also looking him in the eye when correcting him and expecting a response really helps us both. He is learning and I feel like I am actually getting through. I couldn't be more pleased!"
5,"If you knock it, you probably haven't tried it.","It seems to me, that most people with strong negative opinions about Ezzo's books have never given them a real try. The only people I know who don't like these concepts, haven't even ever used them. That's pretty ignorant. These books especially Toddlerwise are wonderful. No abusive, restrictive, or any of that garbage people say. If you actually read the entire books, you will see that the goal is quite the opposite. The goal is to be loving, kind, nurting while teaching your children skills that will set them up for success. It is not to have super control over them. Young children need firm boundaries for their safety as well as healthy development. Utimately they will have greater freedom. In other words, read the books before you trash them. They have helped a lot of helpless parents. Thanks!"
5,Great book,"Used it with two children and love it! As with any parenting book, take what you want and leave the rest. Use common sense, etc. Also used Babywise. Both of my children (now 4 and 6) are 100% healthy (since birth) and happy! I get compliments all the time from my babysitters that they love to babysit my children!Just read it yourself from page one to the end. Then decide."
4,follow-up falls a tad short of debut,"great effort weakened only by tracks 3rd and 8th tracks. if only longer ""back where you belong "" big hit potential.other sleepers spellbinder,lonely children.double vision is rock candy to the ears !"
3,This DVD gives you the overall on the Vatican but the quality isn't very good.,I gave this to my husband and we enjoyed it but the quality of the film wasn't what I had hoped for.
2,hard hitting grooves,"I thought it would be about the game more,and the players.Also thought that it would have some of the most hard hitting tackles every caught on film!!(If it did i would have gave it 5stars)As i am a x-football player i would like to see some hard hitting tackles!!"
1,Garbage,"Won't run on Windows XP, even with the patch, & in compatability mode. NO support from ScanSoft. I'd give it negative stars if I could."
1,Very strange,This is clearly not what I would choose to listen to for relaxation. It is not calming to the mind or ear.
4,A Hip Book,"Reverend Knight is a pastor in Harlem and a father of 12 boys. In a search to solve the mystery of his sons' torn-up shoes he hires nanny Sunday. Nanny Sunday is taken on a dancing adventure when she discovers their secret!This modern day twist of the German folktale, ""The Twelve Dancing Princesses"", is fun and exciting. Elements of jazz and regee are mixed up into both the writing and the illustrations. Told through the family dog, you will want to get up and dance after reading this picture."
2,Its for a good cause.,This CD is for a great cause but i must admit these skits in any other town for a morning radio show would not cut it. They only survive because they are in a Navy town and nothing else to compete against. But buy it for the cause. You can never go wrong helping someone in need for the holidays and then just throw it in the trash where it belongs.
4,good sequence,"This is a good intermediate yoga routine for a flow series. I wish it included a bit more back bend poses, and spent a tiny bit more time on each pose. Of course it is advertised as vinyasa, so I understand why the poses aren't held for long. The setting is lovely, and the music unobtrusive. I particularly like that you see Elise doing the series of poses without editing - that is when she makes a slight balance error, it isn't spliced out."
4,Relief for the tush!,"I bought this, not for my wheelchair but for my work chair.It holds up very well and provided a relief almost instantlyfor my back and tush. I would give it five stars but I thinkthe gel version may be even better.After three months, I couldn't be more pleased."
5,Refreshing realism in language,"As an English teacher, I found the book to be refreshingly authentic. The use of the vernacular of the time is terrific. The stories are a little outrageous, but Mr. Bell was an author and a delightful wordsmith. I loved this book."
2,This is not a softcover edition of Exalted,"This is not a softcover edition of Exalted. This is a novel setin the same universe as the RPG Exalted. The main rule-bookfor Exalted is currently availble in two hardcover editions, the Limited and the Unlimited.The Unlimited is the only edition currently available on Amazon; I believe the Limited is out of print.This book should not be listed as a ""softcover edition"" of Exalted, but as an independent title."
1,The Seller of the Samson Washer,"I was excited thinking that Samsom had made a larger unit. NOT. This ""12.8"" Liter washer is the same washer available for $50 less at a dealer that advertises the actual model number GBW300. I just got finished filling my GBW300 with 12.8 liters of water to make sure I'm not blowing smoke. If they'd have put that it was the GBW300 in bold letters along side of it I wouldn't be making a comment. However they also changed the measurements from inches to mm which even obfuscate the issue more. By the way, this is an awesome machine. I live in Guatemala where they have amoeba;s as house pets and at the moment I'm drinking a raw green smoothie of which I'd washed the veggies in the Samsom and not had to use other chemicals. My understanding is that the ultra sonic also knocks the pesticides off the leaves as well. If I don't get cancer in 15 years we'll know for sure :-)"
4,A snapshot from the past,"'Canal Boat Children' is a remarkable study made in the 1930's surveying the children who lived on the canal boats in Ohio, Pa, and NY. It makes you think about the advantages our current school system provides children. For the most part these children had no formal education. It also makes you appreciate how hard people (children as well as adults) worked in the 19th century. Although written at the end of the canal boat era, the booklet gives you the sense of life on the canals from their inception. This is not a long document, and can easily be read in an evening. It includes interesting photographs."
3,Good Book,I enjoyed the Crisscross Shadow and would rate it somewhere in the middle as far as a set is concerned. It was neither among the best nor worst of the series.
3,The Crisscross Shadow,"I think this book was nice, especially for the action parts like getting klidnapped, the train incidient, and the cliff part. Those are mostly the only things I like about this book. But it's still a classic, no matter how many stars it has. That's a fact."
4,Nice Vintage Reissue,"My Small Stone doesn't look like the one pictured, but I'm going to assume that the guts are similar, as both feature the same controls. Mine was made in Russia, housed in a similar olive drab box to my Big Muff. Controls are pretty simple, a Rate knob and the color switch. With the color switch in the down position, the phaser gives off that great vintage tone. Flip it up, and it's a little crazier, still very controllable. One thing to keep in mind is that this pedal tends to dampen your output a little. You may need a volume pedal to compensate. A very nice, reasonably priced vintage reissue."
1,Unbound by Halston for Men,"I was very upset when I saw the size of it for the price. I had ordered this cologne from another company but the 3.3 oz for less then what I paid with Amazon. My husband only wears this cologne and we can longer find it in stores, so we have to purchase it online. I will be purchasing it from the other company in the future."
3,Driver's mirror Chevy Monte Carlo,"The mirror arrived quickly and intact. It fits the car perfectly. However, mine is a little curved which distorts the image and is frustrating to view. This means a lot of second looks and checking just in case. Not a great mirror, not a good mirror, only just barely a mirror..."
5,liked on the website but......................,very good love itwill have to buy a new one soon tho (cd collection growning to fast)
5,My CD Tank,"I refer to this product as my tank. It is durable and looks great. As you might expect, it has some weight to it, but not unreasonably heavy. It looks good inside and out and if you actually buy CDs this is a must have investment to protect your CDs."
2,Romana's Current Pilates,"I studied with Romana Kryzanowska for many years during the 1970s and 1980s. This video is clearly not an adequate representation of Romana's phenomenal capacity to inspire students with passion and heightened expertise to accomplish excellence within Joseph Pilates' method. In real life, Romana is wonderful in so many ways, but this video does not bring her gifted approach to the audience. There is not a great deal of teaching, actually.It must be very difficult to capture the magic and charisma of anyone, but I think Romana is a person worthy of the best production efforts. What happened. Yes, the old film footage of Romana and Joseph Pilates is interesting, but I don't think Romana's stellar presence is shown on this video."
3,Not the best as a workout but inspirational,"The documentary about Joseph Pilates and Interviews with Romana are very inspirational and even funny a little bit, that really makes you wanna practice after you saw what an 80 year old woman can do, but the workouts aren't the best, it has a longer workout with romana at a slower pace and explantions which aren't the best and exersices aren't peformed at both sides so it's not fun to workout with it. The full 15 minute workout without romana is very fast paced and had very little repetitions to each exercise , there are some exercises you don't see often in pilates videos, like the snake and some transitions , there also a bonus standing warmup against a wall which reminded me of ballet and didn't seem good for the knees."
2,Not What It Could Be,"For over thirty years I've taken lessons from Romana's students, and sometimes from Romana herself. I've often watched Romana teach. She is a wonderful person. This video unfortunately does not live up to Romana's greatness. What's strange is that Romana only teaches a little bit. So, it's really not an instructional video. In addition, the exercise titles, which cover the entire screen, interrupt the exercises themselves so it's hard to feel a sense of flow. The demonstrators look great but there are some obvious mistakes recorded on video."
2,Oh Well...,"This video has good old timey footage of Joseph Pilates teaching Romana. They are both very inspiring. This archival film is probably the best part of the video, because the workouts seemed under practiced. The workouts didn't flow smoothly and strongly with confidence and style. I felt inspired to continue my Pilates practice, but I wasn't sufficiently instructed about what I should do or feel during the exercises.Although inspiration is definitely a very good quality, I thought I would be taught the Pilates method more thoroughly. For instruction, I would recommend some of the other Pilates videos on Amazon."
3,So-so,This video is a good tool for the experienced Pilates practitioner. Beginners need more explanation. Romana gives good cues and explains what some of the exercises are designed for. I especially like the documentary section.
3,ok but not great,"This book has some good thoughts, some points that could be meditated upon but it doesn't really appeal to people of an advanced christian experience. it is more for people who are perhaps newer in their walk or who are not apt to read or study deeply. The book unfortunately doesn't encourage the reader to think deeply or to study things further. it appears to be superficial in its presentation."
3,too complicated to set the alarm; radio volume in bad place,"Excellent clarity on the phone and radio. Has volume control for phone. Volume control on radio/alarm is in a very bad location. Reach over and turn the clock where you can see it and you have inadvertanly turned the volume all the way down. That is a real problem come morning. While this is a first rate phone and radio, I have a problem with having to push so many buttons to set the alarm. To reset the alarm for the next day, you must turn off the alarm and then remember to turn it back on for the next day. Alarm A is radio; alarm B is buzzer."
1,Radio & display died after only 18 months,"I have not liked this unit since I bought it 18 months ago. The programming is not intuitive at all. Secondly, the snooze and alarm buttons are difficult to find if the unit is on the left side of the bed. Also, by the size of the display you'd think it would be easy to read. However I cannot see it from my bed--a foot away--let alone across the room. A black display with lighted letters/numerals would be better. Then yesterday I unplugged the phone as instructed to replace the 9V backup battery. When I plugged it back in, the light came on but there is no display. The radio won't work and neither will the alarm. All I have left is a phone. I bought this unit for the combination of features/price but I guess you get what you pay for!"
1,Clock radio/telephone,"I received product fine. The radio part of unit would be loud & if touched unit it would go silent, till touched somewhere on it or shook. The phone worked fine. The dial couldn't be seen unless right on top of it, even in bed, had to raise up to see. I had a GE that had a blk screen & the no.'s could be seen across the room. I guess I got a defective unit. When I emailed sender, he told me not to send bk/refunded my money. I gave to good will."
2,Heavy-handed and muddled,"I have liked Lackey's other books, but this one just seemed ponderous. A typical girl-runs-away-from-home-has-to-survive-despite-hardships kind of book. What was especially annoying to me was how Rune kept ""noticing"" the hypocritical way the church conducted itself, and how all they really cared about was money. The book might have been saved for all that, but when Rune finally gets to the Free Bards, away from the oppression of the Church and Bardic Guild, she, and her new-found love, the leader of the Free Bards, seem to completely abandon their earlier characters. Lackey sums the ""romance"" up very neatly, not even bothering to take time for explaining developments in the relationship. And once Rune and Master Wren do have sex, they immediately ""need to be married."" Did Lackey just get tired of the book at the end? I just hope she had some other more interesting project to get to, because I would not read another book like this one."
5,Great book with both good storyline and likeable characters.,"What do you do if you are a girl with music in your soul in a land where only men can be musicians? If your name is Rune, you outfiddle a ghost, disguise yourself as a boy, learn music from a bookseller -- and when you are beaten by the Musicians' Guild you find a way to go on. Lackey's _The Lark and the Wren_ is filled with magic, high adventure, action and romance. In her Alanda universe, Lackey (best known for her Valdemar series) creates a world filled with people that fans of fantasy will want to visit frequently. Highly recommeded for all serious fanstasy readers."
4,** The story of a bardic heroine **,"This is the story of a struggling young woman who started out with nothing. An immoral mother, and hateful ridicule from the village. I strongly admire the character Mercedes Lackey built up in Rune. She does an excellent job of pulling all of the details in a persons being together-strengths and faults- and created an almost tangable character. This book was also interesting because of the knowledge and beauty of music that was intertwined. Truly a symphony of character and fantasy!"
4,Two books in one,"This is a long, complex story which the author could have split into two books. The first part of the novel introduces Rune (the Lark), the ... daughter of an innkeeper's second wife, who escapes from the inn to become a traveling musician and to try her luck at gaining admission to the Bardic Guild. A series of adventures brings her to an ill-fated trial with the Guild and her introduction to the Free Bards. Part of this was published separately as a short story. The second part of the novel deals with the Free Bards, and travels with Talaysen (Master Wren) as a free bard. Additional characters are gradually introduced including a new apprentice with an unexpected background. The novel is the first in the series about the Free Bards, and sets the stage at the end for the following novel. It is helpful to read the series of novels in the order written as characters from one novel reappear in following novels."
5,I may be impartial...,"... because I have read this book before and knew I liked it. I love the whole Bardic Voices series. Eight years after I read them the first time I found myself wanting to re-read them (not something I do often) Not to post a spoiler but the gist is a young girl who dreams of changing her situation, and the crazy tale of how she winds up doing so. If you are not sure you want to spend money on it, get book 1 from a library and you'll know from that if you want to own it, or read the others. You can also save some money and buy the trilogy all togetherThe Free Bards (Bardic Voices)But there is another book that is not necessary, but goes in between the second and third bookA Cast of Corbies (Bardic Choices)"
1,Sesame Street is more stimulating.,"This is without a doubt one of the worst books I have ever read. How anyone can think this is good is beyond me. For those skeptics out there I give you an example of Lackey's ""fine"" prose: ""He didn't understand half of what she said to him, sometimes."" (page 20) And that's just one example out of literally thousands. Infantile and just plain bad."
1,Hard to use. Try SLIMP3.,"I bought and tried out one of these devices to access the sizable MP3 collection on my computer. Alas, it's really hard to set up and slow to use.I much prefer my SLIMP3 from Slim Devices. It's a little more money, but it is tiny, has a bright and beautiful display, incredibly powerful music management software (free and open source!) and is so easy to set up and use. My wife loves it and would touch the HP product. You can build custom playlists from the remote or any web browser and the support is great! Oh, and it works on Windows 98,ME,NT,2000,XP, Mac OS X, Linux, BSD and Solaris!Of course, the SLIMP3 is a music-focused device, so it doesn't use your TV and can't display JPEG images, but that's what I have a laptop for."

3,won't pair with many headsets,"It pairs with my motorola s stereo headset but will not pair with my plantronics mono 520 or a soyo headset that both work fine with my cell phone. JAbra should be a little more clear about what types of headsets this will work with.UPDATEI received this message from JAbra:The Jabra A120s Bluetooth stereo adapter is not compatible with mono (non-A2DP) headsets. The A120s has only A2DP, so the receiving headset also has to have the A2DP. The receiving headset can have other audio profiles, like HSP and HFP as well. Most A2DP headsets are stereo (2 speakers), except for the Jabra BT8040, which has both stereo channels going into one speaker."
4,"Good Range, Long Charge Time","This little device works nicely with my bluetooth earphones and I can get a good 30 feet away from it before it drops out. My only quibble is that the charging method is USB only which means that I have to have a PC available to charge it. Since that can take up to seven hours, that's alot of wattage to burn just to charge up a toy. Fortunately, I have an Apple USB AC adapter that accepts the Jabra USB cord, so I can just plug it into a wall without having to fire up my desktop or notebook.Other than that, I've got no problems with this little box. It works as advertised and allows me to use many audio devices with Bluetooth headphones. If you've got a USB AC adapter, or plan to run your PC for several hours (most of us do anyway), you'll love this device."
3,Misleading sales pitch,"This device is excellent, and would have got five stars if it had been labeled correctly. It is claimed to be AVRCP compliant, it is not totally true. This would enable it to pause/fast forward/rewind/skip forward/skip back using my Motorolla S805's. It sadly does not, only mutes. In my opinion it does not do as advertised, basically it is a A2DP transmitter.The range is reasonable, and will not function when my garage door is closed and I am outside. It didn't come with the velcro to attach it to the MP3 either, not a big deal but more annoying than anything else.I will search again for the AVRCP transmitter as I can control my MP3 on my car stereo as well as my headphones too.Don't take this the wrong way, it is excellent and does a fine job, it is not totally honest as stated with its abilities."
3,Good product,"Good product. Once you get it the unit paired everything worked well. However, paring was a little difficult but that may have been the fault of the unit I was pairing to. The biggest down side is the function button. It is recessed and is difficult to press.All and all, the Jabra Bluetooth Music Adaptor does what it's supposed to. If I were to make any improvements to it, I would make the function button protrude at least 1/8"" to 3/16"" from the unit."
1,Don't buy it without verifying first if it will pair with your target device,"The manual is a dirty photocopy and it is very hard to read. Nowhere it says what it will pair to. Since I bought it to pair to my Jawbone earpiece and it doesn't work, I feel that they stole 40 dollars from me. Didn't work at advertized. Don't buy it unless you can verify with Jabra that it will work with your device!"
4,Satisfied with my Jabra Bluetooth Music adaptor,"Easy to use though I do get drops from time to time hence sync loss. It would have been better if it has a small LCD screen where it indicates connectivity, but for the price you can't ask to much. Can recommend this product."
2,Not good for biking/jogging,"I hope this is not a defect from my Jabra A120s since I didn't see other reviews complaining about this matter...Yes, the adapter works great if you're sitting in front of your computer or in a bus. But if you're like me and you like to listen to music while jogging or biking then don't buy this adapter!What happens is that with the movement of your body, the adapter keeps losing its connection to my Jabra BT620s Headset. If you're listening to music that's not so bad - just irritating. But if you are listening to a podcast you just lose the trend of thought...It's so frustrating that I had to come here and write this review... I'm hoping somebody else shares their experience with this adapter while practising sports."
2,head phone wire ordered broken not working fine. hope i could return it!!!,the over all idea about was this product is very good. if my was in good working order ti would have been very good.shk
4,Used with S9 headset.,I use this unit with my Motorola S9 headset and it works much better then the motorola ipod adapter. But the S9 controlls with not work with this unit except you can change the volume. If I face the unit the S9 will stop receiveing when I'm more then 3-4 yards away. If I carry it in my pocket it will stop receiving occasionaly. I have found it much better then my motorola IPOD adapter that will not stay linked to the headset and has even less coverage.
3,Latency is the problem,"I was hoping to use this product with my digital home recording studio. Unfortunately, the signal is delayed so real time monitoring is impossible. What is really aggrevating is the delay goes away when turning the adapter off. I realize that this is not designed for live recording, so it's my mistake. I just hope to give this information to anyone close to making the same mistake."
4,Jabra Music Adapter Works Great,The adapter is small and handy and works very well on both my cellphone or Archos video player. The only downside is having to recharge it on my computer's USB port unless I get a separate USB charger.
2,Doesn't work well with Motorola S9,"I thought the Jabra would work great with my Motorola S9 headset. Not so. Whether paired up with my Blackberry, iPod or plugging it into my TV, the signal continually skips in and out. Very frustrating."
2,Not compatible with Cardo headsets,"This product is of a very limited use. The single multifunction button/light is very small and the product manual is very poorly written. There is no information in the manual on how to delete/remove an existing pairing (if made by mistake or during testing). They should clearly state in the manual what specific Bluetooth protocols and versions a headset must have in order to pair with this adapter. Instead, the vague product description raises ones hopes but the product does not deliver on that."
5,It's perfect!,"If you have an analog audio source and want to listen to it wirelessly, this is your ticket. Coupling this adapter with any bluetooth headset is a simple push of the button. The battery lasts well over 8 hours. Sound reproduction is flawless (depending on your headset, of course.) And it's pretty easy on your wallet when you think of all the things you can use it for."
4,Jabra Bluetooth Music Adapter,"I like to listen to music via my Bluetooth headphones. Most MP3 players do not come Bluetooth enabled. This adapter steps nicely into that gap. Once the adapter is charged up, it is a simple matter of plugging into the headphone jack of my player, putting it into pairing mode, and the connecting my Bluetooth headphones.The adapter comes with a USB cord for charging, and takes several hours to charge. I wish the adapter had a bit longer cord to make it more convenient for putting it into my pocket. I have enjoyed the adapter and am sure it will get a lot of use."
5,great product,it is a great product and i made some wonderful photos on this paper. most are better than any i have paid a professional to print on and i am an amateur photographer.
5,Best Saw ever,Just bought this cause I'm doing a composite dedck on my house. For years I used the other type of circulaar saw with the blade on the wrong side. I'll never use another of those now that I've got this hypoid. Super smooth. Easy to adjust. Quality machine as are most Makita tools. Totally recommend this badboy. Wish I got one 30 yrs ago.......
4,Great Saw,Great saw. Great delivery. This particular saw was not available anywhere else. Thank you Amazon.com for your great delivery service. My boyfriend says it handles great and he can do many jobs around the house easier with this particular saw.
2,Too Heavy,"If you are sawing above your head or a long time, this saw is too heavy for a smaller person."
4,Great hypoid saw,"This is a really good hypoid saw. The magnesium makes it very lightweight, it's got an integrated rafter hook, the over-sized adjustment handles are easy to use, the lip on the blade guard doesn't catch or grab even on angle cuts, 15 amps is plenty of power and the balance is good.So why only four stars? I'm a bit tweaked that this saw doesn't come with a rip fence. There is a slot for a rip fence and other Makita saws I've purchased have come with a rip fence. If it came with the fence I'd give it five stars."
3,3.5,Its a strong saw nicely designed but Ive had a few pieces break right off of it and I havent even had it for a year. I think Ill buy a skil next.
5,Very nice purchase!,"These covers arrived 2 days earlier than I expected them, which was a very nice thing, and I was pleased to find immediately that they are very durable, very pretty and very practical. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the color/pattern on the covers was exactly as shown in the picture online - something I know isn't always the case with items. I'm quite satisfied with my purchase, and won't hesitate to purchase for miscellaneous items from Amazon in the future."
2,Caveat emptor,"I've used six of the Dataproducts color toner cartridges over the past eight months:2 worked as well as the genuine Epson product;2 produced inconsistent results, with frequent clogging of the ink jet nozzles, streaking, and spotting;2 were received leaking in their protective sealed plastic bags and had to be returned (one was actually a replacement for the other; Amazon.com's support staff was very helpful and understanding, by the way!).A 1/3 success rate isn't worth a few dollars in savings (therefore the 2 star rating). Of the dozen or so Epson cartridges I've bought, only one showed occasional poor quality output; 11/12 are far better odds, especially for small business use.The Dataproducts black/white toner, however, has shown consistent and good results ... so far. I've only bought three of these to date."
4,Definitely Worth The Price,"So far I've had no real problem with these compatible ink cartridges. I would have given it a five star rating except for the fact it does tend to clog up if you go a few days without printing. Otherwise I can tell no difference in the output quality from the original Epson cartridges. And at less than half the price of the Epson cartridges, I would most definitely recommend them to others."
3,W.C. Fields by Himself,"I remember when this book came out and should have bought it then. This was advertised as excellent collectors condition. It was not. The cover was dog eared and torn in places. Whenever I read a hard back, I take the cover off to preserve it. Definitely not worth the money I payed to have the cover. Collectors condition would indicate either perfect or very near perfect."
2,Not worth effort to publish sad to say,This book appears to me to be an effort to publish info not worth publishing working off the great name of the enigma that was W.C. Fields. Very thin in content and disappointing.
5,A Gem!,I had never heard of this movie with Clifton Webb before but stumbled across it here on Amazon. Im so glad i decided to give it a try. Its a wonderful movie with a great cast and a lot of laughs. Cliften Webb was one of the greatest character actors of all time. I recommend this movie highly.
2,"Fun movie, poor film copy or dvd transfer","I'm a fan of Clifton Webb the comedies, especially the Belvedere movies, and Mr. Scoutmaster (where he plays a similar character). FOX's recent made-on-demand release of ""Mr. Belvedere Rings the Bell"" looks fine and I recommend it. However, the copy of ""Mr. Scoutmaster"" is dark and grainy - literally swimming in grain. Actors look like they have freckles or liver spots crawling over them. Maybe it's made worse watching through a bluray player, but I was using standard connections, not HDMI. The picture is probably dark because the recording black level was affected by the grain - as if grain was part of the movie itself. I do NOT recommend this dvd at all, and wish there was a way to communicate to FOX that they need a better source copy. I imagine they have one- in comparison, I have an old AMC recording which doesnt appear to have any grain."
4,Score,"Saw a movie poster for this film at a museum and have wanted to see it. Yea, we finally found a copy and we own it."
5,Cool Movie,This item was very cool for my scouts to see. This arrived on time and was a big hit for Christmas
2,Unsatisfied,My main complaint about books edited by denes agay is that they do not lay flat. I sure wish music publishers would publish music book s with comb binding or something similar so the books will open and stay open so you're not constantly fiddling with them and cussing when they close on you while you are playing the music. Is this too much to ask for? And why doesn't Amazon inform us of the type of binding in the details of the book?
3,Review of easy classics,"This book is ok for intermediate players, not much for the beginer player. The title says EASY - not so much."
3,OK music,I purchased this for my granddaughter who is a first year piano student. Maybe she will grown into this book. It wasn't what I expected.
3,don't let the title fool u,"The book said Easy...But when i show it to the piano instructor, he said that book was too hard for my child (who have been learning piano lessons for several months already).So, it is just sitting on our shelves waiting for him to reach that level (if he ever gets there...)>"
5,Bribing the young to play!,"My young daughter was stuck on playing disney or nursery songs, and it was like pulling teeth to get her to just ""try"" one of the classics, 'you might like it!' After much goading, she finally ""tried"" a bonafide classical piece from this volume; some of it was challenging, some were easy. Ok, now we fight about who gets to play which classical piece first! :-D"
5,An Excellent Book,This book is fascinating. I read it in one day. A must have book for all Sylvia fans.
5,Spritiual,this book gives you steps on how to live your life for spritiuality. Sylvia is the best spiritualist around that can teach you how to follow the Tenets of Novus Spiritus.
2,Laughable and Ridiculous!,"Yes, I did read and browse through this bit of pre-adolescent silliness! Mainly, to determine the depths and lunacies of a vast swath of the population that actually belives some of this stuff! Frankly, the book content deserves Zero stars. But the Public Relations and Marketing probably deserves 5 Stars. Hey, 64 million US Citizens also voted for GW Bush the 2nd time around! The boundless gullibility of so many people can seemingly be made into a phenomenal money maker! But that's what makes the USA such a great country, right? (Yes, there are many other more laudable reasons, too!)"
3,Sylvia Browne If you could see what I see:The Tenets of Novus Spiritus.,"If you Could See What I See:Makes a good gift for those who believe in it, Yes I believe there are spirits and things of a spiritual nature but I am Not Gnostic or wiccan, I am A Roman Catholic,it still makes a interesting read."
3,Not as good as SB other books to me,Too many books coming out --- quality not up to that of her first few books it seems to me.Have discontinued getting her books for the time being---is there a ghost writer lurking somewhere?
3,Disappointed,"I found this to be very disappointing. I enjoy Sylvia Browne and have read a lot of her books, but this was not one of her best projects."
3,A bit disappointing,"I Loooooooooove Sylvia Browne, but felt this book to be a bit difficult to get through. There is knowledge to be gained from reading the book, but I don't think I would recommend it as a ""must read"". Mostly it is about the tenants of her religious organization; so, if that is specifically what you need to know about then this book may be the right one for you."
5,Her best yet,I've read many of her books in the past year. For me they are always uplifting and encouraging. I would have to say that this particular one was by far my favorite.Even for people that doubt her abilities as a medium this book is worth the read. The general message the book sends is inspiring.I've never felt so invigorated and empowered as I did from this book. I'm now considering studying her material she provides through Novus Spiritus [...] based upon these tenets. A life changing read.
5,Tenets of Novus Spiritus,"I love the way Sylvia writes, it's like she is sitting next to you and you are just talking with her. Her church Novus Spiritus sounds like what I have been looking for in a church. If you are shopping for a new church this is a must read."
5,If you Could...,"Yet another wonderful book! Certainly helps you to understand what it's like to be psychic, to some degree anyway. Fantastic and worth recommending"
3,Auto biography,"Didn't realise this book was the story of how Sylvia Browne came to start her own church. Although not particularly interested in that part of the book it is full of gems of wisdom that if taken on board could help anyone who reads it.Any fan of Sylvias will love it, and people like me -who'd never heard of her- enjoyed learning the lessons of life with her."
3,Some Reservations,"I do love to read Sylvia's books and think she's usually right on. I, however, feel she misses the boat on the subject of forgiveness, which she says isn't always necessary. The Course in Miracles says that forgiveness is our mission in life and our ticket out of here. It's a must for a spiritual person. Also she says hate is sometimes justified. How can that be? Our nature is love and that is what we must be."
5,This book had useful life experience in it whether you believe in psychics or not.,"I enjoyed it immensely and was quite pleased that I got something good out of it... I'm a chronic pessimist and, well, I don't want to give away what the great thing is I got out of this book but please don't approach it with a closed-mind and you could end up learning something (not necessarily earth-shaking or life-changing) but something pretty helpful just the same."
4,Interesting.....,"I found this book interesting enough to pass along this review. I think it is useful for those who wish to understand parts of themselves that perhaps they have been afraid of, or have misunderstood in the past. It helped shed some light on some of the doubts I had while growing up.I purchased this book as an afterthought. My intention was to buy ""Islands of the Soul: A Guide to Personal Truth and Happiness,"" by Victoria Tunnermann. Ms. Tunnermann's book was recommended to me before I began my own business. It gave me the confidence to begin my business, and I have encountered success every since!"
4,Good ideas for the morose,"Being gnostic means to understand spiritual things. The religion Sylvia Browne claims to have founded is ancient. There is nothing new under the sun, the old Cathars were agnostic and for that wiped out by the Catholic Church of Rome. The fact that Jesus never died on the cross is old knowledge being brought back from ancient times. It is very clear by the bible that Jesus never died on the cross because he was taken down shortly by Joseph of Arithmea as the bible states, and he walked around in flesh and blood. But I do applaud her to continue the old tradition of truth and opposition with the Roman Catholics. The time is ripe for such. This book is boring and not well written, but it is gutsy. I don't think she copied from the book ""Holy Blood, Holy Grail"" but read it."
1,"""I see dumb people""",I think what Sylvia sees best is your money flowing into her bank account...and for so little effort...Good work if you can get it!
4,Excellent Examples!,This is a good book for someone who already knows some data structures. The examples are excellent and efficiently exploit the power of C++. It covers all the subjects of data structures in a somewhat concise and elegant manner. A good book to quickly review your DS concepts if you have started forgetting them. Warning: You must have a thorough understanding of C++ to read this book.
1,Disgusting Book,This is one of the most discussing books I've ever read. It is written in incomprehensible style. I think I will fail the course if I don't buy another one.
1,Useless textbook,"I am a senior and a 4.0 student and this is one of the worst textbooks I have had as an undergraduate. I agree both with the reviewers who criticized this book (You WILL need to find a different book to help you pass your tests, because this one is incomprehensible) and with those who praise the book (This book is comprehensible and to the point IF you already know most of the material and have a very strong base in C++). Not a good textbook!! If you are an instructor, please don't use it in your class."
2,Not for Intermediate Programmers,"This is the textbook for my undergraduate data structures class. In my opinion this book is more suited to graduate level study, or for very experienced C programmers. The author assumes that you have a very solid grounding in C language structure and discrete math, his examples are often cryptic and incomplete leaving it up to the reader to figure out what is meant. In my opinion this book is not well suited for learning the fundamentals of data structures, and I'm still looking for one that is."
1,Hard to digest !!!,"It is clearly not a self-study material and one needs to refer to other books, for better understanding. On certain crucial topics, you are left in the dark, to solve the remainder of the problem as an exercise. It might be a great book in a class where the professor will provide you with the required examples and solutions, but I don't think one should take it up as a self-study book."
1,"Cryptic, difficult to follow, not a good book","The author writes, ""...the [this] book usually provides about one-half to three-quarters of an implementation, and the student is encouraged to supply the rest."" This means that you need to buy another, real, reference book (which this book is not)."
2,2 out of 3 worked,"I bought three of these ... 2 of them worked with no problem, but the third was dead out of the gate. Given how inexpensive, you'd think I'd feel ahead of the game, but I really needed that 3rd cartridge and had a ton of work to get done. So ... warning ... if you buy this, at least have a backup Epson."
2,"Mudras, where?","I agree with the other reviewer: There's little on mudras especially given the title. And there's not enough shown in the Amazon ""Look Inside"" to make a decision about the book. So 2 stars to the book and 2 stars to Amazon here."
5,Beautiful and inspiring....,This is one of the most complete and best books on mantras and mudras that I've come across. Lillian Too is at her best in this teaching guide to the Eastern traditions.
1,A Very Thought Provoking Book,"The evidence uncovered in this book was very impressive. The author was thorough in most aspects and very imformative. Having a friend who died on TWA Flight 800, I have been following the case from the moment it was telecast and the only sensible thing I have read is from this book. It seems like another of our government's cover-ups that won't be known about for probably another 30 or 40 years."
1,Don't waste you money!,"What a disappointment! In Houston, Clyde Wilson reportedly knows all the secrets of the high and mighty and helped some of them get to their positions of power. What could have been a riveting book is instead a repetitive collection of old stories that all sound the same: the police are stupid and Clyde is not. Other than a brief chapter on the Hermann Trust scandal, the book deals with mundane matters and very mundane people that all begin to sound alike after a few chapters. Don't waste your money."
4,Poulenc Complete Piano Music,Pianist very effectively captures the spontaneous and carefree mood of the pieces. A good addition to one's music library. A kaleidoscopic delight.
2,Orny Adams Takes The Third Review,"I happened upon this while browsing comedy specials and gave it a try based on all the positive reviews I saw. It was painfully average, the subject matter was trite and overdone, and the deliveries and wordings were formulaic. While I appreciate his Lewis Black-esque angry enthusiasm, there's nothing thought-provoking or original in here. Bummer."
1,100% predictable,He had nothing but tired jokes I've heard 100 times before and a manic delivery that made me want to kick him in the nuts so that he wouldn't be able to reproduce. All the five star reviewers are obviously family and friends.
2,35 five-star reviews out of 39? Check IMDB (4.8) something is not right,"Saw that this was very high rated so me and my GF decided to check it out. To my surprise, it was just not very funny - and amazon's reviews are generally pretty reliable. Then I went back and checked, almost every review is 5 stars - yet on imdb it gets a brutal 4.8/10. These reviews seem worked..."
2,"Some good material, grating presentation","Orny has some pretty funny material. However, the presentation is repetitive and sometimes grating. He's almost like a younger Lewis Black, only not quite as funny and not as endearing. He should try to not be so angry and repetitive during his routine.As another reviewer stated, this comedy special isn't nearly as funny as the overall rating and number of 5 star reviews would seem to indicate."
1,Not sure how this has so many 5 star reviews.,This was not funny at all. Not once did I even smile while watching this. I am lucky that this was included with my Prime membership....not worth a penny.
4,Stooges rule!,"I am a Three Stooges fan. This video lived up to the shorts I remember seeing on late night TV. The quality of the shorts were very high. The only problem I had was that I thought I was getting all of the Jerome ""Curly"" Howard shorts. I was disappointed that the one short I was looking for was not included in the set. It was made the next year. So I will be looking for volume #5."
5,Twilight,This dvd set is full of great shorts but this is where we start to see the signs of Curly's health wearing down. It will be sad to watch him deteriorate in these shorts but I know all fans appreciate how Curly gave his life for this comedy team.
5,Good To The Last Woo-Woo-Woo!,"Nice collection of some really funny Stooge comedies with Curly. This collection does include the Stooge shorts where Curly's illness is sadly evident. Still, Curly was still able to give his all and this collection is a delight for Stooge fans everywhere. So, listen you Grapeheads, buy this collection or I'll give you the new fingers. New fingers? Those are the old ones. They'll do. 'Poke'. Oh, Oh!!!"
4,Best Collection,My sons and I have the Volumes 1 -4 of the Stooges collection and this has some of our favorite shows. We love the vaudeville and wolfman show in particular. Always good for a few laughs.
1,buy the compendium,this is just a single disc...its more economical and entertaining to buy the entire compendium of discs by the 3 Stooges covering the first 10 years because you get all the movies right up until the time Curley left the group and Shemp joined. Plus in the compendium bonus materials you get a very large number of shorts featuring Shemp and others ...it about doubles the value received for dollars spent......don't buy the single discs........and if Shemp is your favorite Stooge then these discs from the first 10 years up until 1945 are not the correct bunch....you should buy all the disc collection from 1945 to 1955 to get Shemp
5,The Three Stooges Collection,I have the entire collection that i bought from amazon.com. The quality is great. Video and audio are really good quality. I watch these all the time. I leave a dvd in the player all the time until i want to move on to another three stooge dvd. Lots of fun. Highly recommended.
5,Worked great,"I am not sure what the other reviewer was doing wrong, but I found the device simple to connect and use. I tried the SlimP3 and the SimpleFi, and they were both horrible.The HP device automatically found all my digital music (700 CDs all ripped in WMA format) and digital pictures, and I was up and running pretty fast.If you want a digital music player that is good for your personal collection, that your whole family can use, I highly recommend this device.The unit also automatically organized my music by Genre, Artist, and Album - VERY handy!"
4,Works as advertised after firmware update,"Per the other reviews listed, out of the box wireless performance is very poor. HP posted a firmware update on 10/7/2003 that DRAMATICALLY improve wireless performance. Before, my player would drop its connection after 5-15 minutes. After the update, its run for hours on end without interruption. The upgrade is a bit of a hassle but the results are worth it!"
1,EW5000 review,"Don't even think about getting this product (unless you enjoy long romantic calls with overseas tech support). I cannot begin to state all its faults, (802.11 only works if the wind is right and Jupiter and Mars are aligned, GUI straight outta movie TRON, remote for my 1970s garage door better designed, would get better return on $... by investing in Enron), but whoever gave this product the go-ahead should be fired. If they ever release a version 2 that actually works, it might be worth it (but probably not). Feel free to ignore this advice and buy it; just block an otherwise free weekend, join a rage management group and consider yourself warned."
3,"WHAT YOU ALREADY KNEW, BUT NEVER REALIZED","I THOUGHT THIS BOOK WAS OKAY, AND INFORMATIVE IN THE SENSE THAT I DIDN'T KNOW (OR WAS AFRAID TO ADMIT) MY WEAKNESSES, AND AT THE SAME TIME I FOUND OUT MY STRENGTHS WHICH WAS COOL BECAUSE I CAN USE IT TO MAKE MYSELF STRONGER AND MORE CONFIDENT."
5,dirty looks delivers,"This is a cd i brought back out of my collection to listen to.Each time i listen to it it gets better.Point of view ,raining in the sun ,and loveless are killer tracks.Dirty looks continue to release great rock and roll cds"
5,it's Fun!,"i liked this game VERY much. Only, after a while i got a little tired. The checkers game was fun at first, but to me, it wasn't a challenge. But of course that's my opinon. But over all, it was fun."
5,excellent resource for watercolorists,"This is probably the best book on watercolor techniques that I have found. It does not have copy cat""do it like this"" instructions but rather has real techniques that you can use to improve your personal style and subjects."
5,Paint Watercolors that Dance with Light,The author really reved up my creative juices. Her transparent colors are exciting. I especially liked her instructions for masking and making the most of the white paper. Her colors are intense and 'sing'. I learned a lot from this book.
4,Paint WATERCOLOURS THAT dance with light,"A very comprehensive and well laid-out book written by someone who clearly knows her craft,this is an excellent product for all skills levels, congratulations and thanks."
4,clear and detailed,This book is excellent in describing the technique of using light and shadow. Wonderful for new and expereinced painters wishing to add dimension to their work.
5,Great Book Full of Techniques,"I would highly recommend this book to a novice, because it contains a ton of basic techniques and skills. It might be all you need to get started. However, there is definitely a lot of useful information in this book for someone who's been painting for awhile. It's important to note the author's style of painting before you buy. She is extremely detail-oriented, definitely a realist, and loves to paint pure, clean colors via glazing. Her techniques can be helpful even if you're not a realist, but it's best to buy this book if you're looking to paint like her."
5,Wonderful tips!,"A beautiful book of tips in watercolor painting, I am sure it will be used far into the future. This artist has a background so similar to me that I felt a bond immediately. Much of the info I knew because I am more advanced but did not regret buying it and it is perfect for a beginning watercolor painter."
4,"Excellent Book, Inspiring","I don't agree with the other reviewer, maybe he was looking for a kind of book like K. Callan's. I like this book, because it provides what most aspiring actors, directors, writers need, that is, inspiration. It provide full of ideas to break in showbiz, the importance of networking, the difference with the corporate world. If you are looking for acting books, I recommend Acting is everything, a book full of resources and savvy advice."
2,This is old information.,There is some decent information in here but for the most part it's an outdated book. I'm not in the business though so what do I know.
4,Delightful!,"This book lives up to its wonderful title in every way! I laughed out loud at Jenn's travails during potty training and pet selection. My eyes teared up more than once as she shared the lessons God has taught her through the antics of her children. A wonderful book, and a quick read - but there's depth to be found within these pages."
5,yeah,"Me personally...when me & mine bump the triple Six...Specially this junt, gotta be smokin a big fat Swisha loaded with the stickiest, Greenest Nug we can get our fingers on & Sippin on some Seagrams or some Greygoose...actually f*** the sippin', str8 Chuggaluggin' this shizz...gotta love it.."
3,WM Book Better,"This book was helpful. However I found another book I purchased just as helpful if not more so. Building an Effective WM, loved this book."
5,remember when....,I love the thoughts in this book..It's good to give to a loved one. Someone you know well. I find that it was relaxing to the mind. It helped me understand life. I passed on to my sister as a gift and she enjoyed it. She is a big fan of kim anderson books. And she has other books that are like this one. Really it's a good book.
4,Very happy to have found these pans on Amazon,"I was looking for a good baking pan for my convection/microwave oven and it needed to be 12""...I wanted to use it for pizza, but other uses too, including rolls and just plain baking...It works great and is so easy to clean... Can't cook anything really juicy though as the rim is not high enough to prevent spills...."
3,Only lasted 2 days,"I got this for my son, it is a smashing little toy, but it is not durable. It broke within 2 days so I wouldn't recommend for small children."
2,Pointless,This toy is useless. The cord is so short you can't pull it behind you. It is placed in a weird spot on the dogs head. The plastic is very cheap too. If you want to collect all the toy story toys and leave them on the self this would be fine but if your giving it to kids don't bother.
4,Made my little sister's day!,"This toy is pretty good for it's value. It is small and the cord is a little too short but it's fine. My 4 year old sister collects toy story toys and just the look on her face when she saw it was priceless. it's pretty durable, i guess, because I have tried to tangle the spring by twisting it but it's still fine."
4,Great for your Toy Story lover,We originally purchased the bigger version of the Slinky Dog but it was much too cumbersome and noisy for my son to play with so we returned it and bought this one instead. It isn't the most durable toy (much like a slinky) it has kinks and bends but overall he still loves this toy. It works in his creative play recreating Toy Story moments. Much better purchase than the big one. He really loves it and I would recommend it.
3,The very small Slinky,"The toy is identical to the film but ... it's very small! It's actually more of a toy collection that one to play. Suitable for placing on a shelf. My daughter loved it, but I would have preferred it to be larger. Very fast shipping"
3,Nice Toy,"This is a cute toy from the movie. I really thought it was going to be a bit larger, but its a very tiny, pocket sized toy. Still very cute. Perfect for an older toddler. I bought this as a gift and the little boy that plays with it really likes it. However the pull string is a little short even for a 2 year old, so he needs to bend over to pull it along and it does not roll as well as I had hoped. Overall, the toy seems durable and good for him to play with, but I dont know how long it will last."
2,Slinky Dog SMALL,"I received this slinkly dog for my four year old daughter. Although she loooves Toy Story I found this dog to be extremely small. Just a little bigger than a barbie doll, in my opinion. I have not given it to her yet for Christmas and even though I know she will love it - -my impression is that it is too small."
2,Picture is deceiving! Beware!,"This was SO SO much smaller than I expected. The one picture of the girl pulling the dog behind her is nothing short of deception! The dogs string is about 4 inches long...definitely not long enough for my 37 inch child to pull while walking! It doesn't stand up, which leads to frustration for my 3 year old. I mean its a cute toy if you want a cheap ""slink"" to join your Toy Story Collection. I wish I would have went for the more pricey one! I am sure it wouldn't of been so small and useless other than decoration!"
3,Smaller than it looks in the photo,"The toy looks much larger in the picture with the child than it actually is. It's quite small. That being said, my nephew loves Toy Story and was in love with the toy and was dragging it around with him all day, so I guess it was a good gift, afterall."
3,cute,"My 3 yr old is a big toy story fan and received all the main characters for christmas. You have to have a slinky dog. This was a mini one, You can not pull him around. My son loves just to hold him so it worked out great!"
3,NOT THE SIZE PICTURED,This is a teenie tiny table top size dog. This is not the pull toy dog shown in the pictures with the girl.
4,Not the most sturdy,this is the greatest looking slink I have seen. My toddler likes to stuff things in the coils and it caused them to deform on the first day but I can't complain too much - I don't think the toy was designed for his age group.
3,Very small,This is a cute MINI slinky dog toy. I should have read the description closer to get a better idea of how small it really was.
2,False advertisement,The pics show a child pulling dog behind them. Very unlikely it is small perfect for the hands of a toddler to hold. I got it for my son for christmas he has not recieved it yet. I think he will like it but not as much as he would have had it truly been the size of pic. He is almost 6 and loves the slinky dog.
2,Sorry slinky.,"My wife was all excited to get this toy for my 3 yr old but he didn't have much fun with it. I think they thought it was going to ""behave"" like the character in the movie. Kids really did not play with him much and I believe he was in two pieces the last time I saw him. Sorry slinky dog!"
2,slinky dog,"My granddaughter loved it at first until the slinky part got bent. It wouldn't ""walk"" far without falling over before it got bent. I don't think it's an educational toy."
3,X'mas present,I bought for my 2years boy. He like it. But this toy is just decolation now. And little bit stand hard.
3,"The picture is deceiving, but it's a sturdy toy.","The picture showing Slinky Dog being pulled by the girl is NOT of this toy. It is of the actual toy, not the ""Jr."" Unfortunately, there was no size or picture of the toy in the packaging in the description; so I thought this was the item pictured.... Boy was I wrong. I would say it's maybe 5"" (when not stretched) and no more than 3"" high.For the price though, I'm not complaining. My son loves Slinky Dog and I know he'll love this.PROS:SturdyMade of heavy plasticActual metal slinky partPull string is a good length for 3-4 year oldCONS:MUCH smaller than pictured"
1,Extremely Small disapointed,"I thought the toy was like the one the picture of the girl, and is veryvery small :("
4,Cool toy but not necessarily for the little ones.,"Problem not specific to slinky dog but to slinkies in general. I forgot how dangerous those metal edges look, they arent sharp but not a great toy for unsupervised play. In two days my little one has already managed to deform the metal coils. Also when pulled by the string slinky dog doesnt stay up on all four feet, it looks more like he is scratching his rear on the floor."
3,Small side,This was on the small side but a christmas present for a three year old. He loves it and that is all that counts.
5,Great,Looks just like the one in the movie. Isn't sharp or too long so it seems safe. Graet for a four year old.
2,Not for kids,"I bought this toy as a gift for my five years old nephew, but after twice that he stretched the dog, it never returned to the original shape. I think the dog is okay if you don't want to play with it."
1,poof-Slinky228 Disney Pixar Toy Story Slinky Dog Junior,This is supposed to be a pull toy but would not lay flat on floor so it could be pulled. Instead it curled up into a ball and dragged willie nilly in a ball. Absollutely useless.
5,Excellent substitute for a pilates class,"I have used this DVD faithfully for the last couple of years, especially as a way to keep doing Pilates when living overseas or traveling. It has a convenient assortment of two short workouts and one long one. I tend to alternate the short ones to avoid getting bored, doing them at home on days I don't have a pilates class. The long one is a great substitute for a class when there is no studio available. The video is adequately challenging, so it can be used for a long time. I highly recommend this DVD."
2,"Disappointing track after ""Sing it Back"" and ""Time is Now""","Moloko, the duo, disappoint with this release. Essentially a mundane repetitive and thoroughly uninspiring funk groove, masquerading as innovative, thanks to a few wobbly effects, 'Pure Pleasure Seeker' plods along without ever really getting anywhere. Sure, Roisin Murphy's distinctive, sultry vocals are as effective as ever, but on the evidence of this it's easy to see why their most inspired work has been produced when they have been remixed by others."
3,you're better off buying an old style model,"I bought one of these thinking I was getting the big clunky old-style model, and the XO arrived. It's okay, but I thought it sounded muddy. It's not a bad delay, and it is true bypass, but for less money you can get a used one which has a much warmer sound."
1,Where is the air pressure?,"I bought 2 of these at Wal Mart, one for each car. I should have known there was a reason they have them marked down to $6.50 each, they are hoping it will cost you more than that in fuel to drive them back to the store. I tried them both on a low tire the next morning and I believe it would have taken about 1 hour to move the tire gauge from 21 PSI up to 32 PSI. I could barely feel the air pulse on the tip of my finger when running wide open.I can't imagine how long it would take to air up a completely flat tire.I took them back (since I had 2, a $13 plus tax refund made it attractive to me)> I'm still looking for a good alternative..."
5,Great White's Jack Russell shows he's just as gifted solo!,Well crafted songs by Great White's lead singer Jack Russell. This leans on the mellow side but are well crafted songs by a legendary fixture in 80s classic L.A. rock! Jack's other solo CD is equally well done and highly recommended!
1,Stoker's Spinning In His Grave!,"Will the 1990s fascination with romanticizing blood-sucking monsters ever end? First, there was Francis Ford Coppola's bastardization, insultingly titled ""Bram Stoker's DRACULA,"" when it had less to do with Stoker than even the Lugosi film of 1931! Now, this MINA: THE DRACULA STORY CONTINUES comes along to further desecrate Stoker's masterpiece. Where are the bats, the mists, the wolves, the deeds of horror and bloodlust? If you want some mushy romance novel, then this is fine. If you want a true sequel to DRACULA that's a gothic horror story in the tradition of Stoker, then THIS AIN'T IT!! (Note: This review was of the original, Sept. 1994 release under the pseudonym Marie Kiraly.)"
3,An interesting idea but an overdone erotic twist,"Having followed the exploits of Mina Harker in Alan Moore's ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlement"" it was interesting to read a different extrapolation of what happened to her after ""Dracula."" Obviously, this book focuses more on the original cast without bringing a host of other supernatural beings into the story. My complaint, like so many others, is that the retroactive overlaying of so much eroticism onto the original novel. There was some, but it was subtle and implied. Stoker was not writing soft porn. However, Marie Kiraly is--and without the benefit of the Count himself. You know what? This book would have worked a lot better if the story had not involved the title character. How's that for ironic?"
5,Mina,"I enjoyed Mina from the first word to the last. I have read and enjoyed Elaine's writing from the first Vampire novel to Mina and am looking forward to her new book, 'Blood to Blood' and intend to pick it up in the very new future. Elaine's writing is so realistic that I find myself actually walking the streets longing for the touch of the Vampire Lord himself. Please keep up the good work and continue to write as I look forward to each and every novel."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Mina: The Dracula Story Continues by Marie Kiraly is really pretty ordinary. It focuses on her, not surprisingly, and how it affects her relationship with her husband and others, after having been in the thrall of a powerful vampire.Because of this, Harker the female is certainly not your average housewife of the time. Not a whole lot of point."
1,A desecration of a classic!,"There have been some pretty lame attempts to write sequels to Bram Stoker's classic DRACULA, but this is one that borders on blasphemy! It reeks of Anne Ricean sub-par eroticism and Fred Saberhagen's ill-advised revisionism, as well as just being a bad story. It's a shame that Stoker's novel was never officially copyrighted in the U.S., and that the international copyrights have all lapsed. At least then the Count would be safe from well-meaning clods and talentless hacks like Bergstrom. You want good DRACULA pastiches? Check out Kim Newman's ANNO DRACULA books and stories, or Jeanne Kalogridis' DIARIES OF THE FAMILY DRACUL trilogy."
2,"ok, but quickly became discredited","I was about 1/4 of the way into the book, it was alright, I was enjoying it, but then they mentioned Lucy... I had taken note of the author's careful way of sticking to the original novel, so I passed it off as bad editing, or just a type-o when she referred to Lucy Westerna. The next time Lucy's last name (Westenra, in the original) was misspelled, the credibility of the story kind of went down the drain. I plowed through the rest of it, but it just goes to show how one little mistake can ruin an otherwise above-average novel."
1,An abomination against Stoker!,"Will the 1990s fascination with romanticizing blood-sucking monsters ever end? First, their was Francis Ford Coppola's bastardization, insultingly titled ""Bram Stoker's DRACULA,"" when it had less to do with Stoker than even the Lugosi film of 1931! Now, this MINA: THE DRACULA STORY CONTINUES comes along to further desecrate Stoker's masterpiece. Where are the bats, the mists, the wolves, the deeds of horror and bloodlust? If you want some mushy romance novel, then this is fine. If you want a true sequel to DRACULA that's a gothic horror story in the tradition of Stoker, then THIS AIN'T IT!!"
4,Very good book,"Pragmatic Ajax: A Web 2.0 Primer (Pragmatic)This is a very good book, if you want to jump into Web 2 development. Authors waste no time in getting you up and running with practical examples. Examples are chosen wisely, explanation is excellent. Just keep in mind that the book is what it says, it is a primer, besides Web 2 is a big topic, yet authors do a remarkable job."
3,Nice Flow,"The book starts with the origins of AJAX and covers its roots very well. The programming examples are well explained. The Google Maps example is particularly interesting but may confuse a novice developer. More cases of when to use AJAX should have been covered, however this book can launch you into the world of AJAX"
2,Don't waste your time,"Nothing like the classic ski school, that made you laugh. This was a waste of film, and amazon is going to charge you for it. Save yourself the pain I had to endure, nothing like the orginal, not that I expected to be, can't replace a classic. Acting was shoddy Dean tried but couldn't cover for the hideous attempt at acting from the other characters. No Fitz, No Johnny, No Ed. You can see what is coming from the beginning so makes it a no brainer he is going to get the girl, or at least thinks he is."
2,A failed sequel,"NO comparison to the first one. Slow and boring, and the character of Dave Marshak is just not what he was in the first one. A sequel to pass up."
3,Ski School II,"A Sequel To A Obvious Ripp Off Of Animal House, This College Party Comedy Nonetheless, Is Hilarious Due To The Comic Mastery Of Dean Cameron Who Plays The Leader Of A Wacky Bunch Of Ski Bums...Dave Marshak (Cameron) And His Entarage Of Skiing Party Animals Are Threatened To Be Thrown Out Of The Resort Due To Beth's (Heather Cambell) Sinester And Humdrum New Boyfriend...Dave Embarks To Save Them From Their Unwilling Departure From The Resort And To Rescue Beth From Boredom..."
4,Just as advertised,I got what they advertised. Same version light wear. worked great for my class. shipping was reasonable. Great alternative to buying the newest version.
5,Sean Bean rules in Sharpe's Rifles,Lieutenant Richard Sharpe and his Chosen Men of the 95th Rifles rock in Sharpe's Rifles. This is perhaps the greatest series of war films set in the period of the Napoleonic Wars.
5,Fascinating Historical Series,"I have not read the books from which this series is taken but if they are half as fascinating as these videos, they must be outstanding. The presentation of this collection of intriguing characters interacting against the background of the Napoleanic wars is completely engrossing. Richard Sharpe, the guttersnipe risen from the ranks, is brilliantly portrayed by Sean Bean and Darragh O'Malley as his faithful sidekick is also excellent. One of the most effective aspects of this series is the soundtrack, which is stirring and perfectly suited to the times depicted. All the performances are well done and in considerable depth, from Hugh Frazer as Wellington to each of the Chosen Men, and every episode is full of fascinating villains, beautiful (and, more to the point, interesting) women, fierce enemies, treacherous insiders and loyal followers, with the central focus on Sharpe, handsome, honorable and tough as nails. What more can you ask?"
5,To soon over,"I have viewed the complete series and after 20 plus hours I find the only bad thing about it is that it ended. Unlike so many movies and series where the sequel deminishes in quality, Sharpe retains it high entertainment ratio. I believe that it is due to the original author Bernard Cornwell. I have read his eleven books and the eleventh is as enthralling as the first. This is a story that gives you history and entertainment together in a beautiful story. Well worth the money and I am sure that I will veiw my tapes over and over in the future. Sudami"
5,Sharpe Vrs. Napoleon,"From the moment Richard Sharpe saves Arthur Wellesley from 3 French dragoons, his life is changed forever. As the future Lord Wellington advises this hard bitten British soldier, ""You did me a damn good turn, now I'm going to do you a damn bad one"", and promotes the brave man to the rank of Lieutenant. However, our hero Mr. Sharpe is not what his fellow officers consider a ""gentlemen"". Not being of privileged birth in a system steeped in social stratification, our Richard must continue to demonstrate his worth by deeds of honor and valor. And, prove himself he does. Through each installment of this enjoyable series, Sharpe and his trusted Sergeant Harper lead their group of ""Chosen men"" through one difficult scrape after the other. I love the entire Sharpe series but this first batch of four videos has some truly unforgettable moments. In the tradition of ""Zulu"" and ""Gunga Din"", if you love tales of the tenacious English soldier, testosterone and Napoleon, Sharpe is your man."
4,Excellent Introduction to Coaching Soccer,"This is a fine book on coaching youth soccer. There are many competing books, most of which are very similar. All competing books, and this one as well, emphasize basic skills and techniques. What distinguishes this book is the attention to detail and the emphasis on a systematic approach to coaching. Each chapter is very well written with good descriptions of techniques and good drills. The author encourages the development of a long term graduated approach to introducing and refining skills. Very good illustrations. As an experienced youth coach, I have looked at a lot of coaching books and this is the best single book."
5,Amazing Performance,Boyz II Men is amazing. I have seen their show twice this year alone. Both shows were incredible. They are very entertaining and of course their music is sensational. You will not be disappointed!
3,Boyz II Men's small concert,"The performance is great, however, they haven't really perform 50% of all the best hits they have + the play time is less than the average.Will be a very good addition to A+ fans"
3,"Good Value for Price, but Best On Smaller Cameras","I married this to a recently purchased Canon Powershot 10SX IS. Given the relatively small size of this product and the equally small size of the Powershot, they work quite well together. The flash has the limitations one would expect with size...this is not a professional instrument, but certainly a step up from the on-board flash of the Powershot. I would not recommend for pro or serious hobbyists who have high expectations from their digital SLR equipment."
1,defective copy,"The book I received was missing pages, actually the number of pages was correct but duplicates of pages 151-182 were in place of what should have been pages 215-246."
5,AWESOME!,"BOUGHT THIS BOOK FOR A FRIEND WHO IS INTERESTED IN BECOMING A PERSONAL FITNESS TRAINER. HE CALLED TODAY SAYING ""THE BOOK IS AWESOME"" A ""REAL"" WORK BOOK WITH A WEALTH OF INFORMATION FOR ANYONE SINCERLY INTERESTED IN THIS FIELD.."
4,A strange but good book,"I read this book as a child. I felt it was a very odd story. Wuggie Norple and his family lead strange lives. However, I liked it. I felt it was funny and read it many times growing up."
1,NOT USA made as Amazon says. Standard generic Chinese hose.,"I just received my hose, and am outraged to see that it is marked ""Made in China"" every 16 inches. The inside of the cardboard hose holder is also marked ""made in China"".It is overpriced for a Chinese hose. Save your money and buy a generic cheapie. that's what this is.Why on Earth does Amazon claim Made in USA, when their lie is so obvious?I bought this to avoid the normal Chinese air hose failure, and still got a Chinese hose. How disappointing. BTW, the normal Chinese air hose failure is a leak in the inner liner that causes a giant bubble and then a burst of the outer jacket. It has a two year warranty, but requires that I return it with the original packing. And then what........another Chinese hose with the same weaknesses."
1,NOT RECOMMENDED FOR COLLECTORS,"DILLON PROVIDED NO DESCRIPTIONS OF SHEET MUSIC LISTED IN HER CATALOG. ESPECIALLY DISAPPOINTING IS THE LACK OF COMPOSERS / LYRICISTS (AUTHORS) OF EACH ITEM. SEVERAL VERSIONS OF SHEET MUSIC FOR ANY GIVEN ITEM MAY HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED IN A GIVEN YEAR (BROADWAY, MOVIES, OR PIANO VERSION) AND COLLECTORS ARE NOT PROVIDED THE DISTINCTION OF WHICH PIECE OF SHEET MUSIC DILLON IS REFERRING TO WHEN PLACING ISSUING A $ VALUE. SAVE YOUR MONEY A LOOK FOR PRICE GUIDES BY MARION SHORT."
2,A good compilation but not the songs listed,"This is not a bad compilation of songs from 1981, but it does not include songs listed in the advertisement. Notably Bette Davis Eyes and Jessies Girl are listed as songs on the CD, but they were not on the CD I received. It would seem this problem should be corrected because those were two of the reasons I ordered."
5,THE BEST BOOK I EVER READ!,"This is the best book I've ever read! It is a really origonal idea and it may not seem very scary to some people but it scared me to death, the idea of finding out you're one of several clones and all the other clones died when they were a week older than you! I have to AT LEAST skim through the book every day, I love it so much! It has a surprise ending, but I'm not going to tell you what it is! My mom read this book, and even she loved it! Anybody could enjoy this book!"
1,Avoid this book like the plague,"I read this book with faith that the book would pick up, that the plot wouldthicken, that, at least, everything would come together at the end.None of these happened for me.The earth did not move.I would rate TM a 1: don't waste your time."
2,More about bad conditions in turn of the century kitchens,"The author seems to be covering up his lack of research with a rather maudlin bonding with a fellow cook(i.e. Mary). I now know more than I ever wanted to know about turn of the century kitchens and the abused psyches of chefs,but very little about Mary Mallon. Better sources are Biography magazine's article about her and Leavitt's Typhoid Mary: Captive to the Public's Health."
2,not up to bourdain's usual standard,"Bourdain is a brilliant writer, but his heart doesn't seem to be in this book. It feels as if someone asked him to write this book as an assignment, his usual style of pop-culture loaded hyperbole only takes off in a few chapters. Several entire chapters are filler copied from other sources.'Kitchen Confidential' and 'Cook's Tour' are definately his most inspired books. If you have read those as well as 'The Nasty Bits' and are hungry for more I highly recommmend his crime fiction novel 'Bone in Throat'."
3,"Entertaining, But Lightweight","An entertaining urban historical of the infamous Typhoid Mary Mallon - the Irish cook with pestilence coursing through her ... um... bum. This one is a bit different because it's written by a chef who looks at Mary's life from the perspective of what it must have been like for a hard-working immigrant cook at the turn of the century, and he throws in a lot of details regarding the lack of cleanliness of the time which makes it a bit more understandable why Mary didn't tend to wash her hands after relieving herself, and thus prevent the spread of Typhoid Fever. Bourdain is decidedly sympathetic of Mary, when it's pretty obvious that Mary had a whole lot to do with bringing her misfortune upon herself... which makes you wonder: if Bourdain were offered some of Mary's trademark peach ice cream, would he have eaten it?"
2,Ok...,"I read this book for a project for a Criminalistics class for a Summer camp. I was looking forward to learning about Typhoid Mary and all about her problems as she lived her life carrying the deadly typhoid. I was a little disappointed to find out that a lot of the book was about the context of the life she lived in. I'm sure that for some...that would be a nice touch, but I was looking more forward to reading about the case than about society. But other than that, I thought it was a good read. I found myself laughing quite a bit, thanks to the clever way that Anthony Bourdain narrated this novel. Not a Number #1 choice...but not the worse i've read either. I'll let you decide....."
3,tossed off...,"While I've utterly enjoyed Bourdain's offhand, conversational style in his earlier books (particularly Kitchen Confidential and Bone in the Throat), here it sounds too casual. For all his assertions in KC that he just wakes up and writes a bit, writing is a craft and this time out the author does not pay enough attention to it. Too bad -- the story (which was probably largely researched by others, according to the acknowledgments) is interesting, and Bourdain's take on it is fresh. But sloppy writing -- repeated words and phrases, cliches, etc. -- really slow down this short tome. If this were a dish, I doubt Bourdain would have let it out of his kitchen, and someone at Bloomsbury should have pointed this out."
3,First pan because of a poor title.,"I might mention that this book has nothing whatsoever to do with embroidery of the Carolingian Empire of seventh- through tenth- century western Europe.Carolingian here is from the Barony of Carolingia, a Society of Creative Anachronism group the eastern US."
4,Suprisingly good,"Based on the cover and the name, I wasn't expecting much from this book. But when I flipped through it, I very pleasently suprised... I would say at least 50% of this book is unique. I've never seen anything like the Abstract chapter (which is mainly why I bought the book). Some of the chapters that contain material I've seen before were done better than I've seen in any other book. The buttons chapter, for example, is better than anything in the Wow book or the Down and Dirty book and the Interfaces chapter is more detailed and informative that anything I've sen in another Photoshop book... on the Earth, Text, and Trimmings chapters--which are just more polished versions of tutorials you can find on the Web. Overall, though, I would say it was money well spent. I'm already getting in the habit of using those shortcut keys, to. Another solid Friends of Ed book!"
3,Download project files not possible,"I bought this book recently because I want to learn to make textures myself. It is a nice book with lots of information but I was disappointed that it is not possible to download the projectfiles because the book is too old.If I had known that before I would not have bought it.So if there is anyone out there who can help me to get them,let me know!"
4,useful tricks,Anyone who is addicted to Photoshop will find this book a good addition to their bookshelf. If you are into simply adding a few bits and pieces to pictures or contructing entire images from scratch there are useful ideas here. My only criticism is the insistence on the use of key stroke notation. I much prefer to use a mouse rather than the keyboard as it is much more intuitive. Apart from this a great book.
4,power effects!,very clear tutorials.it's easy to do and you can use them in different situations.it's a good point to start.
1,by far the worst for anyone,The author mislead many steps and skips alot of stuff to make the reader very confused. Some of the keystrokes he mention doesnt even work and i have read 3-5 times to figure what the author wants to do...Dont waste your money on this.
2,So much hope - so little delivery,"First off - right up front...if you are on a Mac - which the majority of the graphics Photoshop world is - FORGET this book. Written for the arcane world of the PC Microsoft afflicted, it becomes tedious trying to figure out the right keyboard combinations to follow the chapters. They looked so good! They looked like so much fun! They were like flying an airplane blind...How many times does one have to go back and retrace steps to try and make your images look like the authors? How many notes do you have to scribble in the margins to translate this glop? Now, with Photoshop 7 in our machines...using this book becomes an even grander hunt for clarity. Guys - please update this for Photoshop 7 and dump the PC approach. Make it for the real graphics world to use, not just yourselves...Thanks."
5,Sudoku Puzzles for Kids,"I bought this for my 5 1/2 year old grandson. He was very interested in the Sudoku puzzles we were doing but even the easy ones were too much for him to grasp without help. This is a very simple, easy book for young children to start on and he can do it and loves it!"
3,"""Ready"" Cole Was Not But The Album Still has Merit......","1983 wasn't a good year for the ""Diva"". Her drug issues was taking it's toll on Natalie and her stunning vocal abilities. Sony Music had the right idea for re-releasing this back in 1991 when Cole was taking the world by storm with ""Unforgettable With Love"". Natalie manages to strain her way through this effort with several stand-out tracks: ""Too Much Mister"", ""I Won't Deny You"", ""Time Heals All Wounds"", ""Where's Your Angel"" And I personally wish the ""Diva"" would re-record ""I'm Your Mirror"". It is such a powerful tune written by the singer, whom we all know she would ""Belt"" it out correctly as she had meant to do back then........"
1,Very big disappointment !!,"Having recently ordered a similar set of Johnny Carson, I was looking forward to seeing Red and expected to get something besides very poor video quality and alot of tape wasted on commercial breaks. These were not his best moments by far! You need to add 0 stars to the rating choice."
4,Colorful adventure,"This is probably the best of George Montgomery's ""South Sea Island adventures"" - full of macho heroics but fast moving, action-packed and entertaining,just ignore the politics!! Print could be sharper but very good for the collector."
2,Disbelief is not a license to dis,"Ms. Walker has a great deal of working, technical knowledge of rocks and minerals, but she almost interrupts her clear descriptions of the minerals to tell the reader how stupid methphysicists are. My guess is she's locked into a particular religious dogma that doesn't allow for free thought. Hence, the title is misleading. That which is sacred to some is soundly mocked. At the same time, the information about the minerals is excellent and the photographs are beautiful. Guess it's true - that which we fear most in ourselves, we mock most in others. Maybe she's a closet shaman!"
3,Author defeats her own purpose,She hates Crystal healing. She goes to great lengths to prove and explain why it is all bunk . She details every spiritual and magical purpose a great many stones have ever been used for and therefore when you ignore her heavy handed diatribes this is a pretty good guide for crystal healers to use for finding stone properties. She is so eager to debunk crystal healing that her work inadvertantly validates it. I reccomend this book .Its not a first book for an aspiring crystal healer but its a tangy addition to a crystal book library
2,A great disappointment,"This could have been a very excellent book but the author spends way too much time beating a dead horse. To her ""facts"" are only what can be measured by machine and everything else is ""fallacy"". While she is very knowledgable on the stones themselves, her debunking of the myths seems to center around information from questional books proporting to give the history of Atlantis and Mu. Information comming from a time before the discovery of modern medicine are also held up for ridicule. If the author had stuck with what she obviously knows and stayed off the editorial asides, this book would rate 5 stars."
3,Deco Grate,Perfect for my intention; decoration. I purchased this with a faux set of light-up fire wood and they look amazing together. And the price was the best part!
5,Cool Product!!,This is a really fun fitness tool to have around while watching TV. It is definitely not strenuous but challenging at the same time. Would definitely recommend.
5,Essential Reading for the Nutritionally Informed,"Dr. Erasmus does an excellent job of laying out the facts concerning the important role fats play in our overall quality of life. Those of us in America have been supplied with much mis-information by those seeking monetary gain at the expense of the health of the people. We have become 'Fat' conscience and prey for the greedy 'food' manufactures who have capitalized on ignorance. Dr. Erasmus does an excellent job in denouncing the myths about fats in the diet, pointing us to the well documented truth of the vital role 'good fats' plan in our body and the harmful effects of the highly processed fats. This book is an excellent resource manual that will not collect dust in the library of those truly interested in optimal health."
1,This book is loaded with misinformation,"I can only reccomend this book to those doing research into how we are being mislead. If you're new to this topic, do not start here. Instead, read Know Your Fats: The Complete Primer for Understanding the Nutrition of Fats, Oils and Cholesterol, and/or watch The Oiling of America (on YouTube), then visit the westonaprice.org site and read the article by the same name and The Skinny on Fats, along with the many other great articles about this and other subjects. I also highly recommend cholesterol-and-health.com as a great place to bust the myth that saturated fats and cholesterol are the cause of heart disease, a pair of yet-to-be-proven hypotheses supported and reinforced by this book. The fats he says heal, actually kill; those he says kill, actually heal; and his industry ties are blatant."
3,"Good product, but don't buy from Office Depot","The product itself is quite good and I would recommend it. However, the fact that it is supplied by Office Depot is the problem. Office Depot used poor shipping methods (an envelope with no padding) and also sent an item that had already been opened."
2,Nice from a distance,"This Buddha looks fine, at a distance. Any closer inspection will find poor painting. The product description fails to identify the material it is made of or whether or not the paint is toxin, rain-safe or how to care for it."
3,nice looking statue,The Buddha figore arrived in good condition.It was well packed. It looks great in my office and often sparks interesting conversations.
3,Love Jones...,"A decent soul compilation - ""Love Jones"" is the obvious standout here - I paid import ($26) for it. Wait 'til the price drops!!"
4,Good,"Recipes are easy to follow, relatively low cost to suit anyone;s budget especially today.Pictures make a big difference since you see the product before it is done."
3,NO FUNCIONA,"HOLA, PEDI EL CARTUCHO PORQUE EN MI CIUDAD NO LO HAY, LA MAQUINA COPIADORA ME DICE QUE EL CARTUCHO ES INVALIDO, EL MODELO DE MI MAQUINA ES PHASER 6110MFP"
3,Fountains of Wayne Continues,now in the tradition of Island Kool . Not bad for a 4 weeler with talent and a nack for pop ... Songs we Sang ...
5,Love! Love! Love!,"I am a lifetime Jack Johnson fan, but sadly-- have never seen him in concert. My friend went however, and Matt Costa was opening. She bought his CD, I got to listen to it, and I was hooked! Matt Costa is soulful, and passionate about his music (or so it seems to me!) and his songs are both catchy and completely unique. Although he plays off of Jack Johnson's acoustic vibe, he adds a whole dimension, making the two artists very different. This is a great album, which any music fan should pick up!"
4,Songs you will sing,"Like G. Love and ALO, Matt Costa belongs to a select group of artists that can call themselves musical friends of Jack Johnson. You get that same positive feeling when you listen to this first full Matt Costa album (not an E.P.) as when you listen to Jack Johnson. But Matt Costa is more diverse. A song like Whiskey and Wine is not a song that Jack Johnson would have made. You could say they went to the same school but they got their own styles after graduation. My personal favourite is Astair. Shimmering Fields is a close second. Other highlights are Yellow Taxi, Sunshine and the title-track Songs We Sing. And because it's an album that is so fresh, open and pleasent to listen to you will listen to it a lot when in doubt what to play. The result is that you'll end up singing these songs (along)."
5,Had to get this one....,"after his performance opening for Jack Johnson in Irvine, CA. If you like Jack Johnson, you'll love Matt Costa."
2,not that good,"The first two songs are pretty good but it goes downhill from there. The rest of the album is weak!! Lame songwriting, poor vocals, and just not good. I bought this bc he sings on brokedown melody soundtrack and loved his voice but this was very disappointing."
2,Runs out of gas,"If you like the sounds of elliot smith and the shins this may be the album for you. I truly enjoy the first few songs however, it seems to lose itself and fall into an extremely depressing almost boring last few songs. Number eight is nice to hear and may be what many consider the eye of the storm before you enter for the last few yawnings. But, don't let me scare you away 1,2,& 4 are great songs giving me the insight that costa will be a musician to reckon with in the future."
2,Unpleasantly surprised,"I, like so many who have reviewed this cd here, bought Matt Costa's ""Songs We Song"" because of his contribution to Jack Johnson's cd. His simple, unaffected style of singing was the appeal for me. However, after listening through half of songs Matt sings, I had to turn it off, for two reasons. His songs are derivative, musically speaking, and his singing style bothered me. I guess what I want to say here is that his beautiful vocal delivery on ""Lullaby"" on the Curious George soundtrack is not representative of anything (at least on the first half) of ""Songs We Sing"". I was really disappointed."
5,LOVE LETTERS,"I'm enjoying Love Letters tremendously as it is not only entertaining but extremely informative. Once I pick it up I find it difficult to put down. It's presented in an easy-to-read style with numerous clear and interesting examples of handwriting.In searching through the book looking for insights into your own handwriting traits you hope that you haven't been revealing to the world that you are 'frugal,' 'secretive' or 'boring.' I can assure you though that after this wonderful course of instruction each time you put pen to paper you'll be wonderingwhat you are telling other knowledgeable folk about yourself.Of course, a great benefit will be having some additional insights into the character traits of any new relationship that you are contemplating and, thus, heading off at the pass any pitfalls.Everybody can benefit from Love Letters as it brings into sharp focus an area of awareness about others that you may have overlooked previously."
3,Why show hose in the picture,"I guess I should have read the product description a little closer. I thought the hose in the picture came with it. Not sure why it is in there if it is not included in the package. Fortunately I have one already, but another would be nice."
3,it was fun to watch !,"i dig yoron , i just don't think there's enough of meat and potatos to this dvd . like i said it's fun to watch . i like dave weckl's dvd's and peter erskine , very educational !"
4,Nice Drama,"Jenny (Cathryn Harrison) is a young lady obsessed with horses and racing. She leaves her home and family to pursue a life on the backstretch, and soon meets Blue Fire Lady, an unruly Thoroughbred mare who refuses to accept her training. With Jenny's persistent love and caring, the fractious filly calms down, but the hard realities of the racing business threaten to tear the girl and her horse apart. Somewhat melodramatic, but certainly engrossing.Staci Layne Wilson"
3,not a great attention holder,This story is based in England and the dialog was difficult to understand. The story stated it was about training a jumper when actually very little of the story related to the training of the horse. I bought this for my 10 year old granddaughter who rides and jumps Hunter horses. She did not find the movie entertaining.
2,slow & shallow,"Wanted to like it, but it seemed to have been made for kids; it was slow, shallow & disappointing. The acting & script- mostly mediocre, & soundtrack was awful."
2,Mediocre at best,"I was very disappointed with this film. It's intentions were good, but it was lacking, in story line, in acting, in production, in direction, from beginning to end. I found myself saying, ""They could have cut that part out,"" ""They could have done that better,"" ""Why did I waste an hour and a half watching this?"" I don't ask much of a movie only that it entertain me and I walk away feeling good. I was barely entertained and I did not feel good. I do not recommend this movie."
4,Great aftershave,"Very nice bay rum aftershave, with the spice being quite heavy on the clove scent. Great if you like that kind of thing. Excellent aroma, and I've had quite a few compliments on. My only complaint is that the aroma is short lived, dissipating within only 15 minutes or so."
1,Dropped once and stopped working,"I purchased this pedometer based on another person's review which raved about its durability. It worked great the first day until I leaned over to pick something off the floor at my office. The pedometer popped off my waistband, fell about 2 feet to a carpeted floor, and stopped calculating completely. Needless to say, I was disappointed that the pedometer didn't even make it through the first 24 hours and sent it back. I understand that pedometers should be ""motion sensitive"", but given the punishing that runners and hikers put them through, they should certainly be able to survive the occasional drop -- especially to a carpeted floor. I do not recommend this product."
1,Pedometer review,"I found this product to be a disappointment, it is difficult to use and set so that it accurately monitors distance walked."
3,Good Pedometer but...,"After wearing out the buttons on another pedometer I decided to give this one a try. It's good and it seems fairly accurate but for the price there are few features. I bought it because of the positive reviews. Yes it counts steps and converts the count to miles but's that's all it does. No timer, no memory and no daily reset. It is workable but after a week with it and without my other features I'm ordering my old reliable."
4,"Good, Solid Pedometer","This is a good solid pedometer. I, do, however, have a few issues with it. First, it's noisy -- it makes more noise than other pedometers I have owned, pinging audibly when it registers steps. Second, it lacks a speaker and therefore the ability to alert you when you've reached 10,000 steps or you've walked for a certain amount of time. Other than that, it's fine."
1,Poor Product,Only had this for a few days when the lettering on two of the buttons wore off. Not accurate/reliable for counting steps as it tends to reset itself or simply stop. Feels cheaply made. Going back to the Omron brand.
1,A wonderful work of plagarism,"Francis Barrett plagarized 100% of this book from Agrippa's Three Books of Occult Philosophy, so there is some good information present, but none of it is original. (well, maybe some of the interesting illustrations) So if you're interested in the full story, seek out Agrippa (though do not buy Kessinger's version. For some reason they only include the first book, but still call it ""Three Books of Occult Philosophy"". Buy Llewellyn's--it's a beautiful production.)"
3,Illustrated? Where?,Not a single image found anywhere in the KINDLE version. Did I buy the wrong one? I downloaded the book primarily due to the ILLUSTRATED version being punted. Or is my KINDLE just to old?
4,Puts your reason to the test...interesting and challenging,"This book is chock full of interesting takes on the Bible and God as well as practical ways for affecting reality through spiritually charged knoweldge and their items. Barrett like Esuebius pulls together a lot of older information that, again, puts one in a p[osition to better consider reality and your p[lace in it with God. A must read for seekers, intelligencers, and psychonauts; or just someone normal who wants to change their mind."
5,Excellent facsimile,"There are a few BAD copies of THE MAGUS floating around, and the worst of all is one that looks quite simliar to this one but used bad OCR software to extract text, but didn't manage to even proofread where the missing symbols and text went.THIS edition gets it all perfectly. And a couple hundred less than an original makes it very friendly. Well done!"
1,Good for historical purposes only,"Someone loaned me this book. I found it a good for nights when I needed some dry reading to help me fall asleep. This is what is known as an ""armchair"" occullt book. A book for those who want to read or research such things for historical or fiction-writing reference. I bought Agrippa's works instead."
5,Desperatly needed book/best of Solomon the King,"We had this book before, and found it the best for working/reading on the Occult, Would recommend it to anyone. Can you send it to us C.O.D., and we think we ordered it from you back in May, when you told us it was on the way to us! John (the Great One)"
4,"Small, Cute Mess?","This collector's edition is worth getting for any Powerpuff fans - the story is cute, and the rougher cut illustrations by series creator Craig McCracken are colorful and downright funky. The book could have used an editorial revision, though - some of the writing is hurried and doesn't make sense, and the final scene with the Mayor has a picture that left my daughter thinking that the Powerpuff Girls were dead rather than merely dumbfounded. So if you're reading to a small child, you may have to do a lot of explaining and ad-libbing."
2,Not for the literal minded,"For those of us who have read most of the 1st person accounts of Antarctic Exploration, this story leaves a lot to be desired. The characters seemed incredibly pigeon-holed and uninteresting. The story tended to wander, and I found myself skipping whole chapters and finding I hadn't missed anything. Antarctica is too full of reality that's worth reading (and writing) about for this kind of fiction. Give me Sara Wheeler's Terra Incognita any day."
1,Laughable!!,"I am not by nature a negative person, but I have pretty much nothing good to say about this book. I only continued to read it because once I start a book I cannot stop until I am actually finished. The plot and characters are predictable. The writing is horrible! The references to the original expeditions are an embarassment! If you want a ""new-agey"" brain candy book, buy it. If you want anything of substance, forget it!"
5,Great Single,Affirmation is a amazing song. Darren Hayes took his thoughts and wrote them into this fantastic song about life...it's quick and to the point. I Don't Care is a great B-Side that was previously unreleased (and still is in the States). I Love the mixes of Affimation and I Knew I Loved You...they are just fantastic. This is a must have for collectors.
2,Nothing new about AI,"When you are reading this book you fell like a man telling you things that you already know, nothing new. If you dont know nothing about AI maybe will help you.There is not algorithms on it, only obvious info. If you want to learn real AI buy ""Artificial Inteligence"" by Rich"
1,A bad choice...,"Though I'm not nearly a novice, I found the use of this item most disturbing. The ink is NOT the same as HP's and ended up clogging the ports on my cartridge. I later learned that the poor quality ink had gummed up the print head on my machine! Though Hitachi paid the service bill, the savings in price buying this item are NOT WORTH IT! Save yourself the headache and the service bill... buy the HP version."
5,help for parents,"As a mother of four, ranging in ages from 11 to 20, and a teacher, I sometimes think I've seen it all. But, it doesn't mean I know it all. The Trouble with Perfect offers useful advice and more importantly provides the support to parents who want to do the right thing but are often uncertain because of the pressures around us. I particularly liked the chapter ""The Entitled, High-Maintenance Child."" When we see this child in print we know we don't want it to be our own. The book provides strategies to raise a successful child."
3,"Excellent book, but, oops! at least one glaring error!","these authors don't pull any punches about the pressures parents are under from our culture to raise ""perfect"" children, and I found their suggestions helpful.I would have rated this book 4 stars but for the glaring error on page 19, in which the authors mention, as an example of the folly of living for just one goal, Bill Johnson (1984 Olympic skier -- I think he medaled) being killed in a skiing accident while attempting a comeback last year at age 40.Bill Johnson is very much alive as of March 22, 2002, though he'll never be his former self. How ever did the copy editors let this one slip past them? I couldn't quite trust any of the other anecdotes from that page onward."
5,A terrific resource for parents!,"This book was very reassuring to me as a parent of three boys. (There is hope!)There were wonderful tips on how to prepare children for the future, and enlightening comments on how to avoid the obvious pratfalls. I would recommend this to all parents who want their children to succeed in life."
3,Memory Keeper's Daughter,"I bought ""Memory Keeper's Daughter"" in early November. I had not seen the movie, but I had read the book. I purchased the movie and it did not disappoint me or my students.Thank-youSuzie Huber"
5,The Memory Keeper's daughter,Really great story. We read it at our book club. The characters were really complex but made an interesting story
2,A terrible adaptation of the book,"Like many other reviewers here, I loved the book and was anticipating the screen adaptation. To my utter disappointment, this Lifetime movie version was just a hack job, and did a complete disservice to the wonderful work in was adapted from.The movie leaves out major characters and plot threads, and made me feel like I was watching a disjointed movie. That is what this movie is - disjointed and confusing. There is no real character development and because so much of the original novel has been deleted or changed, we are left with unanswered questions and puzzlement as to why some characters behave the way they do.I would recommend reading the book first and if you like it, then you'd probably want to skip this poor excuse of an adaptation. I hope someone will eventually give the novel the right cinematic treatment it deserves."
1,worst movie of a decade at least,"I was very disappointed with this movie. The mayor characters were left out, the portrayed characters were not developed enough for me to connect in the same way (or similar) when reading the book (which is brilliant, btw), the movie plot was even changed! Don't bother with this movie, it would only waste your time!"
2,Disappointed,"No need to stress the point further as I think the other reviewers have done a good job. Same; I have read the novel and was really compelled and fixed on it as soon as I started getting deeper into it. The movie was indeed terrible, and left out SO many crucial key points in the book that led to the [unsettled or not] conclusions at the ending. Actors were okay, but the way the plot was laid out; ugh!Not worth it. Rent it from a library or something, but read the book first. So please buy the book and support the author instead of contributing to the movie industry that made an award winning book a mess."
2,They changed the formula,"I never can tell if these work, but at least the flavor was good. Now they taste bad too :("
4,Really Shows Tracy's Best Work!,"Good CD, but where is his recent hit ""I Wanna Feel That Way Again"" and his classic hit ""Walkin' To Jeruselum""?"
4,An Affair with a House,"After many years of being a fan of Bunny Williams work, both at Treillage, Gumps, and several decorator show houses, it was great to compare her personal taste to that of her work. Neither is a disapointment. Her sage wisdom in decorating is what makes her house a home. I looked at the pages of this book and never once thought the house had that all too omnipresent ""done"" look that I see in so often in many decorators work. Not only was it beautiful, but it was a good read. What a treat!"
4,Delightful,"Bunny Williams's book is a delight to read. You feel as if she were speaking directly to you. The photographs are stunning. In terms of her country place, it is grand but, remarkably, so comfortable looking."
5,dream generator,"If you love looking at house and garden decorating books then this is one you should not be without. It is big, heavy, colorful, glossy and high quality. Every page has something beautiful on it. The house featured is decorated with items from the garden and the gardens are infused with decorating elements that could be in the house...Nothing stuffy or cold and modern just a home so many could feel comfortable in. I love to imagine entering the house with dogs at my heels, pulling off my riding boots and settling in with a hot cider by the fireplace............The photos are clear, well composed and send me on a dreamy trip of what is possible for my house and garden. I guess I just admire and look up to Bunny Williams. I never heard of her till I met her here in this book! Thank you for sharing Bunny....."
3,A hint disappointed,"The exterior shots are wonderful. This book is very well written-I enjoyed the written journey. Maybe I had too high expectations for this book, but there were interior photos that I flipped thru really quickly in a ho-hum fashion. I really wanted to love this book bit by bit. Usually I pick one book per year and share with all my friends for gift giving; I regret this will not be the one."
2,She finally admits to having a gardener!,"I had high expectations for the book and did read the entire thing. As other reviewers commented, her rooms were done beautifully, then crammed more full of just too much stuff. She seems to be such a collector, unable to delete anything and even going so far a buying the house accross the street because she couldn't imagine anyone else owning it! It is now the guest house, basicly the third ""guest quarters"" outside of the main house. But what really irked me was how these really magnificent gardens unfolded in front of me, chapter after chapter, all introduced in the first person, ie ""I decided to do create this"" or ""I love to do that with my gardens"". The volume of gardens is far beyond the ability for one working woman who just lives onsite on the weekends. Not until the very end of the book does she 'fess up to having a ""gardener"", a ""head gardener"" no less. Really not realistic for mere mortals to aspire to."
3,A visual beauty but...,"If you are not Donald Trump and your house is not Mara Lago you may be a tad dissapointed. I was expecting an affair w/ this book. According to the author, what every guest room needs is Egyptian cotton percale sheets w/ a 400 thread count. Ok..lol...shoot me...I buy my sheets at Target. I found the book a bit stuffy for my taste."
3,After the Affair . . . .,"This is an interesting book in a lot of ways. On the one hand the architecture and grounds of BW's Connecticut digs are quite beautiful (with the exception of the atrocious pool house that's a Greek temple made outta logs . . . .). On the other hand, the stuff that's crammed into her rooms makes for suffocating interiors. Too many dog pillows (yea, we know she loves her mutts, but please!). The looks presented herein are not edited, not clean - it's rather grandmotherly. The exception to this is the barn that from what I understand having read the book, was really more or less her husband's take on the situation and it's quite wonderful. Perhaps it's not fair to compare a low ceilinged Connecticut Federal house to a loft-like barn space but seeing as how the two are put in the same book, I guess it's open season. But this is a much better book than her latest called Point of View or as I call it, Pointless View."
1,overstuffed,"Thanks, Amazon, for taking this book back.It was a turn-off to witness such an enormous collection of stuff in one person's house. Mrs. Williams' husband deals in antiques, and it seems she just can't say no to any of it. And why do so many of us buy into the idea that old and overpriced makes so much junk attractive? Ugh.This house is owned by accumulators, and I got out quickly.The picture on the book cover looks so fresh and inviting. The affair does not suit the house. It is unbecoming and dishonest.The one star then is for the book's pretty cover, the house itself."
2,Not what I was looking for,I was looking for Decorating Inspiration and this didn't provide much. It just goes through what this woman went through in buying the old villa and restoring it. My home is almost new and not that big and the decorating help was minimal.
1,I always have a bad experience with these.,"I purchased three of these, and none of the three seemed to work as well as the cartridges by Epson. The ink stops up, and it's quite frustrating to print something out and discover halfway through that there is no red (or blue). I clean the heads, but after a few uses, it happens again. I thought it might have been the printer, but when I used the Epson cartridge, I had no problems. When I switched back to the Dataproducts, the same thing happened again."
3,Common sense and somewhat repetitive,"This is the first book that I have read by Bennis, and I didn't find anything earth-shattering in it. The book did have some good chapters, but the majority of it rehashed most of the other books on leadership I have read. I suppose there is nothing all that new under the sun. Although the book isn't very long, some sections of chapters appear to be re-hashes from earlier chapters. It reads as a collection of his essays, with common themes sewn throughout (ex: Managers do things right, Leaders do the right thing). For those that are leaders (or aspiring leaders), the information in Herding Cats will serve to reinforce what you should already know."
3,"A tape on leadership, not management.","I was disappointed in the content of the two tapes. The title suggests that it instructs on the management of unmanageble people, but Bennis spends most of the tape speaking in generalities about leadership (and seems to look down his nose at managers as lacking leadership qualities). The title might better be something along the lines of <<Bennis' Random Thoughts on Leadership>>."
2,Quick Review,"I found the book a rehash of 1980's thinking by a university professor. Japan good. US bad. Unions good, Marx good, business people bad - what a waste of money."
1,stupid book,"I got this book bc i totally love orlando bloom....like he is my faaaaav actor!! but this book was a total, and i mean total dissapointment. i guess this first time author has no clue what they are doing. they should take a few more writing classes before writing another book."
4,Great book,Barbare G. Walker has done a great job with wonderful attention to details. This book is good for the novice or more advanced people interested in Feminie/spiritual studies which has alot fo infomation and history from a women point of view which is nice to see still i think it's a good book and has some useful information.
3,Should be called 'The White Woman's Dictonary ... [etc.]',"If you're seeking a book about women's symbols, you won't find this one to be comprehensive. It is very, very Eurocentric. Unlike 'Goddesses in World Mythology', you won't learn non-European/non-Western info. There are a few references to Hinduism, but hardly any of that, even. It also seems to lack basic info. For example, in the index, there is no mention of Madonna. One would think that in this type of book, there would at least be some info on Madonna symbols and how they originated. In fact, it doesn't even cover European symbols extensively. It focuses mainly on Greek, Norse, and Christian symbols.The book is also written quite personally. I mean that it doesn't read like a scholarly book and I find that a little disconcerting. It makes me suspicious of the quality of research and the book's accuracy.Despite all I've said though, it's handy to have on hand. Just don't expect too much."
4,The woman's encyclopedia of myths and secrets,"Barbare G. Walker has done a great job with wonderful attention to detail. This book is good for the novice or more advanced people interested in Feminie/spiritual studies. Granted the information contained is contrary to what I had been brought up with my whole life, I find the information revealing and mentally inspiring. I am no historian, nor bible thumper.. I have read some of the other reviews her book has generated. That is what prompted me to write this review. I had to speak out on the books behalf. The material in her book is going to be controversial. History has long been censored and rewritten by the winners. You know, the people who only want you to know 'so much'. Show me an author who does not write with a point of view and I'll show you a phone book. So in order to wake from ignorance one must educate themselves. This book can have a nice part in that."
2,Just get the Myths and Secrets one instead,"I LOVED her other book, Woman's Encyclopedia of Myths and Secrets, and so I snapped this one up, but was hugely disappointed by it. The content and the research in it are just not as good. And the artwork that accompanies stuff is not very good, nor is there very much of it.Frankly, I think this book was churned out in order to cash in on the success of the Myths and Secrets book. A lot of the material in it is a re-hashing of that book, which I personally can't recommend enough. It really realigned my whole perception of all different kinds of religious and cultural stuff, and I sincerely recommend that if you're wondering whether or not to buy this book or that one, go get the Myths and Secrets one instead. I don't think this adds substantially to her work."
5,"I have her other Dictionary, it's great, too","Barbara Walker's research so resonates with me that as soon as I saw that this book was published I jumped to buy it. I have shared information from this and her other books broadly. In fact, I bought copies of her first dictionary for my daughter and daughter-in-law to offer them more fuel for empowerment. I hope she keeps doing more and more research and writing more and more and I have an opportunity to buy her works."
3,A bit fragile,"These easy lock rings work great. Just line up the groove, push and twist. I had a problem with one that split into two places but it was replaced by Marinco with no hassel."
2,Easily broken,"If you have this type of locking ring, use great care in handling it, because the tiny plastic inner tabs that perform the locking function are easily snapped off. I ended up rebuilding mine with aluminum tabs after the flimsy plastic ones broke."
2,Pretty good,I didnt like these movie as much as the others because its just about Sailor moon and mini moon i like the other scouts better though. The first ep. is about rini having a dream about pegusus and Serena wakes her up so they can go watch an eclipse and a big tint apears and only serena sees it and fish eye tiger eye and hawk eye go after serenas friend elizabeth but saves the day when peguses gives them super transformations. The 2 ep. fish eye tiger eye and hawk eye go after andrews girlfriend and sailor moom and mini moon go super again the sailor scouts were there this time and they save the day again. the 3rd ep. is when fish eye tiger eye and hawk eye go after serenas mom and they turn super and they stay super and sailor moon and mini moon get new attacks. Well this one is pretty good but I dont like it as much as the others bye :)
3,Sailor Moon,I dont like this video as much as the others because it's just about Sailor Moon and mini moon there isn't much about the other scouts and my fav scout is sailor mercury and it has hardly anything to do about her so if i was you i would get one more about the other scouts but thats just me:)
5,A truly humbling story of Gods gift to man,"An incredible saga of a peasant who, through channelling, becomes a healing force never before unleashed. The power and drama of this book has never, in my mind, been equaled."
5,"Great ""How to"" book","This is a great ""how to"" book on painting pots. Author gives step by step instructions on how to paint on pots. This is an excellent way to give gifts that are from you, not a store. Plus it is relaxing and fun. Try it. You will like it. Book was purchased at Amazon. quick delivery"
5,You'll be dancing,But where's her full length album?Excellent mixes of an old song...but we need more from this artist!
5,WORTH IT!,I used this case to take my guitar to Germany. I had 2 other bags so the wheels made my life so much easier. The case fit my 80's Epiphone to a T. Guitar made it there and back without a scratch! TRILLED with this purchase!
2,Not so durable.,"I recently orderd the SKB SKB-18RW ATA Roto Acoustic Guitar Case blindly,having never see it before. I ordered it on the strength of SKBs description. From the photos I had seen on the Web,I knew it was a bit ugly but I wanted a case to handle air travel. When it arrived I eagerly opended the box and wrapping, and began my inspection. I was disappointed overall.Yes, it was just as ugly as I had thought. Worse than this though, was the fact that when the case was lying flat, I could depress the top with the palm of my hand with ease a significant way, so much so, that I felt any impact to the top or back would certainly result in a damaged guitar. I am sure that SKB put a lot of effort into designing their products, but I wasn't prepared to put my faith in this one!"
4,"""10 Secrets My Dog Taught Me"" Will Get Your Tail Wagging !!","You will see lots of dog stories out there.While some of them are good and some are not, ""10 Secrets My Dog Taught Me"" is absolutely delightful.This story of NYC editor Carlo DeVito and his dog, the often neurotic, sometimes reckless, always loveable Exley warmed my heart and touched me in way I couldn't have imagined. You'll scratch your head - and perhaps behind your ear - wondering who really is whose pet.The author, Mr DeVito, has given ""10 Secrets My Dog Taught Me"" the added dimension of training tips and thoughtful insights, which are balanced with life lessons learned from our relationships dogs, and how to apply these lessons to that truly difficult and untamed animal, the human.If you haven't bought ""10 Secrets My Dog Taught Me"" you're barking up the wrong tree."
5,Excellent!,This book is so well written and a must read for any dog lover. It truly teaches you life lessons. I learned so much about my dog and myself as I read this book. Fantastic!!
1,Osborn Skews Evidence for a desired result,"This guy should go into business writing for faux news with this kind of cowardly research:1. Osborn defines an atrocity as the murder, torture, or mutilation of civilians, the wounded and prisoners. Different definitions would obviously produce different totals.2. Osborn does not count Indian deaths on the Trail of Tears (because these were allegedly unintentional.) Probably looked at old US Army documentation, go figure.3. However, he does count episodes of post-mortem mutilation, even of combatants killed in open battle, because there were more instances of Indians doing this.Osborn does a great job spinning history to his desired white man not as savage as evil Indians approach.A special thanks to Wikipedia for highlighting Osborns fantasized reality."
5,not heavy at all,I've searched high and low for a powder that gently masks imperfections and minimizes oil and this is the best product I've found - it has never caked on me or made me feel like I had make-up powder face on - plus - the compact (that you have to buy separately) is so cute and the silver color makes it easy to find in the bottom of your purse
1,Get Jiped,"I bought this dvd, to find out I got the dvd case with no dvd in it. I would suggest not buying this item for it may happen to you."
1,Horrible Movie,"This is hands down one of the worst films I've ever seen. The acting was 3rd rate, the scripting was even worse. This looks like someone threw a budget on a middle school creative writing project."
3,Flawed but Worthy,"I saw this movie the day after it came out. It was not what I expected it to be. The movie was fun, unbelievable and entertaining. The action was non-stop. But this movie really was that good, and was done vary cheap, like Crank. The story wasn't that great either. Of course after a while, the action started getting old. All in all I liked Clive Owen and Paul Giamatti. But this movie really isn't that great."
4,Great Flick,"Admittedly this isnt going to be for everyone. Rediculous over the top action scenes and more than enough ""cheesey"" lines. That being said, if you don't mind that kind of stuff you're in for a hell of a cartoon of a movie. There's even some wickedly funny (and sometimes even witty) humor. Reminds me very much of those ""Stick Figure Kung Fu"" videos that were circling the web a few years back combined with classic Bugs Bunny."
4,"bullets, breasts, swearing, irony, and dry humor","Whacky, unlikely plot, but I think it's fitting for the thrill ride you go on. Clive Owen is stupendous, Paul Giamatti is just terrific. This film has some of the best gun play scenes ever. If you love the far-fetched ""shoot 'em up"" then well...that is the name of the film. I'll never look at carrots the same again, I had no idea they were ""that"" good for you. If you like War with Statham and Li you'll get a kick out of this one. A little twist at the end is good. The closing scene is sort of pointless, but fun nonetheless. No complaints about the DVD production.The only complaint I found, amazingly, is the minor anti-gun thing. While it's part of the story, the ""good"" guy, if there is one, seems to favor gun control, which doesn't make much sense, since guns save his life at every turn."
5,Just a good fun time!!!!!!,"If your looking for a cheesy good time, then look no further then SHOOT 'EM UP. Just balls to the wall action and hillarious scenarios that seem to impossible. Don't watch if you want a plot and a good story cause you wont find that here, just sit back and enjoy some smart mindless action."
4,Fun for a Saturday night,"Just what I wanted on a Saturday night! Clever, witty and filled with action that is tied to mysterious stranger who leads the action. Another great role for Clive Owen, where his stubble is all you need to know about who he is- but want he can do, especially how he dispatches the main bad guy (no spoiler here)is just pure circus style fun. Nothing is real, but who cares? The roller coaster ride is all you need, especially if you rent this unbox style. You will feel like you got your money's worth and good wins out over cartoon badness everytime."
4,good movie.,gotta love the satire. this is a non-stop action feast. i dare you to try to count the bodies. Clive Owen does an excellent job.
4,Such crap it's good,"This movie is completely ridiculous. I love it, you paul giamatti, Monica bellucci and Clive Owen in a movie with a barely held together story, one liners that would make Arnold Schwarzenegger blush and the most unbelievable fight scenes I may have ever seen. But when you have one of those Saturdays that you want to veg out, this movie is it!"
3,Shaken Baby Syndrome,"This movie was alright, mostly over the top, but watchable. Really the entire movie consisted of me thinking to myself, ""That poor baby!"" and watching Clive Owen slip, slide and jump around while shooting at bad guys. This is definitely rental/one-time-watch."
2,Not for everyone...,"Certainly not for me, or most people who enjoy stories with an actual point. (btw worst first date movie EVER...seriously, don't do it...)Sex and violence is the game of this movie, and honestly, the over the top action scenes got to be a little too much. I can only watch so many guns going off before getting bored. What little romance there was was ridiculously fake and half left me confused.However, if you're in to massive gratuitous amounts of violence, constant action, guns, and death by carrots, go for it. I give it two stars because it's worth watching if you like that sort of thing, and as some other reviewers have pointed out, it is SUPPOSED to be over the top. However, if you're looking for some deep meaning worthwhile movie to watch, look elsewhere."
2,"Unfunny, Mindless Action Movie","This movie wants to be a comedy, but it's not funny. It wants to be an action movie, but it's all mindless action and you don't care one way or another. It wants to be a crime thriller, but you don't identify with the characters or any meaningful motive for the crime as it tries to be funny at the same time, you just can't take any of it seriously. This movie wants to be a Bugs Bunny cartoon, but other than the carrot, everything else is missing here. I gave it too stars instead of just one, because it kept me sitting through all that non-sense regardless. I now only have no one but myself to blame for wasting time and money on this movie. I think the main characters are capable of doing better, but some all encompassing force is preventing that from happening."
3,OUTRAGEOUSLY UNBELIEVABLE ACTION SCENES. Non-stop shooting. Absolutely nonsense.,"It contains OUTRAGEOUSLY UNBELIEVABLE ACTION SCENES. For example in one scene, Clive Owen shot his hand gun continously with a carrot pressed down on the trigger! The shooting is non-stop. It's absolutely nonsense. In my opinion, it's fun to watch once."
4,Surprised,"This film had some surprising scenes I actually found funny for a action film, some real cheesy lines though."
5,great fun!,"are these people with their 1 and 2 star reviews for real? reviewing this movie like it is supposed to be realistic and believable. it's a friggin' movie! it's called 'shoot em up'! it delivers! it's not up for best picture. it's over the top...and it works! and for everybody comparing it to bond and what not, get a life. it's a parody of those films. get it?"
5,Great,"Fast delivery, no problems at all. And of course great movie. A few problems while watching the movie, but I'm pretty sure that's because of my old DVD player."
3,Get a handle and a twelve pack,"Got to get drunk to find this film fun, plain and simple. Do that and its hilarious; don't and its bullox."
2,Just disappointing,I had high expectations for this film and it was just... such... a... let... down. Tons of style withABSOLUTELY no redeeming value. I really felt some good actors were completely put to waste here. Maybe a good rental but was very sorry I wasted the money on it for blu-ray.
4,OTT and fun.,"This film does have a plot, but to be honest it is hardly important to this sort movie. The action is frantic and completely silly that puns are hilariously bad. It really is one of those films that once you have seen the opening you will know if you will like it. It isn't for everyone, it is the definition of high octane dumb action movie. Clearly made as a blokes movie, although my Missus loved it as well, it ain't no date movie.Is it a worthwhile Blu ray purchase? If you like the film sure if not then you would be dumb to buy it anyway, and if you aren't sure, rent it."
1,"Shoot ""Em Up",OMG!!! So predictable in nearly every scene. Would not see again! Every movie I see of Clive Owen just gets worse!!!!
3,'meh!,"Entertaining, but silly. This is a good movie pass the time on a long afternoon. A few beers might have helped!"
4,This is a fun movie,If you are looking for action then you will get your fill with this one but don't be expecting anything serious or you will be disappointed
5,Shoot EM UP!!!,the greatest action film ever clive is ggrrrt!! in this one has comedy drama and best of all!!! none stop action!!
1,"""Deathproof"" was better than this movie","This was by far one of the stupidest movies I have ever seen. First time, I had to turn it off after 5 minutes; second time around (my boyfriend wanted to watch it) I stayed for the whole thing and was that a mistake! Was the scenario written by a 16-year-old? Waste of time - pick something else."
1,HORRIBLE,"i HAVE TO SAY THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST OVERRATED, BORING FILMS THAT I HAVE EXPERIENCED IN A WHILE. ACTION PACKED? NOT REALLY. THE ACTIONS SCENES ARE SO UNREALISTIC AND OVER THE TOP DUMB THAT THIS WOULD NOT EVEN SATISFY A THREE YEAR OLDS MIND. A GUY THAT SHOOTS PEOPLE WITH AN OBVIOUS FAKE BABY IN HIS HAND (PAUSE IT WHEN HE'S RUNNING WITH IT)AND KILLS WITH A CARROT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE ACTION PACKED. CLIVE OWEN SHOULD'VE JUST DONE A MOVIE THAT HAS A GOOD STORY PLOT AND A DESCENT ENDING. FOR REAL...SAVE YOUR MONEY AND INVEST INTO MOVIES THAT ARE CLASSIC ACTION. WHERE IS HOLLYWOOD GOING WITH ALL THESE OVER BUDGETED SCENES? BY THE WAY, DON'T BE FOOLED BY THE COOL COVER..THE GUY KILLS WITH CARROTS FOR CRYING OUT LOUD! NOT CARROTS THAT EXPLODE, BUT ACTUAL CARROTS THAT HE SEEMS TO BE EATING THROUGHOUT THE MOVIE..HOW CORNY AND IDIOTIC IS THAT?"
1,Terrible,This is a very badly written fast paced movie. They types of things that they have clive owen doing is ridiculous. The Corny screen play just stays flowing throughout the entire movie. If you like really unbelievable scenarios that never end the way they should then you will love Shoot Em Up. I spent 30 dollars on the blu-ray and it was the worst movie purchase I made all year. Not even the Perfect picture of Blu-Ray could save THE WORST MOVIE OF THE YEAR!!!! DO NOT BUY
4,Almost 007,"This is a clever action movie that's basically a long chase scene kept interesting with good characters and imaginative dialog. Clive Owens now has won me over as a 007 candidate. Giamatti is deliciously repulsive and Monica Bellucci is just delicious. The underlying plot involving gun control is sweet irony to the fact that the action is a gun-lover's wet dream. Unlike Smokin' Aces, this movie understands its mood and tone and stays true to it. There is one little tweak I wish I could do to this film: change the murky explanation of Owen's man with no name from an expatriate gunmaker's son to a murky explanation of a British agent who lost his wife in a drive-by shooting. Then Shoot 'em Up becomes an unofficial sequel to On Her Majesty's Secret Service. Clive even bears a resemblance to Lazenby, fer cryin' out loud!"
3,Explosive!,"This movie did not have much of a story line. I rented this film, and from the start I was blown away I thought this would be one of the most exciting action movie ever and It Was NOT that GREAT!Sure it had lots of EXPLOSIVE action and some funny scenes BUT How often can someone watch this film and not get tired of the same scenes over and over if it lacks a great or even good story (PLOT) to keep you intrigued.The funniest scenes were when Mr. Smith (Clive Owen) armed himself with carrots, not just good for your eyes, they Helped him get out of sticky situations. One annoying RAT in this film was the hit man (Paul Giamatti) one could easily hate this guy.I would give this movie a 2.5 stars for the lack of story line but the action was interesting so it pulled off a 3 stars. In my opinion this movie would be good as a rental. SHOOT 'EM UP :)"
2,Another Clive Own 'stinker',"What is it with Clive Owen and his choice of films to do? He was great in The Croupier and interesting as an assassin the first Bourne film, but here and in several other films (I'll Sleep When I'm Dead) he just isn't believable as a dumb, sadistic, violent guy--he's too smart to play that.Here in Shoot em Up his character has no back story; his action scenes are fine but too unbelievable to be more than 'cartoonish', and his gorgeous love interest (Monic Bellucci) seems way too smart to be with such a simple 'thug'.Add to the continuous action a bad guy (Paul Giamatti) who also seems unbelievable and you've got a mindless waste of time. And one more thing; this movie has a scene of nudity that is really disgusting and should have been cut--and I'm not speaking of any scene involving Monica Bellucci."
4,Highly entertaining,"When I first saw the preview for this movie, I thought, wow they are really making a movie called shoot em up, this is going to be the dumbest movie ever made, HOWEVER after a bunch of my friends went to see it and liked it, i decided to rent it and form my own opinion. Within 5 minutes someone is stabbed in the eye with a carrot, which shocked me because I had never seen it before. The whole movie in itself is pretty cheezy, but, its not a academy award movi its supposed to be a fun unrealistic movie, Clive Owens 1 liners are probably the best i've ever heard, and Paul Giamatti did a terrific acting job. My only concern is why Clive Owen did this since he is a phenominal actor, I didnt get it. But its easily a cult hit."
3,"Non pretentious movie.... stupid plot, lots of ammunition, good laugh","The title says it all. Entertaining, and definitely no plot, but it does not pretend to have one anyway. It is like a Rambo movie in a city."
1,Anti-Second Amendment and Anti-Masonic?,"The villain in this movies wears a Freemasonry lapel pin throughout (square and compass with a G in the middle). Clearly we are meant to understand that ""Mason = Evil."" But it is not discussed anywhere in the movie and I don't get the point for making this lapel pin displayed so prominently in so many scenes. Also, the end of the movie reveals the entire plot, if you can call it a plot, is about a man (Clive Owen) shooting hundreds of people in an attempt to assist an anti-second amendment agenda. This makes no sense whatsoever. Save your money. Save your time. Save your brain."
1,Quite frankly the worst movie ever made,"I missed this movie in the theatres so when I saw it for sale on DVD I had to pick it up. BIG MISTAKE. This movie is beyond over the top. The plot sucks, the action is sooooo far fetched it makes this movie ridiculous. Watching this movie was like torture. Please save your hard earned money and DO NOT buy this movie. If you don't believe me, rent it first. I guarantee you after you watch the first 10 minutes you will turn it off. The main chararcter (Owen) actually kills a bad guy with a carrot.HORRIBLE movie."
1,The worst movie in the history of film making,"Wow, being totally honest, and coming from me a real rental freak, this movie is the worst of the worst. I never felt so ripped off, this movie makes no sense whatsoever, how can a film like this be produced???"
1,Impressively Stupid,"Wow! What a horrific spectacle! Despite all the gun play, you can expect to either fall asleep or drift to thoughts of other things within the first ten minutes. It is fortunately rare for a film to achieve this remarkable level of suck."
1,Missed Somehow,"I am a fan of some over the top movies like the Crank and The Transporter. I liked the look of the trailer for this movie. Clive Owen is one of my favorite actors and Monica Bellucci is just plain hot. But this movie just seemed to miss the mark somehow, some way. The action was completely over the top and ridiculous which it was suppose to be but it really didn't get me going. It was just missing something. And there was plenty of over the top wild stuff that was suppose to be funny but just really wasn't. Owen usually can pull off some funny stuff. I liked his reaction to things that annoyed him but it just wasn't enough. I can't put my finger on it but this movie just was not 'on' and was missing something."
4,Mindless fun!,"This is an all out opera of bullet mayhem! You definitely have to take a break from thinking and just enjoy all of the various ways of firing guns that they came up with. The story is simple and not very engaging but the action and comedic sequences move the movie along at a frantic pace.The video picture quality is first rate high definition, right down to the pores in Clive Owen's face. A good showcase movie for your high definition display. Sound is strong too with plenty of bass and whizzing bullets panning through your speakers."
2,Idiotic politics meets Hollywood absurdity,"'Shoot Em Up' is full of those humorously ridiculous action scenes we know from movies like The Transporter. That's the good part of the movie.This is combined with a pretty strong guns-are-bad theme. It's not just an argument against violence, it's an argument against the 2nd Amendment, which is mentioned specifically.Hypocritically, the Good Guy makes use of hundreds of bullets (and a few carrots) to defeat the evil government conspiracy to allow people to have guns.Ironically, the Good Guy makes a pretty firm statement that hypocrisy is one of the things he hates.And if that's not quite enough garbage for you, the writer of this multi-million-dollar production can't control his leftist impulse to include a message about not trusting people who stand to make money.If you can shut your brain off completely while watching movies, which I can handle sometimes, this is fun to watch. But it really pushes the limits of ignoring stupidity to have a good time."
2,Anti 2nd Amendment and mediocre action at best.,This is really pretty awful. It has some decent action sequences but the movie is marred by a blatant left wing agenda and some unnecessary gore. Oh and the way he handles the baby in all of the shooting sequences is so stupid it's almost impossible to watch.
1,Worst drivel ever,"I love action movies, and I love Clive Owen. I thought I'd love this movie. But I have never seen such a misogynistic piece of crap. Women are clearly considered only good for one thing (and they don't even have to be alive to be good for it). I was thoroughly disgusted. And by the way, the action is so cartoonish, you'd be better off watching the Coyote try to drop anvils on the Roadrunner's head. I don't recommend this movie for anyone with a functioning brain."
5,This movie is a SATIRE!,"Don't know what ""satire"" is? Look it up. The reviews on 'Shoot Em Up' are terrible. This movie is a satire on other action films like James Bond. It is a very funny film, but if you're a moron, you won't know when to laugh."
2,MY GIRLFRIEND LIKED IT...BUT IT REALLY SUCKED.,"Okay, I like over-the-top sometimes. But this was total eyecandy for stupid people. The new Bond flicks are 10 times better than this crap.Stay away, Clive is taking all he can get. The carrot thing was really dumb as well. Not cute like my girlfriend thought. Maybe this is an Action/Chick flick?Monica is just a smokin' hot mama, even at her age. But seriously,this is what the Bush Administration will be remembered for. Feed us crap, and tell us we should like it..... I like Monica.This movie is for 12 year olds."
3,Bad guys by the gallons...,"Dropping like drunks after a super bowl. Gets a bit tiresome after the hundredth thug drops, but great for a five minute pick me up!"
2,It is an action movie...,It's an action movie. Paul giomatti kinda sucks as a villain. The plot's kinda stretched. Some of the sequences are overly ridiculous. Watched it at my friend's house. I certainly wouldn't want to spend $4 on it.
1,Painfully dumb,"Now, I like a good action film as much as the average male. But I have a rule--if I turn off the DVD before the film ends, the film gets one star. What stopped me here, about 20 minutes into the film, was where this baby was placed on a children's merry-go-round, the baddies begin to plunk away at it, and our hero empties a clip to make the merry-go-round go round and (once more) save the infant from harm. This is the epitome of dumb. Nothing before that sequence was any better. I suppose some people will write this off as my not being able to take a joke. Well, I'm a big Johnny To fan, and his flicks are as wild and crazy as this one. But To doesn't take the cheap way out and wink, wink at the audience. Shoot 'em up is simply stupid in so many ways."
2,Far fetched and just plain silly,"I love a good action flick as much as the next guy and was looking forward to watching this movie, but I also like a movie with some realism. Realism is exactly what this movie didn't have. Where do I start?? People being killed with carrots, more unbeleivable stunts than I can count, hundreds upon hundreds of rounds being shot at one man and he doesn't get hit once...even while delivering a baby in an open warehouse??? And let's not forget him making a mechanical baby! I was very dissappointed in this movie. I was all psyched up for this movie then found myself fast forwarding through it after the first 15 minutes!"
2,Bizarre,"I was expecting something along the lines of Crank and Smokin' Aces, two other over-the-top action movies that I actually enjoyed, but Shoot 'em Up left me disappointed. This flick still had all the action that you can squeeze into an action movie and then some but, while taken to excess, it wasn't as engaging or interesting as the two previous movies and the acting was so bad it actually hurts to watch (except for Paul Giammani, who I enjoyed).Now I understand that Shoot 'em Up is supposed to be a bizarre, over-the-top movie where action reigns supreme and things like plot, scripting and acting are second seat but the action itself wasn't enough for this movie to stand on. Nothing about it was new, innovative or engaging, it was just dumb, balls-to-the-walls stupidity and I don't know if that was by design or not. It is quite possible that I just missed what the movie was trying to be..."
1,One of the worst movies ever!!!!!!!!,"This movie could have been awarded for the ""worst of 2008""....it was just about as bad as you can get!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,just shoot out fun,Like the other reviewers on here. This movie is just fun in your face violence.There is definetly not storyline.I did I was watching Clive Owen character from sin city with out the red chucks. It was like a pre-quel to Sin City. But without the writing of Frank Miller.This will bost Clive Owen into the next action star.When your too tired or having a good drinking party this is the movie. Makes you want watch the fight scenes again knowing it's just as fake as the Matrix.
1,Fair Warning,"The only person who will NOTbe offended and disgustedby this filmis one who has been weanedon a steady diet of pornographyof the more perverse variety.I would give some examplesto illustrate my point,but the examples are toooffensive for printin a forum such as this.Rather than a life-affirmingplot about the heroic defenseof an innocent newborn baby,it is the shameless exploitationof a baby in danger to justifythe existance of and interest inthe exploits of two of thetrashiest human beingsI have ever encountered as""heroes"" in a film.The villian is equally disgusting.The baby survived attack afterattack due to the assistanceof our ""heroes"".That's the good news.The bad news is that little baby""Oscar"" now has to live with hisfoster parents.Good luck with that!Trust me.There is no reason good enoughto ignore the negativesand watch this film."
3,Buyer Beware,I purchased this 'New' and was amazed to get a copy that had the adhesive torn part way off and the wrapping was lose. It is clearly been opened and repackaged!
5,The Anti-James Bond,"This movie had SO many cool action/shoot out scenes. Clive Owen stars as a man who knows how to shoot and make the best use of a carrot. He's a scruffy, ( but very handsome ) man who innocently stumbles upon a woman about to give birth. Some bad guys start shooting at the woman and he assists in birthing her child, all the while blowing away said bad guys. He protects the child from a really nasty head scumbag -playing against his usual, amiable and likable character type, by Paul Giamatti- and the body count climbs higher and higher. Clive enlists the help of a lactating prostitute ( the baby does need to eat ), and eventually a high ranking government/business consipracy is revealed. Lots of action, blood and great one-liners/puns. Oh, and the carrot bit.....you can pretty much take a stab at what Clive uses it for...."
5,Review of Shoot 'em up,"This was a beautifully shot committed action movie with a sense of humour and outrageous stunts. Clive Owen was perfectly cast as a hard bitten man with no name and Monica Belluci was a joy to watch. Giamatti was surprisingly effective as the bad guy. The film started off excellently and simply got better. I didn't want the film to end and I hope they make a sequel.If I had to compare it with a recent action movie, I suppose that in places it had the look and feel of Kill Bill 1 but was more gripping and more fun. It also had the sort of over the top action that you might have seen in Charlie's Angels I/II. The end credits were reminiscent of a Bond movie......."
4,WHAT'S UP DOC? ANOTHER CARROT EATING CARTOON CHARACTER!,"Liking this film depends on how you look at it. This is a cartoon from beginning to end and anyone looking for realism, should look elsewhere. This is a fast paced and violent action film that doesn't take itself seriously, but does give the viewer a wild and adrenaline filled ride.Clive Owen is well suited as the carrot eating, unstoppable killing machine who inadvertently becomes the protector of an infant who's mother is killed by dirt bags and want this baby! Paul Giamatti gives a equally colorful and humorous performance as the head dirt bag.A intense and supercharged film with very little down time that should keep action fans eyes wide open from start to finish."
2,Not a bad book but very basic,This book was a good review on basic child development and the use of schedules. Not what I was looking for. I like Love & Logic and How To Discipline with Love much better for parenting ideas. I am not much on structuring your whole day and life for kids.
3,a so-so review?,"Like all baby books and many books on child rearing, this is a book to read and take from it what works for you. None of the books I've read I agree with 100%. I take ideas from each of them & form my own opinions. I like some of Mr. Ezzo's basic principles, and quite frankly, a lot of it is common sense which has been lost over the years. Though I am a religious person, I find all the ""scripture based"" reasons for doing some things to be a bit off-putting. I do like the principle that you need to teach your children to be responsible for his or her own actions; something I feel that is lacking in many of today's kids and teens. The bottom line is this: each child is unique and what works for one of your kids may not work for another. As such, each book is written from a different perspective & what works for you may not work for another. If it seems wrong to you, don't do it; if it want to give it a try, do so."
5,MUST READ FOR ALL PARENTS,I continue to buy this book as a gift for moms I meet in my life. We do about 99% of what this book recommends with our own children and appreciate the insight that helped us when we embarked on our parenting journey 11 years ago.
5,Made ME feel better!,"This book has made me feel like maybe I am not crazy and that my ""strict"" parenting style is going to be beneficial in the long run. I really do love my children, but the world should not revolve around their every want and need. Loved Baby Wise and think Child Wise is a wonderful way to support parents!"
4,Child Wise,"Thank you! We are still reading this book. Love Babywise, Pottywise, now onto Child wise soon. I hope. Our toddler is very happy almost all the time and very routined. Thanks!"
5,Helpful Tips,I really enjoyed this book. It is a wonderful and practical parenting resource. It was encouraging to read it as it re-enforces the vision at our church and gives many of the same principles and tips.
1,You really don't need to buy this,You can skip this book and save yourself some time nad money by using common sense and consistant discipline.
1,UnWise,"Gary Ezzo is not qualified to give feeding and babycare advice. He has been discredited over and over, and dropped by his publishser. He continues to publish these on his own. Look up Gary Ezzo on the internet for the critiques of this material. Don't do this to your baby!"
1,Ezzo is a monster!,This is a disgrace to parents and children around the world. How could one possibly treat a child like this and feel good about themselves. It's pure abuse!
4,Childwise Family,"It is so nice to get compliments on our parenting and our children. Are kids are far from little darlings....just regular kids who eat right, get enough sleep, and are respectful (most of the time). We owe that to the book. We loved Babywise when our Pediatrician recommended it to us for our first son who was still not sleeping through the night at six months old (worked within three days) and right away for our second one. When our second child started tantruming at age 3.5 we turned back to this book. Wish we would have read the Toddlerwise book before we got here. It would have avoided a lot of problems. Now we look forward to Preteen Wise. Really helps with our marriage too. I love couch time!"
5,Excellent,This book was like brand new. No markings and the cover was perfect and no bends or creases. Thanks for sending what you said to be true. I have received others from other venders that said the same thing and they were not in very good shape...So this was a nice surprise. Thank you so much. I am enjoying the book very much.
1,WORST MOVIE I EVER SAW,This movie really sucked.Really BAD. HORRIBLE. The worst movie I ever saw. I only gave it one star because I couldn't give it a zero. Please don't waste your time or money. Luckily I rented it first.
5,Foam Ball,"This is virtually indestructible.Our dog is a voracious chewer, and he love this ball!Love the company that makes it, too.We got our order very fast.Thank you Amazon!"
5,swell ball nearly indestructable,"Hi, got this ball (actually 5 of them at last count)for our 4 dogs of different shapes and sizes. Two of our 4 are destructo-canines that will take apart and destroy any toy. After about 5 months, one ball had a small chip bitten out, but with daily and I mean contstant daily use, they are in very good shape. We have so many because they are easy to throw, lightweight, tough and one of our 'crew' tends to 'pop' them over the 6 ft.fence when chasing a fly ball. If you've got a tough on toys four-footer, I'd recommend these. The yellow we use for 3 seasons because they're easier to spot and the blue or purple for the snow."
5,One Great Product!,This product is tough almost everlasting!I have two dogs German Shepperd & Husky both have a strong bite - this Ball is the only thing that has managed to survive everyday play. I have two of these now and the way things are going i may never have to buy another one for months/years to come :)
4,we're happy,"not her favorite toy, but the small amount of time spent trying to destroy it has been unsuccessful. It's lasted more than a few weeks so we're happy!!!"
2,did they change these,"I have been buying these balls for two dogs that are tough chewers at times. However, this batch that I bought had chunks out of them within 20 minutes of opening the package. I am not sure if they have changed how they are making these or what but I think I will be on the search for a different ball now."
2,Adequate Not Stellar,"I am a certified instructor who studied with Bob Liekens and Romana Kryzanowska during the 1990s. With out a doubt I am fortunate to haved trained with both of these famous Pilates instructors.When I first heard that Romana was going to be on video, I thought, WOW, this is great! Unfortunately, this video does not live up to the excellent teachings of Romana. It seems like the producer and director didn't have a focued purpose: did they want to create a documentary, or, did they want to creat a mass market Pilates video? It's a little of both, and somehow, this video is neither a documentary nor a mass market video. Watching this video, I wondered if Romana had control.As I watched the performer demonstrate Pilates, she seemed self-conscious and a little nervous about which exercises were coming next sometimes.I was hoping to get a first rate documentary, and a good instructional video. Instead, I bought a lackluster mixture."
2,not an exercise class!,"While I appreciate the historical value of this video and its explanation of classic Pilates history, it is erroneously marketed as an exercise class. The content is particularly dissapointing for anyone with a low-to-moderate fitness level. The rushed and competitive manner in which the material is presented may encourage beginners to take on more risk of injury than would be appropiate for their level. If you're looking for a carefully guided class for beginners, go elsewhere."
2,Practice Footage,"I thought this video might actually be practice footage to study before filming the final version, then releasing this video to the public. Sometimes the demonstrator seemed to not know which exercise was coming next. I confess that I bought this video because of the beautiful cover design. It goes to show, you can't judge a video by it's cover. Although the old film reel footage is good of the woman named Romana, I wasn't satisfied with the workout section."
2,Not Comprehensive,"I've been trying to learn Pilates at my gym, and through video tapes. This one looked good, and I was told there was a famous Pilates instructor on it. So I bought it. This video was ok, but it only has fundamental Pilates exercises. Since it's good to have a goal to work for, I found that ""Pilates for Everyone"" and ""Classical Pilates"" showed many more exercises. They even have intermediate and advanced exercises. So I was somewhat disappointed after buying ""Romana's Pilates."" The famous person on this video was wonderful in her prime. There just wasn't enough material to learn from."
1,informational only,"While I enjoyed the documentary aspect of learning about Pilates and about Romana (who is very inspirational), the workout included in this DVD was only about 5 minutes long and terribly disappointing. I wish I had bought it used instead of spending $15 on it. I will share it with friends so they can see the background of the workout I've been enjoying for over a year, but I won't mind if it never makes it way home to me again."
2,Too Basic,"I started Pilates last year and enjoy working out. This video was recommended by some of my friends who are 'in the know.' They said the Woman named Romana is famous, and that I would be glad to study this video. This video seemed too basic. Why sell a video that only shows the basic mat? Other videos have basic-intermediate, or intermediate-advanced levels, which provide inspiration to achieve more and learn more. Although Romana is probably an excellent instructor in person, I didn't see what was supposedly so special. If you are at the basic level, and only want to stay at the basic level, I guess this video could be worthwhile."
2,learn by doing? I think not.,"Yes, I did learn how to use Photoshop, Image Ready, and Dreamweaver in about a week. So the book must be O.K. However, I found it to creatively uninspiring and utterly lacking in basic make-up. Often there were there sections devoid of real instructions on how to get things done. I would say that if you want to learn the meat and potatoes of making web sites, you will be out of luck on this one. And please, ""Footprint Design""? that is ridiculously lame.Thanks--David Bowie"
3,"Good potential, but fall short on delivery....","I thought the book could be done a little better. If I wasn't familiar w/ Photoshop 7, then I would have been lost on several occasions while following the examples in the book."
4,Not disappointed,"This product repaired a completely useless, out-of-print CD-ROM that I desperately needed. It was worth the price just for that. I was also able to repair a favorite music CD. I'm now tapping my foot to ""I Can't Wait.""I did have to do it twice. The second time, I let it dry for much longer than the instructions say. It was nearly dry by the time I wiped the paste off. When I do this, the results are much better."
3,This is not bad,"This actually works pretty good. I had to re-do a disc after messing it up but if you follow instructions, it takes care of minor scratches so the disc is playable again."
3,eh...,okay.. this thing is really not that bad..i used it on a few..with big scratches did nothingdid it on a few discs with a bunch of small scratches.. took them offit you want to repair small scratches get it..i would'nt give it 1 star like everyone elseits really not that bad..plus its actually pretty cheap..if your looking for a deep scratch remover yeah your gonna be paying way over 10 bucks... way over 20 to..but eh.. think about this purchase before
1,Bad product!!!,"I tried it on two dvd's and it did not work. I did follow the steps. Not worth returning it, because it was cheap where I got it from the CVS store.Please everyone, look for better product. I am now searching for something better that works."
1,MAXELL DISC SCRATCH FRAUD,This did not fix the scratches in my DVD. Maybe it only fixes very tiny minor scratches. Don't wast your money! I will never buy any Maxell product again!
1,A waste of time and money,"The packaging of this product says that it has enough to repair 100 discs. This is not true - there are only 11 paper cleaning cloths, and you use 2 per disc. That makes enough for 5 1/2 disks. The liquids are 1.5 oz. and I doubt there is enough for 100 disks there either.Step 1 is a brown liquid you apply and let dry for 5 minutes and then wipe of with a cleaning cloth. Then you spray on step 2, which smells like it is nothing more than Windex, and wipe that off.I used this to try and repair a DVD that would stop playing half way through. I followed the directions, and it did not work. One of the reviewers said that you may need to try it multiple times, so I tried it again. It still did not work. Third time did not work either."
1,"This won't fix the Cd's, it will ruin them","This kit is absolutely horrible.First off, the scratch-free cloths it comes with aren't scratch-free at all. They totally scratch the CD.The ""Step 1: Scratch Removal"" is not scratch removal at all. It is supposed to sit for 5 minutes, then you wipe it. I let it sit overnite once and the scratch was still there.After you apply that junk, the instructions say to apply ""Step 2: Cleaner,Polisher, and Sealer"". This stuff is practically water. It doesn't work AT ALL.After you do that the CD should be like new. I don't think so!The holder that you put the CD on while you're cleaning it is too flimsy.The only good thing that I use the ""Scratch Remover"" for is small scratches on my digital camera, cell phone, PSP, and other electronics.Do not buy this unless you like ruining CD's.Last Word:I hate Maxell."
2,It doesnt do the job,i bought this at rite aid hoping to fix my game and i was excited and then later disappointed it didnt do what it said im pissed.
1,"Creates new scratches, didn't fix the old ones","I bought this repair kit so I could watch a rental movie. It had quite a few scratches and was skipping during the early parts. After I was done, I had even more scratches and the movie skipped in the exact spot it did before."
1,Horrid product,"How can they get away with selling this stuff? First and foremost: IT DOES NOT WORK. Secondly, it can make your disc WORSE.Look elsewhere - do NOT buy this junk."
1,It doesn't work and adds scratches,"This product is crap. I followed the instructions to the tiniest detail (I am a very methodical person) and it didn't remove the scratch that my DVD has and it added several more. I read other reviews of people who had a good experience by twisting the instructions, but I am not willing to do that; the manufacturer should know better how to make this product work. Following the instructions, it ruins your CD or DVD even further. Don't wast you time, money and your CD / DVD and take it somewhere where they can buff it."
1,BAD,"I bought this product and was very disappointed by it. Not only did it damage my head to my c.d. writter, it also destroyed my hard drive in the process. Eric"
4,Get the original edition if you can,"The 2003 edition of MDAB was released to reflect Plimpton's belief that the chapters focused upon his 1971 return to football, playing in an exhibition game for the (then-Baltimore) Colts against the Detroit Lions, departed thematically from the rest of the book.That was certainly his prerogative as the author, but as someone who really enjoyed the original edition when it came out in 1973, I have to disagree. I felt the ""epilogue"" chapters comprising Plimpton's ""diary"" of the 1971 training camp provided a fitting coda to the rest of the book (and to 'Paper Lion,') too -- bringing Plimpton full circle, playing against his former team, and on the final play, being tackled by Alex Karras (actually, the main character of MDAB), on what turned out to be the final plays of his football career (he was cut shortly afterward).The new edition is fine, but if you've read the original edition, it feels incomplete. If you have the chance, seek out a copy of the original."
5,"Great characters, great book","George Plimpton wants to write a book about the techniques offensive and defensive lineman. The Mad Duck (Alex Karras) and The Bear (John Gordy) will be used for research. Their first meeting for the book places the author, George, in down lineman position in the apartment of one of the men as they hammer him into lamps and such. From there the book takes off on the minds of Karras and Gordy. It is filled with absolute laugh out loud hilarity. The book finishes with Plimpton at Quarterback, but this time for the World Champion Baltimore Colts. Insights to hall of famers Johnny Unitas and Bubba Smith are must reading for football historians. (Smith at a party trying to teach a myna bird his name, ""Bubba, Bubba, Bubba""). One also gets introduced to Bob Irsay who dismantles the team. It is a hint of things to come----a move to Indianapolis."
3,refreshing,"put two opposites together add in a kid,and you have three fugitives.i liked this movie,lots of funny scenes,and interaction.i like nick nolte and he does a great job of acting in this movie."
1,"Three Fugitives,83hours til dawn and alias.",Iam not at all happy that i could not watch this product the three fugitives and 83 hours til dawn and am unable to buy this product in Australia. I think it suck that dvds have region departments and can only be watched in some countries People should be able to buy a product and be able to watch it. The sooner a dvd comes out that is able to be watched in all countries the better.
3,OK; same 'ol,"nothing new here. Re-hash of the same old stories, although the beginning (10 mins or so) is funny. But this movie ends with a thud"
5,Great comedy movie,"I must have watched this movie about 8 times, it's a very funny movie, from beginning to end, it keeps you entertained with some great laughs along the way. This is another classic movie, pick it up today if you don't already own it. :)"
5,the best!!!!!!,"its a heart-felt comedy for everybody children and adults. martin short and nick nolte are the funniest together and have great chemistry.and the little girl who plays meg is just adorable you just fall in love w\her.i highly recommend it for anybody thats into a good old comedy,and mainly if you're a big fan of martin it makes it all worth it!!!!!!!"
5,All time Best...,This is the all times top comedy for me. It leaves me rolling on the floor with laughter.
5,what a surprise.,"I went to see this movie when it first came out, I was laughing at the trailers, so I figured what the heck. I was very pleasantly surprised, it was very funny, very touching and one of my most favorite movies. However, I could not find it on netflix, so, I decided to search here, and Voi'la. Here it is, and I am very happy, you won't be disappointed."
4,Very Funny,"Another 80s movie full of funny situations and feelings. The only bad part is the dated score, but since the movie itself is old this is forgivable. Very funny film"
3,I didn't use it.,"Julia's Kitchen Wisdom: I bought this as a gift for someone, so I cannot really rate it, which is why I gave it a 3."
5,JULIA CHILD,"I'm pretty sure a lady of her beauty (sarcasm) must not need to depend on her cooking to land her a husband, but for some reason she does and she does it very well. By the way whats with her always drinking on her shows, I mean its only a half an hour can't she wait?"
5,Very practical but I prefer the book,"I use this hard copy of this book all the time, so I thought I'd try the Kindle version. I love the book and prefer it to the Kindle. It's a nice compilation of practical information."
5,The wisdom I needed,"I love this book, I needed a few more ideas as to how to perfect her famouse Beef Bourguinon, I have made it a few time and it was missing something. This was the answer I was waiting for. This book also has a lot of her great recipes. This would be a great resonable book to give as a gift."
4,Julia's Kitchen Wisdom,A little book with lots of good basic information. The one thing I was glad to learn was how to handle salad greens.
3,I was a bit dissapointed...,"This book is fairly comfortable to read and well cross referenced. However, I expected more from it after reading the reviews. Most of the topics covered are plain common sense while cooking that I learned from my parents and working in various food environments. This book does however provide valuable advice to people who haven't spent a lot of time in the kitchen, or to those who want to try cooking unfamiliar foods. I did get some valuable tips from this book, and some of the basic recipes are good places to start."
5,"Julia's ""how too"" for dummies","I felt like a ""chef"" using this little book. My cookingis always accompanied with Tums for the tummy. It wasworth the price for the bread making alone. Thank you Julia for sharingyour gift of cooking."
4,a nice follow up from Mastering the art of french cooking,"If you read or used the 2 volumn book, this is a nice reminder to use some of her good receipes again. nice book for beginers...."
4,a good general reference,"I wasn't quite as enthralled as other reviewers, but perhaps that has more to do with my recent infatuation with Cook's Illustrated Magazine which I think is the most incredible reference around -- they have a book also called The Best Recipe. To me, that book is more of a general reference than Child's. Still, this book has lots of general recipes and techniques that make it a good reference book to have around if you just want to know at what temperature to roast a duck and for how long.Maybe this is an odd gripe, but there were some pretty fancy recipes here for a basic reference. I found the meat and potato stuff very helpful, but the advanced dishes way beyond what I'm capable of. I also would have liked more pictures of some of the things she described (Cook's Illustrated is the BEST) -- from her description of how to shake the omelet pan, I needed a visual. If you like to book, this is a good book to have around, but don't miss The Best Recipe either."
4,Great!,This product is worth it every penny. I did get a 2mpg increase in the city incase your wondering and 5mpg on the highway. Great sound at wide open throttle. cant really tell if there is a power gain unless you get the exhaust kit to.
2,Get Performance but TOO MUCH NOISE,I like K&N products and had one of their kits on my '98 Durango. It worked great. I decided to put this on my '07 Ram Hemi. Big mistake. The noise level of this design is ridiculously LOUD. I tried it for 4 days and took it off. I went with their replacement filter instead. Returning it was no problem.
5,Pleased,I am very pleased with this product particularly with the price. I had it installed since I am not the most mechanically inclined. Right off the bat the performance was kicked way up(2007 Ram with Hemi)The noise sounds like a big cat purring. My mileage has increadsed by almost 4 miles a gallon but that could be that I also installed an air raid throttle body extension as well.With the overall performance plus the price I could not be happier with this product.
1,Loud,"Seams like it should work, and add Horse Power! It didn't do anything but add lots of noise for me. I couldn't tell any difference in power. It did rattle everything on my truck as it is very loud. Returned to Amazon without issue. Amazon rocks!"
1,Save your money.,"The kit was delivered in a couple days. Many thanks for processing my order so fast.The kit was easy to install. It took about 2 hours to remove and install the kit.The kit gave the engine a more powerful sound and that was about it. I was hoping to get a little better gas mileage from my 2005 Ram 1500 5.7 Hemi truck. Before I installed the kit, I did a run down the highway. Reset my mpg after I got to 60mhp and ran for 25 miles. Did the same thing after installing the kit and I lost 2 tens of mpg. Both runs were with a full tank of gas and used the cruise control.I really can't see any improvements in the performance of my truck."
5,Question?,"Has anyone had a check engine light come on after installing this cold air intake? Just for the record, I don't have one of these items. I am just curious to see the responses before I buy one. Thanks in advance."
5,Vetscription- No More Furballs!!,This stuff is great!! My cat loves it and I love never having to clean up furballs! Hurray!
5,Very nice formula,My cats like this and it's a nice formulation - not too thick and not runny like some other brands. Thank you!
5,fish flavor....,"my cat bobo only likes the fish flavor, but he goes crazy over it! he licks the treatment off my fingers at night before our bedtime."
1,Poorly written,"Poorly written book. Little continuity, small diagrams, too much information thrown at you on each page. Not well organized. Good for research maybe, NOT as a text book."
5,An excellent guide,"This book offers an excellent guide for students starting out on their university writing careers. It covers everything from getting started, to voice, to structuring essays of different genres. If you want to know how to write an evocative descriptive essay, or a clear process essay, or how to go about preparing your research paper, this book will help you with its clear, friendly advice. It also covers such issues as writing effective sentences, how to document your work, and choosing the right words for your essay. Its many TIP! sections scattered throughout the book provide small bites of practical advice that you can take in at a glance.Overall, ""Here's How To Write Well"" is short enough to be accessible--and to make an excellent writing guide for its price."
4,good book,"Good book, it does its job. If you are looking for an intense writing book go with Diana Hacker. This book gives brief outlines of citations and grammar."
3,"Please, do me a favor...","If you want to make me crack up laughing like I did just a few moments ago (whew, good stuff) please do me the favor of watching the first movie of The Hunchback of Notre dame... witness the amazing content and be blown away by the ""epic-ness"" ... then, shortly afterwards, please proceed to watch the second version (this one.)I'm aware of the rarity in sequels meeting up to the expectations of the first.. but no.. this one is special. You won't understand until you follow the instructions.HAHAHAHAAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHHAH3 stars just for making me laugh.Oh yeah, and the SONGS ! The SONGS! hahaahahahahah"
1,As bad as they say...,"This movie is as bad (or worse) than everyone has said. the animation is shoddy, and the storyline is boring. If you are looking for a good cartoon... look elsewhere. You'd be throwing your money away on this one."
1,Artless and Cheap,"This is an apparent exercise to try and give the cash cow more hay. It does a great injustice to the first feature which was far superior in all aspects of film making. The story is weak, the animation is uninspiring and the characters are stale... A disappointment."
1,Certainly Doesn't Compare with the First,"Okay, I love the Hunchback of Notre Dame...one, that is. I rented this movie from my local library, and was so glad that I didn't actually pay money even to rent it. I looked on the back, and it said there was only a runtime of about 68 minutes. That told me something right there. The movie has no plot, no evident storyline, and the animation is just awful. I'm not an expert or anything, but I've noticed that a lot of direct to video sequels share this quality. If you're looking for a villain as good as Frollo, do not expect it from this movie. The first movie is always the best!"
1,STRIKE 2,"THE FIRST ONE WAS BAD BUT HAD GOOD ANIMATION.THIS ONE HAS BAD MUSIC,ANIMATION,STORYLINE ETC...QUASIMODO IS UGLIER THAN EVER, AND ZEPHYR(WHAT'S UP WITH HIS NAME) LOOKS NOTHING LIKE ESMERELDA!!"
3,An okay film.,"I liked The Hunchback of Notre Dame II as a whole. Of course, the animation was much worse than in the first film, but the voices were good. I also liked the songs.Again, Quasimodo was a very appealing character, and I liked his warm friendship with Zephyr. Madellaine was nice, but at first, I thought she was too insecure. Sarousch was definitely the stupidest Disney villain ever."
1,"Haven't received the package, Where is the movie?","I am still waiting for this package. I don't know what happen, but has not arrived.The Hunchback of Notre Dame II"
3,"Not as good as the original, but still good","What is wrong with you people? This movie isn't all THAT bad. True, it may not be the same as the original, but I still like it nonetheless. And my dad, who is rather choosy when it comes to movies, also likes this movie. My brothers and sisters, and even my best friend, love this movie as well.The animation could be slightly better, and the music may not have the same grip on you as the music from the original, but who cares? Who says movies have to be the same all the time?So come on, people, quit your complaining and cut Disney some slack. There are worse movies out there than this one, you know."
3,Buy on VHS,"I thought this was a very good story, but the story wasn't as good as the first. There was no action or adventure, only romance.(A lot of kids will flinch at the mushy parts).I was glad with the happy ending, though. I was dissapointed with this movie a little. None the special features are good! If you want to buy it, buy it on VHS, there is no point of getting it on DVD. Save your money!!"
3,Wrong amazon title,"The actual title ""Blutige Erdbeeren"". Please see picture. It is German VHS in Pal system. Not compatible with USA players."
1,Don't buy this book!,"This book was written by a ""trained geologist"", and purports to teach the basics of ancient Egyptian and Mayan hieroglyphs. I can't comment on the Mayan section (which is very small), but the Egyptian section is woeful.As a trained Egyptologist, I have often thought the Teach Yourself series should have a volume on Egyptian HIEROGLYPHS (NOT hieroglyphics!), so I grabbed this when I saw it. It is hopeless. The author has not realised that Egyptian hieroglyphs can be read from left to right OR from right to left, depending on which way the signs face. Therefore he has transliterated all his examples backwards.DUH! BASIC mistake.There are other mistakes in the book. If you want to learn to read Egyptian hieroglyphs, read Collier & Manley's How to Read Egyptian Hieroglyphs: A Step-by-Step Guide To Teach Yourself.Teach Yourself Books did not do themselves a favour by publishing Ron Bonewitz's book."
4,Review of Gurney's 'Hittites',"This is a solid, if somewhat outdated, history of the Hittite culture. Gurney covers a vareity of basic themes: language, religion, government, social structure, etc. The pictures are old, black-and-white photographs, and the writing isn't too interesting, but this would be great for basic research."
2,Wrong item description,"I ordered this item and received Fish Oil + Omega-3 softgels with no Omega 6. The size is correct, 1200mg fish oil... of which 360mg is Omega-3 fatty acids. And, the bottle is actually 20% more free, so it's 120 softgels not 100. I will keep these to replace the comparable tablets I already have, but the item is not as described."
5,The price was great,"I give my dogs fish oil as well as myself. Finding a great price is wonderful. One of my dogs takes 7 pills a day and this has helped his allergies. He was losing his hair, licking and biting himself. This has been reversed. The website was very prompt in answering my questions."
5,Great purchase!,"My two-month-old daughter loved this from the moment we put it together and put her under it. She will play by batting at the toys and loves to watch the lights dance. The toy will amuse her for at least 20 minutes. I'm not sure how she'll enjoy it as it converts to the other uses, but it was well worth the money for the use we're getting out of it now.Also easy to assemble!"
3,Not as advertised,"We got this for our son when he was about 3-4 months old, hoping to entertain him for a while. We really don't like the music on this toy. The music (all 3 settings) has an incessant reggae beat, which makes it hard to recognize any of the songs. Then, on setting 3 (the ""piano mode"")the ""ad copy"" makes it seem like the child can just press the keys & play, which isn't true. There is an underlying (very loud!) music playing which is very distracting. My son was also able to pull this toy on top of himself, and to pull the hanging toys off the hangers. Now that he is almost 10 months, he does enjoy rocking on the rocking feature, but I'm still disappointed that Fisher-Price couldn't have designed the piano more sensibly."
3,Fun for a while...,"My daughter got a lot of use out of this when she was 3-4m old, the lights and hanging toys kept her attention long enough for me to take a shower. Now that she is almost 6m old she has gotten kind of bored with it and is more intersted in rolling around than playing with it. I will see how she likes it when she can sit up and use the piano part by itself, and then use it like a rocking toy. There seems to be a bit of a gap between phases of this toy when she is bored with one stage and not quite ready for the next. The quality is good though and I don't doubt it will last through all the stages."
2,"9 month old says, not so great.",We adopted a baby and got this toy as a present. My baby is 9 months old and she isn't interested in this toy. The buttons are hard to push and the music quality isn't that good. The 2 swinging toys that hang from it are uninteresting to her. I'm waiting to see if she likes it better when she can sit on it. Right now this toy is a dud.
3,something need to be attentioned for the toy,"It is a good stuff and my baby loves to play under it. The only problem is the hanging ""animals"" were dropped down because my baby held it tightly, which may has a potential hazard to baby...."
4,Great toy.,"We bought this toy for our four month old at Christmas and she loves it. I also like that it can grow with her. My only complaint is that its kind of big and doesn't fold up for storage, but that's just par for the course with kids toys - they have a way of taking over your house!"
1,Poor quality,"I bought it for my 3 months son, however I found the function for kicking and patting didn't work, as music doesn't sound. I called to get a replacement, unfortunately the replacement has the same problem, it seems the quality of this unit is not stable at all. I know some reviews mentioned the playing mode has a background music, that's not a design problem that's a quality problem! Other than that, music is ok, don't know rocking function as we are not there."
2,fun,"The toy is fun. I read the directions several times and could not find where to screw on the screws, and so it wobbles. I only let her use it while I am watching it in case it is not durable. She loves it, though. A cute toy."
1,Always having to be repaire,"I have had this notebook for 2 years, and its in the repair center every year for something major."
4,one beautiful gift from a husband that loves you,"a great watch, my husband bought me one over $1000 but beautiful one day it stopped.I took it for new battery, ten dollars did not help, I now have a qualified jewler looking fora movement to fit my model, which if lucky will work, My husband has recently passed awayin january and I feel bad but I wore watch all the time and still highly recommend it, The boxis not the place for such a nice gift. wear it ."
3,Badly in need of an updated edition.,"It could have been a great guide. However, the most obvious problem with this books was that it was printed seven or eight years ago. I was using this guide to locate used bookstores in the Washington DC area and only about half of the bookstores listed still exist today. Especially in today's era when so many stores have gone online, an update would have been welcome. Still with stores that currently exist, it is a useful guide for determining what kind of books a certain store sells, pricing, and recomendations."
5,It's a KitchenAid...,"What else is there to say? I saved a bundle buying a remanufactured mixer, and have not been disappointed in the least. It's been super even on some very thick cheesecake batters, and never faltered. Would recommend to all!"
2,poor construction,"we loved it until our 16 month old bit the mallet and it split in two. the plastic just snapped. not the safest of toys, so now i'm looking for a strong, sturdy wooden one."
5,Kick-ass bad,"Master P. in all is so cool. He's got it goin' on in every way. The song ""Make Em' Say Uhh"" is totally kick-ass. The No-Limit soldiers are totally cool too, but Master P. wraps em' all up! I don't know why Master P. is givin' up rappin'!? He's only like the best-ever, not like a big deal. But, n-e-ways for what's it worth now, it's cool!!!"
1,Uhh! PUSH PUSH,"This song is DUMB. Master P sounds so CONSTIPATED in this song. Someone get him some Phillips, Ducolax, or something"
5,CORTOYA PARKER,"HELLOW I'M FROM WAYNESBORO,MS AND EVERYONE HERE LIKE YOUR SONG{S} VERY MUCH AND IS SILKK DA SHOCKER * C-MURDER YOUR BROTHERS C-YA"
1,Not really a book...,"This is a collection of nothing more than newspaper articles cut and pasted into book form. Not much historical narrative, and lacking in relevant aspects of the topic offered. Photographs are nothing more than xeroxed copies from newpapers that are dark, grainy and all in black and white.Expections of the book's content and quality were not as decribed."
2,"cheap, cheap, cheap.","Although I did not purchase my two Hunter 1100 holsters from amazon.com, I felt I should write a review on these holsters, since I was so disappointed in them.These Hunter 1100 holsters are cheap copies of the old Smith & Wesson model 21 blazer holsters. Unfortunately, Smith & Wesson stopped making holsters years ago, and the model 21 went the way most great products go...Out the window!The Hunter holsters not only look cheap, they feel cheap in the hands. Even the leather and stitching is cheap!Still, for the price (they are dirt cheap, perfect China specials), I am debating on whether I should try to ""finish"" the rough unfinished edges, or just return them and try and find a couple of old Smith & Wesson model 21 holsters."

3,Pretty Boy Boris Visits Oz,"I was at first intrigued at the possibility of Boris Kodjoe showing some diversity as a tough guy in this role, however after viewing the first few minutes I came to the conclusion that Mr. Kodjoe is lacking in acting ability.If you are looking for a low budget Oz replacement then you will enjoy this film. Their are many shots that will satisfy the ladies, but overall the movie is predictable in it's genre.Of course a few turn in some pretty good performances, but otherwise I suggest renting or buying the season of Oz because the plot and storylines are better."
2,movie didnt play well,movie kept freezing and breaking up it was hard to watch it took me almost three hours to finish the whole thing
3,"The movies isn't great, but it's ok","The movie came in time. I was really interested to see it, but it's not worth the money. It has some hot nude shots and that's about it."
4,Most reunions suck but...,"This is a really good one. Four of the five musicians who made the all time classic ""Spooky Two"" are back, and they've made a damn good album. The only one missing is Gary Wright, the ""Dream Weaver"" guy. If you liked ""Spooky Two"", give this a try. Mike Harrison, one of the great blues/rock singers, is in such astonishingly good vocal form, you'd swear he was saving his pipes for the last 25 years to make a comeback. Buy this CD now!!"
3,chipped tooth,"There is something about the Spooky Two album that this band will never live up to. I found this album disappointing, lacking a certain character. The guitar sound is nothing like the early sound, it's almost too clean trying to give a light jazzy sound at times. The songs are average except for 'How', 'Tears' and 'Love is real'. They should have left 'That was only yesterday' alone. The original is so much better. I have to disagree with a comment on an earlier review - if you like Spooky Two you'll be disappointed in this album."
3,Good book for civilians,"This book was somewhat helpfull, that is if you are new to the field, military personell and police probably wont find much new or helpfull techniques here, and the author, while knowledgable, tends to repeat himself. I would reccomend this book to the average civilian, but if your military or police, save your money."
3,Good Primer for the Novice,"I purchased the book from another site which failed to list the book as a compilation of Jim's magazine articles of the last 15 years. I have read most of his articles in ""Guns & Ammo"" and regard him as a true expert in the field of personal combat tactics and self-defense.But,this book was boring to me and I read/reveiwed it in one evening. I can recommend this book to any novice as a good starting reference.More advanced students of practical & effective techniques and tactics of self-defense,I can recommend my ""Listmania"" Self Defense of amazon books and Jim Grovers DVD""Combat Pistol"" an excellent source of realistic scenarios for survival."
4,Good self defense book,This book gives good brief articles about self-defense. I especially like that it recommends avoiding conflicts and using non-lethal self defense when possible. Guns are a last resort.
5,"Street Smarts, Firearms And Personal Security","This book is excellent! It combines the authors knowledge on firearms, non lethal weapons its pros and cons as well as security and in the house.alot of commonsense approach on personal protection. Not just emphasizing on Firearms alone. I would recommend it to anyone. Male or female, young or old. Strong or wimp."
3,"Without presidential debates on television, there was a need to be filled","A need for drinking games. Well, the resulting ""Mortal Peril"" electronic drinking game is the unlikely result. I mean, do we really need an electronic drinking game? Isn't drinking enough fun? Or if required, there's the wonderful nautical drinking game from Tiki Bar TV. ""Bunnies."""
3,Misnamed but still useful,"I agree with the previous reviewer that if you're looking for an actual ""atlas"", this product is misnamed. It's sadly lacking in detailed maps. However, it IS chock-full of information that breathes life into the Renaissance world. I found the chapters on NON-Italian Renaissance (France, Ottoman Empire, Eastern Europe etc) particularly useful. Similar to a DK Eyewitness book, but with a weaker layout."
2,A Genealogical Dictionary of the First Settlers of New England,Not what I thought this was from the description and as a result was returned - just copies of pages from an older book -
2,Okay....I guess,"All right, this movie wasn't a classic, that's for sure. It really does feel like a few episodes from a Saturday morning cartoon series, and, if it was just that, it would have been considered a pretty good one. But to release it as a follow-up to such a wonderful film as Cinderella, it just doesn't quite work. An okay piece of fluff for young girls, but nothing that will be much remembered later on."
4,Not as great as other Disney classics...,"I fell for the mouse characters when I first watched it--and sometimes I still do.But, in reality, Disney's ""Cinderella 2"" is not as coherent a story as other past favourites from the studio: it only consists of three shorts focusing on the mice and the Fairy Godmother's plan trying to bring Cinderella's further adventures in a book.The animation is well-worked [...], Brooke Allison sings at least three or four songs to the film, and--once again--the mice are at it!This is definitely not one of Disney's best films ever (only released on video, I am so lucky it never got a theatrical release). I wish to others that you rent it [...]...Alas, those at Disney should have had something more original and longer for this one.But it should be great for the younger ones. For this reason I only give it a solid ****\5 stars."
3,Happily Ever After,"You would think that the story of Cinderella should probably end with ""And they lived happily ever after"". Leave it to Disney to prove that wrong. Dreams Come True is a surprisingly entertaining collection of three stories of Cinderella adjusting to life in the Castle. In the film's tales , Cinderella 'modernizes' the royal policies (somewhat resistant of the late Princess Diana), one of her mice friends finds that being human isn't all it's cracked up to be, and Cinderella's stepsister Anastasia finds love. All in all, the music is not spectacular but works for the film, and the animation for the large part is not the best of the direct-to-video films Disney has produced. Despite its short comings, Cinderella II is still an enjoyable film. It seems to work so well that one may wonder if more films about Cinderella in the Castle are on the way. I would recommend this video especially for young Princess fans or anyone who ever wondered what happened after happily ever after."
1,Dont waste your money on this!,I am 13 and have a 3 year old sister. My sister was completely bored with the movie shortly after it started and we didnt bother to watch it again. It was complicated for her and I didnt really know how to explain it to her because I didnt understand the stupidity of it. The whole movie is like flashbacks that are extremely boring to see. It has no point to the movie.
3,"Touching, but nothing to write home about.......","For those with children who loved Cinderella, its' probably a must-have for the video collection. But, even then, i think it's a bit of a let down. Wasn't at all what I expected. However, It was still heartwarming. It's Disney, so how could it not be cute, how could it not be at least heartwarming. I did enjoy watching it, but wasn't as excited over it as I thought i would be. My son and daugther did both enjoy watching it as well."
2,Lesson Learned,This will teach me a lesson to either read some reviews before buying Disney sequels or at least rent. We bought this for our daughters 4 & 6. They did make it through the movie but they were not captivated like they are with the original Cinderella. The title (Cinderella II) was misleading; it is as much a collection of stories about others characters then it is about Cinderella. It seems like cartoon rather than a feature movie. The story line lacked interest and the music was un-exciting.
2,Be careful of misleading packaging...,"The moveie was fine. Not as good as the original, but making a follow up to a classic will not live up expectations not matter how good it is. All three of my kids loved it. However, I bought the DVD instead of the VHS because of the inclusion of the ""Cinderella's Doll House game"", which is ...gotcha... a preview version of the game. No where on the packaging does it say this. I was pretty disapointed...."
1,What happened here?!,"Oh Disney! You make some true jewels, and then there's Cinderella II. Plastic, short- sighted, half-hearted. My friend and I, big Disney fans, were excited to see this, but by the end were incredibly embarrassed that we had watched it, and for the people who made this thing. Dismal stories, so-so animation, and shameless exploitation of a classic with a few poorly-done silly antics scenes to brainwash the kids into liking it. Cinderella's voice sounded stiff and fake, like the actor was trying to hard, not sweet and genuine heart- of- gold like the first.They should have cut the first two stories and put more effort into developing a decent story out of the third, about Anastasia falling in love. AND, learned from their omission in the first Cinderella and made the Prince a more 3-d character!Come on Disney! Your adult fans should be celebrating your works, not feeling ashamed of them!"
3,Great for kids; no pleasure for Disney funs.,"I cannot even compare this sequel to the original Cinderella story I watched as kid years ago. The three short stories, which are a base for the new movie, are pretty shallow, the music and songs are rather ordinary, and the cartoons and animation worst than the poorest anime movie (nothing against the anime gender). On the other hand, my 3 year-old girl loved the movie and watched it probably a hundred times. She enjoys the simple and light story (in comparison to original one overshadowed by cruel stepmother), laughs with mice running around, and sings with Fairy GodMother. I must admit, I prefer to see my daughter laughing and learning about friendship and forgiveness (Cinderella helping Anastasia to discover true feelings for the other human being), than scuttling around, and asking me to speed forward the scenes of fear and cruelty, one can find in so many present day and older (Disney) children movies."
2,Cinderella II - Dreams Come True,Movie stops several times while we are watching. We have to hit the forward button to get to the next segment to make it work again. Very disappointed.
1,Disappointed,When I received the dvd Cinderella 2 the box was smashed it doesn't close correctly. The dvd itself was ok but you would like for the cover to look at least decent. But sometimes that's the price we pay for ordering used merchandise.
4,impressed,"I was expecting a slightly scratched dvd, when I opened the dvd I was surprised to find it was in excellent shape, not a mark on it. It played good and my daughter loves it. I will definitely order more dvds in the future"
2,a waste of time ( for the most part),"ok. although everything was alright ( except the horrible gut wrenching songs) and it's cool to find out what happened to everyone, what the heck? this movie is like remember when type of movie. where there are three or four segments of cinderellas mishaps as princess. the animation is pretty good, but the plot and story are kind of weak. i think it would have been better to see a whole movie on where everyone is and developed it into one major story. it's a good rental, and actually pretty good for young kids, if you're an adult, don't buy it!"
1,Awful! Another prostitution of a Disney icon.,"I am so glad we rented instead of buying. Basically a money grubbing project with the continuing New-Disney, ""I'm an independent self-actualized woman"" theme. And the sugar-pop-synth-disco version of ""Bippity Boppity Boo"" will send any true Disney fan over the edge. I wonder...how many times can Walt turn over in his grave???"
3,For the Young in Age NOT The Young at Heart,"I rented this for my 3 year old daughter and I to watch on one of our special nights (aka no brothers allowed). She really liked it, but myself having grown up on the original Disney classic... this is a far cry. I did enjoy it, in that it made her happy. She does prefer the original Disney classic, but anything Cinderella delights her right now. Don't buy it for yourself if you grew up on the Disney classic, and think this is going to pick-up there with the same feel, the same animation, the same music (that you still sing/hum many many many years later), the same Walt Disney beauty. This is 52 years later, Walt has passed away and those who worked on the original have retired or passed away themselves. Buy it for a very young person in age, but not the young at heart."
3,Not the original but cute,"I am a great fan of the original Conderella, and knowing that sequels never really keep up with the original I didn't expect miracles here. It's a cute movie, my 2 1/2 year old likes it a lot, and I think it really is geared towards a very young audiance. The songs are too modern for this movie and the animation is OK.Overall I'm disappointed by Disney on this one, considering how long it took them to make a sequel you'd think they would have done a better job.Cute but not worth the $...find it on sale somewhere, it won't hurt as much!"
1,A sequel that NEVER should have been brought into existance,"I read some reviews about this movie and they were mixed. So I decided to find out for myself if this movie was any good. And it wasn't. All my brothers and sisters thought this was BORING. Plus the animation was horrible. It looked more like a Saturday morning cartoon. Even worse, the voices were disgraceful! They were not even close to the original. Cinderella's voice makes me shudder. I also can't believe one of the stepsisters ""falls in love"". They weren't supposed to have any emotion! Lucifer's back too yep. I know some people love him but he was killed in the first one! Overall i think this was the worst movie in the world. Even Little Mermaid 2 was better than this. If I could I'd give no stars to this movie."
5,People Calm Down A Bit,"You know this movie wasnt half bad considering that it has been 52 years since the original. The movie shows three different stories that the mice are writing for Cinderella, while not as charming as the original, what can you expect. Dont be too hard on people who happen to like the movie. I do agree that the songs do not belong in this movie, more promotional reasons than delight, people calm down... And something else i know what people are saying about the voices, but come on no one will have a close voice i bet, especially after 52 years... I repeat CALM DOWN!"
1,The First Cinderella Made Is the Original one on VHS,"Why Is Disney making all these Gold Platinum Silver Editions?? When the original ones are the best Disney Movies ever made.For The Money From Factories all over The World.Everyone thinks Disney Is the One making the new movies. I found out doing my own research, Disney has factories In China,Europe, Korea, Tokyo,And many other foreign places. That is the reason why Disney can sell the new 2 dvd sets so cheap. ] Unreal Disney has made a mess out of a lot of the new movies.Cinderella, Peter Pan,Lady & The Tramp, The Little Mermaid,Tarzan, Jungle Book,Unbelievable"" All For The Love Of Money. Having the dvds made in foreigh countries.????? give this dvd + all the other ones a Minus 000000000000"
3,Somewhat disappointed,Top marks for speedy delivery but was not too happy over condition of disk. DVD case quite filthy and disk is scratched. Picture quality ok but did not watch entire movie so can't vouch for overall condition.
1,Cinderella II DVD,"I received a counterfeit product that did not work. I was refunded my money, but it was a big disappointment for my 2-year-old. I was surprised by this dealing with Amazon."
1,"Awful, awful, awful.","Terrible. Disney seems only interested in making a quick buck these days. Another classic tarnished...the songs are so bad, my 4 year old told me ""these songs are driving me crazy, turn them off"". I'd take this back if I could, but Disney seems to realize once you buy a DVD, it's sold for good. Next time I'll wait a couple weeks and read the reviews first."
1,Cinderella II - Dreams Come True,"This was the biggest waste of a movie. Do not waste your time purchasing this. There was no purpose to make this movie except to make money. The qulity of the animation is terrible. It looks very cartoon like (yes I know it's a cartoon), not like the first Cinderella that looks like more sophisticated animation....even though it was made long ago.Do not spend anymore than a rental at Blockbuster on this movie"
2,Needs a Fairy Godmother,"This is a mediocre sequel at best. Viewing the tape reminded me of a poor Saturday morning cartoon pilot. The animation, dialogue, and plots need a fairy godmother's help to even approach the quality and magic of the original."
2,They Could Have Done Much Better!,"CINDERELLA II is a movie that is obviously intended for young kids. They took the point of the view of `story telling' literally. The mice and fairy godmother tell `stories' as to what happened to Cinderella after her big ball. The problem is - not much happened and there was not much change or growth. In other words the mice tell a story - but there is no story to tell.The mice try their usual slapstick and comic routines, but they no longer have the charm. The movie has its heart in the right place - its just not Disney to me. It's a wonder why people say `doesn't anyone read the script anymore'.There are some fun stuff on the DVD for kids - like the storybook with an interactive menu. There is also a music video and a DVD link. Overall this was a little disappointment. But it is good for the really young kids. (8-15-02)"
1,Cinderella II,"Smartest move here is to find the original Disney classic CINDERELLA and leave this bad Disney straight to video Cinderella II alone. This is just insulting. It really is. The plot of this movie is to find out what happened to Cinderella after she married the Prince. Here I can answer that for you, they lived HAPPILY EVER AFTER!!! Geez!Really people, whenever Disney releases a straight to video movie that right there should be an indication that you might be disappointed. Beauty and the Beast II = bad. Hunchback II = worse. Lion King II = not bad but I won't applaud. I think you see where I'm going here. For all of you that are fans and admirers of the original Disney classic, leave it at that. Just stay with what you know and skip this one. If you're looking for good Disney classics, check out DUMBO, ROBIN HOOD, SNOW WHITE, the newly released BEAUTY AND THE BEAST and SLEEPING BEAUTY."
2,heartbreaking,"When I was 10 the Disney folks released Cinderella for the first time on video. I saved for weeks to buy it, and ten years later I bought a 2nd copy, because my first was worn out. I cherished this movie (and still do). I am still swept away by the animation of the ball. I was overjoyed (and a little wary) when I heard about Cinderella II. I rented it first. While watching it I felt a thud as my heart hit the floor and broke. I wanted so much more from this movie. It is disjointed and jumpy, has not consistancy. It completely lost the magic of the orginal. I really wish that the Disney folks would think things through before they tarnish the memory of their classics like this. I just expected so much more!"
2,Please Rent This BEFORE BUYING! Maybe a waste of MONEY!!!!!!,This movie was not worth the wait at all! I was hoping it would have been better because I have been waiting fot this to come out. It was ok for the most part of it! I do not know if I want to show my niece this movie or not! It is that corny! The voices do not sound the same as the first Disney Cinderella. At least try to make them match! PLEASE RENT THIS MOVIE BEFORE BUYING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,A charming surprise,"Hey, what can I say? I'm a Disney fanatic. The meaning of life isn't revealed in this 75 minute film, but neither is it a clunker. The movie has a mixture of old favorites and new charmers that is bound to enchant younger children and at least leave adults with a smile and a head shake.True, the popular music is very out of place, but the sweet storyline of all three shorts is sure to catch children in the spell of Disney's classic all over again."
1,Cinderella II: Bibidi Bobidi Bad!,"Disney had 52 yrs to make a sequel and this is the best they could do? My daughter loves the original. She watched it for the first time a few months ago and we must have seen it at least 9 or 10 times since. So now to the sequel. After about 20 minutes my daugher said come on daddy lets play. The animators must be the same one's that worked on Speed Racer, and the music just doesn't fit. On the plus side my daughter likes the picture on the cover. Unfortunately I promised my daughter I would buy this video so what could I do? If you haven't made the same mistake rent it first. Maybe they can cryogenically freeze this sequel with the hopes that some day in the future they can find a cure for it. I'm sure that's what Uncle Walt would've wanted."
2,not a good seqaul,"I was looking foward to seeing this because the Lady and The Tramp and Little Mermaid sequals were not that bad. This one is poor the anamation is flat the story is bad and I dont think a child would watch this for more then 10 minutes. I regert buying this and hope the HunchBack seqaul next month is better or disney may not sell me the upcoming tarzan and 101 dalmations seqeuls that are coming out soon.The bonus feaures are lousy too a 6 minute music featurette, a four minute brooke allsion music video and a enchanted castle tabletop game which is the only the thing that elvates this dvd to 2 stars. Rent this first I am not hard to please with movies but I feel jeeped here so rent and then decide if it is something you want to own."
1,WHY??,"Why? This is a total waste of time and money on Disney's part. They just don't have that ""magic"" that they had in the 90's. I hope something happens because some of the animated movies are losing credibility. JMHO"
1,Dreams Come True- When?,"Cinderella II was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. There's no plot, crappy music, anamation is completly just your avrage saturday morning cartoon. And it's not even a movie. It's just three episodes for a possible Cinderella Series, which never happend. These Horrible Sequals really Have none these from the greatest orginals:1. The Great Feel and Charm2. The Best and Great Music3. The Happy Ending.THE HAPPY ENDING THE HAPPY ENDING THE HAPPY ENDINGTHE HAPPY ENDINGTHE HAPPY ENDINGTHE HAPPY ENDINGTHE HAPPY ENDINGTHE HAPPY ENDINGTHE HAPPY ENDINGTHE HAPPY ENDING!!!!!!!!That Is Were Disney Should Leave It!!!!!!!!"
2,Disney... OH MY GOSH!,"Cinderella II is coming close... to be not only not one of the worse sequals I have ever seen in my life, but the worst DISNEY FILM I have ever seen in my life!!! Worse, even one of the worst animated films I've seen in my whole life. The story was pointless, the animation was terrible, and the voices, oh the voices!!! However, the music was good, but I still hated this movie. Disney, read this: Please, please, please leave the classics alone! It could get worse in the future, for example: Sleeping Beauty 2?! NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!! Please stay away from this dreaded film!!!"
1,Ugh! Disney--what did you do to a classic?!,"I am shocked to find that there are even people who are willing to like and buy this...This movie was so [bad]!...In ""Cinderella II: Dreams Come True"", Cinderella marries the Prince and it's basically about what goes on in Cinderella's life after she marries him. The animation was NOTHING like the original...Brooke Allison sings four out of the five songs that are in this movie...Little kids from ages 4-7 will probably find this movie entertaining, ...I don't even think they used the original voices for the original characters! They sure sounded different. And I don't like that when I see animated sequels...I like it when they use the original voices for all the original characters. At least it makes the movie seem more believable and watchable..."
5,Great for toddlers and princess lovers,There are quite a few movies I have watched with my toddler and had to put them away until she got older because they had scary parts that gave her nightmares. This is a collection of stories after Cinderella moves into the castle and I don't have to skip any bad parts. It's also a way to get my daughter's favorite princess on DVD until the original comes out of the vault! Highly recommend for cute stories and happy music.
1,II BAD!,"Disney's not been a favorite of mine lately, but I gave in and bought this. IT IS HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE! My daughter didn't like it and she loves the original."
1,Defective DVD,This Disney DVD is defective. It will not play in our van or in our main player inside the home. This is the second Disney DVD that I have had this problem with. I bought this DVD primarily to play it in the van as my kids can watch it online at home. So much for that idea.It is buyer beware with Disney DVDs.
2,A failed TV series...,"There's a reason why this seems like 3 TV episodes... that's exactly what it is. When the TV Animation Division proposes a new series, they make three trial episodes to see how the idea will work (see Atlantis 2, Belle's Magical World, etc). When it's decided not to go ahead with the show, in order to recoup some of the cost of the episodes, they connect the three episodes together with some interstitial material and release it on VHS & DVD. Now you see why it never appeared on ""Disney Afternoon"" or ""One Saturday Morning""."
4,Great movie for our 3 year old,"Our three year old daughter loved this movie. As other reviewers have said, it's really three movies mixed into one storybook that the mice decide to make for Cinderella. This works out really well for our daughter, who hates antagonists of any kind. She wouldn't watch the third portion of this movie because it featured the step mother, but the first two movies she really liked.Other reviewers are correct that the movie really doesn't feature Cinderella much at all, and it's worth keeping in mind. But for our daughter she's just as happy to see Cinderella just a little bit and watch the mice or Anastasia."
2,I didnt like but bought for the sake of my collection,"I had seen this before I bought it and knew I didnt like it but thought my kid would. There wasnt really much interest in it and I think we all found it kind of boring. But Maybe some body in my family, in the future, will enjoy it."
3,The little Princess likes it.,"What can I say? My 6 year old daughter loves it. She has the other movies, 1 & 3, and thinks it's all great. So, let life be grand at that age :)"
1,Dreams didn't come true...,"Why haven't the Disney people learned to improve the storyline of all their sequels? Even though it is not a long featured cartoon demanding drawing that is not very detailed, that we can tolerate. But Cinderella doesn't look like the original classic at all!If Peter Pan II is going follow its example, I am never going to believe the Disney's people again!! Fans over the world have paid their price and it's time for sequels writers to get their act together."
4,It's Captivating and Enchanting,"Like one of the other reviewers, I rented this from the library for my daughter and I to view. No, it's not the original and it's does lack much of the creativity of the original, but my daughter and even her older brother find the mice telling a story enchanting and captivating."
1,AWFUL!,Have just watched this with my two children 4 and 7 and they were bored - it's unimaginative and an insult to people like my Grandfather who worked on the original. What a waste of money. Thank's for yet another rubbish title to collect dust in our homes. I'm very annoyed.
1,Shame on Disney!,Let's put it this way: My three year old has watched the original Cinderella about a thousand times. My three year old asked me to turn off Cinderella II half way through -- and told me to get my money back! Does no one at Disney have any imagination left at all?
2,Blargh,"Another one?I saw this on Disney's cartoon channel. (Toon Disney?) And I was so very glad I had not invested any money in purchasing or renting it. It felt cheap, corny, and just wrong. Why did this film need to be *made*?The film was really three different stories - and I felt that each one added very little to the Cinderella story at all. The fairy godmother is just now apparently everyone's fairy godmother. Even the mouse!While some younger girls I know liked the film, they agreed it wasn't up to the standard of the orginal stories. Frankly, Walt Disney would be sick. Why he isn't haunting the heck out of the company's higher-ups, I'll never know.Don't bother with this one."
3,Not great story,"The dvd is fine quality, but not Disney's best work. It is a few short stories - not a movie. Not aligned to first movie."
2,Dreams didn't even come true feature-wise!!,"The biggest dream in the original feature was for the King to have grandchildren, however he got none of that!The rest of the feature, two of the stories were rather good, but not worthy of being considered a sequel and the other reviews have basically explained why this was a pretty bad film."
4,I enjoyed this movie! This movie could have been better. . .,"...I believe that this film could have been better with the animation and the voices. The stories could have been told better. I believe they should have made this part II into all short stories that would have been cooler for the little kids. In all I believe that the stories were great. I feel that if Disney wants to make all of these sequels, spend more time on them! Do not just draw the movie and throw it out without a good plot and at least make the voices match! I still enjoyed this movie! However my niece did tell me to turn it off and she is only three lol, but still! :)"
1,Imagination,I agree with that reviewer. Imagination was the catch phrase of Disney and should be the motivation behind every disney movie to inspire or capture our imaginations. No disney sequel listed bellow has ever done that.Lion King IIReturn of JafarLittle Mermaid II return to the SeaPocahontas 2.What's next Snow White 2.
5,Dreams Really Do Come True!!!!,"This had to be the best Disney sequel of 2002 this year the sequels better than the original with great animation and great songs like ""Put It Together"" by pop singing sensation Brooke allison that was my favorite she sings four songs in the movie and she's very talented at it go buy this for me I'm telling you it is the best sequel ever. 14 yr. old veiwer"
1,Grr.,"Let's make this clear. Cinderella II is a disgrace and doesn't deserve to be existing. It's foul and dirty. It's stupid and boring and quite immature. Cinderella the original is better by far and shouldn't have such an atrocious sequel. This movie is bloodcurdling, nasty, horrid, and very easy to detest. It makes the hairs on my neck stand on end. The movie's called 'Dreams Come True' but for me it was a nightmare. The movie is pointless and a large waste of time, and the characters act insolent, barbaric, arrogant, hostile, dispicable, and too happy to be realistic.Sorry, Disney, you make good movies, but this one's a bad egg. It's a dud.This movie is so bad I want to vomit. This movie isn't one star, it's 0 stars. Negative 100. Make that 1,000,000,000,000 negative.'Cinderella II: Dreams Come True' is a disgrace to the name of movie."
2,Dreams Didn't Come True,"I was very disappointed with this movie. It was not at all what I expected from a disney flick. This definitely was a last minute resort by Disney to generate revenues for themselves. It is unfortunate that with their dismal picture sales they have resorted to releasing unfinished works for home entertainment. I didn't mind the graphics however, it is a series of loose mini shows with the Cinderalla characters. Do not purchase if you expecting an insightful continuation of Cinderalla's life with her prince?"
1,Owtch...Cinderella II,"Oh, man, we had to rewind this beauty halfway through and watch Sherlock Holmes in ""The Voice of Terror"" instead. The backgrounds were nice, the animation terrific... for Saturday morning TV. If you want more than that, rent it or check it out from the library first before making the purchase."
1,Another disappointing sequel,"I can't help but wonder who Disney hires to write their sequels. One would think that, of all Disney Classics, Cinderella would deserve a much better sequel. I was very disappointed, as was my 3 year old daughter. We waited and waited for this movie and it was a very big let down. Disney really needs some help! Don't waste your money!"
1,Breathtakingly bad.....,"This video definitely does not live up to the tremendous amount of hype. Though I did not expect it to be as well-done as the original, I had hoped that the animation quality would be at least as good as other Disney sequels (Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, etc.). The quality may be compared to modern Saturday morning cartoons. All the animation staff seem to be Japanese--what's the deal with that--do they come cheaper? The promised new songs were nothing more than background music--no new musical productions here. My four year old seems to like it okay, but I think it's because she loves the characters so much and I feel she will quickly tire of it. I just feel that Disney wanted to make a quick buck off the current ""Princess"" craze and lowered their normally high standards to do so."
1,One of the part two disasters,I was so disapointed (VERY VERY)it's the cheapest and worst cartoon I have ever seen from disney.. truly it was unexpected to do such a bad quality.. it was one of my favorite classics.. and they ruined it.. why do they have to make 2's! it's not always aproperiate.. it's really so sad..the animation is differet.. spirit of the movie is waay different.. the voices are different too.. and seriously if they make snow white 2 dunno what's gonna happen.. hope they make wiser decision..
1,"""Silly"" says 4-year old","This review is in response to various critical reviews that say the movie will be fine for youngsters, but boring for adults. My 4 1/2 year old daughter, who loves to get caught up in pretend play about characters in books and movies, and re-watch favorites over and over, proclaimed this movie ""silly."" She watched it once, and wanted to take it back to get a different one. None of the usual ""can we pretend I'm ......."" I strongly recommend you rent this to preview before deciding to purchase."
2,"Cinderella ""Cartoons""","I was a little leery of anything Disney puts out ""direct to video/DVD"". It usually indicates an inferior product. While I can't really call this DVD inferior, it is disappointing. It is not an entire movie, rather three short stories (cartoons) revolving around Cinderella after the honeymoon. The cartoons (as I refer to them) are not up to the animation standards of the original, but then few things these days are. The stories are cute for children, with a few lessons hidden within. As an adult, I would rate the DVD an overall two stars.My five year-old daughter (a HUGE Cinderella fan) however, gave it five stars.My impression of the DVD is: Little girls under 8 will LOVE the DVD. Most everyone else will be lukewarm about it."
1,Disney should stop making Sequels,"When is Disney going to learn that you can't make sequels to classics. They should have left Cinderella alone and let her live happily ever after. Instead, they made a sequel and Cinderella didn't even look like herself! The voices didn't match, the storyline (or lack of) was extremely poor and I still can't figure out why on earth they decided to make this film. No interesting plot and you saw the Prince all of two minutes the entire movie. Don't waste your money and buy this film. You'll never watch it again after the first viewing."
1,Yeesh.... what were they thinking?,"I, like most people, was expecting something at least on the par of Beauty and the Beast II, Aladdin II, or Lion King II when I first purchased this DVD. However, I was disappointed by this disjointed, incoherent movie. My sister and I had to turn it off halfway because we got bored. And another thing... could anyone else make out the words to the ""follow your heart"" song without turning on the subtitles? It's like the song was mashed into one big word! On the plus side, Gus Gus is still really cool."
4,My 4 year old daughter loved it!,My 4 year old daughter loved this movie. It is not a great movie but it is okay. All of the little stories in it have good messages about being true to yourself and being kind. I am glad we bought it.
1,DVD NO BOX,DISAPPOINTMENT ABOUT THIS DVD WITHOUT A BOX!!! NOT SURE IS ORIGINAL COPY!!PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT FROM THIS SELLER!!
3,It's ok,"If you aren't too attached to the original Cinderella then you might like it, but it's tough to get past the fact that the art and voices are different. My 2 yr old loves it, but I find myself annoyed at the voices, especially the songs. And, I really don't care for the new character of Prudence. But, if you are buying it for the kids I'm sure they will enjoy it."
3,Flakey Fasika,"I recently bought these shoes and I have not been able to wear them. I have a med size width, the arch was a good fit however there is a small space between the heel and the shoe. The shoe is not too big it just isn't made to fit properly. The heel is too high and not very comfortable. I am returning the shoes."
4,Athens GA alt.rock for Sunday afternoons,"Love Tractor, a band from the '80s Athens scene (early REM, Pylon, etc.), are the kind of band you'd hear on college radio at two in the morning, on Sunday afternoons. Like their musical kin, they're quite melodic yet laid back. ""Outerspace Ship"" is probably my favorite LT record. While Armistead's singing isn't exactly the greatest (apparently this was their first vocal record) songs such as ""Cartoon Kiddies"" (which got me watching Top Cat--whom they mention--after school), ""Outside With Ma"" and ""Beatle Boots"" are fun nonetheless. Their cover of ""Party Train"" is particularly amusing--think 'Fable'-era REM doing 70's funk. Of note is the song ""Nightclub Scene,"" a college radio staple. One can just smell the cigarette smoke in this one. It's good to see this one has finally been re-released."
4,A very good album,"I bought Love Tractor's ""Wheel of Pleasure"" in the mid-80s when it was new and I like it ok but it seemed kind of fey and unfocused to me, and maybe a little twee. Almost copletely instumental, with lots of shimmering, clean layered guitars buzzing around. ""...Outerspace Ship"" pulls together much more tightly, with a focused, more electric sound -- presumably the result of arranging to support the vocals, since there's only a couple of instrumental tracks on the album. Further, the tracks are catchy, hooky, and clever, while retaining an offbeat charm. 'Beatle Boots' and 'Amusement Park' are higlights, but there's plenty of joy throughout. Definitely jangle-centric, pre-grunge, but with some meat on the bone, ""This Ain't no Outerspace Ship"" is a quality offering and well worth checking out."
2,Bill Berry,"I miss Bill Berry...come on please put down the hay bale for a moment and tap those skins...Shaun O'Sullivan Berkeley, CA USA"
5,The Best Overviews of Latin American Military History,"Scheina's three books (Latin America's Wars, V.1 & 2, and Latin America: a Naval History) are the best sources in English for an overview of Latin American military history. Each book is well footnoted and has an extensive bibliography. The Naval History volume covers riverine warfare, marine corps operations, and naval aviation, often overlooked in general naval histories. The earlier Naval History is the better written of the three books. (I suspect Scheina was told that he wouldn't get tenure if his writing continued to be pleasurable to lay readers.) Hagedorn's Latin American Air Wars is the best source for air operations."
1,Don't bother with this book!,"This book is completely useless. It doesn't help a guy through his partner's pregnancy, it gives suggestions such as: ""pack night vision goggles to take to the delivery with you"". Save your money for a better book!"
1,Uninformative,The world is in bad shape if this book is helping expecting fathers. It's one lame joke after another. No help at all.
3,Pretty funny,"But not funny enough to laugh out loud on every page. There actually ARE helpful hints, but you wouldn't know where they are unless you read a serious book first. Overall, I liked it and it was quite amusing in some places, but the sence of humor the author has is predictable and old-fashioned.....in other words most of his humor goes along the lines of ""we're guys, we're stupid, and we mess up everything"". The funniest thing in the book is the part about how the chances of pregnancy being inversely proportional to the desireability of pregnancy. If you are a knuckle-dragger, buy this book. If you are not, its still ok, but there's really no need.....you can get these kind of jokes at the water cooler."
1,Distasteful Humor,"I would not recommend this book to anyone. As a woman I found it appaling and rude. My husband took one look at it and threw it back on the coffe table. I will give you some examples of how aweful this book is. In the very beginning the book gave examples of how men can enjoy the ""practice"" of getting pregnant without getting the wife pregnant. It suggests purchasing a hot cup of McDonalds coffee, placing between you thighs, and spilling it on yourself. Another example is: Ideal places to look for adoptive children - The ladies room at a high school prom. I didn't even get to page 10, I was in shock. Granted it is supposed to be humorous, but this kind of humor should not be in book form, it should be saved for something like the Man show."
1,"this book is funny,... if you have an IQ of 60","This book is L-A-M-E. I couldnt get past the first chapter. Its derogatory towards women and men. First, by making wives out to be baby machines with no thoughts of their own, and secondly, by making men out to be, at best, dogs.Dont waste your time or your money."
2,"""I thought I was doing him a favor...oops!""","My hubby and I were trying to concieve and he seemed mildly interested so I got this book for him thinking he'd appreciate the humor. WRONG!!! He was insulted by the backhanded remarks and stated that he'd much prefer a book with at least a little bit of actual helpful information. He only made it to the third chapter or so before putting it down never to pick it back up. Though the humor is well intentioned and quite possibly an ice breaker for men who have been bombarded by medical based books and looking for the lighter side of pregnancy, I do not recomend this is as a starting point for men who for the most part have a hard time relating to our condition in the first place."
1,Breathe: A Guy's Guide to Pregnancy,"I found this book to be tasteless and almost without merit. Books for expectant fathers should have some useful information and advice worked in with the the humor, and I did not find this to be the case with ""Breathe."" I perused it for perhaps 5 minutes, at which point I decided I could not give it to ANY of my young friends who are expectant fathers. They all have a good sense of humor, but beyond a couple of good giggles, this book has no redeeming positive perspective to lend to a pregnancy."
3,Hmmm...,"This is sort of weird. I mean, it has some new material, but not that much, and Pratchett's jokes tend to work better in the context of a story than as isolated works. For devoted Discworlders this is recommended, but I can't see that you'll really have much use for it, unless you're fanatical enough that you feel the need to cheat at the Discworld Quizbook or something..."
5,Unusually Useful,"I got this when I was in high school and doing book reports. Since I liked reading Discworld so much I got this book and had lots of fun making fancy book reports with it. Its also useful when a dispute among Discworld fans arises and here you have your answers! Its also full of illustrations that add to the fun of reading Discworld novels. Although I wouldn't just read it cover to cover, whenever you need a laugh just open this book randomly and start reading!"
5,he's done it agian!,"Not only is this book fun to read but it gives you a better feel of the discworld books and it works great with G.U.R.P.S Discworld (sjgames.com). Gatta love DiscWorld, (or your life isnt compleat);)"
2,Ideological bent,"The book was well written, and it was nice to see the original documents in their proper context. A small matter, though, is that the book is definitely left of center. The authors portray much of American history as a class or racial struggle.American heroism, such as in WWII, are given a few paragraphs at most. Modern Republican Presidents are seen as imperialist, even to the chapter headings.A good book, but definitely designed to present a more liberal view of American History."
1,America Past and Present,There were 30 pages ripped out of the middle of the book. A whole chapter is missing! If I was able to give no stars I would. That is a terrible way to sell a book. Especially when it is needed for school!
1,Biased..,"This book came from a total liberal slant. It tells history in a false way, and twists things to fit the author's point of view. Plus, it is almost anti-america. Everything in there has a negative tone to it, and describes the white males as basically destroying everyone else, and how america is so evil. please. America is the longest standing country out there, yet the authors seem to think our founders were all cracked. BTW I use this book for my high school AP US history class."
2,Lousy remastering!,"I bought this one to replace my earlier disc on the Bigtime label, because the sound quality on that one is terrible. Well, this was a waste of money because to call this new one ""remastered"" is tantamount to FRAUD. Whoever remastered this version must have been some kind of amateur as there is very little distinction between the two versions, not to mention, the engineer could have boosted the volume quite a bit. If you have the earlier CD don't bother with this one, unless you really want the bonus tracks.Oh, and by the way, the songs themselves are great!"
1,"Be careful with this one, it shatters easily!!","Be careful, this shatters into 100s of TINY pieces that even my vacuum can't pick up. I am shocked that a children's item would shatter like this -- I know snowglobes are fragile, but I""d expect it to be made of a safety glass that is easily & safely cleaned up, not like this. Right now I can't figure out how I""m going to get all the glass out of the carpet without going through with tweezers.My daugther got this globe for Christmas and has really loved it, it's very cute and she enjoys the music. Unfortunately it's so fragile that we won't consider getting a replacement ..."
4,Great Ball,This ball is great. It is the perfect fetch ball to be used inside the house. It is durable yet very light weight thus it does not put marks on your walls or furniture. I will order more!
1,Waste of money,"My dog had this ball destroyed in 30 minutes. ""virtually indestructable"" Would be cheaper letting your dog play with the dollar bills to buy it..."
5,Great fetch toy,"Plain and simple it works great for my dogs, only issue is as of this review the color you get is random (you can not pick the color you want)"
2,Tiny Nerf Balls,These nerf balls were much smaller than expected and thereforenot worth the price paid. They were returned immediately!
2,"Much smaller than a standard 2 1/2"" tennis ball","These balls are light weight, appear to be made of tough material and my dog took to them as soon as they came out of the box, but they are smaller than 2 1/2"". I ordered two medium and two large size balls. I'm returning the smaller balls. The medium balls are smaller than the BowWowzer Balls which are the same size as a standard tennis ball and also described by West Paw as 2 1/2"". For my dogs the medium size Fantastic Foam Ball would be dangerous. Hope StarMark fixes this problem because these balls look great. For now we will stick with the BowWowzer Balls."
4,Nice balls. Expensive.,"These balls are soft, light (but not too light to throw far with a ball-thrower) and our dog likes them much more than tennis balls. The medium size is the size of a tennis ball. At over $5 a piece (in spite of the picture, it is $5/each, not for three) they are not cheap, but in this case it is worth it."
5,Orchid Ensemble,"If you are looking for peaceful music that is out of the ordinary, you will love this CD. It is Asian style music and uses instruments I've never seen or heard before. I bought this wonderful CD following their live performance last spring at the Seattle Art Museum and have had many, many hours of listening enjoyment since then. I highly recommend it for relaxing background music, it is one of my favorites."
4,Good.,"This book prepared me for the regents in no time. It is clear and straight forward, but it could be more concise at some junctures. Barron's has yet another winner."
5,Great anti static mat,"The best out there, works very good, especially if your floors are covered with carpet."
1,Anti-Anti-Static Mat,"I, like another reviewer here, also live in a very dry region. I am subject to static discharges year round. Using this mat made no difference in the amount or severity of discharges. To make sure the mat was grounded I first confirmed I had an outlet with a proper ground. (There is a device for doing this) I then connected the mat to the ground of the outlet. Even with this confirmed grounding there was no change in static discharges."
5,the perfect mat,This mat is the perfect fit for my workbench. It is a soft mat so its not like working on a hard counter. Excellent workspace for taking desktops and laptops apart.
3,Don't know what to think,"I converted the ground wire to connect to the household ground plug and it measures ~1M ohms. I have noticed that it has eliminated any perceptible static. The table was an ESD generator but once the mat was installed and plugged in, it has been severely reduced but it is important to note I DO NOT have the correct meter to verify it. This product was bought as a cheap way to reduce the hair on my arms standing up when working at the computer on top of a plastic table in a VERY dry state. It has done that but I wouldn't risk high $$ equipment on it.Will be buying a better quality traceable product for the workstation!"
2,ehh,hard to use. where do you groud it?good to cover superslic desk though (glass)not as much static problems now that ive moved
2,OK product,"Definetely not what I thought I was going to get, but an ESD mat is pretty basic so it serves its' purpose.The listing of this item needs to be updated.edit: the pic has been updated to what I recieved - so many years later...."
2,Screaming babies,"I normally like California Baby products and appreciate their use of safer ingredients, but this cream makes both of my children scream when I use it on a rash. Kind of defeats the purpose of diaper cream. Smells nice, though."
1,Cetyl Alcohol? Very Painful to Baby.,My daughter just got her first diaper rash at 7 months old. I bought this when she was born for instances such as this. It was a pretty bad rash. I slathered some of this on and my daughter literally tried to crawl out of her skin. She was almost hyperventilating and screaming. It was terrible.Why would you put Cetyl Alcohol in a diaper rash cream? I'm assuming that is what caused the immense pain. I also tried A+D and Extra Strength Desitin. The Desitin worked the best. None of the other brands made her scream in pain.
4,Geology Illustrated,"Good condition, especially considering the age. I once designed a course in limnology (fresh water ecology) and found this book to be a marvelous resource."
1,Waste of money,"This has to be the worst CD Devito has created. (I have NYC Undgrd 2-5 + Dance Factory + Trance Session) I bought it today, listened to it once and tomorrow, I will be giving it away. What a trash."
1,I Saw Louis on Elimidate,"And I have to say I am completely unimpressed. He's a cocky jerk who will undoubtably be bankrupt before long. I've listened to some of his music, and despite the fact that some of the old stuff is respectable, please stop buying his new junk -- its awful."
2,Take some advice...,"Instead of releasing a new album every so many months, why don't you just wait for a bunch of good techno songs and then release an album with those? For instance get a little DJ Sammy, Iva Van Dahl, Lasgo & Sarina Paris and make a collection of those songs instead of flooding them with horrible excuses for songs.The album however has one of the greatest songs ever made, ""Something Happened on the Way to Heaven"" by Deborah Cox which is worth the price of the CD alone. But I recommend that you get Cox's remix album instead because it also has ""Nobody's Supposed to Be Here"", ""Mr. Lonely"" & ""Absolutely Not"" all of which were #1 dance singles, just as ""...Heaven"" was."
3,Devito's Baaack!,"This is similiar to the other NYC Underground Cds. Some of the songs may be a little played out by now...you've heard them many times at clubs/bars, but most are worth having. E-Samba, Serenity & I'd Say Yes are AMAZING. The second Cd (older mixes & anthems) is a nice bonus. Who doesn't love Ectasy & Ride The Trip??? If you have any of the other NYCs you might as well pick this one up too!"
3,"Sadly, Sadly disappointed","Read any of my other reviews for Louie's cd's, and you'll see nothing but beaming, raving reviews. I have everything he's ever made, and I've NEVER been disappointed. I ran out to the mall today to buy Underground Volume 6, popped it in the car stereo before [I] was even in the car seat.. and I hate to say it, but I was a little disappointed. I've never even HEARD of half the stuff on the first cd.. and to be perfectly honest, disc 2 was totally unnecessary. It's just a couple of songs from his past cd's.. like, ok, whats the point in that? Disc 1 does have a few good songs.. like I engineer, Despina Vande, Something happened on the way to heaven, how did you know, and my time. But the rest of it is just, for lack of a better word, crap. If you're a die hard Louie fan like me, then get the CD. But if not, and I feel horrible saying this, but dont waste your money."
4,It's good to hear some of the old!,"I understand what u guys are saying about how some stuff on the cd is from the 1st underground, but seriously, they dont make good club songs like that anymore. all of the new stuff sounds so much the same. i was so happy to hear the old songs like ecstasy and take your shirts off! they are awesome and it felt good to hear the old stuff. like i said, nothing is that good anymore, and louie has been able to take us back into memory land with the old anthems. i still bump nyc underground 1!! dance factory level 2 is soooooooo great!!!! thats like 10 stars. i listen to that everyday in my car and on the way to the club. i like devito. he brings back good memories of mine. i dont think he has become so popular and famous that he doesnt have time to look thru the music as someone said. i think the music just isnt out there anymore. DJS, PLEASE MAKE SOME MORE ANTHEMS!"
2,Sad waste of time.,"Too bad Louie Devito Can't find something new. NYC Underground Party 6 is sooo sad. It's like DeVito is saying ""Listen to disc 1...I am really trying to make this new stuff totally house. Listen to disk 2...I know you know these songs already, but I need to remind you how good I used to be."" I'm not sure if the music just isn't out there or if DeVito has become too famous to search through the filth to find it. Disc one is meadiocre at best sounding far too pop and trance to even be called house music. Disc two would be great if we hadn't already heard the songs...like on NYC 1-5. Even a different mix of the old classics would have freshened this venture up a little. After Ultra Dance I should have followed my instinct and steared clear of NYC 6, but Dance Factory Level 2 was so good I though ""Even Louie can miss once and awhile."" Looks like once and awhile is becoming the norm here. Oh well, at least he is still good live."
3,nyc underground vol. 6,"Good mix, previous undergrounds sounded better, but a good mix nonetheless. A good CD to get the party going."
4,Great!!!,I love this cd. I have been a fan of Louie Devito for years. I can't get enough of him. I recommend this cd to anyone who likes any of the other NYC albums.
4,"Love, love, love the track shoes","Pros: They are cute, fashionable,comfy, arrived rather quickly and priced just right.Cons: My daughter has long slim feet, so they ran a little big; however she ran very well and jumped high and long."
3,I purchased a copy...,"It is definately helpful to those just getting into digital photography, but it just isn't as advanced as I would like it to be. It has a lot of useful information for manipulation, but it is lacking in the actual ""shooting"" phase of photography."
2,Lacking,This book is lacking some critical insights. It doesn't far enough for a novice. It isn't clear when attempting to explain complex but critical information. It is insufficient.
3,Unfortunate cover,"The book sounds like just what I am looking for, but they are going to have to change that unfortunate choice of cover page..."
1,The CD-rom has got several problems...!,"This book has got a big review but you can only practice two problem per skill in the structure seccion.The listening part does not work, for example you can't hear the last words of each conversation, the four listening seccion don't mach with the book...may be you have to guess !, and the explanation is too dificult to find.I do not recommend this book."
4,Good stuff,"These guys have a good sound for anyone into the more popular Cradle of Filth. Vocals are reminescent of Dani Filth's but the songwriting is decidedly more 'black metal'. This is just about as good as 'Slaughter of Innocence', so if you have that one and are undecided about 'Dark Requiems', go ahead and grab this up. A good buy."
3,Decent Black Metal,"Hecate Enthroned, a black metal band from the UK, have in this album created rather decent black metal. To compare them to some perhaps better known bands, their music is almost a cross between the earlier work of Cradle of Filth and Dimmu Borgir, and Dark Funeral. The atmosphere is set with melancholy keyboard tunes and the guitars produce the rhythm and primary melody, though sometimes overpower the keyboards a little too much. I give it three stars because five should be reserved for the very few ""greatest"" albums out there in whatever given genre, and four stars for the very close seconds. An enjoyable listen in its own right, but also excellent background music."
2,Flap short-lived & not replaceable.,"At the time, this was Havahart's premium cat door because of the aluminum frame. I chose it thinking I would be modifying my exterior panel door only once. Mine has been used by two medium-size cats in a residential neighborhood for approximately two years. No other animals involved. Unfortunately, the flap has a plastic hinge where the plastic just flexes - not a pin type hinge; and it has fatigued to the point that it no longer swings closed. The factory (1-800-800-1819) says ""the warranty is for only one year, the door is not serviceable, and my only option is to buy a complete new door""! Replace a $50-$60 cat door every two years? I don't think so. No corporate integrity here.Doug Franks (Mechanical Engineer)"
4,Fairly Good,I have had this unit for about three years. It works fine except the meters are all no longer working.
1,Quilts Among the Plain People,I was disappointed with this book - perhaps I had misread what it was about. Firstly it is in black and white on quite ordinary paper. I was expecting a tutorial book but found this leant more to the history of Quilting in the Amish community. Perhaps this might be acceptable to someone who had not heard of the Amish people and their association with quilts.
3,Interesting history book.,"This is a small book, but interesting to read. It is not a how-to book and pictures are in black and white."
4,What a Gift,"What a gift this video is to the world. I am not likely to ever see, meet or have a chance to train under Romana. This video is a way for all of us to get a bit of wisdom and feel for who Romana is and what her work with Joseph Pilates was like. I can learn all the techniques and exercises, train on the mat and equipment, etc. But to get the spirit of Pilates and of Romana's teaching style and approach to life; well, this video gives us a glimpse of that world. I would have paid double for this video."
4,"Beautiful Lyrics, Beautiful Music","Everlife is a great group. I am an Atheist and i still loved their music. Their Voices are quite soothing. I love the music, and love their style. I recommend this to all people, it doesn't matter about your religion. Only matters if you have good taste in music."
5,"Wonderful CD, wonderful girls!","I have known the members of Everlife for a few years now. I met them through the TV station my mother worked at. I could not believe that they were so talented! This CD is wonderful and I can relate to so many of the songs. They are definately not an imitation of ANYONE. They are wonderful representatives of the Christian faith, and I will continue to support them as they move on with their music career. Five stars for everlife!"
5,everlife rocks,"This CD is great!!! i love it is my favorite cd that i own. Great sound great vocals, I LOVE IT!!!!"
3,soft metal,"I rate it a 3 because I thought the finish looked like a match for my hardware that I already have. I guess matching finishes unless they are stated to be exactly the same material, is not likely by viewing online. Also, the metal is very soft and pliable, but suppose that does not really matter in this case, as no stress is put on this particular piece. The seller, however, was very prompt in refunding these when I sent them back."
3,It's a good read.,"Memoirs of a Sword Swallower is something of an underground classic, providing an introduction to the U.S travelling carnival scene during the '40s and '50s. Interested readers might also want to track down ""Bed of Nails"" by Michael Blondini and Gordon Thomas, which was published in London a few years after ""Memoirs"" and seems to be heavily cribbed from it."
4,Sword Swallower,"This is a personal saga written in a kind of anonymous way since it was not a ""politically correct subject"" at that place in time. It is written in the simple and honest language of the carnies. A must read for aficionados of the old side shows"
2,Add another to the chorus who don't like how easily it falls off,"So, I'm shopping for a new pedometer now because I had one of these and discovered that I had lost it as I was leaving the mall today. It's a shame, because otherwise it's a good pedometer -- I liked the ability to change between modes and easily reset the counter. While I never did any scientific tests to confirm the accuracy, I have checked the route that I walked on Google Maps against what the pedometer recorded and the results have been pretty close. As many others have mentioned, the clasp is too weak; I would also add that I think the relatively long length makes it even easier to accidentally pull off. I wonder if it would be more secure if it were a bit shorter. If anybody out there finds mine, hope you enjoy it, but if you're shopping for one, I'd suggest looking for one that's more secure."
1,pedometer,"This worked fine, but the design of the clip did not keep it on the belt line. This pedometer fell off my pant up to 4 times a day. Very frustrating."
1,Save your money,"I paid 10.00 dollars for the pedometer and I over paid by nine dollars. Got the same qualityfrom a health care give-away.Lousy clip on, Never know which mode your in and its accuracy isalways questionable."
3,my third Sportline 340 pedometer,"This is the third time I purchased this same model pedometer. Each of the first two worked fine, they were easy to set up and use, they seemed to give accurate readings, the trim contours of it did not appear to be a bulky mass on my belt, and the price was reasonable. It is those features that brought me back the second and third time; however, the belt clip on the first two broke after about 5 or 6 months of daily use. When the clip was working, it held firmly to my belt, which I have read to be a problem with other models. But after the clip broke, the whole item was worthless. I keep hoping Sportline will improve the integrity of the clip, but if not, my third time will be my last. If you want a good pedometer for 6 months of daily use, or perhaps will not be using it on a daily basis, then I could recommend this model. If you want it to last longer, then I would recommend looking elsewhere."
4,"Good, until dropped","During the first few days of use, this pedometer was both accurate and precise---and I tested it many times over known measured distances. Then---I dropped it and it lost its accuracy and precision. Although its functions are limited to steps and distance, it worked well but isn't durable.Addendum to review: After a few more tests to determine the extent of the problem, I discovered that the pedometer had lost its sensitivity when worn in the position recommended in the instructions; but, if worn much more laterally---over the top of the iliac bone rather than over the crease line of the trousers as instructed---it became very accurate and precise. Therefore, I will add a star. Although it does not have many of the features of more elaborate pedometers, it covers the essential measurements well."
1,garbage pure and simple,this thing is not worth the money. as the others said it doesn't want to stay on. i just wanted to know how far around a loop was that i walk several times in my walk. i mean how hard can that be? just tell me the distance! i think i was over optimistic and didn't save the store receipt. that will teach me.
1,Save your money & buy something else,"I have tried & tried to see if this thing would work. There is nothing consistent about it. It was a total waste of money. I compared it with treadmill & then even compared it with a gps unit because I knew exactly how far it was. This model never read the same number twice. Typically, it was way behind."
2,"Cheap, for a reason.","This is a very cheap and poorly designed piece of plastic. The battery cover comes off only after you jam your fingers trying to work on it. You will work on it often if you want your battery to last over a week, or so. Otherwise, you'll put up with this company's statement, hidden in the instructions, that this unit is ""designed to always be on."" Yeah, nice electronics, right? The aforementioned battery cover will also break, in time, as its little prongs will snap off, and then you'll have to tape the cover on. Without tape, the battery will spring out and get lost. Spend a few more dollars and get a better unit. As far as the actual distance calculator, step sensor and mechanics, this unit does what it needs to do. The trouble is in the plastic that surrounds those parts. Pass on this one."
1,This supplier is HORRIBLE!!!,"This supplier is HORRIBLE!!!First they sent the wrong pedometers. Then they sent the 2 corect ones, but one that does not work. I ordered this more than a month ago and I still don't have received the final replacement!!!"
2,thought it would be better than it is...,"I am on something like my 5th pedometer and until recently, I didn't want to invest a lot in one. I bought this because I thought it looked cool and was a great price. It fell off constantly! For a few days I would pin it to my pants but that was time comsuming and annoying, not to mention painful when the pin stuck me! It is fairly accurate, but who cares if you are always worried about it popping off and falling to the floor? I finally invested in an Omron that not only stays on, but has a security latch you can attach to your clothing in case it does come off it will not fall to the ground. I also bought it on Amazon, but it was around $18.99. It stores a week's worth of steps for you so you can track your progress. I am in love with my new pedometer, I wish I would have invested in this one first!"
1,Reviews were good until I bought it.,"I bought this pedometer when the ratings for it were 5 stars! Now there are all kinds of bad reviews starting in 2007. Too bad I bought it in December. This is a piece of junk. I thought I was ordering a mid-priced pedometer. (It was $12 at that time). I agree about it not staying on, and even though I followed the calibration instructions, the steps were never accurate. I had an additional problem in that parts of the numbers were missing on the LCD most of the time. So is a backwards three actually an eight, was that a one or a seven, is that 5000 or 6000? I never knew. The only time all the lines displayed making perfect numbers was when you cleared it to 0000. I'll probably try a 'cheapy' from Walmart. It will probably do better than this."
2,Having problems,"I am not very happy with my new pedometer. It falls off all the time, the face plate comes off and I have a very hard time making it stay back on. The spring has now broke from the clip, so the pedometer won't even clip to my pants anymore. I have to carry it in my pocket and it is too big for that. I am disappointed with this purchase!"
2,Sportline 340,"As I search the internet for information about this device I find the common negative thread that it just doesn't stay on you. Well the reason I was searching was because I had found one laying along the sidewalk. Obviously it had decided to abandon ship. Nothing broken, just a shame that they did not test the pedometer before marketing it. You would think an important test would be to see if the clip on pedometer actually stayed clipped on."
3,"Good, but falls off / easily lost","Decent deal for money, but clip sucks - fell off my shorts/waist twice. Never found it the second time. Consider tying a string around it and thru your shorts, or safety pin it to your shorts.Worked great, near as I could tell. Recommended settings method wasn't accurate - much better method: run a known distance, ex., a MILE. Divide # of recorded steps from pedometer into 5,286 (feet)x 12 (inches)... and I think that should tell you how long your average step/stride is; enter THAT number."
3,Easy to lose,"I started using this pedometer 4 days ago and I am already extremely annoyed with it and ready to send it back.Good: The step-counting seems to be accurate enough, and though there is no protective cover the buttons resist accidental re-setting.Bad: My big complaint is the clip. This clip is so wimpy and weak the pedometer will not stay fastened to my clothing. I lose it 3 or 4 times a day while walking normally, even from one end of my house to the other. The last time it fell, it came apart in many pieces; the battery cover broke and the face plate will no longer snap correctly in place. I don't want to have to pay this much attention to my pedometer.I bought this to replace another, older pedometer from Sportline that I dearly love (with a very strong clip!). I wish I had not given it away, I'm going to buy a different brand and send this one back."
4,An Early Frost,"One of the first movies dealing with aids, if you haven't seen this drama it is well worth watching."
4,AMAZING TV MOVIE,"The first TV movie to deal with AIDS, this outstanding, thoughtful and undeniably powerful drama is about a young, successful gay lawyer who learns he is HIV-positive and decides to confront his family with both his sexuality and illness. Aidan Quinn gives a sensitive, commanding performance in the lead role and Gena Rowlands, Ben Gazzara and especially Sylvia Sydney offer strong support as, respectively, Quinn's mother, father and grandmother; and John Glover is remarkable as Victor, a dying AIDS patient. Get the tissues and get ready to cry! This movie is fantastic! I still can't believe it was made over 15 years ago. Just amazing!"
2,Limited Coverage,"This is a useful book if you are just getting started learning about mandarin squares. However, this slim volume does not go into any depth. The limited pictures of mandarin squares do not give any indication of how the designs changed over time. The time spent discussing embroidery techniques do not add much to the understanding of the things that were being embroidered. I found Ladder to the Clouds much more informative."
2,A very basic introduction...,"This book gives only a very basic introduction to Mandarin Squares. The number of photos is limited, and the book itself is very thin. For a much better book on the subject, check out Ladder to the Clouds by Beverly Jackson & David Hugus."
1,an offensive book,"I bought this book based on other customer reviews. I was sorely disappointed and very offended. The author presents a clearly homophobic bias, even implying that one becomes homosexual due to abuse. This is outdated, stereotypical, hateful information. It seems that if abuse caused homosexuality, there would be lots more homosexuals. I was hoping for healing and instead found a ""blame the victim"" mentality. The author clearly presents christianity as the only way through this issue. If that appeals to you great, if not, do not waste your time. This book should come with a warning label that clearly states its christian/religious message. If anything I have written disturbs you, don't buy this book-there are other very good books available on this topic."
4,A Door of Hope Recognizing and Resolving the Pains of your past,"Well written, great insight into incest. Well documented, great book for professional and for someone who has experienced incest as a child."
5,great price for a great book,I bought this when it first came out and lost it. I bought it again on Amazon for just a couple of dollars. It is worth the read and has helped me a lot. It is full of Scripture which has been an added bonus in helping deal with the past and present.
4,Hope is True,This is a good book. It shows very well that there can be hope in the toughest situations. And everyone can have their own Door of Hope. I recommend this book to readers who enjoy reading touching stories.
5,Best brand to use.,"I like to record my video games with this brand. Other brands, I like to record TV shows or movies.To record your video games, you need to have a tv that comes with the VCR."
4,A witty book,"Although I have not read this German translation, I can assure this is an excellent, witty and sutil work. Juan Emar's ""Un año"" is one of those shining and flawless minor works ever written in Chilean literature history (I may add Bombal's La Amortajada -The Shrouded Woman).Its style is impeccable and swift. Some stories are real masterpieces. It has nothing to do with Latinamerican magical realism commonplaces. A diaphanous work, as much as unknown in my very country. Is there an English translation of this book? Anyway, if you know Spanish, it's not tough readindg, except the Sea Waves tale."
5,Good book:informative and well-thought,"This book deals with ethical issues faced by regular, everyday people facing difficult situations. The Rabbi gives advice in a honest, yet sensitive manner. He advocates a respect for all people as we're all made in the image of God."
4,Beautiful South DVD a treat,"The Beautiful South DVD collection of music videos - Carry On Up The Charts showcases the band's great sense of humor and really adds to the viewer's enjoyment of their music. I was never a fan of the band in their heyday. I only learned about The Beautiful South years later after seeing their hilarious video for You Keep It All In on VH1Classic (back in the early 2000s when they actually played videos). Because of that one video, I have purchased this DVD, the identically titled Best Of CD, their debut CD, and all The Housemartins'(Paul Heaton's former band) CDs and DVD I could find. See, MTV and VH1 executives, if you play videos I will buy product. If all you show is reality programs I will ignore you. Amazon.com delivered it in about 5 days to Hawaii and it was in perfect condition."
5,The Perfect Sewing Gadget,"This is my 2nd stiletto, bought for my sister because I was afraid she was going to steal mine! The vendor shipped the product promptly, and I was happy to not have to drive all over town looking for one!"
3,Depressing,"I am one of the biggest fans of Redwall, having read each at the minimum of five times, and thought that this book was a bust. It was boring from the beginning little poem thing-a-bob, to the last sentence. I savoir each little diologue about even the most pointless things such as a baby talking or a mole speaking. Redwall was a great experience for me but this book was horrible. I wanted desperately to put it down but my loyalty to Redwall made me stay."
4,A good Redwall Book,"It has very good action scenes, and is a page thriller. Imagine Steven King, Tom Clancy, and a good action/fantasy writer with young kids to adults targeted in mind, you get Brian Jaques. The book had some storyline problems, as the other books have reveal different points of the series, but Dragonball/Z/GT has lots of plot errors and everybody loves it, why not this book. Not only is this book strong in every aspect, but gets the readers thinking. I never cry when I watch a sad movie, I laughed at Titanic and Ben Hur, feel little when I watch soap operas when nothing else is on, but these series almost made me cry as it deals with loss and death and herioc sacrifice, and makes you feel happy when they they have a festival or something. I recommend you this book because it's an exciting tale to all readers above 8."
2,Not exactly what i'd call legendary.,"And so to the weakest of the Redwall series to date.""The Legend of Luke"" is a book that suffers terribly from awful beggining and closing 'books' but(strangely) the outstanding middle 'book' is argurably the high point of the series.It is this that I award the two stars for, but Martin's quest is pretty much the same as the one as in ""Mossflower"",and is thus a yawn-inducing read.The book shows one thing,and that is that Bran Jaques should have dedicated a whole book to Luke the Warrior.Yet every book holds a major addition to the series,and this one clears up past mysteries,and introduces one of the best Redwall characters ever to appear,which is Ranguver Foeseeker."
4,Still going strong,"It's been three years since I read my first redwall book, salamandastron, and since then I havn't been able to get enough redwall. In the overall collection, this book stands up well against the others. It starts rather strong, with great action that kept me glued to the pages. The ending, though, left a bit to be desired. It just took too long to wrap up and I lost interest. However, if you're looking for a good yarn to curl up with on a lazy suday afternoon, this is definately a book to look at."
4,Crunched between two pillars,A Review by RichieThis book is basically a book inside of a book. So it is basically Martin and his friends go out to find out whatever happed to his father. Then they travel to the north shore while managing to kill lots of vermin and pick up more crew members. Then after eating and feasting at numerous places. They captured a bout and sailed to the north shore. At the north shore where martin once lived they found an old man called Verg. Who was Luke's best friend. Finally Verg took Martin and his friends to the Arf ship where they start reading the real story The Legend of Luke.I did not like that the book was unfulfilled. I did not understand why when martin was little he left the north shore before his dad came back. I also felt that the ending was too sudden. There where things still hanging in the air.I recommend that be for anyone reads this book they would have to read other Red Wall books like Moss Flower or Martin the Warrior.
5,The adventure continues,"This is one of the best books I have read of the whole series. It is set in the fast paced style of Martin the Warrior, and doesn't have puzzles. But that is easily compensated for by the loads of action that happen every other page! The plot is great and the adventures are awesome! Enjoy!"
4,Another pretty good Redwall novel,"If there is one thing I hate about the redwall books, it would be the descriptions of foods and all teh ""feasts."" It just loses it's taste(ha ha)after a while. Anyways, on to THIS book. It had two things I love about the Redwall books. 1.) It was about a time BEFORE many other novels written before it. 2.) It explored new lands! Islands, I should say. I love it when the books (and the maps. I love the maps) explore new places of the world Jacques has made. It was also a good plot but pretty much the same plot outline as all previous books. You know, first, they worry about an enemy. Second, they go exploring. Third, they fight the enemy and win. But there's always a different twist in that plot in each book. Anyways, if you like Redwall, then read this book. But I would suggest reading Martin The Warrior and Mossflower before reading this book. You'll understand it a little better."
2,Ho-hummm,"If you've read any of Jacques' books you already know this one.It reads as if he has been intimidated by adults/parents who do not think that children can handle the natural outcome of battle and think children should be protected at all costs.Here's the news folks, the fight of good against evil is not without cost. I'm with C.S.Lewis in saying don't take away the dragons, but show the knight that can slay them.This tale meanders, wanders, introduces pointless characters and events that have nothing to add to the progress of the tale.You want to read Jacques, go back and read his early work, then you'll have a much more satisfying tale."
2,"I wanted ""Legend Of Luke"", not ""Legend Of Martin Spending A Couple Hundred Pages Trying To Find The Legend Of Luke""","Ho-hum. When I first began reading this book, I kinda hoped it would be more of Luke than Martin. Maybe if they just had the Prolouge of Martin arriving, the next two Acts/Books of Luke, and maybe a short-ish third Act/Book of Martin's reaction/journey home. And too many characters accompany Martin on his way to the Arfship, I think. Maybe just him, Gonff, Furmo, and Trimp, nobody else. The focus should be on Luke. His name's in the title, his name should be there more."
5,THE BEST,"Here goes another masterpiece you especially don't wanna miss. The book is filled with all the action you need, humor from the price of mousethieves! And not to mention the incredible action-packed journey of Luke the warrior! CANNOT MISS THIS MASTERPIECE! MUST READ!"
5,Extremely Suspenseful!!!!!!!!,"This book receives a 10 out of 5! It is that good! The author, Brian Jacques shows a good example of how to show suspense in this book. When Martin sets out for his quest to find out if Luke is alive with his friends Trimp, Gonff(Very Funny), Dinny, and many other characters that accompany him, the author gives suspense by switching to the setting of Redwall whenever an exciting part comes up. The Redwall series is my favorite books and have also read and recommend:Mossflower,Redwall,Mattimeo,Pearls of Lutra,Outcast of Redwall,Triss,Mariel of Redwall,Martin the warrior, The Bell Maker,Salamandastron,The Legend of Luke(ofcourse.),Marlfox,Lord Brocktree,The Long Patrol,and Taggerung. I definately have been reading these for a long time and still am. I am also looking forward to the latest book in the series which is called Rackety-Tam. Anyway, back on subject all of the Redwall books is a good choice, but this one is definately one of my favorites!"
5,The best book yet!,"This is most definately the best Redwall book Brian Jacques has written yet! This is for all of us who were dissapointed that none of his books since Martin the Warriar and Mossflower were about Martin. This book has all of your favorite characters from Mossflower; Martin, Gnoff, Bella and more!Martin leaves Redwall with a small entourage; Gonff (of course), and a few other friends, to try to find what happened to his father, Luke. READ THIS BOOK!"
5,Why doesn't anyone like this????,"I don't know about anyone else, but I enjoyed this book. DO NOT read this until you've read Mossflower and Martin the Warrior. The book's about Martin wanting to find out more about his dad, Luke. Redwall fans will notice that one part in the second book is EXACTLY the same as part of Martin the Warrior. Oh, Martin seems to have forgotten Rose, Grumm, Pallum, Felldoh, and pretty much all his other old friends. This book is not for the faint of heart, because someone reeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaally important dies. And there's this cannibal otter who's insane and he's eating rats and stoats and ferrets and whatnot. It's good, though. 5 stars!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,"Buy it, enjoy it.","The Legend of Luke is a great book and you can finally find out what happened to Martans father Luke. The story is interesting and filled with excitement and adventure.A couple of close friends go with Martan to his childhood home where they hear the story of his father Luke from some of Luke's old friends. So in a way when you read this book you get two stories. One being the story of Luke and the other a story of Martans trek to and from his childhood home.Buy it, enjoy it."
1,It,did absolutely nothing. I couldn't tell i was taking it. There is a lot of English Ivy that grows where I live I was hoping this would help my sinuses. I usually have to blow with in an hour of coming inside morning or evening. would Not recommend. more reviews of everything @ b29349 on youtube. View NOW.
4,An excellent exploration of a forgotten art,"If you are fascinated by history or by scholarship throughout recorded time, you should enjoy this book. Francis Yates has created a detailed examination of memory techniques and their evolution over the course of generations. Beginning in ancient Greece and continuing through the Middle Ages, Yates shows how the art of remembering began as a sort of parlor trick and developed into an important skill in both religion and the occult. The influence from both individuals and cultures is described in a scholarly (yet not annoyingly so) way. While this book is not for everyone, its intended audience should be delighted.NOTE: This book is not a ""how-to"" manual for memory. It provides only a very general description of memory methods and is instead an exploration of the history of the art.An excellent companion piece to this book is _The Memory Palace of Matteo Ricci_. Both books were listed in the acknowledgements of Thomas Harris' _Hannibal_."
5,This book will change your life,"Quite simply one of the dozen or so most amazing books of history ever written. It will change your idea of history, art and even your own memory. It is a decisive work on the Renaissance and goes along way to explaining the development of perspective in painting and of the Elizabethan theater. But more than anything else this book reveals, as never before to this reader, the power and glory of the human imagination. It reawakens an ancient secret. Memory itself had been forgotten until Yates recalled it out of history's unconscious. This book is one for the ages."
3,Decent,"We have had the Wasp WPL 606 for about a year and we haven't had any mechanical problems with it. As noted by another, internal memory would be great, as would compatibility with non-Wasp barcode softwares. Even using Wasp Labeler 6.0, it takes a minute for the printer to begin printing. I give it 3 stars because it doesn't have any defects, just designing oversights."
2,Not as useful as I would have liked,"The book serves as a minor re-introduction to photography. I minored in photography in college, but have let the hobby slip since losing my equipment many years ago. I got a digital camera some years ago, and was frustrated by the lack of control over the image. I finally moved back into SLRs by purchasing a D60 (which I love.)This book was a brief re-introduction to basic settings, but shows no real comparative results between the various settings, as a previous reviewer had already mentioned. There is SOME usefull information in this book, but none of it unique to this particular camera. General information about aperture and speed control can be gotten from better general books. Don't bother buying this one."

5,Make a plan and follow it through,"This book is for women who work for themselves as well as those who work for somebody else. It can help you if you're still in school and just starting out or about to retire and want to know how to maximize that nest egg. It's practical and down-to-earth and you can use the information immediately, without having to figure it out. Marilyn gives it to you straight in plain English."
1,Is this total price a misprint?,"""Sold as 5 UNITS at $5.17 per unit. (1 unit = Pk/20.)"" is what the body says for this ad. This equals $25.85 according to my calculator. However this ad is charging $79.99 (plus $8.49 for s&h). Let the buyer beware."
1,Poor Qualty of Welding Cart,Could not place two bottles of gas onto cart as the rails where welded out of position.Bad center of balance.
3,good enough,"Bought this welding cart because it was cheap. Drill some holes in the storage basket, and it becomes sort of ok. Mine came with a flat tire that won't take air. don't expect much and you will be fairly happy."
3,It's too much not like a diaper bag.,"Please be advised that BabyAge has a NO RETURNS policy on diaper bags for hygiene reasons.I returned the bag to the manufacturer for 50% of its retail price, so I don't have long-term information about the bag. However, since there was no previous review, I figured a little information is better than no information.I am looking for a diaper bag that doesn't look like a diaper bag, so to speak, but this bag takes it a little too far. It basically isn't a diaper bag at all. It has the fabrice texture and look of a Kate Spade non-diaper handbag on the outside but none of the padding of a Kate Spade diaper bag on either the outside or the inside. So if you're going for Kate-Spade-like, this is not the bag for which you're looking.It does have a changing pad and bottle cozy thing, but the rest of it looks like an uncomfortable, uptight laptop bag. I wouldn't do it."
4,Puppetoon Review,George Pal's Puppetoons are great. I remember watching them 45 years ago whilst growing up. I was hopeing for a few more toons with The Screw Ball Army in them but one is better than none. Well worth the little money I paid.
3,"Description misleading, not 1"" x 1"" x 1""","I was expecting 1"" gum balls as stated in the detailed description. They are actually the smaller gum balls, about 750 in the container. The gum itself is good though (4-5 stars)."
3,over priced,Way over priced -this should be between no more that $15.00. I didn't have time to run out and buy some. This price is highway robbery.
1,"WAY OVERPRICED, same thing for $6 at wal-mart","I ordered this not realizing that wal-mart has the exact same thing (different brand) at wal-mart for $6. Seriously. Same size container, same size gumballs in their grocery candy section. I was really hoping when this arrived that there would be ""something"" special about it, ie, bigger than I realized with more volume or larger size gumballs. Nope. Exact same thing as the $6 gumball container at wal-mart. What a waste of money. Shame on me for not checking wal-mart FIRST."
5,These Witches Are Hilarious!,"When I saw this video, I don't remember how old I was. I do remember my mom got it on VHS at Kmart around Halloween, and I loved watching this movie over and over until Halloween passed. I never saw it again until last Halloween. the original tape we purchased got lost, and I couldn't remember the title of the movie. After several google searches, I got the title of the movie, and I ordered the DVD right here on Amazon, just intime for Halloween. I love this movie, and I'm sure your kids will too if they haven't seen it yet. It's only about half an hour in length, but it's funny!"
1,Horrible,"All this did was teach my 5 year old to say ""stupid"" and start howling.....Did not like this purchase, not even for 2 bucks. Wish there had been a preview....."
2,Dont like,I bought this for my classroom and it was a little to much for them. They didn't really like it.
3,average,I thought this would be cute for my 4 year old boys. It really didn't hold their attention at all. I was looking for something with a Halloween theme that was'nt scary. Really wasn't worth the money.
1,"NOT for the whole family, under 5 only, just not funny","I bought this based on the other reviews that said it was fun for the whole family--it wasn't fun for anyone. Even my 3 year old was bored. I can't believe I paid $10 for something so cheaply made. It was very short and it reminded me of Flintstones-type animation. The gags were just stupid; one of the witches said they should go to a hotel and order ""broom service."" Geez. It's just not worth the money; we won't be watching this again and now I just feel like I wasted $10."
4,Grandaughter Loves It,"I got this for my granddaughter, and she loves watching it. If you look at it through the eyes of an adult, I don't get it, but she seems to love it, so that is good enough for me."
2,TOO SHORT!,Overall a cute story but it was very short and definitely not worth the money. Skip this one for Spookely the Pumpkin. It states that the movie is 30 mins but it was more like 20mins plus the very long credits.
1,It was painful...,"I purchased this after reading the other reviews...wow that was a mistake. The DVD is poor quality. It is short,thankfully, because if I had to hear the witch scream/cackle one more time I think my brain might have exploded. We watch other programs over and over, but I could only stand to sit through this one once. My daughter was not interested in it at all. It is definitely going into the goodwill box at first opportunity for someone else to enjoy/hate."
1,zzzzzzzz,"I read this book when I was 11. I was bored to tears and insulted at the simplicity of the plot. Maybe an immature tween, or someone much younger, would appreciate this book more, but if you are not buying this book for someone who fits that description, beware."
5,in one word brilliant,"the soundtrack for the film reach the rock has an excellent blend of mood, feeling, and mystery. i think that john mcentire did an amazing job on the whole project. i especially like the tenth song on the cd entitled the kiss. the song by dianogah entitled dreams of being king, has the must beautiful guitar parts. the polvo track, reverse migraine, with the piano, the rich and soothing piano. this release excites me about the future of music. YOU MUST BUY THIS CD"
5,Brilliant and Unique,"I absolutely love this album. I bought this album when it first came out because the record store I went to were out of the particular Tortoise record I was looking for. This album encapsulates a particular time in McEntire's work, filling the gap between Millions Now Living/ TNT/ Sea and Cake's the Fawn. This really is some of McEntire's best work, and I am still in awe of this album to this date. It also fits nicely with the Hefty Records catalogue making me wonder how much input John Hughes III had in it ( I mean that in a positive light). This album is an absolute must for anyone who is a fan of ANY of McEntire's work. Can't praise this one enough..."
2,Yawn.,"I expected more from this CD. This is mostly instrumental mood music, just fine for a movie soundtrack, but pretty boring on its own. Tortoise's ""Millions Now Living..."" CD covers the same musical territory and is a real mind-blower. Buy that instead."
3,Opera review,"The performers are excellent, the music wonderful, but the recording seems to lack ""fire"" or real passion. I was a bit disappointed. I love Renee Fleming, and she is her usual excellent form here, but somehow it just didn't jell for me."
5,Still Have An Old VCR That Works?,If you have an old VCR that still works and you enjoy taping your TV shows you now know how hard it is to find tapes. This will more than likely become even harder. We located these on Amazon. They are a great buy and are becoming very difficult to find. These Maxwell takes are of very good quality and the prices if fantastic.
5,Good Bargain...,"Currently I'm moving some family memories from older VHS tapes to DVD-Ram and ripping them to a digital format on my PC. Since these are important memories, I want to have as many backups as possible so rerecording them back onto 'fresh' VHS tapes is something important to me. Comparing these tapes to local price, the price here on Amazon is very competitive. After recording older footage onto these VHS tapes, I'm quite satisfied with the quality of these tapes on the SP record setting. Not much has changed in the VHS tape since it has become such a dinosaur, but it's great to be able to get this product when you need it, for a reasonable price."
4,Good value,"I still use videotapes for easy, uncomplicated recording of things I don't plan on keeping indefinitely. I've used two tapes from the pack I bought and they are just fine. No problems so far. Am rating 4 rather than 5 only because I haven't been using them long, and I haven't done much re-recording, which is something else I do. I may buy more before it becomes impossible to buy them!"
1,Really bad tapes!,"The tapes wouldn't record, but it is not worth the effort to return. Purchased some from local Radio Shack and they worked fine!"
1,Blurry at all resolutions,"A couple years ago, our IT department replaced all our perfectly good 17"" monitors with Planar PV174 flat panels. Big mistake. They are blurry at all resolutions, making them very unpleasant to use all day. At the alleged native resolution of 1280x1024, they are painfully hard to read. I have to keep mine at 800x600 to keep my eyes from bugging out. I've found several reviews raving about how crisp and clear they are, and I can only wonder what those people were really looking at, because it couldn't have been one of these. These displays are so bad, I felt an obligation to seek out this product here and write this warning."
