5,Best Work This Year,"Buy this album if you like:(1) Great lyrics.(2) Outstanding guitar work.(3) Diversity in an album.(4) A soothing vocalist.(5) Songs of truth.and on and on I could go.This album exceeded my expectations (which were high after years of hearing these songs acoustically in concert).""Falling"" is a modern-day Tom Petty song.""Courage"" just makes you feel good.""Released"" is so soothing.Don't be surprised to hear many of these songs in movies and on tv soon. So go get the album...now!"
5,A clean story,"I like the Penny Nichols series not only because it's clean, but it's easy to set down & pick up later right where you kleft off & you still remember the plot. It's not exciting, but it's interesting. There's not much more to say about this but I had to add 20 more words to leave this review."
5,Thoroughly enjoyable mystery and heroine/sleuth!,"I just downloaded this book last night and already I'm finished with it. I can't say enough good things about it. It astounds me that only 4 Penny Nichols books were ever published. Penny is a charmer. She is so great, feisty and plucky. I like her a lot more than Nancy Drew because unlike Nancy Drew, she does have some faults. Plus the mystery was engaging and fast-moving. I am off to download the second book in the series. I will cry bitter tears when I have read them all. There should have been tons more!"
5,A detailed check list and resource guide for relocation!,"I was feeling a liitle nervous about trying to remember all the important things about moving to HI. This book provided me with a check list and ALL of the information I could have needed, AND MORE. It provides you with helpful hints, phone #'s of important resources and Joyce has even E-Mailed me personally with helpful hints and has offered to assist me in making the transition smooth!! I recomend it to anyone planning to move or even vacation in Hawaii!"
1,horrible review,"This book is horrible. After having moved from the mainland to Hawaii and living there for 22 years, I find this book appalling. I do however, congratulate this woman for getting someone to publish this garbage and actually make money from it."
2,Beware of the expiration date,"Unlike instore shopping, you will not be able to see the expiration date of the products you buy online.I bought 2 in May 2005 and the Visines I received both have expiration date of June 2005 - a full 30 days to use the two 1oz bottles! I tried to return them, but was told that I needed to pay for the return shipping cost. Just something to keep in mind.---"
4,Overall a good product.,The Sony SB-V40S does exactly what it is supposed to do. Overall build quality is good and I do not see any degradation of signal input into my TV. The switches work well and are easy to use. I would give it 5 stars if it was $10 cheaper.
4,Does what it is supposed to,This is a good product but I cannot go all the way and say that it is great because I am not an audio/video nerd. I don't have a high quality digital TV to compare signal transfer with and without the selector. I have three DVD players and a MiniDV recorder connected to the selector. From what I can tell everything works just like it is supposed to. I don't have any noticable loss of either video or audit signal. I have used the selector for 6 months and I am happy with the convinience it gives me when I switch from one DVD player to another. The selector is a passive device and is not plugged into an electrical outlet. Neither does it have its own remote control (which I think is excessive anyway). It just does what it is supposed to do and does it well.
2,No Tab,"Not sure what book was reviewed by others, but mine did not include guitar tablature.I was looking forward to learning to play some of my favorite songs. I'm sending it back."
4,Very Useful,"This is a very handy book that has even more games than the first book. I like the way the book is organized, so you can easily find a game to match the needed training activity."
5,Inspired by miracles,"This is a wonderful, thoughtful and inspiring book. It is also very practical wisdom. The author is both generous and kind. This is a book of solid spiritual therapy. It is a shame it is out of print. It would make an excellent Kindle book."
5,now what do I do?,"(Updated Review)In these ecomomic times (2010)here is a concise book that gets to the point-and is full of useful information- a handbook for everyone, not just women, to use in the process of figuring out what you want and need at a certian time of your life. As a business and personal coach, I have used the book for myself and now have made it a ""Must Read"" for my clients. I would recommend this book to coaches and counselors as well as those who choose to ""do it themselves"". The information contained in this book facilitates and clarifies the self-empowerment process. Better still, it allows the possibility for real results."
5,Do this first...,"If you or a woman you know needs to understand how to move forward through the dynamics of change and career, Now What Do I Do is the right place to start.I recommend Chapter 10, devoted to working for yourself and starting your own business, to my interior redesign students. Good business basics and ideas, worthy of frequent review."
4,"Useful for guys, too","I bought this book to give to my sister, but I read it before I gave it to her (being careful not to crack the binding). While the book is geared to women (e.g. tackling re-entering the workplace), I found this a valuable read for men like myself.I have read a number of books of this variety from people like Barbara Winter and Barbara Sher, but ""Now What Do I Do?"" asked some of the soul-searching questions in a way that helped me come up with thoughts and ideas I didn't imagine before. I found this extremely valuable.For me, the book didn't offer enough in terms of ""what"" to do (that's why I gave it 4/5 stars). But then again, I didn't actually do the exercises. Overall, this is a very useful resource for anyone looking for a more impactful move that just finding a job."
5,Practical and inspiring,"I've read a lot of career change advice over the years, and found this one of the best. Dr. Cannon's book is short and to the point, but also addresses the fundamental questions that lead to satisfying career choices. The exercises are interesting (I usually skip the exercises, but these were worth the effort.) And the focus on mid-life changes is very helpful. I am happy with the career change I've now made (from consulting into non-profit management), but I will be buying more copies of this book as gifts for friends in the midst of mid-life career decisions."
3,"Nice size, sturdy . . . and with Triclosan","Once received, I noticed that the label says ""With Microban."" From the Rubbermaid website, accessed today: ""Triclosan is used in a few Rubbermaid products in non-food contact applications such as Microban sinkware and select coolers because it provides antimicrobial & odor resistance that consumers desire. These Microban antimicrobial technologies are EPA approved and built-in to the product during manufacturing to become part of the product. We are aware that the FDA is engaged in an ongoing scientific and regulatory review of the safety of triclosan in FDA-regulated products and we are closely following developments in this area.""Triclosan in my dish pans? For what? I'm sending them back."
4,"Good item, but mistakes in description","This is a good dishpan. I am giving four stars because there are mistakes in description of this item size. It is stated in Product Dimensions - 12.8 x 14.6 x 15.6 inches, in Product Description - 15.6 quart capacity. 15.8'' x 12.4'' x 6.6''.Size of an item on manufacture label is 15.23 x 12.46 x 7.8 inches.When I was ordering, I looked on product dimension size and was expecting a deeper basin."
5,Deep & Sturdy,Our trusty deep dishpan of 15+ years finally died last week. I tried to replace it but the only ones I found in stores were shallow and flimsy (which makes a difference when you go to dump out a bucket full of dirty dishwater). I ordered the closest dishpan I could find online (this 15.6 qt Rubbermaid). It was delivered today and low and behold it is the same exact model I purchased over 15 years ago. I was actually psyched to get it - which you don't usually expect over something as mundane as a dishpan.
5,"Not big enough, but it seems to be nice","Well, I need a stuff to organize all my pot, kitchen knives, dishes, chopsticks.....I want to find a dishpan to put all these stuff into it, it seems that this product has a neither too expensive nor too cheap price, so I chose it.Not to much psurprice, clean, steady. But it's not big enough, you can put it into a sink, but I can't lay my pots down in this dishpan.You can view the picture I have uploaded"
5,Great Dishpan,"Sturdy, durable, easy to use. Perfect for pedicures which is why I bought it. The depth is nice for that purpose."
4,Excellant DIshpan,"This dish pan met all of my requirements, from being durably made to the correct size and height.The only thing that I desired was a tan color."
4,works fine,The phone works as expected and is not bothered by my microwave (a problem with my previous phone)
3,Bit Above Average,I have loved by panasonic phones equipped with talking called ID but Panasonic no longer makes this phone. The TG6012 is fine. It works.But it's not fun like the other one.
5,Panasonic Cordless Phone,One of the best Cordless Phones that we have ever had. So good that I went ahead and ordered one for myself. I read all the reviews before buying this item and was very suprised at the quality and clariety of the phone.
4,Panasonic Cordless Phone,"So far there haven't been any problems with this new phone. It is so much more clear in reception. Our old phone had static and this one has none at all. My mother insisted we get a new phone so, due to past experiences with Panasonic products, I tried this one and as usual, not dissappointed. Several ringtones to choose from, caller ID is great. Just a all around good phone!"
3,Nice Phone,"Bought this one because I wanted to use my old answerig machine. Phone works well but the ""SPEAKER FEATURE"" leaves much to be desired."
2,Defective and does not work properly. Over used previously.,This item dropped volume and is erractic. Work intermittently and poorly then. I am very disappointed with this unit. It is not worth the postage to return. I found a less expensive unit on Ebay.
5,awesome range..!!,"i live on a second floor of a building, i was using it, and had to go to the parking lot to look for something at the car.... i used the elevator, the signal remained intact, i reached the lobby... still good...went in and out of my car... and i was still talking with no interference or lack of signal... i dont know if it was because there was an opened window between my apartment and the lot.. but it was working..well.. in my situation.. i guess the experience could be different in other situations.... anyway.. excellent range, and quality...!! extremely recommended....A++..!!"
3,Very nice - for awhile,"I had a previous Panasonic cordless phone which only lasted about 9 months and really didn't work that well. I bought a cordless Uniden after that and it has been great for 5 years. I needed another cordless phone for my office, and based on the favorable reviews of this Panasonic phone (New Uniden phones look cheap now), I purchased it about 2 months ago. The sound is quite good, the range is very good, and the speaker phone feature is excellent. People can't even tell when I switch it to speaker mode. However, now when the battery indicator shows full charge, the phone may only work for about 2 minutes and then starts beeping and the indicator says that it needs charged again - back in the cradle for another several hours. I ordered a new battery hoping that is the source of the problem. If that doesn't fix it, this will be one expensive piece of junk. I'll post a follow-up comment stating the results."
1,Very dissatisfied,"After reading the many positive reviews about this 'phone, I bought one. But...it's terrible. From the start, it constantly cuts out while in use, even though the base is less than 4 feet away."
4,Nice Phone,"This is a nice no frills phone. My last one, after 7 years still works fine and battery still holds a good charge. I could'nt find a new phone that works as good as this one."
5,"wonderful cordless, many nice features","EXTREMELY easy to set up and easy to use. You can program it to have different ringtones for family and friends so you know who's calling before you look at the caller ID. Nice compact base. Overall, one of the best cordless phones I have ever owned."
3,The usual faults,"The phone works - no problem there. But...The wall-mount option is a kludge. Instead of fitting flat against the wall, the phone sticks out (in exactly the same orientation as pictured). Not especially great for the under-cabinet location in the kitchen.The numbers in the display are too small. You want to be able to read the number of an incoming call at a glance, and this display is too small."
4,Still my favorite cordless,"I bought this phone to replace my older model panasonic 2.4GHz cordless. I loved my old one and this one is a nice progression for the phone. It sounds great, easy to use, rubber keys for easy dial grip, no external antenna, great white display, the list goes on. Only negative I think is the all plastic body which (slippery) needs some rubber side pads to grip and make the handset easier to hold. Hope that will be coming on the next model. Rubber keys are a start. Otherwise, the menu is easy and no overly complicated features. Everything I need in a phone."
3,"Good phone, no belt-clip","The phone works great, and looks cool. The only problem is that it doesn't have a belt clip that you can put on the phone to make it easier to use with a headset. Pretty big issue for use in my home, but I can see why they didn't do it; the phone sits on the cradle face up and the belt clip would probably keep it from recharging.But maybe if they could have designed the cradle a bit differently, it might have all worked.If you don't care about a belt clip option and don't want an answering machine, this is a good solid cordless phone with great range."
4,so far so good,"We needed a new phone to replace a very old portable and we chose this model based upon reviews, features and price. I've had it about a month and so far am very happy with the phone. It's easy to use, and has great reception. The big test will be how it holds up, and whether it keeps a charge after a year or so. I have Vtech phones that are no more than 2 years old and don't hold a charge at all. I am definitely considering replacing those with additional ones like this."
1,There are better books. Avoid this one.,The book does not really go into any investment process and is confusing. I prefer Value Investing Today or Ben Graham's books. Avoid this one.
5,Simply Awesome!,"This is a compilation of the Church's first ten years, and it is a must for both fans and newcomers alike. It has many of their best songs, although there are many more great tunes not on this disc that weren't released as singles. This disc also has the Church's only known cover tune, 'I am a rock', which, up to now, has never been on CD. And what a splendid rendition it is!"
4,Beware: A Policy Paper - Not a Parenting Manual,"I read this book expecting to obtain help and information on disciplining and understanding my 2 year old. Instead, the book outlined cleary and forcefully policy points for addressing the various problems facing todays world youth.While this book (i) makes for interesting ""cocktail party"" conversation for the casual observer and (ii) provides valid and interesting action plans for those in the legislative, judicial or social work arenas addressing various problems facing children(e.g., custody dispute resolution norms), this book is not a how-to book for parents (like some of Brazelton's other books).This book should not be bought by those seeking a how-to parenting book. Other more informative books on this subject should be consulted instead. On the other hand, this book should be bought by those engaged in any aspect of work with children."
5,speaking up for children,"Gail Hudson's review above words things a little oddly. True, you could argue that this book says children ideally should be in day care less than 30 hours a week, but what it actually says it that ideally, an infant should be at home with a full=time parent! Less than ideal is excellent day care, and it should not happen more than 30 hours a week.These and other specifics are in this book - how many floor sessions to have with a toddler, how much holding time an infant needs, how many hours of one on one an elementary schooler needs.This book is marvelous. All parents will find they've fallen short of the ideal, but here's some directions to follow in geting back on track."
3,Good read for educators.,I was a little disappointed in this book. I am an educator but was reading from the perspective of a first time parent. It would be helpful for any teacher interested in teaching to individual differences. I wouldn't recommend this to parents unless they happen to be teachers as well.
2,Extremely wordy,"This book is an extremely wordy book and I did not get a clear direction for a practical training program, unlike Heart Monitor Training for the Compleat Idiot, which I would highly recommend."
1,Fluf and self-promotion,"How much self-promotion can one author write in a book? Apparently, this author knows how much! Like other books by this author, this book is very simply written and presents some important information in a simple and straight-forward manner.On the other hand, the book states some things as truisms that are not necessarily scientific facts.But, the part of the book I found most annoying is the author's propensity to promote herself shamelessly.I can live without it, there are better books on the market."
5,Good Folk Music,"I heard this group live and the first song they did was Dulaman.This was the most intense song I ever heard sung! If you are new to Chanticleer this is where to start. All of their songs were thuroughly researched, and somtimes taken from locals from tours to those countries. Buy it and experience their wonder."
4,Great folksy album,"This album has some great tunes from all over the world, focusing on the USA. It has a nice mix of slow and pensive, and fast and joyous. As always with Chanticleer, it is nothing but pristine harmonies and spot-on pitches. Great listening material, for both background music and more attentive entertainment!"
4,Gift for son,Bought this for my son for Christmas. Everything was in its place and great case with it too. He uses it for his job all the time
4,La Belle France: A Short History,"I bought this book thinking it would be a humorous, fast read.It isn't; it is a serious piece of work. After an initial surprise, I began to really enjoy it and found it to be very informative and interesting. The author knows his subject cold.He writes beautifully. This book is worth the effort."
4,French history without the sauce,"Everybody knows something about French history, but much fewer can place individual events like the French Revolution, Napoleon's rise and fall, and the Paris Commune into context. Alistair Horne takes on that task and does a pretty good job of it. Horne's pleasant writing style borders on the chatty but it's a chattiness that is informed by a deep understanding of French history and, particularly, the central role that Paris has played in it, a fact that is true down to the present day. While Horne exhibits a deep affection for France, he doesn't allow that to deter him from dispassionately and clearly discussing the glorious and horrendous periods in French history. If you ever wanted to know how all those places and events described in the Michelin Green Guides are tied together, this is the book for you."
4,Only a decent history,"If you want a readable and simple history of France this is a good book, but it is not a great book and there are entire pieces of it that could have been left out. The first problem is that most of the book up untill the 16th century, or up until Louis XIV, is basically weak, it is weak on writing and comprehension and story-telling. It is just not very interesting and cobbled together, collected facts. There is absolutely no sense of pre 800 A.D France. The period after Louis XIV however is well written with a full understanding of the currents in French politics, culture and military affairs.Therefore this is a good read, a very general history and one that someone should buy who knows very little of French history. If you are remotely familiar with the outlines of French history you may be disappointed.Seth J. Frantzman"
2,A collection of anecdotes,"This is not the place to go to in order to find out much about France or its history. Sketchy, repetitious, a mishmash of anecdotes. If you're looking for amusing tidbits, there's a plethora of them here, but they're presented in a confusing, non-chronological order."
3,The Good France,"A book that gains strength when the author relates the history of 20th century France, an era with which he is very familiar and comfortable. The first part of the book focuses on the long line of kings of France and their misadventures. Little is learned of the average citizen or about any city other than Paris.This book should not be bought for a strictly accurate and complete history of France, but for the observations of an old and informed English friend of the country across the channel.One quarrel with editors: Every book in English on France shouldhave all French phrases--except for the most obvious (such as this book's title)--translated into English in a footnote or in the text."
1,?,"This book must be by an anglophile with a distaste for the French, although he's made a career of writing French history books. He gives one short paragraph to France's oldest hero, Charlemagne. As time goes on myth and fact become lost. However, Horne dismisses Charlmagne as an eccentric unimportant absentee ruler who makes no impact on the history of France! An amazing assumption. This should be an historical novel. Horne also has another strange footnote on the same page from Huxley, where he agrees that the French are Germans gone Latin. You can accept this on a superficial level, but to summerize an entire culture with such small mindedness... when you title your book La Belle France.......you will get more valid information from encyclopedias."
3,"Missing CD, but functional","The transaction was smooth. However, the book was advertised as having the CD, but did not. I informed the company, but they have not responded to date."
4,Great Service!,"The condition of the book was great(like new). Seemed like I turned around after ordering and the book arrived it was so quick. My only issue was that it was the wrong edition and that might have been me not paying attention to the sellers description. So make sure you do that. Otherwise, great service!"
4,Entertaining.,I am a big fan of Patricia Arquette! I saw the movie Stigmata many many years ago in the theatre and was entranced by it. I did not realize that it was Patricia Arquette. When it came up for a dvd purchase I had to have it. She is such a great actress. She has such a range of talent that I have not seen in a long time. She can just be someone else and then quickly turn into another character and the change is spectacular to watch.
3,two dvds on case...,"first ill say stigmata was the main reason i bought this, Stigmata was in perfect condition. but i cannot say the same for wicker park. Wicker park was on the flap, & of course Wicker park was knocked loose off that flap... Nothing a quick trip to hastings cant fix :)"
4,Our evolutionary roots control the way we learn.,"Meaty and intellectual exploration of the evolutionary basis of knowledge and learning, a subject known as evolutionary epistemology. We have built-in filters and mechanisms that control our learning, resulting in quirky but predictable oddities in our perceptions and abilities.--Richard Brodie, author, Virus of the Mind: The New Science of the Mem"
4,a cute little book,"Cindy Corey's _Exploring the Lighthouses of North Carolina_ is a cute little book. It could serve as a guide for a tourist or family of tourists exploring the coast. In fact, it's almost a pamphlet-sized book, so you can throw it in your glove compartment and bring it along for the ride.Each of the North Carolina lighthouses gets about a one- or two-page treatment. The information is general, and the writing is clear. It's easy to understand. I think a 10 or 12 year old child could surely absorb the information in the book.However, there are no photos in the book. The maps appear to be hand-drawn; the pictures of the lighthouses are illustrations also. This gives the book a homey, old-fashioned feel.If you have a relative or friend who is planning a trip to the coast, or someone who has an interest in the N.C. lighthouses, this would make an appropriate and inexpensive little present. It's an affordable alternative to more expensive coffee table books on the subject.ken32"
4,"Good for the money, bad for the pro!!","We have purchased five (5) Robo Lasers, and just because we have made that many purchases of it should let you know that there is something we like about it. It works well and the fact that it is self leveling and remote control, makes a one man project out of most line setting. The ""bad for the pro"" as formentioned comes from the experience that we have had with it. It is kind of like a hologen light..... it is great to have when you need it, but knock it over just once and you just as well throw it in the roll-off dumpster. My crew find themselves working outside in the breeze and sometimes wind quite frequently.... the laser on the tripod and a brisk breese = no more laser level... be prepaired to treat this one with kid gloves."
1,A displeased Robolaser Owner,"I purchased both the Robolaser and Robolevel. After trying to used the 'laser', I found it was not calibrated from the factory and would not calibrate...it is a toy!... Spend a little extra and purchase a better laser!!!"
3,Entertaining Music Video,"This video offers a great combination of rare space footage and the ultra modernistic rock of Jan Hammer. It is not necessarily a documentary as there is no written or spoken word. It is purely video of various launches and landings set to music. It is truly an entertainment piece.For those who have an interest in space, the footage sequences are spectacular. Many of the songs by Jan Hammer are also exclusive to this video."
1,Bitter!,"I ordered these supposedly sweet peas from this seller and couldn't wait to try them. They sprouted well, but were bitter. I originally thought I had done something wrong in the sprouting process, but I decided to try an unsprouted dry seed. I rinsed it and it was bitter before I even started the sprouting process. I contacted the seller directly to let them know they may have a bad batch. The seller told me that some people rave about the sweetness of her peas and some say they are bitter. I've gardened for years and the only time peas are bitter are when they are overripe. The seller should be tasting and testing the batch before buying it. She did not apologize at all. The garbanzo bean sprouts I bought tasted fine so I think it's this batch of peas. I wanted to get a replacement, but was afraid it would be bitter as well. The seller was nice enough to check the lot number for me and it was the same so I decided to go for a refund instead which I needed to do through Amazon."
1,Bitter...don't buy.,Bitter tasting peas.Mine came with the hemp bag as a sample and I'm definately not buying these.The company should stop sending these as a sample.
5,Scienide!,I'd buy this only for Scienide! I think that song is better than some on the Jilted Generation album!
5,"I got the Poison, I got the Remedy...","Bangin' dance/rock/Hip-Hop, genius tune! It feels more like a Hip-Hop tune than anything but damn, it rocks hard too!!"
4,Not really Fantasy but a nice Who-dun-it.,"If you read this expecting your typical Fantasy title, you will be a bit disappointed The two demons that only briefly appear are only plot elements and strictly Church issue. This book is much more like The Name of The Rose. a nice detective tale in an historical setting. (Here Venice) It is a good read and I enjoyed it but I think it was only labeled Fantasy to keep it in line with the author's other work."
4,Good start for a good series.,"The other reviewers captured the book well; no point in repeating their observations. However, having just finished the third in the series, I can confidently recommend all three; there need be no hesitation in starting the trilogy. The latter two are just as solidly crafted, with the same Venetian flourishes and furbelows, with no letdown from the first."
4,Duncan Does it Again,"Yes he does. Dave Duncan is one author who never fails me. An excellent story with completely believable characters this is a murder mystery set in Italy in the time of Nostrodomus. One of his clients has died and the old master is blamed. Now, it's up to his apprentice to prove who done it.Duncan keeps the plot moving and keeps you guessing right up to the end with a few neat twists thrown in for good measure."
5,StrongArm Toyota Avalon Hood Lift (Right Side),The StrongArm 4549R for 1995 Toyota Avalon was easy to install and worked perfectly. The hood no longer comes smashing down due to a strong wind. And the best thing is that it costs about 50-75% of the hood lifts sold at my local Auto Parts stores.
2,Old Ink for sale.,"I purchased 2 HP cartridges. This company removed the ""use until"" dates, on both cartridges. I won't buy from them again. These cartridges are probably useless to me now."
4,Comprehensive,"The book's material is useful for the beginning and intermediate volleyball coach. I have been feeling my way in coaching my team in small tournaments for some years now, but reading this book makes me feel like I've gone to a volleyball coaching clinic.I especially like the way the book emphasizes the development of each of the skills and positions in a team. Also, therapy of the common injuries included at the end are a great plus.On the whole it has a very well-rounded treatment of coaching, including not only the physical, but also psychological, medical and nutritional elements that have to be considered by a good volleyball coach. The book is overflowing with actual coaching experience of a number of people. I learned a lot from it."
5,Detailed instruction,Asher's approach of employing experts in each chapter to discuss their respective forte yields a thorough and insightful text. I have upwards of 12 coaching books and this one I think to be the most valuable.
3,For the hip hop music fan with a chip on the shoulder,"Just Ice is still mean and vicious just like he should be. If you're pissed off listen to this, you'll be able to relate to the message and it will help you calm down. hell if you're angry at the world listen to anything by the man just ice. i know i did. a great album!"
2,"Somewhat outdated, not particularly robust","This book covers many of the same ideas that Richard Montauk's book does: how to position yourself to business schools, the importance of knowing the school, etc. However, the advice is outdated with much of the advice written in reference to the early 1990s when the authors attended HBS. Further, most of the advice is given in the form of critiquing the essays of others, which is a somewhat tedious way to get the message.I think that the Montauk book does a better job of addressing the positioning/marketing issues, and Montauk has is a more robust treatment of the rest of the application process. Save your money and skip this book."
3,Good but outdated,THis book is useful but it is somehow outdated. I wish that the authors would write a new version that would be more up-to-date. I have the impression that the rules of the game have a bit changed.
3,Adequate to get you started...,"The book written by two Harvard BS graduates, it is full of examples like ""one of our friends who attended Princeton before applying did this,"" or ""our Stanford fellow tried that..."" Although it does contain the basic information about positioning oneself while applying to a business school, it seems to consentrate on the means of distinguishing one from a pool of the perfect applicatnts with 750 GMAT score, perfect ivy league undergrad records, and impeccable work experience... If you are not one of those, better search for other source of info. International students - you will hardly find any applicable advice in this book other than ""try to emphasize your ethnic origins."""
2,adequate book,This is an adequate book on the business school process. An insider's perspective is described by two Stanford undegrads on the profile of people accepted by top business schools.
3,Good as a starter kit,"There are two parts to the product: one booklet that provides a very general outline of ayurveda and provides a simple grid of determining your body type: spring, summer or winter. Depending on your body type, the booklet identifieds the symptoms that you may experience and a general cure. The DVD is split into the following parts: explanation of ayurveda, the foods that are associated with your body time and they use a patient-doctor to explain the process; the final part is related to to tools to use and is further broken down to 12 minutues meditation, 15 minutes of yoga, massage => great if you can dedicate a good hour before you go to work. in my real life, I can only use bits of it during the work week.I like the message that avurveda is to prevent stress rather than a lot of products out there that try to cure the symptoms. Good enough for me to be encouraged to look into more of avurveda"
2,Eat nuts because Squirrels do,"I like that he offers a different concept in that he relates us to Winter, Spring & Summer and then recommends food & exercise based on that. For example, I'm Winter because I'm tired, cold & dry.However, he says things like we should eat nuts because Squirrels eat nuts. Now, I love Squirrels, but I don't think we're anything like Squirrels.He wants us to follow a morning routine that would probably take 3 hrs. Now, if you don't have a job or sch, I would recommend it. However, it just doesn't seem very practical unless you can afford to get up 3 hrs earlier than you need to.The video includes yoga."
2,A huge disappointment,This book has some interesting details and tidbits for the Titanic enthusiast but otherwise is a huge disappointment. The text is dull and the photo reproductions are simply appalling.
1,Beware: one of the worst set of computer games ever,"The description of the game is great, it makes you want to buy it. Do not let the advertising trick you. The games are very poorly designed, bad graphics. Most games are from the early 90's. I contacted the manufacurer after I installed the games and requested an explanation on why they sell old games as brand new, never got an answer. A waste of money!"
4,"Works well, but...","water vapor from the compressor mixed with the oil applied to the air feed caused the two problems. The piston which drives the nails became fouled with the water-oil mix and would not retract fully and prevented the next nail to feed properly. I first tried more oil, but that caused the unit to spray excess oil from the top of the unit (causing a light oil mist on anything in the area of the floor). I think I fixed the problem by cleaning the unit (it had about 200 sq ft total at this time) and adding an inline filter to the compressor. Other than that, I am very happy with my unit and ""field stripping"" it is not difficult..."
3,Keep it loaded,"You MUST keep it loaded when using it. On the last nail it would jump and ram a nail through the face of the board, wasting it unless that part could be cut off and the rest used as an end piece. I'm not sure why it did it but it was very frustrating having to pull boards up."
5,Porter Cable Floor Nailer,"After 700 sq foot of 5/8 inch engineered floor I have to say that this is one great tool. I did add a few shims to get the nailer to sit properly on the 5/8 material, but it has worked flawlessly since. I second the advice to make sure you don't fire the last nail as it may go askew. Give it a good whack and just keep on laying the hardwood."
2,Has Issues,This cleat nailer has a number of issues...After laying down about 500 sf of flooring the nailer failed... but since it wasn't used much during the warranty period it wasn't covered. When we opened the top there were a number of broken pieces. We sent it out for repair to a recommended repair facility... it only took 5 weeks to get the parts... there was a small list. $125 later... I just finish installing about 60 sf and it failed again. It will be a while before I take it to the shop again as I replaced it with a Bostich. The second issue has to do with what happens when it runs out of cleats. Rather than just using the last one and then doing nothing... it inevitably embeds the last cleat into the side or top of the board you are trying to fasten. I hate to think how many floor boards I ruined. The nailer looks nice... but it isn't up to Porter Cables usual high standards... don't waste your money.
1,get something else...anything else but this,"After Listening to this again I have changed my rating from 2 stars to 1 star. Although the Chicago Symphony is considered one of the ""Big 5"" american orchestras, this performance is wretched. One reviewer referred to the ""thudding timpani""... Yeah, they thud alright, but I think they sound more like if you punch someone in the gut and listen to the sound they make when they cough afterwards. This is not Chicago at their best. Good Chicago= Mahler 6 with Abbado. Good Tchaik. 4 ? Who Knows... I haven't heard a recording to run out and buy yet, but I know its not this one."
1,horrible,"After listening to 13 recordings of this piece and hearing it live several times, this is BY FAR the worst tempo interpretation I've ever heard. It more resembles high-school marching band than a major American symphony. The opening brass motive is completely run over. It's one of the best phrases in music liturature and it was killed by the third note! The other movements all resemble themselves in tempi. No thought was put into dramatic or emotional consideration. Way to kill a great piece. I'd feel too guilty to sell my copy to some unsuspecting soul, I think I'd rather burn it. My worst fear is that there are people out there who have never heard this piece before and hate it because of this irresponsible recording."
4,"perhaps there are better ones , but this one is very okay","perhaps there are better ones , but this one is very okay"
3,worth seeing,"This is one of Jet Li's earliest efforts in Hong Kong before he became a star as Wong Fei Hung. The story is about a wushu team on tour in San Francisco, and one of them defected. Jet li got stranded and got lost in the US while trying to find him. The plot is simple enough but there is a lot of fast realistic type of fighting more in the mold of Jackie Chan and Sammo Hung. In this movie, Jet Li use wushu and san da styles. If you like Jet li, you will enjoy this movie. Also stars his now wife Nina Chi, and Hong Kong funnyman Chow Sing Chi."
4,Great performance by young Jet,"Young jet li pulls a very good performance in this movie about awushu performer who gets stuck in San Francisco because of his friend who joins the local mafia gang and a series of event turns them against each other leading to an excellent final showdown. The martial arts sequences are very good and wireless.What keeps this movie from a perfect 5 stars is the incredibly bad acting from the americans actors and too much bad language. But if you can get through that, this is a movie worth your money."
5,The 'perfect' keyboard,"I have had several of these and would definitely suggest this to anyone with arm and wrist pains due to extensive and repetitive typing. The shape of the keyboard helps alleviate the pains. It is larger than your typical keyboard, so make some space on your desk. Also, this has a PS2 connection, so you will need a PS2 to USB cable if you are going to use it with new machines that only have USB ports (like Dells)."
2,"Good book, I don't recommend buying the Kindle version","I like this book and have bought it in hard copy for relatives but made the mistake of buying my copy in electronic form. Unfortunately the index in the electronic version does not have page numbers therefore rendering the index useless. One of the things I really like about this book is being able to find out about an issue/health problem in a very efficient way; not having a workable index, for me, makes the electronic version fairly useless."
3,"Good reference book, I guess",Crosses the line sometimes into the food Nazi realm and making the good you eat a religous statement of shaman kind.
3,still learning and looking,I am still looking and learning this book. Lot of info to look through and I just haven't had time.
3,Nothing really new.,"This offers nothing new and a lot of regurgitaed opinions taken from a host of sources. From a spiritual aspect, our body has the power to convert what is eaten to what the body needs if one believes in their power to do so. The medical establishment and the meat and dairy business would have us believe otherwise."
1,The optimum nutrition bible,"This man who presents himself as an authority on nutrition is extremely dangerous. Without any reservation, I consider him a quake. His ""knowledge"" is largely anecdotical and questionable as the least. Furthermore the man has a vested interest in advising supplementing with huge quantities of vitamins and minerals. He has his own brand. Growing up, I never took any vitamin or mineral supplements on a regular basis. On the odd occasions that I had any need for nutritional support, I went to my doctor for controlled supplementation of limited dosage.Don't buy this book! Rather look at ""You are what you eat"" by Kirsten Harvig and let food be your medicine. Listen to traditional wisdom.You've been warned. Keep away from this dangerous quake!If I could have gone any lower, I'd have given this book and author zero stars."
3,"Nice, but too long for male dogs","This sweater is really warm and looks great. However, it is very long and for male dogs the creates a problem. My male yorkie looks awesome in it, but he gets really frustrated from it hitting his you-know-what. I have tried to fold it over but it is too thick to stay in place. Would be nice for a female."
1,Nothing Special,"Warning, this is a really small sweater, Tiny would have been more appropriate. I have a Puggle and it went round her neck like a scarf. Also, Its made in China so its not Irish or Irish Wool..."
4,A little sappy but it's pure Jimmy D,"September Song mixes Jimmy Durante's gravelly voice and the softly dramatic strings so common during Durante's day. The result is pure Durante. If you love his music, you'll know most of these songs, if you're new to Jimmy Durante this is worth a listen."
1,Working with celebrities doesn't make you and expert,"I find it discouraging to find that a book can be written by someone on the topic of maternal fitness without any educational expertise, just experience working with celebrities who are hardly of average fitness ability. Postpartum women deserve better."
4,Excellent Case for Canon Powershot,"Perfect fit for my Canon Powershot. This little case traveled all the way to Brasil with me, and did a great job protecting my fragile Powershot. The case perfectly fits a small, compact camera and is well-constructed."
1,Not worth a penny,"Unfortunately I live in Central America and can't return this product, otherwise I would. As far as I can tell it doesn't help reduce glare at all. What a waste of time and money getting it this far and it not help. Save yourself the trouble and get something else."
4,Great Learning Tool,"I bought this product for my young children to learn their mother's filipino language and I thought it was a good choice they watch it pretty frequently and use it for test, etc. I recommend it for all ages."
4,Silent Thunder was an excellent game in it's day,This was an excellent game back in 1995 or 1996 when it was released. It's one of a few A-10 games ever made.Now the graphics are quite dated and if you can actually get this game to work with Windows XP you're a miracle worker. This is a DOS/Window 95 game. While trying to install this game to my current system it didn't want to recognize my cd rom drives for some reason. The game installer would start to load but then I'd have issues. I got those sorted (basically told the installer to ignore the problems) but then it still didn't know what to do with my Geforce 7900GT. I eventually gave up trying to figure out why it wouldn't work.
2,not sure about this one,"I'll put it short and simple. If you'd like to see a bunch of people siting around talking about The Cure and occasionally seeing a very short clip of the cure playing live then this is the DVD for you! It also comes with an second disc which features recordings of a cover band playing cure songs. My advice is that your money could be better spent buying an actual cure CD or DVD, or probably just anything else."
1,Does Not Work,"This software is completely bogus. I bought it, loaded it, and it will not work. Can't create data base. I looked up the software (google) and found that I was not the only victim. Beware."
4,Great Product,This product is very user friendly. The quality is good for the price. I would recomend it to anyone.
2,buy each seperate for less.,"The twin pack is a bit of a rip since Amazon has each camera sold individually for $26.99 and the same deal on shipping so,why buy this twin pack?"
4,MSN Live not so easy. Skype great!,"I always find it puzzling how poorly some Microsoft products work with others. We tried to get the LifeCam up and running with MSN Live Messenger version 8.5.1302.1018 and had nothing but problems. Then out of frustration we tried Skype version 3.8.0.154 and everything worked seamlessly. As long as we use Skype instead of Messenger, this is a great product."
4,Great quality for the price,"I have been using this webcam for almost a year now and it is great. The two pack is a great value for only $10 more. Setup and use is a breeze. The mic is good. The picture quality is pretty good as well, but for the price, I haven't seen anything that compares.If you need a couple of webcams with decent picture quality for a great price, this is your item."
4,web cam,Relative easy to install. It provides reasonable video images for it's price. Works well with Live Messenger.
3,"Ok, but disappointed","The cameras in the two pack are nice and have a nice picture, but the microphones in my dual pack did not work. Even from two feet away with all the buttons turned up, I could never get them to work.Also the cd in my daughter's pack did not work and she had to get the software from microsoft.I do like the zoom featureThese are an ok product and I may have gotten a bad set, but I bought these to talk to my daughter and I am a bit disappointed. But that's what headsets with microphones are for :)"
2,Be aware,"Bought two packs and two out of four cameras had very bad video quality. Other two were OK. Tried on two machines (Vista and XP), drivers installed well. I do not know what was wrong but video was blurred both in Skype and MSN. I was very disappointed and sent two cameras back to Amazon."
3,Very focused book,"I was looking for a book that covered the wide range of topics pertaining to BLDC. This is not it!The book well presents the concepts and theory related to radial flux BLDC, but only touches (i.e. less than one page each) on axial flux and slotless motors, and I didn't find a single reference to coreless.There is almost 100 pages of repetitive simulation examples... yawn."
1,A good book!!!!!!!!???????,"The part on calculating inductances (gap, slot and end)that covers from pages 94 is totally wrong. The formula for slot reacatance has been copied from induction motor design books where the locations of the coils are different from induction motors with double layer windings. In addition because in PM motors the winding is always fractional slot, we cannot find a slot with both coil sides from the same phase; the writer has forgotten to include a factor to consider that the coil sides in the same slot belong to different phases.An accurate reader can easily find mistakes in all chapters."
4,Can't go wrong.....,"Have owned this piece for a couple of years now....is my standby to go with my ""little black dresses"". Have gotten many compliments on it from people who spend 10 times this much for a ""fun"" piece of jewelry. Have had no problems with clasp so far.... (knock on wood!)."
3,"what doesnt kill us, makes us stronger","the stark portrayal of the lead character and his erstwhile examination of his deep seated rascist feelings makes this film a must see for anyone who has asked the question ""am i okay?"". For the large number of us (me included!) who may have been beaten or molested at a young age or otherwise suffered emotional abuse due to being both a minority AND gay will feel vidicated by this film. Spring break is David Knell's ""White"" album."
3,"Spring Break.1983, Anchorbay DVD Release-Good Film.","Spring Break is a Fun Movie, Filmed on Location in Fort Lauderdale/Fort Lauderdale Beach,Florida. this was when Spring Break was a Major thing for South Florida,More So for Lauderdale/Broward County.when parties I heard were wild and out of hand.Cannot be compared to today's Spring Break specifically here in Miami/South Beach, where sadly an Uncontrolled ""Urban"" crowd,mainly out of towners take over the town. Were not talking about fights,but shootouts and stuff, definitely not what it used to be. This movie is of a bygone era,Several Scenes of Partial Nudity,and great scenes,at times not funny but still a Good movie Overall.Compare the Old Ft.Laud with today's .It's still nice and beautiful, but more quiet and sadly now A home for perverse and undesirable elements who once inhabited SoBe. This Movie along with Summer Rental, is High recommended!Enjoy!"
4,Very Funny.,"I just happened to catch this movie on HBO late last Friday night and I'm glad I did. Until I saw ""Spring Break"" I believed that ""Gymkata"" was the worst movie ever made. Although ""Spring Break"" is a comedy, almost all of the laughs are completely untintentional and the film itself is strangely homoerotic. One a positive note, fans of women with REAL body parts will enjoy the beach themed fun. No Botox, silicone, hair weaves, capped teeth or ... tans were used in the making of this film. If you are a fan of very bad movies, you will definitely enjoy this one."
3,This Movie Taught Me A Dang Lot!,"Spring Break is a dang sex comedy, that has more sex than comedy. It's never laugh out loud funny, but it sure does have a lot of dang skin. It also taught the true dang meaning of Spring Break. Growing up in Alabama, I always thought Spring Break meant breaking something in the dang springtime. But this dang movie taught me that Spring Break means partying, sex, and having a dang good time. Thank you, Spring Break. Thank you very dang much!"
3,The original Spring Break Movie....,"This was the movie that started a long list of bad copycat movies about guys and girls on the loose on spring break. The acting was good, if somewhat amateurish. The one bright spot for guys that are looking for gorgeous women in movies of this type, is the appearance of Corinne Alphen (who later married Ken Wahl of 'Wiseguy' fame), as the lead singer of the all girl band. She has never failed to be overwhelmingly stunning, simply by walking across the set. This movie is set above all the rest of the grade Z copies in that there is actually a plot that the viewer can relate to, and you really believe in the relationship between the main characters. It is no surprise that it was never nominated for ANY award, but it is still a good movie."
5,Pure and Simple 80's Fun,"This is one of the best, and most under-rated, fun movies from the 80's (right up there with Night Of The Comet.) WHY ISN'T IT ON DVD YET?? My video is wearing out. You don't even have to be a guy to enjoy this one. I'm a 35 year old wife and mom and it's one of my favorite movies of all time. Maybe it's because I never got to do the whole wild Spring Break, much less ever party in the legendary Fort Lauderdale back in it's prime... but everytime I watch this movie, it takes me back to that wonderful decade and remember how much fun it was. The movie has tons of cheesy music, yes I walk around humming ""I wanna do it, do it, I wanna do it to you..."" 22 years later. Corrine was hot! Whoa... even the typical 'youth overcoming the evil adult' plot works here. And only in a movie like this would Nelson get a hottie like Susie."
5,Great movie!,"Cool, it's about time Spring Break is being released on dvd. My old vhs tape is about worn out. Spring Break is one of the best movies that I ever watched. Nice scenery in the movie also. To bad they didn't have the deleted scenes on there or more nudity."
1,I love Paul Hardcastle,however this is the worst cd I ever heard broke my ears and awful to listen to sold on half.com took the loss
2,Awful!,"1 star just for playing the wonderful Sibelius and 1 more for the rarely performed Nielsen. However the performance and recording is just plain awful. The sound is flimsy and detached, none of the brooding, icy fire that I usu. enjoy in this music. The Oistrakh version still reigns supreme at the moment."
1,I had to get rid of this CD,"I cannot imagine a more sloppy recording of these two masterpieces. I had to get rid of the CD after the first hearing - it was simply too embarrassing to have in my collection.For the Nielsen Concerto go to Emil Telmanyi and the Royal Orchestra conducted by Tango on Danacord. The Sibelius has several good recordings, my favourite is Ferras with the BPO and Karajan (Sibelius himself said about Karajan that he was the only conductor who really understood his music)."
2,Not good.,I don't know how Vengerov thought out this interpretation of the Sibelius. It is completely awful. It never makes sense and seems to go exactly in the opposite way than one would expect. I'm sure Vengerov is capable of producing a much better version. Maybe in another 20 or 30 years!!! The Nielsen does go a bit better.
3,Very strange.,"Maxim Vengerov is a great player, that's why I'm giving this cd 3 stars. His interpretation of this piece, however, is not very good. I recommend buying Nigel Kennedy's Just Listen cd for a better recording."
1,Quiklite Dashlite,"The light worked fine, but after a few charges, it will not hold a charge and is therefore useless. I would recommend buying something else."
2,useful literature review - poor textbook,"I used this book as a text for a graduate psychology of education course at the University of Akron where the author teaches.We probably used this text because the author has control over the course.The book reads very much like a literature review in a doctoral thesis. If it ever comes out in a second edition, the author should find a decent editor to rewrite it. The style is murky and tedious. The illustrations are crude.All the key points in this book are covered with greater clarity in any of the standard psychology of learning textbooks along with lists of the key research articles.If you need to do a literature review in this field, the book could save you a lot of time."
2,Poor Photography,"Kauai is a beautiful island and words alone aren't enough to convey this. As such, any book on Kauai needs great pictures to complete the message. Unfortunately, this book contains black and white, low-resolution pictures. In some cases, you can hardly make out the object of the picture.The poor quality of the pictures earns it poor ratings. The words may be fine, but words alone aren't enough in a book about Kauai."
1,Don't judge a book by it's cover,"The book i received has the Kauai Mile by Mile cover, but the contents are ""Embarking on the Mariposa Trail"""
2,Does not charge the battery in the camera as the description implies,"CAMERA AC ADAPTER FOR CANON POWERSHOT ACK-600 CA-PS400 CA-PS500 A40 A75 A85 A95 A610 A620 A630 & A640 4.3V 2AI purchased this product after reading its description and its ability to charge the battery in the camera. After receiving the product (it had no instructions enclosed) I contacted Canon and researched whether or not it could do so. Apparently there is no way for it to recharge the battery, it can only be used as an adapter when you wish to use your camera in close proximity to an outlet (i.e.: loading images to computer or viewing on T.V.) I am so disappointed that it did not perform as described."
5,Nice lancet with disposable cap,The lancet works well and comes with a cap to cover the needle for disposal.
1,wrong thing,"was not what I thought and does not fit my machineso i have not used them, but they are not returnable"
4,Good,"Satisfied, well in time; nicely packed. Met my expectation; will recommend to other people. Job well done by you guys."
3,O.K.,This item is O.K. but the box has shop wear on it. It looked like this has been around for a long time.
1,I have been cheated by amazon.com,"I have ordered One Touch Ultra 2 Blood Glucose Monitoring System, from Amazon.com. Amazon.com recommends the LifeScan OneTouch Ultra Soft Sterile Lancets (100 Lancets), along with the Blood Monitoring System. I tried to use this Lancets but this is incompatible with the Monitoring device. I have returned the product and reported this to Bargain OTC. But they are not ready to credit my amount, as I have opened the packet. Now I lost my money.Why incompatible products are being recommened by Amazon.com and putting customers into difficulty?"
1,Doesn't work with OneTouch UltraMini,"I have bought OneTouch UltraMini Glucose Monitoring System as a gift and took LifeScan OneTouch Ultra Soft Sterile Lancets as they claimed to be compatible.Guess what ... IT DOESN'T WORK.I am really unhappy with the purchase and since its a gift, I don't have it with me to return it."
1,Wrong description - they don't work with all OneTouch,"It seems that most OneTouch meters ship with Delica lancing device, and these lancets DO NOT work with Delica. The description is misleading in stating that they work with all One Touch. Since you open the package and one lancet before realizing, return is tough. I'm sure they had plenty of complains..."
1,Beyond Pathetic,"Since only one person has reviewed this and given it 5 stars I feel a moral obligation to even the scale.Allen in Europe had access to an incredible stable of musicians. Here in New York, Gomelsky hooked Allen up with a bunch of Gong-fanboys with expensive haircuts who would later call themselves Material and continue making bad records.You cannot listen to Angel's Egg with its world-class players and NOT cry when you hear this. Basically this is a piece of polycarbonate plastic.Yes, I hate it."
1,Over the Top,This movie would lead you to believe you can not Kiss before marriage.... We are a Christian Family I've been married to my wife for 43years... our Children have both been married long a time. one for16years the other for 11years My wife and I waited until we got married.. however we did Kiss..... This Movie is Over the TOP....
4,"Purity, Purity, Purity!","Perhaps the purest film on the planet, this movie is a MUST SEE for girls 10-13 years old. Enough said."
2,It is not worth the price,My baby did not enjoy this mobile. It cost too much money for what it does.
2,great colors but poor performance,our 3 month old seems to like looking at the colorful animals/pattern but this mobile does not seem to be very MOBILE! the battery life lasts only about a day or two! we gave up constantly changing batteries and it's now just hanging over the changing table. maybe we just got a defective machine but i would recommend the SASSY developmental mobile over this one any day!
1,Unable to use with crib & broke within 5 minutes!,"I was excited to use this mobile, but was disappointed when I realized with a ""sleigh"" crib, the mobile will not fit with the curved railing. I had to install it on the back of the crib, in which case the remote is unusable. After 5 minutes it broke! Would not move nor play any music. I went to the store and got a fisher price mobile for $20 less, it plays music, lights up and has a quieter setting that is actually calming for the baby!The remote is great, you can use it anywhere near the mobile since the sensor is right on top. I love this mobile, do yourself and the baby a favor and find this one (not sure of the name- I tossed the box already!)"
1,Broken motor within minutes of set-up,What a waste of money... so sad that the motor never worked with this model. Don't waste your money and time.
1,very disappointed,"We have now been through two of these. I will return the second today. With the first one, it would only play music after the first day. There was no motion. With the second-- the mobile portion has fallen in the crib three times. Fortunately my son was not in the crib when it did this. At first I thought it was because I assembled it incorrectly, but it is just faulty. I will return it today and will not get a new one."
5,A MUST FOR EVERY BABY!!,"I discoverd the Tiny Love mobile when my son was 4 months old. It is the best! The tilt of the mobile is such a fantastic idea. My son loved this mobile - invaluable! Now, my 2nd baby is due in April and I have purchased the remote control version. What a wonderful upgrade! I tell all my friends - if they only get one shower gift it should definitely be this mobile. Thanks Tiny Love. I haven't had any problems with the product breaking and I have given away 3. Don't compromise on $$. This is a must have."
1,Try another one,My baby liked this mobile but unfortunately it broke after a couple weeks and would no longer spin. It now only plays music intermittently even with the battery changes. It was a gift so we had no receipt and unfortunatley threw away the box so the store would not take it back. I see from other reviews that people are having similar problems. Try your luck or try another mobile.
1,Disappointed in L.A.,"My wife and I were excited about this mobile. Our daughter also responded favorably to it until...within 2 weeks we heard a loud grinding sound while it was on and now only the music plays, it does not turn at all. We were very disappointed and would return it however we threw out the box. Oh well, live and learn. Don't buy this. There are better ones out there."
3,new mom,"my two month old seems to enjoy the music and the bold colors/shapes of the mobile. however, i think she has a hard time falling asleep to it because the plastic pieces that's attached at the top make a lot of noise as it turns. so i placed a twisty so the pieces don't move and she seems to relax quicker. i also registered for this particular mobile because it has a remote control but it doesn't work from a distance unless you point to it directly at close range. so i would recommend saving a little bit of money and get the symphony-in-motion without the remote control."
4,Ghost Machine,"I do like this mobile a lot. However, we got a bad one or else we have a ghost in the house that likes to turn it on when ever they feel like it. I called the company and they were VERY nice and are sending out a new one. I really hope it works because it's a nice mobile and exactly what I was looking for!"
5,Excellent mobile and company,"Just wanted to take the time to say how great the customer service was with Tiny Love. I am using this for my second child now. My daughter loved this mobile when she was a baby. We never had any problems with it. When I got it out of storage to use for my son, I had problems putting it back together. After calling customer service, I was sent all new pieces (basically getting a new mobile) at no cost to me. With so many problems with other companies, knowing you get great customer service with this product is reason enough for me to pony up the money to buy it. This mobile is also very color-rich and has great music. The detachable music box is another great feature. Babies grow out of these types of things so fast. Being able to use the music seperately from the mobile is a wonderful bonus."
2,"Great mobile, lousy quality","It's a beautiful mobile, and really well designed to interest the baby. Unfortunately, the build quality is terrible. We're currently on our third mobile... and this one just stopped working as well. It's not that we're using it too heavily, either. We use it perhaps one hour a week."
2,DISAPPOINTED,"A remote mobile--great idea! I love the way the colorful characters dance, and the music is soothing. However, the unit does not sit well on the crib. The arm moves with the weight of the unit so it is not over the mattress. My husband ""rigged"" it so it would sit properly, but you should not have to. This is our 2nd Tiny Love mobile; the first I thought was a lemon and returned it. When we turn the new mobile on, the arm falls off, usually hitting the baby. I have sent my complaint to Tiny Love. Hopefully this doesn't happen to you."
1,Lasted 4 minutes,"Wow, what a great looking mobile. My wife and I thought the price a bit high but decided to take a chance. What a mistake!!! The mobile stopped turning before the first song ended. To add to my misery, we live over an hour away from the closest ... store (where we went specifically for a new mobile) and the local [store] refuses to take it back. Do not buy this ...!!"
2,Big disappointment.,This mobile came highly recommended and we were so happy with it for 7 weeks. Then the mobile stopped spinning. I called Tiny Love and was told by their customer service representative that my complaint was a common one and that they would send me a replacement piece. The replacement piece never arrived. This product quickly went from being my favorite baby gift to something I wouldn't recommend to anyone. It would be great if Tiny Love could solve the spinning problem because it's such a good idea and my son loved it while it lasted.
1,Motor never worked.,"We received this as a gift, set it up, got the music playing, but the motor never worked."
1,What a disapointment!!!,I can not express how disapointed I am in this mobile. We got it for our 3 month old son for Christmas and he loved it. The first reason I bought it was so I could turn it on from the hall without him seeing me. Well that was disappointment #1 because you have to turn the remote on from the base. The next disapointment came 3 weeks after Christmas when it just stopped working. There are now 2 new brands of these mobiles out and I would highly recommend checking into them before you purchase this product.
3,TROUBLE AT FIRST,"I fell in love with this mobile, especially do to the remote feature (which I rarely used). When we received it from our registry, we installed it, and my son loved it. Then trouble started....it really didn't fit our crib properly, the arm never stayed in the same place (it seems too heavy for the unit). The final straw was when the arm would fall off and hit the baby. I returned the unit, thinking it was a lemon. When we brought the new mobile home, it started again. I called Tiny Love, who said they were getting complaints, and sent me a new arm. It works now; and he still loves it. I'm glad that Tiny Love fixed the problem, and I'm sure the products on the shelves now have the ""new"" arm."
1,Flimsy Mobile!,"My husband purchased this mobile so I wouldnt have to wind up the mobile that matches my babys nursery every minute. My baby absolutely loved this mobile, and it gave me some time to get a few things done. I have been fortunate that the mobile hasnt stopped working. My problem is, I put my baby down in the crib, turned the mobile on, and went downstairs to get some breakfast. When I came back upstairs she was screaming bloody murder. To my suprise, the clip on peice (with the animals) fell on her face! I am completely outraged and dissapointed with this product. How safe can it be if you leave the room for a minute and peices are falling off of it onto your baby?!"
4,Needs stronger motor ( Excellent cust. service - tiny love),Our daughter loved this mobile - the music and the rotating animals. The only drawback was that the motor was not strong enough to rotate the mobile after the third day ( the music was playing though). We exchanged it and the same thing happened with this one too - the music played on but the motor stopped spinning after the fourth day.We called tiny love and explained the problem and they sent us a replacement control unit within the next couple of days. This was Excellent customer service and we were surprised because the previous comments suggested that they were indifferent if not bad customer service.You can call 888-TINY-LOVE and just explain it to them. BTW someone mentioned that it was in illinois but thank god(for us) it was local somewhere in california.I didnt give 5 stars not because of the product but because I had to go through the hassle of exchanging twice and finally calling the customer service (excellent though it was).
5,The Most Fun for Your Baby,"I bought this mobile after my 10-week-old noticed the one her cousin had from across the room. When I got it home she went absolutely wild watching her little animal friends and listening to the music. It's adorable to see and hear her shrieking and wiggling happily for loooong stretches of time - at least enough for me to get a few things done around the house. The only problem is that the first mobile I bought developed a loud squeak after about 2 weeks and stopped turning after about 4 weeks. Frtunately, Babies R Us is great with returns and exchanged it for me. No problems with the new one so far after about one month of use. This mobile is one of the best things we bought for our baby."
1,motor broke after just 2 uses,"I received this mobile as a shower gift. Before she began sleeping in her crib last week (at 10 weeks-old), we would lie her in the crib with the mobile moving above her and watch her smile and laugh at it -- she really seemed to enjoy it. After doing this only twice, the motor just died. We replaced the batteries, but nothing would make it work again. So, before her first night of sleeping in the crib, the mobile was already broken!! She does continue to look at the colors and shapes but, needless to say, we are extremely disappointed in this product."
2,TOO STIMULATING!,"In my opinion mobiles are supposed to be entertaining, but in a mellow way. They're supposed to RELAX a baby and help her go to sleep. This mobile is soooo busy w/ its multitude of animals and colors and music and motion that it makes my baby HYPER and overstimulated. NOT good for helping a baby go to sleep AT ALL. However, it is good for 10 or 15 minutes of entertainment while you catch a quick shower or get something quick done!"
4,"Great, but save money - skip the remote control!","Our 3 1/2 month old son loves the Symphony in Motion mobile, even when it's not moving. The colors and shapes are very stimulating for little eyes and minds. Don't expect this mobile to put the baby to sleep, however - it's more for keeping the baby entertained for 15 minutes or so while you shower or do things around the house. My only major complaint is that I bought the one with the remote, thinking that it would work from our bedroom. The outside package did not mention that you have to be standing no farther from the crib than in the doorway of the nursery to make it work. (That piece of news didn't come until I had opened the box and read the instructions!) Hence, I spent $10 extra for the deluxe version with the remote, but I've never used the remote once. I'd recommend getting the model without the remote."
3,Great mobile but very poor design,"My baby loved this mobile. It has great colors and movement that entertained my baby for hours, but it is designed poorly. I read the other reviews and decided I would get this one and tape it so it didn't fall off on my baby's head. After purchasing it, I could see how it could easily fall off because of the poor design. Secondly, it is a bit bulky and hard to set up. Thirdly, I would save the money and not get the remote control. It is a joke. I never even used it because it didn't work to turn the mobile on, all it did was switch songs. Last this mobile just quit working after a month of use. The motor just quit.I rated this mobile a 3 just because of its great color, movement, and music, but the design quality is a 1."
5,best mobile on the market,"Worth the money! Our baby was very difficult in the beginning, and this was one of the only things that would entertain her. It bought us 15 minutes of free time, and we knew she was content to listen to the classical music and watch the mobile. Best of all, it comes with a remote control so the baby doesn't even see you start it up again."
2,"Stimulating to look at, but...","I LOVED this mobile from the box, but out of the box, it just didn't work as I had hoped:1.) Our crib is slightly curved on the ends, so it was a challenge findng a safe place for it to mount without damaging the crib.2.) As the next review says, there are two volumes: loud and medium. I had to put masking tape over to speaker to make it bearable for a sleepy baby.3.) When it is spinning, there are little squares that slide down the mobile. Cute concept, but they make an awful racket that isn't even rhythmic.4.) Like the review below, ours stopped spinning after a very short time in use. I didn't really mind, though because it stopped the scrapping noise of the little squares and let me just play the music.In concept, this is a beautiful toy, and broken or not, my daughter still loves to look at the spirals and the toys. We have many Tiny Love toys and she enjoys them all, but this particular one has some bugs to work out."
3,"It is ""okay""...","First and foremost, the music puts ME to sleep. It is very soothing. There are a few things I don't like about the mobile. The volume only has two settings-high and low. It gets pretty loud and because it is in the crib, it can be pretty loud for a baby's ear. We've already started using it for our newborn, he may not see too far from his face, but he definitely can hear the sounds. The remote control is pretty handy, the only problem is you still have to get up and turn it on at the base before you can use the remote. Other moms of newborns have told me that the clicking sounds it makes from the toys sliding back and forth wakes their baby, but my baby just sleeps right through it. I guess it just depends on how much your baby can adapt to noise. Overall, it's big and a little over-stimulating, but the music is nice."
2,Same problems,"We also have a Morigeau-Lepine crib. I wish I read the other review before I registered for the regular version of this mobile. The only side it can be attached to is the one that goes up and down. Also, the sliding shapes seem to make a lot of noise, but I hear that's part of the entertainment."
5,Love this mobile,"This mobile has great colors, is very interesting and totally captivates the attention of my 10 week old. It has nice music (not too mechanical or tinny sounding) and plays for a good amount of time - about 15 minutes. I love to look at it too!I haven't had any of the mechanical problems that others have mentioned, but have noticed that sometimes if the mobile doesn't want to move, I just need to adjust it by moving the mobile unit in the stand (that attaches to the crib rail) just a little to the left or right. The mobile will start back up at that point."
2,watch for falling parts,"my child loves this mobile, but the mobile unit will just randomly become unattached and fall on my baby -- i would be very leary."
2,"I liked it, my daughter did not...","I thought it was great, but my 4 mo old would not even look at it. Developmentally, it is a great concept, but she didn't seem to care. Put her in front of her plain, but not all that ""developmentally correct"" Pooh mobile, and she is facinated! Go figure. Guess the developmental experts forgot to ask her opinion! I would say wait to buy it until your baby is here and try it out. If they don't like it you can try with another one. Babies can be very picky and it is pretty expensive.One positive...the music lasts for 15 min. Most mobiles wind and quit running quickly. This one goes on for a while, so if your baby likes it, it will last for a good amount of time."
1,Another Faulty Mobile,My baby loves this mobile. I loved the colors and all the movement as well. I spent a lot of time looking for just the right mobile before I finally decided on this one. The other day I put my daughter in her crib and started up the mobile when nothing would soothe her and I needed a break. Wow! The mobile really did the trick. She was transfixed and calm . . . until it stopped moving. The music continued to play but all the motion stopped. This was only the fourth time I had turned the mobile on. From the sounds of other's reviews I would save the money and buy another mobile.
5,He's fascinated,"Our 8 week old baby loves this thing much better than another mobile we bought. He watches all the activity for as much as 30 minutes. Sometimes he just turns and faces the speaker to simply listen to the music. This mobile keeps him occupied and seems to soothe him. If he is awake, he loves to watch the little animals rising and falling in a circular pattern. It did not help him sleep at first, but he's now used to it and seems to focus on the soothing music when he's going to sleep. He even smiles at the music box.I do not believe there is another mobile quite like this series by Symphony-in-Motion."
1,Motor quit after 4 times of use,"It's bright and my daughter loves watching it. However, it stopped turning after only using it 4 times. I returned it and got a new one. If this one does the same thing or falls on my daughter like other customers have reported, I'm getting something else. If I were you, don't even buy this to begin with. Half the reviews on this are negative."
2,not worth the money,"While my daughter really enjoyed looking at this mobile, it is cheaply made, and I can't believe they charge [item price] for it. The head part never really attached very securely and fell off into the crib quite a few times. At 3 1/2 months it came off, and would not stay back on at all, so I had to throw it away. The spinning part also stopped spinning at this point. It also used batteries like crazy. We only really used it like once or twice a day for 10 or so minutes, and we were changing the batteries every few days.I would not recommend this product at all unless they get a clue and construct it better!"
2,not worth the money,"My daughter really loved watching this thing, but I am not happy with it at all. The hanging part never really attached well, and occasionally fell off onto her little head. Now, at 3 1/2 months, it won't stay attached at all, and I have just thrown it away. In addition, I was constantly changing the batteries!!No way is this thing worth [money amount]"
3,battery eater,"my child (4 months) loves this mobile and likes for it to play as he goes to sleep and thus we are constantly changing the batteries at least once a week. Also, we bought this mobile because of the remote feature so that in the middle of the night we could turn the mobile on without disturbing our son. BUT the remote function only stays on for a predetermined amount of time so if the baby woke up 5 hours later we still had to go in and start the mobile because the the remote feature had turned itself off."
5,EXCELLENT DEVELOPMENTAL MOBILE!,"After reading about this mobile in baby magazines, we knew this was the one. The colors are bright and vibrant with contrasting stripes and polk-a-dots - just what an infant needs to develop his senses. The mobile turns at an angle which helps baby develop his/her perception abilities. The classical music is very soothing. We've used the remote a few times and it comes in handy to not allow you to disturb your baby while you restart it. I recommend this to everyone!"
1,dissapointed,"I Received this mobile as a shower gift. Excited I tried it out for a couple of days, by the third day the motor had stopped working on the mobile. I called BRU to inquire about this problem. She stated that she had had two returns this week about the same problem I am encountering. I am going to exchange it for a different product."
1,Don't waste your money!!,"I purchased this mobile for my little one thinking it would be a slam dunk. Pretty colors, remote control, several classical tunes... well, it would be perfect if it worked. It broke the same evening I put it together. Though the music played, the mobile didn't go around as it was supposed to. I contacted Tiny Love and they sent me replacement parts, but it still didn't work. I ended up returning it to BRU. Reading the other reviews I guess I was not the only one with the same problem. I do give it one star because it is pretty... but that's about it! :-)"
1,Doubly Disappointed,"I received this mobile at Christmas time as a gift and was enthralled with the colors, music, and overall mobile movement. Then 2 weeks later, it stopped spinning. I changed the batteries...no spin. I took it completely apart...no spin. I wiggled it, giggled it...no spin. SO, I took it back to the store and exchanged for a brand new one. Guess what: NO SPIN!!!!!!!!!! I'm so disappointed. I won't be trying a third as I really believe that would be ridiculous. And after reading several of these online reviews, apparently mine is not the only one. Too bad.The only reason I am giving this 1 star is because there isn't an option for 0 stars."
3,Don't bother with the deluxe model,"I got this mobile as a gift. Our baby loved it's eyecatching colors and multiple types of motion. It's lovely to look at. The musical pieces are good, though the music quality could be better. But baby didn""t mind! A few things bugged me. They should make it height adjustable so you don't have to give it up once baby starts trying to get up on his own. Also I would like to run the mobile without the music. Mostly, don't spend the extra [money] on the deluxe model. The remote control (the only difference between them) doesn't work properly. You have to press a button to engage it and by the time you want to use it again it has disengaged. This forces you to use the buttons attached to the crib each time - so the remote is essentially useless. And it's one more piece of junk you have to find space for. Overall, it's a nice mobile, one of the nicer I've seen."
2,It's great until....,"Our son loved this mobile, then it started making a strange noise when it turned so we exchanged it for a new one. What a mistake, I would have taken listening to the hounted house creek over having to return mobile on a weekly basis. I belive we are now on our 6th mobile. They work at first but then they just stop turning. We have called the company and tried everything. I would never buy this product, but our son loves the animals and the colors so much that I just keep exchanging it. I can't wait until I can take it out of his crib!"
5,A great mobile!!!,"I have been using this mobile for the last 10 1/2 months, and my daughter loves it! It keeps her attention, and she has actually fallen asleep while watching it. I mostly use it now for the classical music, and love the remote feature. I just remove the arm and the music relaxes her to sleep. I've been doing this all along, and have never had any problems with it falling down! If installed correctly, you shouldn't have any problems. The sound is nice, too (although sometimes I wish it was just a little quieter - even on the softer setting). It is a little more expensive, but I've gotten almost a years use out of it, and I expect that my daughter will continue to enjoy the music. I highly recommend this mobile!!!"
2,It didn't work,We purchased this mobile after our whoozit mobile broke. This one was so interesting turning in motion in several different ways. ONLY THE MOTOR WOULD NOT WORK!!. Also it seems very dangerous for the arm. I feel it could fall out very easily. My baby loved to look at the strong contrast too bad it never worked.
2,two broken motors- Babies r us admits problems with co.,I love this mobile but gave up on it when I returned the second one because the motor broke again. It also takes a lot of batteries also and is really loud. If you live near a babies r us and keep the recept go ahead and buy it since its great when it works. But- it will break- even the girls at babies r us have said that they are having trouble with the company.
4,incredible,This book is wonderful! I thoroughly enjoyed every aspect. You see the relationship between these two boys and you see yourself and your younger sibling that looked up to you in such a way. You just want to call them up and apologize for every time you beat them up or every time you told on them. This book really makes you stop and think about how important your brothers and sisters are. I personally feel closer to my sister just because of this book. I was Sucker trying to be just like my sister and now I know why she did what she did. I also now that she is sorry for all those times that we weren't particularly pleasant towards each other. This is an amazing piece of work and I recommend it to anyone that was or has a younger sibling.
4,Great phones for monitoring live recording....,"I use these for monitoring live concert recording, and have for years. First, I used these on a Sony Walkman Professional D6c cassette recorder, then on an Archos Jukebox Recorder, and now on a Minidisc recorder.. great at giving you a true representation of what is being recorded and blocking out external sounds that are not being picked up by the mics (i.e. the idiot yelling 'rock & roll' next to you). These are not equivalent to the $500-$750 phones I used when doing recoding studio training, but for $20, they are a very worthwhile investment. By needs are phones that are cheap, give a true representation, and these are PERFECT for that. One great feature is the 'reversible ear cup' that lets you swivel the cup and listen without having to put on the full phones."
4,"Good for price, but not excellent headphones.","These are a great deal for the price. But they just don't make it if you want great sounding headphones, there isn't really enough clarity, plenty of bass though. If you are listening to music they are great, but not very good headphones for movies where you want to here good vocals. And but if your not using these for a movie or TV they are a great value. And just one more note, they don't squeez your head or hurt your ears unless you wear them for over 4 hours (and my friends call me ""big head"" too)."
4,loved this,these headphones were great quality and they worked very well in my music studio. i have since upgraded to the newer edition and they all still work the same.
4,Sounds good but very flimsy,"I purchased this headphones - I really liked the way it sounded. Its not amazing but its quite fine, considering that I paid less than 20 dollars. This was a good alternate to the ridiculous earphones (read ""apple"") which don't even sit in my ears. The earpads are good. The wires are ridiculously long that sometimes I kept tripping over them. Once I accidentally tripped over the wire, and the ear cup broke! Then I went to amazon and ordered one more for less than 20 dollars. In three months, that one broke too. Both incidents were normal; of course, I do understand that if I hit this hard, it will break. The construction of these headphones, I feel is flimsy. I really like this and will recommend it, provide you will take care of this like a new born or dont be heartbroken if it breaks. I have moved on to Audio Technica now!"
4,Love these headphones!,Just the right fit and they're great for listening to music from my desk in my cubicle at work. They work sufficiently enough to block out most noise.
4,Alright,"I cannot say these are the best out there, the headphones broke off easily for me but the adapter was very handy since I play the piano and a digital piano. it plugged right into my digital piano so I can play without disturbing people. The headphones were good quality, just be careful with them, and pray you don't have a young child lol."
2,Poor quality or rough use??,The plug end shorted out after only a few months. I bought a new plug from Radio Shack and the headphones are like new again.
4,Good headphones,"These are great headphones for the price. They are comfortable and they have great sound. They actually have some bass. The only problem is the chord is like really long so these are great for a studio, but the string can get in the way if you are just relaxing with them on."
2,"Great sound and comfort, doesnt last long","This product sounds great with good bass and balance, but after a week the left ear cup broke"
4,Great value!,"These headphones are an excellent value in the $15 - $20 range. They are a little snug on the head at first but will loosen up over time. Sound quality is very good although I did expect a bit more on the low frequency end but nothing to complain about. If you're the type that cannot where ear buds, these are something you really cannot pass up at this price."
2,It breaks easily,"Just get something around the sixty dollar range because this one broke after less than three months. I guess I get what I paid for. Since this doesn't have noise canceling this is nothing compare to regular ear buds. At the same time I should had used a pair of ear buds to listen to music when I am in the public. O yeah, the construction of the overhead sometimes pulled my hair, be aware of that. Like I said get a Sony with noise canceling, the collapsible one is amazing... cheap too!"
4,Very Good Set Of Headphones,"Overall, a very good set of headphones with great sound.Although these headphones are not your typical ""high-end"" model, you can still tell the quality that was built into theses headphones. I suspect reliability and dependability will not disappoint anyone. Sony has, and always will, continues to make first class electronics components. The only annoyance would be the bulky and rather thick headphone cord. I imagine it's for better sound reproduction. But it seems most of the thickness is coming from the rubber jacket and not the wire insulation. Earcups a little uncomfortable after extended wear time.Headphones received a ""Consumer Reports Best Buy"" rating, which usually effect my decision on a lot of electronic purchases.Would have given a 5 star except for the earcup problem."
3,Sound Quality is great. Design is HORRIBLE,I've had this headphone for quite a while now and I'm giving it only 3 stars because it hurts my ears after an hour of wearing it. The earcups seem kind of flimsy meaning that it looks and feels like it will break. So far it hasn't and I'm glad. Other than that its a good buy
2,Ouch!,These head phones sound fine. The problem is the pain that it causes to your ears. I tried them with and without earrings...didn't matter. My husband also did not feel like they were comfortable. I am sorry that I bought them!
3,"EARPHONES GREAT, BUT LET IN A LOT OF OUTSIDE NOISE!","These headphones work okay, and I guess you shouldn't expect much at the price. The sound from my DVD player is fine on them, but the headphones almost seem to amplify, or bring in, outside sounds when you're trying to watch a DVD. I bought them as an interim while I ordered noise cancelling headphones, and that's what they will be. I don't know how much they bleed sound out, but I have to view my DVD player away from any competing sounds. They fit pretty snug, too, so that's surprising! It's a plus that you can position the reversible earphones to fit in a portable DVD travel case."
2,unacceptable,Bought a few of these hoping to use them for a promotion. The sound is unacceptable. Extremely muddy and colored compared to the true monitors they would pretend to compete with. Now I have to return them. Sadness.
4,Great headphone value,"Forgot my headphones, so I bought these in St. Maarten on vacation for $40....worth every penny, though I would have saved a lot of money if I could've bought them from Amazon!Very good sound quality, although they are bigger and bulkier than buds. (duh!)"
2,Ouch,"I bought these headphones several years ago and use them regularly. The sound is passable for a pair of headphones at this price point. The bass response is not overly bloated like many cheap closed back headphones and they don't seem to color the source material very much. I have absolutely zero complaints about their audio performance. Can you get a better-sounding headphone at this price point? Probably. But these sound perfectly OK in my opinion.However, these are perhaps the most painful headphones I have had the displeasure to wear. I wear glasses and find that the earcups press my ears into the earpieces. After an hour or so, my ears feel abused. Even without glasses, I can only bear to keep these headphones on for about an hour.Overall, I cannot recommend these headphones due solely to the fact that they are not wearable for any extended period of time."
4,Excellently durable,"Technically, this is just a replacement (I hope) to the one I already have, but I've been very impressed with them. They've held up to a decade of abuse and still work pretty decently. The only thing I caution is don't let the cords around the earbuds and the cord leading to the 2.5/3.5mm jack get tangled or curled. It's a pain in the rear to try to straighten them out. This is why I am buying a replacement. However, all in all they are still worth the money paid.Though, if you're like me, you're probably gonna want to go with ""cordless"" at some point, but these are good for keeping outside noise out while you listen and drift away with the music. :)"
4,Good Headphones,These Headphones are a nice quality for the money. If you move around some the tend to make some audible external noise even at hi volumes. They are comfortable and overall a great set for the money. Sound quality is also pretty good for the price. I would buy these again for general round about use.
3,"Good sound and easy use, not comfortable","Like the other people say, the sound quality is great and a great value. But I find it hard to even wear these headphones for more than 30 minutes straight without getting an earache. If you are looking for comfortable headphones, you might want to avoid these."
4,Exceptional value for the price,"While by no means comparable to Sennheiser, this is a surprisingly good little headset for the money. I rate it superior to Grundig."
4,good headphones for the price,The sony Mdr-v150 headset is a good value for the price. I compared them to my other [coby] headset with my Ipod and I discovered notes that where missing on them. The cord is a bit too long for my taste. I accentaly broke the headband but was able to super-glue back together. Expect to pay between 15-20 $ for them
3,"They'er ""aight"".","I've owned this series of headphone for some odd reason, because they're not all that good, more than once. It's a quick fix. They're cheep, and do the job. But that's all they do.The highs aren't high. The bass is virtually non-existent. It's only so-so high point is the mid range, which isn't all that important compared to the other two items.The construction, as you'd expect by the price is very.. very cheep. I wouldn't be surprised if Sony started throwing these in cereal boxes for the free toy in a few years.I have to wear glasses, and during long listening sessions (over an hour) my ears began to hurt since these are an ""on the ear"" headphone. I wouldn't suggest these to anyone, regardless of price, if they wear glasses on a regular basis.I won't be buying another set. Ever."
2,Broke after four months,"I got these in May and the right channel just stopped working in September. Before that, they were okay as a pair of low end headphones for my laptop and stereo. Buy at your own risk. If you don't demand perfect sound quality (I'm not exactly an audiophile, either), these are decent. If they hold up. Otherwise, if you want something of greater quality and that is likely to be a better investment, you should be willing to part with more cash for a better pair, or look for cheaper low end pairs."
2,Dull and muffled.,"These headphones are fine for the average joe, but are a nightmare for the audiophile. The frequency range is small, and focuses on the bass. this is pretty bad for those who listen to the fast paced power metal, where the guitars are going off into the super high-pitched notes. These dumb down the sound and do not feel like they ""hug"" your ears. They should be sending a pure, surrounding sound that gives birth to all frequencies, instead of muffling them. after all, they are supposed to be monitors. they should atleast be able to provide a clearer sound. i am dissapointed."
3,Muddy-sounding,"The first thing I noticed is that they are very, very tight. I have a small head, but still they seem excessively tight. If you wear glasses, you might want to steer clear of these. I'm using these with my iPod, and without the EQ on, they sound incredibly muddy. The bass is okay, but they are completely lacking in the high end. They're very, very skewed towards the mid-range, so if you listen to any jazz or classical music, do NOT get these! They're probably pretty decent for pop, rap, and hip hop though.If you don't mind slightly larger cans but still want a low price, spring for theSennheiser HD 202 Headphones. They're much more comfortable and sound light years better than these. If you want portability (and don't mind open cans), I can't recommend theSennheiser PX 100 Collapsible Headphoneshighly enough. The difference between these and the PX100s is like the difference between listening to the radio and listening to a CD."
2,"decent headphone quality, but extremely uncomfortable","I bought these headphones for the purpose of listening to music/video and also to do some mixing with music recordings. I have to say, while I do like a lot of sony's earbuds for their sound quality and bass response, I was somewhat disappointed with this pair of headphones. Bass response was mediocre, not as powerful as my $10 earbuds surprisingly enough. The mids and highs seemed fine. However, these headphones were extremely tight and uncomfortable. I thought it would be good that they are tight and thus would keep a lot of sound out (which they do, but at a cost). After maybe 30 minutes to an hour my ears were aching a lot, so much that I had to take off the headphones and rest my ears for a while. With glasses it is even worse. Do not buy if you want headphones that you can keep on for long periods of time."
2,Eh,plastic hinges on the headphones are delicate and break easy. great sound though - really helps down out the coworkes
2,Headphones,I was not impressed with this item. The ear cups were too small and felt to tight on my ears. It seems to have a less than quality look about it. I would not buy a similar item from Sony.
2,Good While They Lasted,"I bought these headphones in September of 2007, they lasted until June of 2009.The plastic ""U"" that attaches the headpiece to the side cup cracked so now the left ear-cup is detached and dangling.I hate to throw things out but they finally bit the dust after two years.RIP Sony Studio Headphones, 06/05/2009"
4,OKay,sound quality good except for high frequencies (become a bit crunchy).. swivel ear pieces are sometimes annoying..
2,Works well sometimes,"I brought this item to listen to the radio and CDs at work. It sounds great at times. Sometimes though, I hear a'sizzle' sound from the left ear piece. This ""sizzle"" noise comes and goes....seems most apparent when listening to songs with loud bass. I was listening to Elvis when the ""sizzle"" became unbearable. In my anger I cranked the volume to the max, which made the ""sizzle"" sound go away and now it seems to sound ok again. Strange, very strange."
3,Great Headphones Only If You Take Breaks.,I have owned these headphones for a long time. But they do okonly if you doing brief mixes and for about 30 minutes. After that you may need to take a break from the station or studio since your ears will hurt from the pressurized padding.
2,Pain in the ear !,"I borrowed this headphone from the college library to view some DVD's on my notebook. While the sound quality is good and with little leakge to surrounding, the headphones are a real pain on the ears! You will definitely wear them outside the ear after 15 minutes of usage !These are the most uncomfortable headphone I have used. Please try something from sennheiser."
3,average set of head phones,"The sound quality is clear but not a lot of bass, just like other headphones that dont look studioish. The good thing about it is that it has the studio plug and the regular mini plug. Good b/c i have a sound system that only has the studio plug. Does muff out outside sound, which is good for the subway or airplane ride."
1,Worst headphones I've ever purchased,"Like another reviewer said, these are pathetic if the music has ANY bass to it. A muddy, distorted sound is what you get when you listen to anything with any volume.These are going back to the store TOMORROW!"
1,Horrible Headphones,"I purchased these headphones hoping that they would be an improvement over the set that came with my portable CD player. I brought them home and plugged them in with high hopes, and was sorely disappointed.The moment they touched my ears I knew it was trouble. Only buy these headphones if you like pain to go along with your music. The ear-cup foam is very hard and the headband is far too tight. Extremely uncomfortable.As for the sound - they are worse than the set that came ""free"" with my portable CD player. Weak bass, muddy vocals, no highs.These are Poser headphones. They look vaguely like the high end studio headphones used by sound engineers, but the similarity ends there.Not Recommended"
1,muy malos,la verdad ami no me gustaron estos audifonos. son mejores los sennheiser.la voz no esta tan clarita conparados con los sennheiser.
1,not worth the price,"These are cheap, and the sound quality matches the price. At certain volumes and/or frequencies the sound ""cracks."" Tinny high ranges, washed out lows. I traded my set in for a Koss solo set at about the same price. Not as comfortable (their major drawback), but with much better sound, and less background noise gets in. I'd definitely advise avoiding the Sonys in this price range. Tried a $49 Sony set at the store, however, and those headphones were comfortable and sounded very good. Get what you pay for..."
3,They keep your ears warm,"I was actually under the impression that these were active noise cancelling headphones. Please note that they are not. I'm sure they would have cost a lot more if they were but one site (it may or may not have been Amazon) did claim that they are... That was a disappointment because I want to use them while mowing my yard.All in all they are good headphones. The bass sounds fantastic and when used with my guitar amp, they sound incredible.The reason for the not-so-perfect review is the heat. The ear pieces are comfortable, plush leather but they make your ears too stinkin' hot. It's summer time now and I can't stand to wear them any more than about 25 minutes -- otherwise it feels like they're contributing to heat stroke. For what it's worth, I usually use ear buds so maybe this is how it is supposed to be with all over-the-ears but nevertheless, it has me looking for noise cancelling ear buds now..."
4,Great Value,"I bought these for $9.99 at TJMaxx so I wasn't expecting much, just needed a quick replacement. I was really surprised at how good they are, much better than the buds I had before. I think at $25 you are getting what you pay for - good earphones at a good price. They fit tightly but I assume they are meant to as they are well padded. They can cause sore ears after using them for a long period of time, it's only noticeable for a moment after taking the off."
2,Muddy Sound,"These are the muddiest sounding headsets I've ever owned. It helpsto add treble to your EQ settings, but that's not a perfect solution,either. It sounds like you've stuffed your ears full of cottonbefore you put them on. Everything else seems fine. Tough cord andconnections, nice fit, but I bought them so I could discriminatesounds. Everything blends together into mush. I'll have to go backand replace these with something else. If all you like is bass, getthem. The lows are bass, the highs are bass, the mids are bass. It'sa bassy mess. I paid $21."
2,Third pair is the last for me.,"These headphones are pretty good as far as sound goes - not precise, but balanced. But they don't fold at all, and the earcups are held in place by a flimsy plastic peg in the design, which breaks quite easy, as does the headband. I've had three, then, and all pairs have just broken in normal transit. I'm upgrading to Sennheiser HD 280 Pros or Grados, which have much more robust construction. The cheapness of these guys just doesn't offset the fact that I need a few pair every year or so."
2,break easily,"These headphones have really good sound for being so cheap and small, but they break very easily. Every pair i've owned of these (over 10) have either cracked in a crucial place or started to lose signal in the plug. The pair i have now has both of these problems."
2,"pretty good sound, but super uncomfortable","i got this to get better sound quality and on that it delivered.but they are super uncomfortable, maybe this is just for me but they hurt my ears. cant listen for more then 20 mins before ears start hurting.i rarely use for that reason"
2,Bummer! They BROKE!,"These were terrific - great sound, comfy - but they BROKE!! Gently used, just snapped off, unusable. SNAPPED OFF! Weird. All the ear buds and headsets that have come and gone, this has never happened."
5,Excellent Quality,"I have owned these for a year now. Just bought 2 of these for gifting.I always buy quality stuff even if it is expensive. Saw these first time at a colleague's desk, tried them in the extremely noisy lab and was impressed by the quality of sound. When I heard the price I was blown away. For that price you hardly get such quality sound. Usually Sony is irrationally expensive, but not this case.Pros:1) High quality bass. I am a bass lover, but I enjoy only the smooth bass. This one is prefect for my taste.2) Sturdy build. I have owned my set for a year now in a messy lab. It still looks new.3) Long enough cable. I usually listen on my notebook. I actually have to keep most of the cable folded.Cons:1) After a long stretch (3 to 4 hours) of use my ears ache a bit. That's normal I believe. After all, ears weren't built for the headphones! :)"
4,Good...for the price,"These headphones are very good for the price you pay for them. I'm a very loud listener, I've had a pair for around 2.5 years, and they still sound like when I bought them. The long chord is great for computer listening, but can be cumbersome with portable devices. One of the few problems I have with these phones is that they do feel tight after a long listening session, but after leaving them on a stack of books for a couple of days it's gotten much better. Overall, a very good product from my experiences."
3,Sony Monitor Headphones,"These are some of my favourite headphones, as they have great sound and are affordable, however, Sony must use terrible wiring/connections in their hardware, since most pairs I have owned short out after so many months of use. The pair I bought were used and already had a short in them, but I can't expect too much for a used product."
2,bad SQ but great for modding,I got these with the intent on placing a pair of Koss KSC75 drivers in them because my wife does not like clip-on headphones (KSC75's are clip-ons) I figured before I took the Sony drivers out I would give them a listen and I wish I never had! the sound is rather flat and boring to listen to. Bass and mids are terribly muddy and offer no dynamics at all. The trebel is harsh and slighly rolled off.In my opinion unless you want to use the headband for a project these are not worth what it cost to package them up.
4,Good headphones but...,"I owned this headphones and listened to music on them every day for about a year and a half (at work) and they are good. They do get uncomfortable after while, i've had to take em off at intervals to give my ears a rest cause they would start hurting.I will say that if you are looking for the best value for your money I would recomend the Sennheiser HD201 instead, i bought them about six months ago for 20 dollars here in Amazon and havent ceased to be amazed at the quality of the sound and how comfortable they are. My Sony MDRs have been stuck in my desk drawer since then, and i am not going back."
4,Good Product Good Price,It is a very good Product at a very Good Price. I didnt fint it tight as some other people said.
2,Beware - may cause tinnitus,"I bought these to listen to my new Sansa Clip and, yes, they sounded pretty decent, quite bassy and laid back but after listening to them for only a few minutes, I noticed my ears started ringing. These things are too tight and press the music into your ear canals and may be some of the worst headphones you can use when it comes to your precious hearing. I'm taking mine back tomorrow."
2,"Amazing sound, broke right after","It sounds really good but it's really uncomfortable and not durable at all. I tried to bend it gently so it would fit better, and due to a design flaw on the side the headphones were permanently damaged."
1,VOLUME WAY TOO LOW,Bought this for my netbook because sound is very low on it (as reported by reviews when I purchased it) and bought headphones as other netbook purchasers suggested. The volume WITH the headphones is LOWER than without them. Very disappointed.
1,"Good, but bad material","To start off, there was nothing wrong with these headphones in terms of sound quality, comfort, or price. To some, that's all that matters.What did irk me about these, was the fact that I only got 4 days of use out of them before the cups became detached from the headset, rendering them all but unusable without using liberal amount of glue, tape, and general fixing.I realize that for a cheap pair of headphones I shouldn't be expecting much, but can't I at least get a few months out of a product without it breaking almost entirely?Would not recommend to future customers on that basis. If you're ok with that, then go right ahead."
4,Good set for everyday use,"Pros: Great Sound, great price, solid construction, long cable, receiver adapterCons: Can get uncomfortable for people who wear glasses.Bought these after reading the reviews. Have been using them for a couple of months. The sound quality is really good. These do sit a little tight over the ears and can be uncomfortable if you wear glasses if worn for a long time. Beats every pair of earphones I ever owned. And since the construction is really solid I don't have to worry about pulling out any wires. Use them exclusively except when I go to the gym. Best value for the price."
4,Good buy,"The earphones are pretty comfortable and sound nice. I don't know if I'd use them for music, but I bought them as a gift for an aspiring filmographer and he seems to enjoy them just fine. He was using earbuds at first, so they're an obvious step up. Good price."
3,Break easily!,"I like the sound quility, but it is a tight fit & they break VERY easy. I have broke 2-3 sets & will buy the more expensive version next time. It is not a bad head phone.When I say break I mean the plastic ear pieces. It always breaks in the same spot too. The head phone keep working, but you have to put them yo to you ears. So it must be a manufacturing issue. They should re-engineer these. I really do like them & you can't beat the price though. I just wish they would last longer then a few weeks. They should not break so fast & in the same splace everytime. I used to use super glue, but now I need an upgrade & plan on buying the higher quality Sony ones. Can't wait! At least I have Prime & can have it shipped the next day for $3.99 or have it delivered for free using second day delivery."
1,These things sucked!,"In the past, I have always trusted Sony products. I've had these headphones less than a month and the left side has completely quit working! Since I trusted this brand, I got rid of the packaging, so now I have no way to return them. I guess I'm stuck with them. Next time I'll go straight to the store, that way if something goes wrong it will be a lot easier to return it."
1,HORRIBLE SOUND,"I picked these up to replace my old Sony headphones that I've been using for years because they're starting to fall apart. What a mistake. Beside the fact that they aren't very comfortable, the sound is atrocious. I listened to several different songs to see if maybe it was just the music and not the headphones but to my dismay every song was completely drowned out by bass. Loud, loud, bass. Every song listened to through these headphones is a ton of bass with a faint vocal in the background. Needless to say they are going back to the store and I'll just stick with my old Sonys until they completely stop working."
4,"Good comfortable headset, but little noise cancellation","I bought this product as an inexpensive headset to wear on airplanes. While it is certainly worth the price, it doesn't do much for airplane noise. It muffles and over-rides noise but limited noise cancellation if you are not playing music. But it was what I expected for the price and did help some. The fact that the product was comfortable was a plus. This is a fair choice if you can't afford the much costlier headphones."
1,bad choice,"They are heavy. The sound is lousy. They do not block out noise, infact they amplify office noise. The cheaper headset is a much better deal and a much better product. The cheaper set has much better sound quality."
2,Don't be clumsy,"My office has a really noisy A/V system. I sit half my days with these earphones on; they cut the sound significantly. Very comfortable. I also listen to news & music and the sound is good.However I caught the cable on my leg the other day, and ended up stepping on them. Cracked the arm and I'm not sure how much longer they will last."
2,Overpriced for what they are...,"To start off, these do sound pretty good. They are not very comfortable, just like every on the ear design. One of the earcups on mine fell off at the hinge, snd I cant get it to stay on anymore, so they are unusable now. I dissected and was a little disappointed to find out that they had the exact same speakers as the set of the cheap sets of headphones that came with walkmans way back in the 90's. The speaker is even set in the oblong shaped plastic piece that is used in the walkman headphones. They basically just put bigger earcups over the walkman headphones, making them more uncomfortable and raising the price.Instead, I would get a set that is big enough to go around the ears for comfort reasons. Something like the Sennheiser HD-202's"
1,We had two and they broke easily,"We have two of these headphones that I am in the process of throwing in the trash. They were only used a few times when a little plastic tab on the piece between the earpiece and the ""headband"" broke. Now the earpieces will not lay flat against your ear and they cannot be used. I expected better quality from Sony."
1,I screamed in terror,"Going through a drawer full of stuff I never use looking for a whetstone, I pulled these out. I'd put them in there a long time ago because I couldn't stand the fit. I couldn't really remember the sound, and having upgraded my equipment significantly since then decided to regress a bit and see what they were like again.Really bad. The fit was still terrible. They aren't ""over-ear"" at all. They sit on top of the ear and press on it. Glasses make the problems much worse. And they have no sound. No bass, plus those annoying overtones that always show up in cheap headphones and make them sound muddy.I quickly took them off and put my Sennheiser HD 600s back on to sooth my brain. One of the best headphones ever made, and now suprisingly affordable due to the release of the slightly upgraded 650s. Oh, and they're beyond comfortable as well. Huge earpads that don't even touch the ear."
1,sorry not even worth buying!!!!,these headphones looked good at the store since my old ones broke i needed new ones for my studio so i tryed buysing some cheaper replacements hoping to achieve some kind of happiness by paying less. but as it turns out these headphones weren't just bad they were bad&quot;ER&quot;They first were very i mean VERY!! unconfortable. the second right when i pluged them in they had a messed up sound pitch on them. I think if you are looking for more quality and duirability for these headphones you should just go somewhere else or try finding them herePS: they broke after they fell out of my window
2,"Cheap earphones, sound cheap and broke","i bought these earphones thinking they would have decent sound, well I was sadly mistaken, they sounded terrible and after about 3 weeks broke, the left ear kept fading in and out and then crackling.the sound is very fake and the noises you hear from the wires knocking anything is very deep and loud.also i found the padding was not all that comforatble, if i wore them for over an hour or so my ears hurt.i would rather pay an extra $10 or $15 and get a decend pair of senneheiser's or the like. the Sony sound was terrible."
4,They are so inexpensive,"If you want to marvel at the sound of your favorite record or be blown away by engineering wizardry - move on. These headphones don't even rate enough to appear on most audiophile ""best of"" critiques. But for something to leave at your desk, they're pretty incredible for the money. Average comfort. OK sound. OK build. OK isolation. All for the price of three Lattés."
2,Painful to wear after fifteen minutes,"I had gotten these as an exchange from a set of headphones that cost twice as much. And while the sound quality is better than those headphones, these will be going back to the store as well.I have a relatively small head, so it wasn't crushing my head like other people have described. But the headband is incredibly uncomfortable, even after adjusting several times in an attempt to alleviate the pressure on top of my head. The ear pieces were just as uncomfortable.Get these only if you want great sound... by holding them to one ear like they are designed to do."
2,OUCH!!!,"These headphones have awesome sound for the price you buy. Deep bass and clear treble.Here's the problem. They HURT!!! These are the most uncomfortable headphones I've ever had. Instead of the earcups going around your ear, they tend to lay right on the edge, making them uncomfortable. And not to mention, LEAK SOUND!These may sound excellent, but hurt badly. If I were you, I would shop around."
2,Better options available for not much more money,"I originally bought these headphones because I thought they might sound and feel better than my Sennheiser HDR-120s. The Sennheisers are more expensive but they are wireless so I thought I might get an advantage out of wired. I am no audophile, but I was hoping for an improvement.To my taste these are too tight, and the sound is not particularly good. Maybe I just prefer Sennheisers but of my headphones I rate them as follows:1. HD201 -- much better Sound **** Comfort **** Portability **2. HDR120 Sound *** Comfort *** Portability N/A Range ****2. PX100 Sound *** Comfort **** Portability ****3. MDR-V150 Sound ** Comfort ** Portability **My 12 year old thinks the Sony's are fine and they may be a good cheap headphone for kids.The HDR201's were recommended on many sites, and I thank those reviewers for their advice they are my favorite headphones so far."
2,Not worth it,"The only good thing I can say about these headphones is that they have a nice, clear bass. However, they have almost no treble and the mid-range is questionable. Sony should not be selling these as ""monitors."" They don't come even close. They also squeeze the user's head. My head is on the smaller side, however they give me a headache within a minute of putting them on."
3,Good while it lasted,I actually had no problem with this headset but after a couple of uses a piece of the headset broke off which caused the adjustment head band to not work properly. It might have been done to my destructive little sister (11yrs) but another important part of the headphones broke off causing both ear pieces to come off the head band and it took some interesting taping to make sure it would stay in place. Didn't even last me a year but I loved the long cord. Great while it lasted.
4,Great for the price.,If your looking for your average headphones these are this is the way to go. Overall a very good sound. Great for price! But if your looking for something REALLY nice. Eh not so much
2,Really Hurt the Ears,These have to be the most uncomfortable headphones I have ever owned. They pinch your ears so after a half hour or so you have to take them off. The sound is ok nothing special. I really tried but I just can't use this style of headphone. Might be good for a business who needs cheap headphones on short applications but other than that I can't see who else could really use these. The price is good but in all honesty they are far too uncomfortable to be practical. I'm gonna try out some seinheisser 555's even though they cost a little more I think comfort and sound are worth it.
3,Good Price but lacking in comfort,"This product is really tight and there is no way to adjust the level of tightness. You can only adjust its length but it does not helps in comfort level. I bought it after reading the reviews and low price, but the item is now sitting idle in my closet. The headphone compresses your temple and ear area if you put it on for more than half an hour. And my head is of average size. My gf has the same issue with this product."
2,Broke within a week,"The headphones were nice. The cord was longer than I needed, but not too bad. The sound in one of the headphones broke in a week. Amazon doesn't accept returns without the original packaging, which I didn't have. It shipped in one of those plastic containers that you have to use scissors to open. I contacted Sony which is what you have to do when their product has a defect like this. It cost an additional $6.00 to mail them the item to be repaired or replaced. The quality was nice and they were enjoyable to use. My problem is with the support that Sony gives you after it's broke."
1,Broke in a month,"I was given these as a present. They had a full sound. Initially they were comfortable but after an hour they hurt, especially with glasses. After a month the plug broke off in the socket of me electric piano! Pretty cheap construction."
3,Good for its price,"I was looking for a cheap replacement for my busted Sennheiser PX100 and found this in Amazon. The price ($13 when I bought it) and the Sony brand attracted me, so I grabbed one. I have to say it cannot match PX100's clarity.However for its price, it's a good desktop headphones. Some might complain it's too tight and I do get my ears all sweaty after half and hour or so. But again, you got what you paid for."
3,Sony MDR-V150 Headphones review,"It is excellent in sound quality and an efficient tool for video and sound editing. However, after a long time of use, the earcups irritate the earlobes because of the pressure. It is not very comfortable when it is used for a long period."
2,"Poor sound, too tight","I bought these to replace an inexpensive pair of Sony MDR-026. I found them to be too tight (and I have a small head), and the sound not as good. Would not recommend these headphones. I returned mine."
4,Sony MDR-V150 Headphones,"For the money these work just as well as claimed by Sony. I especially liked the ability to let another person listen to one headphone which is great if you are using them on an Iphone or Ipod. Pretty good, though not exceptional, sound."
2,"Too tight, muddy sound","I bought these headphones as a replacement for a pair of Sony MDR-XD100s that broke. I found them to be an uncomfortably tight fit on my thoroughly average-sized cranium. Worse, the sound is quite muddy and indistinct. These headphones aren't unusable, but I wish I'd just coughed up the extra $5 for the MDR-XD200s."
2,NOT ONE OF SONY'S BETTER PRODUCTS,"With Sony you usually get no more than what you pay for. These headphones don't cost much and they aren't worth much, either. Overall flimsy plastic construction, not sensitive (loud) enough, so-so frequency response. I paid about the same price for a set of JVC headphones that are much better in every way."
4,Look No Further!,I received these headphones last night and I am impressed. Great sound. I would recommend these to any one who is trying to buy headphones on a budget and who is still looking for quality! You will not be disappointed!
4,head phones,the phones are fine for the moneyjust wish the cord was a bit longerI have some dammaged hearing so buying high priced head phones would be a waste of money these work excellent
4,definitely...not bad,"I got these to use with my electronic drum kit, desiring something a little more substantial than some throwaway lightweight cans, and certainly something better than the dreadful Labtec phones I ignorantly used for years. These headphones are cheap, yes, but beside being quite adequate for a drum synthesizer, are actually pretty nice music phones for so cheap. Bass is heavy, therefore you will not dig them a whole lot for classical music, especially if you are accustomed to Grado and the like, but they do the trick. It seems to be getting more and more difficult to get really crappy headphones nowadays."
2,Ouch! These things are uncomfortable,"These headphones really sound great, I only wish I could keep them on my head for longer than 10 or 15 minutes...These things squeeze your head and ears like a vise. Be careful."
1,Tighter than a Gnats......,"These things will squeeze your brains out of your eyeballs - listen to other people - I didn't.Sound quality is woolly, not crystal.That said I bought some Sennheiser PX100's infinitely better sound and now my head does not feel like it is in a torturers vice.Could have save myself the $15 and some pain - although if you are thinking about surgery for ears that stick out - this is a cheap alternative."
1,Sony Headphones,"The headphones were very poorly made and broke within one use. A small plastic tab holds the earcups in place, which broke. We returned both sets for a full refund."
2,"Not bad, but there are far better options, even at $20","This is a decent pair of headphones, but are not nearly as good as some people think. In terms of sound quality, for me, they are unbearable. They have terrible reproduction of just about every frequency, as well as having that terrible closed in soundstage common to cheap closed headphones. Comfort is just as terrible. I defy you to wear these with glasses and not get a headache every single time. Overall, they are not worth the money or even the time it takes to ship them to your house. They sell simply because the brand Sony is well known for being associated with quality products. Quite frankly, if I owned Sony, I would be embarrassed to have my company's name on this product. Do yourself a favor and buy a pair of Sennheiser HD 201s instead. Those are not particularly jaw dropping either, but can be found at lower prices than these and have far better sound quality and comfort."
2,Drowning in a sea of bass,"I've only played around with cheaper headphones, the highest end thing I've ever tried being my pair of Koss PortaPros, but even I can tell that the Sony MDR-V150 is a POS. From the lowest of lows to the highest of highs, everything manages to sound indistinct and vaguely bassy.That would be fine and all, but there are many many headphones in lower and higher price ranges that sound better. Even my cheap-o $3 JVC Marshmallows are far clearer than these."
3,good sound,why did the price go up so much in 2012sound is good but for commercial purposes they break a lot
4,Great for the price,"Hey I am using this with my mini disk player and they work great. The cord is very durable, but quite long. Good for computer users but bad for personal music. You can take part of of and zip tie it up or tape it. No big deal. They feel quite sturdy even though they are completely plastic. All in all I am quite happy, For the price they can't be beat."
1,1980'S FLASHBACK....NOOOOOOO,"All I can honestly say about these ""TIN"" cans is that they have a built in ""Space-Time Wormhole Portal"" !!!!!All my beautiful pristine audio tracks played through these Vice-Clamps were instantly transported back through time to the year of our Lord ""Nineteen Hunderd and Eighy-One and their ""Ultra-Modern"" recording equipment and techniques... ""HIGHLY Oxidized Magnetic Reel to Reel Tape--Obviously containing residual cocaine and marijuana resins and quite possibly(by the sound)Bong water as well""!!!!!! Only after finally using my dad's ""Collector's Edition"" Elvis Presley Shoe-Horn/Back-Scratcher was I able to forcibly pry these puppies Offa' Me Noggin' and get a couple of Extra Strength Tylenol down my neck to alleviate some of the pain... Now I have a Semi-permanant FLOCK OF SEAGULLS Hairdoo that will require extensive Hot Oil treatments to straighten out..... THANKS ALOT SONY!!!! By the way.....yer' headphones SUCK!!!!"
2,Plug snapped off,"Purchased in January 2011. Plug snapped off wire in Nov 2012. Could have been mishandled by my kids. Could be poorly built in that the 1/4"" phone plug gives enough leverage to easily snap off the miniplug. Worked well while it lasted."
1,Like putting your head in a vise,"It does not matter what these headphones sound like; using them is too painful. The cups are mashed against your ears so tightly that you won't be able to enjoy whatever sound is coming out of the speakers.After 5 minutes your ears will feel hot, after 7 minutes they will start to throb, after 10 minutes you'll start to get a nasty headache, after 12 minutes you'll struggle with the head band trying to find some way to adjust this torture device, after 15 minutes you'll realize you've wasted your money and you'll want to write a bad review.From now on I'm never buying any thing I can't try on first."
2,They're okay for the price.,"I purchased a new pair from best buy and I rarely used them. I find out that the plastic covering on the ear padding is peeling off into my ear. So my face is covered in black pieces of plastic. I had hardly even used them. On that point, it makes them unusable unless you're going to shower right after or risk walking around with black pieces of plastic all over your face. Right now I'm trying to pick off all the outer coating so I can finally use them."
2,"Bassy, boomy, indistinct","I guess you get what you pay for but these are terribly bassy and boomy. Indistinct across the whole frequency range. I thought it was the source material but I tried everything I could find to listen to, but it was the same. I would recommend these to sea creatures who are used to hearing sound underwater or if you want to best replicate the sound of owning an apartment with a neighbor who listens to loud music. For those sounds, these are great. For listenable music, not so much."
2,Muddy Waters,"I couldn't be more disappointed with these headphones... Plenty of bass and good volume (sensitivity) but NO clarity. Where's the treble and mid-range? Can barely understand lyrics. Maybe I got a bad set, but man-oh-man are these muddy sounding. The free headphones I got with 2 different discman players sound better. I guess I'll have to relegate these to use while mowing my lawn..."
4,"Sound better than Bose TriPort, but...","Sound better than Bose TriPort (that has overemphasized bass). Sound better than my best Koss. Unfortunately: a) too tight. After half an hour I have just enough, b) the cord seems to be rated for 60 amperes, extremelly thick and stiff"
5,Literally the best you can buy for less than 70 dollars,"If you're expecting to find a comparable pair of headphones for [...] bucks, think again. I've owned these for 5 years now. They've been on 3 nationwide tours, to two different colleges and back, and everywhere in between, and they're still in amazing condition. The sound quality is absolutely stunning for their price. Comparable to 80 dollar headphones. Get three pairs of these. Seriously. You will not be sorry. The cable quality is also very nice. Thick rubber, very good construction."
5,Best affordable headphones out there,"Got mine during Thanksgiving Sale for $9! Definitely worth my money. After months of constant use and harsh handling (I often drop them), it still works as great as the first time I bought them."
4,Very Happy,"Great sound quality. Could be a bit more comfortable, but for the money I am very satified."
2,too tight,"partially my own fault though, should have anticipated that such an earphone would be tight."
1,poor design,"Price - OKManufacturing - BAD.I only used these a few times and one of the small plastic tab that prevents the ear cup to pivot broke.With the broken tab, this allows the ear cup to rotate full swing which makes the headphones very unusable."
3,Sony MDR-V150 review,I bought these to use with iPad and PC mostly.I own sennheiser HD280 Pro and sennheiser px-100 and I must say these headphones are not in the same level at all.Yes they do the job but the sound is kind of faded and flat (so far).I'm not an expert and the main thing I really wanted to say is that these headphones are extremely uncomfortable.So much so it actually pains. My head is quite narrow so I just can't really think why my ears sore after 10 minutes of use. I had to fly for 10 hours and was hoping to enjoy some music.. that was hard.One other thing is that the cord does not come out of the headphones from one side which is less comfortable if you are using it for monitoring etc.I'm disappointed. While writing this review I'm using my HD280.. what a difference in comfort and sound.
4,Built like a Tank.,"I like many other's have had the Sony MDR-V150 Headphones for year's, at least 4 or 5 for me. I have put them through some tough use and never had a problem with the build quality. They actually still look new, no scratches excellent wire's etc. I must say that if you really want a better pair for your money look at the newer SONY MDR-ZX300. They sound WAY better then the MDR-V150 headphone's. MY old MDR-V150'S have served me well and still look and sound very good. I have always found that the Sony MDR-V150's volume level to be kind of low in my opinion. Also know that the cord on the Sony MDR-V150 headphones is much longer than the cord on the Sony MDR-ZX300 headphones and may not be a good choice for portable sound monitoring."
3,Terribly tight on the ears!,"I bought these headphones a few years ago at a mass retailer for $25. The construction is durable and the materials last a long time, but the big problem I have with them is that the earpieces are round--not oval. No one has round ears and the earpieces are unbelievably tight and they pinch. I was constantly taking them off because of outer ear pain. The sound quality is excellent, however--very clear and deep. However, I would not buy these again. I have replaced them with Sennheiser headphones with oval earpieces and they have excellent sound quality, too."
1,Cheap Plastic Fair sound save up spend about $100,I got these as a X'mas gift to replace a failed set of Apple ear buds I'd tell you a lot about the quality of the sound but as of the second week I owned them the cheap plastic supporting the can on the left side failed so the ear piece now will not stay where it belongs. If I constantly hold it ( Like the announcer Gary Owens from Laugh in days ) then it worksI was suckered in by the cost but you truly get what you pay for. read Ken Rockwell's blog on headphones then spend about $100. I'll leave it at thatlater
1,Great until they broke,"I was very pleased with these headphones initially - they are comfortable and have great sound for the price. However, after less than a year of ownership and light use, the right earcup broke. The part that prevents it from bending out to the side no longer works, so the headphones won't sit on my head properly. The right one wants to turn so that it is horizontal rather than up against my head. I haven't found an easy way to fix them. Unfortunately, I am now shopping for headphones again."
2,Easily broken,"I received Sony MDR-V150 headphones as a gift, and the sound quality is fantastic. So why don't I like them? Because they're designed to be useless & unrepairable when a small plastic tab is broken off. I did not abuse them, and must have applied a little too much pressure in a certain way so as to break the tiny plastic tab. The next time I went to use them, the left earpiece would not stay in place, rendering them useless. I'm so very disappointed that SONY would design something so easily broken, and unrepairable."
2,Highly uncomfortable on ears !,"Pros :Sound quality is good.Cheaper to buy.Cons :Highly uncomfortable on ears. After using it for 3 continuous days, my ears started aching.!"
4,My third set - Three users and I am still loving it.,This is my third set of the same brand/model. I wear them for 16+ hours a day and have no issue with sound or confort. I gave two sets to my Son and wife and both liked it as well.
4,Alright Headphones,I Had Them For 2 Weeks And The Head Phone Plug In Broke Off.. The Sound Was A Lil Crackly.
2,To hot on the ears!!!!!!,"I'm always trying new headphones, I've owned everything from Coby,Grado to Dr Dre's. Well this is another pair to throw in my headphone drawer. They sound like twenty five dollar headphone! better than some not as good as others. The thing that sets them apart from others in the price range is after you wear them for a short period of time, twenty five minutes or so your ears get unbearably hot,which is annoying and uncomfortable. I gave them a shot and now they are exiled to my file drawer with the other disappointments like the Sennheiser HD 20's and the Skullcandy lowrider camo. (Skullcandy in ear headphones are great sounding). Invest your money in something else other than these sauna cans."
2,I won't use them anymore,"I get headache after using these headphones for more than half an hour so I won't use them anymore.Sound quality is good. They are just uncomfortable for my ears and head. If the width of your head is wide, you may get the same problem I got."
2,"Sound is nice, painful to wear","I find the sound quality on these headphones to be nice, but they are very uncomfortable to wear. The first 3 days I used them I got a terrible headache and jaw pain from the pressure, which eventually went away. During the second week of use, I noticed the pinna of my ears to be very tender and wearing the headphones is very painful. If I could do it over again, I would not buy theses headphones and save myself the trouble."
2,Too Tight and not the best sound,"I found the Sony MDR-V150 Headphones to be too tight for my head, and I believe many other reviewers share the same view as me. After 15-20 minutes of use, I had to remove them because of the growing pressure against my ears. I ended up with a splitting headache after I used these headphones. And what's more, the sound quality isn't that great either.And I'm not comparing these with in-ear iPod headphones. I'm comparing the Sony ones with on-ear headphones of other make. For example, I previously owned one made by Panasonic, and the sound quality was superb and it was very comfortable to have over your ears. Even the Bose on-ear regular headphones are comfortable and provide good quality sound, although those are a lot more expensive."
3,Simply OK...,"I've had these cheap SONY cans for about three years now and the earpiece has finally worn off. Hence I was in the market for a new pair of everyday cans.The SONY studio monitors were my go-to headphones for general use (watching movies/listening to music on my laptop).Then I came across a pair of Sennheiser HD 202's on sale (Musician's Friend, 19.99!) and said why not. Sennheiser has an amazing rep and I've always wanted a pair.MY GOD are the Sennheiser HD 202's better than the SONY. First off they completely surround my ears, where the SONY's cups are so small that they just basically sit on top of my ears, and would actually become PAINFUL after about an hour. And the sound quality and Bass of the Sennheiser HD 202's I feel are superior.The Sennheiser HD 202's are WAY more comfortable. Get them, you will not be disappointed!"
3,okay for some but spend more for low end studio versions,"I bought these about 2 years ago for my work computer. They work fine for that but my opinion is that the bass overwhelms the rest of the sound range. Some would like that, I don't. I actually prefer a cheap Phillips headset from target (about $8-9) because they sound more natural. Since these are big and bulky, you'd be better off spending a lot more to get better quality (like $60-70). The MDR-v150 leaves me non-plused, just nothing exciting about them other than they cover your ears. The better models are Sony MDR-v6, Grado s-60i, etc."
4,Good Headphones,"I like these headphones, they are a big improvement over the one's that I had been using to listen to audio from computer, which were the little cheap one's that come with portable CD players. They are quite effective at blocking background noise, also. I also find them to be quite comfortable on my big head, so all in all I give them four stars, because they are an excellent value, but the sound quality just isn't up to par with the higher end models."
2,Disappointing headphones,"I bought these headphones mainly for use on my computer. The sound quality is decent, but sounds like there is a slight echo. My Sony ""MDR-G57G S2 Sports Street Style' headphones produce a much clearer sound than the MDR-V150. These headphones are also very uncomfortable. They feel cheaply made and are made for smaller heads. The cords are in an awkward position on the bottom of the cups, so that if you use them at a computer the wires get in the way.The price on these headphones is low for a reason - you get what you pay for."
3,Like wearing a padded vise on my head...,"Well, I've had them on for less than 15 minutes, and I fully agree with digikat that these headphones are way too tight. I don't have an overly large head or anything, but they are quite uncomfortable...especially with earrings on. I actually like the long cord, since I use them at my computer and don't like to be closely tethered to my speakers. The sound quality and bass response is pretty decent as well, given the price.Unfortunately, I'll be returning these, since I really need headphones that don't make my ears and head hurt after wearing them for an extended period of time...should've checked the Amazon reviews before buying these locally."
4,"A little snug, but nice sound","I normally buy really cheap headphones, so these are definitely a step up for me. The cord is longer than I'm used to and they come with an adapter for larger jacks. The headphones' earcups should be comfortable, but they are just a little bit too snug for that. However, they are still better than the really cheapo headphones I used to buy. The sound certainly is much better and I don't have to run the volume very high at all to hear the nuances of the music properly. Since I use these at work, it's important that I can hear my boss' voice when he needs to speak to me, so that feature is great."
4,decent headphones for the price,"These are easily adjustable and the reversible earcups work fine. For the money, they aren't a bad set of headphones. They fit a little tight, so take care if that bugs you."
4,Great Set of headphones but...,Great Set of headphones but... the chord is too long.. This wouldn't be a problem if I was using them in a car or maybe a dj booth...I use them for my mp3 player when walking to class or jogging.The sound quality is great and the price i paid for them was even better.
3,lasted two years and went to garbage,"they lasted two years exactly, I was overall satified with the quality of sound, but today I noticed the sound was 90% down from what it usually is and even though my computer sound volume setting was 100% I could barely hear anything.. anyway, I pulled the jack hoping to fix the sound and after a few jerking moves it came off completely.. and there went my earphones.. straight to the garbage. Ohh well.."
1,Short Life Span,"After about 4 months of use (8 hours per week), the right sound channel failed to work.Prior to the failure, I did enjoy the sound quality.Expected the headphones to last longer tha 4 month."
2,These guys hurt!,"Felt like I wasted cash after I took a chance against the other reviews saying these hurt. I figured I have a small head and perhaps I'd be okay. Unfortunately, I thought wrong."
5,Great headphones for the money,"I've had a pair of these headphones for several years and would definitely recommend them for anyone who wants some good-sounding headphones for a low price. The headphones provide a pretty full sound, and the padding around the ears helps keep out noise from the outside. Also the cord is quite long, so you can go a few feet from your music without yanking the headphones off of your head.My one small complaint is that they start to become a bit uncomfortable after a couple hours of use. This could have to do with how snugly they fit around my head. Repositioning them slightly when I notice discomfort usually takes care of the problem for a little while longer."
2,Good... But Bad,"While the sound quality is quite good for the price, the lack of comfort is a huge drawback. After about 25 minutes of wearing these headphones the pressure against one's ears becomes unbearable. These headphones are terrible for long flights, but great for a short 30 minute music jam session. There are definitely better head phones out there."
5,great sony headphones,these are great headphones. super price and I got them right away as promised. i am very happy with the headphones
2,Too tight!,"These are just too damn tight for comfortable use over any length of time. Perhaps they were intended for people with very small heads. The tightness is not adjustable though they can be lengthened to the point where they don't fit. Bargain priced, but no bargain!"
3,"Great sound, HORRIBLE comfort.","Yes, these sound great, but there's no point at all of having them if you can't wear them for more than 10 minutes. They're really uncomfortable and very tight.Wouldn't recommend them."
2,Drastic change from old MDR-V150s,"I bought these to replace my old, warn-out MDR-V150s that I have had for years (5+). I guess I shouldn't be surprised, but the quality difference in sound and build is shocking. The old V150s were rich in bass and built like tanks. The new ones are very hard and plastic-like. They were also really tight on the head/ears (not in a good way). These are getting sent back. I guess I'm back on the hunt for a good pair of headphones. For the price, I suppose they are not terrible, but I'm comparing it with its old self."
2,Uncomfortably tight,"While the sound quality is fine and the cord a decent length, the earpieces press tightly against the ears. After 10-15 minutes with these, my ears protest, and as it pains me to pain them, I reluctantly remove the headphones. I have asked around and received multiple assurances that my head is reasonably normal, therefore I believe the trouble lies with the headphones, not with my physiognomy."
4,Can't beat them for this price!,"I have owned several headphones and I'm VERY critical of sound quality. While I've never been a fan of Sony Headphones, I absolutely recommend getting these (I paid nearly [...] bucks at my electronics store, but you can find them cheaper). These phones have a wider-than-usual sound range resulting in lower bass than your average phones and also higher highs.I still feel like there there's something missing sound-wise and they do sound a bit ""hollow"" - that's the only reason I give them a 4-out-of-5 rating."
3,not very comfortable,"This model's headband has no cushion, and the earpiece foam is too thin and not dense enough to cut out much external noise. Therefore it is not very comfortable after 30 minutes, and not good for noisy environments.Sound quality is good, however."
3,"Good Sound, Painful on the Ears","These have a great sound for the price. I love them! However after about 20-30 minutes my ears are throbbing from the pressure. Also, it puts a small amount of pressure on the top of my head, and that starts to hurt after a while also. I think I'm building up an immunity to it :) But it's not FUN!"
4,Sony MDR-V150 Headphones,"I was surprised by the sound quality of these headphones. I am using them with my Creative Labs Zen MP3 player. The Sony headphones deliver surprisingly good sound quality for a relative low cost. As an extra bonus, these headphones help block out distracting background sounds. Although these headphones don't come up to my Sony MDR-CD50 Digital headphones, they only cost a fraction of what the digital headphones cost.Also, the MDR-V150 comes with a dual plug-in arrangement making them adaptable to other electronic devices. Overall, if you are in the market for a quality pair of headphones at a ""reasonable"" price, consider the Sony MDR-V150 as a wise choice."
5,works very well,nice sound i use it for my zune mp3 player i get the sound i want and i got it for the best price i could find on line
2,"Crappy build, okay sound.","I bought 4 sets of these as a cheap way for musicians to monitor themselves while recording in my home studio. The sound isn't great, but good for the price. They are built TERRIBLY - very fragile and uncomfortable! All of them were broken in about a month. They have small plastic pieces to hold the cups in place which snap under normal wear-and-tear. I tried to fix them, but couldn't get them to fit right for more than an hour. Now I have to buy a new group of headphones - and it's not going to be these."
2,"Decent sound, very uncomfortable fit","I always wanted to like these headphones, but they just hurt my head and ears too much. I have a pair of Koss Porta Pros that I love, but they don't seal out any outside noise. I am still searching for a pair of over-the-ear phones that are comfortable and don't cost and arm and a leg (like the Bose TriPort, the most comfortable headphone I have ever seen)."
4,"Years of great use, getting another pair","After 5 years of constant use, one of the ears is finally cutting out. It's funny when you use a product for years and never think much about it...but now that buying another pair, I can 100% vouch for these headphones. For an average user, it will be the best $20 headphones money can buy."
4,Satisfied,"These are really good studio headphones, wondeful sound. I am a bit rough and tough on my headphones, so I've sustained a bit of damage due to lazily throwing them into my backpack. But even with a nick, the sound is still great. Timely delivery, very satisifed."
2,Boomy Bass,"I was so excited to get this Sony headphones at only [...] with free shipping. It looked well made considering the cost and comfortable on my ears. But when it comes to the sound quality, I can not say I agree with the most other reviews here. I'm wondering how the others can leave such good reviews. The most unfavorable thing isit has egaggerated bass. So boomy that you can not here the exact sound of the original recording. I tried to give some break in times but after 3 days of trying, I gave up and returning this poor headphones back to Amazon. Thank you Amazon for your easy way of returning."
2,Ouch!,"These are really tight!Delivers good bass, but sound is lacking on the high end.Construction is up to Sony's usual high standards."
3,"Good buy for the money, but...","Yeah these are dirt cheap for studio style headphones, but wow do they hurt your ears. The constant pressure starts to take its toll after wearing them for about an hour. I bought these to have a second set of headphones for monitoring sounds while I edit videos in my apartment at school, but you are better off purchasing the Plantronics game com headphones with the hidden mic atachment. I have worn the gamecom headsets for 6+ hours straight and barely have any discomfort. I don't usually leave negative reviews but I have no tucked these headphones in my desk drawer in case of an emergency and I need a set of headphones right away. (Hey at least they came with a 1/4 inch adapter lol)"
4,For once I don't regret buying headphones!,"I just got them today and just tried them on. I am quite satisfied with these compared to the Skullcandy Low Riders. Although, these are a bit tight on the head. I have a pretty small head and I'm a girl so it actually kinda hurts my ears, but only because I have studs, but they are a bit tight. I'm hoping that it will loosen a little once I break them in. These are light weight so convenient to carry around. If you're an audiophile, you should know better not to get these. If you just listen to music, watch movies/shows online, play games, etc. then these are worth getting. I'll only use these to listen to music so they're pretty good for the price. I got these when it was $12 something a few days ago so well worth it for me."
3,Good but not the best,"They're good headphones... but not the best sound (especially highs).After a long period of time, the earcups fit unconfortable."
1,Not good enough for the price,"I bought these after hearing from a few people that they made decent low-end headphones. I replaced them after two months and am never going back. They really are glorified Walkman headphones, and compared to the Koss KSC-75's with which I replaced them, they sound awfully muddy and unrefined. Portability was poor too, and my head would start to feel clamped after only an hour or two of listening. All around, the KSC-75's are a much better value."
1,Not a suitable replacement,"I bought these headphones, Sony MDR-V150s, hoping they might be decent enough to replace my 10+ year old Sony MDR-V100 headphones, or at least work as a secondary set until I found the right higher-quality headphones for daily use. Unfortunately, the audio quality was awful. Right out of the box, they sounded incredibly muddy/muffled/dull compared to my well-worn V100s. I went back and forth for a few minutes, between the new headphones and my old ones - the audio source wasn't the problem. Plus the cord was a bit thin/flimsy and too short for me, and the ear pieces felt like they didn't have enough padding.I'm not an audiophile, and I wasn't expecting a lot from headphones at this price, but I just couldn't use these. They were back in the box after about 15 minutes of use and returned to the big box store a few days later."
2,Viselike,"I purchased these about a year ago, and yes they sound really great. Although there is one major drawback. I believe that an ""Asian"" developed them, because they are the most ""uncomfortable"" headphones I've ever used in my life. An asian with a considerably smaller head, because these feel like a VISE around your ears. Did I mention that they will give you one heck of a ""headache"" too? I'm trying to warn anyone to not purchase these since there are many more alternatives out there. And I by no means have an oversized head! Check out my ""other"" reviews, since I feel like I'm a very fair man. I just don't want anyone else to make a poor purchase one these!"
1,Cheap plastic bracket,"The cheap plastic side bracket breaks easily and Sony doesn't provide a replacement, rendering these useless. You'd think, given a quick Google search shows this is a common problem, that Sony would sell a cheap replacement for this flawed design issue. Nope. Last pair of headphones I buy from them. Sennheiser from now on."
1,VERY POOR QUALITY...,"These headphones are only $16, but for that price you should be able to get a pretty decent set. Our set lasted for about 6 uses and then stopped working (this is almost always due to crappy wiring and it shorts out). Amazon is refunding my purchase price, even though it's been more than 30 days since the purchase. Spend a few dollars more and get some better quality headphones! D. Olsen, North Carolina"
1,Poor quality product,The headphones are poor quality. They cut in and out on the right side and just generally sound poor. Too cheap to return I guess you get what you pay for!!
3,"Great sound, tight on the head",First couple of months were the hardest - these headphones are really tight on the head. At times I had headaches from the pressure.Otherwise the sound is really good.
2,"Decent sound quality, terrible craftsmanship","The headphones offer decent sound quality for the price. Not great; if you intend to listen to CDs of classical music then these are definitely not for you. Fine for mp3 quality recordings.Unfortunately, the headphones are very uncomfortable due to their inflexibility. I put up with it for a few months, never being able to wear them for more than a half hour or so before I had to give my head a break from the compression. At that point the piece that stabilizes one of the earcups broke from normal handling, and now they are essentially worthless. The earpiece won't stay flat against my head anymore.Sony offers no electronic support and their only phone support is not toll-free, inexcusable for such a huge company. Not going to waste my money on Sony's junk headphones ever again."
3,Good for the Price,surprisingly they r very good and even better cause there cheap and comes with extra headphone tipgood qualityleaks a little to muchvery very long cordconfortablestylishtight fit wont fall offdependablelast very longdurableif loud enough can tune out most things including nagging parents while ur doin ur hwjust very nice overallshould get them if ur lookin for good dj sound quality for really cheap
4,works well,"delivered early, phones work well in recordings, also in stadium type settings. can here rich and good bass sounds from other musicians, only thing is after having on a long time, approx. half hour or more, gets a little uncomfortable and hurt my ears. otherwise i would recommend."
4,Great for the price.,"Can't ask for much more. $15, nice thick cord, comes w/ the 1/4"" stereo jack, did I mention $15 IIRC these are PRIME eligible. I live in Dallas so I had them the next day before work. The SQ is better than my Bose NC headphones, although the bose of course do a much better sound of canceling noise."
2,headphone tabs break easily,"While I had no problem with the sound quality, I was only able to enjoy these headphones for a short bit.The headphones were too tight from the start and quickly made my ears hurts. It's even worse if you wear glasses as it causes your earpieces to dig into your skin from the pressure.After a few short weeks of use the one of the tabs that hold the actually ear pieces in place broke. These tabs that hold the ear pieces from moving are very small and it's amazing they even last more than a few days."
4,Not much to complain about,Received these about a month ago and I have found them to be a very nice pair of headphones.Advantages- Overall nice sound- Very responsive bass (and luckily not overdone like other Sony models)- Long cord is great- Connector adapter was a great plusDisadvantages- fit is a bit tight (I don't find it to be as serious an issue as others)- The only thing missing is an inline volume controlLooks like I've found a headphone model that I can stick with for some time.
3,Good build quality / Poor sound quality,"PROS -- Cheap- Great build quality and studio monitor capabilityCONS -- The sound is awfulBut for $20, you can't ask for much more. I'd pony up another $15 and get the AKG K26P portables."
1,These are awful!,"Had two pairs before, and stupidly bought yet another pair when the previous ones finally broke for good on me. The first pair broke constantly, even after repeated attempts at supergluing them back together(they broke along the small plastic pieces holding the headphones onto the band), and I was wearing the second pair when I accidentally got up and knelt on the cord, so that the headphone jack ripped out of the cord completely and nearly got stuck in my iPod(yes, I realise that one was my fault).This pair is my last one from Sony, I've only had them since March, and already they're breaking down so that unless I position the cord exactly right, the sound cuts in and out(sometimes I can hear the music, but no vocals, and sometimes vice versa), and on occasion it cuts out entirely. Just not worth it for the price I paid for them, I'll be looking for a different pair after this."
4,For the price is a great product,"The earcups could be larger and with better shield but then, that exactly what the more expensive ones have. I do not see any problems with performance. You need to understand that you may blow your years off with these headphones but it will require something more powerfull than an iPod. What you get here instead is more fidelity, even with a mp3 player"
3,"Good for the money, but uncomfortable for any extended listening","I own a recording studio, and generally use SONY MDR-7506 headphones. I decided to give these a try, but ultimately returned them. By comparison, these are tight fitting - they hurt my head. And the bass response is over-hyped, which makes the sonic balance out of whack."
4,Excellent for the price,"These are being used for our Mobile DJ company, they work great for the price>"
3,"Sound Great,but break easily","I love the way theses sounded, however the same C clip that connects the cups, to the actually head set broke. On both sides.If this could be fixed, these would be 5 star headphones."
2,Lasted a year,"These headphones sound great for the price. The only issue (which is a big one) is that after a year of use the left side speaker wire got all twitchy, so half the time nothing is coming out of the left hand speaker. It's a bummer."
4,ill never understand why people pay so much for headphones.,"for $15 this is nuts. they dont block out sound, and the cable is a little too long, but these are just great headphones, had em for a long time, havent given me 1 bit of trouble."
5,superior sound,"I got used to the high quality of these headphones, and when I unthinkingly stuffed them in my satchel and they snapped in two, I had to get a replacement pair. I use them every day, great product."
3,"sound is great, but they don't hold up well","I bought these headphones on Amazon about 11 months ago, and use them a few times a week. I paid more than normal, as I was tired of the cheaper headphones breaking from use. Well, 11 months later these are breaking, right where they extend on the one side. Not too happy about it, as I paid more hoping they would hold up better. I already ordered new headphones to replace them and went cheaper. If they are only going to last close to a year before they break, I may as well not invest much money in them for what I use them for. I have been happy with the sound quality, but not happy with how they hold up under not that frequent of use."
5,Great Headphones,"For the longest time I was using earbuds, which work well. However, I am not a huge fan of the earbuds and I happened to find a pair of these Sony MDR-V150's in my closet. I tried them out and I really loved the sound. I'm not a headphone expert or anything, but I'd say the sound on these headphones is very clear. I also liked how comfortable they are. Because I wear glasses, most traditional style headphones are irritating because they are tight and uncomfortable. These headphones aren't too tight and they fit pretty well. With other headphones Ive noticed the foam on the ear pieces isn't very comfortable, which is just another reason why I love these headphones. Unfortunately my roommate borrowed them and broke them. So I bought the same pair and they came relatively quick for ordering them around the holidays. I took them out of their brand new packaging and tried them out and they worked great. For around $20 you can't beat this deal."
2,Easily breakable,"My primary complaint with this product is that it is easily breakable and not designed for the wear-and-tear that comes with heavy use or light traveling. I knew at the outset that the plastic portions would be more fragile, so I took care in how I packaged them when taking them anywhere. They still broke in about 6 weeks--perhaps I shouldn't have expected much based on the price. Seriously, don't expect portability. So, if you're not planning on putting them in a bag or taking them anywhere, and only plan to use them at a desk, they're fine for the money. But unless you want to have to replace them every 2 months, consider spending more to get a more durable pair."
4,"Quite good for the price, but...","There are decent headphones for the price but their weakness is the mini plug. I lost one side after bumping the plug. Being a decent electronic technician and having some parts on hand, I replaced the mini plug with a full size stereo plug (1/4"" Switchcraft -- I was using these for a small recording console). Afterward I dissected the mini plug and could easily see how tenuous the internal connections are. The quality of the cable itself is quite good.Also, if you are going to wear them for hours on end, you might consider moving up to a model that has circumaural (around-ear rather than on-ear) design. These can feel tight after a while.So if one side stops working, it's the plug. Just treat it gently, maybe use some kind of strain relief on the cable so it does tug inside the plug."
5,"For $15, you can't go wrong.","Sure, they are not $100 noise-cancelling headphones. But for $15, they are easily the best stereo headphones I have ever used. The sound quality is astounding, very loud bass. They are also extremely comfortable, I had them on for over an hour, and the cartilage in my ears were pain free. Highly recommended!"
2,Ouch!,These Sony headphones have very good sound but are a pain on the ears. As others have stated after 20 minutes or so one wants to visit a clinic for the pain. Look elsewhere for better comfort.
5,Best product I ever used... simple and effective,"Best product I ever used... simple and effective...I am using this more than 2 years... no breaks or cracks... whoever comes to see me at my office, they like it and buy it... so nice and comfortable.cable is very hard, which is good sometimes as you connect somewhere down and accessing, it won't break the connection...anyway, I really love it... in every part of it."
3,Good if not broken,"I bought these less than a year ago, and they've worked well for a while. The sound was pretty good, and I didn't find them uncomfortable as many people have. I've had other problems, though:1) I like to use my own mic for recording stuff into my computer, and the cord of these headphones get very thick at the end, near the plug, and since there isn't much space between the mic and the speaker jack, I always had to use my mic and headphones separately.2) The plastic near the cups broke, and I can't be bothered to research the warranty. Just bought a Sennheiser CX300 today."
4,A quick warning,"I've been using these headphones for about two years now, and I love them. The only problem is that I've used them so much that the vinyl covers on the ear pads have decayed. The right ear went first, and after a bit of searching I found replacement pads(part #211566701) for $4 on Sony's supply site.I should've bought two, because now the left ear is shredded (which drastically reduces the sound quality) and Sony's site has replaced the nice cheap pad with a $14 model (part #211566702). I love these headphones, but for that price I could just about buy a brand new set.Long story short, enjoy them while they last. They're excellent headphones for the price, but if you use them every day, the ear pads will eventually fall apart and replacements aren't worth buying."
3,Blooper mars otherwise charming story,"A Jewish holiday, a funny and fanciful Jewish story make this book in many ways utterly charming. Even nominally traditional Jewish dietary laws are ignored, however, when the author serves the story's assembled family latkes, sour cream, and chicken (among other things) for dinner. An unfortunate error in judgment, in this reader's view."
3,It's ok - but its hard to control,It's an ok game. I find it difficult to move around the game.and I'm 30+ years old. I was showing my boy how to use it.But I myself had a hardtime. But Its a good game
1,Terrible!,"This is a terrible game for kids, my daughter is 5 years old and she is a basic reader but could not do even one word as the game is too fast even at level one. Also it takes too long to do a word and is a very slow way of learning words. Avoid!"
4,"My kid likes it, so I like it.","I thought the game seemed dull, but my son likes it - so my opinion is meaningless.Kids are required to go through a maze and spell words while avoiding obstacles. Level one is 3 letter words, higher levels have larger words. Sometimes I have a hard time understanding what word the game is saying to spell but I guess it is just me because my son doesn't complain about it.It isn't his favorite game (he has 12 leapster games total) I would say this is his 4th or 5th favorite game)"
5,Great update for an old game,They have done an excellent job updating this game. No longer the mostly boring dice fest it once was. With a built in limit on how long the game lasts easy to play in under 2 hours if everyone has played once.
5,BUY THIS!!!!!!!!,FUN FOR EVERYONE IT HAS THICK FIGURES THAT WONT BRAKE IT CAN BE A LONG OR SHORT GAME.....JUST TRY TO CONQUER WORLD DOMINATION!!!!!
5,"""LOADS"" of fun",when me and my friend first played this game... i blew a load because i was so happy....and he then skeeted all over the wall!!! we were so happy that we had all of our friends come over...and they played and busted as well!
1,Too much work... becomes boring when not your turn,Too hard and confusing! Excessive effort require to play.
1,Risk is the worst,"My god, I have never seen a game as boring as this. I mean really, who wants to throw dice and kill little 2cm soldiers all day? Who could possibly be that sad? No offence to all you hardcore Risk fans, but Risk is just way too boring for me. I have played all sorts of board games, but I must say that even Digimon Adventure Official Board game was better than this. Anyone who is planning to buy this, DON'T. I really mean it. You'll regret buying it for your entire life..."
4,Risk plus much more,This game adds some of the elements that our family had already added to original Risk game to make it more challenging. You will need to change your strategies because there are twists to this new version that makes the old way obsolete. I did not rate it 5 stars because there is a learning curve here that some may not like.
4,Alright,"It's similar to the original Risk in a lot of ways, but where it's different it's WAY different. The nice thing about it is it moves much faster than the original. You can seriously complete a game in under an hour. One of the added features are leader pieces that give you the ability to conquer underwater cities and lunar territories, as well as the continents.There are also command cards that can do everything from booby trapping an attacking force, to demolishing enemy troops with missile strikes. I've played it with people who absolutely detested the first game, but really enjoyed this one."
5,Risk is awesome,"Risk itself is a great game. Risk 2210 takes it to a whole new level. You're gonna need at least 5 hours to play, but they go by pretty fast. Fans of the original Risk game can get this one because you can play the original rules, or the expanded/modified 2210 game which is actually a lot of fun. Highly recommend it."
4,Not bad,"I just purchased this game and recived it today. I was a little disapointed at the fact that the units were in plastic and the moon / holders were that cardboard, only because i worry on the durability. Overall its a wonderfull game, in my own opinion much more fun than the classic risk and lord of the rings edition ( which i also own and suggest). It makes for wonderfull gameplay, and litteraly hours of fun. I gave 3 stars under how durible just because of my fear of the cardboard peices getting messed up. Other than that its a 5 star fun."
3,O.K. but house rules needed...,"I liked this new version of Risk but house rules are probably needed. It has been years since I originally played Risk 2210 but I remember some unbalancing situations, including but not limited to, frequency jam cards being way too powerful in a two player game. I don't mind house rules but it is a little frustrating to have to figure out any significant number of them to make a game enjoyable."
5,overall a great game,i think this version of risk is great! it is so much fun. my friends and i get together all the time and play it. i gave it 5 stars for educational value because you need to use many skills in order to win. the game is all about strategy. i gave it 5 stars for durablity because i have a dog and a little sister and it holds up very well. i think that it should be for 12 and older because i also have a 10 year old sister and there is no way she could understand it. overall this is a great game for those who like to have a challenge and like to stratigize.
3,Missing pieces.,"I bought this game to play with my friends during the night hours, and I must say it is very fun. First time learning to play took about 6 hours, and games range from 2 to 5 hours now. The only complaint I have is that I'm missing all of the MOD-5 pieces for red and the Nuclear commander for black. Kind of disappointed with the lack of quality put into that. I also wish the devastation markers and energy points were plastic, and the moon board was thicker."
2,Nearly unbearable,"This cd, as Kylie herself has put it, her worst album and is ""very choppy and 'Japanese.'"" In the beginning, it's pretty OK to listen to, but by the end I was begging for it to stop. It sounds almost like a bootleg megamix deal. The bonus track, 51 - Celebration (Techno Rave Mix) isn't anything extraordinary either. I give this cd one star just cuz its Kylie, and another for effort."
3,non stop kylie fun!,"This Cd may seem odd at first listen, but it is a great overview of the early years of Kylie music. This was one of the first Kylie Cds' i bought and it was also the one that lead me to buy all of her albums!!it features 50 songs from her first four albums plus some b-sides and rarities. however the celebration remix (which makes track 51) is very dodgy. but apart from that, the songs are slightly remixed and shorted and basically given a feel for before the next tract begins. i recommend this cd if you are unsure about buying older kylie minogue Cds"
4,Great service and product,"This product was exactly as stated. The garnet was an even deeper, yet still vibrant red. The cut outs in the silver were not as defined as in the picture but still look good.I had the ring re-sized and the stone looks massive. This was a great gift for myself and I think any women would love to have this ring.Oh and it was here in just a few days instead of the full 2 weeks."
4,Missing an important aria,"Everyone who knows Le Nozze di Figaro cannot forget Susana and Contessa's Sull' Aria...Che Soave Zefiretto. However, this highlights CD does not contain this aria...very disappointing. Other than that, however, it's a pretty good compilation."
5,The BEST - non addicting!,"I have been using Donell Lip Saver for well over 10 years (was introduced to it by my Dermatologist while on Accutane). It is THE BEST ""lip stuff"" hands down. It doesn't even compare to the drugstore and grocery store $2 or $3 stuff. You absolutely get what you pay for and this is worth the money. I keep these all over my house and in all my bags and purses. Whenever I run out and have to use something else on my lips, I can feel the difference. Excellent product."
4,Roger's level review,stabilia makes a good levelexpected different end caps (rubberized caps)but other than that okay deal
5,"If you haven't read this book, then you are missing out","This book is the sequel to Dancing On the Edge of the Roof. Both books are excellent. In this sequel the main character further develops into this amazing indepedent woman that had no experience outside her home town of OHIO. I love the adventures that goes on and the people that surround her and support her. How many of us thought that it would be wonderful to packet it up and leave but stay because of our family obligations. Join in Juanita's search for love, happiness and adventure. You will not be disappointed."
4,How to play the trumpet like singing,"Wonderful music beautifully played by Sergei, what else need to say? It's always amazing to hear virtuosistic play but I indeed welcome nice melodies. Go on Sergei!"
3,Elegie with a trumpet,"Looking for Elegie. It was the correct piece, but I would have preferred it done with violins etc. Elegie was my mother's favorite piece."
5,Great find and fun to listen to,"I am a long-time fan of Men Without Hats, and consider them to be criminally underrated. Ivan has a unique and powerful voice, and he surrounds it with some fantastic synth-pop rhythms on this CD. I really didn't know it existed until recently. A great find for anyone who even remotely enjoys MWH. This album is actually better, in my opinion, than the more recently released MWH's No Hats Beyond This Point. The Spell is almost a guilty pleasure. I find it great for my jogs! Fun and puts most of the new garbage music out nowadays to shame. Rock on Ivan!"
2,Embarassing...,"... nearly all the Men Without Hats' albums blew this tripe out of the water. After taking years and years off, Ivan made this album on his computer in a basement... what he came up with was a mere ten ...songs. A few of them manage to be catchy and ALMOST good enough to even hold up against MWH stuff, such as Open Your Eyes or Superbadgirls, but I can't help but laugh to myself with the ...lyrics, predictable techno background music, and the ""rap"" section of WWW (hopefully that one was intentionally funny)... and hopefully MWH put out their long-awaited follow-up to Sideways and show these reviewers that Ivan can do MUCH better..."
2,Don't use if feeding right away...too many bubbles,"If you use this mixer and feed your baby right away, you will be giving him/her seltzer formula that will cause major tummy upset. OK, only if you mix formula well in advance. I found that it'smuch better to make cappachinos and margaritas frothy."
1,Worked Great for 2 Days,I bought this because my son's formula is so hard to mix. It worked great for only two days and then died. It is not worth the money.
3,A Tad Cumbersome...,"Well, I never like those reviews that give an item 1 star because it wasn't what they were expecting... however I will say that this was a little larger than I was expecting (approximately 5 inches in diameter) and yet this is not why I gave it 3 stars.It received 3 stars because the lid of the box, which is evident by the picture now being used by Amazon, rotates around a pivot on one side. Thus, when the box is fully open, it has grown to a length of about 9 inches... a little big (in my opinion)... but the worst part is that you have to use 2 hands to open it. It does not have rubber feet on the bottom and consequently slides when trying to open the lid with one hand...Overall, however, this is a bamboo salt box and for it's function it is perfect as it holds a considerable amount of salt, and the bamboo is hard, stain resistant and frankly quite pretty."
1,Lid Annoying,This is a nice looking salt box. The lid is terrible. It feels loose but at the same time its difficult to rotate. Not recommended.
3,ok but can be better,"Its a great fork for tuning with an amp, but without one its a pain. Since the fork is so small it does not produce enough vibration for a loud sound."
3,A bit small,This product is a bit smaller than I thought it would be. I should have been more careful by reading the entire description.
5,Good Product Thanks !!,"I am really happy with my new A Tuning Fork, it's a good product and well priced, it's nice to have a Tuning Fork again after years of not having an accurate way to tune my guitar, thanks for the prompt and good service as well Cheers !!"
3,Not pleased with advertising.,I was not pleased because the vendor did not indicate the frequency of the tone of this tuning fork. It is one octave lower than I wanted.
2,Tuning Fork,"Watch the ad picture carefully. Thought I was buying three (3) tuning forks (A,C & E)as in the picture. Instead only one (1) C was for that price."
1,HORRIBLE!,We would of given this a zero if we had the choice. So it got one star from us. We watched this movie a couple of weeks ago and we still can't get over this trash. I also broke the disc in half. I wanted to crawl under a rock when the sex scenes came on and we were watching it with my 13yr. old son. WARNING WARNING! DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE.
1,should have 'X' rating,This is just porn with a spiritual tag. The acting is laughable and the plot has nothing to do with the rapture. Even the $5.97 price was a waste of money.
1,"I didn't buy this, don't know why I am asked to review it!",I viewed this product with my curiosity piqued upon seeing the actress Mimi Rogers linked with the rapture. I quickly realized it was a parody mocking the Bible and did not purchase it but am sure I would NOT recommend it!
3,Not a Christian Movie,"I did think that this movie was interesting and had a point of view that was worth discussion, but this is not a Christian movie. This movie may be called The Rapture and it is about the end of times when some are called home to God, but this is also a deservedly R-rated movie for sex and some violence.The main focus of the movie is the conflict of a woman who suffers from a lack of spiritual focus. She does discover God but even in the discovery of God there is conflict. The point of view of the movie is not a Christian one. It is worth examining, but because this movie was placed under the general heading of Christian video and because its title is The Rapture, people can be misled."
1,Garbage!!! Doesn't deserve any other rating!,"I purchased a Christian video. It was suggested by Amazon, that those who purchased that video, also purchase The Rapture. Perhaps Amazon was not aware of this, but this is a huge misrepresentation. I did not expect to purchase a sexually explicit and sexually bizarre movie. Most Christians try to stay away from watching this type of movie, however, the title is extremly misleading. If I wanted to purchase a sexually explicit movie, I would have purchased one, however, I resent being tricked into purchasing one because the title is Christian in nature. Besides this, the movie is totally depressing after you get past the trashy sex part. What a piece of garbage! Little to nothing to do with the Rapture as a Christian knows it. It was almost as if it was thrown in at the end as an afterthought. It makes me angry that some sicko hollywood producer would put out a piece of trash like this to stick it to Christians. Talk about a ""Gotcha"" moment."
1,Warning not a clean movie..,Warning title deceptive....movie description: The acclaimed file the rapture is a sexual and spiritual awakening... a beautiful telephone oprator seeks excitement in orgiastic sex with strangers.. tormented by feelings of emptiness attempts suicide. A hallucinatory religious conversion from a cult-like religion preparing for the rapture...frightening and ultimately tragic. Picture on front is deceptive also.
1,Not a Christian movie at all,"I do not know why this movie is under Christian genre. It clearly has nothing to do with Christianity, nor the rapture. It makes fun of Christians and portrays them as mindless idiots. It is highly offensive and disgusting."
4,"Original, Daring Work.","""The Rapture"" is one of those few films that dares to go where most movies are afraid to go to. Michael Tolkin here displays a brilliance for screenwriting. He explores a topic that many believe in and others don't. I am so tired of some directors afraid to touch subjects like religion. Here, Tolkin creates an intriguing, interesting, deeply powerful film about the belief in the second coming of Christ. This movie appreciates Biblical scripture more than Martin Scorsese's ""The Last Temptation Of Christ."" This is also the closest film that I think, shows what it would really be like if the book of Revelation is indeed, the truth. There are powerful and stunning moments. The cinematography is well-done as well the writing and acting. This is a thinking person's film. Those who appreciate creativity and intelligence in a film should see it. Sure, it gets a little slow at times, but it's still a good, original, and daring piece of film."
5,an AMAZING film,"I'm shocked at the number of self-professing ""Christians"" blasting this movie here. Just the fact that ""The Rapture"" has been hailed by both Christians and non-Christians should tell people that this is a truly intelligent, thought-provoking movie. As a Christian who believes in the rapture, I'd rather sit down with an atheist friend to watch this movie than ANY of the cheap, poorly made, and poorly acted drivel that makes up the regular ""Christian"" movie market (eg, the ""Left Behind"" movies...) This movie is so cleverly written, that both people who believe in a rapture, and those who don't, can end up believing the film supports their position. Just what BETTER platform can you have to generate honest discussion, than something like THAT??Clearly most of the ""Christians"" blasting the movie are doing so because of the sex. I guess these would be the same types of people as those pharisees and hypocrites who blasted Jesus for hanging out with the ""sinners""."
1,"If you are Christian, this is NOT the movie for you!","It seemed to me that this movie was an excuse to have soft-core porn, The Apocalypse, and weird ideas about the end of the world all rolled into one...This movie takes very little from ""normal"" Christian beliefs about the Rapture, and makes a poor victim of the main character, played by Mimi Rogers. Rogers gave a good performance, but the writing was non-Christian and seemed to be somebody's bad dream written into a screenplay. I can see how some people might think it is brilliant, but I, for one, thought it was awful. The movie did not even resolve itself in a logical way. If I could have, I would have given it ""0"" stars!"
2,NOT what I expected...,"I thought I carefully read the reviews before purchasing this movie, but perhaps I didn't read enough of them. Cultish and distorted to say the least. More like an excuse for gratuitous sex scenes, and to make Christians look like nut cases. No one would really learn much about the Rapture from this movie, or about what it means to be saved through faith in Jesus Christ. But you will learn about swinging and sexual positions, if that interests you. Unfortunate."
1,waste of my time,"a very confusing, poorly acted movie. the character played by mimi rogers was so confusing--from being a sex-crazed nympho to a so called born agin she had the same pained look on her face. it was hard to feel anything for these characters---even when they turned to religion they were unlikeable. the desert scenes left a very bad taste in my mouth. I think it was an attempt to make you think more about religion, all it made me think about was that david duchovny must have been really hard up for cash to have been in such a lousy film."
1,Waste of Time,"This movie was one of the biggest wastes of my precious time ever. I kept watching hoping that it would get better, but it never did. It just spiralled downward into an incomprehensible mess. It was one of those movies that you're not sure if it's really over or not and you keep asking "" What WAS that?"" Save your money and your time. It's better spent elsewhere."
1,Possibly the worst movie ever made..,"This movie is like a bad student film on a big budget: wooden acting, no direction, and then some sex thrown in to try and make up for its shortcomings. If you like to make fun of movies ""Mystery Science Theatre""-style, then you should definitely watch it. Otherwise, skip it."
1,I am a christian and I was affended by this movie,"I gave this move to my daughter and she also said, she had to throw it away as it sounds like a christian movie but from the start you would not have a desire to finish watching it , and I add my daughter is not a christian.."
2,Frightening,"Gives a good idea of what happens to a person who is lost, searching for meaning and stubles into the religious room, with no doors left to open.Good acting, some startling scenes."
2,Boring,I didn't like it and in the end that is not what will happen. how she just says on earth an her daughter goes to heaven... She would go to hell and they didnt tell the whole story............
3,not for children,"This is a great film but when i purchased the DVD, i was hoping to add it to my family catalog. For some strange reasons i choose to view it with my wife before and ho no, the first seems are so not for children, but i understand the message."
2,Disappointed:,"I really wanted to like this movie, but I wasn't able to. The characters just didn't ring true. The ending was HORRIBLE!"
3,Apocalypse then...,"I was really surprised at the level of involvement I had with this film. On the surface, a movie about a bored hedonist who has a religious conversion and goes into the desert to await the coming of the Lord doesn't sound like something that would appeal. Yet the performances - particularly Mimi Rogers (as Sharon) - make it worthwhile.It is slow-paced but not overly so. (I watched it with my daughter who was bored to tears- but hey it isn't an action movie.)A film about religion (well faith) is something that doesn't exactly make it to the Multi-plexes very often but the subject matter it raises is worth exploring.In the end I was extremely moved by Sharon's plight and the denoument, when it came, was devastating even though I had been expecting it."
4,A powerful film,"I first heard of this film while watching Rodger Ebert shred it on his show. He was downright offended by it, and did everything he could to discourage people from watching it. So of course, I did. It was a very raw telling of the rapture story from Revelations in the Bible. I really enjoyed it because the movie makes you think. Mimi Rodgers was pretty interesting in the film and her performance was her best. It does not really deserve an ""R"" rating, but Mimi gives some full frontal nudity in her sex scenes and I don't think it was in the least gratuitous. I'm glad they didn't edit that out for a PG rating, because for me, it made the scenes very real. No matter what your views on Christianity, this movie is a piece of art and worth watching."
3,only partly successful,"Controversial and somewhat disjointed, this is a look at one woman's journey through emptiness and promiscuity to being born again to becoming religiously delusional and finally to rejecting her faith. It would have worked better had the writer/director pulled it together more cohesively; as it is, there are a lot of blanks that are never filled in."
1,Title and Cover misleading,"Did not watch. The title and cover is misleading. All about sex, Rated R. Did not watch, threw in trash! I thought it a religous movie, about how people felt as if the Rapture had happened. But it was about a cult."
1,Not recommended even for entertainment,"have been teaching the book of revelation and end time events to my Sunday school class and occasionally use movies to supplement teaching. I was ordering 4 different dvd's to select one or two to show class(all adults. I previewed this film at home and was very dissapointed in it. would definitely would not use this. Would consider this a wolf in sheep's clothing. Watched the movie thru and then threw it in the trash. Very little ""Christian ""value in it. Not really Bible accurate. (example) with the white horsemen carrying a bow with an arrow in it. Nothing is said about arrows, quite a important fact, when you study the importance of an emply quiver in history. I do not think it necessary to show people similating sexual intercoarse. Leave this movie alone. Talk about wasted time and money."
1,a full of confusion.,"I'm more curious how Fundamentalists will justify this film. David Duchovny character was ex-con, killed a man instead of delivering himself, turned to be a born-again; who had mark/tattoo of meeting with god -- Pearl -- later going on indelicacy; the pedocide was the key to meet the holy? Who believed god but didn't see the relatively in university were the most who suffered indeed."
1,Horrible Move & not what I thought I was getting either ...,"I mistook this film (by it's name) to be on the subject of the Rapture of God's people, per Biblical prophecy. What I got was a horribly confuseing and dowright blasphemous film ... bad story-line, bad acting, bad, bad, bad ... If you are looking for something with ""Biblical"" content ... this ISN'T it ! P.S. I gave it a ""1 star"" because there was no choice for ""zero stars""."
1,the Rapture,"There is not much to write about regarding The Rapture. I dontthink its worth the film it took to make it. Its Boring,and I could'nt waite for it to end. Not worth thinking about. Its a [messed] up movie not worth two cents."
1,The Rapture,"I was totally shocked to find this movie in the christian section. To me, it should have been in the x-rated section. So much graphic porn at the beginning was awful.I advise not to order this movie unless you have no problem with nudity. .So glad I wasn't in mixed company when I saw the start of this...again...terrible..."
1,The Rapture,"this is NOT a movie that will encourage you of how Rapture will be. It is such a foolishness to focus on the WRONG meaning of Revelation and expound it in this movie. The movie did not show the power of the Holy spirit that gives us wisdom and power to do God's will. Instead, on human wisdom that mostly leads us to darkness!This movie is a real JUNK! It landed in our dustbin after watching it."
1,The Rapture,"As a devote Christian I was so taken of guard by this MOST perverted movie that dared to call itself a Christian movie. Blasphemy at worst. Aren't you ashamed of yourself in presenting this as a Christian movie. But, I did not pay attention to the fact that this perversion of a movie is rated ""R"". I thought since when is a Christian movie rate ""R"". I watched this only from the beginning and it turned my stomach. I turned it off and NO I am not asking for my money back I destroyed this tasteless piece of deception. This is NOT what JESUS is all about, nor the message HE preaches. I truly feel sorry for you."
1,Functionally Inferior,"Oops! One would expect by looking at the photo of this phone that it would rest in the charger when not in use. Wrong! According to Panasonic the charger is only for charging a completely dead phone. If you rest them in their chargers instead of letting the battery completely discharge, the battery will die a very early death.Very poor functionally. Panasonic says that you cannot change the type of battery that is used. Their suggestion is to buy new phones that have different batteries. Crazy!Costco just started carrying these phones. There will be millions of expensive headaches!PS When our phones went dead Panasonic's batteries were on back order."
5,Great DVD for better well being,"Having struggled with my weight for many years, I found the information in this DVD to be refreshing and educational. It's not just do this, do that. Instead it's if you do this, this if the effect.Dr. Douillard takes his time to make sure his audience understands the basics of good nutrition and nutrition that moves with the seasons. He moves from the general explanation of Ayurveda for health into mini video lessons on how to breath, meditate, improve personal eating habits and some cool yoga moves.If you're looking for something a little different, this could be a great video for you."
2,Title is the only thing interesting about this book,"Regionalism across the North South Divide is not for the novice reader. This book is a compilation of case studies from several authors and is very difficult to read. This book is nothing but fact after fact on several different countries. The writers present an entire idea in one sentence and move to the next idea, without allowing the reader to digest the information already presented. It is a shame this book is so poor because I am interested in the subject but don't feel I gained anything from this book. I would have given it one star but made it two because it does contain a lot of facts in relation to globalization in lesser-developed countries. The editors condensed way too much information into this book and lost the free-flow of thoughts and ease of comprehension. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
3,Not alot here,"Very basic Tagalog lesson, but if you need a starting point not to bad if you got a few bucks."
1,piece of #$*&,what junk. save your money and don't buy this product. had it only a year and it broke. total crap
1,Disappointing & Lasted Only 6 Months,"I bought one of these 6 months ago. It worked fine, looks great, but then just stopped cooling. I could live with the constantly running fan, but when it stopped cooling, I returned it to the retailer who had since discontinued carrying the item. Price paid was reasonable ($70), but not up to my expectations for a Cuisinart branded product. I would suggest looking at other products before being drawn in by the price."
2,Doesn't last more than a year!!,I received this for a wedding gift and it lasted 8 months before it just quit working. It was nice while it lasted. Good thing I was able to take it back for a store credit. When i took it back to the store 2 people i had talked to there had similar stories with their Cuisinart wine cellar.Cuisinart should stick to food processors and blenders.
1,Not durable,"I bought two of these. First thing I noticed was they ran constantly. One year later, one has quit completely but fans spinning, the other making a God awful racket, unplugged."
4,Small wine cellar,Cuisinar small wine refrig - just the right size - was delievered promtly. Replaces one exactly the same size and brand.
2,not so happy,"Good:* Nice looking, well built* Digital display with presets for easy temperature setting* Interior lightBad:* Constantly powering on and off every 2 minutes for 20-30 seconds* Noisy fan while powered on. Louder than a full-sized fridge.* In the event of a power failure, the unit defaults to the coldest setting (45F) which is a more drastic temperature range than if I left my wine on the counter.Update: My electric bill went up 157% after plugging in this unit. I would reduce this to zero stars, but Amazon won't let me change my rating.DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!!!"
1,Big Disappointment,"Cuisinart claims this operates quietly. This is not true. The unit has a very noisy fan. The fan comes on every few seconds, runs for a few seconds and then shuts off for a few seconds. This cycle continuosly repeats and needless to say it is very noticeable and annoying. I've followed the directions and tried all the presets but it doesn't seem to matter. What a disappointment from what I thought was a reputable company."
1,Dissatisfied,"As many of the other reviews say, this unit is not a quality unit. Despite following all instructions the unit runs for 30sec, stops for 30sec and then repeats itself. This is very annoying and I would assume a big drain on electriciy. It has not mattered how cool the room is, where I position the unit, or even what setting I set it to. Even in a 67deg room, the unit runs constantly to keep the internal temp at 57deg. We got this as a gift from my parents, and I called the company to ask if it should be running so much. They asked me to send it back, which cost almost $60 because it had to be specially packaged by UPS to be sure it didn't break. We got a new unit and it still runs the same way. I haven't been able to get the company to refund the money I spent to ship the first unit back and they keep giving me the run around, acting like it is something that I am doing to make the unit run constantly. Very disappointed in a company that I thought was high quality."
1,Not what I hoped for...very dissappointing!,"I bought this product hoping to be able to help preserve some of my better wines during the warm summer months. According to the insert with the product, if the room temperature is 77 then you can't do better than 54 in the wine cellar. My house temps usually run around 78 through the summer, so this unit won't even make the 54 setting. I have it set at 64 and it continuously cycles on an off with a fan that's very obnoxious and not at all quiet as advertised. On the insert and in bold letters they state ""This is a wine cellar, not a refrigerator."" I'm not so sure I would even call it a 'wine cellar'...more of an energy gulper (approx. 100 watts according to the user guide.)"
1,Not a Good Product,"We got this product as a gift and were very excited. The first unit we tried stopped working within the first 3 hours of turning the product on. We noticed a glue like substace dripping from the back of the Cuisinart Wine Cellar and an electrical fire type smell. After trading the unit in for a new one we thought things could only get better. We were wrong our next unit continues to work but the fan cycles on and off every 30 seconds. This fan is not quiet as advertised. We have tried different plugs and locations, but the fan persists. I can hear the electric bill going up as I write this review."
1,Very bad product by cuisinart - wine cellar,"I bought this for my wife for Mother's Day. It's been running for one week and the temperature is only down to 55 degrees. We followed the direction to a ""t"" and are very dissapointed. I put a digital thermomater in the unit to see how cold it actually was because it's been running nonstop for a week. I wouldn't buy this unit."
2,Noisy and Too Large for a Counter,"This product looks pretty and all, but it runs all the time and is very noisy. We had it on our kitchen counter and had to move it to the basement b/c it was so loud...louder than our giant kitchen fridge. We got it b/c we are red wine lovers and prefer it slightly chilled. My advice: stick your favorite red in the regular fridge for 20-30 minutes and you're set!"
2,Misleading Picture,Don't be confuse by Amazon's slick pictures. The transmitter for the Sony Wireless Speaker is not included. Misleading advertising. Couldn't tell you if the speakers any good.
1,what garbage!!!,"i can't believe the people at sony are producing this junk. The only place this thing works is right next to the transmitter, with static and hissing. it doesn't even work in the next room 15 feet away. this thing blows - don't even bother with it. i'll be sending it back asap."
2,poor sound,"Disappointed & I have sent this product back.No matter where it was placed , it continued to hiss ( even when it was 2 ft away from the transmitter ).I would consider other options if you want clear sound."
1,There is so much interference you can barely hear,Plain and simple: DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT; IT IS HORRIBLE!!!YOU CANT HEAR ANYTHING
3,"OK, but not impressed","I purchased this to place on a patio deck to hear XM music played over our multimedia system inside. It did a fairly good job, but at times the static was annoying. It was only 20' from the inside amplifier and it still required constant tuning and relocations around the deck to get the best signal. Overall, I think it's a much needed device (as are any wireless speakers for outside), but the engineers need to use this stuff instead of just designing it on paper. Do I recommend it? Only if you have absolutely no alternative."
3,"Pretty speakers, passable sound","Beautiful design, lovely blue glow, easy to set up and use. Another reviewer wrote that these speakers sound as good as regular, wired speakers. Are you kidding?? Oh, please!! I bought these speakers because of that review, and while the sound from these speakers is ""okay,"" it's not even remotely (forgive the pun) in the same league as wired speakers costing far, far less. I guess that I am satisfied with the speakers overall--using them to fill in the sound in a room where my regular speakers don't reach, but I don't see how they could possibly be used on their own by someone who loves their music and has an ear for good sound. I do look forward to being able to take these outside for summer evenings, etc. I also look forward to the day of truly good wireless speakers. Hopefully, when those speakers arrive, they will look as good as these."
1,Very Unsatisfactory I'm returning.,"Loud HISS all the time. The sound comes and goes all the time. Works 10 mins. then stops. Have to turn volume up loud to get it back. When working sounds ok. But will not continue working. I have a pretty new Sony TV and am only 12 feet away but the unit just does not work. Shame, I liked it when it worked."
3,Sony Wireless Speaker Good Enough,"The best thing about this is that I can walk around in the house with the speaker on battery in the morning while I'm getting ready for work and listen to my favorite news podcast.The reception isn't perfect, especially if my body gets in the way of the signal and if I'm behind some closed doors.My wife is generally not that impressed with it and if it was up to her, we'd be returning it. Most places in the kitchen cannot pickup the signal or its horribly spotty. p\Probably because of the portable phone or the microwave or who knows what. But her biggest beef is that for a wireless device we end up with so many new wires: wires to plug the base in. Wires from the base to the laptop. Wires to the speaker charger.All in all, its just good enough so that its not worth the hassle of packing it up and returning. I want better reception and it would have been better if the base could wirelessly connect to the laptop."
2,Your system will sound like a distant 100-watt FM station...,"I really want to like these speakers -- their overall design is terrific and they look very sharp, they don't take up much space, they can be taken outdoors.That said, they are terribly prone to interference, static and the usual host of ills that plague all wireless speakers to date.These particular speakers can make your favorite CDs sound like they're being broadcast from a very weak, faraway FM station -- slushy and with varying amounts of static.Until a superior wireless speaker is manufactured, you're betting off living with the limitations of speaker cable."
1,Makes too much noise to live with,"My wife bought me a Sony Wireless Speaker System as a birthday gift. Actually I helped her select the gift because after all it was for me!. I read some reviews posted on Amazon about this Sony system and most of them said it was 'excellent.' As soon as I tried it myself, however, I knew I had to disagree with them. Sony Wireless Speaker System, if better than others on the market, still makes too much noise to live with even when the speaker is only a couple of feet away from the transmitter, let alone when they are farther apart. I'm returning it today. Hope my experience prevent many other potential buyers from wasting their time."
3,Too much interference and noise,"I installed this system hoping to avoid running wires. The result was not satisfactory in my case. In my house none of the three available broadcast channels was able to broadcast noiselessly beyond about 20 feet. Beyond this distance, speaker placement was critical to avoid noise and interference. Even when I found a good clear-sounding location, the speakers were affected by persons walking around the house introducting reflections causing FM multipath-type distortion. If you aren't picky about the sound you may be able to use this system, but in my case I'm going to run hard-wired speakers instead."
1,Wireless Speakers needs wires,This speaker is reported to go many feet from source. Maybe in a football field where there are no walls to inhibit the transmission. The sound dropped off 20 feet away and when it did work it was tinny. I do not recommend this at all.
2,false advertising,"my husband and I ordered this ring for our wedding bands. I can only wear sterling silver because of skin sensitivity...this ring IS NOT STERLING SILVER. My finger turned green after wearing it for only a few hours. there was no ""925"" stamp on the ring either like they said.I'm very disappointed."
2,"OK for gaming, but...","I ordered this pair of headphones with microphone so I could talk to my teammates while playing multiplayer games online while using the Roger Wilco software. The set works alright for this purpose. The microphone picks up my voice fairly well. However, attaching the mic to the headset was somewhat difficult, and I thought I would break it in the process (very tight fit & cheap plastic.) As for the sound quality, it is adaquate for online gaming, however, they they don't put out very much bass at all. A cheap $... pair of headphones can be purchased at any electronics store which will produce a bit better sound quality (but no microphone.)"
2,"Good speakers, bad microphone","Good solid speakers with the quality you could expect from a low cost Yamaha product. The sound is even better if you plug them into the base of your external powered speakers or system. The microphone, on the other hand, is of a very bad quality. It's hard to install and has very limited mobility. I returned mine after a day because it was just too annoying."
3,Rambling Rose,"This book has very useful information and that's probably why my spiritual companioning class wants me to read it - BUT - it rambles. Get to the point! Did you have to coin your own new system for us to try and follow? I have read other books with this slant that were easier to read and more to the point. The conclusion of each chapter gets to the point.I did purchase a used book and it is not in ""good"" condition - the person who had it previously underlined what seems like the whole book."
2,"Actually ""Sylvie and Bruno Concluded"" and poor formatting","I'm not reviewing the story but this kindle edition. The title is misleading: the text is actually the sequel ""Sylvie and Bruno Concluded"". The formatting is annoyingly bad in patches."
4,Parallel Journeys,"This book is about two people living in two very different worlds. One is a Jew who gets sent to a concentration camp and the other is a member of the Hitler Youth. One strong point was how the author put the book together, on a timeline of events. You get to see both sides of the story. It got me hooked because I was waiting to see what happened to them. I thought this was a very good book to read, especially if you want to teach kids about the Holocaust."
5,Elizabeth,"This book opened my eyes to what really went on in WW2. I think everybody should read this book. It shows both sides of the story, not just what happend to the Jews, but also the Nazis side.If you have a chance to read this book, I recommend that you do. I give it a 2 thumbs up!"
2,Not by Ellery Queen,"This is a bodice-ripper pulp novel that takes place during the Italian Renaissance. The author's real name was Don Tracy. With permission, he borrowed the pseudonym of Barnaby Ross from Ellery Queen, which in turn was the pseudonym of two other men."
5,Brings back memories of childhood...good memories.,This wonderful book makes you realize that your inner feelings of childhood are not at all different from anyone elses. She approaches difficult topics with grace and passion. It's real to the point where you want to reach out to the characters and tell them everything will be alright.
5,excellent,"This book surveys Ancient Egyptian temples, their structures and development. The author endeavors to explain the nature of Egyptian divinities and their need for temples and festivals. He presents interesting ideas regarding the Ancient Egyptians' temples architecture and decoration. An absorbing little book, with numerous remarkable conjectures. Recommended for everyone."
2,not as advertised,Item was not a advertised. Book paper was old. It had more markings than stated by the seller.
4,"Not stylish, but does the job","This Sony SB-V31G Game and Video Selector isn't stylish, but it does it's job. It's easy for kids to use, so I don't have to constantly switch between the DVD player and the Wii for them.If you've got three items to plug in, you're going to have a mess of wires, because of the clunky design. If this will bother you, you may want to purchase one designed to plug all items in to the back.As stated in the title, this product does the job."
2,Requires a video signal,"I wanted to use this to switch between different audio sources and the occasional video source. The problem is that like most other switchers, this requires a video signal to work. Great if you always have that, but for me ... not so great."
1,last time i ever buy from amazon,"i will make this review short and sweet. I am a retro video game collector and i need more av slots on my tv, i ordered this and payed for expedited shipping (2 days); it took 7. that is not the worst part of the story, they sent me the completely wrong device, it is some USPEED device that is not even closely related to the sony video selector"
4,Good product,"This product does exactly what it is intended to do. While we have previously bought other products that was supposed to deliver the same results as this product, they failed. This product has not failed. It's worth the money."
2,Ugly and overpriced,"The photo doesn't make clear that this device, when fully connected, has cables hanging off all sides. Maybe that's OK in some areas like a playroom that doesn't have to look neat, but it's very ugly for any public space of the house. Nor does this product support S-video. I'm returning it. For an extra $4 I'm going with the ""Cables To Go 4x2 switch"":Cables To Go 28750 4x2 S-Video + Composite Video + Stereo Audio Selector Switch (Black), which supports:- An extra output (total of 2)- S-video on all inputs and outputs, as well as composite RCA and stereo-audio- 3 inputs on the back, keeping it neat looking- A 4th input on the front - suitable for temporarily connecting a video camera or other external sourceClean and attractive black packaging.Well worth the slight extra cost in my opinion."
5,Love this book!,This is one of my all-time fave art books.Skewed '60s sex kittens alongside an unusual of cast characters populate masterfully painted worlds with palettes that range from subdued & earthy neutrals through the vibrant hues of fire.Kudos to the publisher for the high quality printing and single sided layout which ensures that there is no bleed through and each image can be thoroughly enjoyed.
5,Dark side of Jack Davis,Glenn Barr!!!!!!!!! Wow this is an awesome book with a collection of his incredible images!!! I'm not positive if Glenn Barr would say who his influence is?? but it seems to me.... to be a Dark side of an old MAD comic book artist named Jack Davis.totally incredible!!
1,too much wasted space,this book has art on one page and nothing on the back of the page!its no good.its art on every other page!i don't recommend this book at all!
2,Handles!,The handles are poorly sewn in to the mattress bag and tore out easily. I like the idea of the product and will sew the handles back in with a heavier thread.
5,Track List,Track Title1. Rebuttal2. Blues Bulletts3. Ain't With You4. Every Time5. Origin6. Blind Eye Blues7. The Reverse8. White Chinese Hair9. Noise Song
2,One Teacher's Opinion,"I just finished reading this book as part of my preparation for a Middle School unit on Bridge Construction, and I am disappointed. If you are looking for a quick and simple reference book, you may be satisfied; however, I found it thin on text (only 24 pages long, including the index), with only two to five paragraphs of collected information, facts and historical bits on each bridge. The text is dry; thus, I am not convinced it would engage young readers, and it offers very little to help kids conceptually understand the different brdige types it features. This book never does answer the question: ""Why are THESE ten bridges America's TOP bridges?""The full page, color photographs do offer good examples of suspension, trestle, cantilever, pontoon, and stone arch bridges, all from the United States. ..."
3,Mixed Pleasure,"I didn't find this anthology as effective in conveying the feel of a place as say, ""A Key West Reader"". Some of the pieces, however, made it worth the purchase - ""Falmouth Whaling Log"" by an anonymous sailor, ""Nantucket"" by Melville and Kurt Vonnegut's ""The Hyannis Port Story"" were gems."
5,Top-Notch Pressure Washer,I borrowed a friend's Generac pressure washer and was pleased with its performance. I decided I couldn't live without my own and it has quickly become my favorite tool. The quick-change nozzles are a dramatic improvement over the adjustable nozzle and the reliability of the Honda engine should ensure many years of use.
5,Great Product + Amazon.com very helpful,"I absolutely love the pressure washer. Its very easy to start (just remember to hold the sprayer open with one hand while starting the engine - makes it real easy)The washer does a great job on concrete, lawnmower, house (vinyl siding) ...My washer arrived with a dented muffler cover (same as mentioned by another reviewer). Amazon[.com] folks did their best to get me a replcement part but could not easily get a hold of it. They offered me a dicsount, full refund, or full replacement. I really appreciate their willingness to please."
2,Won't Last Long,"The first season I used the pressure washer it was great. I never had a problem starting the motor or with the water pressure. The washer was used to wash vinyl siding on three houses, pier, boathouse, ect. The second year it performed as well as the first until the pump bolts broke and started leaking. Now the pump leaks water more than it pumps. The Honda motor still works fine but the pump is garbage. I wouldn't advise anyone to purchase this pressure washer."
1,Beware This Worthless Trash,"This ""Honda"" 5HP engine is designed to break down after about 15-20 hours of use. Honda dealers laughed when I told them which pressure washer I'd been stuck with. The engine is TRASH at best. Do not throw your money away on this piece of junk. By the time you use it for the third or fourth time, unless you attempt to use it commercially, the ""warranty"" will be long gone. Most people use this pressure washer a couple of hours then put it up for months until needed for a couple more hours and by the time it breaks down your past the warranty. Call an authorized Honda motor dealer and ask them about this lemon."
1,Pump on 2400PSi Washer Failed,"After only 2 years of owneship and less than 25 hours of use time the mounting bolts broke on the pump..First one came out and then two more. The repair estimate was $329.00, 90% of the purchase price of the entire unit. The repair shop says the pump is shot and must be replaced. I purchased it from Lowe's, who was no help at all when I contacted them. Generac was even less help than Lowes. Naturally they said the warranty had expired after two years, yes...but less than 25 hours ""RUN"" time. I will buy another one but not Generac and not from Lowes. The 5.5hp Honda motor seems to be reliable, but it only has 25 or less hours also......I just got very much less than I expected from this unit. I would NOT recommend it to anyone."
1,2400 PSI Pressure Washer,"My Generac Pressure washer, which I purchased a little over a year ago, has given me good service until now. But....I have only used it a few times and the pump is shot. I maintained it perfectly and followed all manufacturers recommendations. One of the bolts that mount the pump to the housing broke off and that was the beginning of the problems. It is now in the shop and they want 275.00 to fix it. I only paid 350.00 for it. Beware of these pressure washers. I have been told that most of them that are sold by Home Depot or Lowes are made to be used for a short period of time and that they are considered ""throw aways"" after that time. Very disappointed that Generac uses such cheap parts, knowing full well that they are destined to fail. No more ""Generac brand"" anything for me. Burn me once, shame on you. Burn me twice, shame on me. I would not be too quick to add this one to your shopping cart."
2,Nice unit when it works.,"I was well satisfied with the performance of this unit during the first six months that I used it. The unloader valve started to act up after that time and the pump quit working. I contacted the manufacturer who suggested a service location to repair the problem. Although the unit was still under warantee, I was told that the unloader was not covered, for reasons unknown, and I was required to pay the entire cost of repair myself. The mechanic stated that they had a lot of problems with this particular part. About a month later the unit developed the same problem and quit working again. I have not used it since and refuse to pay another big repair bill. I have since contacted the manufacturer who has yet to get back to me."
3,Bought used for $50,"Bought for $50, old owner said it had no pressure and has had issues over the years. This thing looks like new, new, new and well cared for. Pulled unloader off, plastic black ~1"" fitting on pump. Had to screw a drywall screw into the brass cup hole to be able to pull it out of the alum housing. Used valve grinding paste to re-seat the sealing surfaces so I could test the unit. Got good pressure and performance. Bought a new style unloader from Amazon (#187879GS, Briggs and Strat, $17) that looks like it has a diffirent design and installed it. Had to clean the corosion in the treads. Hopefuly this fixes the issues with the unloaders over time. Destroyed the looks of the old plastic fitting by having to vice grip it off, new unloader comes with a new one any way. Now works like a champ."
1,First of all the game is too easy.,"If you buy the game (and i tell everyone not to)you will find it too easy, i didn't even buy the Stragety Guide cos I ended up finishing the game, if you are an avid RPG player you should'nt need this guide, In other words if you need this book to finish this game there is something wrong with you!"
2,Overpriced and noisy,"Too noisy to watch DVDs or listening to music, lot of static, mostly if you don't stand still like a statue. Very disappointing from Sony. Buy Koss, Sennheiser or Bose. Oh and the connection between the base and the headphones is crap."
3,"Decent Headphones, need some adjustments","I bought these a couple of months ago and use them to watch TV while others in the house are asleep. They work very well, over a pretty decent distance, and are very comfortable. At first I was annoyed with how noisy they were, (compared with IR headphones, there's a lot of noise), but I found that if I crank the tuner to a really high volume (25 out of 30) and then adjust the headphone audio lower, the noise is reduced such that I really don't notice it."
2,Poor for dynamic range of sound,"These are great for the average listener who isn't going to move too far away from the television or stereo while using them.However, I have a major problem with them: I listen to classical music ALOT and the volume constantly adjusts itself so if I get to some loud part in the music, like a cymbal crash or burst of horns, the volume clamps down making what should be a climax in the music I'm listening to sound not much louder than a whisper.That's HORRIBLE and there is nothing that can be done about it. I don't understand.DO NOT by these if you listen to alot of loud/soft music. This is also a problem when watching DVDs."
2,Can't get rid of the static...,"I got these as a Christmas gift. Just tried them out and they are horrible! Couldn't watch an hour long TV show without getting frustrated and just taking them off. Huge amounts of static even though you are close to the transmitter and sitting still. Should you turn your head side to side (never mind walk around the house) you immediately get static in and out. Could be that I live in the city in a house with lots of interference??? But I wouldn't take the chance, given that I agree with other reviewers, the controls are hard to use and the phones don't sit well in the charger."
1,Impossible to adjust headband,"There is no way to adjust the headband, allowing the headset to slide down and off your head. If you move around at all you have to hold the headset in place. Sound quality (because of background hiss) is mediocre."
2,"OK, but has some serious usability issues","Sound quality: Good - But, use with my Yamaha electronic drums is impossible, as the headphones contain circuitry, which constantly clamps the volume.Volume controls: VERY poor. The volume control is very small and I often confuse it with the tuning knob.Comfort: Ok. They are a bit heavy and lack good head adjustments.Battery charger-base: VERY poor. Setting the headphones onto the base, battery charger is somewhat difficult and takes some fiddeling with, every time!"
1,HUH???,Reception is generally terrible. They seem to work only when they want to. It's a big waste of money.
5,Great bag for toting around my jewelry making tools,"Needed a tool box for jewelry making class but don't like the typical plastic or metal ones. Love this one and it's cute, too."
3,cool stuff,Decent book of images found on Google Maps... Each image includes longitude and latitude so you can find them on Google... also has a link for a KML file that loads all the sites in the book plus some others into Google Earth... Worth the price...
5,I really liked this book,"this is the story of astra & richard the book starts with richard looking in on two girls bathing in a water hole,he stays and looks at them get out of the water one is dark haired & the other blonde, astra sences someone and goes to see what it is, at this point she has not put any clothes, she goes over to the bushes, he stepps aside so she could see him she wasps, he smiles and she runs away.they meet again some months later at a fair and then in Henry III's courthe is gready and power hungryshe is kind and loyalhe wants to marry for moneyshe has none"
1,not recommended,"I thought the 'hero', and I use the term loosely, of this book was despicable. I felt sorry for the heroine for being in love with him. He was cruel and manipulative."
2,Not a travel guide,"Sophie has it exactly right. If you're looking for information about travel in Baja, this isn't it. He opens with a long segment on illegal immigration (I assume you're going the other way - legally) and then spends most of the time on the history, flora and fauna of the region. On the other hand, his photography is good and you do get a look at Bahia de Los Angeles and Mulege, two places you want to see. I think there are better travel guides out there."
4,"Good for Macs, too","I was a little concerned about the seemingly poor construction quality (very lightweight and it actually rattles when you gently shake it), but the Linksys hub does work, and I guess I won't be shaking it a lot anyway... Very puzzling that there's no mention anywhere of Macintosh compatibility. The description on the Amazon site is mum about it, and the packaging and the manual state the hub is compatible with various Windows systems -- no mention of Macs. Only the Linksys website states the link works with Macintoshes, too, and in my situation (G3 blue-and-white Yosemite tower), that's true. Plug and play, no hassles."
3,"Does ok, seems reliable, but annoyingly tips","It's construction is fairly cheap and because it's size/weight, the hub tips when placed at the back edge of my desk or tower computer. Not a huge deal, but pretty much all the usb hubs are the same...though I'm going to try the Kensington that is weighted to prevent tipping, has a space-saving standing configuration, has 3 ports in the back of the hub and one in the front- a great idea!"
4,No problem,"I had some doubts after reading some reviews here. Well, I don't see the concerns. You plug it into your USB connection, plug it into the wall, and that's it. I should say that I use XP which may be part of why it was so simple, I didn't try it on any other OS. My one complaint is that Linksys put the electrical outlet, and USB connection on the same side as the 4 ports, instead of the back, which is pretty poor design. Still, if what you need is easy desktop access to your USB ports, or maybe just a couple of extra ports this is the right choice."
5,Good Product !,No non-sense product. Installation is a breeze (doesn't require a CD. The OS detects and chooses the driver by itself) and works well. Not sure why they have 4 green LEDs. They all lit up when the computer starts and shut off when the computer switches off...irrespective of how many devices are connected or not. They could have very well replaced it with just one LED.
1,24 Hour Tech Support Line is a farce,"Purchased this device based on an Amazon customer review. I was expecting a plug & play experience. No such luck, driver problems despite the fact my hardware & software meets minimum requirements.The real rub, cannot get through to a person on the Linksys tech 24 hour a day support phone line. Attempts fail whether day, night, week day, or the weekend. No response via online either."
4,Good device,"I plugged it in, and it worked from the beginning. It is very easy to use, and it is so small I am considering taking it on trips with my USB printer and cdrw."
2,be careful,This is not the compilation of John Peel recordings as is stated.....but just a best of cd. These recordings can be found elsewhere and although the card says its a live album....I see no evidence of that either. If you are looking for an inexpensive look at the band its ok....otherwise look elsewhere.
2,Not Live with lots of filler,"I was quite disappointed with this Atomic Rooster CD. It has exactly 2 tracks Live from BBC ""Tomorrow Night"" & ""Devils Answer"". The version of ""Death Walks Behind You"" is straight off the LP of the same name & I can even hear scratches as if it wasrecorded off a VG- or so copy of the LP. The rest of the tracksappear to be some filler tracks that they dug up somewhere & it does sound as if it is Atomic Rooster but what sub-par material. Definitely not recommended."
4,Bulbs are AMBER,"There's nothing wrong with these bulbs, but make sure you want the amber bulbs. The picture for these bulbs is wrong - they're not clear. And if you want the clear bulbs, there are even better prices for ten packs of those.Also, this is store-shelf packaging, no special packaging for sending through the mail. The bulbs are all together in a plastic bag, in a small box, and then in the Amazon packing. I ended up with 9 bulbs, because one of them was broken in shipment. Not too surprising since they're not separated in any way."
3,Interesting but Boring,Maybe this film has some value to someone studying child psych. The old black and white film is neat. I became bored with it and shut it off.
1,The Alligator,"My husband has been a home inspector for over 25 years and owns a number of Werner fiberglass stepladders. Respecting and trusting in the name, several years ago he purchased the multi-purpose articulated ladder. He was very disappointed when he found out that, to open and close it, each lock must be released individually to go through one motion, until the ladder is fully extended. It is so awkward to open and close that it is analogous to wrestling an alligator. As a result, the ladder has not been used, and has become a dust collector. The comparable ladder, called ""The Little Giant"" by Wing Enterprises, Inc., is far superior. He uses ""The Little Giant"" on a daily basis."
3,Porsche 911 Performance Handbook (Performance Handbook Serie,I have both a late model Turbo and looking for a 993 Supercup. The technical specs are good but the book jumps around in the model years. It is very funny to see Corvette wheels in a Porsche book. There are also too many high dollar advertising plugs. If you use Andial or Promotive to build you an engine-it's gonna cost you 30K. How's that for advise!!
1,I thought this group had no musical talent .,"I like unusual music, but Built to Spill has no talent. I listened to three songs fast forwarded the others, took the CD out of the player repackaged and returned!!!!"
5,these guys are brilliant,these sound bite reviews do this amazing band no justice. you have got to get this c.d. it is awesome....i am hooked. listen to them everyday.
2,Built To Not Too Thrilled,"I love BTS and almost everything they've put out, but when I first listend to Ultimate AW I had to check that I had the right CD. This is nothing like the rest of their music and should defintely not be the first BTS you listen to becuase it will probably turn you off. I think they got a little too experimental with this and deviated from what was working (out of boredom maybe). Whatever the reason, Ultimate Alt is really lacking that awesome, unique BTS sound that is otherwise consitent in their other CDs. If you're looking for some great Built To Spill, check out Keep It Like A Secret, Perfect From Now On, or Nothing Wrong With Love."
5,Wrong information below,"Just to let everyone know, Ultimate Alternative Wavers was NOT released after Perfect From Now On. Ultimate Alternative Wavers was Built to Spill's first album, released on C/Z Records in 1993. Perfect From Now On was their first major label release on Warner Brothers in 1997. Both are incredible. Ultimate Alternative Wavers is where it all began, and with songs like ""Get a Life"" and ""Built to Spill,"" it is sure to please any fan, plus it's fun to hear what the band was doing in the beginning."
2,If you can't say anything nice at all,"Then write an Amazon review. Isn't that how it goes?This battery worked for about an hour talk time at a time. If I charged it every day, talk for an hour in the evening, the battery would be dead when I got up in the morning.There are several varieties of the SNN-5779 battery that fit the Slvr L7: BC50, BC60, and BC70. When I needed a new battery I ordered this one based on it matching the SNN-5779 part number. Only later did I realize that my battery was a BC60 and not the BC50 variety. I trashed this one and ordered a BC60 which gave me two to three days of battery life with an hour or two on the phone per day. I wonder how much more battery life I would get with a BC70."
3,IT'S OK,"Although the mirror is plastic, weighs hardly anything and it looks somehow fragile it is not; it looks good, works well, it installs and fits ok and the more important it does not tremble; it is almost as good as the original metal one.I was a little disappointed when I discovered that by supporting my elbow on the mirror, it could not take this and bent down. I must insist however, it does not shake or even bend, even when driving on irregular road. The bases can be improved with a little creativity but I really didn't have to."
4,Great value,These are nice - great price for 50# of weight. The mechanism to adjust weights is pretty simple but it takes a few times to find the right 'technique.'
5,bayou fitness adjustable dumbbells,I use these weights for p90x they work great. I would advise using workout gloves otherwise you scratch your finger on the screw inside the dumbells.
3,Good Set,"These weights are pretty good, the only downsides are that sometimes the lever sticks, also they are only in 10 pound increments."
3,"Work well, wish they included 5 lbs increments","I am generally happy with these weights, but wish they had been designed to based on 5 lbs increments. They work well, but if I were to make the purchase again, i would have purchased a different brand."
5,Good video quality,Have been using this regularly. No issues. Video quality is good. I'd never pay the astronomical prices that Best Buys of the world ask for.
5,great bargain!!,"a little lightweight, more so than the $30 pair I bought, but works every bit as well. You pay extra for shipping, but still a great bargain!"
5,Zip Disks Rule,These disks are great for backing up your hard drive. No computer owner should be without a zip drive and these disks.
4,"Nicely Accented, Very Light","The watch is nice to look at, and it was purchased for a senior citizen so it needed to be light on her wrist due to arthritis. This gets the job done."
1,EPHEDRA FREE-CAFFIENE KILLS,"IN 11 YEARS THAT I TOOK METABOLIFE 356, NOT ONE TIME DID I EVER HAVE AN ADVERSE REACTION. I TRIED THE NEW EPHEDRA FREE, I COULDN'T SLEEP FOR 3 NIGHTS THE CAFFIENE HAD ME SO WIRED...I CAN'T TOUCH THIS STUFF....."
1,"old metabolife killed people, is this better?","NPR's All Things Considered - November 22, 2002The Secret of Ephedra's Questionable SuccessDiet Aid Makes Billions Despite Claims of Health RisksFor years, Metabolife denied it had received any reports of health problems linked to its popular weight-loss aid, Metabolife 356. But recently, under pressure from the government, the herbal supplement company turned over 15,000 consumer complaints to the Food and Drug Administration. Metabolife lost many large lawsuits, and have some still pending. Generally, Metabolife misrepresented complaints, inflated claims, and ignored serious health problems of consumers. ****"
3,A Nice Addition to a Film Student's Library,"This series of films on DVD makes a nice addition to the library of any student of early silent-era cinema. It includes a sampling of iconic films from some of the important pioneers in motion pictures, including Edison, the Lumiere Brothers, Melies, Pathe, R.W. Paul, Alice Guy, and D.W. Griffith. It offers a way to gauge how quickly film developed from a novelty to a true art form. Viewers, no doubt, will be amused by the early attempts at special effects, editing, and continuity. The only negatives I can offer are that the set is a bit pricey, and the soundtrack (piano) is so loud the narrator (who offers some important contextual anecdotes) is drowned out."
3,List of movies in Volume 4 (Melies),"Here are the shorts in volume 4 (The Magic of Melies): The Untamable Whiskers, The Cook in Trouble, Tchin-Chao Chinese Conjurer, The Wonderful Living Fan, The Mermaid, The Living Playing Cards, The Black Imp, The Enchanted Sedan Chair, The Scheming Gamblers Paradise, The Hilarious Posters, The Mysterious Retort, The Eclipse, The Wandering Stars, Long Distance Wireless Photography, The Impossible Voyage."
1,PRICE IS TOO HIGH FOR WHAT YOU GET,"D.W. Griffith 2 dvd sets have a total time that exceeds this 5 disc volume. In other words, all this material 5 dvd's worth could have been put on 2 dvd's. For the sake of arguement 3 dvd's. I think it was put on five to boost the price. This set should go for around 1/2 price requested for new sets."
4,got exactly what i saw,"Item arrived before stated time, along with helpful info on product! Would use this sell again, and or recommend them."
3,NIV Application Commentary - ACTS,"Great resource for students of the Bible. It's also great for pastors wanting help in preparing sermons. Also, beneficial to those just wanting to reschearch Scriptures."
1,Doesn't do the job for me,"I bought these headphones to make running with my ipod a little easier. (ipod in fannypack carrier is really nice and easy to run with) Phones do not fit my head and, consequently bounce around and the sound level is not very good requiring the volume to be turned way up when compaired to the ipod earbuds. Not a good solution for runners."
5,Nice sound,This has a pretty good sound and is very comfortable on my head during my workouts. You can't beat it for the price.
5,Valuable information and inspiration,This video easily is the best I have seen! So much valuable information regarding paints and finishes. Easy step by step processes shown to create awesome refinished items. That garage sale chest will never be the same. Not the usual 15 minute video...over an hour of course-like presentation. Easy to do faux finishes!
2,um,doesn't really grate or mince garlic. smashes it up but that can be done with the side of your knife and have one less thing to wash afterward.
2,"cute bear, but womb sounds broke down","We were given this as a gift and within a week or two the womb sounds machine was broken. It will only play for about 30 seconds. I can't return it as it was a gift.As a teddy bear, it's very cute and cuddly, and my son loves it, but if you're buying it for the sounds machine then don't bother. We ended up pulling out the machine and stitching the bear back up so it can be a regular teddy bear."
4,Great shower gift!,"My daughter loves this! She is 10 months now and we took out the sounds, which is removable and let her play with the teddy. I have given this bear several times as a new mom shower gift."
5,couldn't live without it!,"This bear has lulled our 18mo old to sleep since birth. it's so soft and has traveled with us everywhere to make bed time secure. I have three! just in case ""Bear"" ever gets lost. I also give this as a baby gift!"
1,Not the product pictured!!!!!!!,"I purchased this bear to replace my son's well loved bear. I specifically ordered this bear from this seller because the picture posted for this item was an exact match to his bear. He is only three and loves his bear more than anything but it is a horrible mess and needed to be replaced. This bear has different colored eyes (blue not black) and has a butterfly on the foot. I have already told my son that his ""mama bear"" was going to the doctor to get her nose fixed and to get a super clean bath and extra fluff. He his expecting me to bring her to his school for his birthday party this afternoon. Now I have to give him this WRONG bear and come up with some reason on why her eyes are a different color and how she now has a tattoo. MY SUGGESTION: DO NOT POST A PIC OF A PRODUCT UNLESS YOU ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO SELL THE PRODUCT PICTURED!! Awful way to do business!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Plays for 5 secs,"We were given this as a gift, and we already had the Sleep Sheep, so it was no huge loss, but it plays the music for 5 secs max. We then have to push the button again -so it's more a teddy bear than a white noise machine. The Sleep Sheep we've had for a year and it's still going strong."
3,Get Lots of Batteries,"This bear works really well for our 2 month old son. He falls asleep more quickly when we play the womb noise and the music and nature sounds are pleasant for other times. I also like that it automatically shuts off after a certain time but I am not sure how much of a battery saver it is. I use duracell batteries with this and it seems that after a week or so, they are dead. We use the bear maybe 3 times a day but a week still seems a bit short lived. I wonder if a white noise machine that plugs in might work just as well..."
3,"6+ mos later, this is a cute crib decoration but I wouldn't buy it again","Having had this bear for almost 7 mos now, I can say that while it's still cute and soft etc, we almost never use the noise machine part because it's on a timer that runs out way too fast. Instead, we use a Dex noise machine for white noise. I still like this bear, but it's really just a crib decoration for us. Wouldn't buy it if I had it to do over again. Looking forward to when our son is older and we can just pull the sound maker and turn this into a toy for him; it'll get a lot more use that way."
4,Big bowl,"Talk about big, I bought it for a salad/pasta bowl. But when not in that use, most of the time, it makes a nice fruit bowl. It can fit 7 large apples in the base, probably stack 3 high. It looks nice so if you pot luck, it can hold a lot. It's as big as a ""that's a bowl""."
5,Fast shipping in a envelope,"My Ventura v-tec Alpha timepiece ran out of battery, it gets its power from a CR1620. Shopped on Amazon and found this one to be the best deal. Battery came brand new in original packet. It arrived in a envelope in my mailbox, the shipping was very fast."
2,poor choice,The coating on this cage came off just like bad paint. Some of the welds were broken. The top was mashed in shipping. I ordered a replacement. I had to return it because of the same damage. Not worth the money.
2,Beware of the contents of this book!,"While Cindy Sherman may be considered a very talented photographer, the later part of her career as portrayed in this book is without a doubt deranged. The photographs contained in this book are truly mortifying. It is frightening that ides like hers could come from the human mind. Her explicit graphics on violence and sex are repulsing to even the most open-minded of audiences. I reccommend using discretion when purchasing this book."
5,One of the BEST!,"This is definatly one of the best books in the series.....When Ashleigh's mare Stardust is injured for the entire summer Ashleigh ""accidentley"" bids a abused, skinny thoroughbred gelding at an auction. The chestnut gelding, Majestic Promise, is brought back to health quickly but is unruly and bossy. Ashleigh knows that if she tells her parents he'll get sold! She wants to ride him badly but there's NO WAY she can. Then a boy that rummors tell her not to go by turns out to have a natural way with horses. When he offers to work with Promise Ashleigh eagrly agrees. Finally, she gets through to Promise but then someone comes to Edgardale...."
2,Get REAL!,"First off Ash is a minor, hence she cannot buy a horse without parental consent(in a formal, written contracts) therefore she wouldn't be allowed in the auction booth without an adult glued to her side. Secondly, why is she always disobeying her parents and GETTING away with it? The series as a whole is way off base from Ashleigh's Diary, and Ashleigh's Hope, which discribe Edgardale and Ashleigh's life according to Campbell.My advice to the future BARAGE of authors: DO YOUR HOMEWORK AND KEEP IT REAL!"
2,AAAHHH!,"I wish this book would have followed through with the other books. Like Stardust being bred to renegade. and how come renegade isnt in this book? he was a racehorse so why cant they race promise too?? and what ever happened to Wanderer and Wanderer's Quest? i thought Wanderer was the best broodmare at Edgardale how come they NEVER menchon her anymore? did i miss something? I think the first few books from this series were MUCH better then these last ones. But i read them anyway lol.One more thing, remember when ashleigh got Lightning and she was abused and skinny and it took like 6 months or whatever to get her ready for riding, why would it only take a couple of weeks to get Promise ready for riding when he had been just as badly abused and malnurished as Lightning? Oh and howcome we never hear about Lightning or Hopewell anymore?? doesnt Ashleigh care about Lightning any more or the kids at Hopewell?"
3,Like the Oistrakh/Rostropovich Brahms Double better,"This isn't bad, but the Oistrakh/Rostropovich recording of the Brahms Double Concerto is more exciting."
1,Bad service,The Visine was good but there was a screw up with the order and I paid $17 for 1 small bottle! Never again!!!
4,Very enlightening,"I really liked this documentary. It was very enlightening for me. The first story in the movie did not thrill me all that much. However, the second story is about a near death experience that happened to Eric Estrada, the star of the popular '70's tv show ""Chips"". I never knew that this had happened to him so it was interesting hearing about it. The last story is the one that really captivated me. It is a story told by a woman who tried to commit suicide. Since I have lost a loved one to suicide, and have also attempted suicide myself, this story really caught my attention. The story she told of what happened to her during this attempt really gave me a different view of what I thought might happen to someone's soul after taking their own life. I did like this movie and do recommend it to anyone who is interested in stories of the afterlife."
5,"""Flavor Affinities"" a huge help","My favorite feature of this guide is the flavor affinities list for each item. The affinities list helps with menu planning and gives you more options for the spice or herb's use. The fact that this book has actual recipes rather than serving suggestions is a bonus. I have a couple of other herb/spice guides, but am most taken with this one."
2,Ok except for one part,"My mother-in-law gave this to my 10-year old daughter for her birthday. She loves to help her grandmother gather fresh herbs from their garden for dinner when she is visiting. It was a good idea except for the chapter about cannabis, AKA marijuana. It lists other common names, tells how it is grown, and even includes some recipes...yes, recipes... along with other things to do with it. Plus, there is a photograph of a dried bunch in the photo section. I am not a prude but I do try and raise my daughter to make good choices and pot is illegal in our state. A consenting adult can make up their own mind. If you are buying online, however, you do not have the option of thumbing through it beforehand."
2,not what i thought it would be,Did not have the details I was looking for and the book is way too small and because of size it's hard too read
5,Attic Windows Quilts,I recently took this class with Cindy Walter at the Houston International Quilt festival. She said the book was out of print but still available at amazon. I wanted more specific instructions that what was handed out in class. the book shows so many more variations than discussed. I was very glad to have purchased it and enjoy the nice photos and instructions. She is an exceptionally vibrant instructor!
4,A no-frills edition of the KJV apocrypha,"I bought this primarily to compliment my otherKJV Bibleand does it very well.It is important to note that this version excludes other ""apocryphal"" books like Psalm 151 and Maccabees 3 and 4. Perhaps a small matter but those studying the Bible could really benenfit from those books."
3,Apocrypha,"My wife and I have had an interest in extrabiblical literature, expecialy this volumn and are reading it together each evening. Our opinion is that it certainly is not inspired, yet we hope to learn a little."
2,Tiny Type,"I love having an Apocrypha but this little book is just too small to be read easily. The paper is nice, not too thin, but the type is really small. I would look for one with larger type."
4,FINDING THE LOST BOOKS,"BEING A HEBREW ISRAELITE, I FELT IT WAS ESSENTIAL TO GET THIS BOOK. I LEARNED THAT THE BOOKS IN THE APOCRYPHA WAS OMITTED BY THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH. HMMMM, I WONDER WHY? I GUESS BECAUSE THE TRUTH HURTS. MY FAVORITE BOOKS IN HERE ARE 1ST AND 2ND ESDRAS AND THE BOOK OF THE MACCABEES."
4,Should be seen and discussed by all Christians,"This documentary is about a Church with a vision they are convinced is from God. At least their pastor thinks so and convinces his congregation to get on board. As the story progresses we start to see how severely deluded this vision is. The filmmaker did not try to make these people look foolish. He lets them tell their own story. The Church has some extremely likeable people including the Pastor who guides them. They are very sincere people and are geniune Christians devoted to God. As things begin to unravel for them, you wonder why God did not intervene in some way. I think this is an important film that needs to be seen and discussed by Christians in small groups. It would be an ideal place to begin a discussion on ""Is that voice we hear really from God?"" or a hundred other topics of people attempting to serve their Creator. Highly recommended."
5,First purchase on Amozon,I was very pleased with my purchase of the Werner 7306 stepladder. I could not find it for less in my area. Thanks Amazon.
5,Great Ladder!!!,The ladder has exceeded my expectation... Has a wider base than most ladders... Not wobbly... Best price for a 12 ' ladder for the quality!!!
1,Can't be compared to the classic Solti set,"This set is very disappointing. Not only is it uncompetitive when faced with the classic Solti set on Decca, the principal singers here are all caught well below their best. Sinopoli's conducting is very idiosyncratic and I don't think it is effectively musically or dramatically. All the other available versions of this opera is better than this one, which should be avoided."
5,How to fight the REAL criminals,"This is a well-organized book that gives a lot of useful info on how to fix the greed-crazy corporate S.O.B's, especially developers and loggers, that are systematically and uncaringly destroying this country for profit. Is this stuff criminal? Well, the laws passed by the corporately paid-for Legislatures may say so, but any real human being knows better. Ludd and Abbey weren't always right, but far milder souls than these may be become too outraged and....at least now they know how to do it right. Don't like it, corporate America? Then shape up your ethics that you learned at Enron."
5,Absolutely Incredible Artistry,"This childhood tale is magically woven from the ancient Hawaiian myth of Maui. The intricate paper cut-outs are exquisitely done and the message of the book is uplifiting and inspiring. Anyone, young or old, will appreciate the beauty of this book."
3,Not strong enough,"I got it, tried it out and then returned it.Why? It's not strong enough.I have been using the Sunpak 55-RL video light for couple of years. It makes the subject well lighted for taking video. The down side of Sunpak 55-RL is it's short run time (about 17 minutes). This LED based video light beats the Sunpak 55-RL in run time. But it's light strength has no comparison to Sunpak 55-RL.Video quality is severely degraded if the subject is not well lighted. You can get one from your local bestbuy or circuit city, tried it out first before ordering it from Amazon."
3,Spotlight,"This is a quite bright little light with a very natural color tone, but a very narrow beam that does not work well with normal to wide lens settings."
3,Universal LED Camcorder light,"This light uses LED bulbs which means it uses less battery energy to run. The unit is small and handy to use. But the big draw back is the actual light. It gives off a very cold looking light. The other problem is that it does NOT give enough light.For very close shots, it is probably good, but longer shots produce very poor lighting.Overall a very nice unit but if it only produced more light!!!"
1,low light panasonic camcorder,very little help for a camcorder thats not good in low light conditions. light range over 5 ft. not noticeable.
5,Very Satisfied,"So here is the thing,I am NOT a Videophile. I don't make movies, I am a frequent video/photo taker.Some say the beam is not wide enough, if your going to be filming shooting panoramas okay, buthonestly it is wide enough to satisfy me. Compared to the camerabright(too small) and litepanels(too expensive( this is a very good value. It is very light and portable. You can replace the batteries if necessary.My final opinion is:as a consumer based light it is wonderful very good for basic needs (casual informal videos)I would recommend this to anyone, because it is a very good value.I may post a y o u tube video. look under sima sl10x review."
1,Sima SL-10LX Universal LED Camcorder Light,Do not buy this LED Camcorder Light. It is not bright enough to record by.
1,Waste Of Money,This light is absolutely useless. I could tell no difference between videoquality when this light was used.
1,"Barely, just BARELY, better than nothing","I paid less than half of the normal price for this light, and that was still too much. The only positive comment I can give it is that it is small and convenient. As far as doing what it is designed for, though, it doesn't really shine, it ""glows."" I suppose during the next power outage I can use it to make my way down the stairs and around my house, but even then I will need to step carefully. It certainly ads little to no value for shooting video. Don't waste your money; try something else."
2,get the SL-20LX instead,"I have a Sima SL-20LX and wanted a second one, so I ordered this. Whoops. This model has 9 LEDs, compared to about 50 for the 20LX, for about the same price."
2,Sima SL-10LX Universal LED Camcorder Light,"You get what you pay for on this item. Kind of cheaply made, range is no more than a couple feet from the camera, hot shoe does not fit correctly."
4,Good For the Price,I bought mine used and i was surprised on how bright it is. This is my first light for my x grip camera holder which is currently shipping with my fish eye i bought and i think it will fit hopefully and fit in for the set up. I would recommend this for some skaters that get followed by a Filmer but i don't think it will do good for setting a camera down and skate at night but that is what construction lights are for.
5,"Sima Light, Slim Compact and Rechargeable Batteries","I have opted to get this because I use two of these mounted together on both sides of my camcorder to be turned on for a wider field of view. They are rechargeable and can use conventional batteries also. The larger model the Slx 20, I didn't know if it would clear my camcorder flip out door. This model the Sl-SLX10 does on my DM accessories multicube Canon mini hot shoe adapter. I wish they would make a taller light bar so it would be 2 or 3 lights wide when mounted sideways on either side of the camcorder. It does exactly what I wanted it too at a Bargain Price compare to Expensive cheaply made Light Panels Micro Lights and others that are big and bulky and overpower your subjects eyes and can't be used with boom mics simultaneously"
4,Sima video light,The light works good but you get only about 30min not an hour as claimed; it works better at close up than at long distance shooting.
2,Not much here....,"I have read a very substantial amount on the hidden reasons behond overweight and this book just doesn't have much useful information. The author constant repeating of how most of our weight problems stem from things that were told and done to us before the age of 3 just isn't backed up by anything. It doesn't make any sense. Our beliefs, self-talk and attitude are infused over the years, MANY things contribute to it. Not just the 1st 3 years."
2,Rosalie,I was very disappointed with the black and white expensive DVD. I was expecting similar quality to some of the musicals with Nelson Eddie and Jeanette Macdonald. Nelson's voice was great but the combination of tap dancing with only Nelson singing fell flat on its face. I guess we can't always give rave reviews. Eleanor is a fine tap dancer but her interaction with Nelson left a lot to be desired.
2,souci,HelloThere is a problem on this dvdIt stopped after 20 minutesCan you send me an other one pleaseThanks so muchERIC WAROUX8 IMPASSE DE LA CROIX17390 LA TREMBLADEFRANCE
2,Heavy Scent,"The gel pack is easy, but the lemon scent is WAY too strong, it flavors the water from glasses that have been washed with this soap. I won't use it again. It smells good when the washing machine is running, but it lingers on the dishes."
1,didn't dissolve,We used the gelpacks a few times & they never completely dissolved in the dispenser - just turned into a gooey mess. We use the tablets with the 'powerball' & are pleased with them.
2,Thought it was unnecessary for my needs,My sister-in-law convinced me that this was really good stuff. But I prefer to use the powder dishwasher detergents as I can change the amount that I need depending on how dirty the dishes are.
1,How Many?,"I'm interested in this product but it looks like one small box that I have in my cupboard. It is same color,etc.Is it ONE small box or what is the volume you are selling in this offer?"
4,great value w/ coupon,"The Italian made very soft fabric is 10% cashmere, 20% nylon, and 70% lambswool. I ordered a size petite 8 and it is larger than I expected, but perfect with a sweater underneath. Although lacking in some detail, no buttons on cuff,etc. and I didn't care for the faux satin lining, it is well constructed and looks considerably more expensive than a $79 coat. I needed a dress coat that I didn't care if it was given rough wear for my work environment and this fits the bill perfectly."
3,An Engaging Book,"I read this book when it was first published, and I didn't post a review then, but I feel compelled to do so now, in response to the negative review from May 2, 2006.Yes, okay, this isn't a great book. It's very much an ""as told to"" kind of effort. But it isn't a bad read, and I didn't get the sense at all that the O'Connors are talking down to the reader. Just the opposite, in fact. Perhaps it depends on where you're coming from. I still consider myself something of a new rider (I started in my 40s), and I get a lot of inspiration from the O'Connors. Maybe if you're a three- or four-star eventer, you'll find this book a yawn, but I thought it was interesting, and I knew quite a bit about the O'Connors before I bought it. So there!Happy reading--and riding!"
3,Book Worth Reading,"I went into this book with Mary's May 2nd review on my mind. While I can see her point, I was able to get past the holier than thou/humble part. This might be due to the fact that I was expecting it?? Anyway, I loved the book. Besides being an interesting read (and getting to ride all the fences and meet the who's who of the horse world through the O'Connors),It comforted me in the fact that I am not the only one who has experienced catasrophies in the horse world. I am grateful that the O'Connors shared the good stories along with the bad, and I am positive that their heart was in the right place in trying to share their experiences with the rest of us. They have truly earned their place in the horse world. Buy the book."
3,"Whistle great, Title misleading","The whistle itself works well and feels sturdy. The tunes in the book go from Twinkle Twinkle to Yankee Doodle with a mix of some Irish, English, and French tunes. Buy this for the whistle, not for the book."
4,This is HORROR?,"This book is not horror, but it's a great suspense thriller. The fact that other reviewers have discribed it as horror confuses me, because a snake in a bed isn't really horror. It's scary, but not horror scary. Anyway, enough of picking it apart, this is a book that makes you want to read on, to find out what happens next. The person who is playing the tricks is NOT who you think it is, and there is no way of guessing that it really is him/her.A good book for thriller or horror readers, but it isn't proper horror."
3,It was mysterious yet kinda strange and frightening!,This book is about some young adults who used to go to camp silverlake as kids.now as adults they have to face the horror that happened a few years back of a young child who died at age seven. Can they face a horror game that somebody who wants revenge is playing with them? Read and find out.
5,A Very Handy Guide,"A nicely structured book which makes it easy to get around. Each ""style"" of Nymph, Dry or Wet fly has a featured pattern with some background and comments on materials, plus crisp colour tying shots & the recipes for 6 variants of the style. In addition there are Fishing Notes for each style of fly and I found these particularly helpful. I also liked Daves ability to convey concepts. For instance, in describing nymphing a river, he suggests thinking of it in terms of "" ... using the nymph to paint parallel brush strokes on the bottom of the river."" Altogether, a highly recommended book for a fly tyers reference library."
3,Slightly disappointing.,"There was a good bit of useful information here, and more than a few helpful hints. Perhaps I simply expected too much, but I can only say that I do not feel significantly more prepared to write a novel now than I did before reading this book, and that was not the result I was expecting.More useful, I think, for the journeyman writer with some experience under his/her belt who needs tips on how to improve, than for the beginner who has yet to complete a manuscript."
5,How to get started,"I tried to read this before writing anything and I didn't get much out of it. ""Immediate Fiction"" was a help with my lack of self confidence. Now, having been working on my book awhile I have picked Sol Stein up again and it's much more useful to me now, because I recognise my writing problems."
5,Author: Moral Hazard,"Sol Stein offers a common sense approach to writing in ""How to Grow a Novel"". It's the basics that many writers (or editors ?)seem to have forgotten these days. A must read book. I plan to read his book, ""Stein on Writing"" next."
1,Rip-off sequel to an excellent book,"Stein's previous book, ""On Writing"", is excellent, full of insights and practical advice. I often refer to it. In this book, however, the author tries to avoid repeating what is in ""On Writing"", and as a result appears to have simply compiled material that was so vague and unhelpful that it didn't make it into the first book."
5,A great book but sometimes it feels a bit self promoting...,"I have never readStein on Writingthough I intend to after reading this. This book inspired me in a way few other books on writing have. My only problem is the continued references to his own works (not only Stein on Writing, but also his computer program and of course his fiction works and books his company published). This book has enough great information for it to stand on its own for me, but it was frustrating to be repeatedly referred to his other works."
2,a mixed bag,"Bottom line: better get Stein's other book.This one is long on personal stories and short on advice. Do we really need to hear all about Stein's experience with Jimmy Hoffa just to learn that a book written in voice is more lively than one written in impersonal prose? Anyone who has reached the level that they are considering reading this book probably knows that already. In any case, what is needed is HOW to write in a voice, not the vanilla advice to do so.Of course, if you have plenty of money and plenty of time, there are probably a few tidbits in this book that may be new to you. And if you are a beginner, you'll of course benefit from hearing the ABCs expounded by this confident pro."
1,Worthless,"This book was nothing but a platform for the author to talk about how great he is. If you need a book with good writing advice, don't waste your time with this one. The usefull information could be summed up in two pages."
5,Great Writing Resource,"After looking at books on the library shelf, I decided this book best suited my needs, along with Stein's other book, Stein On Writing. I highly recommend it as a resource for novel writers."
4,Skinhead,Real skinhead music for real skinheads. Instrumentals that groove. Most of these tracks are rarely on any other albums. (Not to be confused with those slave white supremest fools). Buy It cheap folks dont get scammed by these inflated prices on reggae music.
2,Wake me when it's over.,"A woman who is having an affair while married to an older man is depressed and suicidal. This is a film that I found dull and not very compelling, to the extent that I slept through some of it. Rachel Weisz is one of the best actresses in Hollywood, but is unable to inject much life into a movie that lacks any interesting drama. This was not a bad film, just one that failed to hold my attention, and is not the most stimulating way to spend your time. Look elsewhere for entertainment."
1,Disappointed that there weren't any sharks,"""Where were the sharks?"" I was lead to believe that ""The Deep Blue Sea"" was a thrilling science fiction film about smart sharks killing people. You see, my friends kept referencing a certain scene involving Samuel L. Jackson being eaten by said shark so many times that I decided to purchase the film to see what the fuss was about. So the day came and ""The Deep Blue Sea"" finally arrived. I was excited, like kid on Christmas morning excited. After tearing through the packaging, I popped the DVD into my Xbox 360 and gave it my full attention. What I watched was no shark story, but a love story. It was great and all, but there weren't any sharks. No action. No Samuel L. Jackson. My friends had deceived me. But they have deceived me for the last time. This I can guarantee you....."
1,The Deep Blue Sea? (it is not),"We were disappointed. It was way to slow... and finally to end it all, unworthy of the time spent waiting...."
3,OK movie,"I bought this movie for my daughter who loves the main actor. It was OK, but I had to watch it in two sittings because it was basically a study into this womans clinical depression which is well...... depressing. After an hour of her looking through a window and contiplating- whatever- I had to go do something else and finish it later."
2,movie,This movie just did not make it for me. It was interesting how it was made like an old movie but the plot just trudged along for me and did not really hold my interest well.
3,Okay Movie and Okay Quality,It's nice to experience a movie right as you buy it but the quality of the image was bad. The movie itself was a continual down ward spiral but it did spark some points with me that I hadn't had before. It was a good experience but I wish that the movie would have been of better quality (visually).
4,Never meant to be,"The movie is a great representation of the battle we fight between a stable relationship and the passion that comes from something forbidden. Although it felt like there were steps missing, the actors all portrayed their characters quite well. The focus is on the woman and seems to be ""told"" from her perspective. It's sad because the truth of the film hits quite close to home."
2,Depressing,"Although with any affair, you don't expect rosy outcomes, but there is also more romance. The chemisty I felt was terribly lacking.I watched it to see Rachel Weisz's performance which although great didn't detract from how disjointed the story was told.I suppose the continuous ""flashbacks"" and learning why this is the end seem to leave me cold. I don't have any feeling or understanding for any of the characters."
2,The deep blue depression,"Watching this film was not enjoyable. The three principal characters, a frustrated, unfulfilled younger wife, her lover, and her older fully aware husband are a study in selfish, immature and ultimately uninteresting behavior. She acts as though the age difference with and her husband were his fault and that she is entitled to a young, more virile bedmate. The lover in question is a former flyer in the WW II British airforce, who cannot seem to understand that the war is over and he is not a hero, and her older, weak-willed husband allows the two of them to walk all over him. The only person of interest comes with a too brief appearance of the husband's ""dragon lady"" mother.Spend your money and time elsewhere."
1,Please read this before watching,"I found this film self indulgent and painfully dull. From the start I was massively irritated by the jarring, screeching violin score. This went on for so long that I genuinely thought that there wasn't going to be any dialogue, just a succession of flashbacks with that terrible music laid over the top.Finally, the music abated and led into an hour and a half of complete misery with iceberg slow, laborious cinematography. This would include in the main part the Rachel Weisz being filmed sitting or standing in a drab 1950's bedsit, usually smoking and looking thoughtfully into space/out the window. The rest of the film is filled with people in the depths of despair all for their own various reasons.When the movie ends it's a relief."
1,Muy aburrida,"Un film falto de acción, más aburrida parece imposible. La actriz protagonista no parecia creerse el papel. La banda sonora parecia de una banda desafinada. El actor protagonista, ausente todo el rato y el pobre marido, ni sabia dar pena. Cuesta hacerlo peor. Muy aburrida."
2,Insipid characters. Not even Rachael and Tom could save this.,"You would think a story about sexual repression and forbidden love would be juicy but this film is lacking in so many ways. Simply put the characterization is flat and I could not bring myself to care about such selfish insipid people and their struggles. There is no great seduction, it is laughably anticlimactic. Hester is not someone you sympathize with, you want to smack her. Freddie is just as bad, and both are immature prats. The pacing is off as well, the payout of their sexual tension comes too soon, and the use of flashbacks is confusing and jars an already awkward movie.Watch if if you want to see Tom and Rachael naked. Then turn if off and spare yourself the remaining 2 hours.I would have given it 1 star, but a naked Tom Hiddleston is worth at least one."
2,I had high hopes,"I enjoy British films, especially with these stars, however, the film felt disjointed, verrrrrry slooooow and it was difficult to maintain my interest even though I watched it all the way through."
2,Did not enjoy,Although the critics liked this movie I found it boring and over acted. The music was so over bearing it distracted from the actors lines..
2,Deep Blue Sea,"I like the actors in these story,,but that is about it. The story is very slooooow. It moves at a snails pace and flips back and forth. I stayed with it, just to get to the end, so I could figure it all out, in hopes of the story redems itself. The acting is good..the story is like watching paint dry."
1,borring!,"Slow and pointless. I could not sit still and watch it. It took me three days. I paid for it, so I had to Finnish it but it was torture."
2,Depressing,"I tried to get it - I did. I watched it till the end, but what a depressing, depressing movie. Good acting, yes. Needy woman hooks up with maybe younger man. She leaves secure, loveless relationship with an older gentleman for a more exciting one with a poor, younger adventurer. Not surprinsingly, he new beau leaves her after he's had enough of her. But I'm stunned that she is so needy. I almost want to call her a ""loser."" She disgusts me. Her lover does also, in the end. They're really both the same - emotionally deficient."
5,It's a very beautiful movie,"I bought this product because Tom Hiddleston, and I like this movie. It's a very beautiful movie, beautiful people, beautiful screen, and the music is good."
1,Read at your own risk!,"This book is not only badly written, it is an example of the dangers of cult-recruiting preying on those who may be young, lost, and searching. Since this edition predicts that the world as we know it will end in May 2001, it will be interesting to see if a new edition comes out which moves the day of doom ahead so that this cult guru can continue to collect on other people's hard-earned income.Even just as an intellectual exercise, this book holds no value. The storyline is choppy and holds no continuity. The author goes in and out of predicting the future and self-glorification. Save your money."
4,Better Mad About You,"The rendition of Mad About You on this CD is better than the original by Belinda Carlisle. The lead singer on this track has voice tones more appealing than the rapid vibrato of Belinda. I like Belinda, but this woman has tones that keep me coming back. The CD is by the Countdown Singers.. and most tracks are so-so. But Mad About You is special. I bought the CD just to get the one track."
5,Divine Shakti!,"Purchase this yantra and the cd ""Soulflight - Chanted Mantras for Healing and Illumination"" by Bhavani Lorraine Nelson. Play track 2, Mahamrtyunjaya Mantra, sit in front of the yantra and chant along. Burn in Ecstasy!"
4,Nice and Quiet,I have had this for quite a while with no problems.....it is as quiet as claimed.....just a tad bit heavy to lug around.
2,Not what I expected...,"It doesn't cover the fridge like in the picture. The cover doesn't fully reach around the fridge most of the time on standard refrigerators and leaves the back exposed. The Velcro straps are a joke, they barely reach each other and always break apart because they are holding on together by a small length. I had to take this to a tailor and alter it so it would actually be useful."
5,I suppose...,"...it works...In order to really see a difference you would have to take it consistently every day, which I don't because I'm forgetful. I personally didn't notice much of a difference, but try it for yourself. It can't hurt."
4,Darthsidious Action Toy,"I just gave this toy to my eight year old grandson, who is recovering from a vius and he loves it! He thinks the ""face changing"" is cool and likes the durability of the lightsaber that he can remove. He has fun with the blue lighting and red ball ejecting them at other Star Wars characters that Darthsidious is fighting. This toy was a big hit!"
2,Not worth $30.00,"This video may have a couple of ideas I have not heard about (there are only a few exercises on the video), but it is not worth $30.00. It looks as if it were filmed 30 years ago and she simply shows you the exercise (doesn't give you time to finish each one) and moves onto the next. She does not discuss breathing--which I feel is essential in abdominal work. I am not happy with this purchase."
1,Not worth the money,"If it were the only on the market, then fine, but generally not worth the money. I much prefer Julie Tupler's book and DVD. Book available through Amazon - Lose your Mummy Tummy; DVD available online through her website Maternal Fitness. Lose your Mummy Tummy does have a bit of an intense tone to it, that you can do without, but taking information and chosen exercises from it (I'm not a die-hard gymnast here and lack time and motivation) is very helpful. I got my diastasis down to something bearable before getting pregnant again, and will do the exercises after this birth."
2,diastasis recti,"Well produced. The concept of healing diastasis recti of long standing in men, by using these maneuvers, seems to me and to my physician, a bit optimistic, however."
3,Dated Yet Worth While,"With a preface which expresses some rather dated views in light of more recent research (i.e. citing Lao Tzu as the founder of Taoism,) as well as some rather dated translation of the original texts(again in light or recent research,) this book is still a worth-while read for scholarly and the curious.The text contains an early translation of the Tao Te Ching originating from a 1891 Oxford text book of the same title, using the Wade-Giles romanization. The commentary is given from a scholarly Christian perspective, but given the book's source, that is to be expected.The texts presented, are the Tao Te Ching, and select writings of Cheng-Tzu. While there are better translations available in this day and age, this is still a useful historical resource for a newcomer to Taoism."
4,smash is a smash!,"This series is a wonderful new addition for TV viewing. It provides wonderful theatrical performances, songs and dance while containing a very, very good story line. Can't wait for the new season! This is a refreshing and much needed TV offering. The only criticism I have is the lack of better volume in the video. The nuiances of the dialogue require intense listening and I just could not adjust in enough volume. Thanks, bab2"
5,Love this showw,My wife watched it last year and I wished I had so we had a Smash marathon and I got caught up. This is a great show although we liked Season 1 much more than Season 2.
5,Smash,"The music is wonderful! Interesting sub plots, love Angelica and the bartender. Im a sucker for musicals,cant wait for season two!!"
3,Sure hope it gets better,"I have been planning on watching this show. After viewing the first episode, I an underwhelmed. The Marilyn musical music is dull. The characters don't seem too interesting. The show needs to get better, fast."
2,Not a fan of faux reality shows.,"I suppose people that like ""Glee"" may like this show. I how every am not a fan at all. After watching the preview I'm left thinking ""so what"". Sorry but it just did not do anything for me. Maybe this is why I don't watch regular TV or cable anymore."
1,Disappointing,"I was really looking forward to watching Smash, so I was doubly disappointed in not liking it. The writing and situations seemed forced to me, like they were either trying too hard or not enough. I also didn't feel anything for the actors themselves. Overall, a let down."
1,Smashingly boring,"Not sure what the hype is about. It's only 1 show in (so far). The first episode was beyond boring. I tried watching the whole thing but the characters seemed very cliched and unoriginal. No one really grabbed my attention. The singing is good, but the somewhere over the rainbow has been heard again and again with katherine mcphee singing it -- again nothing new or original about her rendition. The story line (thus far) seemed contrived and unnatural. Will I be watching another episode? Probably not."
5,"Thank you, producers!","This is the best series ever produced for television: incredible original music, fabulously choreographed dance, wonderfully talented actors and dancers and a terrific story line. I will treasure these dvds forever!"
4,Very entertaining,Wonderful new show with a good story line. I like the way they use both original songs and already popular songs.
5,AMAZING!,I love how with one episode a show like this has got you asking for more! It really is a fantastic ensemble with very talented people from all over. Definitely a must watch. From the perspective of an avid glee fan i can attest to the fact that SMASH is radically different from glee not only in song choices and portrayals but also in direction and development of storyline. AMAZING!
5,Love It!,I love this show and loved being able to watch it again. I highly recommend this show and dvd set to everyone who loves Broadway.
4,Is this really a Suunto MC-2G Global Compass?,"I purchased this compass, but other than the packaging, am unable to find an indicator that it is a MC-2G.I see ""global system"" above the hole in which lanyard loops, but other than that, how can I tell?thx!"
1,It's not like the picture,"I recently bought this compass and I very very dissapointed. In the picture the compass had 2 measures systems, inches and centimeters. And 2 scales. But the compass I receive only have inches and miles!!!! and the only scale is 1:24!!! Not supose to be a ""global system""? In the description not say anything about this."
5,Compass with Everything,This compass is worth every cent. It has smooth movement and every feature that I need to get accurate and precise readings.
4,"Good, reliable compass","Good, strong, well designed compass. It does everything it should do and is easy to read. The literature that came with it could be better."
5,Compass,Compass works great! I like all functions and easy to use. Mirror protects capsule when closed and needle works great even if compass is not perfectly level.
2,Unlikely scale,"I did not purchase this item, nor am I saying anything about the compass part. It is the scale etched into the plastic that made me reject the Suunto compass. If you zoom in on the image you will find a 1 : 25000 scale. However, most USGS topo maps are 1 : 24000 scale. I want to avoid taking a grid reader with me when I go hiking (always take a topo map). A compass with a 24K scale on it would do nicely, but not this compass."
3,Batman and Robin trouble here too!,I have not read the strategy guide but have played the game successfully up to the same point as Hitmanxx7; I am in the tree/hedge maze area and have found the hole to the right of the tree to drop into one of the hidden labs but can't get to the other(s) though I have found access to a hedge covered doorway with bars blocking the way into another lab.
3,batman and robin trouble,listen im haveing trouble on ivy's lab. i cant find her lab. the four rooms r confusing can anybody please email me back with a walkthrough and maybe send a map of it. send to Hitmanxx7@aol.com. tahnk you and someone pleae email me back.
3,Documentary but Lacking,Seems like this film lacks in about every area. It is a documentary and not a good one. Sort of skims the surface in all areas reviewed. The narration is weak at best and there are not enough details to make is historically correct.
4,The Man who can look backwards,This was written in 1969 and for the time was a leading edge book in reincarnation. I met the author in 1969 and had a life reading from him and as I look back on it now...40 years later...it was stunning as it related to the way my life has unfolded.
5,My 15 month old son's 'security',"This is the toy that my son has claimed as his 'security' Although it says to clean with damp cloth, there are times when you just have to throw it in the washing machine. We have done just that and it is still holding up. In fact, we have just purchased our 3rd one because we are washing one just about every night. We want to make sure that we always have a clean one around. We are very satisfied with this product.This is also the 2nd time we have ordered from this seller. The first time was very professional and very prompt, and we are assuming that this time will be the same."
2,Scored single staff,Every score is a single staff melody with a smattering of guitar chords. I was disappointed that it did not include scores for the modern keyboard. Descriptions of sheet music should indicate the arrangement. I gave it two stars for its production value as a book and its interest to singers.
4,Good Kitchen Compost Bucket,This is great to throw your coffe grounds and filters and store it in a kitchen cabinet out of sight.
1,Fine at First...,"Had it for two years and loved it at first. Now, despite constant filter changes, scrubbing with bleach and air/sun dryouts, IT STINKS. Literally, the plastic has absorbed odors which are impossible to eradicate. And don't even get me started about the gnats and fruit flies. I am going to pitch it out and buy a stainless steel kitchen bucket."
3,Plastic tabs snapped,I bought this 8 months ago. It worked quite well until the plastic holding the carbon filter snapped and can't be fixed.
3,It's just okay,"I ordered the large one and it was smaller than I thought it would be. The size is kinda strange - it's too big for a countertop and too short for keeping on the floor (I use it a lot and am so tired of bending to keep compost inside). I also wish I could open it by pressing on some pedal with my foot. Sometimes when I open the lid, the filter falls out. The shape/size does not work well for us - we usually empty compost bin into a big paper bag and only then throw it in the big compost trash bin outside (our county does not allow compostable plastic bags) and it's a pain to empty this one into the paper bag. I don't see anything in the stores that is drastically better, so I will keep it."
4,Holds up well,Have had this bucket for several months. It fills up about once a week or so. I take it down a hill to my compost pile. I have not been gentle with this bucket and it has held up well. My only complaint is the filter holder on top pops off frequently and could snap in a little tighter. But I rarely smell any odors from it.
4,love it,"i like that it was easy to ""assemble"". also, i dont smell anything. not even when im right over the bucket. missed out on 5 stars simply because the lid doesnt seal. i wish it did."
2,Weak lid tabs,"I don't know how the other purchasers did it but I broke one of the lid tabs on the first attempt to put the lid on the bucket. It didn't even bend the slightest bit, it just broke! I realize that this is not that expensive compared to other kitchen compost bins for sale here, and honestly it is not that different from the tuperware we were already using for kitchen scraps, but come on...I was able to make a quick-fix and I guess that will work until we get a better compost bin. However, I do see several open spaces that would allow fruit flies to get in. I will use it for a week and let you know how it works for us."
3,The Kenneth Roberts Reader,"This is a good introduction to Roberts, who remains my favorite novelist of all time. I bought this book to fill in some gaps in my personal Roberts collection. But it doesn't replace the real thing. Roberts' novels have to be read in their entirity; anything else sells the reader short. It is a nice companion to my collection, but should not be considered a stand-alone representation of the man who gave us such gripping novels as ""Rabble in Arms"" and ""Northwest Passage."""
5,Excellent Book,This is a wonderful synopsis of behaviors that I didn't know existed. It is well written with great pictures showing the enormous amount of time underwater that it must have taken to compile them. It has made me look at the reef in a whole new way.
5,Probably the best book available on this topic.,"If you are hesitating due to the price of this book don't. Check out the contents page on the 'look inside' facility above. It is well worth the expense. Excellent photos,( I wonder how many hours underwater they spent observing the behaviour captured in these pics?) highly informative text, an absolute mine of interesting facts and observations about a complex subject. Though specific to the Caribbean and Bahamas it can also be used by divers in the Pacific and Indian oceans. Obviously it does not cover all species and unfortunately misses out on some of my personal favourites Morays, Lionfish, Boxfishes, Porcupinefishes and Puffers but at 360 pages it still covers a lot of ground. Enjoy!"
4,Great Complement..,Very informative and a complement to the Reef Set. This gives some good explanation to behavior we often see within the aquatic environments.
4,Great Book,"I love this book. I have been working with Feng Shui and did not venture into Vastu Shastra because of it's complexity. But this book really simplifies the ancient art of Vastu Shastra by describing how to create altars. It has great pictures,tables and the language is quite simple. I have already created two altars and can see the results. Good luck"
5,Musica per ricordare,"E' la prima volta che mi capita di acquistare un disco tanto bello ad un prezzo così basso.Tutti i brani creano un'atmosfera sognante che conferisce alla musica una straordinaria azione rilassante.E' facile, allora, abbondonarsi sull'onda dei ricordi e ripercorrere sognando tempi lontani che, purtroppo, non ritorneranno mai più.Alessandro Bella"
5,infinitys,these speakers hit hard. the tweeters are clean and the roll over surround allows for that better excursup close they look really fragile though
4,good mystery...compelling characters,it was a very good read. Kept my attention and there were some good plot twists in it that were not obvious. Will read more of her work
4,WOW,I chose this book because it sounded interesting and it was free! What a great happenstance! I was hooked right away. The characters drew me in and I had to know what happened.The twists in the story kept me guessing. This book is a rollercoaster ride.........and worth every bit of it!
5,good read,I got this book because it was free and then ended up buying the rest of the series. I enjoyed the characters and the author's style of writing.
3,"Has potential, but needs a sensible editor","As a former Literature and Composition teacher, I found the myriad grammar and spelling mistakes annoying, but the general plot development was not bad at all. And I was spared the F-bomb (four times in the first couple of pages, as described by another reviewer), as the edition I received had them edited out with the thinly-veiled word ""friggin'"" ... not hard to figure out what was originally published. However, while the frequent use of the term may be 'hip', it is certainly unnecessary in most contexts. Beyond these annoyances, the author has created a good, solid story with interesting twists and intriguing puzzles for the reader's mind. I looked forward to each new chapter.Methinks many of the free or inexpensive books offered to Kindle readers are self-published, so one has to look beyond the obvious mistakes to find the essence of the story and its message. This author has great potential if she finds a sensitive and sensible editor."
4,Hostile Witness,Very good thriller. Held my attention all the way to the end and then let me know I'm not the detective I thought I was. Can't wait for more in the series.
4,Crikey - this was this good and it was FREE!,I'm only part way in - but I love this lady's writing style and can't believe it was a freebie! I've paid $15 for other books by well known writers and they have not been such a good read. The only reason I haven't given you five stars is because I haven't finished it yet... Go girl and thanks!
4,Easy read,"Good book, I will read others from Rebecca Forster. Good plot it took me a few chapters to get the flow of the book but worth it."
2,Hostile Witness,"Too long and talky. Lack of suspense. Too much legalese. Can't compare at all to ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo."
3,A bit dissapointing,"Having read legal thrillers written by Michael Connelly, Randy Singer, John Grisham etc. and seeing all there 5 and 4 star reviews I expected something better. Although I found this book excellent to read in bed before turning off the light - each night it beautifully helped me become sleepy ;))"
2,A disappointment,I think the writer was more concerned with producing a book with lots of pages instead of quality. There were certain parts of the book that was just painful to read (especially the scene with Miggy).Could have been a good book if it wasn't for all the dribble.
3,Good story but needs editing,"The plot was interesting and the book was a quick and entertaining read. The only thing slowing it down was all the grammatical and spelling errors. At least get a friend to read and correct the Kindle version, PLEASE."
4,Hostile Witness,"I enjoyed Hostile Witness. It was well written, fast moving and keeps you guessing throughout. I recommend this book for a casual quick read."
2,At Least It Was Free,"This was hard to get through, even with it being in the ""mystery/thriller"" category. In fact, I'm surprised I did finally finish reading it all. It took several tries. At least it was free to download onto my Kindle."
4,"Slow start, thrilling middle, predictable ending","This novel started kind of in the thick of things, which is usually an approach I favor, however it didn't actually feel as though it was in the thick of things for a couple of chapters. Once it got settled, I was enthralled and read almost through the night to completion. My biggest disappointment lies with the ending. I knew the answer to the 'whodunit' forEVER and found myself frustrated that the main character had not once allowed her suspicions to head that route. Overall, still a decent read. I will definitely be checking out the other 'Josie Baylor Bates' novels."
3,It was okay.,"This book was okay. I was interested enough to finish the book but was annoyed with the main character most of the time. Resultingly, I did not enjoy it enough to buy another book by this author."
1,Couldn't make myself finish.....,"I started the book and couldn't believe how the story was developing .. the unrealistic jail scene with a 16 year girl in general population. Was this just so the author could write the requisite voyeur scenes? Plot was weak, characters thinly written and the prose failed to make me want to keep reading.Several pages in I just couldn't believe how bad it was ...."
3,Hostile witness,Great read!couldn't put my kindle down and looking forward to reading my next Josie Bates book ! I give this book five stars.
4,Good!,Good read! Very enlightening. I enjoyed reading up on this book. It was very thrilling. I would reccommend anyone to read this book.
4,Hostile witness,I enjoyed the book because it was a relaxing read. Perfect for a holiday. Not too mind-boggling but keeps your attention
5,Excellent!,"This book held my attention (a feat in itself) from start to finish. From beginning to end, it is excellently written. I want to read more by this author."
3,Ok legal thriller,"Really not the best legal thriller ive read. Pretty medium overall, though enjoyable and worth the $0 i spent for the free kindle edition. If you want a free kindle read, its worth the time."
3,The author has potential,"I just finished ""skim reading"" this book. It had potential and was good at times but not so good at others. I was pretty sure I knew who was guilty rather early on in the book and ended up skimming ahead to find out if I was correct, I was. I didn't care about what happened in between. This book didn't 'pull me in' like a good thriller should, but I do think Rebecca Forester has potential."
3,Ok legal thriller,"Josie Bates is an intense lawyer who you learn to like early on, with some reservations. She's stubborn and flawed in ways that are brought out in long flashback scenes with her abusive mother (some of which I could have lived without). She makes some flat-out dumb choices as the plot develops, which kept me from identifying with her the way I like to with the lead character.The plot revolves around her defense of an old college friend's daughter for murder, who Josie identifies with because of what we learn about her own troubled past. It gets to be too much character development and not enough plot. In the end, the book redeems itself with some very good courtroom drama, well told. All in all, it's ok, and worth reading."
3,"GOOD, BUT PREDICTABLE","The book was good, but somewhat predictable. Enjoyed the courtroom banter, but kept reading mostly because I was sick in bed for New Years, and made a New Years resolution to finish what I start...."
3,O.K.,This mystery had me right up til the end. I thought that the ending was a little weak because I guess I was expecting more.
3,"A Good, Solid Thriller","I found this legal thriller the type of book I just burned through as I became driven to find the TRUTH along with attorney Josie Baylor-Bates. And, like a lot of contemporary mysteries I have read lately, I can see how this story and pacing could be easily adapted to a good mainstream movie.At the same time, I found the topic somewhat difficult as it dealt with a highly dysfunctional mother-daughter relationship and terrifying yet plausible descriptions of abuse.This was a recommendation by my husband, who had downloaded it for our Kindle and read it himself. I am not sure I would have picked it for myself had I read the synopsis on first. All in all, though, I would not say I wasted my time."
2,dragged out,"When I started this book, I was apprehensive about it. It began ok but as I continued, I found it skipped around too much & added too many unimportant facts. I hoped it would improve as I got closer to the end but it didn't."
2,Ok,"I found this to be a slow read and somewhat predictable. The twist was not all that surprising. I didn't really feel anything for the main characters, but I liked Archer, a secondary character. I may read the next book in the series because he is the main character."
4,Nice twists,"I liked the book and was so caught up in it, I lost all track of time. Stayed up all night to finish it."
4,captivating,"this is a well written book it keeps the reader involved and wanting to where it's going next. It is suspenseful and entertaining, well laid out and enjoyable reading."
3,Hostile witness,this was the first book i bought for Kindle and i enjoyed it but it was a little slow. Took a while too get in to the book
4,would read more,"This was the first book I read on kindle, and also the first legal thriller I have read. Thoroughly enjoyable book. And I would look to read more books by this Author."
3,book,"good suspense novel, although it didn't make me want to read more books from this author. I may look but it was so-so."
4,Average,"Not terrible but not great. This book was predictable in may areas and the typical Lawyer working for the poor, living on the beach with a cute dog and perfect boyfriend."
4,Really makes you see how children love regardless,It was a good story. I Hope there is a sequel. I want to know where she goes from here.
4,Riveting book.,"I had a hard time putting this one down. The plot twists are unexpected. It's a little hard on politicians, and I like that. I like the dog as well."
3,Hostile Witness,"The story was a not too believable, but it was a fun read anyway. The characters did not have much depth."
5,I'll read all her books,"Haven't read a legal thriller for a long time, because I didn't know of a good writer for this genre of books. The book was very interesting from page 1. Full of turn around events and surprises, very good book. I now have a new writer to add in my collection of the best books to buy and will be reading all her book.Congratulation Rebecca."
3,a decent read,"yes, a decent read. i am glad that i happened upon it while scrolling. the story moved along at a good clip and had a few twists to keep me involved. i enjoyed the use of quotes at the start of each chapter. the use/integration of more than a few characters left me hanging at numerous points but i was able to move past and continuing reading. some of the language was unbelievable (do people in major metro areas even say ""half-breed"" these days?? c'mon son...) and i. recommend that you quickly move past those sections. the major complaint i have is the depiction/implication of Black men as domestic batterers (wow, did i just make up a word there? ugh...) and druggie criminals. *shrug* guess some may say there is no room for that complaint given who the villian turns out to be. oh! reading descriptions of socal places where I've lived and enjoyed was one of the main reasons i finished reading it. hopefully you can pick this up at the same price that i did and enjoy it too."
4,Decent mystery,"Keeps you guessing well into the story. Has just enough 'sex' to be believable and doesn't fill pages with hard-to-believe escapes from bad guys. It is an interesting, semi - cerebral whodunit!"
3,No surprise ending here,"If you like surprise endings, this book isn't for you. I read it through hoping I was wrong, but sadly, I wasn't."
3,Didn't grab me until I was half way thru it.,The second part of the book was a grabber but I predicted the ending. All in all a pretty good read.
3,Hostile witness,"Got this one as a free book on Kindle. Although it was an emotional ride, it was s bit too much. There were more than a few chapters that could have been condensed. Things seemed to have dragged out a lot longer than they needed to be. Wouldn't actually call this one a legal thriller."
3,Hostile Witness,I finished the book but I found that I was bored through some parts of the story line. There was too much emphasis on one particular character and quite honestly I just got fed up of reading about her physically again and again. Not a bad read if you have nothing else to read.
3,Many murders.,I enjoyed the first three quarters of this book but I felt that the ending was contrived and not up to the rest of the story.
4,A good read,"I wasn't sure that a free book for kindle would be any good so tried this one to check it out. It's a well written and enjoyable novel, recommended!"
4,Hostile witness,I thorougly enjoyed this Ebook. It's the first book I purchased for my new Kindle. It was well written and I am now reading another book by the same author. Hostile Witness is the first book in The Witness Series. I will purchase the second book in that series as soon as I finish reading my last purchase. I'm excited to start on the second one.
4,Witness Series,Great read - I can't wait to read the other 3! Got the first one for free and the other ones were reasonably priced.
3,Sloppy writing,"The story is adequately entertaiing, but predictable.The grammar and punctuation are atrocious.Would it have killed them to run this by a copy editor?"
4,Enjoyed,"Hostile Witness (book one) was thoroughly enjoyedable, it keeps you wanting to continue reading, looking forward to reading the second book in the series."
3,not bad - forced story,"Overall I liked the writing. If an authors writing doesn't grab me right away then I usually won't continue with a book.The author grabbed my attention and kept me with the story.The reason for a three star, the story just seemed forced. Someone else said unplausible, have to agree.Entertaining read though and for some they story may do more for you."
4,Hostile Witness - Holds your attention,"There's not only a murder, but there is also a lot of suspects each with convincing motives. The story moves along quite well. It's an easy read and holds your attention by delving into each suspects' background."
4,AS GOOD AS GRISHAM OR TUROW,"This was an intricate legal ""thriller.""You did care about the main characters and couldn't guess the ending.It's a fine book for free! I may go on to buy others from this author- isn't that the point?"
4,Fascinating thriller,This book was one that kept me interested throughout. It moves along quickly and I had trouble putting it down. There are some unusual twists to the story that kept me guessing for a while. I plan to read more of Rebecca Forsters work when I can.
4,"Quick, good read.","This book was a quick read. Captivating from the start, it remained interesting to the end. I would definitely read more by this author."
4,Decent Legal Thriller,"What I didn't like:The protagonist is so driven to save her client that she drives everyone else away. There are not a lot of likeable people in this book. I wish the hero had been more likeable.What I liked:The story is gripping, especially once the trial starts. There's enough action to keep the story moving at just the right pace. The plot unfolds nicely and the characters are well-developed. The climax is a real page-turner and the ending is satisfying.I'm glad I read this book. I really like the genre and there don't seem to be a lot of books like this around."
3,This book kept my interest.,"Hostile Witness by Rebecca Forster. I enjoyed this book, but it was a little too psychological for me. Well written."
3,Mystery?,This was a little more confusing but still a good book.not sure how the characters came together.Will read another by the author and see how it goes.
3,Hostile witness,"Easy and quick read, but a bit predictable. Should have elaborated more on the old guy that was killed and his relationship with family."
5,AWESOME,Loved it all. Would recommend this to everyone. Couldn't put it down from beginning to end. Read this book now
3,Very good,I really want to read more of her books hopefully in the order they were written. This book held my interest and kept me guessing until the end. Love legal thrillers!
5,Hostile witness,"This book is amazing, based upon its topic of a mystery willing to be shared with others all around. -great book"
3,Hostile Witness by Rebecca Forster,Nice holiday reading material. I enjoyed it. Have not read a thriller in a long time. Will definitely try more of author's books.
3,Not quite my style,"Not a bad read which I did enjoy overall. However, the characters did not always ring true or logically. I wondered at times why a character did or said what they did as it just did not make sense. There was a lot of courtroom dialogue which I find tedious but then my fault for choosing such a book."
3,Overview,"An interesting story, but the presentation of characters left the reader with some catching-up to do. I would have liked to have each character better and more completely introduced when they appear in the book and not find important details later. Worth reading. I will read other books in the series and see how the author develops. I appreciate the variety of subjects and authors Amazon makes available."
4,Started out a little slow for me but then I couldn't put it down...,"Once I got into this thriller, it was difficult to put down. I enjoyed the characters and the story. For a ""freebie"" I really liked this book and now I am interested in the rest of her series. I did see several areas that could use some editing, spelling corrections but I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a mystery thriller."
3,Good time waster,"I downloaded this free, and was pleasantly surprised. The main characters where OK and the plot was stung along well enough to make me want to finish the book. It isn't particularly a genre I read but if the authors other books series are free I'll read them. Decent but not great. I don't want to post spoilers as to specific criticism but will in replies if anyone really cares."
4,"Wow...Rebecca Forster, you're good!","Initially bought the book to give it a try because the price was right. I'm a thriller buff - found I really like Forster's style. Quickly bought the rest of the books in the series. Though her books are not filled with gory murder details, she has a way of describing the characters that makes you want to read more. Can't go wrong."
4,Hostile Witness,Hostile Witness is a great triller easy to read and keeps you in suspence I gave it four stars great book
4,Hostile Witness,"The story is good. Sometimes the dialogue gets a bit much, especially when characters argue. They go on and on and keep saying the same things."
3,Good overall,"""Her hands trembled and her stomach turned with a sudden sickness. Bad times were coming. The landlord was there, and the rent was due...."" There were many lines in the story like this one, but this caught my eye; a metaphor that is somewhat funny actually, comparing imminent danger to overdue rent??The repulsively selfish characterization of the mother got into me. She's got a mind so twisted that she witnessed against her daughter for a crime she herself committed.It was a good read overall. This is only the first in the series, and I got this for free....I know the next installments wouldn't be free but if the price is right, I'll delve on the next books. I'm not in a hurry, though.flag"
4,Hostile Witness Series #1,First time I read this author and am glad I tried her. Book was quite good and a quick read. Would definitely look at the rest of the series
4,"Easy read, liked the story line","The storyline was entertaining, but the characters were shallow... even so, it was a good read and one I would recommend"
4,well written. good soryline.,fast paced. decent characters. it kept me wanting to know what happened. i look forword to her next book in the series.
4,Great read!,"Though I really enjoyed this book, it started out slow and took me sometime get into it. I must admit, that I was disappointed at how Josie was described as a strong woman that could hold her own, but yet she seemed to shrink away from Linda and couldn't stand up to her or even protect herself in the end."
4,Hostile Witness,This book caught my attention right in the very beginning and held to the very end. The characters developed into very real people and you felt their emotions as they roller coastered through the plot. I enjoyed this book so much that I purchased the rest of the series.
4,Satisfying Read,"I like this story. Characters are mostly well thought out, especially Josie. I would have liked a definition of what a ""hostile witness"" actually is, because I am not entirely sure I understand that term, but I can find out another way. The pieces fit together well and I was left satisfied at the end. I'm hoping to read more in the Josie series."
4,excellent first read new author for me,I enjoyed this book on my Kindle. The characters and plot were compelling and I have already moved on to book #2
3,3.5 Stars,"I liked this book, but had trouble with some of the typos and editing errors. I would have given this 4 stars if not for that. I liked how many of the characters had flaws and were not always doing the correct thing. The bottom line, this was a potentially very good book, just needs some editing."
1,waste of time,"three words, a waste of time, the bottom number on my book list, and I would not recommend this to anyone"
1,Ridiculous,"Enough to drive a lawyer bananas. If you're going to write about a trial, you should attempt to be knowledgable about the rules of court. Maybe I missed it, but was Hannah African American? I don't recall any mention of ethnicity until the end when her skin was described as the color of milk chocolate."
2,Slow and boring,I did not like this book as the writing was so boring - The author used names of the characters over and over in the same sentence instead of he or she - it became a drag just to get to the end of the book - The subject matter was interesting but the presentation was weak -
2,Hostle Witness,"I found the story line interesting, but I did not finish the book. I found the use of vulgarity offensive, and I personally choose not to read a book where the author has to use vulgar language to convey her/his thoughts.I would not recommned this book for this reason."
4,Hostile Witness,"I enjoyed this one...first one by this author, now reading the next. It's a good read so far. I'll keep reading ."
4,Feisty female attorney,"Looking for an attorney character who goes out on a limb for her client? Meet Josie Baylor-Bates, who never gives up! Hostile Witness is also a good look at some interesting step-family dynamics.No spoilers here, but give this fiction slack for the apparent lack of police work involved in a prominent Supreme Court Justice's death and the female attorney carrying the load. Hey, that's why it's called fiction! Enjoy the read."
3,Not really a legal thriller.,"My definition of a legal thriller is that a good proportion of the book would be geared towards the courtroom drama, the legal arguments of both sides, the legal process, etc. This book could not really be called a legal thriller, and as such was a disappointment, but as a ""freebie"" and considering the load of rubbish that is offered free on Amazon, the book was readable, but did have numerous grammatical errors and misspellings."
3,Hostile witness,A good read. Very emotional. Some people can relate to the mother daughter relationship. Gave only 3stars because at points it skipped too far ahead.
3,Hostile witness,Well written. Lots of suspects and motives. Josie and Archer make a charming couple. Very entertaining with good use of law.
4,Good story.,"Lots of good court room talk surrounded by a good ""who dun it"" which wasn't readily clear until it was revealed at the end of the story."
4,Hostile Witness,"I enjoyed this book very much. There was one character I didn't really care for, and not just because she was mean. There just seemed to be something not quite right about her character. Other than that minor issue, I thought the other characters were great and well developed. Plenty of twists and turns kept me guessing along the way and I thought everything wrapped up nicely at the end. Wonderful book. Thank you Ms. Forster!"
1,"Poorly written,,",this book is a cliche. The story line sounds interesting but it is poorly written with corny descriptions. I could not read this book.
2,Sorry... I did not like this one...,"I did not enjoy this book at all. I did not like the characters, the plot was weak, really lame legal defense. Did not like it very much at all. I have read so many great books and I can not recommend this one."
5,had everything that makes a good thriller,"Book moved at a fast clip, interesting characters and many twists. The author developed her characters and made them interesting. Loved this book!"
3,Very strange story.,"Not sure if I would read this again, but did finish it. It has been a while since I read it so I don't remember much about it."
3,Hostile witness,Enjoyed reading this book even though I had the mystery solved right away in the beginning of the book. Still good.
4,Hostile Witness,This book is a good read for someone who loves suspense novels. It has a lot of twists and turns that keep you guessing and hooked until the end.
1,Free book - Priced right,"Sadly, very unrealistic. As a former (civil) trial lawyer myself, I expected better research into the trial process and what passes for evidence. Very disappointing when a book is called a ""legal thriller"" but lacks basic insight into courtroom procedure."
1,Tedious beyond belief,"Only good thing to be said about this book was that it was a freebie on Kindle. At least I didn't waste good money on this garbage.If the really impossible plot, hackneyed and over-stereotyped characters weren't enough, the book is replete with typos and grammatical errors that make me conclude the author is either illiterate or so eager to crank out an immediate hit in no speed whatsoever that she never bothers to edit beyond the first draft stage.When I see a courtroom quote like ""Yes, you're honor"" I begin to have serious doubts.Don't bother wasting neuron cycles on this trash."
1,Turned off early,"I was turned off early on in this book by the description of a 16 year old in jail after being arrested. First of all, they wouldn't put a 16 year old in gen pop after an arrest -- she would be in a juvenile facility or remanded to a parent. Secondly, the description of the removal of a white lace thong was gratuitous. Seriously? A 16 year old wearing a white lace thong? I skimmed some more and was totally turned off by the ongoing stereotypes. I stopped reading about a quarter of the way in."
1,Stopped reading,I know a few authors so my review is a meant as positive recommendation to Ms Forster in the hope that she can improve her craft. The story reads like it is aimed at teenagers and the plot is quite simplistic for this genre and very cliched. Character development is off the mark for a story like this and the writing and grammar needs attention also. This might appeal to some (as we can see by the positive reviews) but I couldn't get past about the first 20 pages. Sorry.
4,Good writing and plot--offended by language,"While I enjoyed the book and I would even like to read further installments, I choose not to because of the offensive language. I realize most people would not be offended but I was and most of my family and friends would also, so it is not just a personal thing."
4,Good read,Good characters and a fun read. I recommend to anyone who likes legal thrillers! A very pleasant way to spend an evening.
5,Airport Savings,"A book downloaded while waiting on a plane, and no cost like the stores in the airport. You never know when amazon will be there for you, to assist,to save money."
3,This is a really good novel,"This story kept me reading until the wee hours. It is interesting and fully researched. Some of the characters are not so believable, but I can live with that because the story line kept getting me deeper into them. A pretty good book."
5,Hostile Witness Review,The book Hostile Witness kept my interest from the first page. Loved it. Purchased it with first only reading the summary of the story and was completely happy with the choice that I made. I will tell others to read the book as well.
4,Very good read,"First of all I'm very pleased whenever I download a free book and I actually end up liking it and this was the case with Hostile Witness. From the beginning when we are first introduced to Linda, the college roommate desperate for help when her 17 year old daughter is accused of murdering her father-in-law, who is also a high profile Judge, to when we meet Josie the attorney who agress to help get Linda's daughter Hannah out of jail. I was drawn to the storyline because I kept going back and forth as to who was the murderer and I like when a book keeps me guessing. There were also some very good courtroom scenes, but I especially liked how Hannah's OCD would come out when she was in court because you didn't know how she was going to be perceived by the jury. There were some parts of the storyline that I felt could have used some additonal development but all in all I would recommend this book. I mean really what have you got to lose but what you spent which is nothing :)"
3,a good read,"This book by Forster was a really good read. The characters were well developed and the plot was very interesting. It took reading to the end to find the answers you are seeking and it was well worth reading the whole book to find them out. I enjoyed it.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
5,Unexpectedly great,"How good could a ""free""book be? It was definitely engrossing, Good character development and a plot with a few twists that keeps you reading!"
2,Thriller??,"This book did not thrill much at all. I went to sleep several times during the first third of the book. My husband asked me why I didn't just quit reading it. I should have. The first third was mainly narrative and boring information that should have been woven in the book itself, given to the reader a little at a time. The pace picked up a little toward the end of the book. I found myself skimming some of the boring information. Then it was mainly dialogue between the female lawyer and her ex-friend. The characters sort of blended together and if their name wasn't mentioned, I wouldn't have known who was talking."
3,Good book,Easy read kept me very interested to see what would happenNext. I really enjoy reading this book. Would recommend it friends
1,WHY??,I started this Kindle book as it was recommended because I had finished an Agatha Christie book. The first chapter was very interesting but shortly into the second chapter the f-bomb was thrown in my face 4x in two pages. I removed the book from my kindle but wondered if there shouldn't be some kind of a rating system. None of the reviews warned about the language. I can choose a movie knowing what I might see with a PG or R rating. Wish I could choose a book with foreknowledge of age appropriateness.
3,Umm it was ok!,Very boring beginning and I think they avoided details that would make for good drama. Good book for the cost (free) but I wouldn't pay for it.
4,A psychological thriller,"I give it a solid four. It was easy to read,and the characters were believable and interesting. Some places the story seemed a bit forced ,but all in all a good read ."
3,Enjoyable,"I enjoyed reading the book but do not think it is a real ""thriller"". I will likely read the next book in the series"
4,Hostile witness,Enjoyed reading this book. Kept me my interest to the end. Would recommend book to those who love mystery. Topical of issues in the courts today regarding teenager being tried as an adult.
4,Great Read!,"This was the first thriller I read on my Kindle, and I am very impressed! I really couldn't put it down."
4,Good book,This was my first time reading this author...Very good book. I thought the characters were well written and the plot had depth.
2,I didn't like it,"I didn't like the author's writing style, she tends to over describe every thing, the people, building design, everyone's background and appearance, etc. I found myself skipping pages at a time. You could skip the first 3 or 4 chapters and not miss much. I thought the legal/courtroom part was unrealistic; how could they have gone to trial without the defense attorney thoroughly deposing all of the witnesses, the family, household staff and most importantly the defendant?This book had good reviews so I kept reading, hoping it would get better-I got about half way through the book, gave up and skipped to the last 2 chapters to find out who the murderer was. Suspenseful, it was not. Thriller, not. Just long and not very good. Frankly the ending was lame."
2,ok read,This story is very predictable. I figure out who did it and why way too early.Since this was a free book so it was worth what I paid.
4,Good Read,"This was my first Rebecca Forster. I very much enjoyed this read and have purchased 3 more in the seies,"
2,Boring,"This seems more like the writing of a mildly talented high school student than a polished piece of writing. The composition is immature and strained. I found it boring, set it down, and doubt I will ever finish it."
5,Great legal thriller,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The plot is good, the characters believable and the legalese is uncomplicated.I enjoyed this book so much that I have now purchased the rest of the Witness series by this author."
3,Let's put it ...,"... this way, the author is no John Grisham!Tended to meander a bit, the end got exciting but not really gripping"
4,Exciting and suspencful book,"I really enjoyed reading this book. It was well written and it had a lot of action. The characters were well defined. It held my attention and kept me reading more and more to see what was going to happen. I had never read anything by this author before, so i was quite happy with choosing this exciting story. Thank you for all the great free books that you are offering Kindle Fire owners."
4,Hostile witness,I liked Hostile Witness. It's a good suspense book and It kept me wondering who did it until the end.
4,Easy to read!,Very fluide write and very easy to read! To read without thinking...if you know what I mean...The characteres are shallow but the narrative fluids.
5,Great Read!,Hostile Witness is a very well written legal thriller. It certainly kept my interest from beginning to end. Am anxious to read more of Rebecca Forster's work.
3,Average,"The beinning of the book was boring. But, It did start t climax in the middle. I really enjoyed the ending. I wished the entire book was more like the ending. Overall it is an average read."
4,liked it,I thought the book was very good. it kept you wondering throughout. i would recommend this book to someone who enjoys books like James Patterson's. it reminded me of the kind of books he writes
5,Excelent thriller,Rebecca Foster is as good as James Patterson!Can't wait to read the rest of the Witness Series.Good work.
4,Hostile Witness,I enjoyed reading this book. The reason I just gave it a 4 is I read so many mystery novels that it lacks just a little in what I like. Definitely worth reading. (also wasn't happy with the mom in this book-but set that aside because it's part of the story)
4,witness,Good action with ever changing situations. Makes for a good reading line with interest and eager awaiting. Good recommendation for all.
4,"Surpisingly Good, Great Price","Considering I spent nothing on this ebook, I was thrilled to discover that I had about $8.00 worth of entertainment. The story is a legal thriller with just enough courtroom scenes to make the label accurate, and features a great cast of characters. The dialogue was believable and the mystery at the center of the novel was just convoluted enough to provide some surprises as the story unfolded. The weakest link in this novel was the main character, and I hope as I start the 2nd book in the series that Josie Bates becomes more real, and less of a stock character.Entertaining, and worth your time if you like courtroom books."
3,Hostile Witness,"This is a disturbing book that I have not finished but might go back to. The ingenue has compelling qualities, but has some most unsettling habits. It doesn't seem to fit well with her bond with her mother who has her own issues. The heroine in the book is appealing enough but also troubled. Archer seems the only stable character and we know little about him. It was easy to walk away from it when a better book was available."
5,A pretty darn good read!,"This keeps you reading and wanting more. The writer keeps tuned and locked in, then offers a twisted end. Love it, keep up the good work! Recommended!"
2,Hostile Witness,"Oh, yes....this is the story of the girl with a rotten attitude and the investigator who lives the laid back California lifestyle. Too annoying to enjoy."
5,MUST READ for LOVERS OF LEGAL THRILLERS!,"This is a MUST READ SERIES for lovers of courtroom tactics and drama. The thriller genre is lucky to have writers that can bring a story to life like Rebecca Forster can. In the WITNESS SERIES, Rebecca has created a fascinating world with flawed yet sometimes loveable characters. In Hostile Witness, you will find yourself rooting for the good guy while desperately trying to figure out who the bad guy really is from one minute to the next and in Hannah Sheraton's complex world this isn't the easiest ting to figure out. Enter Josie, the head strong passionate lawyer who isn't afraid to stand on her own laurels and you've got a winner. The rest of the supporting characters bring the true grit of life, love, deception, rejection and all of life's other emotions to life. I can't urge anyone strongly enough to READ THIS SERIES!"
5,Can't put it down!,"Couldn't put it down. Every time I had figured it out, the story turned. Coming out in audio soon!!! Can't wait to read the rest or the Witness series. What a writer!"
4,Good and it was free!,"This is a really good read and even better it was free. Could use some spell checking and proof reading, but otherwise it definitely keeps you interested."
4,A Page Turner,"I purchased this book because it was free and I like legal thrillers. It kept my interest and I have purchased the others in the series. Forster tends to drift off subject sometimes but comes back quickly. Good for a fun, quick read."
3,Could have been better,"It was an OK book. Not a ""can't put it down until the end"" kind of book. It had a good story line, justtook a long time to reach the end."
4,Fast Paced Action,"Hostile Witness is one of those books you enjoy not putting down.It had me from the first few pages.If you like a book that has it all,read this one."
4,Hostile Witness: Rebecca Forster,"Was reccommended to me by a friend. I found it a great read if you like a thriller type story; Couldn't believe / understand that it was on the free list. I had it in mind that I would add this author to my favorites list' Unfortunately my friend tells me that other books by this author, that he paid for were no where near as good! So I don't know about any others, but this was a good read.Bill"
4,Entertaining!,"This is a good mystery. The plot is well developed, and so are the characters, though I will admit I wasn't particularly impressed with the protagonists lawyering skills. To be able to convince myself that a pro who had once been there-done that, and once tasted heights of success as a defence attorney, could get so emotionally involved with a case, is difficult. At certain places in the narrative, she almost appeared as psychotic as the murderer!But that aside, the narrative is nice and easy to read. The mystery is intriguing enough to keep turning the page. Recommended reading for people who like legal-mysteries."
5,wow!!!!!!!,All I can say is AMAZING! I didn't ever want to stop reading this! Definatly had a few sleepless nights reading this one. This book is a must read!
5,Great book!,Well written page turner with several plot twists that I did not foresee. A fun read for anyone who enjoys this genre.
4,ENJOYABLE!,I found the story had a great plot and held my interest all the way through. I like suspense and this was filled with suspense from beginning to end. I would have given it five stars but I did not carefor the course language. I personally think it would have been justas good without using profanity. Moral values used in literature helpto instill moral values in it's readers and we could definantly use more of that.
2,A realistic review not based on price.,"This book starts strong and interesting but loses a lot ground in the middle. The story, while already a stretch, takes a detour into the ridiculous. While the author doesnt insult our intelligence by spelling everything out in great detail, they then seem to contradict that by adding scenes to make already made points. They add nothing to the plot or delivery and derail the believability even more. While lot of books seem to stall in the middle, or crash at the end. This one takes a different tact and runs off into absurd.If John Grisham books set the standard, and they're rated 4-4.5 by amazon readers, this book is rated very fairly at a 2. I think that this author shows a lot of promise but is going to need a better editor."
2,Issues,"I sadly have to agree with the more negative reviews. I thought the characters were shallow and the book had too many editing errors which kept making it difficult to enjoy. The story was ok, but the main character wasn't all that interesting. This is not my favorite Forster book."
3,Pleasant Reading but not Great Literature,"I've been enjoying this book as an easy read, but certainly no stretch of the imagination. Also, the fact that it was free for my Kindle makes it more attractive."
2,Book is a really bad episode of Law & Order,"Something to read if you are bored but I assure you, there are better books out there. This is a tiny bopper book. Poor story development. Story is cliche; think Desperate Housewives meets Days of our Lives.It was free so can't complain too much."
4,Entertaining,"A few reviewers suggested this author needed an editor for various reasons. She must have found one because it read perfectly for me.I totally enjoyed this exciting book. Loved the character development, and the ending was wonderful.This book has it all; family drama, court room adventure, death, and love."
3,Hostile Witness #1,It is better than most free books. I actually enjoyed it. Too bad the other books in the series arent free.
3,Good legal thriller with the usual typos.,"Flawed female lawyer has young client thrust on her. Guilty? Don't ask. This book is dark, well written, tense, with plenty of flawed characters who don't always do the right thing. A good read. The usual annoying typos that will never be caught by spell-check...is this because the book is electronic or have all the good editors and proof-readers been fired now that publishers have computers?"
4,Great!!,I enjoyed this book very much and will read more from this author if available. It will be hard to figure out the ending!
4,Excellent Read!,Character development and suspense are not lacking in this novel. I enjoyed this book and look forward to more by this author.
3,"Refreshing plot, but the editing is subpar","I would have liked to give this book more stars. The plot itself was excellent, but there were so many typos and grammatical errors that it drove me nuts- and usually that kind of thing doesn't really bother me. Typos, missing words, misplaced/misused punctuation, missing punctuation was sadly a distraction, and I don't think there was a single page that didn't have at least one error. Five star plot, but should have chosen a better proofreader, if one was even used to begin with."
2,Pathetic editing,"The story itself is interesting. The poor(or total lack of) editing, however, is a huge distraction. Misspelled words, poor punctuation, pronoun errors, etc., interrupt the reading. Even the most basic proofreader should be able to recognize that there is a difference between ""your"" and ""you're""--and that's just one example of glaring errors. It's a shame that a good story is diminished by such carelessness."
1,could put it down,I was looking for a freebie courtroom drama and this was my first download on to my new tablet. I loved reading it on this contraption but soon tired of the plot. i am now reading huckleberry fin and it's excellent.
4,Lots of twists,"Good, easy read. Not a John Grisham book dor sure, but still pretty good. At times a little slow going, but overall really enjoyed it. Surprises in several places (don't want to give too much away). I would definetly recommend this book."
5,Great!,"Excellent book! Although the book was used, it was in amazing condition! I have already ordered other titles from this author!"
4,Worth a read,"Enjoyed reading this one. I hadn't expected much but it hooked me in, sooner than I expected. Well worth a read"
4,Review of Hostile Witness,I like mysteries and had gotten into British mysteries. I am glad to recommend an American mystery that is not one by one of the popular authors.
4,Very Good Read,"I enjoyed this book very much. It kept you guessing and interested. If it hadn't been free, I would have passed it up, and that would have been a shame."
5,Excellent read!!,"If you love whodunits, you will love this book. Just when you think you have it figured out, you'll be left wondering again. A real page-turner."
4,Thriller,"This is the first time that I read a book from Rebecca Forster.She really keep every link to this thriller at it""s peek.She had me on the edge to really wanting to find out who really did it.Would recommend this book to my friends."
5,My New Favorite Author.,I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was an easy and quick read. Ms. Forster is an excellent storyteller. I will definitely seek out more of her books.
4,Loved this book!,"I really enjoyed reading this book. It was well-written with well-developed characters and a nicely woven plot. I wish there had been more courtroom drama, only because I like that kind of book, but there was plenty of drama! Toward the end there was a bit too much ""Deus ex machina"" but the loose ends were all tied up nicely and I was left feeling satisfied. I'm looking forward to reading more from Ms. Forster."
4,A good read,"Suspense, I read this book constantly wanting to know what was happening to the family. A thriller, with a twist."
5,great!,"Loved the plot, kept wanting to pick it up to finish it - a good read for anyone who likes mystery."
2,Tough Read,Found this book extremely difficult to get into. Too much character set-up and too much about relationships prior to getting into the guts of the storyline. Picked up interest about halfway through.
2,Not Much To Like,"I was looking for a good legal thriller, having been disappointed by the recent attempts by Grisham and Turrow. Amazon pointed me toward Hostile Witness, and the reviews were sparkling. There were over 20 ratings, and almost all were glowing. Plus at $2.99 (for a Kindle download) the price was right. What a disappointment.First of all, this book is in desperate need of an editor. It is filled with misspellings, and grammar poor enough to make a fourth grader blush. Then there are the characters. Most of them are painfully thin. Good, richly drawn characters can make up for a host of shortcomings; but Hostile Witness has only three characters with any depth at all. The rest are one dimensional. Lastly, the mystery itself was incredibly easy to solve. It was about as tough to figure out as an episode of Matlock.So my search for an exciting legal thriller continues. But it won't include any books by Rebecca Forster."
1,Boring read,This book is really hard to get into the characters are all meshed together and its boring the first 6 chapters i put it down after that. and i usually like thriller novels
3,Good read and satisfying ending,"Hostile Witness was the first Rebecca Forster novel I've read, and with that said I likely would read another.It's apparent rather quickly that the author possesses legal knowledge, and I loved her means of description. She has a way of painting characters and scenes as if I were watching them play out as a movie. However, with that said, my only negative comment is there were quite a bit of cliches throughout the book. This came as a bit of a disappointment because from other passages I know the author is very talented and could have effectively reworded these to get at what she was driving for.If you love legal thrillers and courtroom action this book is for you. Forster integrates courtroom drama in manageable doses so as not to slow the pace of the story.Overall a good book, and a more than satisfying ending."
4,Very good story,"This is a very good story. Keeps you interested to the very end. I won't go into detail but if you like a good suspense story, you will enjoy this one."
4,hostel witness,thought it was very good keeped you waiting to know who really killed him did't like the mother at all
4,Suspense laden!,"Great book!! It pulls you in quickly and then you are committed. You can't stop reading because you NEED to figure out what is going to happen with these characters. They are very well developed, and not only likable but relatable. The story twists and turns, but is still very believable!I can honestly say that I would highly recommend this book!"
5,Page turner,"Enjoyed, once you get started it quickly becomes a page turner. I finished this book in 3 evenings. I will look at other books by this author."
3,Hostile Witness,"I really liked this book. Its my first book from Rebecca Forster, and I liked her style and loved the ending. Thrillers are some of my favorites along with mysteries."
3,Hostile Witness,Hostile witness is an ok read nothing to heavy or involved ideal for a holiday read or to kill time on the train or bus
4,Legal thriller,"Well written, kept my interest throughout. Ending was not a complete surprise yet was interesting to see how the events unfolded."
5,Awsome,Having just served on my first jury for local... This book was awsome...! I would recommend it for anyone interested in justice and crime investigation...
4,Good read,"I'm certainly no critic and this book didn't ""Wow me"" but it flowed easily and sometimes it's nice to have a book that is pleasant but you don't feel like you're going to die if you don't sit down and read it cover to cover in two days."
4,"So far, so good.",So far it's a 4. I haven't finished it yet. You should allow more time before asking for a book rating.
4,Very good book!,Hostile Witness is a very good book. The is first time that I have read this author and I was pleasantly surprised. I'm looking forward reading more of her work.
4,Hostile Witness,Excellent story I look forward to reading more of her books! Great characters I did not want to put the book down. She has a way to draw you in!!! Thanks for a GREAT BOOK!
3,What are you hungry for?,"I'm not a huge fan of legal thrillers. That one is not that bad but it still did not meet my expectations, that all those 5 star reviews certainly raised a bit too high...I actually bought 2 books at once:1 - a micro Crime & Thriller novel by new author Thomas Temple (Vodka on Fire (Daily Murders))2 - that book by Rebecca Forster.The first one was like an adrenaline shot to me, while that one was more like a long, heavy dinner slowly filling in my stomach.Reading those 2 ones one after the other may have biased my opinion, but I guess it all depends what you want to feel and experience in the end."
4,Hostile Witness,Overall good storyline. Liked the flow of the book until the end where it just wrapped up too easily and fast. But it does leave you wondering about the girl and if she is guilty or innocent. I would recommend it to others. It's a good read.
3,Ok,I WOULD NOT SEEK OUT THIS AUTHOR.DONE AND SOON FORGOTTEN. I prefer a Grisham style story by an author who has more literary style.
5,Everything for the avid reader!,"Much mystery, some romance and very well written. You'll love it as you attempt to solve this ""who done it!"""
4,Filled with suspense,Rebecca Forster kept me in suspense for the whole read. Was very surprised at the ending. Forster knows how to keep your attention.
3,Hostile Witness,This book will keep you guessing until the very end. Looking forward to reading more books by this author soon.
3,Saw ya coming!!,"Actually a good read. The action is set against a suburban background where Josie Baylor-Bates is trying to hide from the hustle of a big-city practice. Through an old room-mate she finds herself in the thick of it, again."
2,"A pathetic series, poorly written",Truly a sad excuse for a novel. Story line very thin and extremely boring. The entire series is a waste of time and money.
5,Excellent Read,"HOSTILE WITTNESS will grab you ftrom the first and pull you into the plot with the first page. It would be difficult to find a much more dysfunctional family than the Rayburns. When 16 yo Hannah is charged with the murder of her Step-grandfather, and and her mother comes begging for help, Josie is pulled back into the world of Criminal Defends Law that she had sworn off 3years ago."
5,Hostile Witness,"Great book. Prior to this book had not read anything by this author, She's Great. Keep me guessing through the whole book, I bought the rest of the series and can't wait to get started reading. If you like a Good Thriller with a twist I think you will like this author."
5,Hostile Witness,"Downloaded free as it sounded ok. Was so impressed I have been back to download the next in the series, not free, but well worth it.Great to have the confidence to give a free book of the first in the series and know that readers will buy the rest in the series.Thanks"
4,Interesting,"So far, the characters seem intriguing,& the story moves along at a good pace. Haven't finished it yet, so (no pun intended), the jury's still out."
1,unbelievable,"I bought this program to help my 6th grader. The cover brags about having 11 CDs covering 19 topics. My first problem is, where is the math!? The first CD contains 3 games that deal with probability and engineering. The written explainations of the problems look they they belong on the board of a college engineering class. I searched through all the other CDs and there is no other math! What a let down.Some of the disk have programs on them that look like they were written in 1980, and geared for 6-7 year olds. At least 3 of the disk will not run on my brand new computer at present, because I have media player 10 and not an older version.Save your money on this one, and buy indivdual programs for the subjects you want."
1,Disappointing,"I thought I'd try out this software because I had seen it often in the computer store and wanted to assist my 8th grader with basic middle school work over the summer break. The nicely laid out subjects shown on the box (such as Pre-Algebra, Algebra I and Algebra II) had no corrolation to the titles included in the packet. Some of the disks seem geared toward 3rd graders and insult the intellect of the middle school student. Others are much more advanced (aka the Engineering (or ""Math"" cd) Funny the box doesn't mention anything about learning Engineering?)The graphics quality on many of the disks are very poor and do seem like they were created for much older computers. There are much more challenging and informative websites that are out there right now. All in all, this seemed like some cd's were just thrown together for the purpose of this."
2,easy to dent,"While the bat has good performance for a single wall bat overall it lacks in durablity. In a 60 and over league ware the players are much weaker than the player that are 30 or 40 years old, the bats don't stand up more than a couple of months. In fact My bat was egge shape in a couple of games. Regardless of how careful I was to turn it each time I used it.Now I'm not a home run hitter [I'm happy to find a hole in the infield.]I'm 180 pounds and 78 years old, which should limit my ability to dent bats."
3,good,One of the very best aftermarket kits for what it was designed to fit and function with. The ad wasnt specific enough though- did not fit my 1986 Dodge Ram 50/ Mitsubishi Mighty Max
1,"Did not work, had to return this piece of JUNK!!!",It drives me nuts when a brand new item fails to work from the get go. Then you have the big hassle of returning the darned thing.I won't buy anything from SONY for a LONG time.Buy one for 1/4 the price that will WORK.
4,Very good and useful,"I think that this big book will give you a lot of tips and ideas about how to spice up the action in your bedroom. The drawings are simple and non-offensive but still show very well each of the positions. There are plenty of variations to try as well. ""Daily Sex"" can be very useful as a conversation starter. After all you have to communicate with your partner about your specific and different desires throughout the year and the accent on diversity in the book is right on. If you want something more then definitely pair it with the outstanding ""Scientificlly guaranteed male multiple orgasms and ultimate sex"" by scientist Ritz. Overall this is a very good book given its numerous tips, positions, value and price. I am sure that it will help you to have a great time as well!"
3,"A lot of information, but the pictures are distracting","I bought this book to learn some unique and different methods than what I was used to. While I didn't expect to use a good portion of the positions featured (I mean, who can really have sex 365 different ways!) I found some of them just physically impossible. I am flexible and in shape and so is my fiance, but some of these are just better in theory than in actuality- I realize everyone is different but I feel like a lot of the things in here are just in here so they can say they have nearly 400 positions. And it is not all about intercourse, just fyi (I believe I even saw a page with a golden shower ....) If you just want to buy a book to subtly say you want to spice things up, this is fine (and you'll have a few laughs at the illustrations) but if you want a step by step guide, this is not the book for you."
1,Not Worth The Money........,"We received the book and were excited for some new ""bedroom ideas"" however after just reading and looking through the fist chapter (first month) we were very disappointed with our purchase. In just the first 30-days (positions/activities) I think there were at least 6 - 8 repeats with just different names and the ""pictures"" (really just rough drawings) were less than impressive or even worth looking at as the people looked very strange, the body parts/areas were less than ""groomed"" and they just were not worth it. The bottom line is that within just a few days we were submitting our request to return the book. Do not spend your money on this one, shell out a few more dollars and get a higher quality book if you really need one."
3,Decent enough,Some of the posisions are outrageous and really hard... sometimes impossible. Although with 365 ideas it kept things interesting for a long time
3,Good general ideas but repetitive,"This book is fun for spicing up the relationship. We really enjoy reading the descriptions which are sometimes comical. A variety of ideas but positions repeat with just slight variations. On the other hand, anything that brings more sex into your life can't be that bad."
3,repeating same positions,"there was no new positions in this book to me except for the first page...the rest of the positions was the same stuff over and over again. we had fun trying the first few pages but when we looked for something new, there was nothing new about the positions, just their names."
1,Not Satisfied,"The title of the book is, ""365 Positions and Activities for a Year of Great Sex!"" The same positions are repeated several times, and I mean several times. This book is not at all what I expected. Very poor quality. If I would have known I would not have ordered it."
5,Sexy and in good taste,"We found some of the position a litle boring, but several made it worth purchasing the book. The positions are drawn and not photos, which is something we were wanting. Worth adding to your library."
2,Been there done that,"I thought this book would offer something I already didn't know, but I was wrong .I have done all the positions in this book at one point or another in my adult life."
5,An awesome album,"I found the tape of this album in my dad's collection and fell in love with it. I turned the cassette into mp3s, but they're not the best quality. It's really unfortunate that there seems to be no way to get this music for a reasonable price (given that I don't own a record player).What strikes me most about this album is the message in their songs -- they are so clear and meaningful. And on top of that, the music itself is unlike anything else I've heard.Anyway, i really want more, but i'm unwilling to shell out 50$/album."
5,GIG In a hurry!,"If your looking for a place to store all your HD video this is the pill for the ill. Of course the drive is formatted for Mac, so if your PC user I'm not sure what the compatability is. Witht the 6-pin to 6-pin firewire I plugged it in, turned it on and ""Poof"" 500 GIG. With no fan the drive is quiet and the exterior is stylish. Very Happy with my purchases."
3,Comprehensive fake book,"I already have the Country Fake Book in this series, so felt confident about buying this. It contains a wide selection of songs from around the world, mainly US and UK from 'A-hunting we will go' to 'Zum Gali Gali'. Although 'over 1000 folksongs' are claimed, the index only shows 535. All the material is public domain, so I feel the price ($24.95) is rather high."
3,The Folksong Fake Book,THought it would have more popular folk songs. Turned out it had little known ones.
1,WOW,"I can purchase these locally for $97 for a box of 3,600. Their nails are $300 for 6000 which is a considerable overcharge. You'd be better off at your local lumberyard.."
1,sounds like a bad audience recording,"The bottom line is that Vinnie Appice sucks. Pointless high school marching band drum rolls, badly tuned toms, and an inability to get in a groove sink this record more than anything else. He simply doesn't have BIll Ward's taste or good ear. Unfortunately, the recording quality is as bad as his drumming, a muffled mess that completely drowns Iommi's guitar. The third problem on this record is that while RJ Dio did some good original work with this band, he's simply lost when he tries to do early sabbath material. His angry, all over the place style works on Mob Rules and Dehumanizer, especially the faster tempoed stuff. But for some reason, he just doesn't lock in to the old sab stuff."
1,Alright For What It Is,"Unfortunately when I bought this cd it wasn't through amazon and I was pretty computer illiterate, nowhere on the whole double cd does it say who sings and from the listing of songs I being 15 at the time and born in 81' of course having no clue about Sabbath having more than one singer assumeed it was Ozzy, I was sadly disapointed, I'm not much of a Dio or Rainbow fan love the words but just don't like his voice, but for those of you who love or even kinda like Dio you should definately get this one it's back in his hey-day with Sabbath behind him best Dio ever sounded, the songs are so good I had to give it 1 star even though I can't stand the singing."
1,"If you like this album, you don't know nothing about Sabbath","THis is one of the worst things Sabbath ever recorded. SOng selection is incredible bad, the sound is flat and inocuous, the band mixed it when it was going through strong turbulence (resulting in Dio's departure), Vinnie Appice drumming is awful here (probably he was relegated in the mixing - he appears in the credit as ""guest member""!!!) Well, it's something to be forgotten."
1,Ridiculous! This is not Black Sabbath!,"How can this be the Black Sabbath? Ozzy is not in the band anymore! Why can't the people get it into their heads, Black Sabbath cannot be Black Sabbath without Ozzy Osbourne; he is Sabbath's first singer and the one who made Black Sabbath the father of Heavy Metal! As for Dio, he shouldn't be singing Ozzy's songs as if like he made them, Ozzy made them!If you want real Black Sabbath albums, buy all their albums with Ozzy from their self titled album all the way to the Reunion album. Avoid any non-Ozzy Black Sabbath albums, they won't sound the same and won't be the same as the original Black Sabbath."
4,Stick with the original Warner issue CD,"Don`t let anyone tell you different. This is a great CD. The performances are strong. I just wish the song ""Die Young"" was on here. I have heard all 3 versions and to be honest nothing beats the original Warner version, 2 disc set. I don`t like the fact that they chopped up the newer versions, taking stage banter out, removing some musical passages and fading out the song ""Fluff"". Plus some of the cymbals in the mix sound weird. Not much else to say. I just wanted to really promote the original mix of the warner version. The point of re-issues is to add something new to an album most of us already own. In this case I really believe the new versions offer nothing new, and take away from what already was a great version."
2,The Video is quality's poor,I love rap-hip hop music but also i like to see and listen it with a good quality not like this vhs.
1,Geometry: Misconnections,"This is a very poor math textbook. Here's the main problem: End-of-chapter problem sets require knowledge and skills that have not been clearly introduced in the chapter. Chapters meander through irrelevant or mundane points (e.g., how to bisect an angle using a compass...this is middle school stuff) but then call on different skills in problem sets (e.g., where was this postulate discussed in the chapter?). If you are looking for a good geometry book, I suggest that you look elsewhere. Unfortunately, our school district didn't."
1,A staple hammer that does not work,"I bought this unit to replace an ARROW staple hammer that did not have a bent handle which meant that you were always mashing your figers in tight places. But this BOSTITCH unit, while it keeps your fingers away from the work, the staples do not feed well. It will not take more than one length of staples because if you try to use more than one, the slider bar that locks the staples in place will break them apart. The stapler itself will tend to try to feed more than one staple at a time and then just plane jams up. You spend more time unjaming this unit than you will using it. It is by far the worest hand tool I have ever bought and has forced me to go back to the ARROW unit and watch my fingers more closely. Do not buy this product."
1,bostitch [messed]up,"I've been in construction for 15 years now and have used the ""old"" bostitch H-2B stapler for years and loved it.Last summer I went to order a couple more and found out they were discontinued; I checked everywhere ; even @ a repair facility that has the parts to rebuild them; no one has any of them left.I called Bostitch directly and they said the ""new"" one takes the same staples ; WRONG so I bought the grand slammer and I hate it ; the staples are hard to keep in the rail while closing the ram and they jam as easily as the ""cheap"" arrow t-50's did; I didn't mind spending $100.00 for a stapler I could rely on and one that was easy to replace or clean the parts; I WISH they would begin making the H2B again PLEASE!"
1,Worst tool I have bought so far.,"I bought this tool based on looks and thinking the hefty price would mean a quality tool. The Bostitch web site says ""Jam Free Design"". This thing CONSTANTLY jams! Very frustrating when you are on a ladder trying to attach felt paper or insulation. You cna clear the jam (remove all staples and pry out jamed staples) then put in new staples and maybe shoot 5 or 10 staples before it jams again."
5,The best hammer stapler yet,"This stapler works great. Your fingers don't get pinched like other hammer staplers. When you use the correct staplers (Power Crown), the stapler doesn't jam. This is the best hammer stapler I've owned."
5,"In My Opinion, one of Walter Farley's Best !!","I was able to enjoy this book immensely! The details Walter Farley gave were incredible. You didn't miss a thing! You always knew everything that was going on with Man O' War. There wasn't too much detail either. It wasn't 350 pages of blah. In this book you were able to live through all of the races, dissapointment, and momentous occasions of Man O' War and his stable hand Danny. Danny was a loyal young man who more than anything wanted to be with his horse Man O' War. Any horse lover who has a special horse close to their heart or just loves horses in general will be able to relate to Danny's love for Man O' War!I definitely recommend Man O' War as a must read for any horse lover!I hope this was of some help for you! Happy Reading!!"
5,one of the greats,"Man o' War was a great horse and still is a great book. I've always been fascinated by horse racing. Most of Walter Farley's books are fictional and the Black and Satan are to good to be true. Man o' War's racing career seemed like as much of a fairy tale as his other characters' but it is true. I love this book. I believe there will never be another horse as good as ""Big Red"" to set foot on the track."
2,Fiction with faults,"Walter Farley. Humm. The best of the book is the training and schooling of a feisty foal who went on to become perhaps the greatest Thoroughbred racehorse in the world. The great fault of the book is that much isn't true, it's repetitive. I skimmed the last half of this book. Ultimately disappointing."
5,"Man o' War, an AMAZING Thoroughbred Champion!!!","This was the best book I've ever read!! If you love horses, horseracing and Man o' War, I highly recomend this book! Even if you don't have an interest in horses, you would still love this book! It's about Man o' War from the night he was foaled, to the tragic day he died... It gives you full details of his races, winning an astonishing 20 of his 21 starts..The race he lost, I think was unfair! (Read to find out!!) It tells alittle about some winners he sired..I learned a lot about this amazing Champion from reading this book...There is soOo much more I can say about this book..but I want you to read to find out!! ENJOY IT!! I KNOW YOU WILL!!*"
5,Hello to the girls & Guys at Hobo Farms,"1970, the summer before my 3rd yr in high school I moved to work and live on a Thoroughbred farm in Ocala Fla. I was to exercise horses on a full size track. The farm was owned by Kodak Camera Company, Hobo Farms. There were several young woman in their early 20's at the barn I was to work in. I had missed meeting Walter Farley. The girls looked for themselves in his Black Stallion books and I always thought he had written about one of them, a spunky tiny thing who looked no bigger than a 5 year old on the big horses.Needless to say we had read all Farley's books and Man 'O War was by far the best. I never understood why it never became a movie for Man 'O War was written with the brilliance of a Walt Disney story. Do you remember 'The Horse With the Flying Tail'?"
1,After downloading I could not open it,Something happened that after downloading I could not open it again. I have to call Amazon and complain. Will do that.
3,Not moderm music,"If you like standard Carribean music, then this CD is for you. It includes the traditional sounds of the samba, and a lot od rums. My favorite song is ""El alacran."" The music and the lyrics are festive and happy."
1,questionable,"I think there is some evidence about blood type eating being beneficial, but too much garbage in the book to weed through."
2,Didn't work for me.,"Some people swear by these blood type diets, and their logic sort of makes sense. I tried it seriously for 3 months and I didn't notice a difference in my health status or energy level. Oh well. [...] offers a nutrition-typing program that I might try but it sounds a little subjective."
5,Very Helpful,"This book is great for the person who has had all sorts of physical problems. If you follow the advice of this doctor, you will see pounds disappear and you will feel so much better! I found the book to be very valuable."
2,Too much to comprehend,"To complicated, need a medical degree to figure this out. The other books are much better. It is in no way and easy read."
3,It's okay,Still reading this one as well. Its okay. Condition is acceptable..Thought I was getting the 2004 edition. But this is the 2002 edition.
3,Eat Right for Your Type Complete Blood Type Encyclopedia,"Very clinical, slow to read and absorb the information, but very interesting. Eat right has shown me a lot about where I fail my well being by what is missing in my nutrition choices."
3,EATING RIGHT,THIS WAS A VERY EDUCATIONAL BOOK. IT WAS RECOMMENDED BY MY DOCTOR. I THINK THAT THE LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY OF THE BOOK IS GREATER THAN MANY PEOPLE WOULD ENJOY. IT REQUIRES MORE THAN A SINGLE READING TO UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPTS. IT ALSO RECOMMENDS A LOT OF HERBAL REMEDIES OF VARIOUS CONDITIONS WHICH COULD BE A LITTLE COST PROHIBITIVE. THE DIET GUIDE WAS SIMPLE AND EASY TO FOLLOW BUT REQUIRED THAT YOU HAVE A GOOD GRASP OF THE BOOK'S CONCEPTS IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND WHY TO EXCLUDE FOODS FROM YOUR DIET. I ENJOYED THE BOOK AND WILL REREAD MUCH OF IT. I AM ALSO FOLLOWING MANY OF ITS GUIDELINES FOR EATING FOR MY BLOOD TYPE.
3,it was okay,I bought the book thinking that it would help me learn how to eat for my blood type but I find it very difficult to follow and difficult to read it. This is more like an index for health problems and if you are susseptible to them by what your blood type is.
2,This book needs more information,"This book needs more information and some sort of telephone numbers or contacts to understand what exactly need to be done for certain problems. For example, it recommends some protocols to use, but it is not clear as to we should use all of it at one time or are they optional, meaning can we use any one of them. It will also be helpful if it says where these are available. This book was not as helpful as I expected it to be."
3,This Helps,"This is the third time I have bought this book. I make the mistake of loaning it out and it never comes back. It is a new look at how to diet. If all other diets have failed you, you are not eating right for you blood type or secretor static."
3,Eat Right,"The book, as indicated by the title, is filled with information, usually in small succinct paragraphs. However, I would highly encourage a person interested in the relationship between our blood type and the foods we eat, even the vitamins we take, to read Eat Right for Your Blood Type first because it fully discusses theories regarding the reasons we have different blood types, why those changes took place and the effects that has had in the types of food we ""should"" eat. After that, one can read any of the books in the series with an understanding that was lacking when I purchased the encylopedia first."
1,Polymer aging at,I have not seen original publications of the author in the medium- or even in the low impact scientific journals on the subject of the book. It is obviously a compilation of available to him scientific/technical papers. I strongly recommend ignoring this compilation.
2,Has Significant Reliability Problems,"My EX71SL failed after about 8 hours of use. The right channel audio level decreased significantly below that of the left channel. I had to return it Sony in Laredo TX at a USP cost of almost $10. What kind of warrenty is that? Sony should be more like Koss.I gave it that extra star for its bass quality, which is deep bass, smooth & mellow. Really good, true bass can be very exciting because it is heard so infrequently. Bass depends on the speaker, the enclosure and the room accoustics for regular speakers; including where you are in the room. Headphones overcome most of these variables. When comparing headphones, I use Telarc 80235 'Fiesta'. It is a great Latin music CD. It was given a 10/10 for both recording quality and for the music quality by 'CD Mag' (now defunct) several years ago. Anyhow, this Sony has good bass vs boom, boom but unfortunately it is not of much use if it doesn't work properly."
2,Too short!,"I bought these headphones to replace my old Sony headphones. The sound quality is quite good and I trust Sony brand. My main problem is that the headphone cord is too short to put your iPod in your pocket without it pulling your headphones out. I'm a fairly short person, so what the heck? They also come with a headphone extender, but it doesn't work very well. I have to fiddle with the headphone jack on the extender to make both headphones work at the same time (and generally when I put it in my pocket, one of the headphones stops working because the extender is so touchy). I will probably purchase a new pair of headphones."
3,Excessively bright sound tarnishes otherwise perfect in-ear headphones,"These Sony MDR-EX71SL headphones offer deep, accurate bass response, which is just what I was looking for. Unfortunately, they also have tinny-sounding high frequency response. When playing music that is already equalized with the ""rock n' roll smile"" (boosted lows and highs, reduced midrange), the sound is shrill and unpleasant. Even midrange-heavy jazz recorded without equalization seems too bright with the EX71SL's.That's too bad, because aside from the too-bright frequency response, I love these headphones. They're super comfortable. The two-piece behind-the-neck asymmetrical cord design is perfect for active use (especially for cycling). The included case keeps everything neat and tidy, and prevents losing these tiny headphones.Unfortunately, I have to knock 2 stars off for the excessively bright sound. If you (for some reason), prefer extra-bright sound, and also love deep bass, then buy these headphones without hesitation."
2,Great earbuds while it lasted - wires that is...,"Well I bought these 71's because of the sound quality I read about during the opinions. I planned to use these for my MTB rides and around town. Well when I got them they worked like a champ - at least for the first few months...then I noticed something happening to the wire's jacket near the buds - they were turning dirty and softer than the surrounding jacket further down the wire.A few weeks later the jacket was stretching and looks now like it wants to peel off the inner wire!That is the bad side of the earbuds from SONY.THe only good thing I can report is that the sound is the best for the price and they fit my small ear canal. I have bought others and they do not fit as well than SONYs...but with this very major issue with the wiring jacket peeling away from the wiring, I am staying away from SONY.Going to try out the V-moda Bass Freq. The cost is similar to the SONYs, I just hope that the wiring jacket last longer than Sony's."
3,Comes with 2.5mm plug not standard 3.5mm,"The items I received came in a Verizon package designed to be used with a 2.5mm Verizon phone jack phone. This is an uncommon size and unless you can get by with the standard short cord it comes with you'll need an adapter or an extension cord to make the cord long enough for normal use. I bought a 2.5mm female to 3.5mm male adapter from the Shack, but it only works with one of the two sets I bought.Other than that they appear to be standard Sony ear buds, a bit lacking in bass but fairly comfortable and somewhat noise-canceling due to the fact that they cover the ear canal like an ear plug. Still a good price even with the $5 cost of an adapter thrown in."
4,"Great headphones, but not for exercising","I bought these headphones to wear at the gym, but quickly discovered that they don't stay in the ears well during exercise. However, their sound quality is great for the price. They're small, durable, and they do an excellent job of blocking out surrounding noise."
4,Teddy J,"The Sony Fontopia series headphones are my favorite because they have great sound and are very comfortable but quality of the cord is terrible. The cord on the 70 series get fumy and on the 50 series it is still too thin although on my latest set, I have not experienced the gummy quality...yet.Still I like these headphones well enough to continue to be a repeat purchaser (I get about 9 months out of them) although up until now have bought the cheaper 50 series because I Knew they would self destruct. That said they are on sale in $[...] so go for the better quality 70 series."
2,Sony Headphones,The sound quality is great but the design is awkward. Not what I expected. They're either too short or with the extension in they're too long. Not good for exercising.
3,Could be much better!,"I'm really disappointed in the quality and feel of the earbuds. To obtain the highest fidelity, the buds need to be pushed pretty far into the ear. Also, the short left bud line limits placing the armband for jogging to the left arm. When operating and fully inserted, the sound is very good."
2,Not what I expected,"I just bought a Creative Zen Micro and although the stock buds sound really good, I thought the bass to be a bit lacking and I wanted a sealed ear design for working outside . Well I put them on and immediatly noticed the volume didn't go up as loud as the stock ones which was a surprise because it isn't that loud of a player to begin with and is about the only thing I didn't like . I fiddled around with the different sizes, I jammed them in every which was but the fact is, the sound i got from these were not as clear, detailed or loud as the ones that came with my player. So I guess I'll have to move on... I really did want these to work out because I heard how well they sound. All i can say is they were pretty muddy sounding to me and my girlfriend agreed. MAybe the Shures will be next."
3,Short-sighted headphones,"These are some of the best sounding headphones I've used. The bass is more than adequate and it also filters out external noise. Fit is quite good too since it comes with different size buds. Unfortunately, its' worst feature is the length of the cord. It is WAY too SHORT, thus forcing you to use the included extension cord, resulting in a WAY too LONG cord. Very annoying!"
4,Excellent Sound quality,"This is an amazing headphone in terms of sound quality. If you place it properly in your ears, it can provide great bass and block unnecessary noise. Normal headphones for this price do not have the same frequency range.Design of this headphone has received a lot of criticism here.. I wouldn't agree with most of them. The longer length of right ear actually allows the chord to go behind your neck instead of hanging in front of you. It frees you up to talk or walk around with the headphone in place. In addition, the short length of the main chord works great when you keep your ipod/palm/mp3 player in the front top pocket. For all other situations, you have a long extension chord that can be wrapped to desired length using the device supplied.Keeping it properly cleaned was the only problem I observed with this headphone. Since you insert it into your ear, there is a chance that the minute hole may get blocked with dirt etc. That can significantly impact sound quality."
3,Good Sound ..But Kinda Harsh At Times,"I read the reviews on these bud before I got them,but no one mentioned that these buds can be harsh at times in the trebble range(Extremely Bright) Otherwise its a good set.I dont know yet if I will have to replace them in 90 days,but I am already setting my sights on the Shure E2c buds as I write this."
3,"Great Headphones, Bad Warranty","These headphones sound really good. Even the cord design issue many people mention actually is quite intelligent for those people either (a) connecting the short cable to an MP3 player strapped to your bicep, or (b) connecting the long cable to a computer. My complaint is that the left headphone just stopped working one day. This happened exactly 100 days after I bought them, which meant I was out of luck since Amazon's return policy is good for only 30 days and the manufacturer's warranty is good for only 90 days from purchase. I contacted Sony about this, hoping they'd be reasonable and bend the rules for a life-long Sony buyer, but they were not."
3,"Decent, not great.","The one thing I really dislike about this product, is that without the extention cord the cable is too short, and with it it is too long. However, the sound quality is excellent."
1,not a good buy,"These headphones are not a good buy. I was just looking for somthing to replace my ipod headphones so everyone wouldn't know i had an ipod. I recived them a while ago and i was very disapointed with them. What covinced me to buy them were all the great user reviews, but i dont know what they saw in them because they didn't sound good at all. There was not much bass, and the sound quality was terrible. Plus the cord is not strong and can tear easily. Also, these dont block out sounds as much as they say it does. I've been using the ipod headphones for a while and they sound 10 times better. Im not saying these sony's sound bad because im used to better quality,but because they just sound bad period. You can deffinetly get better quality for less money as well. I used to say that sony was the best brand in headphones, but since i purchased these, i can no longer say that."
1,Extension cord is useless,"The actual cord on the earbuds is entirely way too short for us. So Sony added an extension cord, but when I connect it to my iPod only one ear works. This has now happened for two sets. I'm not trying for a third."
4,Very GOOD maybe...the best for the price even.,"These EarBuds are sweet. I bought them to replace my iPod earbuds and boy did they sure do the trick... The Bass on this is amazing. The only thing i don't like about these is you hardly never know if you have them in correctly until u get used to them and break them in. Once they are broken in, they will just slide right into your ear and work just like a charm so you don't have to fuss over if the buds are in your ear right. GREAT BUY!"
3,Decent but not great,"I'm a bit of an audiophile, especially with portable devices. I've used earbuds since they first came out and have tried many, many different kinds. The sound quality and bass is great with these but I can't get them to stay in my ears at all. The medium fit as long as I don't move at all, but the large are too big. I've never had trouble with fit in Sony earbuds before. I was really looking forward to these and was rather disappointed. They just sit now, and I went back to my $10 regular Sony earbuds."
4,Comfortable headphones,"I bought these headphones to replace the un-comfortable ones that came with my Ipod. The Sony MDR-EX71SL are not only more comfortable but also sound better, be sure to place them down into your ear canal. I would have given these 5 stars but I don't care for the design of the wires with one being longer than the other and without using the extra long extension the Ipod doesn't quite make it to my pants pocket."
4,"Great sound, but the wire insulation wears off!","For the price, these in-ear headphones sound great. I can really hear the difference in sound quality compared to my original iPod headphones. However, the wire insulation seems very fragile. At some point, there was a nick in the insulation, and now the covering is coming off on one side. To compound this, the other headphone insulation wire seems to have gotten twisted, and now also has a nick.I really like these headphones (I got used to the over-the-neck style somehow), but using electical tape hasn't really solved the problem (it slowly comes off, scratches against your face, etc.) I use these headphones every day for hours, putting them away, taking them out, so there's definitely heavy usage. Still, I'm wondering if it's too hard to keep them in good condition."
3,Good Headphones,"The sound is very good with the earbuds. But the 'starter' cord is very short. To use at the gym, you need the extension cord .. which is really long. When I synch it up so that it does not dangle everywhere .. then it becomes heavy and causes the earbud to pop-out every so often."
2,"Good sound, comfortable. Cable decaying!",The sound is fine. They are comfortable.But the rubber sleeving of the cables is turning to goo. I think it's a reaction with the sun-block as it seems to be isolated to where the cable passes around the back of my neck and over my ear lobes. This is appalling for soemthing that needs to be wearable outside in sunny weather.
3,"There are better ones, for the price.","I bought a set of these based on the reviews I read here about how quiet they are. They *do* seal out more ambient noise because they ""seal"" your ear shut. However, the Sony MDR-ED228LP are almost as quiet, and have superior sound.One other weird thing: My mp3 player has an FM tuner built in. With these headphones I get lousy FM reception - all noise. With the MDR-ED228LP I get crystal clear reception. Go figure. Who knew the headphones had something to do with reception?(After writing this review, I see the ED228LP are out of stock. But the MDR-ED21LP on this site seem similar.)"
2,Weak,"I don't know if the glowing reviews for this product are Sony's marketing street team or people who have no comprehension of good sound, but these headphones are very weak and flat sounding. The ones that came with my iPod are much fuller and cleaner. And, yes, I broke them in and, yes, I inserted them correctly. Now I'm returning them."
2,They were not mean for heavy use,"I have used mine *heavily* since I bought them in March 2005. The fact that it has an extension cord is great: you can use the short cables to attach to your iPod in your armband without a mess. This works great for the treadmill.9 Months have passed and the left headphone is not woking very well. Just checked and it would cost me $30 to get a replacement. I guess its a bad assumtion to make that all prodcuts come with a one year warranty huh?The headphone plugs do come lose easily, so you have to watch over them when taking them out of a bag or untangling them. Sound is great, but I am dissapointed that they lasted only for 9 months."
2,The sound of frustration,"Truly the most aggravating headphones I have ever owned. The sound is really impeccable, but only for the very short time one is able to keep them inserted in the ears. They will fall out - in my experience with any of the three sizes of ear bud - at the slightest provocation. A light breeze will cause them to unseal, ruining the depth of sound immediately. Turning your head or even the weight of the cord, which is substantial with the utterly necessary extension, will pull them completely out of your ear canal in a matter of minutes. They are useless for running (I even tried taping them to my ears, which, despite not working, is stylistically ridiculous). The first headphones I have actually HATED. Only rate above 1 star because, for the briefest of moments, they also happen to produce the best sound of any in-ear style headphones I have owned."
1,"Great sound quality, but...","The first pair of 71SL's I bought worked perfectly, flawless, it was like wearing a dream...until 2 months later when suddenly the left ear stopped working. I thought that I had just recieved a bad pair, so I went out and bought a new one, but lo and behold, not more then two weeks after buying the new pair, the same exact problem on the same side occured again. Even though the sound quality is excellent and it has to be the most comfortable pair of ear pieces that I have ever worn (I've slept with them in before), I simply can not recommend a product that breaks with less then two weeks of light use."
3,"Great sound,,,,,,stupid design","Yeah,,,so these phones rock with depp base and great sound blocking ability.....but but but...the damn design! The person that designed these should be fired and beaten with a wet noodle! The first thing is that for some odd reason, they decided to make the left ear bud cord really short with a longer length to the right one? Why? This cause more pull on the left bud and an excessive length to the right one......DUMB DESIGN #1!Then they gave an extension cord, which isnt a bad idea, but the non extended piece is only like 2-3 feet long and wont even reach your waist, so then you add on the 4 foot extender and its too long......DUMB DESIGN #2! Aside from this horrible flaw,,the sound is great....can I live with it? Well, I have an iPOd, and fortunately I can slip the iPod remote control cord to my short sleeve to remedy this; but still,,,,the damn left ear bud is always tugging out! POOH!"
1,Painful,"More bass than my ipod earbuds, but they are uncomfortably bright. They have absolutely no midrange so vocals sound thin and sibilant. Snare drums and cymbals are so bright they cut your head off. Perfect for accentuating artifacts of lossy compression.The worst sounding earbuds I've tried yet.Amazon is twisting the knife by charging a fee to return them."
1,1 star is pushing it,"These things are garbage-Which is precisely where they ended up after I attempted to use them. The sound quality was spotty, cord cumbersome and the worst was the fact that they continuously popped out of my ears. Don't waste your money."
1,Poor Base response,"I recently purchased the above earphones as a more comfortable alternative to the standard set that came with my RIO Nitrus. The Sony earphones are indeed more comfortable but the sound quality is very poor, especially in the base range. The resulting sound is reminiscent of a 1930's radio -- Just the opposite of Sony's claim that they deliver a ""deep bass sound"". Even with the RIO's five-band equalizer I could not get the Sony MDR-EX71SL's to sound any better than about a ""3"" on a 10-point scale. To make sure the poor performance was not due to a ""compatibility"" issue between the Sony earphones and the RIO player, I tried the earphones on all of my portable listening devices (including an older Sony Walkman)and found that the Sony earphones performed poorly in all cases.If you are just looking for comfortable set of earphones with a nice long cord, these will do fine, but if you want better sound quality, look elsewhere"
1,Not Good For Mobility,"I bought these and the wire leading to the left bud started coming apart. The rubber/plastic tubing around the actual wires started to get little slits in them. Then they came apart completely leaving the wires completely exposed. I thought maybe it was me being too rough on them, so I bought another pair. Same thing. Also, the wire that comes up to your head splits strangely leaving the left side WAY shorter than the right which puts the little splitter piece hanging off the left side of your face instead of under your chin - strange."
3,"Great sound , til the earwax comes along...","I've had these a month, and this morning the right ear peice, (the long cord) stopped working.When I googled the problem, I found out the little hole in the middle gets clogged with ear wax. So, I cleaned it with a needle and it works fine."
1,poor construction,"At first they were great. Great sound and even a cool little spool for shortening the line. Little disappointed at first because I didn't get a case with mine. Anyway, after a couple of weeks the insulation started wearing and wires were exposed. Sony is a trusted name and I'm truly disappointed at the poor quality. Save up your money and buy a good set of earphones that won't fall apart after a few weeks. Unfortunately for me, I lost my receipt and cannot return mine. Live and learn. Bad job, Sony!"
3,great...until the warranty expires....,"The headphones sound alright. Bass response is pretty impressive coming from a canalphone. Isolation is decent. It's pretty comfortable if you wear for an extended period of time. However, the durability on this is horrible. About 2 months after the warranty expired, the left earbud produced no sound. The price to do an exchange for a refurbished pair? 28 bucks. Yes, they sound good, but if these headphones are going to last less than half a year, better choose something else."
2,"great cans, _terrible_ cord","Let me get this out of the way, the sound is great and the isolation is wonderful.That said, the cord is bad enough to make them all but unusable. It seems to be designed to pull the left earbud out of your ear, then the right (it's intentionally asymetrical). With the included extension it's way too long (and heavy at the join), without it, it's too short. The cord that goes from ear to ear is way too long and gets caught in things.5 stars for the part that goes in your ears, 0 for the cord. It depresses me that they got the hard part right and then snatched defeat from the jaws of victory..."
2,"Nice sound, disappointing durablity","Enjoyed these for the brief period that they functioned -- after less than three months of gentle, once-a-week use, the right earbud quit. The sound is good, and the styling okay -- but I only got about 15-20 hours of use from them!"
3,only for loud places,"when you listen to them in a quiet room they're extremely muddy.but when you're walking around downtown, with trucks driving by, people talking on cell phones, music blaring on the streets, they're great. they block out enough noise to let you hear the music, but they let in enough sound so you'll be able to hear a car before it runs you over."
2,"Good headphones, terrible cord, zero customer service","I bought these after trying a friend's. When I got them, the sound difference from the APPLE earbuds was absolutely tremendous and I was 100% satisfied. Price to quality ratio was great. Then after a couple months I noticed that the rubber casing began to wear in certain places and then deteriorate and peel off entirely. This spread throughout the length of the headphones, exposing wire and leaving a black residue when I touched it. Apparently this is not unusual for this product. So i called big powerful Sony, thinking they would stand behind their product. The best they could do??? For another 30 bucks they would send me a refurbished comparable set. I laughed in the ""service"" reps ear and asked for a complaint form. I bought electrical tape and have been making bandages since. I'd like new Sony's but don't' trust them anymore. Might need to splurge for some Shurs."
2,Sound is good; wiring won't last,"I bought these headphones about 4 months ago, and while the sound is good, the insulation around the wires suddenly started peeling off like so much silly putty. I won't be buying Sony headphones again."
1,broke 2 weeks after purchase,"I bought a pair of these earphones and they simply stopped playing sound out of one earpiece two weeks later.A call to Sony was of course a waste of time, as it can take hours to get through their support process, and at the end of it all you get someone who can't/won't help you.I've had enough of Sony, never buying their crap again."
5,Best earbud with accessible price!,"Wonderful!!I read a lot of reviews before choosing these ones, and I'm writing this review, because all the other helped me choose this one.One difference from most of the other users is that I don't use it for MP3 Player, I just bought to use at work, plugged in my notebook, and it's small... if wasn't the wires no one would notice you are listening to some sound... only when they try to talk to you, because it really eliminates any external sound... and your ears are only for the clear sound that comes from it... the bass is amazing... I got surprise how such a small phone would give a good bass... and 70% of the music I listed is eletronic music... that has a lot of bass!!!!Already indicated to other friends that bought, and also loved... it's the best one you can get without spending more than US$150,00... great buy... and it's a SONY!!!"
4,Great for Sony portables!!!!,"For everyone out there with a sony cd-player or Minidisc player, my best advice is to find these headphones and purchase them. I have read some reviews that their bass is too heavy, but that's only when you get greedy and turn the bass up to 'bass 2.' These headphones naturally produce bass, similar to the Bose TriPort headset.The reason these headphones are at the top of my list is for the simple reason that I own a MZ-N10, and the headphones are the proper length for cd players/minidisc players with remotes. Kudos to Sony for thinking about us, and realizing that the headphones equipped with their top-end portable models aren't that good, and need upgrading as soon as you buy them."
2,Wire insulation problems,"I used these headphones walking around campus and at the gym. The wire insulation around the long wire that goes behind the neck started to get really soft and pliable and eventually fell off. Some other people had been having the same problems. The older models have a different type of coating, but the newer ones that I bought didn't last that long."
3,These stay in!!!,"Standard mp3 earbugs don't stay in my ears. I wanted something that was small and compact (can be worn under a motorcycle helmet), and would never fall out. A previous reviewee said they could not run with these in. I do not think they fitted them properly. They have three ear canal sizing adapters that are very soft and comfortable silicon. I'm a six foot tall male and needed the smallest size. They should fit way up into the ear canal like a rubber ear-plug. Once I have them in, no amount of running, jumping or any movement can make them fall out.The only negative is the sound is so so. Not bad, but not audiophile by any measure.Overall, I am very pleased."
3,Does not stay in ear,Tried this while running. The ear piece kept on falling out. The sound is not as good as the Ipod earphones. Would not recommend for excercising. The earpods were not comfortable.
4,Sony MDR-EX71SL earbuds,I found that these earbuds sound very good. The cord is a little of a problem keeping untangled. But I think you have that problem with most earbuds. Otherwise they are very comfortable. Just hope they are durable because I did not have them very long yet. But I use them every single day.
5,you will not believe your ears,"These ear bud type phones, are ultra amazing.Just look at the frequency response, it is better than alot of top end stereo speakers.Why ?, do they sound so amazing: because they also reproduce them with total acuracy.You will hear detail, that will scare you. The sounds are super crisp, clear, and no detectable harmonic distortion full blast.Bass is perfect, it you find fault with the bass on these phones,it because you have learned to like sloppy, off angle bass frequencies, which boom, and you think wow the bass the bass.Try a new airport.I shot myself in foot, paid 49.00 retail. But they as you can guess worth it.Yes I do agree fixed ear bud cord length is a quirky, BUT THAT IS WHAT MADE SONY FAMOUS, they focus on the technical, but have no street wise sarcasm, if you know what I mean.You will not find anything to beat these.They are a steal.Do you self a FLAVOR buy them, how often DO YOU GET MORE FOR YOUR MONEY then you expected.Gary"
3,Would not buy again.,the quality is not there. The headphones I received with my unit are better than these. I do not recommend them.
3,Back to my old earphones,"I have read a lot about how uncomfortable this is but I still did go ahead and buy. The earphone are not at all comfortable. After two hours of using it you'll feel your ears are sweaty coz no air is passing through. The extension cord design is pretty lame since you'll be needing it most of the time because the base cord is too short. Volume is too low. I set the volume in my mp3 player twice I used to when using this. Thus my battery drains faster. If you can keep up with all the above, the sound is great and I have no qualms about it."
2,Good Sound/Bad Design,"I bought these headphones in early 2004 and have wanted to write a review since I got them. This morning, I lost a final rubber ear bud cover leaving me with just the other one rendering the headphones useless... I think the set came with 6 rubber bud covers of various sizes and 5 of them came off either taking my ipod out of my bag or pocket. Besides that, the cord is too long and the piece that connects the long cord to the short cord makes it awkward to walk and bike with because of its weight. I don't understand why they even have this option of different lengths because the short cord connected to the ear buds is way to short to use alone. I would not buy this product again but would be interested on where I can get new rubber ear bud covers."
2,I returned them,"I bought these for gym use with my MP3 player, but I really didn't like them and have returned them. Bass was strong, almost overpowering. Midrange seemed quiet by comparison. Upper ranges were kind of tinny sounding to my (non-audiophile) ear.They were comfortable to wear sitting still, but the weight of the plug, combined with workout sweat, made the left phone keep losing its seal. The cord was strongly microphonic - I couldn't stand using it on the eliptical trainer without weaving the cord down my back under my shirt to keep it from bouncing around.I know these are inexpensive phones, but their quality pales in comparison to my over-the-ear open Sennheiser PX-100s, which cost just a bit more."
2,Not as good as others say,"Decent Bass, very limited high range, distorted midrange.Did improve as time when on, but not that great as others describe.better than my existing in ear headphone.Full size headphones used are sony MDR-V6, not even close to these headphones.Very stupid short cord, too short for any device or person.Excellent noise reductionIf you accidently yank out an earpiece, it is a very painfull event."
1,Worst deal. I bought headset and they send me bug buster,"Pls do not buy any item from this vendor as they have sent me wrong item with correct receipt. in spite of mentioning them to refund the shipping charges, they have not returned the money. I had to pay for shipping and return charges from my pocket and tons of stress."
4,Best bang for the BUCK!,"I stop using my iPOD earphone and I started using these instead. I haven't even looked for my Ipod ear buds for monthes. GO SONY! For comfort and sound quality, these are unbeatable for under $100! I do prefer my $300 BOSE headphones, but that is another story..."
2,They were great until they died young,"When I got my ipod, I found the Apple earbuds to be very uncomfortable and they had poor quality sound--especially on the bass end. I upgraded to the Fontopia earbuds, and I loved them. The earbuds were very comfortable (except for the weird asymmetrical cord), and the sound was wonderful. The Fontopias had clear, crisp, full-range response.Alas...after only five months--a full 60 days after the lame 90-day warranty expired, the earbuds lost all sound in the left side. I jiggled the cord and sound was temporarily restored, albeit with static and distortion. For what these cost five months ago, which was about twice what they go for now, I am very disappointed and more than a little ticked off that they died after just a few months--especially because I only use them at home when I read in bed at night. That's hardly serious wear-and-tear. Time to shop for something new and it won't be a Sony product."
1,"Great Sound, Awful durability!","The sound is great as it is described in the other reviews - but that's not the problem. The plastic encasing for the wires literally started to deteriorate on mine after about 2 months. I found out one of my co-workers had the same problem with the same product, and she had contacted Sony's customer service - where she was told that they would fix it for 30 bucks. That's more than what I paid for them brand new here on Amazon. I was listening to my iPod with my earphone wires completely exposed like some industrial high-tech design until I found a spray-on plastic coating to take care of the poor vulnerable wires. I only decided to write this review since I wasn't the only one with the same problem. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND this product until Sony fixes the problem. 30 Bucks!? Get real, Sonny."
2,Lousy Quality,"i purchased these headphones because i thought that being a SONY product, it would be of high quality. i have a DELL Jukebox MP3 player that has a 1-20 volume range. I usually have my volume at the 17 level, and after about a week of use, the left head phone is busted. it sounds like it has been blown out, and when i shake the headphone to see if something is loose, i can definately hear something moving around in it while the right headphone is solid. So..., i am very dissapointed. they ran me about $25, and i am not a happy camper."
4,SO FAR SO GOOD :) REMEMBER TO GET THE EXTRA WARRENTY,"Well, i read a ton of the reviews before i choose these. I have owned them for about 7 hours, 5 of them i was at work. Well as i listen to them, they do sound pretty darn good. But they are funny to fit in the ear. I am not sure if any of the included sizes really fit my ears. But the bass is there, if you get them in your ears correctly and they do sound good. I hope they just stay comfortable. It feels like the inside of my ears are almost being pressured a bit, not completely comfortable, but the bass does sound good now. Also, as i know they will die after a few months, i went and got the 5 dollar insurance on them. So after my 3 months of warrenty is gone, and they break, as i am guessing they will break, so i am covered."
1,Dont buy it.,Yes.. its Sony but still not worth it.We buy things for practical use and this is not designed with that in mind.Sound is pretty ok for the price but its almost impossible to use it in practical life.The cord is too short or too long. There is no choice but to use the extension wire and then the wire becomes so long that you got to tie it with Sony's new mechanism but then the headphone falls down every few minutes due to weight. Aaah ..The case given with the earphones is a joke. I just can't fit the entire earphone with the extension cord in it.Consider buying the lower version 51LP model. You will save $5. You just wont get that stupid case. I think that model comes with regular length wire.I have used it for a month and fed up.I am shocked and surprised Sony delivers such product !!
2,Good sound but BROKE after only three months.,I only use these earphone while sitting at my desk at work crunching numbers. No movement and these the right earbud just stopped working after about 3 months. Not acceptable at all since these things have never been strained at all....buyer beware.
1,"Great sound, terrible craftsmanship! Avoid.","Bought these and within three months, the rubber rotted away exposing the wiring and the sound went away in the left ear. Definite quality issues with this one. Do avoid.*I wrote a kinder, gentler review for this emphasizing the issues, but it wasn't accepted. Perhaps this one will be."
2,Great Sound but terrible cord quality,"I've gone through two pairs of these in about an 8 month period. I loved my first pair but within a couple months, the cord disintigrated to the point where the wires were exposed in a couple places. I thought I just had bad luck and bought another pair, THE SAME THING HAPPENDED. I held on as long as possible to buying a new pair of earbuds by trying to tape up the exposed wires, but they kept breaking. They are great buds, crisp clear sound great bass for earbuds, but the cord quality is miserable. Save yourself the hassle and money of having to buy a new pair every couple months and look at the Sennheiser CX 300. They sound better, look better, and are constructed MUCH better."
2,Not good for active people,"When I had read all of the reviews of these headphones I was pretty excited to try them out. When I opened them up and listened to them sitting at home they sounded great! Then I went for a jog.......a totally different story. Once the earphones are in place they do a great job of cancelling out sound but any movement of the cord at all (bumping against your shirt while running) transmits the sound directly to your ears. Anybody who has used a stethoscope will know what I'm talking about. While running (even walking) you hear this constant loud bumping sound being transmitted to your ears. I cannot believe that I haven't heard this mentioned before, its pretty significant. For sitting at home their great but if you plan on moving your body at all, forget it."
2,"If you exercise, this is not for you!!","Great sound, but the cord is too short, even if you use an MP3 player on an armband. If you turn your head while exercising, you will pull the left ear bud right out. The right one has a longer cord and will hold. They do give you an extension cord, but it is too long and the connection point is too heavy. The excess weight will also pull on the earbuds and the left one (with the shortest slack) will come out. On a five-mile ride/run I had to readjust this set several times. If not for the amazing sound, I would have given this product just one star. It would be a good set of headphones if you listen to music while lounging indoors."
2,Not good as headphones,"Sorry, but if you are looking for straight up headphones go get some jbuds. The cord on these are way too long and I simply wasnt a fan of the product all around."
3,Decent product but overpriced,Headphones are OK in every aspect but just OK. the chord is a bit too short and the extension is too long but that's a minor annoyance. i've had these for a few years and they still work OK.
2,Great until it breaks,"This pair of headphones is great for using with an iPod remote. My left bud broke after less than one year with very careful use (I always used the case and placed the headphones in a padded pocket). After problems like that, I don't think I'll buy another pair as a replacement."
