4,"does the job, but awkward set up","This dryer works fine once it's set up. I find the set up process a bit awkward, as well as folding it back up. I was expecting it to somehow pop open and snap back together in a quick step. But, it's a little more of a hassle than that. However, once it's set up, it works as expected and the drying area is large enough to accomodate long sleeve sweaters. I do like that it has a hook for hanging/storing."
1,won't fold up!,"I have dried sweaters on this, although it won't fit in my bathtub and it WON'T fold up! I've struggled and struggled to get this thing folded, to put it back in the box. It won't budge. TIRESOME!"
4,Good way to dry sweaters!,Good way to dry sweaters! I like that it can be hung up when not in use! Worth the money!
1,Get Organized Stackable Sweater Drying Racks,"Total junk. When I returned it, Get Organized claimed they never recieved my package. I've been shopping on-line for years now and have never experienced such lousy quality and service."
2,Expectatations vs reality,"The device illustrated on the website had stacked three of these and had a price next to the devices. Low and behold what came was ONE rack. I pointed out the difference and all hell broke lose! Money returned, apoligies, agast reactions akin to the loss of a child. After a little dust setteling I suggested that I didn't want my money back --just what was presented. The two additional racks arrived. MY credit card bill looks like someone had a fit of credits and charges. You have become so automated you've lost your common sense. The reason I don't shop on line, as much, is the cahos that results when things don't go as planned. A little less hysteria and more human cognitive ability would improve the whole damned system. I have little hope this note will do any good which is proof that I too have become loopy using the system.Goodbye!"
2,Stopped working after 5 months,"This trimmer was great while it lasted. Unfortunately, it stopped working completely after only 5 months. Not sure why, never dropped it. It was stored in the medicine cabinet."
5,Not just for people,"This handy little trimmer is perfect for trimming around my dogs eyes, ears and pads. Much safer than scissors. Very easy to use, reasonably quiet and very lightweight. If I still had my horses, this would have been perfect to take to shows to do last minute trimming.Great tool and Amazon has the best price I have seen."
4,ouch where did those muscles come from,"i have been working with weights for 4 years. trying diversity i was told will increase your muscle tone. this is true. when i did the bootcamp videos this week, i felt muscles worked at a different angle was much more intense. it was good to feel the musles work. it was an excellent team of three that complimented eachother. they are fun and i loved the little comments througout the video (lois lanes and supermans). it was a workout at a great pace for beginners and advanced people. the pace was perfect. thanks again"
4,Sultans of Swing - DVD,"Great tracks ... but really old videos (however, some were interesting) ... Bottom line: you can't go wrong with Mark and friends."
3,old mixed Dire.,"First of all I like music concerts or live recordings.From this point I can say it's not the best Dire Straits DVD. It has no unity, it's like several Videos placed together on a DVD. Some of them are Recorded Live and some others are the videos I used to watch on MTV...No subtitles!! They are just for the main menu."
2,Not very impressed,First clip was a lip sinc disaster. All had instruments playing on stage to the studio recording.The next set wasnt much better.2nd was live footage with studio recording mixed in with obvious timing mishaps. Other clips were basic MTV type videos and other bad retake sing alongs.Great Music but not for sitting down to watch and enjoy.Better off buying the music CD and having cartoons on the TV with the TV volume off.
1,sultan swing,"I purchased a sultan swing dvd last month. I didn't enjoyed the dvd, I expect this item is dvd concert but It looks like a mtv. I regret what I saw on dvd."
3,Already released under a different name,"I have a VHS entitled ""Dire Straits - The Videos"", released by Warner Reprise Videos in 1992.This DVD appears to be the exact same collection of videos released under the guise of a new product. That would explain the lack of features that one would normally associate with a DVD -- it's a direct port of the VHS.There are still 3 good reasons to get this DVD: 1)It's better quality and will last longer than VHS, 2) The VHS is probably very hard to get a hold of, and 3) It's Dire Straits.A five-star collection of videos, but it loses a couple stars for trying to trick us and for the stripped-down features and presentation (when compared to other DVDs in the genre)."
3,Wanted CD,"This was my own fault, I didn't pay enough attention and ordered a DVD instead of a CD. I went back and looked when I received the DVD and that's what I ordered. It was priced like a CD."
3,Old MTV videos,Just not interesting. Look for live Dire Straights or Mark Knofler stuff. These videos are simply 1st or 2nd gen MTV things.
1,An ideal book for people who hate men and think sex is evil.,"If you think that all heterosexual sex is rape, if you think that male-female relations are necessarily unequal and unjust, if you think that hyperfeminist extremism has higher value than the First Amendment -- if, in short, you're nuts, you'll love this book. The authors express these bizarre sentiments. People who live in the real world would be better off reading something else."
5,"""Fool"" is a must for anyone with an imagination","Fool on the Hill is a book that I wish I had written. I haven't been this excited about a piece of literature since I finished the last Tom Robbins. ""Fool"" has a magnetism, a humor, and a magic that few books can claim. Ruff is a quality writer with a unique sense of reality, and if I could live in a book, I would choose ""Fool"". Beautifully crafted, ""Fool"" takes inspiration from all the great writings through time, and contains a perfect mixture of fantasy, fun, and beauty. It will cast a spell on you."
5,You don't have to be a Cornellian.,"You don't have to be a Cornellian to enjoy this book, although it does help. Ruff has a unique writing voice that he uses to give life to a band of characters that is quite divergent from your average band of heroes and villains. Without falling into the traps of many modern fairytales (such as pointless angst and overwrought raw emotion), he manages to create an intriguing tale based in world that is real but... a little off. You get it all in this book; love, violence, drink recipes, and references to obscure works of modern fiction. And best of all, both Ithaca and Cornell really exist, so if you have never been there, you can visit and see how the reality matches the vivid picture that Ruff draws in your mind."
5,Liquid dream on paper,"Cornell, yeay!I love this book. Had the wonderful chance to read it on The Hill in summer time. It is the closest thing on paper to a Sunday walk in lalaland. Borges, Hemingway, Hesse all rolled into one.Highly recommended to anyone who likes to dream."
4,"Enchanting, sweet, funny",Searching for a book that will enchant and uplift without being sappy or trite? Give this one a try. A sweet story with great characters that you can truly care about. A bit of the fantastic mixed in with the modern world. This book is written with a sense of humor and wonder.
4,Fun Reading!,"What a lucky find this book was! A fun combination of college life with a bit of fantasy wrapped into the story. It stirred some of my own college memories, but my college life was NOTHING like this. It was a wonderful break from my normal mystery and science fiction. Great and easy reading."
2,overrated,"I forced myself through this book in the hopes that it would get better. All I got was a sense of the author's smugness and self-satisfaction, a bunch of two-dimensional characters and predictable situations, and the constant message that Cornell University is the center of the universe (even though, curiously, the author never takes us into a single classroom or shows anyone studying). NOT RECOMMENDED."
4,Too Fantastic,"I grew up in Ithaca for 4 years of my life, and have always been a great fan of the Beatles, which is why I picked this book up in the first place. I read it, and loved it, especially noting mentions of places I had visited, some of which were literally around the corner from my house. Somewhere in the first few chapters, it tells of George's land-lord's reaction to his book ""Too fantastic and too much profanity"". When I first read that, I thought they meant too fantastic as in too wonderful, which I later realized was a mistake on my part, but if George's book is as good as Fool on the Hill, it is too fantastic as in far too wonderful!"
1,Vapid. Juvenile. Amatuerish. And unforgivably boring.,"I do not understand why so many people love this book. I'm guessing that many reviewers read it while in college, and have fond memories of those days. One reviewer, however, noted that it was written while Ruff was still a student. This does not surprise me at all. It reads like something a college student would write. The author seems unaware that there is Life beyond College (not to mention how trite it is to start Nouns with captial Letters for effect). There are so many other great fantasy novels out there, I've decided to donate this one to the library. Suggested reading: ""Little, Big"" by John Crowley. You want sprites and fairies and normal people? Read this one. I will now step down off my cyber-soapbox."
3,All Dogs Go to Heaven,"If you liked Disney's ""All Dogs Go to Heaven"", you may like this. It just didn't work for me. Much better reads of the same genre include ""Faerie Tale"" or even ""The Good Fairies of New York""... I don't remember the authors.""Set This House in Order"", also by Ruff, is one of the most beautiful stories I have ever read. I love that book and pass it along often to anyone who expresses an interest. Having enjoyed ""STHIO"" so much, I searched Amazon to find another good novel by this wonderful author. Unfortunately, this book is just mediocre."
5,Referential Literary Humor and Action,"This novel is nothing less than unique. First off, it must be said that much of Matt Ruff's humor is made through direct and indirect literary references. That being said, one does not have to be an obsessively read literati to enjoy this book. It also has great chararcter development, broad physical humor, and engaging action.Everyone I have recommended this book to has torn through it in a short period of time. The action sequences are vivid, and vilolent, with well developed characters (that you will care about) being put in harm's way."
2,Waste of time,"I just finished reading this book and was tremendously disappointed. I kept with it, thinking it would get better, and now wish I had put it down like previous reviewers had. I cannot recommend this book. Don't waste your time."
4,Good romp of a book,"I read this one while on vacation. It draws you in a bit with some warm fuzzies, so it's a good plane/beach book. Not a book to change your life -- but then again, ploughing through those ones sometimes aren't worth the trouble."
4,One of my favorite books,"I've read it maybe 5 times, and this number will probably increase with the years: it's fresh, entertaining without being shallow, and very imaginative. Ruff has a very easy-going but very precise use of language, and that makes it even more enjoyable to me.A LOT of characters to keep track of, but worth the effort as it comes together.Still love this book!"
2,Not as described,"I ordered this for Christmas so my daughter has not played with it yet. It seems durable. The DESCRIPTION says posable arms & legs; not the case, it has posable arms but not the legs! Plus the reason I choose this item was because all the other pink panthers I saw had loops attached to the top of the head & I DIDN'T want that. The picture never shows this or says it in the description but It came like that. I tried to contact the company but haven't been able to because the email doesn't go through plus it wasn't showing in my ""order"" so I guess I am stuck with an item I am NOT fully happy with. I would never purchase from this person/shop again!"
4,Good,"I've had my Archos Jukebox player for a year now. I got it last year (...).It is not as sleek or easy to use as most other players, but it plays music, stores files and records live very well. Sometimes it turns off without warning or freezes, but very rarely and only when the battery is low.It's worth every dollar of what it costs."
2,good but not good enoughf,"I bought my Archos 20 GB jukebox recorder about 7 months ago. At first I loved it but I noticed right off that the headphone jack was not of top quality. Any time the headphone plug was wiggled even the slightest bit it creates a horible static and now you can only hear sound coming out of one terminal(left speaker). This is a great divise to use as an external hard drive but it lacks greatly in the playback area. Recording is great it can pick up just about anything in a roon and for as long as you want, very clear. It starts up much quicker that previous Archos JB's. some people have the problem with portability and battery life. I solved that problem by buying a alternate power source that i could use with 4 AA batterys. I took mine and traveled all over asia with it and over all it heald up prity will. I am giving it two stars because at this point the audio jack is failing and only after 7 months. Bummer, but now usless for audio."
2,Stay Away,"I really did not want to believe all the negative things about the Archos jukebox, and now I'm paying the price. Do not make the same mistake! The product is good but with one major flaw, durability. You might end up getting a good unit and praising it but that is the less likely scenario. Mine went bad in a week and Archos technical support is hands down the rudest, least qualified and least helpful technical department I have ever had the misfortune of calling. Consider yourself lucky if you end up with a good unit and if not return to Amazon within the 30 days period, do not even bother with Archos for repairs. Two stars since there is some chance you will get a good unit, just don't count on it."
1,0 stars would be better,"Recieved this as a gift, and wow does it suck. My computer doesn't recognize it, the manual included is useless, and it charged for more than 24 hours, and still isn't completely charged. The display shuts off after 5 seconds. This is going right back where it came from, and I'm using the credit to buy an iPod."
1,"DOES NOT WORK WITH WIN 98 , WIN 2000 and WIN XP","I bought the Archos 20 GB USB 2.0 MP3 Jukebox Recorder for its good value and features..I was disappointed because it did not deliver on its promise - it was not plug and play on my laptop (Win 98 SE) nor with my 2 desktops (Win 2000 and Win XP).. I downloaded the preinstall drivers from archos.com and was successful in loading the correct drivers but still got the error 'Device could not be started (Error 10)""."
1,Super Mega angry pants.,"If I could give this 0 stars I wouldI used this all of 5 times before it stopped working. I didn't confuse adapters or drop it down a well. It just stopped turning on.Call to get it replaced, wasted $8 in shipping to ship it back. Archos wanted $80 to fix it EVEN THOUGH IT WAS UNDER WARRANTY because I uploaded the roxbox software in place of their inferior software. I know, I know. Read your warranty info... it's void if you alter the software. Still- stabby at Archos for a poorly made product."
1,Poor Quality and Poor Customer Service,"If you get a unit that works you may be lucky; if you don't, beware. I bought this Archos unit for a friend. It didn't work properly when received so he called Customer Support. During the 18 months he has had the unit, he has sent it back 4 times for repair and it still doesn't work correctly. Initially Archos wanted him to pay for the repair! Each time they required him to mail in the unit with the charger; last time they returned only the unit without the charger. Clearly, Archos Customer Support has problems. Think twice before buying any product from this company."
1,Stopped working after few days...,It was having this small little glitches from the beginning and It stopped working after few days completely.
4,Good solid Mp3 harddrive/Player,"Been using this for a week, and it smokes. Bought it for my car. Any cassette to 1/8 jack will work. It is easy to understand and navigate. Like most men, I did not read the directions and started playing with the buttons and it made absolute sense. If you have windows ME or above, no drivers required just plug it in and A instant drive letter appears. Use the sendto from your right click (that is the easiest way to copy songs to the drive) The headpone design is perfect, although with many other players, it is not the best sounding but pretty good. I'm picky about my sound so a eq would have been nice, but did well without it. And comes with nice pouch to put the player in. Battery life 6 to 8 hours. Very nice."
1,Unreliable product - difficult to contact service department,"My son received this MP3 player for Christmas last year. Within 6 weeks the hard drive had completely crashed and you couldn't even turn the unit on. The Archos customer service department does not have an 800 number. I had to call at my expense several times, once being on hold for over 40 minutes in order to get an RMA number. They did replace the unit. However, seven months later the unit has crashed again. My son's best friend received the same model for Christmas last year also, and it also has been sent back more than once. I won't be spending any more money on Archos products."
1,Stay away,"If your plans are to sit in a lounge chair and listen to MP3's then this is the item for you. If you plan to do any type of physical activity that might cause the Jukebox to be less than stable, then you want to consider anything but this. I have had it for a few months and am looking for any brand (never Archos again) to replace it. I understand that it has a 20 g harddrive, but I see IPOD users all the time wearing theirs while power walking, jogging etc.. If this thing even bounces once, it locks up.So, if you want somethinglisten to while sitting, by all means buy it. Otherwise, you are just pouring money down the drain."
1,Amazon Customer Service Lacks and So Does This MP3 Player,"Do NOT buy this player. It started acting up after a couple of weeks and totally died within a month. Amazon insulted me and gave me a hard time about getting a new one. They asked if I read the manual. The piece of junk did not even turn on after working for a couple of weeks. I would press the on button, the lights would go on, get a flash and it would turn off. This even occurred when plugged into AC current."
1,After Sales Service,I bought an Archos product over a year ago and it has now malfunctioned. When I approached the shop were I bought the product I was informed that Archos did not support any product of this type for more than a year. Despite numerous emails over many weeks I have not had any reply from Archos direct. The moral would seem to be if the Archos product you want is worth the money for 1 years use... great but if you want it to last more than 1 year beware.
1,No use of buying it.,"I bought this and had lot of problems. Initially I had a problem with the battery. I got the unit replaced. The replacement is also not good. The player freezed while using the controls. After this happens, you have to just wait for the player to shut down. The manual given along with the player is not that useful either. I wanted to change the battery myself but couldn't using the manaul. The reason i bought this unit over other MP3 players was because of price. But going thru all the troubles, i don't think this is worth the trouble."
1,Don't Do It,"I own of these units and my advice is don't do it. They are very poorly made and when mine (like many other people's) went wrong the after sales service is non-exsistant. The menus system is very basic and very annoying, you can't scroll through the songs whilst playing another, the software provided is feeble and unreliable. Do yourself a favour and get an Ipod..."
1,Don't even think about it,"I bought one of these for my kid at Christmas 2002. She still has yet to get more than a couple of months' use out of it. I am in the process of trying to get yet another replacement (that will be No. 3) out of Archos. The unit stops responding to any commands and does not seem to have power. They all did the same thing. I found Archos customer support OK, they did deal with me and answer my questions. It took months to get a replacement unit. But so what ... get an iPod."
1,Piece of Junk!,"Ordered the first Archos jukebox recorder beginning of Feb 2004. It came with the Orange V2 sticker and a nice sealed box. I Attempted to charge it, yet after 14 hours it failed to complete the charge, and failed to turn on. Per Archos tech support it was defective. Amazon cheerfully replaced it with a second unit Feb 25, 2004. This one came with a white V2 sticker, and a carry case that was not in the first package. Plugged in the charger and it cycles on and off - failing to charge. Again, Archos tech support feels it is defective. This one goes back for a refund. I've had enough of Archos.Based on my experiences, and the fact you cannot replace the battery on this unit, I do not recommend this player to anyone! The quality control at Archos has become attrocious! Nobody should randomly recieve two defective units in a row!"
3,No good,It worked OK for about 20 days and took a dump. There is a problem with these units.Thankfully Amazon took it back without a complaint.Thanks Amazon!
5,"GREAT PRODUCT, GREAT PRICE!","(...) I must admit the operating system that came with the Archos Jukebox Recorder was not the easiest to use. The Rockbox made this MP3 player easy to use without the need to read the instructions! The sound is excellent when playing MP3s, as is the recording function. Rockbox comes with a number of games and screensavers, that makes this product much more versitile! So far I've had no problems with the battery life, the headphones that it comes with aren't the greatest either. Its worth it!"
5,I wish I had more time to listen to music!,"Listening to the other reviewers, I used the rockbox flash. Much improved, but the controls are still difficult to learn, as this is my first portable MP3 player. It is a great price for a usb 2.0 device with a 20GB drive. In addition to storing MP3s, I've used it as a portable HDD, as well!!!It's not much to look at and sure makes it's presence felt, but it sure is worth it!"
1,poor quality,"I bought this mp3 from amazon.com, after fully charged, when I am trying to listen mp3 song, the mp3 was dead. Any button does not work, the LCD shows error message ""panic -7"". Then, I asked for exchangement. when I got the second mp3, similar problem occurred again. But, this time error message shows that ""File System Error, No valid FAT16/32 Found""."
3,Not quite 'top quality',"This device is the best comercially available device for on location recodings to MP3 format. However, anybody who really cares about quality sound will want to record to an uncompressed audio format, such as SDII or AIFF, which this device can't do.This is way better than the iPod, which with an extra device, can record mono, but still a far cry from 'top quality audio.'"
5,Reliable and Powerful,"Great mp3 player. With the firmware from www.rockbox.org, you can watch videos, play games and do many other things. I have had it for a year, and works just like the day i got it. It can do more than an ipod, and though it may be bigger, it makes up for it in power. I have friends with ipods and dell djs, and they are amazed at what this can do."
2,Buyer's Regret: Should have gotten an iPod Mini...,"For a 20GB MP3 player, Archos has the best price. I'd rather pay more for the iPOD mini though, after receiving my Archos. The iPod Mini is so much better looking, and of better quality.This 20GB Archos' MP3 player is probably one of the first MP3 products from Archos. The design was rather immature, and quality poor. In the 2 days after I received this item, I have found many things not working (mostly related to the firmware). It needs better QA.In addition, the look and feel can be better, as is already reflected in some of Archos' newer products. The unit I have was very heavy, and it looks cheap. Everyone wants to by inexpensive products, but no one want one that looks cheap.I want something that I can feel happy seeing it everyday I use it, and feel proud when I use it in front of others. That's certainly not this Archos player. I'll get an iPod mini. That's cool..."
3,I've had the JBMM 20 for a long time....,"This is the 20, not the 20SE, the SE has a slightly better design, so I won't go into detail about the shortcomings of the 20, which lacks the refinements.What is common between them - and what I dislike - is the battery life. It's crap and I've had a hellish time trying to find a way to extend it. If you are able to charge it every night and won't use it more than a few hours at a time then you'll probably be fine.The capacity is great, with Win2k / XP it's happily seen as another drive - you can make folders and just drag and drop into them. I use it almost exclusively for listening to audio books and generally have 10 to 20 on it at any point in time.At the time of this writing the device costs $160 (After rebate). It's worth this cost, but not worth much more."
3,Good but loud hard drive,"Got this for 2 days now and works well like it is supposed to. Buttons are very sturdy. This version has a white circular sticker with ""Special Edition V2"" on it. Battery fully charged for the first time in about 4 hours even though the manual stated to charge it for a minimum of 6 hours.Connecting to the computer and transferring files is very easy on Windows XP using Windows Explorer.Here are my complaints about this:When hard drive is running, it makes a high pitch noise and makes this periodic clicking which sounds like a pencil lead lightly tapping on metal. When using it as a recorder for classroom lectures, it picks up these noises. The hard drive is not fast. It takes a while (about 2 seconds) to load a 3MB mp3 file. With it's 2MB built in memory it has to use the hard drive about 3 times per song.Overall not bad for the price. I worry about the durability with the drive head lightly hitting the metal sides."
2,A Xerox of a Xerox,I'm in the middle of this book and I'm impressed by the research and scholarship. Too bad the printing doesn't match. It looks like a photocopy of a photocopy several generations removed from the original. This is particulary disturbing given the high price of this paperback book.
1,A Random Walk Down Wall Street: The Time-Tested Strategy for Successful Investing (Completely Revised and Updated),I never received the updated book. I did receive the older edition with out of date information.Make sure you are getting the right book as our economy changes by day and night.
4,"A book too long for common individual investors, but great review for finance professionals","Written ostensibly for the individual investor, A Random Walk Down Wall Street is Burton Makliel's treatise on investing. Beginning with a rather interesting historical account of bubble markets, Malkiel proceeds to poke holes in the techniques and very profession of technical and fundamental analysts. His approach is well constructed and argued--compelling me to rethink my position on efficient-market theory. However, he paints a bleak and cynical picture of the investment profession that is outdated considering the current level of regulation and nascent generation of CFA and other certified professionals. The first half of the book is entertaining and intellectually stimulating, but the pace slackens in the second half, which often reads like a drab textbook on financial planning. That said, there are investing tips sprinkled throughout that make the laborious task of reading these sections worthwhile."
2,Random Walk is dead,"While the book is excellent and well written, random walk theory has been proven incorrect time and again. Academia now is shifting away from random walk. Professor Andrew Lo of MIT, for example, has done substantial work showing that technical analysis may be profitable. If the markets were random, this would not be possible. That said, this book was written before such work was available, and offers excellent insights. However, if you are looking for help in your trading and investing, try the technical analysis section."
1,ACADEMIC GARBAGE!,"I FIRST READ THIS BOOK IN COLLEGE DURING THE MID 70'S. I WAS AMAZED THAT SUCH GARBAGE COULD BE SOLD TO PEOPLE, SIMPLY BECAUSE OF TWO FACTORS; THE ACADEMIC CREDENTIALS OF THE AUTHOR, AND THE COMPLEXITY OF THE SUBJECT MATTER. IF YOU READ THIS BOOK, YOU MAY BE DENYING YOURSELF THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN SOME OF THE MOST VALUABLE KNOWLEDGE IN THE WORLD TODAY!"
2,I find it boring and not really helpful as an individual investor,"This book involves too much history to state how technical analyst and fundamentalist not able to do better than individual investor as in long term investment. Overstate how people not able to predict future and stock price, but never give enough suggestion or strategy an individual investor should take or not take. To many boring equations and charts. I have found some chapter interesting, but skipped many of them. I don't really recommend it."
1,a book to satisfy the lazy people,"The book suggest you should invest index instead of others. The author give a lot of Selective cases to show index fund outperform many fund or stock. Here are two important thing the author avoid to answer.1. When is best time to invest index. If you invest index on 1964, then you sell it on 1981. you almost get zero return for over 17 years.2. How long you should hold index investment. all samples seems about 30 to 40 years. If you have the patient for 30 years hold, you are already a winner.Also as another reviewer said, he put a very limited info about someone like buffet invest return.I hate the author hide so many important info which may against his theory. I dont believe he donot know.Leave this book alone, all information provided by this book are selected and only for support the author's theory.I do not know why so many people talk about it is a classic book and give five star."
4,Boy-This is a must read!,I highly recommend that you read Random Walk Down Wall Street before investing a dime in the market. This book is highly recommended by Wade Cook in his home study course and I agree.I also recommend Wall Street Money Machine #1 and How To Pick StocksLike Warren Buffett by Timothy Vick.
3,Derivatives...lol,"Overall a good book. The bit where he says ""it's highly unlikely derivatives will undermine the global economic system"" is funny in hindsight though. lol."
2,meh..,"This book is extremely biased. The efficient markets hypothesis is exactly what it states; a ""hypothesis"". There is no documentation/citation for proof of any of these ""studies"" that the author so often refers to. With that being said, I still found this book enjoyable to read and disagree with. The book does contain some useful and relevant information, and was definitely worth the read overall. If anyone would like some REAL information on this topic, Robert Shiller offers an in-depth lecture titled ""Efficient Markets"" through ""Open Yale""([...]), which can be accessed through the site posted here, or through YouTube."
4,"Useful, but too easy and basic","This book is a good start for students of finance and investments, however, it's too easy and, I would say, superficial. The language and the author's attutide are just wonderful though; I really enjoyed reading it just as a fun book. If you have already passed FIN 55whatever it's not going to help you in any way."
4,A Random Walk Down Wall Street,A basic primer for all levels of investor. Looks behind the curtain and uncovers the wizard(ery). Appropriate in good and bad times
1,the market is not random,"the market is not random at all. the academia knows nothing about the market. if the author gets into the real stock market, he will lose tons of money. that is why he would rather stay in the academia and write this gabage."
1,not a fan.,"This book was not what it was trumped up to be, as far as I am concerned. It's a gloomy, negative, pessimistic, unending drivel of known and common sense information and data presented in a much more complicated manner that they are in real life. After reading this book you may be inclined to start taking anti-depressants and definitely stay away from the stock and other securities markets. Weeooogh!!"
3,A good read. Lots of sharp ideas.,I'm a new investor who's trying to learn as much about Wall Street and the art of investing. This book uses terms and ideas I can live with.
1,Kindle edition is quite poor,"The book is otherwise fabulous, but you should steer clear of the Kindle version. The Kindle handles charts poorly, and this book has a lot of them. Some are manageable, but many others contain small text that is so blurry that it might as well be written in Arabic. Quite honestly, it is not entirely clear to me how Amazon gets away with selling this item. The Kindle is great, but Amazon absolutely should not sell books that cannot actually be read on it."
5,Pragmatic Advice,"Not only does this book present good pragmatic advice, but it backs up that advice with real facts and figures. Though some items are glossed over more than others, Malkiel gives a great comprehensive overview of his perspective regarding stock market investing."
3,Is Random Really Random?,"Malkiel never discusses how a market can be more efficient at times, and less efficient at other times. It is the skill (or art) to know the difference: There are Two University of Chicago Professors walking down the street when one looked down and saw a $100 bill on the sidewalk. When asked why he didn't pick up the $100 bill, the professor replied, ""It wasn't really there, if it was, someone would have already picked it up."""
2,Amusing Ivory Tower Jumble,"The classic layman's read on ""Efficient Market Hypothesis"" mumbo-jumbo. Towards the end, when Malkiel advised mutual fund investing and badmouthed ETFs, I checked his bio, and yup, turns out he's out of Vanguard. He's a mutual fund shill. Makes me think of the funny quote from Gordon Gekko in the movie Wall Street: ""Ya know why mutual fund managers can never beat the the S&P; 500? Cuz they're sheep, and sheep get slaughtered.""Read ""When Genius Failed"" by Roger Lowenstein to see how EMH disciples create havoc.This book is worth reading for aficionados, but only in a Sun Tzu kind of know-your-enemy way.The gushing reviews that Random Walk receives baffles all common sense."
5,Well researched!,"Combining research and commonsense the information in this book will save many potential investors from heavy losses.Based on my personal observation, having worked in one of the largest investment firms of its time, I see the wisdom in what Burton is presenting. My own strategy of buy and hold is working quite well. Adding the information provided by Burton will help me tweak what I've been doing thus far and more importantly, give me examples of what can happens more often when one ceases to work towards the long term gain for short term profit."
3,Mean spirited,"Some of the arguments in this book don't make much sense. It does give you an interesting historical perspective, but the author chooses poor examples to prove his points. I found a lot of the ""jokes"" to be mean spirited, sexist, and just not very funny."
2,Not what I imagined,"If you are a complete novice to investing and not a rocket scientist I think you will have trouble with much of this book. If on the other hand you are well schooled in Wall Street ways, then you will most likely be bored by this book.Technical traders will be put off by the attitude towards them. I agree with the underlying premise, that most people would be best served by Index fund investing over a long time frame. However the majority of those people can't follow his technical academic writing.A major issue that is hinted at slightly but never really discussed is that Wall Street is basically dishonest and slanted towards INSIDERS. The ones inside always make the lionshare of the money. Been there and done that!"
3,An interesting random walk...,This book helps to understand how the shares market works and its history.I think it may interest all people who wants to improve his knowleadge ininvesting.
4,Great delivery - good book,I got the book on time and faster than I expected it. It is a great boook so far.
3,A good piece of literature for the average Joe.,"""Markets look a lot less efficient from the banks of the Hudson than from the banks of the Charles"" - Fischer BlackBurton Malkiel does a very good job at marketing his book. It even has a catchy name in addition to his ""blunt"" comments. This book can be written by a freshman economics major at a community college near you, and you would not be able to tell the difference. It is, however, a good investment book for your blue collar worker. I just wish people from the financial industry would state their place of employment, job function, and level & area of education before posting a review on this site - it would save a few select individuals some money. Otherwise, good job Prof. Malkiel, you are making a living as any other academic."
4,Good if you are new to investing or just love reading about it,"I can not say that this book was a major eye opener but on the other hand, for many that have limited experience then it might be more insightful. There is a lot of disinformation and risk out there , especially to people that want to try day trading. I got hold of this in used from a friend and look forward to seeing new revisions. I have had my share of market pain. I certainly think it is worth the time and expense. If/ when you open an online brokerage account, there's always that section on disclaimers and responsibilities you much check before permitted to open the account."
1,Brittle and sticks to itself. What an ordeal.,"I bought some of this brand of tape to save some money compared to that other leading famous brand of clear sealing tape. What I got were rolls of tape that looked the same but were brittle. That means that the tape split as I was pulling it off the roll, making me pick at the strip still sticking to the roll and starting it over. I wasted so much time with this tape that I made up my mind to pay extra and buy that other leading brand that I never had this problem with.The only way I can qualify this review is that perhaps the rolls I got were too old to be sold. Perhaps they had been in storage too long. But after what I've been through using this tape, I can't bring myself to buy it again."
4,Microstation V8 for Autocad Users,"I have worked on both Microstation and Autocad since 1981. However,for the last 7 years I have been involed with Autocad only and this book supplied answers to questions that I had and brought me up to speed on the use of Microstation V8."
3,OK,"The book seems to have a lot of information, but it does not always make it clear what it is talking about. It could use more text driven images."
3,a very basic suit,"this is a good practice suit, very comfortable but if you are built big on top this is not the suit for you, wears well after many many daily swims in the pool but, not by any means, is this a conservative style swim suit"
3,Swimsuit,The size chart is wrong. I had to exchange the swimsiut after the purchase. This cost me $12 extra dollars which makes the price of this swimsuit outragous! The swimsuit is tight but works well in the water.
4,Order one size bigger!,This is a great suit for real swimming. My girls are into synchronized swimming and this suit provides good coverage while allowing for all the movements. I do wish I'd read the reviews to order a size larger than what my daughter wears as it does run small.
4,Lane 4,"No problems with this order. It shipped when they said it would and arrived timely. Considering the cost of swimsuits these days, I think I got a good bargain. Since I'm a bigger size, I was thankful that this swim shop offered my size without charging more."
4,Lane 4 Swim Suit,"I bought this swim suit for my daughter. The sizing runs a bit small, so if you normally wear a 30, order a 32. Other than that, the product is just fine."
3,"Adequate suit, but not for the curvy","The suit arrived promptly but is a bit skimpy for my curves. Good material/seamwork and makes for a good training suit, but definitely tailored for the leggier/leaner swimmer (runs a bit smaller than training suits by competitors and has a 'higher than high cut' on the buttocks) however, the price and the company are amazing. I would not purchase this suit again but have bought from this vendor again. They have an overall great selection of suits for various needs and prices."
3,good and bad,"These suits are great. Very well constructed and the fit is especially good if you have a long torso. However, they debit your account as soon as you order and then wait 30 days to ship the item. Ideally, they should ship immediately. But, if that is not possible, they should not take your money until they ship. This has given me a bad taste about an otherwise good product."
1,Lane 4 Solid Swimsuit,"I was unhappy with the suit because it did not provide any type of coverage for serious swimming. If you look at the picture, you'll notice that the model has a rather flat backside and a flat chest. I think if you are even slightly more endowed than the model, the suit will not provide adequate coverage for your top and backside.I returned the suit, and was amazed with the customer service from Lane 4. I was credited with my refund less than 48 hours after putting the suit in the mail. I would definitely do business with them again, but I would review the item I was purchasing very carefully before I purchased it."
4,Solid one-piece fitness swimsuit,Lane 4 SolidThis one-piece swimsuit fits snugly and does not absorb water to make it feel heavier. Lasts about a year with constant training use in chlorine pool. Is a solid deal for the price and durability. Consider ordering multiple quantities if lap swimming is your main fitness activity.
2,Tank suit,"It was too small, too tight, made ME look like a TANK. But I returned it and the company responded very politely. Sometimes one has to try things on~"
2,runs small,According to the chart I ordered an appropriate size. But it was too tight. I would die in public. It is nice and fully lined but I forgot to think about a built in bra. The suit was just what I expected except for the size. And now I will remember how important a built in bra is.
2,Bad fit!,"I don't like the fit at all. I was wearing Speedo prior to this suit, and the same size equivalent is rather skimpy in this model. It's not that it's tight--it's that there is sparse material under the arms/across the chest, as well as far too high on the leg (in a ""not-flattering"" way!). I don't know if going up a size would work on this suit, but if you're thinking of ordering it, definitely thinking about ordering a size larger. Also the rump was a bit too skimpy on the material."
2,Pretty good gameplay...only 10 hours of it,"Ok, well, I gave Tony Hawk's Underground only 2 Stars because of the length of the game. I beat this game in three days, and then tried to play more, but it was just boring after you finsihed the game.On the other hand, The gameplay is smooth, and its a fun game while it lasts. That part deserves about 4 stars.This is a fun game for a few hours, and definatley deserves a rent or two... but definately not a $50.00 purchase, you'll get bored in less than a week-Justin"
3,"Warning, This Game Is Not For Claustrophobic People!","Ok This is no skateboarding game, this is a fiesta of cardriving and stupid stunts, not a real skateboarding game. YOu dont have to be the best skateboarder to win, you just have to be the stupidist. Dont believe me? Then how come everything you do is a stunt, not involving skateboarding in anyway, and so dangerous that only an idiot would ever try it. DONT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU WANT TRUE SKATYEBOARDING FUN, instead buy THPS 1, 2, 3, or 4. BUY THIS GAME if you want a bunch of daredevil nonsense."
2,disapointed,I just bought the game. Nothing new. After 2 hours of play the game crashed on the menus ;(
1,totally dum,"how much bettr could th get? it sux, the first few were ok, watr they gonna add, po-lease, dont buy it, get sumthin like the gta pack, or halo, sumthin worht ur while, not the same old tony hawk"
4,Pretty good!,"This game is loaded with a ton of extra cool stuff, like racing cars, hopping off roofs to collect stuff, etc. But the skating part of the game seems like it's loosing it's edge. For instance, you can land a trick off a quarter pipe 20 ft'high on to flat ground perfectly?? And the skate board moves way tooo fast! You will eaily breeze by rails and ramps because it's going too fast! But still the game is good & the levels & missions are awesome even though the skating feels very un-realistic."
4,"Decent, but could have been better.....","As my title says.....Decent. However, it could have been better, a whole lot better in fact. The graphics are top-of-the-line as is the gameplay, and soundtrack. I love the Tony Hawk games, i really do...but to make a game this short, i can't get over it. It will take you a matter of a few hours to beat, even on hard mode. The whole idea of having a plot was well done, and the non-skating parts didn't bother me at all (although some people hate them), actually i think they give a refreshing non-linearity to the game. The driving is bad i will admit, you could beat the game in the time it takes you to master it.I gave this game 4 stars because, yes, i did like it. Had it been 5 or 6 hours longer i would have given it 5 stars. The multiplayer is fun as well, and customizing your own levels, goals, tricks, board, and skater is also cool. I would suggest a buy only if you are a serious fan of the previous games. Otherwise, rent or borrow it from a friend."
4,I love this show!,"This was the best season of QAF! However, I didn't really like how it ended, for some reason it felt like an anti-climax with the sudden change of character and change of mind between Brian and Justin (sorry if im giving away too much). But oh well, it was a great show which sadly had to come to an end. : ("
4,sorry,"sorry to see it go. i thought it ended well and logically enough. however, like any soap opera, no matter the imperfections, you hate to see your little coterie of friends depart. i hope something else like this comes along soon."
4,Queer as Folk Final Season,"I enjoyed the last season very much, as I've followed the series throughout. I was a little disappointed with how it ended, but that's real life, so it stuck in tune with the show. The characters were well thought out and fell into their typical ways and the ending though disappointing was a good ending to everyone's character."
2,Over-priced and Predictable,"The listing says 870 minutes, but 13 episodes at about 45 minutes a shot means that it's closer to 570 minutes - I'm not sure where the additional five hours comes in, unless of course they're including extras in that (something which other DVDs tend not to include in the headline figure).So, you get about nine or ten hours of actual show for your money. At around US$7 per hour, then, how does this series stack up?It's absolutely predictable: Every plot point, every storyline, every theme has been done (and done better) in previous series. And they're all massively signalled in advance, providing no real surprises at any point in this final season.If you're a fan of the show then it's watchable, if comfort-watching and mainly just to see how everything gets wrapped up at the end of the series run. But at the extortionate price of this box set, you'd be better off either watching it on TV or heading to eBay for a cheaper copy because this box set is hugely overpriced."
3,The Writers Darken the Plot,This excellent series gets a bit disappointing in the early episodes as the charcters get dark and bitchy.Fortunately the last few episodes get a bit more upbeat and save the satisfaction enough that onewishes the series hadn't ended.
2,Bad packaging!,I bought this and theres nothing to hold the discs firm in place! I read the reviews on here and nobody bothers to complain! I am waiting for my replacement since one of the discs dislodged during delivery. I'm downloading season 5 from online just incase it dislodges again. I think they should have put more thought into packaging this set!!
1,do not bother,they must have run out of ides because that is what it seemed like watching this season and brian still gets what he wants.
3,Not as good as the others,"This highly anticipiated record fails to impress. Jazzmatazz 2 the new reality was a masterpiece, but this record is far too commercial, and has too much weight on soul and not on jazz. There are though a couple of extremely good tracks like who's there, certified and plenty. It's worth buying if you like Guru, and his big ego."
2,Mirror was cracked,"The mirror was cracked and the company told me that they did not have a replacement, and they were not very helpful. The fountain was cute the crackedmirror was the only thing wrong with it."
3,Be informed when buying a HP !!!!,"Bought an HP Photosmart R717 in the summer of 2005 for $324.74. 4 months after the camera warranty was up and after minimal usage the camera was displaying: 0000000F-10FB-1BD-024 Error Message, on the display screen.When I called HP about getting my camera repaired I was told that it would be too expensive to repair. I was informed it would cost around $200.00 dollars to receive most likely a refurbished replacement camera, with only a 3-month warranty.After trying the replacement camera for 15 days I was then to send my old camera back as partial payment for the replacement camera.I told HP no thanks, because they had already gotten enough money from me."
1,Not that great,"I'm going to be completely honest with you. I hated the HP camera's because 1. does not take great pictures at night 2. digital zoom is not great either 3. blur's out if you do not stand still taking the picture. I've had an old HP camera and I have had this newer HP camera and they are all the same. It doesnt seem like it really matters what MP they are. Still bur's out and it is disappointing. I guess it really depends on the person about this camera but I'd rather have a Sony, Samsung, or some other company's item. =)"
2,"SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AN ""M"" SERIES","My daughter had a different ""M"" Series HP Digital Camera and DOCK. After the LCD display was broken, I ordered this ""value priced"" camera in its place. I felt sure that since it was an M425, it would work on her ""M Series"" DOCK. It DOES NOT. I need to purchase a DIFFERENT dock for this camera. This was a BIG disappointment. The camera is small and functional, and overall is a fairly good value for the money; but there are a few BASIC features that it is MISSING. Most noteably, this camera does NOT have a viewfinder. You must use the LCD display as the viewfinder. If the LCD would happen to break, the camera would be completely useless. If you are looking for an INEXPENSIVE camera, this one may be OK; but just REMEMBER that it is VERY, VERY BASIC. Spend a little more for better features."
3,"Ok, but could be a lot better.","We wanted a simple, easy to use digital camera and the guy at Circuit City recommended this one. We just took it on our trip and while it worked ok, I wish we would've shelled out a little more and gotten a better camera.My major complaint is that the shutter lag is awful. Scenic shots came out great, but almost anything with people came out fuzzy. Also, we had to replace the batteries twice in five days which was a hassle. I think we're going to return it and get something else."
4,I really liked this camera! Enough to buy it twice.,"I really liked this camera! Enough to buy it twice. I purchased this camera in March 2006 and it had an unfortunate collision with the concrete garage floor. The lens automatically comes out when the camera is on and it happened to fall right on the lens (My husband's fault). I had him go out the next day and buy another I was that impressed with the clear photos. This time (July 2006)it had another close encounter with a carpeted floor from a one foot distance, again the camera was on and the lens was out. It hit the floor with a satisfying thud. (My fault). SO EXCEPT FOR THE FRAGILE LENS, I would like to purchase this camera again because of it's ease of use and clarity of photos except WE'RE TOO CLUMSY!"
2,"Horrible Shutterlag, otherwise good.","I recieved this camera as a birthday present. Its great if you want a starter point and shoot, but folks should be aware of the following features. 1. you have almost no control over the image settings, the autofocus is pretty good, but you don't have many other options. 2. There is no manual view finder (i.e. no hole to look through). You have to use the digital display as viewfinder, which is a little frustrating when you are almost out of batteries. 3. The shutterlag is terrible. Unless you are very very steady, the pictures will be blurry. On the upside, its relatively cheap, it does take decent pictures, its VERY easy to use, and doesn't eat batteries. The shutterlag issue drove me bonkers, and I've switched to the sony cybershot."
1,Another BAD experience with an HP product,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! The camera worked fine for the first few months with the exception that it used batteries at a ridiculous rate. If I took approximately 30 pictures I would have to go thru 2 sets of batteries. If I took 5 pictures and put the camera away for a couple of weeks I would have to replace the batteries to take pictures. Then for no apparent reason it's functionality started to go awry. I try to take pictures of my kid's during special events and the flash would'nt go off and I'd get a VERY low light picture. I'd push the Flash Settings Button and it would start recording a video. I also bought a new computer that came with an HP printer that did'nt work properly straight out of the box. Every time I tried to print something it would pull the paper unevenly and result in a jammed up printer. NO MORE HP PRODUCTS FOR ME.
2,A little disappointed...,This camera seems to be very easy to use and has great graphic instructions on the camera but I had difficulty operating the camera at night and went on a trip to Lake Powell and the camera stopped working completely (perhaps the heat was an issue) but other people who were also on the trip had no problems with their camerasApparently I also need a memory card and not just batteries because the camera will only take 2 or 3 pics with two double AA batteries! Then it says it must shut down
3,Good for price,"Good camera for the price you pay, picture quality is very good. I gifted it to my dad and he is very happy about the neat quality of the pictures."
3,Point & Shoot Simplicity,"HP Photosmart M425 5MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoomis simplicity itself. All the basic functions are there in this lightweight, basic compact camera. The icons are easily understood and onboard graphic additions like frames can be fun. It doesn't seem to go through batteries as fast as other digital cameras I have. It's also super easy to transfer images and videos to my computer, with or without HP's Photosmart software (I actually prefer Google's freeware, PicasaII, to transfer and catalog images much more quickly).I keep it in my purse, and often pull it out to snap something or to show off my pictures, clearly visible in the 1.7"" digital screen, to friends and co-workers (hey, if I have to look at their kids and grandkids pics, then they have to ooooh and aaahhhh over my pretty pet portraits!).The only gripe I have is having to reset the date with battery changes (in the few instances I actually wanted a date-stamp on my photos)."
2,pansy,"This is the wussiest camera I have ever used. I bought the year long warranty, which I highly recommend as I ended up breaking 4 of these cameras over 2 years. The shutter lens gets stuck constantly. If it gets just a little rain on it, it gets frazzled or dies. If you drop it, even from 3 or so feet, it's dead. If you are the kind of person who puts your camera in it's case in between every shot, and are vigilant about it's safety, then it's not a bad camera. But if you are even a little outdoorsy, or clumsy, and esp. if you're both, look at the olympus stylus 770 sw, or just don't buy this camera."
2,HP does not stand behind this product,I bought this camera less than a year ago. I went to use it recently and it was locked up like it was docked. HP said it sounded like an internal hardware failure and my camera was out of warranty. All HP would do was sell me another camera for $100. I don't think this is good customer service.
1,Horrible quality,"I bought this camera 4 months ago. The on/off switch no longer works and the camera is a piece a trash now. I contacted HP support. Unfortunitely, it only came with 90-day warrenty. So I was offered to pay $115 to exchange for a used one, imagine that!. That ends my desire of buying any product from HP.So make sure purchase entended warrenty!!!"
2,OK But Not All I Thought It Would Be,Don't buy this book for the recipes. It is no so bad about telling you about the different types of honey but I wanted more facts and more recipes...maybe something exotic. I didn't feel it lived up to the title.
4,From a limited perspective.,"Having only read the story by Eliza Chan (""The Blood of the Blade"") I'm not in a position to offer an overall rating for the book. That said, I think the volume is worth checking out for this story alone. Strong narrative thread, clever structure and strong characters all contribute to a very satisfying read. Not entirely sure about the use of sunglasses in fantasy, but that's my own pecadillo. Click ""Buy now"" and forget about the credit card bills. Go on."
3,Dream stories.,"This series of short stories is a total departure from the norm of realistic writing by Chinese authors. The entire set of stories can be viewed as dreams, many of which have elements from prior stories.She seems fascinated by birds and insects, as they are common elements. Though 'dark' in nature, the dreams are more surreal than nightmare. Each has that disconnect from the rational that is common to those stories we tell ourselves while we sleep.Not as enjoyable as her ""Five Spice Street""; this will appeal to those wanting to read her earlier writing or those looking for work from China that doesn't fit the mold."
2,change in fragance,"Recently Little Tree changed the fragance of the ""spice"" tree. The new scent ressembles cinnamon which although a ""spice"" is not as appealing as the original. Through discussions with Little Tree, they conducted some type of research which indicated that more people attributed the new scent to spice verses the old. If you like the original scent I recommend you contact little tree and tell them."
3,Absolutely smells NOTHING like the old Spice,"I bought these for my husband and was so disappointed when he confirmed what the other reviewers have said: the manufacturer has changed the scent and it's more ""cinnamon"" than spice of the old days. I know it's not this company's fault which is why we didn't ask for a refund but we will be selling/giving away the trees to friends and family."
4,Great reference book,"A pretty good reference book on UDT/SEAL equipment. Wish it would have had more pictures, as someof the photos were taken at an angle. But wel worth the price"
2,Good concepts but sloppy execution.,"The concepts in this book are very useful but the book itself is full of flaws. In chapter 3 a number of equations didn't print correctly. Examples (e.g. Table 7.2, Figure 7.2) are not calculated correctly. References such as Smith 1992 either are not listed in the reference list (no Smith, Smith but no 1992 publications) or lead to several alternatives (1992a, 1992b, 1992c) and you can't tell which one is being referenced at the point you're interested in. The content is hard enough to understand without the careless editing. For me it was still worth getting, but I would've loved to have an accurate version of this book."
5,Great knitting needles!,"I bought these bamboo knitting needles for my mom as it was her first time knitting, and she loves them! I think they must be easier to use than the metal ones because they're not quite as slippery."
3,kniiting needles,This are fine for the price smooth and lightweight. I prefer rosewood. I love the short length and a size 9 seems to be diffcult to find
2,review,"it is a flat pickup ring, I thought that it was made specially for les paul but it bends a little... it does work but if you can find the one specially made for les paul it could be better 4 u..."
3,Not what I expected,"I can't remember how I got this book in the first place. Possibly as a gift or during one of my thrift store shopping sprees but ""Fever"" was sitting with my many other unread books so I gave it a try. As an author, I believe you have to catch the reader's attention on the first PAGE! ""Fever"" was painful at points as I got bored with the storyline but I continued reading in the hopes that it would get better. Carla got on my nerves when all she had to do was talk to her husband about what she went through. I guess the best ""twist"" was Troi lusting after her brother-in-law Sam. What happens to the characters by the end of the book is so open ended that I assumed that there would be a follow up but I have yet to bother to find out. Just to be fair, I probably should re-read ""Fever"" but after I read it the first time, I donated it to charity. Maybe someone else will like it."
4,muy bueno,es la seleccion ideal para conocerla. generalmente las antologias no son buenos pero esta si lo es
1,Not as described,"This item was described as a Philips branded rt angle F adapter. What I received was a RCA packaged adapter, with no markings on the actual adapter. It appears that these adapters are made in China, likely most, if not all of the different brands are made in the same factory. Some are sold at a premium price depending on the brand. Bought this because I thought it would be a better quality than what was available locally. Not so! Save your money, just buy it at your local electronics dealer, probably cheaper in the long run."
3,An interesting view from a major French mountaineer,"This is really an autobiography of Terray. It's strengths are in its extensive description of French mountaineering in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s. Terray has been part of some of the major climbing endeavors in the Alps (the Walker spur on the Grand Jorasses or the north face of Eiger) as well as the first climb an 8,000 meter peak -- Anapurna. He also presents honest and direct portraits of some of his climbing partners, such as Rebuffat or Lachenal.While the book has no particular weakness, in my view it falls far short of the inspired writings of some of his Frech contemporaries -- Gaston Rebuffat (""Starlight and Storm"" -- highly recommended) or Maurice Herzog (""Anapurna"" -- a riveting account of the expedition)."
1,Gray Hair To Orange In A Single Application!,"I've now tried several Just For Men colors. They are all good for a few days, but within a week or two the results are always the same. Copper!It'd be fine if the dyed hair simply went gradually back to gray, but no such luck. As the color fades, orange is left in its place. It doesn't matter if I use medium brown, dark brown, darkest brown, ash brown... Orange, orange, orange are the results. And each time in between i waited several weeks to grow out the previous copper before i planted a new Just For Men in order to grow a fresh crop of orange.Haven't you seen men with copper hair color and wonder why they would dye their hair that color! It's not them, it's the product!This review is for all the men who slink away thinking it must be something wrong with them or how they applied the product. No, no, and no. Should be our response. This product is not the answer for us."
5,Best A Capella jazz chorus ever,"A historic recording, this synergy between a German A Capella choir and one of the most prominent jazz pianist of the XXth Century. This record has a flair of happiness that you will never find annywhere else, plus a romantic touch that only lovers can understant. Just great. I am listening to this record for 30 years and just cannot stop listening to it. Excellent in dire times: gives you back a happy and relaxed mood ... just great ... probably the best record ever done in that style of a mixture of voice choirs and piano jazz."
3,so-so,"This is a weak album. With any other pianist, this wouldn't have worked. Not the best Oscar Peterson. Try ""Canadiana Suite"" if you can find it."
3,Peterson Limited,"This combination neither swings nor makes for very romantic and moody music, if you look at it from the jazz point of view.It's just a fine cocktail music, background music; middle-of-the-road pop showing some jazz influence..."
5,"A solid, compact LCD TV ...","Super quality picture, easy to set up, and even comes with a convenient swivel base). Picture has three picture modes -- Vivid, Standard, and Pro that provides different levels of default contrast and crispness in the picture. A bit pricier than comparable sets, but well worth it."
4,"A great game, but not what i expected...","It's a great game but it's not what I thought it would be. It's very short, namco could of least made more then 4 levels and they could have made it a little harder because I beat the game the first day I got it(no joke!). However it's a very action packed game and the sound and music is very realistic but when the charactors talk it looks like a Japanese godzilla movie.The graphics are better then the first one though. It's a pretty clean game to, there's no blood or gore.It's better then the first Time Crisis but I suggest that you rent it or borrow it before you buy it."
2,Time Crisis: Project Titan,"This is a shooter game, where you go through the levels, and do nothing but shoot. This can become boring after a while. I wouldn't recommend this game for people who get bored easily. This game can also be frustrating, because if you have a GUNCON like me, you have to stop the game and realign the sight every 15 seconds. Graphics could be better...but, we are talking Playstation. Overall, the perfect game for a rainy day.If you buy this game, I would recommend a GUNCON.(The ""gun"" thing you can find in arcades.) For me, this makes the game more interesting, but, suit yourself."
2,The first one was better.......,"I couldn't wait for this one to be released.....I was upset every time it was postponed, and when I finally got it yesterday for my birthday, I rushed home to play it. Well, it's not quite what I expected. The story line isn't nearly as good as the first one. It doesn't have an arcade mode and it should have included a 2 player option.....it would have made it a little better. The gameplay is incredibly slow (the bad guys all but beg you to shoot them) and it's so easy a blind person could finish it without a problem, you can fly through all the levels. It would seem that since it was postponed a few times they could have put a little more thought and creativity into it. It is a real disappointment. Take this advice...rent or borrow it before buying."
3,An engaging but abrupt slice of Americana,"Comparisons to ""Huckleberry Finn"" or ""Cold Sassy Tree"" are apt. Like these other novels, ""The Way to Bright Star"" is an adolescent's journey through an America at war. The people met along the way are the book's greatest strength: soldiers, everyday farmers, a girl in disguise. The dialogue is great, and the settings evoke a time when our county was truly the new frontier.But the jumps from the Civil War era to the early 19th century can be abrupt, and leave you with a sense of an unfulfillment. The ending in particular was very disappointing, both as flashback and in the narration. Is Mr. Brown planning to make this book a series? If so, the ending will leave you hungry for more. But if this is all there is, you're in a for a disappointing letdown."
3,Lots of loose ends,"While the characters are memorable and the story has plenty of dramatic and humorous moments, this was ultimately an unsatisfying book. After setting up numerous scenarios that beg for elaboaration, the author seems to lose interest and flatly conclude the situation.The fate of a main character and long lost love is summed up in one short statement. Several interesting affairs of the heart get started and are never resolved.A supposed orphan discovers a family member and no more is mentioned about the encounter. Even the main point of the titular journey, delivering the camels to Bright Star, abruptly ends with no resolution of their fate. In a way, the book does read like an older person's rememberances. it rambles, touches on points and finally, instead of coming to a conclusion, the author just stops talking. The book has its moments, but be prepared for some frustration."
1,buyer beware,"Ever heard the old saying don't judge a book by its cover? Well, for this title, it's don't judge this DVD by its cover. The cover photo is not from this movie, but is a publicity still from the film Malizia. I bought this DVD because I'm a fan of Laura Antonelli, and there are so few DVDs out there with her in it. However, you'd have to be a Antonelli fanatic to watch, let alone buy, this bizarre film, whose plot I won't describe because, quite frankly, I didn't quite figure out what it was. Antonelli also kept her clothes on the entire movie, so be forewarned if you were thinking the movie had at least puerile interest."
3,Not as advertised,"I received the pens in good condition, and I am very pleased with the appearance. However, the description states that the pens write with blue ink, but the ink is actually black."
5,Awesomeness!,"When i bought these pens, I had expected for the worse from what people said. I Just got them yesterday, and they are amazing! only one was broken and i can suck that up! That means i still have 59 more! Whoever ordered this and is trying to say this is a waste of your money, well its not! I was very ahppy when i got it! The things that the pen came with isnt a case but who cares! I think that if you are woanting to get it, then you cshould buy it!"
3,syringe pens7,The pens work well but they like to break which leaks out the colored liquid. Also they crack easily and the case it comes in isn't very sturdy. Other than that people really love them and are fun.
3,Question,Do you sell this same lot of items with pens that write in black instead of black? Some official documents can only be written in black ink.
2,Disapointed,"I'm a nurse and I got these for my coworkers for Christmas. They were cool and a hit with everyone, but they were so poorly packaged that 29 out of 60 were in smithereens when they arrived. I was disappointed that I was only able to use half of what I paid for."
4,fun novelty pens,"i bought these as a promo for flu shots and people love them. many people ask where they can get them because they know someone in the medical profession and want to give them as a gift. the only downside is they are not very good writing tools, but they look cool so who cares"
4,Not actually needles.,"Very cute and were a huge hit with my nursing friends. I get a lot of comments on how cool they are. Black ink is perfect for charting and it is pretty obvious who has ""borrowed"" my pen. Would recommend. It is much more cost effective to buy in the big package. Only one of the pens was broken upon arrival, but I was able to fix it with a dab of glue and it is good as new. Great product."
2,Good perfomer but poor quality construction,"Having owned many shortwave radios, both portable and table-top, I never really liked this one.Yes, it does perform well, sounds good for a mid-size portable and is relatively inexpensive, but the switches just feel really cheap and loose. I don't like the quirky ergonomics either and to top it all, after a year or two with only very occasional use, the encoder (tuning knob) started playing-up. Now when you try to tune it, it either doesn't change the frequency or randomly jumps backwards in frequency when you're trying to tune forwards. From what I've read elsewhere, I'm not alone in having this problem with this radio. Think of this as a disposable radio and you won't be disappointed."
3,"Good for FM, So-So for the Rest","I bought this radio for the exceptional FM performance, and it's lived up to its reputation. Very sensitive, very selective, all around good performance on FM. For AM and shortwave, it's only so-so. AM and SW selectivity is very good, splatter is at a minimum, but sensitivity is less than ideal.Ergonomically, this radio is an acquired taste. The same knob controls the volume and tuning, depending on which of two other buttons are pressed first. The positioning of the on-off button in the center, at the bottom of the faceplate, is about as far out of thumb reach as it can be. These are just two of numerous ergo irks. While these may be overlooked by those seeking an excellent FM radio at a good price, for other users these design quirks may be too much bother to master.All in all, if it's excellent FM performance in a portable that's sought, this may be the best there is for the price. But don't expect that quality of reception on all bands. Three star."
4,Very Good Value World Band Radio,"Pros: Well made, excellent sound, a lot of features for the priceCons: Adjusting volume, using the built-in charger and storing and retrieving frequency settings could be easier to do.The less expensive KA1107 looks to have less features but easier to use."
2,THe rechargable batts came dead,"The Ni-MH batts don't hold a charge over one minute, even after attempting to charge them for a week, removing about ten dollars retail value from my purchase. Tried to return just the batts, not allowed. Now using AA batts that will fail at inopportune times, not the point of a handheld radio."
2,Very disappointing!,"I purchased this radio with high expectations. The reviews indicated this radio was excellent in the AM bands, mine isn't/wasn't. FM reception is very good when using the included external antenna. The problem is with every other band especially AM. I live about 65 miles from Houston, TX and cannot pick up a decent AM radio signal. Every AM station I receive, and the number is very small, is full of static to the point it is useless. I can pick up a few stations on the other bands, but nothing even close to what I was expecting and again there is lots of static. Perhaps someone experienced in worldband radios could find ways to make this work, but it's not for me."
2,"Worked for a while, then gave up","It worked for about a week, and the FM band gave up. I called the company and they sent me a new one. Then after a couple of months, the AM band went out. I gave up, it's a piece of junk. It would be somewhat normal for a single item to go bad, but two in a row. That's too much of a coincidence to be a fluke. Poor quality control for sure."
3,Small buttons and hard learning curve,"Hi,I bought this radio as a gift for a relative in India.Mind you there is a learning curve on how to operate the device and also the buttons on it are smaller than the traditional radio. This was a hurdle for me as i am not into radios and going through limited 'getting started' documentation was a pain. The sound quality was okay compared to cheaper traditional models."
2,poor quality,i decided to spend a bit more for quality reception. What a disappointment. The sound was not clear and it is so complicated to use. Bad choiceKaito KA1103 - Portable radio
1,Typical Chinese Product,"First of all, I loved this radio more than any other radio that I have owned. To avoid redundancy, read the five star reviews.Now the bad news. I lost all AM and Shortwave reception after 7 months. The reset button reset the clock and the default volume but did nothing to restore reception (so it's not an antenna overload problem). So end the end, I got ripped off by the Chinese once again while my 30 year old GE radio (which was made in America back then) keeps on playing like it was brand new.It would be interesting to see a survey of all these people who gave great reviews shortly after getting their Kaito and ask them if their radio is still working after one year. Given China's history of lack of quality, I suspect that you would see a lot more 1 star reviews.If you want to gamble, go ahead but I've got better things to do than spend $90 every 7 months on a Chinese piece of trash."
1,Disappointed,"I own the KA 1102 and am very happy with it. However, I also purchased the KA 1103 which does not work at all. I cmmunicated with the manufacturers who gave me some advice as to what could be causing the problem. However, nothing they said helped to cure the problem. I requested that I return the radio for repairs but they required that I use a return number. However, they refused to give me that number. So I am unable to return the radio to them for repair.While some Chinese products are really fine, I guess they are only interested in profit making from the USA. They actually do not back-up their products."
5,Kaito KA1103 A great experience,"Dear friends, let me share with you my great experienceswith the fabulous Radio Kaito KA-1103 which I bought on Amazon a fewmonths ago, I am delighted with the contac I've made in SSB. I amamateur and I can get to my colleagues around the world only with thisfabulous Radio. I created a blog to tell my experiences with it. I sendthe same to see it and give me your opinion:[...]"
3,Are these dolls appropriate??,"Most of the my scene dolls are quite lovely. I would, however, discourage people from buying the Bling Bling dolls for the recommended ages (6-12 yrs), which, quite frankly, look like prostitutes and table dancers. Do parents out there really want their little girls to go out dressed like hookers?"
1,......,"If i could rate my scene dolls i would give them -1 (no offence.) I think bratz dolls are great but argue to me about my opinions. Bratz dolls have great clothes and i love playing and collecting them. They show girls that you could be anything you want to be. A fashion designer, rockstar, and a lot more. Plus u can have fun doing what you do. BRATZ ARE HOT!!!!!!!! KEEP IT REAL."

1,They probably don't even have a Courtney,Do not order this. They sent me a Day to Nite Barbie instead of a Courtney.
1,"Okay, I'll beat that","Your just jealous that the Bratz dolls get to do all the fun stuff and all the My Scene do is crap. And yes, it is possible for real girls to have things like that happen. Bratz do things girls in real life would do. My Scene dolls are ugly peices of junk. And like it or not, the Bratz go to paris and tokyo and stuff. and they get to become Rock Starz. Like it or not. the Bratz are rock starz so deal with it."
5,romantic suspense,"Another great SVU book,in which Jessica is carrying on a secret affair ---no,affair isnt quite the word--with her profeesor. And lurks in the shadows is a jealous ex who is as mad as a cut snake and just as dangerous."
3,Its a great book...but is kinda boring,I like the book. And the series...don't ge tme worng. Its jsut this one didn't live up to the reputation.
2,un buen intento por resucitar,"Me parece que es el penúltimo trabajo de la banda.Precedido por ""Hope you like it"", ""Don't be fooled by the Name"" y ""Save the world"", esta propuesta deja mucho que desear.Composiciones débiles, complacientes que no aportan nada nuevo a su sonido, al sonido que habían forjado anteriormente y que comienza a decaer con ""Save the World"".Música repetitiva sin mucho sentido, letras sin idea ni profundidad.Después vendrá un último intento (que yo conosca): No Sweat, que pasa sin pena ni gloria, al iugal que esta obra.En este momento ya no está el vocalista original, que al parecer era el espíritu de la banda, aunque interpereta un par de canciones. Por algo AC/DC lo recluta para suplir a su vocalista trás su muerte.Creo que al grupo se le secó la creatividad y de la potente propuesta inicial, no quedó más que el nombre y tres de sus integrantes."
1,Baby Age mixed up products.,"Same thing happened to me as the person from the previous review. They sent a pink pillow instead of the crib set, and will not honor the same price for the bedding set. I have to send it back and they will give a refund. What a hassle!"
1,Really bad!,"Baby Age sent me a funny pink feeding pillow with the same value of the crib set, refusing changing it to the crib set. I have to return it by Amazon A-Z Guarantee,wasting a lot of time."
5,Nothing short or superb,"I purchased this VHS version for one reason.The DVD version of this concert did NOT include two of Mark Knopfler's most famous songs from this concert, ""Money for Nothing"" and ""Sultans of Swing"" Both of which should have been included on the DVD."
5,Awesome Musician,"Mark Knopfler is our favorite musician, bar none! This is a wonderful concert, but with an exception. For some reason the DVD (unlike the video)does not include Sultans of Swing which is one of the best of all. Otherwise it is a fantastic must-see! He just gets better and better!"
3,Why in earth the DVD is incomplete???????????????????,"This is one of Mark Knopfler's best performance ever, however, the DVD does not come with his performance of Sultans of Swing and Money for Nothing, whereas these songs are included in the VHS version. I am a big Dire Straits fan and there are several of there songs that I prefer to Sultans of Swing, however, Mark Knopfler's performance of the sited song is just amazing. I haven't seen anything like it. So the big question is, why didn't they include Sultans of Swing and Money for Nothing in the DVD? The DVD as a whole would get my 5 stars, I have taken 2 away for the frustration of knowing that one of the best guitar performance ever was not included!With that being said, I still think it is worth buying."
2,Disappointed...,"I purchased this DVD assuming the content would include the same set list as the earlier release on VHS tape. Disappointed to learn that the great version of ""Sultans of Swing"" was omitted. Rest of the DVD was enjoyable, but can't help but feel cheated by the trimming of maybe the best part of the performance."
4,Missing the best track,"After having my VCR destroy my well played and much loved VHS copy of this title, I quickly ordered the DVD version.Unfortunately, I did not look at anything other than the title (such as reviewers comments) and ordered it. This foolishly thinking that the VHS and DVD versions would be the same.Upon receipt I noticed that my favorite performance from the VHS edition ""Sultans of Swing"" had been deleted from the DVD version. This is a song that is timeless and the performance is phenomenal! So, why in a format that allows for even more content (DVD) would they choose to omit songs? Poor decision in my opinion.For editing reasons I give this DVD 4 stars. Musically it is 5+ stars.Just be forewarned, not all original content is there."
3,"Great content, technically disappointing","While the performance is wonderful and oozes with mood that few live shows do, anyone buying this should know that the audio and video are subpar at best.The audio, which I believe for concerts is the critical piece, is compressed and almost lifeless, even compared to most other shows coming from VHS. 5.1 might help but, it would be masking a mediocre recording that is presented, not in Stereo PCM but, in lossy DD 2.0. There is little low end and an apparent bump in the mid bass which makes it sound quite muddy much of the time.The video is 1.33 and very soft. Only close-ups even seem to be in focus. I am sure that a 92"" 16x9 screen does not help so YMMV.The concert is great and worth owning. I did not send mine back because of these technical issues. I am just disappointed by themIf this show is ever re-mastered for blu-ray with PCM or HD audio, I will buy it again in a second."
4,"Smooth, Soft, and HUGE","When I ordered this mouse pad, I had no idea how big it would be. This mouse pad is HUGE. It is so big that i don't even use half of it...i usually have 3/4 of it hanging down off the side of my desk. I refuse to cut it..I payed for it i wont destroy it :)Pros:-Very slick surface-Very smooth and soft, comfortable for your wrist/arm-Its size, if you need a large mouse pad this is the one for you, and if you need a smaller mouse pad you can cut it down to size or have it hang off your desk.-Looks nice-Comes in a nice box (I know this doesn't mean much, but its a nice touch)Cons:- Could be to big for some peopleThats about it, there really are no cons to this mouse pad except for the size, which is also a pro. You can't go wrong with this one, if you need a gaming mouse pad this is the one to buy."
5,"Fricken Huge, but fricken good","Overall it's a great cloth mouse pad. It works great with my Evoluent Vertical Mouse2 and I'm sure any other optical mouse. I've tried 2 and they both work fine.FYI it's 16 x 17 inches. You'll need a lot of desk space to use this pad. Unless, of course, you use a mouse that's the size of a softball. I guess you could cut it in half or down to the size you want, but I'm going to keep mine huge."
4,Donald O'Connor is more than wunderbar,"This video is great for a beginner, and very amusing for a Donald O'Connor fan. Especially amusing bit with Debbie Reynolds when they allude to their interactions with Gene Kelly during Singin' in the Rain. Debbie Reynolds also does some very funny impressions (but not of Gene Kelly- haha). Mr. Donald shows off occasionally, but lets his lady co-host do most of the teaching. Still lots of fun."
3,Not the kind of furniture I had in mind.,"If you want to build the furniture they show, all is well. I just didn't happen to care for what they had."
2,Inferior to OEM,I had been using the original manufacturer's filters that came with my Kenmore humidifier. I ordered these as a replacement when the originals ran out and I have to say that these just feel a lot cheaper and less effective (less dense) than the originals.
1,useless,"weave is way looser than oem filter. It doesn't absorb or wick any moisture, just sits it the water. Do not buy"
3,"It's the Skating, Stupid","What a disappointment this game is. I loved the entire Pro Skater series for one simple reason: the skating. It was a blast to fly all over the place on your board. This game is still strong when you are allowed to skate, but the story mode forces you to achieve pointless tasks running, walking and driving vehicles. When you are on your board, THUG is as fun as any of the Pro Skater series; when you aren't, which is far too often, it's boring and frustrating."
2,Disappointing game from Activison,"It is too bad that Activision has strayed so far from the quality of this game in previous versions. The game has a lot less to do with skateboarding and seems to unnecessarily pander to 13-17 year old males. The people who were waiting for this game to come out would have bought it without all the controversial themes - strip joint and pole dancers, disrespect to police etcs. Those things didn't help them sell the game and certainly will keep some people from buying it - especially mothers buying it for their sons."
3,This game is not good for chidren under 12 or 11,This is a good game playing 2 player but the missions are not good for 11 year olds and under because in the mission are bad in one way: there is kids that are drugged up and they are in the game alot.(In the first place) The good thing is thst they don't show them. Overall the game is good except with that part.
4,WOW.....GET IT,wow.....tony hawk underground is an awesome game for the ps2 for skateboarding fans..its alot better than the first 4 and now you have the element to get off your board unlike the rest of the 4....you go from a nobody to a somebody...this actually has a story line to it..it even has a create-a-trick mode...i would definetly reccomend T.H.U.G.(Tony Hawk Underground) to any who wants some good skateboarding video game time....
4,Very good game,"I own Tony Hawk 1,3,4,and now THUG. When I heard that in this game you could not play story mode with any of the pro skaters, I was a bit disappointed. But once I played the game I realized that it is fun creating yourself in the game and playing as yourself. The game is very good. The music is nice and offers some new and different groups. The levels are nicely created with more spots to grind and do more moves on. They are also bigger than the other levels in the previous games. I was dissapointed however, with the graphics. They have not improved since the last game, and can be very choppy at times. They need to improve as the series continues. But in all this game is a must have."
4,Excellent Game! Excellent Gameplay! Excellent Graphics!,"Tony Hawk's Underground (THUG) is the first game of the Tony Hawk series where you do not play as an international superstar. Actvision takes you into the realistic alternative where you start out as a beginner, or ""punk"", and work your way up to success. The game has been talked about for months mainly because of its superb story mode. With about the same graphics as THPS 4, Underground takes skateboarding to a new level with the ability to walk, climb, and even drive. Some would deem this super, but I DO NOT! IF IT IS A SKATEBOARDING GAME, THEN WHY THE HELL DO YOU NEED TO WALK AND DRIVE! ALL I'M REALLY SAYING IS, THIS STORY MODE HAS BEEN TURNED INTO AN ADVENTURE GAME, NOT A SKATEBOARDING GAME! IF WE WANTED AN ADVENTURE GAME, WE WOULD'VE GOTTEN JAK II BUT WE WANTED A SKATEBOARDING GAME SO WE GOT UNDERGROUND, AND I SAY I WAS NOT THE ONLY ONE DISSAPOINTED. Excellent game on the other hand. 4 Thumbs up, I mean stars."
4,SWEEEEEET!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This game is almost too good to be true! I bought it and once I started playing I couldn't stop. You create your player, then go skate. You can download your face into your player. You can get off your board for huge combos, you can only get off your board for a limeted time to stay in a combo. You can create a trick. You can create a park and put goals in it. Beware some goals are a magnet to frustration. But another cool thing is, you can decide how hard the game is. You can choose: Too Easy. For people that are playing for the first time and have no idea what they're doing. Beginner: For people who have played a couple times and at least know what they're doing. Normal: A fun time for avrage Tony Hawk players. And last, Sick: Really hard goals for really good players. Great game! I suggest you buy it! If you like THPS4, you'll love this game."
2,Too glitchy,This game sucks!! Too many glitches in moon gravity and the game is too easy even in Sick mode!! And since when does Bam Margera have his hat on forever!!And how can Eric trick all those people that he did the McTwist when your skater can be a female?!!Overall not a bad game but needs improvement.
4,Pretty Cool Game,"In my opinion, THUG is on pretty good game. Here are some pros and cons to help you decide whether to get it. (I have this game for PS2, so some things might differ with other consoles.)Pros:- Create you own skater feature is better than ever.- Levels are bigger- Can get off you board and walk around.- Four different skill levels- Realistic blood (only a pro for some people)- Cool music- Create-a-deck feature is coolCons:- Too short (9 levels, only 8 with objectives)- Not good enough graphics (although they are better than some other games)- Controls are kind of complicatedWell, I guess the pros outweigh the cons. That's why I think this game deserves 4 out of 5 stars."
4,awesome,"This game is awsome. I loved it when I played It at my friend Hayes's house. I kept on wanting to play it. It is pretty hard but sooner or later you'll get the hang of it.You can also create your own tricks, players,parks . another cool thing is that you can make your player with du rags,caps,skull instead of head eyes floating in tha air instead of head and skull shrts no shirt,arms skeleton arms an baggy pants too. The only bad thing is that your best friend,eric turns into your enemy, but other than that I really recommend this game"
4,Deserves the Tony Hawks Name,"Okay this doesnt follow the normal Tony Hawk game because it has a story mode added in. But dont let that throw you. The gameplay is pretty much the same as in the previous games. You go around, completing goals to progress in the game. The only diffrence is that now you dont skate as a pro skater, but as you. One thing that put i didnt like about this installment in the Tony Hawk series is that the goals were simply too easy, I beat this game in about 4 days when it normally takes me months to finish one of these games. but that doesnt mean you shouldnt buy it. Even though ive had it for more than a month im still playing it on a daily basis, So if you enjoyed the previous game this ones for you."
5,"T,H,U,G,","this is a graet game,on creat a park you can do anything. you can have bildings,tanks,lava and tunnles(wich you can do a loop the loop in.) story mode is good to. it is true that erek becomes your enamey,like in tampa he forgets to sign you in for a skating competition when you went all the way from new jersy to get there this is a brilliant game and belleve me,it is GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,this game is a 3.5 Fair game,"i know everyone's first thought about this game:anotherrr tony hawkk game. IT is. But this 1 is better than th4. ThUg is one of those games you can't put down at first, but you may only play it 1 or 2 more times after you beat it.Descripition:You make a customized character[a punk] from the streets of NJ. You start off by doing small tasks like walking the dog to collecting garbage. But as the game progresses you could find your self doin mactwists off buildings. Where you end up is your decisonthis game also adds a multiplayer mode: fire in this mode you fire fireballs at your opponent[vis-versa] until one of you dies1-5 scale 5 being best-1 being worstGraphics:4Sound:3Replay value:2Gameplay:4Multiplayer:3Overall:3.5"
4,The best tony hawk's game ever!,"This game is the best tony hawk's game I've ever played the features are totally awesome and the idea of being able to do missions in cars is totally rad! The only flaw that kept it from getting 5 stars is the missions on it, they were fairly simple and thats only because i put the difficulty ""normal"" imagine if it were easier than that. But overall this game was bada$$ the graphics in this game are awesome. so dont wait,stop playing games like true crime and get your a$$ up and buy it. oh! on one more thing. being able to get off your skateboard and walk around is amazing"
5,Best Hawk Game Ever,"This game is sweet. The gameplay is awesome and the missions are fun, there a lot better then the other hawk games. Also the storyline is great and the side things, like drivng cars and running around, are awesome. This game is fing awesome and if you like skateboarding and/or the hawk games you should get it."
4,Greatest Tony Hawk Game Yet,"In this new tony hawk game you start out as a regular horrible skayer with one friend, but as you go throughout the game he turns out to by one of your worst enemys.By stealing some of your greatest moves, and taking your first chance to become pro. There are some pretty awesome tricks that you can do such as a McTwist right over a police helicopter. Most of the time there is a car sitting somewhere that you can jump into if you need to get to a place quick. One of the best parts in this game though I believe is the create-a-trick/create a course.Like most of the tony hawk games it doesn't have the greatest grafics, but it was good enough for me. This game is way funner than all the Tony Hawk games before it. My advice to anyone wanting a great skateboarding game is to get this one. Best I've ever seen.A+++++++"
4,This game was one of the best games I have ever played,"In Tony Hawk Underground(which I will be calling thug) is a really cool game. I got the game the first day it came out and I loved the new feature where you could get off of your board and run around where ever you want to go. I also loved the storyline in other Tony Hawk versions you would just go into levels having fun, but having no meaning to what you are doing. In thug you can also drive cars. This feature is really cool. At the last level you can drive a little dirt go kart over amazingly high jumps. The only bad thing about this game is that when you get out of the car you get out where the car originally was. I thought had they not done that it would of had more of the GTA feature to it. It's really cool to create your own character and having him start in an old run-down New Jersey neighboorhood and then going to competitins with Tony Hawk and other hit skaters. Overall, this game was the best and I think you should get it."
5,!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,OMG!!!! Im in LOVE with this game!!!!! its sooooo much fun!!! The graphics could be better......its still sooooooo much fun!!! BUY IT!! ASAP1!!! (((coming from a 14 yr old))
4,Game Of The Year!,"Please. Don't make the mistake of not getting this game because you think it's the same thing as THPS4. It's not! Here are some of the biggest differences:There is a new 100% addictive mini-game, firefight, if I'm not mistaken...The boards are totally different, as well as the tasks you have to do...The graphics are the best I've seen yet from any video game...and you can get on and off your board as you wish.There are probably more, but I'm not sure, because ever since I got Tony Hawk Underground, I haven't played THPS4.Sometimes with a game like this, I'd recommend you play it first somewhere, rather than buy it first, but in this case, I find it more appropriate to say go ahead and buy it already! Any skater, or fan will thoroughly enjoy this game."
4,Tony Hawk's Underground,My son enjoys playing this game everyday. It is nice to know when his breaks I can contact someone about getting a new one.
1,WOW,"Ok so i get this game for my girlfriend and it says very good condit. and when i look at it its pretty scratched up, but i think, ""hey the guy had good reviews"", nope, when she finally gets it, shes all excited, we put it in to her ps2 (I dont own a ps2 so i couldnt test it myself) and it starts then she selects *new game* and it freezes.. and this is the on the last day when i can return it.. thanks for false condition discription, shoulda been bad condition or broken, the dam case wasnt even in good condition.. total rip off, thanks."
4,good overall game.,"Tony hawk underground is a pretty fun game. It is actually pretty easy to get good at, and the story is probably best in the series. Even though it has kinda unrealistic gameplay, thats what i wanted from this game so i'm not complaining. now for the cons. In the story, some goals had to do with dumb things like driving cars or climbing building. personally, i bought this game to skateboard, not drive around. also, you have to spend ALOT of time trying to find lines, and get good. i feel so bad when i go online after getting beat by 1 million points. anyways, pretty good game, and kinda addictive."
3,THUG,I think the game is fun.It's a little different from past Tony Hawk titles.Unique challenges.For the skateboard purist.
3,This is good,"I'm a long-time fan of Civ, including Civ III, and I'm in the beta test program for this expansion pack. While I'm not allowed to say anything specific about the game, I think it's safe for me to say that I can't wait to have a copy of the final version. Civ Conquests does everything right to make some bite-sized chunks of Civ -- now I find myself playing the scenarios all the time instead of the main game, just because I can finish them faster. If you've ever played and liked Civ III, there's absolutely no reason not to pick this up."
4,THIS GAME ROCKS DUDES! I,"Why won't the real Tony Hawk please stand, please stand up.Cause this game rocks. This game rocks cause you can drive, walk, skate, and more.Land a bahhama air and a kickflip. This game Is so cool.Why won't the real Tony Hawk please stand, please stand up.BUY THIS GAME!"
4,T.H.U.G.,Does anyone know the name of the song in the commercial for this game?!?!? Awesome game!! one of my favorites and the songs in it are awesome....
1,What every parent should know,"I know that this game is rated 'T', but I was still surprised to see all the half-naked, gyrating girls throughout the game. I know that is attractive to many people, but as a mom whose son had played the previous Tony Hawk games, it wasn't what I expected, nor is it necessary for the game. It won't be back at our house."
1,stupid,It stinks on ice. I boght it for my son and I wasted my money. It is to violent. My son went mad and turened in to a indian and ate and broke the game.
1,"No good, boring","Boring GameAwful, a disgrace to the Playstation 2 consoleDo not buyworst game everterribleto easy for serious gamersrepeat do not buy"
5,Amazing,"THUG is simply the best sports game ever. Yes, better than any other sports game, including Madden."
4,I have actually PLAYED the game...imagine that,"First of all I love all these reviews that I have been on this site for weeks--even though the game just became available on the 28th of October, 2003. How can you review a game that you have never played?I guess Activision knew that the Hawk series was running its course, and decided to come up with a ""storyline"" to more involve the player in the various stages of the game. The only way to open up new levels (aside from the cheat codes) is to play through the ""story"" mode. When you take a step back, this new Hawk title is still about missions, some of which have nothing to do with performing tricks on your skateboard. On one mission I had to chase down this SUV full of gangsters to rescue my homeboy Eric. Sounds like Grand Theft Auto to me.Anyway, the insane tricks are still here and the levels are huge. If you liked the other titles then you will probably like this one. Some of the ""Story"" is just silly though."
2,Cindy Says Ray,"This product appeared to be beautiful online; however, the appearance in person was not the quailty I was expecting. The suede looked cheaped and the boot colored was too kiddish..."
3,"Cute, Simple","I bought this bracelet to be part of a birthday gift for a young girl. The quality is a little less than expected (then again... considering the price...). However, it is a cute accessory and age-appropriate for a child or pre-teen."
2,Cheap,You get what you pay for. After one week it started to turn my wrist green and the bracelet started to tarnish.
4,good stand for the money,"Good construction and I feel comfortable w/ 61key keyboard on top tier. I use a light weight 88key controller on bottom. Used out live w/ no issues. Easy to set up - There are some cons to this product - It rocks back and forth a little at the base-this isnot a heavy duty stand, but I feel comfortable on stage w/ it. It does take a little time to break down second tier, but it does travel well after everything is folded up. Dont know how it will hold up over time and I probably would buy the heavy duty model next time, but for the price, I think it's definitely a good buy."
3,Just OK,"When I was playing professionally, I used a 3-tier Ultimate Support stand which I have since sold. I just needed something simple for holding 2 keyboards at home and occasional outside use. I was spoiled with my old stand where I could set the distance between my keyboards as close as I wanted plus they wouldn't move back and forth or slide left to right/right to left. This has a fixed height distance between the keyboards which is honestly too wide for me. Also nothing keeps the keyboards from sliding left to right/right to left If I were to start playing professionally again, I would leave this at home and find an alternative. It's cheap and it's OK."
1,this game adapter is bad,"This game adpater is easy to set up but don't believe the lag free part in the desription. I had this up shortly and playing an extremely laggy game on my Xbox. It is faulty and drops the connection commonly. It's not good for playing on the internet but good with other box's in the house. Now, it doesnt even work on the internet i dont reccomend it."
1,lagging at it's best,"if you already have your ps2 wired online.....and think going wireless would be cool....don't do it. i thought the very same thing and bought the linksys ""b"" game adapter. it connects online right out of the box....even with enrcyption on. i mostly play socom 2 online....i was voted off for extreme lag. i don't know if there are anyother wireless game adapters but going wireless with this product isn't what the company advertizes it to be. the company says lag free gaming experience...no....it's lag all the way experience...i haven't tried the ""g"" adapter but don't think i will do so anytime soon.....i'm staying wired."
1,Product was defective,"I got this wireless adapter and simply could not get it to work. After waiting one hour on tech support and then talking to tech support for another hour, they said the item was defective. The instructions that come on the CD are incomplete and you must look up the instructions online on their website.I am shipping it back for a refund now"
4,"Good Product, Good price","The WGA11b is a simple inexpensive way to connect a gaming console to the internet through a wireless access point. Works with Xbox, or PS2 consoles. The WGA11b up to 128-bit WEP security. Can be used with 802.11b/g wireless routers."
3,Decent adapter for a great price,when i paid 20 bucks for this thing i wasnt expecting too much out of it. but it suprised me by being very easy to set up with my xbox. the one problem i've come across is random lag. sometimes it just decides it wants to lag and the lag can last anywhere from 10 seconds to 30 minutes. i play Halo 2 online so anyone else who plays knows what lag can do to you. other than the lag problem it's a great value for 20 bucks.
1,WGA11B Detection Problem,My XBox will not detect the WGA11B at all. I even called LinkSys technical support and they had me doing stuff to the WGA11B through my computer for almost an hour to come to no success. Not a fan at all. Looks like I will be switching to the Microsoft version!
5,"Easy to use, if you don't need WEP.","This is an extremely easy-to-set-up product. Take it out of the box, switch the channel to ""In"" and your up and running. I use it to play Xbox live and it works like a dream! RS3, Crimson Skies, Mech Assault, PGR 2 all work perfectly. For all you people who blame this product for lag, you need to study your technology magazines a bit more. Lag is caused by your internet connection speed, not your wireless network devices. I have a Belkin wireless B router up stairs in my master bedroom and the WGA11B downstairs and the signal strength is excellent. I don't really live in a metro area, so WEP is not necessary here, but from what I've read, the setup for the WGA may be a bit more difficult when trying to configure the WEP. All in all I am very pleased with this product. If you're not going to use WEP, then definitely give this little gizmo a try."
3,"Best available, but not as good as it could be","Easy setup for common, simple situations. The lack of a web interface for setup is a problem for those without a Windows computer handy. The button allows easy selection of common configs, but the Windows utility is needed for WEP or networks that don't broadcast SSID. I haven't needed it yet. Would a simple setup pamphlet be too much to ask? Sometimes it isn't convenient to read the CDROM manual, especially when it isn't obvious there is one on the disc. My unit had the crossover-straight-through switch labelled backwards. Eventually, someone will put a WAN=wireless selection on their wireless router/firewall and make this product obsolete."
5,Easier than expected!,"For all intents I was weary buying this contraption because of the fancier models, but in the end I just plugged it up and turned it to channel ""IN"" and it connected to my network instantly. Not only that it was virtually lag free. The only hiccups it had were when someone was downloading something, but this adapter is the easiest wireless adapter I have ever set up because there are no set up procedures. Just plug and play; exactly what it claims on the box. Don't spend twice as much for the same performance. This is the best deal."
3,Wireless-B Game Lagger,"wow.when i first put it in.It ran beautiful.not logs.so clear.Then it just broke up and lagged to heck.It happens all the time.You play a few games.that are beautiful.then it lags for the rest of the time.Maybe its my internet but im sure i have good internet.It lagged before i had this,but this lags more often and worse.Plus what about the setting up.It took some time.Overall its good and about 60 percent of the time its lag free.the rest its as if the product name is the Wireless-B Game lagger. If you had super lags and fixed it.Please tell me by emailing me at Packer_fan_1254@yahoo.com"
5,A great option for the XBOX 360,"I have two of these and had been using them with my regular XBOX and they worked great. I then got a 360 and decided to give it a try, and am I glad that I did. It works just as it should no lag at all and I didnt have to buy a 100 dollar USB one for my 360! The internet is not like a truck, you just cant dump things on it. It's, It's... a series of tubes!"
1,Forget it if you use WEP,"Do yourself a favor and get a WET11 instead if you use WEP to secure your network. I thought I'd save a few bucks and get this instead, but after two units and less than stellar documentation and tech support from Linksys I still could not run the configuration utility to set this up for my network. I have a WET11 that I used for another device that is easily configured with it's web interface. The WGA11B has a Windows only program that refused to recognize the adapter when run on my laptop. I could use it out of the box if I turned WEP off and enabled broadcast of my SSID, but who wants to run that risk. Maybe it's something with the configuration on my laptop, but Linksys tech support was of no help beyond suggesting I return the first unit (which I did) and when the second didn't work any better I just decided to save myself the hassle and return it."
1,WGA11b,I purchased one of these and could not get it to work with my current linksys wireless products. I called 3 times to the technical support number and no one could help me. The product worked in ad-hoc mode but would not connect to my router with wep or in infrastructure mode. The setup is easy although you have to use the linksys software and it looks like it only supports windows pc's. I also returned one of these to Amazon per the Linksys support team and received another unit. It responded the same way. I hope this review helps.
2,ehh,can't get this to work with my 360.. turned off all security on my home network.. this adapter will not even talk to my network.. i can't figure it out.
5,great product,unit was easy to setup. only problem i had was I put the mac address of the adapter into my wireless adapter`s mac filtering allow list. if your using mac filtering like me make sure you enter the mac address of your playstation network adapter. not the wireless game adapter. connection was pretty good. had a few issues with putting it in a good location so it wouldnt disconnect. pretty much plug and play like the package says.
3,Compatibility issues,"I just recently purchased the WGA11b and wasn't too excited to see that the set up was not as EASY as they claimed. After speaking with someone working at Dunkin' Dounuts, I come to find out that there are some compatibility issues with my existing wireless network, which tech support failed to mention. They didn't have a clue and the guy walking me through it was lost. Although, it works fine if you have a Linksys Wireless network there are issues getting this to operate properly on a more sophisticated wireless system."
4,Linksys WGA11B Wireless-B Game Adapter,This device works just fine with the PlayStation 2. I had no problem going online or playing head to head with two playstations and two Linksys wireless adapters. It works with my Linksys router and it works with with a 3com router; I don't see why it wouldn't work with any other brand. You plug it in and go. The hardest thing you have to do is select the proper channel by pushing a button. It comes with a CD for your computer that explains the setup and checks your settings so you don't have to be a geek to hook it up.
2,Trust me. Go with a cable!,"I was very excited to get xbox live not too long ago.. and instead of running a bunch of cable (my xbox is across the house from our computers) I thought I'd go wireless. Well I have to say its about the easiest thing in the world to set up. Plug it in and go, its as simple as that. Thing is, is I could not get a clean game very often at all. I play Halo 2 and I had terrible lag almost every game.. At first I figured it was just my internet, and then I thought, maybe it was my wireless. Well one day I decided to just buy the cable and run it across the floor to see if it'd work better. To this day I have yet to have a bad connection. I don't know if it's because of how far I was (about 25 feet) or what but I never got a good connection with this thing."
1,Defective Product,"This is my first time to buy Linksys product but it is defective when I receive it. I worked with customer support for 2 hours and talked to 3 people. First person worked with me for 1 hour and the phone line got disconnected and he never call me back even he have my phone number. I called back again and I told him what happened and he just said "" please wait, I will try to pull your case out"" then put me on hold without ask me for the phone number or anything he can look at. I waited for 10 minutes and still on hold. I ues another line to call in and third person just help me to create an case and told me just return the product and get a new one. meanwhile another line is still on hold...I think I just be unlucky to get a defective product but the customer support is so ....Forget about the linksys, try other brand. Maybe better.."
1,Are you a rocket scientist?,"I have a BS in Computer Science and 10 years experience. Now, my experience is mostly on the software side and not the hardware or network configuration side, but still, I'm no innocent with electronics.I never got this thing working. I have heard of people getting it working. I have even heard of people getting it working with some security on their wireless network, so I know it's theoretically possible. However, I have seen a lot of messages on message boards with some pretty smart people trying to get this thing to work and having a devil of a time."
4,Works with WEP and MAC filtering (updated 2007),"Didn't buy from Amazon but recently purchased. Setup is simple -if you have another PC-. I don't think you could really set it up without one. Anyway, my base station (not a Linksys) is about 50 feet from the adapter and it works like a champ with WEP enabled, but does not connect if I have MAC filtering turned on (I have added both the Linksys and the PS2 Network Adapter MACs to the setup, but it just won't connect).(2007 update - this filtering-doesn't-work issue was due to my ignorance of the device. The WGA11B does not present its own MAC, it presents the MAC of what it's plugged in to. Once I added the MAC of the PS2's network adapter everything was fine. This also works great with the XBox 360 but again, add the 360's MAC, not this device's.)Handy and cheap. There are cheap 80211G products now but if you see this one for cheap pick it up (unless you've got a T1 you're not getting 54Mbps on the net anyway)."
3,This is tons of good info. but do u need to...,Do you need to buy the ps2 network adapter or can u just plug this into your ps2 or xbox and start playing?
3,Does it work on the Xbox 360?,"i just got the new xbox 360 not to long ago and now i need to get on Xbox live, only problem is that my 360 is in my basement and my router is on the top floor. I need some sort of wireless thing, so does this work with the 360 and is it easy to use? if not can someone tell me some wireless gizmo that does other the the oficcial xbox 360 wireless, which is too expensivethank you"
1,broken,"the day i received this product, i opened it to find that it was broken and i had wasted almost 30$ on it."
3,Linksys WGA11B Wireless-B Game Adapter,I used this as a wireless bridge for my replay TV. It worked great after I threw away the cd that came with it and downloaded the lastest software from the website.
5,Nice wireless Gaming adapter,i bought this product 7 months ago and it works great with my xbox 360.and is very inexpensive .
3,Cheap Alternative,"This is a cheap alternative to the the solutions that the game manufacturers offer at a premium price. It was somewhat of a pain to install as it is a little confusing, but once configured, it works well."
3,Wireless game adapter,"It's not bad, but I can no longer get it to work. It needs some way to determine the strength of signal it is receiving."
4,Great Adaptor,"I got this adaptor in August of 2005 and it works great. I have had very few problems with it since then. I use this adaptor to connect to xbox live and it works flawlessly. However, about every two weeks it just disconnects for no apparent reason. I then just use the troubleshooter and it works fine. I don't know if this is caused by the adaptor or by the xbox, but aside from that it works great."
1,"Junk, Junk, JUNK!!!!","I bought this with high expectations. I have a Linksys wireless network set up in my home. I can take my laptop pc across the street to my neighbors house and surf the net. I hooked this adapter up IN MY HOME, 20 FEET AWAY FROM MY LINKSYS ROUTER. Know what? IT KEEPS DROPPING THE DANG SIGNAL!! Tried playing SOCOM II over and over again, and I kept lagging out. I bought 2 hawking high gain antennas for my router, my laptop has a 100% signal, but this stupid game adapter just will not connect strong enough. All it does is lag out. I am returning this, and either buying a Linksys WET11 Wireless Ethernet Bridge, or just running cat5e cable to my living room. I am 100% dissatisfied with this Linksys product, and I would not recommend it to anybody. Not even my worst enemy."
2,Not ready for prime time!,"Well, after hours (literally, hours) on the phone with Linksys tech support, I was never able to make the product work. The Linksys support people finally ended-up blaming my router (a D-Link product) for not communicating with the game adapter. The router was working fine, from everything I could see.Support was OK, once I got through the army of people who didn't understand that I was using a Mac (after explaining it over and over again...really not a factor in the performance of the product). Support was off-shore, and they took a LONG time to answer the phone.I know this technology is relatively new, but if I can't get this thing to work (I'm not a computer newbie by any means) then good luck to anyone who takes the plunge with the WGA11B.I would really suggest another manufacturer (FYI: D-Link customer support, once they answer the phone, is top-notch)."
3,It works but its chatty....,"It works like a charm, I use it for my xbox. And for the review that said that you couldnt use mac address filtering, add your console and you bridge to the list and it should workMy big gripe is that I have to reset the little fella quite often. If I go turn on my xbox right now, it wont connect, I will have to unplug my adapter and plug it back in and try again. Once I do that it works fine, but crawling behind my TV everytime getts annoying.I also noticed that when it is plugged in it lags my wireless network to a crawl, the enitre thing, but once its unplugged, the network speeds right back up."
1,Horrible,"This thing was horrible. I bought it to play online through XBox Live. Even sitting on the router itself, this thing didn't even pick up enough signal to run a laptop's internet. Don't buy it. It's a waste of money and you can get something better for cheaper if you look."
3,"eh,","Im not going to say its a bad product but im not going to say its good either. The first one I ordered wouldnt reset for some reason and it locked me out and set it prefs to some weird settings. Amazon gave me a replacement(and quickly I might add), And it seems to be fine except it wont connect to my Netgear WGT624 wireless router. I think its a compatability problem but im not sure. I know I set all the settings right(im kind of a techy guy) but it just will not connect. If you have my router I dont suggest getting it but otherwise, from everyone elses reviews, I wouldnt say no. Because of my problems and others reviews, I have rated it 3 stars(medium rating)."
1,Crappier than an outhouse,"If 0 configuration is good for you, than you might like this. If you want to use WEP, tie this to a brick and throw it through the Windows of Linksys' offices.I basically had one of Linksys' drones tell me that disabling SSID, WEP, and MAC filtering were overkill and that all I needed to do was enable SSID broadcasts and disable WEP and everything would work.The software is crappy and can't even reliably connect to the device. Look elsewhere for a wireless game adapter."
1,Does not work with X-Box,"This product is supposed to be compatible with the XBox, but from my experience it definitly is not compatible. I spent the better part of a day trying to make this adapter work. When I tried to configure the XBox to use a wireless network, the XBox could not recognize the adapter. When I left the XBox settings as is for wired networking, I could not get the adapter to connect to my router (a Linksys router by the way). I tried to call technical support, but I could never get through. After going through three levels of voice menus, I received a busy signal. I returned the adapter the following day.I do not plan on buying anymore Linksys products in the future."
1,OUTDATED PIECE OF HARDWARE,First of all if you don't have a computer w/ Windows XP you can't run the software. Secondly you have to change your security settings to WEP.... which was top of the line in 1999. This means your network is going to be less secure.
2,Making this thing work right is a well-kept secret,"Every once in a while, Linksys gets it right. This was not one of those times. Their setup procedure isn't even close to being right. I had to go online and chat with a linksys tech, and he set me straight on how to do it. I'll outline it here for you and save you the trouble:Set your computer to a static ip address of 192.168.0.005Plug your WGA11B into that computer's LAN portRun the WGA11B setup utility.Please note that this WGA11B will only work with WEP security.There you have it. Once it's configured it works as advertised.jrv"
3,WORKS with 360. connection is SUB-par,"This item does work with XBOX 360. The connection however is not very good. I have my system on a different floor of my house. I find myself in a match of Gears of War and everyone stands still, then my connection is gone. This happens repeatedly throughtout the day. Sometimes I cannot even reach the dashboard to DOWNLOAD demos; or even check mail because it is loading or something. I think I would go with the More-expensive Microsoft Equipment.Nice product though."
2,For Xbox go with the MS Wireless Adapter,"I've configured my fair share of wireless networks, so I figured this would be a snap. Unfortunately, nothing could have been further from the truth. I plugged it into my *Linksys* router so I could configure it, and it couldn't get an IP issued. I was going to hook it up to my XP box and enable DHCP on it, but the instructions for doing that were 4-5 pages long. In the end, I had to set the SSID on my wireless access point to default, turn off WEP, and then configure the thing wirelessly. That, by the way, is not recommended by Linksys.I finally got one of the presets to work with my custom SSID in place and WEP turned on, so I'll be nice and not give this thing a one-star rating. I do recommend you just purchase the Microsoft Wireless Game Adapter. It's almost twice the price, but at least you can configure it through the Xbox OS with any hassles."
4,Works Great on the XBox 360,"I purchased this item to connect my XBox 360 to the internet, and I have to say the product works well. Lag is minimal, except when initially connecting to XBox Live.The only real problem I have with the device is the difficulty I had installing it. For whatever reason, the software that it comes bundled with is defective; I attempted to connect to the device with my computer but kept receiving a ""Connect failed!"" message. I had to download it from the Linksys website after rummaging the internet and finding that this problem is a common occurrence. I was also disappointed to find that it only supports WEP encryption, not WPA; I had to change my WLAN security settings just to be able to use it.All in all, however, it was a short time to set it up and get online. I recommend it, as this device is half the price of the Microsoft wireless ethernet adapter for the 360."
5,A Spanish classic,"Too bad this DVD has not been released in the US. Mortadelo and Filemon is a series known to most Spanish kids, as popular there as Mafalda for Argentineans or Superheroes for Americans. This movie is GREAT and a lot of fun, not only for me, who grew up reading their comics, but also for other kids (and adults) whom I have shown the film. Highly recommended, you will have a lot of fun. I hope a Region 1 DVD comes soon..."
5,An Amazing comedy that will make you laugh from start to finish!,I first caught a bit as i was flipping channels. I ended up watchign it and laughing till i had tears. It wasnt till the second time WITH SUBTITLES that i realised that i had missed the main plot and it still didnt matter!Be quick on your spanish!!!!
4,ducati desmoquattro superbikes,"Informative, and even more so to US readers, who are not really getting the true Ducati Exotica available,albeit in very small numbers, to World Ducatisti.At least through this book, some of the not so available info on the 916 family bikes is explained. What could be improved? more info on the 998 . All in all, still a great reference book for Desmoquattro fans."
3,For Engineers Only!! Very Technical Book,"I'll start this by saying I am a die-hard Ducati fan. I've ridden the legendary 916 and have a pretty diverse riding background--albeit mostly sportbikes. This is an extremely technical book--fantastic pictures, but the written portion is equal to a captured discussion with the bikes technical designers. No comments about ride feel, acceleration, all statistics are embedded in the text. If you want to know the evolution of the diameter of the sub-frame through each model year, this is your book.All in all--a good book with loads of detail--just think you need to be a gear-head or true mechanic to appreciate the development, design, and structure of the desmo engines."
1,"Great Sound, Terrible Interference Problems","Got these as a gift and love them for the great sound. For the size, sound and bass exceed my expectations. But it did not take long for the first interference problems to occur. First the occasional ""POP"" then ""hissing"" and ""crackling"" noises. This can be loud and happens intermittently for no apparent reason. Most annoying when you are trying to go to sleep. Many times I had to unplug the speakers to silence them. For that reason I'm selling this speaker system.Absolutely unacceptable for a major brand name, shame on Altec Lansing.Positives:1) Great sound for size2) Simple and easy to useNegatives:1) Unacceptable interference problems2) No ""OFF"" switch for the sub woofer3) Speakers tethered together limiting placement and routing options"
2,Bad Interference,"I agree with many of the reviews of cell phones interfering with the speakers. I have had both a RAZR and now myTouch from T-Mobile and the phone being within 5 feet of the speakers causes interference, totally unacceptable in my opinion. Other than that, the speakers work well and sound great, but I would not get these again."
2,Misleading Information,"These speakers are fine for the price; HOWEVER, if you are looking for shielded speakers, look elsewhere. While in the product description it cites ""magnetically shielded"" as a feature, I have had trouble with my GSM phones (AT&T network, both a Sony Ericson and iPhone). The sound quality is decent for the speakers, but the interference from GSM handsets makes these speakers an affordable, yet unsatisfying choice."
1,Serious problems,"Ever since I got these speakers, I've only had problems with static and radio signals being picked up. I called up the company, and they recommended moving the speakers away from my wireless router--well, the wireless router happens to be in a different story of my house, so I just don't think it can get any farther than it already is. So, basically the customer service person told me that this problem could never be fixed and I'd just have to buy a different set of speakers. Well, I'm never buying Altec again."
2,Static is obnoxious,"These speakers work great in my brand new dorm, where the power supply is presumably perfect. In my 15 year old house, however, they buzz loud enough to hear over most music. Truly obnoxious. In both locations, they click and buzz from cell phones and for no apparent reason (me and my roommate theorized bus and cab radios), and they occasionally picked up Christian talk radio very softly, even when turned off. None of this ever happened with my old Cambridge 4.1 system. Nice sound when they get perfect, interference-free power, though."
1,Worst buy I ever made,"When the unit is turned off, there is a lot of noise comingfrom the speakers, as long as it is plugged in the wall. Hadto disconnect the system from the electric plug at night time- otherwise I could not fall asleep ;)Then, I tried to connect my guitar effects to the RCA inputjacks. However, I could barely hear any sound coming throughthe speackers, even if I turn it all the way up. I'veused the same setup to connect my guitar effects to my stereo,and no problem there, so I know it's this unit.Wanted to return this [...] the next day, but could not findmy receipt. Shucks. Now I've taked the unit to the office,assuming the noise would be less annoying because of our officeair vents. Nope. Noise is so bad, I have to unplug the systemif I don't want to listen to music.For $50, I'm sure this is a very very bad buy. For $50,any other alternative is most likely a better buy that this.Beware.And if you choose to go against this advaice, make sure youknow where you keep your receipt."
5,Small studio like's 'em,"I needed to replace some PC speakers and took a chance on how these would sound in my small home studio. It is one thing to mix through the headphones, but another just sit back and listen to speakers afterwards.Nice quality sound for $50! I do not need to crank the volumn, but occassionaly you need to. Handles well for what I need them. More than appropriate for mp3's in an apartment. Good studio playback. They just simply sound good... Listening to them now ;)"
3,Nice sound up to mid ranges but too much interference,"This is a very affordable, attractive pair of speakers that I bought for my new Dell. They aren't as loud as my old Altec Lansing's, which were actually THX certified but went with the old PC. However, the middle range sounds are very clear and crisp and the bass is more than can be expected in this price range.The real problem is the interference I get. I think it's from my neighbor's TV. Anyway, what sounds like a TV station comes through the left satellite very faintly. Which means I have to turn my volume up higher to make sure I hear only my music. It's not ideal so I'm probably going to take them back.However, if I didn't get interference they would probably be a delightful set of speakers for most computers. I'm going to cough up the $150 and get a 2.1 set of Klipsch instead."
1,Consumer beware!,These speakers will interfere with certain cell phones. For my cell phone (GSM; Nokia) loud clicking noises would come from the sub-woofer. This was even more annoying since the power on the speakers does not get rid of the static. Do not take the chance and get speakers that are not annoying. I bought the `Logitech X-120 Compact Powered Speakers' and they were properly shielded.
3,Good sound and bass levels.,"I use these at work and only have one complaint, since they don't have a ground prong on the power cord, it picks up radio stations.I radio station problem is rare, my guess is that I live in Florida where it is always around 95% humidity and with that, seems to make the radio stations barely audible if masking it 100%.I find that the speakers ""clicking"" because of my cell phone is actually a plus. I know that is weird to say, but the thing is, my speakers will start clicking softly before my phone even rings. It is like a little alarm saying, ""Incoming call, locate your phone."" The clicking volume is based on how loud your speakers are set at. An added bonus is that when I have my phone on vibrate, I can hear the clicking from the speakers even when I am in the next office over. No more client missed calls."
3,Nice sound but I've problem with static sound too.,"Good sound quality, I don't have much to add to above review, except that in my case I found out what was a cause for the static sound. It was my cordless-phone base. If I move it away from power cable for at least 20 inches than everything is fine. Spent almost an hour trying to figure out what was the cause of the static sound and was about to return them. Other than that I'm happy with my purchase.Rating would be 5 if not the static sound problem."
1,avoid at all costs,"this is the worst set of speakers i have ever owned. the quality itself is not bad, but as the other reviews mentioned, they pick up EMI very easily. they are so senstive that i have to turn off my phone every night to avoid being awaken by these speakers. (i don't like turning off the speakers, because the only way to eliminate the buzzing noise is to unplug the power, but every time u plug the power back in, the speakers make a LOUD popping noise. what's ridiculous is that even the manual mentions the ""known problem"", but altec lansing still decides to sell this p.o.s.) i've emailed and called tech support about the buzzing sounds caused by cell phones, but they offer useless advice like using ferrite beads (which i tried and they did not work). save urself frustration, time, and money by not buying these guys. if u really want them, i'll be glad to sell you my set (if i haven't gotten rid of them already)."
1,Avoid! AVOID!!!,"Bought these 6 months ago, was pleased for a week and then the interference began. Every cell phone in my or nearby apartments set off a loud buzzing noise and even when the speakers were unplugged from my computer AND the power outlet, radio interference at easily-audible levels was present. The manufacturer offerered not a replacement but the suggestion that I purchase some ferrite beads to rectify the problem. These are speakers I would wish only on an enemy.(Postscript: I went back to my retailer and they gave me a terrific deal on some Logitech X-230s after hearing my story. They were cheaper than the Altec-Lansings and are as quiet as all get-out. Good sound, too.)"
4,Excellence!,"Great attention to detail. Prose that borders on the cinematic. Glad I found this, and even happier now that I've read it. Required reading for all Lincolnophiles."
1,Terrible software difficult to use,I use mapquest online frequently so i though it would be nice to have a program on my palm TX that didn't require internet connection. Product came with just DVD and 1 very small instruction sheet that was no help. There was no number for support. Also online manual is extremely basic and doesn't do a good job of explaining how to work it. I finally figured out how to get it up and running but its so slow and I have it on a large 1gb memory card. Causes palm to run real slow and the program frequently freezes.
2,Poor interface and no documentation,This product is difficult to use and runs slowly on a Palm Tungsten E2 with a 128 mb MMC card. There is no documentation for the Palm application and only a short help file for the desktop application.
3,Legend of Mana....deffinetly not a sequel,"After reading many reviews for the game prior to purchase, once I did buy the game I immediently went in, not expecting it to be like Secret of Mana. I think that is what saved the game from being utterly stupid. DO NOT expect something like Secret of Mana...the only similarities are the enemies you fight, and the mention of the Mana Tree (which is part of the 15 minute story in this game.) I do admit that I did enjoy it while I played, but after beating it in only 15 hours, I was expecting so much more, not as a sequel to SoM, but just as an RPG itself! Where is the story? Besides, this game is way too easy for a veteran RPGer. I would honestly only recommend this game if you are bored easily and need some time to kill. I wish I would have rented it instead that way I could finish it in a weekend and not have had to waste $ on it. Dissapointing...."
1,Save your money,"alright this is one of the LAMEST games i have played since Yoshis Story. the ""side quests"" are in all respects worthless, and you don even need to do more than half of them to beat the game. the ending leaves a lot to be desired as all it is is a fight with a VERY easy boss that will take you 5 minutes. The game has a ""New Game +"" feature like Chrono Trigger, but the game is already so easy noone needs THAT feature. If your looking for a childish RPG that will take u about 15 hours to defeat (as opposed to Final Fantasy games which take at least 60), then this game will STILL be a worthless use of your system"
1,This game is BORING...,"When I got Legend of Mana, I expected much more. For instance, I thought you would go right into the game like in Secret of mana. Instead there is five minutes of boring text, then you must wander aimlessly arund a town. Also it is impossible to get the second artifact or to get into an adventurous area.In short I am saying, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GAME."
4,A different twist,"Playing Secret of Mana a while back, I was a bit anxious for this game to arrive. Although it does differ greatly from the original, it still keeps some of the basics as well as adding a new twist to the game. The very non-liner style to the game brings new challenges. The other great features of the game are it's customizability with weapons, pets and golems. They aren't required through the game, but are left for you to decided if you need or want them. The game itself is not a great RPG, like those with the status of Chrono Trigger or Final Fantasy, but it is a stepping stone for those of us that need something to do between Chrono Cross and the new FF games...................."
5,Couldn't put it down!,"Great game. Really unique combat system. You get to move around slashing everything in sight. Basically a bunch of quests rolled into one game. If you love side quests this is the game for you. Lots of partners, pets, and even golems! It even has a 2 player mode so you can beat up a giant crab while talking about which quest you'll do next.Only one word can describe this game,GREAT!"
1,Dissapointing follow up to a great original,"The ""Secret of Mana"" was truly a graphically outstanding and originally plotted take in the rpg/quest theme; so much so that I looked forward to the ""Legend"" worthy sucessor to what I hoped would be a series of the caliber of ""Final Fantasy."" But this tedious second installment lacks the visual excitement and fast moving storyline and action that maked the original exceptional. A sense of adventure is missing, and game just isn't challenging."
2,An Ok game if your bored.,"This game was pretty kewl at first, but it gets anoying after a while. Secrate of manna, the first one, as WAY better. The game is pretty mushy. It's like reading lots of different childrens books. The game ends pretty easy, and fighting bad guys is no big deal. It has no main plot. You just go around helping people like a boy scout or sumthing. You can do the game over and over. The only way to do ALL the challanges is to buy the guide book."
5,BUY THIS NOW!,"This is an awesome game. Period. Even though it is not the same at all as Secret of Mana, it is still a great game. If you .............. want agood game, and are reading this review, click add to shopping cart now!"
1,Lame game,"Not what I had hoped for. I nevr played Secret of Mana, but I'm sure it was better then this sequal. All the game is, is mini quest after mini quest. It has no solid story line that can be followed. I'd of expected better from Squaresoft."
1,How dare them squaresoft people wreck the mana series....,"This game [stinks]! It's so [dang] boring. It ranks up there with saga frontier (another stupid game). The graphics [stink], the storyline is boring and the gameplay/controls [stink] too! Don't even look at this game, go play Secret of Mana for the SNES. That's the best game ever, too bad Legend of Mana had to ruin it's name..."
1,Difficult to Play,"I can't say that I liked this game. I enjoyed the original SNES game, Secret of Mana, but this one was nothing like it. The dynamic questing system is confusing and difficult to understand, and I'd totally lost the plot by the time I was an hour or two into the game."
2,Legend of Mana? Legend of the Bore,"I love RPGs they're very constructive and many of them have a good plot. I play all kinds of rpgs and i don't discriminate them if they're graphics are lousey or their music stinks as long as their story is off the wall. Being a mana fan that was what i expected legend of mana to be. Of course my expectations were shot when i played it, it is the most depressing game out there, you a play a soulless protagonist who goes on depressing adventures, which for the most part end up in a sad ending. The worst is when you have to face the last boss man why they make us fight that person i don't know. It truly destroys the beauty of the mana series."
4,Almost 5 Stars But Not Quite...Still Good Though,"This game is not like Secret of Mana in many ways. First off, there are many stories and adventures in this game that are fun but not really focus on mana. There are a few that have to do with mana but that's it. This game is extremely easy but it is still pretty cool. I liked how you could chose between 2 characters in the beggining and there weapons. This is a good game for begginers in my opinion. If you are looking for a different game get this one. I recomend."
2,"Flammie, we hardly knew ye","I've read some of the other reviews, and, frankly, i'm glad i only rented this game. It was amusing for a time, and i did think it was moderately enjoyable to have and train a pet rabite, but the rest of it was just painfully easy. I think a little modification of the battles to make them harder might have gone a long way to improve this game. The reasons why I gave it a two rather than a one, or a zero (which is what i *would* have given it at first glance) is because some of the stuff that can be done at the home is interesting. I like the idea of building weapons, as well as instruments, and the pets, like i said. But...That can't make up for the rest of the gameplay. That would be like someone buying FFVII for the Chocobo Racing. And...I missed Flammie. ::laughs::"
2,"Good, In A Way","Seeing that Secret of Mana makes you jump up and down at the thought of a seqel, Legend of Mana is really not as great as people say it is. On Secret of Mana you could walk around freely and attack at anything almost anywhere. On Legend of Mana, in battles, can only attack left or right, even though you can move in all the directions. And the innovative surfaces are pointless, the way you have to wait to get an ""Artifact"" before you can move to the next town. And the storyline, I mean, what storyline, this game is just boring. I was so excited at fist and even fought with my brother to play it, but now it's gotten pointless to play, and there's nothing new. Trust me, don't believe those who give this game 4 or 5 stars, this game isn't worth it, no matter what company it's made by.--Patrick Browning--Game Dude"
1,This is not your Father's Secret of Mana...,"First, I have to say I loved Secret of Mana (and most other Squaresoft RPG's). This one, however, has nothing to do with Secret of Mana in any real way. It doesn't even really have a plot. Rather, you run around and solve a lot of little sub-plots with little story of their own and all seem way to easy. Some ideas are cool; you can raise your own 'pets' to go adventuring with and build Golems and some items, but its not enough. Fight sequences are simple and boring - quick blows with one button, heavy blows with another, ""special techniques"" (NOT all that special) can be hot-keyed with the other two. Certain abilites you learn can be added to the top buttons.Over all, this game would probably be good for the 'under 10' set, for anyone teenage or over, forget it!"
1,Beautiful graphics don't make up for boring battles,"Yes, the graphics are pretty. Yes, there's a complicated weapons/armor creation system to master. BUT, who cares when the battles are so boring that it becomes painful to play the game.Sample battle: your character, moving slow as mollases on a winter day, runs into 3-5 enemies who move slighty slower than you. ""Run"" up to the first, hit it a few times, kill it. Repeat with the others. Do this for 30 hours to beat the game, at which point you'll get to a harder level where the weapons/armor creation system finally comes into play.If that sounds about as fun as slamming your hand in a car door over and over, well, you'd be right. Save your money, rent it first to see if its for you."
4,this game rules!~,"I played this game back on snes!!! the game on playstation is just awesome! i read a lot about music selection in rpg's, but i dont really care about the music. the graphics are pretty cool. the characters are pretty cool. the only thing i didn't like about this game is at first i didnt understand how to play, but after i figured it out it was fun!!!"
3,One in a series of PS disappointments,"This game was odd at best, and really not completely worth the time it took to complete. I expected more from Square, at least they redeemed themselves with Final Fantasy IX."
4,Gotta go No Future Mode!,"I beat this game relatively easily the first time that I played. True, it has little plot (though it does have a couple important sub-plots), but fighting battles seems to be what Square was most concerned about.My favorite thing about the game is that after you beat it, you can play on No Future Mode which makes the game MUCH more challenging. All of the old enemies are level 99 and new ones appear at level 76 or 86 depending on the enemy. They are also a whole lot stronger. If you found it easy the first time through, play it again on No Future Mode for a challenge.Overall, it is a good game, but it is very easy to get annoyed with the AI. The computer controlled characters are so STUPID. They don't get the experience coins and only attack when you are trying to get one of your special techniques off."
5,College Algebra,I am takeing algebra in college and this book is an excellent help. I highly recomend this book to anyone who needs help with algebra.
5,great book,"recommend you to buy it if you just got into HIGH SCHOOL, else, it's useless since pretty soon half of the book will be covered"
2,Out of Date,"Last revised in 1997, the Outline of College Algebra has not kept up with the content of current college algebra classes and textbooks.The treatment of logarithms is archaic. There is no discussion of exponential equations or logarithmic equations. Solving exponential and logarithmic equations is part of any good college algebra class and textbook, and is a fundamental skill required for calculus, science and engineering. Lacking these topics, the Outline is not a complete supplement or study guide for college algebra classes."
4,Schaum's Outline of Theory and Problems of College algebra,"This book was received and will be shipped by my USA contact person, I will elaborate more on this item when it is received in Belize."
3,Disappointed,"I'm disappointed. I read over reviews for a number of similar study guides and settled on Schaum's Outline of College Algebra in hopes of quickly reviewing before a placement test I need to take. While the book covers a lot, and I do mean a lot, of different topics, there are a lot, and I do mean a lot, of typos and inconsistencies in the set up of the text chapter to chapter. The typos in the steps to solving a problem are the worst. And sometimes, in the ""Supplementary Problems"" section, instead of leaving all of the answers to the end, they put them right next the the questions. Annoying. So far, I've skipped one chapter all together because the text made absolutly no sense. Maybe they're just teaching things differently these days (I doubt it). Overall, I'm disappointed and will try to find another study guide asap."
3,"Helpful, but many typographical errors","I've been using this book to brush up on (and, in some cases, learn for the first time) certain important Algebraic concepts before my Calc II class begins in the Fall. I can't yet say how well it's prepared me - but in most cases, the explanations are lucid, and examples do much of the talking quite well when the exposition is far too dry and concise.One warning: The book's riddled with typos. No, x^2+8x<15 is not equivalent to x^2-8x+15<0; y^2=4py isn't the equation of a parabola; etc. Bear this in mind when going through the Conic Sections chapter, where - for some reason - it editing seems to have been especially bad."
3,"Good, but could've been better...","I purchased this book when I enrolled in College Algebra in the hopes that it would be a good reference guide to use if I was unable to grasp the concept of a particular problem. Instead, I found that it was basically echoing what my textbook was saying. I was hoping that Schaum's Outline of College Algebra would break things down into basic explanations, but instead, I remained lost."
3,decent for its price,"book has decent material for its price, however i am finding a lot of errors as i'm working thru this book. there's an error on pg. 169 sect 17.4 parabolas(1)y^2=4pyit's supposed to be y^2-4pxthat's an error in the example used to teach the concept,not just a small error in the samples. although there's plenty of errors in the sample problems as well.use this book to review like i am, it's got some decent proofs in here but not all of them. check out www.wikipedia.com for extra information on proofs on certain sections.overall for $12, u can't go wrong, just make sure to use it as a review, and remember the book has errors."
1,Too brief,"There is such a thing as too brief of a review. If you want tutorial help in solving problems more then the easiest, this is not the book for you."
2,lawn mower blade,Bought this blade and noticed it was very flimsy. The metal wasn't very thick and during the 3rd time i mowed i hit a small root. It was badly bent. Went to local walmart and bought a 22inch Gator Blade on sale for $14.97. It is a good thick blade. No problems have hit a few things and it held up. My fault for hitting root but i think the blade shouldn't have bent as bad as it did.
4,One pretty good disco album.,"Why this album isn't on cd is beyond me. How is it that Chic and Sister Sledge material can manage to make it to compact disc and Norma's album couldn't. The song's ""Saturday Night and High Society"" alone are worth having this cd. I have the vinyl at my house and i have ""High Society"" on a 12 inch single record, which i copped back in the day at a nearby record store."
3,YOWSAH??,"Nawsah! Forget the bonus cuts. Gimme the 6-minute, 6-second version of Saturday...any-day!!! This is the first CD I've bought in a long time just for one classic cut. The remastering gave my speakers a sonic jolt, and I can actually hear Luther Vandross in the background!! Liner notes excel, as well!! Too bad the 11 other cuts were mediocre."
2,"Book is okay, but arrived damaged.","There was no packing in the box, and when the box arrived it was crushed, and the book has major damage to the hard cover."
4,Good,Good book. Definitely assumes that the user has some spanish exposure. Only powerful in a class setting.
3,Required Textbook,"I would like to see a spanish book with more explanation between english and spanish. Most books rely on pictures for translation and this book follows the same model. I guess it will serve the purpose, however."
3,It's ok,"I picked this up to learn Spanish over the summer. I'm pretty good with languages but if my girlfriend didn't speak Spanish as a native, it'd be a little frustrating to learn from only the book.It's a decent book and the presentations and practice sentences are well organized. My criticism is that I am often reading words that are not defined in the book and without a native speaker next to me I wouldn't know what I was reading. Of course a Spanish/English dictionary would fix this problem, I was use to language texts that provided everything you needed in the book when I learned Japanese."
4,text book,A book used by my daughter for 9th grade Spanish. Helpful and well used. Useful in more advanced Spanish classes.
1,Traditional grammar-based text,I am a Spanish instructor and find this book to be terribly outdated and traditional. It is poorly organized and doesn't promote real communication in the target language. I also find the vocabulary to be incredibly poor for a college-level text.
5,!!! ... !!!,This album is simply amazing. For a trance enthusiast to pass up this album would simply be foolish! Superb trance having the ability to do just what trance stands for. (Feel high without the drugs) That good!
4,good 3rd or 4th book,"i found this book very helpful in offering some specific ideas on how to detox the body. That kind of info is completely absent from your typical 1st book on autoimmune disease, and most MDs have little to offer in that area as well- just drugs and more drugs to counteract the side effects of the initial drugs. This book gives some specific ideas on things to try, and how to go about implementing those ideas. I found it refreshing not to hear yet another voice tell me to expect to just be on and off prednisone until i eventually need a new set of kidneys, and that there was nothing I could do about it.If you've just developed an autoimmune disease, then this is not the first book you want. there are lots of good first books with solid info in them.I'm not connected to the author in any way. Just a reader."
1,alternative therapies,"This book was not helpful at all. It stated many controversial treaments and one major misconception about lupus. Lupus can not be cured- it goes in remission until next flare up. I would not recommend this book for anyone unless you prefer ""half baked ideas"" that do not work. Some of these can be dangerous and/or create more pain and suffereing for lupus patients.I feel my money was wasted on this book."
3,much appreciated,"There was a slight problem in delivery, which was taken care of by the seller.The book was in very good condition and included a personal touch that was much appreciated."
4,gr8,this baseball case was a gr8 find for the price. in the local stores round here you would pay the same price for jus a base and the glove part and would have to worry bout dust getting on the ball but witht this case u eliminate the dust problem
5,Great Retro Items,This was a gift for a couple who are decorating their entire place in 50's Retro style. It looks great on their kitchen table and they love it. Seller gave good service. Items were well packaged and arrived in a timely manner.
3,It OK,"This toy was not quite what I expected. It is hard to get the thing to work, wich of course ment that my son lost interest. So when all is said and done we ended up throwing it out after about 6 months."
2,not up to standards,"Batteries were dead in it, and can't find the right batteries for it, and the ones that are close to them are expensive!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Horrible Writing,"Frankly, I am loathe to even give one star to this foolishness. There may very well be a good story buried in this book, but I couldn't find it because of the horrible writing. The character is supposed to be based on the author's grandmother who apparently is not only endowed with ""super intelligence"", an ""uncanny sixth sense, ""great physical strength"", ""a mystical sense of justice"", but she is extremely beautiful to boot! How ridiculous that the character lacks ANY flaws if it's based on a real person. Not to mention that the author switches from 1st to third person and the primary and secondary characters within 3 or 4 sentences so there is no continuity of thought. Just mangled ideas on a page. Horrible, just horrible. I literally threw this in the garbage after I trudged through the first chapter. This is THE biggest waste of money I have ever spent on a book. This author is incompetent as a writer and I do NOT recommend her book(s)."
3,It's ok,"Wanted a pad that would blend in well with my desk. This one does. Performance wise, I can't say that I think it's worth twenty bucks. Guess I had to bite the bullet to get a wider pad that looks good."
2,Not so good with a laser mouse,I bought this to use with a logiTech MX620 laser Mouse. It has a few areas where the mouse won't work over. The pointer just stops until you get past that point. Very annoying. I have looked at the surface of the mousepad and it looks fine.I would not buy again
1,Don't waste your money on this cheap piece of plastic,"First, you will notice there is no way to open the package without either cutting the cardboard or plastic which makes this non-returnable according to their return policy and no refunds allowed. Second, you will notice the thin layer of plastic they are calling a mouse pad comes with a similar cut piece of the same stuff placed under floor rugs and used to create non-slip rugs, no genius there. Third, you will find you have to attach these plastic sticker-like feet to the bottom of your mouse to get the best performance they say. And fourth, last but not least, the edges are really sharp and uncomfortable to the wrist and hand. This is just a cheap piece of plastic cut to resemble a mouse pad. Nothing more. Don't cheat yourself and think you can get something which will satisfy you for so cheap."
1,Pathetic excuse for a dog toy,"Yes, you heard me. In the description it says that it is built to withstand 'rigorous' dog play. My 10 month old cattle-dog puppy (not a terrible chewer) had the thing ripped open in 30 minutes. 24 hours later she had removed all the stuffing (we were supervising her, of course) and the squeaker toy (which didn't even work in the first place. If you are looking for a dog toy that looks kind of cute that can 'withstand rigorous play'--look elsewhere, you will be very dissapointed with this toy and I presume others from this company. Two days later (right now) the insides are gone and the cover is shredded. Combat tested, it said on the package....now what exactly does that mean?"
1,Beware,I was excited when I bought this toy for my cairn terrier because he loves soft toys but destroys and destuffs them within minutes... they toy looks tough...and sounds tough but it is not... the seem come up and the stuffing comes out. Pick a different toy
2,Not so much,Unfortunatley my dogs ate this in under 24 hours and had little blue and white threads everywhere. Ballastic material maybe but not German Short Hair proof.
3,Big Jaw Cinder destroyed this toy,"It took just 15 minutes for Cinder to tear an arm open. She is a 70 pound Boxer / German Short Haired pointer who loves to unstuff toys. It took just 15 minutes for her to start pulling stuffing out. The good news is she has been playing with it for 3 weeks and it still has some of the stuffing in it. It has lasted longer than any of her other toys, but it's not indestructible"
2,"My Dog Loved It, But...","Sadly, they don't last. My dog loves these toys and the first one I bought him lasted around a week and a half, which was a record for a 'soft' toy. He got another for Christmas, and had it torn apart by the end of the day. Very disappointing."
1,Chewed it up in under 10 minutes,My two year old Golden Retriever chewed thru this toy in under 10 minutes. I bought it because it was suppose to be indestructible and it is not!
5,Fun for all poodle lovers,"I guess that the best way to describe this book is as a cross between Eloise and Dr. Seuss.The illustrations are adorable and I wish that I could have a print to frame of Poodlena primping and ""pinking"" herself up.This is a darling little book that I would recommend to all poodle lovers, young and old. [If you've never been owned by a poodle you wouldn't understand.]"
1,Not worth the effort,"I'm a huge Lovejoy fan, but Jonathan Gash should stay on his side of the pond! California Game is just not worth the effort and also not worthy to be called a Lovejoy mystery alongside all the other great Lovejoys."
5,Good Strong Soundtrack,Bought as a gift--thanks! I know the music has been listened to many times over.
5,It *IS* Chaiyya Chaiyya,"Wow - I sit down to watch the movie and the song starts off and I had goosebumps the size of tomatoes. I *LOVE* this song and it was awesome to get another movie theater rendition (The last being when we last watched ""Dil Se"")."
1,Inside Man CD,"Disappointing! We bought the sound track of Inside Man for the specific cut, ""Chaiya Chaiya"". After hearing the droning theme for 26 cuts, we finally heard Chaiya Chaiya...not the pure version that starts out the movie, but rather a rendition interspersed with Rap! Since we are NOT Rap fans, we were sorely disappointed.Any ideas where we can obtain a CD with the original version and unedited cut of ""Chaiya Chaiya""?"
1,One trick album,"I only bought this album for the track ""Chaiya Chaiya"" (which was used for the closing credits). The rest of the album is plain boring and if I could have bought the one track somewhere I would have."
1,"Recycled music from ""When the Levees Broke""","Some of this music is from the 2005 documentary ""When The Levees Broke"", a Spike Lee documentary about New Orleans in the aftermath of Katrina. I was disappointed to find this music recycled for a movie. It takes away from the haunting backdrop it provided for this very poignant and serious documentary about my hometown. Maybe Mr. Lee is trying to make a point by using the same music but I wish he'd left the original music alone and let it stand for only one film."
1,I was expecting songs that play in the move,"I was expecting songs that play in the move especially one sounding like Indian, but made a mistake bough original soundtrack composed by Terence Blanchard. Be careful when you buy this CD not everyone will enjoy it. It is not something that played in the movie!The music is not exciting and not that great from professional point of view!"
2,"One purchase, One CD, One Song","If you're looking for the CD that has ""Chaiyya Chaiyya Bollywood Joint"" on it from A. R. Rahman, then you found it. It's an addictive song. However, I should've paid more attention to the description of the Inside Man CD. It's a score, not a soundtrack; meaning there are blips of instrumental music punctuated by only one memorable song. If you're interested in musical scores, then perhaps you will appreciate it. If you're interested in Chaiyya Chaiyya, then spend more time searching for A. R. Rahman and be willing to explore other Bollywood soundtracks and compilations. I'm wary of CDs now that don't allow for downloading individual songs or don't provide a preview of each track. As for Inside Man, I loved the movie and continue to press replay on Track 27."
5,A hidden gem!,"This was a surprise soundtrack, i.e. ""score"" to a surprise movie; both were beyond expectations in complexity and nuance. The ""world beat"" sound of this is astounding, I can (and have) listened to it over and over again, finding something new each time. This is a complex melange of urban edginess and driving rhythmic undertones by an accomplished and, in my opinion, overlooked musician with still unplumbed gifts. Well worth the price for a gratifying piece of listening enjoyment."
2,satire this?,"When I was a lad of some 12 years of age, I enjoyed this and all the others in the series. Now, after reading much science fiction, I am bored to tears. Satire is wonderful only when it serves a point and this does not. The first couple of books were and still are enjoyable. However, when we reach this book I fear it has degraded into a bloated work that goes no where. We've already seen countless times that psych is evil, sex is perverted, and countless other replayed points. I reread up to this book and just couldn't go on! I suppose if one treats the series as a source of cheap thrills it's not all that bad. I for one would rahter listen to Zappa's catalog for some good old satire whit and inteligence."
2,He might have already died before he wrote this one.,"Some of L. Ron Hubbard's books have been fun to read. Battlefield Earth was great (not the movie) and well worth reading. His self help books like ""Dianetics"" are somewhat facinating and do have some worthwhile quotes, like, ""never read past a word that you don't understand"". Mission Earth is downright insulting to our intelligence in some parts. Try Herman Melville if you want to understand humanity."
5,Grossly adorable monster chef.,Not for the those with a weak stomach. :-) but my two-year-old boy loves it! Really cute and 'gross'
5,love this book :),"it`s funny and has just agood amount of text for a short bedtime story. my 4yo loves this monster and his name and the story and also, that the flies escaped :D (mommy loves the story and the pictures)"
2,Lasted Four Months,"This MP3 player was a very good price/performance choice. My platform of choice for loading it is my Ubuntu Linux desktop, but it worked equally well from Windows. At 2Gb, it held all my current podcasts plus a couple of audio books.Unfortunately, one month past the warranty expiration, the device expired. It will no longer boot, nor does it turn on when plugged in to a USB port."
2,Broke shortly after warranty expired,"Started out as a great, super handy player - but about a month after the warranty expired the on button is stuck and the player no longer works. I wouldn't give this as a gift to anyone ...."
2,Poor construction,"I got a Coby MP3 player this last September because I happened to need a USB drive, a cheap voice recorder, and a temporary MP3 player (while waiting out the release of the iPod touch) after my old one broke. ""All in one for a reasonable price,"" I thought.Unfortunately, it no longer works as an MP3 player because the ""play"" button (the most important button on the device) broke. It's stuck and there's no way to get it unstuck. It's now useless as either an MP3 player or voice recorder.I only give it two stars (instead of one) because I can still use it as a USB device (though it's a bulky, awkward one compared to others of the same storage capacity)."
2,Cheap But not upto the mark,"I wish I get time to upload the real photos of this mp3 player. I'll try to be brief and to the pointPros:1-Price is good and affordable2-Directly plugs into the usb (no need for cable)3-AAA batteries (no worries that the li-ion gets dead after some time)4-Multiple colors to select for its lcd in the setup.Cons:1-The worst thing: Max. volume is actually very low on my sony-mdr headphone or any other 'good' headphones.2-While playing music, i can't see the progress-bar (as i see in the product picture), i can only see this bar while recording. Text size on lcd is way too large as i compared to what i see in the product picture (and i've found no way to configure these things in the setup)3-Headphones that come with it are pathetic and dont reflect quality at all.4-No option to upgrade the firmware yet5-Shiny but still dont gives an appealing look. Shape is not uniform from the back.--"
4,His best before the storm,"When Black Flag ran out of gas in the late 80s, it took Henry Rollins six months to get this band together and running. This is THE Rollins Band album to buy, considering his body of work before 'The End Of Silence' came out.This is the still poor, angry, we can make this band work Henry. Hard, angry, and not too poorly recorded. I love this album, all the tracks. But I only give it 4 stars because of the missing original CD track 'Joy riding with Frank', a 25+ minunite live track that had the best bass guitar work I have ever heard on ANY rock album.Either way, its a great buy. Its funny, back when I bought this album around 1988, I couldnt think of Henry Rollins singing for anyone other than Black Flag. Now, listening to this album, considering Black Flags later work, it sounds like he was wasting his time with Black Flag, waiting to make this album, and when he did, he exploded. Recomended."
4,next best rollins band album,"next to ""life time"" i find this disc to be their strongest.its raw and heavy, but also experimental and very uncomfortable and in your face.like all of rollins work, this is not for well adjusted folk, or people who see the world through rose colored glasses. the lyrics and vocals are intense and direct, and take a strong look inward, in an attempt to strip away the bull. songs like ""what have i got""(i like the demo version best), ""turned inside out"" and ""planet joe"" are great genre shattering music.again, most people wont get what rollins is talking about, but if you are any bit open minded, check this out."
5,A Legend,"Here is a solid compilation of Ernest Tubb; a true Legend of Country & Western Music. Folks, Ernest Tubb was authentic, and that is what music is all about.....especially Country Music. Noone did more for Western music than ET, and his contribution to true Honky Tonk will never be measured. The fact that he gave us Jack Greene and Cal Smith are enough, but his own style of doing a song changed our music forever. This album is just another great release by 20th Century Masters; and the recordings are original. In fact, you may think they are too original....as a few of the original scratches and fuzz still exist. Of course, this album contains ""Walking the Floor"" and ""Waltz Across Texas"", but even more impressive is the inclusion of ""Drivin Nails"" and ""Two Glasses Joe""; as well as one of the first true male/female duets of ""Sweet Thang"" with Loretta (Conway had nothing on ET). a truly enjoyable listen."
4,The secrets revealed...,"Tiger Ellison. Mouse Davis. June Jones. John Jenkins.These are names we have associated with the Run and Shoot. Love them or hate them, these guys have been a part of the revolution. The Shoot is explained in detail in Coach Black's book. The key to making this offense work is the adjustments and reads made at the line before the snap and after the snap. Coach Black pays special attention to these adjustments and the QB and receiver techniques involved."
4,She had a name!!!,"What I like about this book is that it gave a history to the wicked witch in the story The Wizard of Oz. It is the background story of Elphaba, the wicked witch of the west. I loved it!!!"
4,laramies great entertainment,ageless and a delight after all these years what a joy robert fuller and john smith are brilliant.Amazon.com are always great to deal with.I recommend Laramie The Final Season
3,Laramie - The Final Season,While it's great to have this set - I assumed - incorrectly - that it had been worked on - this doesn't appear to be the case.The colour seeps in places and fuzzy at times as well - these are minor quibbles - for a series I have not seen in years - as I said - I'm pleased to have the chance to view and own this DVD set - just don't expect it to be perfect
2,laramie-final season,"they did not do a good job at all,to much money for what you get,pictures, stinks,they need to do a better job with restoring this series,one of my favorite westerns,they should have never let it go like this,do a better job next time"
1,Terrible Picture Quality,"I did read some reports of poor picture quality on this set of DVDs and what swayed me to buy it was that some other reviews seemed to suggest the quality was ok - well, let me tell you that the picture quality is terrible - every DVD looks like it is a poor copy of a VHS tape with grainy and faded video and poor colour reproduction - at times it is difficulty to see an actor's face properly due to all these issues.I was lucky as Amazon have now fully refunded me the prurchase cost of Laramie: The Final Season and I have suggested to them that they withdraw this product from sale as I am sure that any buyer will not be happy with it."
1,Laramie: The Final Season,"I purchased a brand new (6disc) dvd entitled ""Laramie The Final Season"". It was of poor quality. I contacted the seller and advised them that I was not happy with the product. They advised me that they had not personally viewed the item before and that if I was not happy with it, they would provide me with a refund once they received the item. I returned the item and paid an additional $12.00 shipping fee. To date, I have not received a refund. Sincerely, Helen Scherrer"
2,Region 2,On upon purchasing this movie I figured it was a region 2 movie because it would not play. I believe it didn't specify that in its advertisement. Again on returning items the purchaser has to pay for the sellers errors.
1,SPANISH VERSION NOT PLAYABLE IN U.S. DVDs,THE PACKAGE GIVES NO HINT THAT THE ENCLOSED DVD IS NOT PLAYABLE EXCEPT IN EUROPEAN DVD PLAYERS. THIS AMOUNTS TO AMAZON'S EASILY AVOIDABLE FALSE ADVERTISING. THE VENDOR SHOULD BE STRIKEN FROM AMAZON'S LIST.
2,Other authors have done it better...,"I liked the voice of the main character, Cupido Cockroach, in the beginning of the book... but the tale lost its drive after Cupido converted to Christianity and the story was taken over by a local missionary. Somewhat saved in the last chapters, but not enough. Other books (""At Play in the Fields of the Lord"" and ""Black Robe"") explore the darker shades of bringing Christianity to indigenous groups with far more power."
4,Some of the best riffs ever,"I've been a fan of Dan Lorenzo's guitaring back to his work with Hades and Non-Fiction. I feel Dan sort of inspired much of the downtuning sound that became so popular. I wasn't sure what direction to expect with his solo stuff, but once I heard the powerful riff in ""1974"", I was hooked. ""1974"" is probably my favorite cut on the disc. It is an aggressive song with great vocals that just draws you in. ""Bocca Della Verita"" is a unique instrumental and ""You're Out"" probably has one of Dan's best riffs ever. Some of the biggest metal bands out there should hire Dan to write riffs for them."
5,These are Blue Fox not Silver Fox,"The coats that come up in the pictures are gorgeous examples of blue fox (Alopex lagopus), not silver fox (Vulpes vulpes). Blue fox is so plushy you want to walk on it barefoot!"
2,Fur= Cruelty,"I'm sorry if I offend you, but fur is cruel. For foxes, they are brutally electrocuted or skinned alive just for their coats. Please take pity on them and do not buy fur. And for the dog and cat owners out there, most fur comes from China and have some stray dog or cat fur mixed in. So have mercy and and don't support the fur trade! Thank you :)"
3,Item as described,"The nozzles with the tips are of cheap quality, just simply dropping them can bend them beyond use, so either be very careful with them or buy better quality air blow guns."
5,a must-read for playwrights,"This book is smart, pragmatic, hilarious, and full of love. Garrison's willingness to bare himself, to use his own successes and frustrations and hard-fought wisdom to instruct and encourage--it adds up to a profound act of generosity. As if a toughened-yet-still-passionate playwright-pal is pushing you to stay focused, to smarten up, and, most important, to pursue your work... What a great gift he's given to his fellow writers!"
4,Excellent vocals.,"Some of the best vocals of any recording. Mystic Harp has a pleasent beat, but it is the powerful vocals that seperate it from similar recordings."
3,Not what I was expecting...,"Knowing of Mr. Bell's work with the Chieftans, I purchased this disk as a gift for my wife, who plays folk harp. We were both expecting to hear more in the way of his virtuosity on the harp, but instead feel that it is overdone with too much synthesized, sterile-sounding electronic oboe, flute and strings which detract from the harp itself. If you are looking for traditional Irish or Scottish-style harp performance, this would not be one of my recommendations. Instead, you may want to investigate Catriona McKay. If, however, you like music more for background which doesn't challenge your listening, then you may like this one."
3,REPRINT,"You may be interested to know that the reviews you are reading are from a previous edition of this book, and that this edition is a reprint. CAVEAT EMPTOR. The Scotch Whiskey industry is constantly changing. Nice photos yes... current information? i hope so."
3,mouthwatering photography,"thanx for tour,always browsing for something new. sorry but ill never quit sippin JACK DANIELS,the one true love. all made in of all places,the hills of Tennessee."
4,Listen to it 3 or 4 time before...,"When I listen to Craig Armstrong. I need 3 or 4 listen to know if I will like the cd or not. Because the first listen is always bad and too much repetitive with craig.We need sometime to know the songs.This New Cd ""As if to nothing"" is great...but I have buy the soundtrack of 'Collector Bounce' in 1999, and some songs are very similars to it. (Like the first one, Hymn 2 and the choral ending).Best song on the cd: Probably: SnowI Don't like the song of Bono (too boring...) But the rest of the singers is great.If you like The space between us, you will love this cd."
2,Obnoxious and Overly Dense,"Like the Reviewer before me, I too found this album to be inconsistent and annoying. The tracks had too many layers of things going on that didn't match. My wife made me turn it off during ""Miracle"" because the chanty vocal was totally out of tune with the rest of the track, and the incessant blipping in the first track was very uninspiring. ""Wake Up in New York"" was a fine piece of work, as well as ""Let it Be Love"". But Craig shoulda saved the experimental tracks for the end. Craig also isn't good at findig new sounds for his tracks, utilizing the same string preset for the past two solo albums. Oh well, I always have his classic ""Space Between Us"". Nice."
5,The Magna Carta,This book was donated by the East San Gabriel Valley Republican Women Federated to the Covina Public Library. The Book was chosen by the Children's Librarian.
3,Good But Cheaply Made,"After moderate usage, the protective foam which holds the mic's stem began to slide and fold until I had to remove it an replace with the furry side of Velcro tape. Fortunately, this has worked for a good long time."
5,De Lubicz's masterwork in a stunning two-volume set!,"De Lubicz's masterpiece, available for the first time in English, has been giving a beautiful translation and presentation.While not for the faint of heart, it is required reading for any serious student of esotericism, hermeticism, sacred geometry or ancient Egypt.In all honesty, I haven't yet finished this two-volume set (it's a massive, dense, thought-requiring work) but it's impossible for me to imagine my opinion changing radically once I do.Surely, this is one of the most important works of the 20th century."
5,REQUIRED READING,This wonderful book is required reading for all those who care about women (and especially for those who only CLAIM to care about women)
5,If Only More People Cared,"If 10% of women cared even half as much about women's rights as MacKinnon & Dworkin, we'd be living in a much different society: A society that values women as humans, and not as animals whose purpose is to ""service"" men."
1,MacKinnon and Dworkin give feminism a bad name!,Anything these two men-hating individuals write is suspect
4,Works,"I've used Dynamat for the last 10 years or so, and it works very well to dampen sound on anything I've used it on. Keep in mind, this is not supposed to be visible, it goes in between panels on your vehicles body, where it cannot be seen."
3,its okay,seems to work well but sure didn't cover as large an area as I thought once you cut it. Be prepared to buy an extra roll.
5,It works,"It works and is easy to use, just cut to size peel the backing and stick. You can press it down by hand or use a roller."
5,TRUNK RATTLE!!,"Of course you dont hear it inside your car. The booming bass has you reaching for your earplugs. But crank your decimels, step out and walk behind your car. If your trunk sounds like your phone on VIBRATE FROM HELL...then you need this product. More then enough in this package to handle your license plate area and some spots in the trunk. PICK THIS UP before you have to do the same to your license plate"
3,No Big Effect,"I used this on the interior walls of the air chamber of my fireplace insert to absorb the blower noise. I did not notice a dramatic difference. It is on the bottom of the plenum where the cool air goes in, not in the top portion. There were no problems with odor or melting from the heat radiating through the bottom. I don't know what would happen if I burned wood without turning on the blowers."
4,great vibration dampening for anything,"i used this in my computer and it pretty much KILLED every kind of vibration that existed before i put it in there. great stuff.warning: its like tar, or bubble gum. its not a solid rubber. its like you spread liquid rubber on tin foil and it never completely hardens.only complaint about this product: the foil is UGLY. i wish it was black. i would pay extra for black."
2,no longer the standard,"This book started out with good intentions, but is so laughably out of date that it is hard to read with a straight face. The section on windows does not even list vinyl as one of the options. It might be a good starting point for someone with no experience, but it is past time for a serious make over."
2,For people without internet and/or common sense,"This short book has a few insights in it, but overall I didn't find it very useful. Perhaps this is because it was published almost ten years ago and I was able to get much more information than what's in this book by searching the web. The book is mostly redundant and vague -- it doesn't seem to present enough real research to be helpful to parents or professionals. Its message can be summed up as follows: We don't really know anything about the effects of prenatal drug exposure, so parents have to prepared for both the good and the bad."
1,Good for one year only,I had this vaccum last year and at first I was very happy how it operated perfectly out of the box. I had planned on using this every 3 months to keep my carpets clean. At about a year after purchasing it it just stopped working.At first it just kept on dispensing hot water without control. I stopped and checked if I had the water tank improperly attached but it isnt. A week later I tried it again and it stopped dispensing water all together.I dont know if I just got a bad one but I suggest getting something else other than this vaccuum.
1,Disappointed in FF5520 SteamVac Duo Vacuum,Since this was a Hoover product I was confident that I would receive a quality vacuum. I was very disappointed in this steam vac. It continually leaked and made a bigger mess of my carpeting then I already had. The machine itself was flimsy and I thought after a few uses would fall apart. I returned it after one use. I would certainly not recommend this item.
1,Piece of junk,I got this vacuum as a wedding gift. I used it a couple times on my burber carpet and thought it did an ok job. The water it picked up was dirty so I figured it was doing something. As for spot cleaning with the attachments... it didn't do a darn thing. After a couple of cleanings I dont' think the vaccuum works well at all. I'm about to throw it in the dumpster to be honest.
5,Mighty Little Duo,"I just used my SteamVac Duo for the first time, and I was very pleased with the results. After buying two hand-held spot cleaners and not being satisfied, we decided to bite the bullet and buy a steamer. The Duo is excellent for our fully carpeted apartment. We have two dogs and needed something for their spot creations. As gross as it might sound, being able to smell the nasty spots being infiltrated by the Duo's steam was quite rewarding in the war against doggy odors.I had no problem with the telescoping handle being flimsy. I found it quite manageable and actually easier to handle than most vacuums. It seems almost made for a woman! The tanks were easily filled and emptied as well. No struggling with hard-to-release latches.As far as the Duo goes, I am 100% satisfied with our purchase. No complaints in this spot-free household."
4,Went in the garbage,This was a good product at first but lasted little less then a month and then went into the garbage. I have had much better luck with it's replacement which is a Bissle product. I'd now give it no stars.
3,Cute but not practical.,These were hard for my daughter to keep on. Super cute and comfortable but not very practical.
3,Pam's review,"This is a nice product, but it is not user friendly. It takes awhile to get it to do anything that you really want it to do. Music notation has so many varying steps to it, that I think they have done a good job with it, all in all, It has some little things in it which could be greatly improved...such as controlling your own measures (bars) a lot more. There also needs to be a way to erase each little segment individually. If you change a note, the way they have it, the lyrics change and the chord also. Each part should function separately. Pam"
1,Disappointing,"I bought this book to give to my kid for information on the French and Indian War. This was a mistake. The book tells almost nothing about the history of the War. It is just some stuff that goes on during the war, but it is not what the title suggests."
1,Just a compilation of worthless stories,"This very short (64 pages, only 50 of which have direct info) book on the French and Indian War does not cover the war in detail, but merely has a collection of historical letters and reports on various topics like: women, disease, a skirmish, etc.... Even for an introduction, I think this is a poor choice."
5,Rita Coolidges beautiful clear voice,"Rita Coolidge has a beautiful clear voice. Her pitch is perfect and she has an instinctive emotional delivery. I have wanted these song on CD for a while now .I am very glad this CD was produced. I have worn out the cassette tape with the James Bond Theme ""ALL TIME HIGH"". I also have the three ""Album"" she and Kris Krisofferson produced together and wanted a sampling on CD and ""Loving Arms"" is perfect for this. Of course her remake of the oldie ""Higher and Higher "" is a favorite. It takes real maturity and self-assurane for an artist to tackle Oldies. Her style is one-of -a -kind. This is a wonderful collectors CD."
4,Rita's Voice Shines,"Though the Twentieth Century Masters collections always tend to be a little short--I for one would love to hear some of Rita's work with Kris Krisofferson--this one works. It focuses more on Rita the R&B diva, and it does a good job in showing her versatility as an artist. She moves convincingly from duped victim of love in the very un-R&B Carpenters' classic ""Superstar"" to Jackie Wilson's homage to soul-stirring love, ""Higher and Higher,"" while never losing the warmth and sensual strength that makes Rita such a great interpreter. All in all, worth adding to the music shelves."
4,Lovely Rita....,"Rita Coolidge put a spell on my in my school years. ""You"" was one the favorite dancin songs of those days in my town. I bought this record basically for this song and ""All time high"" cause hey gave a nostalgic memory of my younger days, but the whole record is full of great shiny perfomances by her. ""We are all alone"" completed the treat for me but all the songs are great. She had a marvelous voice so polished for the tyoe of music She did, thay sometimes She Away the music. For any casual music fan this will be a welcome adition."
4,not like her concert,We ordered this after seeing her in concert. The CD is nice but just doesn't compare to her concert. I will probably order a different DC and hope I like it better.
4,Excellent hits collection plus a few treats,"Rita Coolidge has a pleasant and soothing if unexpressive voice, but on a track like ""All Time High"", she lets her voice soar and it's a knock-out. The other genuine standout on this excellent hits collection is ""I'd Rather Leave While I'm In Love"". She sings the melody the way it should. I've heard far more imaginatively arranged, energetic and superior versions of her biggest hits (""Higher & Higher"", ""The Way You Do The Things You Do"", etc), but they're pleasant enough. That's the way singers did them in the 70s and Rita's no different. Whereas ""We're All Alone"" succeeds in this style, ""Fever"", ""You"" and ""One Fine Day"" only come across souless and mechanical. Then, there're a couple of treats for fans like an early live version of ""Superstar"", on which her voice sounds oddly wobbly, but you don't complain 'cos it's honest and touching. This is as good a Rita Coolidge hits collection as any available in the market."
2,The Hits Are Not The Best of Rita Coolidge,"The trouble with any collection of Rita Coolidge hits, is that Rita's hit singles are not her best recordings. Her cover of Boz Scaggs' 'We're All Alone' is her best ""hit"", and the lovely 'Id Rather Leave While I'm in Love' is another highlight. It's also interesting to hear Rita's live recording of Leon Russell's 'Superstar' from Joe Cocker's classic 'Mad Dogs & Englishmen' tour, Rita's very first recorded performance. But after that, there's not much here to recommend these tepid, radio freindly singles. You're better off getting her early 70's Rock/Folk albums, before she went adult contemporary, or her terrific 1998 return to her roots CD, 'Thinking About You'."
3,Pretty good representation,"To the casual listener, some of these songs may sound a bit dated, being that most of them are from the late '70's. But it's hard not to find tracks like ""Higher and Higher,"" ""The Way You Do The Things You Do,"" and ""You"" infectious. And she still has a way with a good ballad (""Loving Arms"" is a real treat)."
3,"classic Rita, Coolidge price","Nice compilation of tunes. My favs ""we're all alone"" ""Id rather leave while im in love"". Hey every dude has to have his share of love songs (otherwise he would be alone) and no better decade for love songs than the 70's. I like Rita's soft voice and the music is well written. I didnt care for the inclusion of live performances on a studio cd, but thats just me."
3,Keeping cool in the demanding e-development world,"If you're about to start a new software development project, it's worth reading this book first. It will help you make some sense of today's demands on you that software development should be fast and iterative while meeting ever-changing requirements. James Highsmith offers and explains concepts like ""adaptive"" and ""emergent"" and explains what to do with them in real life.It's not a complete how-to book, though. While it has a lot of detail, be prepared to read it and discuss with your co-workers to figure out what part of the ideas you may be able to apply on your upcoming project."
4,B. J. Thomas Greatest Hits,A good collection of B.J. Thomas's original hits from the 1970s. They seem to be the original recordings. They do not include some of the lesser Billboard hits.
4,Discus Breeding for Beginners,Purchased it for my husband to help him gain more knowledge on a breed he had not yet bred. He has read the book and thought it to be informative and helpful.
4,Buy it just for the pictures!,"I am a beginning fish hobbiest and am debating getting into Discus. I didn't expect the book to be terribly in depth (only 64 pages), but what I wasn't expecting were the fabulous pictures! Good info, great pictures."
2,Fine for young children,I purchased this along with the Breeds poster book but was disappointed in the quality of the photos. You could so easily tell that they had been altered mechanically. In the style of Robert Vavra but way behind in quality. I was sorry that I bought this one for my horsemanship camp students. The very young set 6-8 did like the magic and the unicorn but the older kids found it corny. High quality paper and the possibility of tearing out the pages as posters are why I gave it two stars. This is nice for decorating a room with if you have a younger child but like I said the alterations are too visible for an older child.
1,Unsure about this book,"A lesson I re-learned about purchasing this book is to pay attention to the reviews, many of the reviews say that this book is full of errors, the reason for buying this book was to learn from it now I am unsure what is correct and what is error, it is amazing a person can put out a book with errors and profit from it."
3,Bad directions to many of the hiking trails,"I have chosen over a dozen hikes from this book so far, and I have to say the driving directions are not very good. 3 of the trails I could not even find- after driving for over 1 1/2 hours, I gave up and just went to stinson beach with the dog (waiting patiently in the back seat). I have lived in the Bay Area for 15 years, and like to think I know the area pretty well- but this book made it difficult!The trails I did find were great."
2,Disappointed,"This book covered many areas, however, didn't go into enough depth. I would have liked more trail detail, wildflower, wildlife information."
5,Great high level overview of Gauss's Life,"This was a great overview of Gauss's life and career. I have an engineering background and used Gauss's mathematics during my college days and engineering work. This book was written so that one could read and appreciate it with a very limited understanding of algebra and trigonometry. I knew very little about Gauss's life before reading this text, and I am happy with what I learned about him.This book gave several brief examples of how Gauss thought about math problems as a young man. For example, the author describes several mathematical problems that Gauss solved in a very unique way compared to his peers (e.g. quickly finding the sum of all integers from 1 to 100). The book contains descriptions of how a young Gauss approached and thought about his unique solutions.Several areas of Gauss's expertise were only briefly described (e.g. his work on magnetism). I would have liked to have had more technical detail included as an appendix to the text."
1,Gauss: Price of Mathematics,The book is suitable for school going children with anecdotes. It is not for serious study for understanding work of Gauss and why he is Prince of Mathematics. US$ 19.95 is price of the book and is not worth the value.M Satyanarayana
1,Cheaply made filter,Ordered three filters - one looked like it might be the right wick filter. Other two were flimsy and appeared to be more like a dust filter for the back of a electronic item- thin and flimsy. What a rip -off!!!!
1,disappointing,I had order this product previously and I was shocked at how it has changed. It looks extremely cheaply/poorly made. I just hope they work.
2,Paul Anka Gold,"What I want to know is does anyone know of a CD collection that contains Paul's original ABC hits from 1957-61? There used to be a label called Sire which had such a collection but unless one can find it as vinyl in some used record store, its unavailable. Its a shame, because the CD thats on my left, the ""21 golden hits"" version on RCA are all remakes, which sound terrible. Even Paul, I've read, regretted making it."
5,fantastic,I love older music im only 15 yrs old and love old music but paul anka is probably my favorite thats all i listen to is older music.
2,Alas,"Strinberg's plays unfortunately represent the worst tendencies of theater; they are long, ponderous, trying-to-be-profound, depressing messes. I say so not to insult his native Scandinavia, which produced many wonderful artists (Grieg, Munch, Tove Jansson, Ibsen on his good days) who are more deservedly remembered than Strinberg."
4,authentic look,"I really liked the wig, as a woman trying to dress up as a man for Halloween, it looked pretty real. I did have some problems with the texture at first, it would not lay like it does in the picture. But with continued patting and combing it worked out very well. Thank you."
4,From Dumplings to Teddy Bears,"Mimi is a delightful little monkey who is visiting her grandmother. Together, they count items including jars of honey. cans of food. flowers, fingers and toes until they have counted from 1 to 10. The warm and humorous illustrations show the close relationship between Mimi and her grandmother.The format of the book makes it a very practical and durable book for preschool and primary grades students. The pages are heavy glossy paper, the pages are stitched together with small stitches, and the strong covers can easily be wiped clean. This format makes the book one that will be durable through many happy readings."
3,Now exactly delicate,"The gem wasn't as dark as I had hoped for but it was still a pretty stone. I guess my gage of the size wasn't correct but it was a pretty giant rock when it arrived. My issue with it was the setting. While I knew it was a roped band, I wasn't expecting it to be so wide and so huge... it looked really massive (and unattractive on my finger).This is not a ring for delicate fingers. I liked it but had to return it since it didn't go well with my hand..."
4,Good value for the money,"The ring was exactly as advertised. My wife enjoys wearing the ring, so everyone is happy!"
5,Intense and Provocative,"Broken Child is a story of tragic loss and pain suffered at the hand of an otherwise ""should be"" doting mother. The author does an indescribable job of putting her horrific experiences on paper. For anyone who's ever experienced abuse, we know this can be an extremely challenging task. Ms. Cameron does this with such precision and attention to detail that it's frightening. I found that I had to read the book in public so as to not become so engrossed in the details that I ""lost"" myself. Very seldom does someone come along who can so adeptly describe the very horrors of life that the rest of us would just as well forget or ignore."
2,"Sorry, didn't like this book - read on to see why","In some ways this book is very valuable for those who wish to know what kind of monsters there are out there; the graphic descriptions of her abuse are heartrending and effective. However, from a personal point of view, this book made me angry; Marcia Cameron remains a victim throughout most of the book and blames it on the others in her system. I know this is normal, but I never got a sense that she saw her alters as anything other than persecutors who hurt her; if she ever reached an emotional understanding of how they helped her it didn't show up clearly in this book. I also had a problem with the way she basically denounced anyone who recovered memories (as opposed to having had them all along) as fakers of some kind. As a source of information on the effective of abuse on a child, it's excellent; but as a representative of other multiples, it falls terribly short."
3,"""Carrie's"" mother revisited","I was both repulsed and intrigued at the same time while reading Marcia's story. How could so many ""sane"" adults have ignored the ongoing symptoms of physical abuse, especially her father. I found myself wanting to cuddle and comfort my own children each time I would sit down to read a few chapters."
3,So So,"This one was a decent read, no doubt about it. But the doctor who treated her wasn't very with it in terms of multiplicity. He treated the other people in her system down right disrespectfully. Sadly, he seems the norm among many therapists."
2,questionable story of abuse; too much,"After reading this book, I found myself wondering how so much could have happened to one person, starting with the child abuse and going on to numerous rapes, etc. While these things evidentally did happen, they happened with such alarming frequency in the book that I started finding it all hard to believe. The Kennedys have nothing on Cameron if this book is entirely true."
4,Wow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I never played a very real game before! I can drive,walk and climb walls now! It has very real sounds! You sould get this game."
4,Great if you like to skate,"Being a skate boarder myself, i thought this game was awsome.it had some good levels and some great tricks. more with more levels then T.H.U.G.2 it takes a litle longer then the 2nd game. but beat it once and it takes an after noon to do it again. so go for this before you thing bout T.H.U.G.2 and you'll have a great time......."
4,"Excellent, but with some minor flaws","This game is without doubt one of the best sport games ever. It is really fun, and you can create your own parks, decks, tricks etc. The story is great, and you get to play as your own created player. One of the coolest things on the game is the fact that you can get off your board and walk around as well as drive cars. The graphics are superb as well as gameplay. My only complaint: it's too easy. This game is really easy to beat although it is fun in the process. Don't get me wrong, the story and goals are great, they just really needed to lenghthen them to make it harder. My point: it's fun to beat the frist few times, but it gets repetetive."
4,"Very fun, but loaded with flaws","This is a good game overall, but it still needs a few improvements that weren't made in Tony Hawk's Underground 2. Let me name a few:- when you ditch your vehicle, it should stay in the exact place you parked it, instead of going back to the place you found it.- there should be a wider choice of vehicles- you should also to be able to enter more buidlings- there should be a couple of pro skaters tearing up each level with you so you're not completely alone- the levels should be bigger and more detailed, although Hotter than Hell can't really get more detailedAlthough I've named many flaws, this game still deserves a 4.5/5, which is equal to 8.75/10. If these improvements are made in the next Activision skateboarding game, (whether it's Tony Hawk's Underground 3 or Bam Margera's underground, which I think would be a 10 out of 10 game) I will definately buy it.Rock on!!!!!!"
5,A comprehensive discussion of headache cause and treatment.,"This 1992 volume while written for the physician is an invaluable guide for the lay person suffering from severe headache. It does require familiarity with basic medical terms and chemistry. The chapters on migraine, cluster and tension headache are particularly useful. Highly informative on causation and treatment as well as abortive and prophylactic drugs, their efficacy and side effects. Contains summation of a number of research studies. As useful as ""Headache"" by Neil Hugh Raskin, and more current. If you are plagued with incapacitating headaches this is a worthwhile investment."
4,Classic Marvel,This felt like an old school Marvel comic with a modern edge. I liked it a great deal.
4,Great art!!!!! Story......... better than most,"I've been out of reading most marvel titles for a long time, keeping up with only spiderman. With the start of Civil War I was sucked into reading all sorts of marvel titles again, which lead to a question of where Nick Fury dissappeared too, and Secret War was the answer. Or so I thought.The Artwork in this book is beautiful. Some of the story telling techniques were new and fresh (reading computer text files of recorded conversations) and the overall premise of the story seemed good, until about halfway through the story. At that point it seemed hurried and eager to finish as well as a bit inconclusive. And the Nick fury question of where was not answered, but it gave a clear indication of why.All in all Amazon's price versus the cover price made the hardback version of this book worth the o-kay story (did I mention the awesome art?)"
3,ehh,"It was alright. artwork was what kept me going. it was an alright read, but I would not miss it if it fell off the planet."
2,Odd storyline w/ dark art hold this book back,"This book just had to be good. The creative team and the characters involved were clearly too good to be true. The story seemed like pages were missing. What could have been fleshed out and moved the story along was done off panel. The dialogue, which Bendis excels at, seemed flat here. The overall plot wasn't bad but the ending seemed so rushed. Just a weird book. The art, which was beautiful at times, was so incredibly dark that it was hard to decipher who was in each in panel and that's never good. Dell'Otto is a fantastic artist but this might not have been the best form for him. Like I said, just a strange book."
2,A Good Premise,"What could have been a great story, superheroes going undercover in a foreign land, ends up being poorly executed. The painted art is often dark and difficult to follow. The story is muddled by a non-linear narrative which doesn't flow through past to present, and requires a new character to come in and explain the whole plot to the characters and the readers. Not the worst thing I've ever read, but I couldn't recommend it, either. Go get David Mazzechelli's and Paul Aster's City of Glass, instead."
2,"fantastic art, but little else...","you won't miss anything by passing on this one, except some super art by dell'otto. shoddy writing by bendis."
2,Meh,"It contains some relevance now due to Skrull Invasion, but it really was not very good...I would not recommend getting this."
2,Missing Secret War!,"Brian Michael Bendis is a generally well-regarded writer, but this book is a huge waste of time for the reader and all involved. There is a Secret War that Nick Fury put the heroes on in Doctor Doom's kingdom of Latveria and guess what? That battle is still secret, it's never shown! This is inexcusable writing. They take five issues to hint at the battle, and the aftermath and consequences of such, but the battle itself is shown only in tiny, brief flashbacks. What??! Then why bother?Then the insult is compounded by a trade paperback that is only half-filled with the actual comic. The other half are goofy ""email"" transcripts and panels on a ""Who's Who"" of various villains. Was not worth the price paid for it, I want my money back, Bendis! Next time, put out a 12-issue story, if you can't tell it in five!"
3,A Great Idea Scaled Down,"Overall, good concept, amazing art and great writing. However, there are obviously some gaps. It looks like the artist and writers got tired part way through and rushed the the series.One of the bonus pages has Bendis giving a synopsis - the big battle was supposed to include the Avengers, X-Men, Fantastic Four, the Defenders and more! Unfortunately, this was not the case as it got scaled down quite a bit.That's how the entire story feels, a great idea scaled down. They put all this work into designing new costumes for the heroes and we only get a few flashbacks.Too bad. If they ever came back and filled out the missing parts of the story this would easily be a 5 star book."
2,Not enough story... too much filler,"I normally love anything by Bendis but this book just doesn't have enough story to qualify. There's a lot of filler material about the villans. Heck, they even put in mock chat logs from IM conversations. Usually when I read a book, it's got words only. If I'm reading a graphic novel, I like a little bit of art. I'd say this book is half art and half plain text. Or dossiers on heros and villans. And that gets old after the first 20+ pages. I'd skip this one next time."
3,"Good story idea, poor delivery","This graphic novel had the story idea potential to be on par with V for Vendetta, but in the end the plot line was over about halfway through. The rest of the book was marginally interesting, but mostly useless information about the characters. The drawings were excellent though."
2,Meh.,"I thought that was rather flat. Nice art, and nice story - for what is actually there, but the climax fades out and there's no sense of catharsis or conclusion, least of all 'an end'. The endless pages of transcripts and SHIELD files were just 'filler'. If you can't fill out the story properly, don't insult the readers by injecting the book half full of superfluous text and gimmicks. I didn't read a word of it. I wanted a graphic novel, not a novel.It was a promising story, but only half explored, and the rest was just a waste of time."
4,Crystal Bracelet,My duaghter loved this bracelet. Exactly as ordered. Waiting to see how the bracelet holds up over time. Reviews should not have a length requirement.
4,lovely,i got this for my niece for her birthday and she loved it :) the color is just like in the picture
5,Beautiful!!,This is a bracelet I wear most of the time...it is pretty enough to dress down and dress up. It came packaged in a very nice gift box.
5,The teachers loved it,We gave this bracelet to my kids' teachers and they loved it. I saw the principal of our school and a few other teachers admiring it. The bracelet is sturdy and well constructed and to top it off its really pretty.
1,It turned colors about three days after i brought it :(,I really liked it when i first got it and the box it came in was awesome!!But it turned colors after the first three days... it looks horrible now :(Im really sad because i REALLLYY liked it and planned to wear it for a lonnnng time :/
1,Part broken,I was very disappointed with this product since i bought it for one of my students as a graduation gift.....the heart was broken :(
4,Pretty bracelet,"I bought this bracelet for my son's elementary school teacher. She loved it! The box and gift card were very nice as well. The length seemed a bit on the small side, however."
4,Pretty,This is a great gift for yourself or someone you may want to pass some inspiration to. The only thing is the way it clasps doesn't always stay hooked. But it's cute
5,"NEON WINDS, A COMING HOME","NEON WINDS turns my polaroid-negative memories into spirited dancing colors in my mind. Oceanic, wistful, lending wings to my dreams. It's as magical and mystical as my mother's voice. Haunting, the familiar voices of distant mermaids sing out their siren voices across the expance of the sacred waters of my soul. A great stream of coloured sound to sleep against. Perfect for a dark winter's night beside a fire. A hymn to one's self.NEON WINDS is a found treasure.My favorite music of all musics!"
2,Falling Asleep at My House,"I, too, have read Cait London before and loved her writing. In fact, I had a standing order for this book as soon as it came in. I found that for at least the first half of the book everyone talked in riddles like they were in a therapy session and were trying to say what was expected. I was bored to tears until Jemma and Hogan finally got something going, but then afterward everything went weird again. I cannot recommend this book. Try her earlier books, they were much better."
2,Very dissappointed after waiting for this book.,"I love contemporary romanaces and I keep my eyes open for upcoming books. When I saw this one, I added it to my list of must buy books. Half-way through this book, I'm struggling to finish it. The dialog is just as bad as my spelling, terrible. People do not have conversations like this, even in make believe land.This could have been a great book, the story line is there, but it just doesn't make the cut."
1,one of the worst,"SAVE YOUR MONEY. Tough, tedious read. So very poorly written, disjointed prose; dull, boring characters, too many plots-none developed well or fully enough. Luke-warm sex/love scenes.As I was reading, so much didn't make sense to me. I kept thinking I was missing something and found myself re-reading pages. There really were little pieces of information missing; poor editing perhaps?This book is unlike the other books I've read and enjoyed by Ms Logan/London..""Sleepless"" has none of the warmth and humor and cohesiveness of her other books. I've heard that sometimes other people publish books under established names in the romance field. I wonder if this is one of those cases.If you want to see how a book with three plots can be written successfully and enjoyably (as this one should have been written), read ""montana sky"" by Nora Roberts."
2,Too many characters to care,"I'm glad to see that others agree with my assessment of this book: too many characters! Ben is an idiot, Hogan is a self-absorbed ninny, Mitch is an amateur psychologist (sleeping with his patient), and Aaron is an immature Romeo. The women aren't much better, especially Jemma, who is so silly I wanted to throw the book out the window. Unfortunately, I was on a plane, so I had to wait for the airport trash can. Save your money."
3,The cast is really too large.,"I always love Ms London's way of writing, but really, this book is padded too many a characters. Everyone has issues, and everyone loves someone (except the psycho). There are three brothers and their father who love their respective girlfriends, and these men and women have to deal with their relationships with everyone else. Then, we have a mad rapist-wannabe sending underwear to one of our heroines.When it is time for the final Big Hug scene, I'm just too tired to keep score to care. It is as if four short stories are glued into one big romance. Sometimes many isn't better."
5,Romance Lovers' Delight,"Loved this book...once I started it couldn't put it down until finished. The characters were delightful. Hogan Kodiak, what a HUNK."
1,Not worth it,"I found this book to be boring. I agree people don't really talk like this. The dialogue was awful. Also I thought the relationship between Carley and Mitch bordering on incestuoes, he is after all her adopted brother. Jemma was annoying beyond belief, and for a 39 year old man Hogan was immature."
1,Don't bother,Somehow I got through this. I thought characters were either simple or just annoying. The writing was awful. I continued to read since I have liked Cait Logan stories. I doubt if I would ever try this author's books under the name London again.
3,Kate Kennedy - Senior Sleuth,"A cute book - but, oh, that ending! How could an author get her two heroines inside a deserted building at night, with someone holding a gun on them, and not explain how they got away?! A serious omission!Apart from that, it was an enjoyable mystery with two lively 60-something ladies, Kate & Marlene, who prove that you can always sleuth & snoop at any age. The South Florida setting is nicely described. I see the author, ""Nora Charles"", (very tongue-in-cheek) is actually Noreen Wald, who wrote an entertaining series about a woman who was a ghostwriter. If the Kate & Marlene series continues, I would certainly read the next book."
2,Second in Series Seriously Sinks,"While I thoroughly enjoyed the first novel in this series by the author, and started out enjoying the second, ""Who Killed Swami Schwartz"", there were two major drawbacks to this title. First, the excessive dwelling on, by the main character Kate Kennedy, about her husband's death during the signing of the condo and her continued lamentations regarding her missing him, takes away a great deal from the enjoyment of the series. As readers, dear author, take note: we get it, he died, she's a widow, it's a lot to contend with. Let's move on with character development. Second, while I won't give away the ending to this novel, the denoument is incredibly disappointing. Did the author, Nora Charles, run out of steam and lose interest in the telling? It certainly appears to be the case. I will definitely read the third in this series, if it becomes available, and hope that it will be as interesting and clever as the first."
2,"great play, the kindle edition is slightly lacking","This was my first time reading this play and i found it very entertaining. Several passages were so well written as stir my heart, and I recognized many often quoted lines throughout the text. I would give five stars for the play itself and would recommend it to anyone.My problem lies with the kindle edition. there is no table of contents. There are no page numbers. There are several short sections of text where the letter b is replaced with the letter p. This is slightly distracting."
3,Good for what it is.,Modern readers wish more words defined. But it works for what it is. An extremely portable version of Shakespeare's Henry V.
2,Description was for larger item,"The description given for this crystal scrulpture was for the larger, more valuable size. Amazon did say I could return it, but I decided to keep it even thought it wasn't the great deal originally indicated."
3,"Neat, but out of date","This is a neat book, but it needs updating big time. AT its price, however, you can't really complain. I'd love to see a real directory type directory of these stations but that can't be done until information in this book and around the world is updated regarding which stations are still on, which have disappeared, changed or adding information about new ones. Get on it!"
1,"Heavy on religion, extremely low on psychology","I was very excited to find a book on this subject. After reading the editorial review and the book description, I gathered that it would be a psychological. The father described sounded just like my father. Great! I was unpleasantly surprised to find this book taking a completely religious approach to the subject. Pretty much the only advice this book offered was ""turn to God."" The book goes onto suggest among other things, abstaining from TV as it is a ""tool of Satan"" and criticizes talk shows for offering a ""secular"" view of problems. If you want a religious view on this problem - or any other problem for that matter - then this is the book for you. If you're looking for a psychological study, look elsewhere. And if Amazon could update the book description to reflect the fact that this book is a religious book, I might be the last person to write a one star review of ""Fatherless Women."""
5,This book has all the information necessary to be a success,"Marketing retirement communities for 12 years I've heard many proclaimed experts on the senior living industry. Benjamin Pearce has obviously walked in the shoes of each department from the bottom to the top . . . workers to investors . . . to understand the senior living industry one can do the same by reading this book - it is a goldmine of information for the novice and the expert. ""Here's to you Pearce"" for an excellent book!"
4,Really good for those interested in assisted living needs,"I needed information on how to finance, build and market senior housing. The information in this book on elderly and handicapped housing needs is really helpful to me. This is well done, and those of us not part of the industry can understand it."
3,CD 1,"I heard SPILLER'S ""CRYBABY"" on Pandora. Looked for it online and purchased it on Amazon.The disc has 3 tracks: Royksopp's Malselves Memorabilia Mix (which is what i heard), JollyMusic Thriller Remix and Cosmos Vocal Mix. The last 2 tracks are forgettable. Your musicaltaste may vary, but this would have been better as a download."
3,good product,"I only used this for one month and did not feel like I lost any weight on it, but maybe I need to stay on it longer, but I was told I would see results in a week. I did however notice a difference in my skin and hair. I am in my 30's and am starting to see the ageing process and I felt this product made my skin look younger and more plump and firm. I also noticed my hair was softer and fuller. I would keep using this product except it is kinda expensive."
2,"Hasn't helped yet, but waiting to see","I have not had any results (no weight loss or health improvements), but I want do want to be fair, so I am ordering bottle number 2 to see if there are any results over time. So far, it appears to be just another placebo...."
3,Good stuff.,This cologne But very good. Not quite what I expected. From the producer of joy perfume It was very different from that of him.
4,Good clean educational fun !,"I liked this book because you can tell it's a true story. You get to learn about the life of a cat adopted by an American family living in a totally foreign culture and you end up learning just as much about that culture as you do about cats. A very positive, intimate, and encouraging story that is short and easy to read with children. Makes a refreshing change from the images of the Middle East we see on the news."
3,Does the job,"Price wise, it was a great deal... the brushes are not the best quality, BUT they worked and like I said for the price it did the job."
5,Delicious nutrient dense,The recipes in this book are definitely family friendly and excellent tasting. Focus is on nutrient-dense eating and features whole foods such as greens and whole grains. Every recipe i've tried has been excellent.
4,good video,It was a good video and good for someone starting out. I wish it was longer and covered how they did after they did it for awhile! The recipes are good but I haven't tried many of them since I don't eat meat analogs....I need a hit man for my pantry since I live with a carnivore! I am not tempted by his stuff but it does make it hard at times! Specially when we live in an rv and have limited room!
1,This had the potential of being an informative dvd.,"This dvd doesn't go far enough. Rip visits 2 families and creates a few recipes and empties refrigerators (like every other food make-over show, but what about the families? Where is the follow-up? Did the families stick with the plant strong diet? Are they healthier? Better for eating this way?This is a VERY low budget dvd that could have been recorded in 48 hours. I was expecting better from Rip."
3,why do i feel like their selling me a book,"Show was somewhat informative, but it felt less like an informative documentary and more a promo shoot for the book."
2,Dissappointing,"I must be the only one who have noticed that Rip Esselstyn does not used utensils to prepare his food, which can be unsanitary especially if you are preparing your food for other people. For instance, he uses his bare hands to flatten out the layers in the lasagna. I was just grossed out while watching this. Several times, he licked his fingers. Yuck!Don't get me wrong; I love the fact that more people are realizing that plant based diet is greatly benefical. In fact, I'm a raw foodist consuming at least 70% of my daily food intake with uncooked fruits and veggies to preserve enzymes and vitamins/minerals.As far as the production, it's very amateurish and can be compared to your typical home videos. More importantly, the largest downfall is the lack of follow up interviews with the families. The film ended with Rip driving away from the second family after his food preparation demonstration and that was it. Definitely, don't waste your money on this product."
5,"The best thing since ""whole"" grain sliced bread!","This journey for me started almost 4 months ago when I quit smoking. Like many other fans, I watched the documentary Forks Over Knives which than led me to Rip. What I love about Rip's approach is that it is stripped down by a healthy, hard working man that speaks like the rest of us. I ordered the Engine 2 diet book which was full of information but when I saw this dvd available for pre-order I jumped on it!it is a great concept of walking 2 families thru cleaning out their pantry, shopping, reading & understanding labels and finally cooking great meals! Dr. Caldwell & Rip Esselstyn have reached Mac product status for me. Anything they sell.... I will buy! Thank you again for the gift of knowledge and health!"
2,Disappointing,"This video does not do enough. 2 families are visited and there is no follow up. It would have like to have seen if the 2 families stuck with the program. Aside from picking up a couple tips, this wasn't very helpful."
2,Lacking in Current Research......,"To eat better is a good thing. Unfortunately, his low fat diet is from the '80s. Numerous studies show the benefits of healthy fats such as Omega 3's, unrefined cocoanut oil, etc. Fats in the diet contribute to satiety, carry flavors, helps the absorption of antioxidants, and reduce the impact of glucose in the blood stream. Plus, a little butter on your broccoli could make the improvement in flavor that makes you WANT to eat it. Rip's heart is in the right place, and I'm glad he wants to help others. He gets an ""A"" for effort!"
4,Inspiring movie,I loved the original movie as it educated me how I can prepare healthier meals for my family. I watched this movie to get inspired and to learn more about which meals to prepare. I also visited the website for further information and will stay in touch. My family and I are determined to change the way we eat. Thanks for the movie.
5,Healthy Lifestyles,"I chose this rating because it brings me one step closer to being healthier. I have RA and with the shots and all of the meds I just feel like I have to do something to be healthier. By eating right, my joints are improving and I donot have as much pain. I hope that long term it enables me to reduce some of the meds."
4,Engine 2 Kitchen Rescue,"This was a very good, well, shown production giving the viewer a good deal of information and ideas for eating healthier and the use of more tasty vegan products. The only reason I did not give it a full 5 stars is that while it points out how important it is to read product labeling, it did not offer details on all that it showed that they make. A good primer for motivation and inspiration, but, I wish it showed more practical cooking."
1,Not easy to use to give shot,"This product will insert the needle, but you still need to push in the syringe. I bought this as a backup to another device I bought and was very disappointed. I much prefer the Autoinject as it does everything in one click. I use it for my diabetic dog and it's all done and over with in one click using the Autoinject. If you need to give an injection fast to a squirming child or animal, go with the Autoinject."
3,A question,Hello everybody! I would like to know if I can use this product with insulin carpules(cartridges) (100 units per one )? Thanks!
1,Quality has been reduced on a formerly great product.,"Already had an Inject-Ease made by its original maker, Palco. It was, and the one I have still is, a brilliant product. BUT...Palco has apparently gone out of business, and Ambimed bought the design, rights, etc. and now makes the product. Either I got a lemon, or the Ambimed version of the product is vastly inferior to the original...parts didn't fit together perfectly and function smoothly. The power of the spring is less than before, or maybe its functional strength is reduced by internal resistance due to ill-fitting components. Seems like the new guys have cut corners in engineering and manufacturing in an attempt to save a few pennies. I returned the one I got. Will try buying it again in the hopes that the first was a lemon. If it is no better, I will return that one, too."
5,Just what I needed and works perfectly.,"I had prostate cancer surgery in June 2011 and as a result I have total erectile dysfunction and have to inject a prescription medicine for my ED. This product was recommended by an online support group I belong to, but hard to find locally. Both CVS and Walgreen's couldn't find a source for the auto injector and Amazon was my last resort and I couldn't believe they had it. It is easy to use and works 100% as described and will work for any one who like me hates needles and has to self inject any medicine. The hard case also works great for transporting loaded syringes for use when traveling. I now use Amazon for my first choice to buy almost anything I need."
4,A Godsend,"After a month of injecting myself with NO problems, OVERNIGHT, I developed a fear of the needle and could not follow through with the ""stick."" I had to teach my wife to stick me and hen I had no problem pushing the Lantus in. None of it was painful, but I just could not get my arm to connect with my brain. I ordered the Inject- ease and it solved my problem and allowed my wife freedom again! It is simple and works exactly right. Fully adjustable and painless. I have recommended it to my medical clinic and other doctors."
2,not as expected,The cool part of the shirt - which is just a t - is the design. the design is on the back - the front is a small insignia of the hardkor sportswear logo. disappointed.
5,5 STARS!,"This was one of the best books I've ever read. H.M. Hoover did a GREAT job writing this book. It's suspensful, mysterious, and FULL of action. I've read this book over and over again, and each time I can't seem to put it down!"
5,The best blink song yet!,"This is by far the best blink song because its a cross between their old and new stuff, plus an amazing video. Also this cd has a really funny b-side and probably their funniest song aswell"
1,I think that's all we have time for.,"Johnny ""Bowtie"" Barstow first gained notoriety from having his Christmas songs played onThe Annoying Music Show. Here we have his Christmas album in its entirety, plus more bonus tracks than you can shake a stick at. Barstow seems to fancy himself a jazz singer, but he doesn't actually have musical talent. He sings the wrong notes and he has trouble following the melody. Some might say that jazz is built on improvisation, so his ""mistakes"" might be intentional, but I'm pretty sure that when his voice cracks, that isn't intentional. This is a truly terrible music album, but as an unintentional comedy album, it's pretty darn funny."
1,Smells like old men,"The Bod Man Fresh Guy scent is best, but I bought this based on reviews saying it was so great, it was the best of the Bod Man scents; however, it smells like your grand father's shaving cream. It's one of those odors we've all smelled in our lives--usually in an old neighborhood barbershop--and it is nasty. Simply very unappealing. I paid 8 bucks for this jug of nasty and now what do I do with it?"
2,"Bad sole, bad leather","I had my doubts when I got my pair and saw that they are made in India, my doubts were right, after 6 month using the shoes, the sole wear extremelly fast a couple of holes appear, the leather is also bad quality.It's a shame that a brand that used to be so good is not anymore."
4,Florsheim Men's Canfield Cap,Really nice looking shoe. The wider widths that are available isjust what I need. RB (Chicago)
1,"Fine shoe, if you enjoy blisters","This is the most uncomfortable shoe I've ever worn. I thought that given a few months it would've been broken in by now, but its still scraping my heel on a daily basis. I even wear 2 pairs of thick socks, and still I get blisters. I love Florsheims, but these are just flawed in design. The picture even shows it...look how there is almost a lip on the heel for, I guess, added support, but its sharp as a razor and cuts inward instead of upward. So, buy a loafer from Florsheim, but not these.."
2,Not what I expected,I should of read the past reviews and not went by the demensions. The deminsions are for the box and not the model. But over all it is a challenging little model to build. Looks good in my office.
3,Interesting but not skill level 2,"This toy was an enjoyable build. However it is advertised as a skill level 2, when in fact, the box indicates it's a skill level 4. Although it was enjoyable to build and the instructions were quite good, it did have many small pieces which make it difficult for young hands. My son did need my assistance at various stages in constructing it."
2,Was not worth the price!,"For the price I paid I was not very pleased. The handle on the drawer is loose, it did not come with enough screws to put it together. I had to find some extras around the house. It is very pretty but if I had to do it all over again I would not pay what I did for it."
4,shiny and new,"This fork seems juuuuust fine. Good fork. I could stick it in pretty much anything and call said thing ""done."""
5,Wonderful Group of Stories,"I have read thousands of books and I have to admit that anthologies are some of my favorite books. This book had so many different stories , each one was just the right size to be savored like a sip of wine and a chocolate covered strawberry. Just delicious. And I am not an author."
1,A total piece of junk...,"...this book was a complete waste of time and money.Check out Chapter 1 ""Equipment Selection Guidelines"",where they give you a bunch of hot tips about selectingthe best aluminum frame rackets. Actually, I realizedI'd been shucked well before that, when I saw the cover,which was decorated with pictures of racketball stars fromthe 70s with Studio 54 hairstyles who are now probably inthe old folks' home. I've been trying to learn racketballby running around like a chicken with my head cut off whilemy opponents try not to laugh themselves to death, and I canconfidently report that that experience has taught me farmore than this book ever could."
2,Save Your Money,"I returned the book. The ideas were tired and the bunny rabbit cake was absolutely amatuerish in appearance in my opinion. It was a good concept for a book but I felt that it should have offered more to bring a family closer together as they experienced the holiday or had some things in that were standout creative or unique. The book had torn tissue paper vases, blown eggs, etc. I have found more creative and unique ideas in the magazine Family Fun."
1,Mingus is the man but this book is depressing,"Get the Miles Davis autobiography instead,,,,this one is a downer"
3,"Not a literary masterpiece, but not a piece.of junk.","To start, this book is not bad enough to turn a reader away from the whole genre. That statement is ridiculous. Charles Mingus is not a writer, the mission of this autobiography is to let the reader know what jazz's roots were. Parts of this biography are on the disturbing side.In a postive side, the book has a meaning. It stands for all the great jazz players who were brought down by drugs and prostitution. It shows how even Charles Mingus, possible the greatest jazz bass player to ever play, was victim to this. Racism stood in the way of his success. Jazz listeners assume that because a player is currently a hero or jazz giant today, they did not have a wealthy life. Because of this, they set out to earn money on the streets through drugs and sex.This book is not superbly written, but it allows people to realize what jazz has been through."
3,"""Print the legend, not the fact."" John Ford","In the uncompromisingly self-mythologizing ""Beneath the Underdog"", Charles Mingus reveals himself to be a slave to his passions, namely music and sex, with the emphasis on the former. Mingus extrudes a complicated portrait of himself as a virtuoso musician, pimp, orgiast, philosopher - and all these facets might come out in the same paragraph. His no-holds-barred, occasionally chaotic style reflects his music nearly perfectly, which makes this an essential read for even a casual fan of his music. Anyone looking for a conventional, ""and then I wrote"" sort of autobiography should look elsewhere, but those looking for the development of the personality that informed one of the singular careers in the history of any sort of art will find a lot to enjoy here."
5,Impressionistic self-portrait of a powerful artist,"Listen to his music while you are reading this book.It will help you understand what is going on. Minguspaints a self-portrait which impresses the reader with it'sbrilliant colors, distorted proportions and powerful images.Mingus shares with us the events, people and impressionsin his life which matterd to him. This book is compelling,humorous, disturbing and at times disonant. Just like hisgreatest music. Unlike his music, however, this is not agreat literary work. The value of this book is not in theliterature, but the stature of the author. ""Beneath theUnderdog..."" is a view into the soul of the artist ratherthan a narrative of the life of the man. Highly recommendedfor those who are prepared to accept Mingus on his own termsCharles Saxe, Chicago, Illinois"
2,II B.S.,"is the title of one of Mingus' best and most accomplished songs, and should have been the title for this book. It seems nothing more to me than complete and utter bollocks. Half-truths all the way. After listening to his great music and hearing/reading fascinating and often hilarious anecdotes about this complex man, I was disappointed to read the pathetic bragging of an insecure man. He does not seem to be in touch with any of the other characters in the book, they all seem to be some sort of extention of Mingus - they talk like him and I'm sure Mingus' memory was even more subjective than is usual in an autobiography. Mingus once wrote that he didn't know how to communicate through words, so he used music instead. He should have stuck to that, this book inadvertently ridicules the great composer. To BS, too true..."
2,Disappointing,I was looking for a book on his music. This book belongs in Fantasy. It is a play by play of Mr. Mingus' sex life. I have no desire to research him any further.
3,Get to the point already!!!,Gwynne Forster is a master of description but she can hammer a point into the ground. I almost flung this book across the room because it seems like she makes up extra stuff to get her book a longer length.
3,"The agony of the ""Ecstacy."" Read Forster's other books.","Everyone's entitled to an off-day. ""Ecstacy"" is Gwynne Forster's. Her novella, ""Christopher's Gift,"" and her novels, ""Against All Odds"" and ""Sealed with a Kiss"" are exceptional. ""Ecstacy"" falls short in comparison to her other work. The premise is exciting. The relationship between the two main characters is funny and touching. However, the extended travelog in the middle of the book bogs down the action and the character development. One wants to shout: ""Enough already!"" The works mentioned above are better introductions to the strength of Forster's work."
1,Big disapointment!,We bought this game because our kids love Nick and all things trivia but as other reviewers have said the rules to this game are more complicated than they need to be. The questions are not that great especially because many of the shows are not even featured on Nick anymore. In the end we gave up on the game after first try and decided to return it to the store. Do yourself a favor and find a better game. This one is a real stinker.
4,Nickelodeon Trivia Game,The Nickelodeon Trivia Game is one of my favorite games. I'm a master at Nickelodeon (especially Spongebob) so this game is pretty easy for me. The only problem is that some of the questions are Nick Jr. questions.
1,In Fisherman Tactical Panfish,"This is a great dvd if you have a $10,000 a week fishing budget and own all the equipment on the plant. There is nothing anywhere on this dvd to help you catch cold much less a fish. All this is a much of clips from previous tv shows. If you looking for some dvd to help you catch more fish. This ain't it! Very disappointed to say the least.PhilipCordova TN"
3,Pogo For President a.k.a. I Go Gogo,"There was a poster, GAF 3-D Fewmaster. Mrs. Kelly & the person who made the movie got into a cat fight so to speak. So the movie never was in the theatres. It went to VHS Formant before Walt Disney got it. Now I'm not sure who have rights of the the movie? The last I heard that is on DVD."
4,Horror Hotel,"Yes I liked this product. Horror Hotel is one of my fav classic horror movies Finding it along with another horror movie was a plus. Very good value, arrived within 5 days."
3,"Movie good, video from VHS not so good.",I saw this when I was 11 and liked it.If you like Hammer films you might like this. Same writer & some actors. Video was taken from a VHS tape looks like tape not DVD! I still liked it.(Horror Hotel)
5,Awesome!,"There is nothing like the old horror movies. For in it, they still recognize the power and the fear of the cross."
1,Couldn't even finish it,"I'm not sure what book the 5-star reviewers read, but I finally gave up on it. The diction changes when the characters go to hell to a difficult to read, confusing ramble about nothing. Well, nothing except that hell kinda sucks, but we should know that by now. It seemed like a lot of pointless navel-gazing on the author's part. Bizarre, pointless as far as I can tell, I can't recommend this to anyone."
5,Back in print ...About Time!,"This is Elkin's best work in my opinion. It is sad, funny, chewy, and ridiculous. The humor is so dark you might need a flashlight to make your way but is worth it. Elkin paints hysterical portraits of all your favorite New Testament all-stars. I am so glad that this is back in print and you should be to. If you like Elkin please buy this so his work will stay in print."
1,Big disappointment,"I rented this movie because I love chick flicks and have enjoyed some of Julia Stiles' other films (e.g. Save the Last Dance, The Prince and Me, Ten Things I hate About You). Also enjoyed Shirley MacLaine in In Her Shoes. I thought it was unusual that I hadn't heard of this film before. After watching it, I can see why. The script and plotline were TOO cheesey, even for the average chick flick fan. My advice? Get something that better utilizes the skills of these talented actresses. (Even if you are an avid chick flick fan!)"
4,Funny.,"The other OSS flick is funny, too. The close quarters comedy gunfights from which the main character emerges unscathed are the type that, (after this flick, anyway), shouldn't be explored by film makers ever, ever again. Please. But yeah. This character is a classic in my mind already. Great lead. Great supporting cast members. Sets, scenery, wardrobe... during the early stages of the other oss movie, which I watched slightly before, I thought it WAS a movie from the 40's - I thought with wide eyed amazement that I'd missed something for years and years. Anyway, if you have a pulse, you probably will get a laugh or two out of this one.It's subtitled, with funny effect. Jokes told/ read in English that rhyme (toward the end), don't rhyme in French, but the characters raucously laugh as if they do while they're speaking. Kind of quirky. Good flick."
3,A french version of Austin Powers? I think so,"This is a french spoof of the Bond franchise. As a result, it seems very reminiscent of an Austin Powers movie. The main difference between these two movies spoof heros is that the french version is a little bit more sophisticated. The movie is stupid-funny at points as well, but it does not need to get into the gutter to do so, rather it just gets politically incorrect at points which makes for a nice change of pace. Get it and laugh, then wonder why some foreign films are much better than the American garbage."
3,The Prophecy,"I guess this book was good, but I found it really hard to understand as I hadn't read thev Hork bajir chronclies first. All the book was about stuff which happened in that. it seemed to end too soon,there should have been a bit about cassie at the end. but still a good animorph book, though you should read the hork bajir chronicles first."
1,"not as advertised,",I only received Animorphs #32. I thought I was receiving the set #32-#37 as advertised. If one book was all that I was to receive then the description should have been clearer.
4,it could be better,The book was pretty good. Some of it didnt make sense even after I read it twice. I would reccomend it to all the fans though. read the HB Chron. first though
5,The Prophecy is great!,"You will love the Prophecy. It's really good. I like it when Aldrea enters Cassie's mind. Aldrea is very strong. So, read the Prophecy."
1,did not work,"Major disappointment, CD did not work. I start up, but Edmark install cannot find Install Shield wizard, and hangs up. Never got to use :( and of course no returns really possible."
4,Good First Album (if a bit short)!,"Pina Kollar's album, Quick Look, is a fine (if all too brief...37 minutes and 9 seconds!) debut. The singer/songwriter has a voice that reminds me of Melanie in her early recording years, though not quite as emotional. Which may be a good or not so good thing, depending on whether or not you were a Melanie fan. In any case, Pina's got a wonderfully unique voice and uses it well on every cut. She can sing quietly and reflectively but she rocks as well. The arrangements on this album are interesting and well thought out too. There are recorders, mandolins, cellos, and Indian Anle Bells(!), but nothing sounds too ""precious."" The guitar work adds crunch and the drums are always appropriate for each cut. There's not a badly written song on this album either which is rare today, so I highly recommend it. The only reason it's not getting five stars from me is the short length. Ten songs at 37 minutes is just a bit puny by today's standards."
1,Just doesn't deliver,"I should have known better than to pick this one up, but at least now I can warn the rest of you. This book barely has a plot, the characters are flat and two-dimensional, and their secrets, when revealed, turn out to be not all that interesting after all. Even if reading a book about women using a book club as an excuse to talk about their troubles with relationships, children, etc., is your cup of tea, you can do better. If it's not, Dinner with Anna Karenina won't win you over. Stay away."
2,overrated,"i picked this book out of the library because they had 8 copies of it so i figured it was a real hit. i should have taken the hint, considering all 8 copies were still on the shelf! i was disappointed with the book's predictability. while reading it i got bored, and skipped 300 pages only to discover that nothing had changed and i had no trouble following through to the end of the book. there is no reading between the lines, i found. all the characters' personalities, conflicts, and strengths are spelled out as if in a pattern. i enjoy more in depth reading, and this book did not make me think. i have to say, occasionally there were some great adjectives and Goldreich has the gift of description."
1,Dinner with Anna Karenina,"Not very well written, bad unrealistic dialogue and unrealistic character development,but fun nonetheless. A decent beach or airplane read."
2,Ugh! Writing by numbers - should be 1 star,"Sorry, but this book is junk. Artificial plot mechanisms, predictable resolution, a central conflict so drawn out that its credibility is severely frayed, characters (primary and supporting) so superficially sketched it's maddening, terrible use of adverbs, cliched dialogue, transitions you can see from a mile away, telling rather than showing (hello creative writing 101!); very frustrating dynamic between the characters where they are supposedly such good friends but then they're not at the same time - too much drama. Blech. I only liked the discussions about the authors Shirley Jackson and Louisa May Alcott and a few descriptive sentences."
2,fluff,"I was disappointed. Had read some good reviews, picked it for a book club. It was unanimously disregarded as shallow writing. I admit, I was taken in by the title much like I was with that garbage ""Jane Austen Book Club"". That book was a disgrace to Austen's name!"
3,Best of Doug Kershaw and Rusty Kershaw,"The first six tracks are great, especially the classics like ""Cajon Joe-Bully of the Bayou"". Didn't think much of the remaining tracks (6-12) on the CD. Seems like the last six tracks lost some of that good foot stompin' cajun fiddlin' style.An album like this is a candidate for Napster selections!"
3,Average textbook,"I was disappointed at the many synonyms that this author used to describe various terms. Going from programming to learning the systems design aspect was confusing using this book. I obtained a B in the class, partially because of the wide variety of terms that meant the exact same thing."
3,Reference material or study material.,"This book has great content (when you eventually figure out what is important), and really covers every aspect of System Analysis and design.The only problem is that it is often difficult to understand and very dragged out. The problem is that you need to read each chapter two or three times to really figure what the Author is trying to say.Despite the content, reading this book is difficult because of all the useless information that clutters the important stuff. This book is great for a reference but not for studying purposes."
2,Extremely repetitive book,"I had to purchase this book as part of a graduate course in information systems. Beign myself a professional programmer and engineer, I am familiar with most of the terms and cases presented in this book. Unfortunately, the material is repeated over and over again. A 50 pages chapter perhaps have less than 10 pages useful content. Some of the topics are irrelevant but they spend a considerable amount of time on them. In short: I will not recomend this book unless you are willing to spend long hours filtering the content or you are forced to buy it as part of a college class."
4,Decent CDLC book,"Especially at the lower prices of the used copies! The book does repeat itself quite a bit, but this was intended as a teaching device to make sure certain important ideas were well learned."
1,i dont even received this book yet,i dont received my book you guys asked me for review. This is ridiculous almost 1 month
1,Is it a Novel or a Textbook?,"The book has several obvious errors. Far to many foreign words or psuedo acroynms which threw off my understanding of the material I was reading. Far to many complicated and confusing charts with no real explanation or flow to the chapter it supported. Not good for a classroom textbook. Scrub the long case files, I felt like I was reading a Novel rather than a textbook. The book can do without the extensive case files."
3,Good Referrence But Very Wordy Textbook,"I found being an IT professional that this book was a good referrence material for someone who is just entering the IT field or someone who has been in it for a while.I felt that it did get the points across however it said the same thing over and over in many chapters. I felt that it had major over kill on reviewing but all-in-all it was a good book.Depending on if you would use the case studies in the book, probably not. However, if you wanted to apply what they were talking about in a real life situation, it would be helpful for someone new to IT.Check out the auctions for a cheap copy. Another help guide that goes well with this book is ISBN#: 0-256-25712-4. This has three case studies in it and it would help you write out a school paper on network design and/or data flow."
1,Hi-Tech dribble!,"This book is terrible. I agree with the last post. This book is not worth the money nor the time spent reading it. I've learned more from reading the phonebook! This text contains nothing but lists and lists and more lists, with a bit of color to break up the monotony. Of course I HAD to buy it for my MIS course. I NEVER would have spent the money otherwise. As soon as exams are over, I'm selling this text at the next buy-back at student union. Only buy this book if its assigned for a course, or if you're into incredibly dull reading. A snore...!"
1,Good candidate for Comedy Central,"I think I just severely overrated this book.. Should have selected 0 stars, but there is no such a choice in the drop-down menu... This is written in the worst style imaginable. It has fundamental technical mistakes and demonstrates the authors' ignorance on a variety of related topics. Apparently the authors are absolutely clueless on the subject... ...Imposing this ""masterpiece"" on your students and forcing them to read it is not only a waste of their time; it is also an insult on their intelligence. At the beginning it is very hard to keep reading, but after a certain point it becomes almost amusing... You can't wait to see what's next! Keep on, you won't be disappointed. A lot of laughter is awaiting you!"
1,completely unsatisfied!,"I am completey unsatisfied customer with the order. I have to return the book not only it was a wrong one, but it took forever. I am gona have to re-order the right one and wait again while the class already started. I guess I am paying for the mistake I made by ordering my textbook from you guys!"
5,We are all salesmen,"I'm not a salesman, but I read this book several times and expect to continue to do so. Herein lies great advice for living. Jack and Garry Kinder along with Roger Staubach present effective stratagies for succeeding in life. Yep, there's lots of numbers: the five best... the two...the six steps. Simple things, but it jogs the memory when you are under stress. Try the 13 winning traits for a real reward. A book written for salesmen, it applies to everyone."
3,Did not use much,"Sounded like a good idea to prepare our trip to India, but we ended up not using it much. It's cheap and easy to carry around, but still I do not feel we got much out of it. The internet has plenty of basic advice."
3,"Nice for the armchair traveller, but nothing more","The region of Asia and India is so large, it will be impossible - even for a great published like Lonely Planet - to put it all in one book. All the advice you need, all the information you want, all the tips... It just cannot be done. This guide will prove interesting and even fascinating reading for the armchair traveller, or for those wanting an overview before they plan to visit the region. But it's not the kind of guidebook you will want to take with you. It's not a 'travel survival kit' as it claims."
1,"Not very soft, they get uncomfortable after a short amount of time.","Not very soft, they get uncomfortable after a short amount of time. I returned them. I have tried many other brands that are much softer."
3,Gentle treatment of a dark fragment,"This is one of several published completions of Jane Austen's fragment, ""The Watsons."" Unlike most other authors who have attempted to finish this work, John Coates revised Austen's six opening chapters, introduced additional major characters into the story, and changed the characterization of some of those who appear in the fragment. The story is complex and gently humorous. Coates understands Regency society and does a fairly good job of mimicking Austen's tone, though his writing is not as elegant as hers. But he strays somewhat from Austen's realism, making excuses for initially distasteful characters and bringing the whole to an unexpectedly happy ending. A pleasant read, but less morally forceful than Austen's own work."
3,mediocre,"David Icke.....is somewhat of an enigma. This is an O.K. read; must be read with patience though, as it definitely isn't ""unputdownable"". He says it's a self-contained read, however, if you haven't read his other works, you'll be left questioning a lot of his statements. He starts out raving like a babbling idiot, then tapers off into a source-cited-presentation-of arguments. Just read it with an open mind and air of easy demeanor and you'll digest a wealth of information."
2,Tales from where the sun doesn't shine,"I'm convinced that anyone who believes Icke's reasoning and theories in this book is either mentally ill, brainwashed or just plain mad.What we have here is an uneducated person's ramblings about non-existent beings and ages-old conspiracies which only an X-phile might appreciate. Icke makes pathetic ""leaps of logic"" based on highly suspect evidence and cleverly quotes other ""authors"" when making defamatory remarks - all in a lame attempt to avoid prosecution.If Icke was REALLY telling the complete truth he would be silenced. No question about it. The mere fact that he is allowed to write such garbage and engage people in his ""lectures"" is further evidence of his intentions - a tool for misinformation and deceit.Read it for entertainment and nothing else."
2,Balony,"Hehe, O.K. I bought the book -- it's not the first time I've thrown away money and won't be the last. After skimming through it and reading this guy's life story, which includes ""voices"" psychics, and god-knows what else, I can say that I refuse to waste my valuable time reading this clap-trap. Let me suggest that everyone thinking about buying this book, read THIS book first you will be doing yourself a lifelong favor."
4,Cut the sarcasm!,"This book is very interesting. It is a pity that so much of it refers - very sketchily - to Mr Icke's other books and in such a way that, without reading them, some of the impact of what he is saying is lost. My biggest problem with this book is, however, the fact that Mr Icke seems to think that the sarcastic byline enhances his writing whereas it simply irritates and is puerile in the extreme. His message is worthy of more than that!"
2,Not a serious piece of work,"Question: How does one promote a lie ?Answer: Surround it with the truthHere ladies and gentleman is the essence of what Mr David ""Disinformer"" Icke is all about.Specifically, David Icke knowingly feeds his conspiracy-hungry & mentally disturbed audiences with misleading and unsupported claims in an attempt at conditioning them to a hidden ""truth"". This ""truth"" is nothing more than a mixed bag of falsities and partial facts which are designed to create fear, anger and to ultimately discredit the many good researchers out there.If anyone wants a better overview of conspiracy theories which don't involve the paranoid scrawlings of a lunatic (David Icke) then I suggest people read the works of Theirry Meyssan."
5,This man is really talented,This is perhaps my favorite trio cd that I own. Oscar plays beautiful from start to finish. My favorite song Porgy shows just how good that he really is. The meledeys he play seem very hard if possible to play but he makes it sound as if he is playing a simple piece. This is a must have if you enjoy Oscar at his very best.
4,Good,"Same game, same music, for the fan of Tetris the product is OK. I don't give a 5 stars cause the screen is small. You will need your glasses."
2,"Entertaining, but Still Plain Bad","'An Alien Affair' is entertaining enough, if you struggle through the mind-numbingly stupid lesbian plot-line (how many times does Hubbard want us to see Gris being tortured by lesbians? It happens 6 or 7 times). Luckily I kept reading, the book was so stupid until that point that I nearly gave it up. After that it was mildly interesting. Not on my top 10 list..in fact, though I don't have a list, I'll bet it's in the bottom 10 of all the books I've ever read. As to the reviewer from Columbus, OH who claims this book is realistic and great..get real. Obviously a Scientologist."
5,Fantastic Story,I loved all of these stories. I could not stop once I started them. The pacing is great. The satire is great. Hubbard has a fantastic and witty sense of humor. These stories also really they get you thinking. Love them all.
1,The series is terrible,"I thought after reading the first book in the series that this was going to be a pretty good series. The first L.Ron Hubbard book that I read was Battlefield Earth and I absolutely loved it, however this series took a terrible down fall after the first book. It just got stupid. There isn't anyone who is going to always defy the odds like Heller does. I didn't like that and I think the series won't hold my attention to read any more in the series.Sincerely, A very honest critic"
2,I wouldn't,"I have heard this...I owned it. Jimmy Farrar, while having a great voice (in some cases better than Danny Joe) should have had an injunction taken out against him to forbid him from singing Flirtin'. I don't know what it is (over enunciation perhaps) but he just doesn't sing that song in a relaxed enough manner to make it sound listenable (you musicians out there would recognize what I mean if you are familiar with both the Danny Joe versions (live and studio) and this one.While Jimmy is great on the stuff that is from the two Hatchet albums he sang on (Beatin' The Odds and Take No Prisoners)the rest is a prime example of why you should save your money for a new motorcycle or to send your kids to college."
5,Great book,Yet again Osprey have produced a conscise but excellent history cataloging the use of the F-14 units over Irag.Good pictures and profiles. The book also draws heavily on first person accounts from the pilots who flew the missions.Highly recommended.
5,Excellent Series!,"Artwork is amazing. The stories are captivating. I found this series to be excellent as a buildup to ROTS. It does have some holes when you line it up to ROTS, seeing that it was created before the movie, but still an excellent read."
4,great book,"A nice TPB from Darkhorse. I love the Clone Wars series because they show more of the clone wars than what was in the movies. This also introduces what is problably one of the coolest Jedi ever, Quinlan Vos. This graphic novel also has a story about Mace Windu."
2,Disappointing...,"Although the artwork was well done, the stories were not. They were all over the place and moved at a feverish pitch, not really letting the reader come away with anything. I also didn't care for how they made Asajj Ventress look, I thought she was supposed to be stark white, not all tan and shapely. She is also made out to be way too powerful, which I don't buy. Oh well, I guess it's okay, but I wouldn't recommend it."
3,vaapad is awesome,"This is the first Graphic Novel collecting all issues of the series Star Wars: Republic that take place during the clone wars.compared to the other books wich come after this, this book is weak, but almost redeems itself in the end with the reprinting of the extremely well written and even better drawn, Jedi: Mace Windu. This issue, talking of the lightsaber style combat form vaapad and featuring the first appearance of the twisted Assajj ventress is highly enjoyable and is just a glimpse of things to come."
4,Heart and soul of it all...,"A fantastic look into the world of wrestling and the fans that laid the ground work for the sham that's passed off today as; ""professional"" wrestling. My speculation is this book could've been used as a source for the movie, ""The Wrestler"". A well execueted document of people and era that've left the building for good. At times, I wish titles like this would get a second chance. Perhaps a limited run, with current production values; to show, the show; long before Hollywood Hulk Hogan, Jake the Snake, and the more contemporary clowns, that are dreamed up by marketing departments and boardroom hucksters."
4,"Just what I expected, or maybe more.","I was serching for a game that could keep me hours playing it, and that also made me feel like something in my mind was getting better.Obviously, it has no story, and the 3D graphics aren't shown all the time you play, but it gets your brain to work, and if you have the chance to let someone else to play, you start comparing yourself and working hard to makeit better."
2,Geez,"Interesting game, good competition for DS. The narrator was a bit annoying but turning off the sound fixed it. a few of the chalanges aren't explained well enough so i would say to practice before you ""test"". also if youre bad with math (like i am) it helps you with those skills"
3,Hot Brain Not So Hot,Hot Brain is interesting but it did not hold my attention. Graphics are pretty good.
3,Hot Brain for PSP,Don't really know about this product. It was purchased as a Christmas gift for my grandson.
4,"Good but not as good if you expect advanced staff, and not so advanced","It is very basic. I think many people may figure out what to do with their paint pro with included manual. Author should have instructed more on layering and masking with more complicated pictures. I would advice anyone who bought this book also buy Ken McMahon book on a subject. Oh, how much money we as a customer spend on those self-help books. And the thing is we find only one or two brilliant ideas in them. So, buy all books on subject."
4,Depends on what you are looking for...,"I would agree with the other reviewers that this is by no means a training manual (ala Daniels or Coe). However, that doesn't change the fact that it is a very enjoyable book to read, covering legends of the past as well as more recent champions. If you are interested in marathoning, this book is particularly good, as most of the runners covered are marathoners.Whilst the training plans will be of little use, I find this book a great motivator, and that's what every runner needs!"
2,Where's the beef?,"I must agree with the first reviewer, I too purchased this book with much anticipation and was sorely disappointed with it's lack of hard training fact. There is decent info from a few athletes but much of the training info of the more secretive elites are nothing but short biographies and anecdotal evidence akin to the dry packaged responses you get in most running mags."
5,Super!,"I received the book in a timely manner and was pleased with its condition! If given the opportunity, I will purchase from this seller again!Thank you!"
2,"Mostly ""Track and Field News"" rehash ...a cut and paste job.","Having been a running affectionado for 25 years, I eagerly anticipated this book. Sandrock has a great idea, running with and interviewing many distance greats from our time. He does manage to get ""inside their heads"" and that's of value. But much of this seems to be blatantly plagiarized out of old ""Track and Field News"" issues. No surprise T&FN does not include this in their book selections"
5,Small but powerful,You want to start a home-based communications business but all the details overwhelm you. Where do you begin. Werksma takes you through the process in a first things first manner that is so easy to follow. She answers questions you didn't even know you had. Fast reading too
1,Where's Madison????,This doll is Chelsea.Is Amazon out of Madison dolls? I just wish someone here at Amazon/Toys R Us would correct this error. I didn't give a good rating on stars because it's the wrong doll. If Amazon puts the right doll up then I'll score it better. I just want to make sure that I don't end up purchasing 2 Chelsea dolls should I decide to buy them for my girls.
2,Dissapointed,"Slide door was difficult to close, no matter how carefully I tried to work it in. Upon further examination, I found that the right spindle would not move into proper position to play the tape. I want to clarify that this is no fault of the seller. The adapter was factory sealed, therefore it was a manufacturing defect."
3,VIDEO CASSETTE ADAPTER,OK....PRODUCT....ARRIVED AS OK.....WILL USE PRODUCT TO TRANSFER OLD CASSETTE TO DVD ..HOPE IT WILL BE OK FOR ABOUT 150 TRANSFERS
5,Excellent look at the Navy from the inside,I've thoroughly enjoyed the look inside the Navy that this series provides. It takes you below the deck of the USS Nimitz for a look at day-to-day operations while on a 6-month deployment. Getting to know the people gives you much greater respect for any man or woman in uniform and the struggles they go through at sea and back home. Enjoyed every minute of this.
2,It's nothing more than a long commercial,"Don't bother watching it, wait for the finished copy to be shown on the TV."
1,"Boring, boring boring","I can't say that I found one interesting thing in this entire preview. Not a single little piece of the actual content of the series (which looks boring enough), but just a non-stop infomercial.I would recommend that you not waste your time (as I wish I had done)."
1,Boring and not what I expected,"The series and title promise an in-depth view behind the curtains of a marvellous piece of technology. Instead I always felt like watching a boy-scout documentary with the toys of an overkilling weaponery. If this is what the navy feels like, then I am surprised. Comradery, a cruise to see the world and playing with billion-dollar equipment... Is it really like that on such a ship? I doubt it.I wished to see more tech details and if getting philosophical: a more inside look into the hearts and souls of those (mostly) teenies on that ship. I find it rather unbelieveable and I can smell the censorship on every take of this movie. The footage itself is very nice."
1,A shame to the Naval service,"I've watched several episodes of the PBS mini-series Carrier and, I think the production was unfortunate and a huge mistake by The Navy.On the other hand, there's also some evidence to support the remark by one lower-level sailor that it's ""a big-a- floating high school."" The unusually candid and personal portrait of life aboard the Nimitz should have been taken more seriously.Since this program focuses on the reality tv approach its material does not always and fully represent the discipline, values and mission of the Naval service."
2,"Uninteresting, Off the Mark","The Nimitz class aircraft carriers are tremendously fascinating and this series managed to make it boring. The focus on the private lives of many of the featured crew members was uninteresting and unnecessary. We don't need an aircraft carrier as the backdrop in order to tell petty stories of personal relationships. On top of that, the filmmakers focused on what appear to be among the least inspired and satisfied crew members. To watch this series, I would be left thinking that pretty much everyone in the Navy hates their job and has issues with the command system that has existed in militaries since the beginning of time. It was not as good as I hoped."
1,Reality TV really?,"If you want to learn about an aircraft carrier then don't get this DVD. If you want a reality show done on board a large boat that is carrying weapons, airplanes, and lots of older teenagers, then watch this looong boring PBS show. I'm embarrassed for our navy that they let these ""reporters"" on board. it appears to be a way to make the navy look weak. Sad."
1,intrusive music soundtract,"This DVD looked like it was going to be interesting, but then the soundtract started: bad pseudo-rock with inane lyrics played continuously just loud enough to interfere with the dialogue. I returned it in spite of the $17 loss. Don't buy it unless you like to listen to Grand Funk Railroad at full volume while trying to balance your check-book."
1,bad show-bad Navy,"I think this show limits itself mostly on people who don't have any sense of pride and self esteem.I am very surprised that a show would be able to destroy the fascinating part of an Aircraft Carrier like this!!I agree with others that there is far to much vulgar language used in the entire 10 episodes.It starts kind of interesting and than it seems like it is repeating itself over and over again.Tragical for whoever thinks that the military is a ""high school"".This is one of the worst shows there is out on the market.I don't recommend this at all for nobody's sake.Please stay away from this, it's totally not worth Your time and money."
5,got me through my pre-lims !,"This book is chock full of current ""problems"" in systematics and species concepts. I was able to use several of these stories to pass my oral pre-lims in entomology and systematics!I told the author so in an email! :)This was a few years ago - and now I'm returning to this book again in order to locate or develop a post-doc."
2,couldn't remove peach fuzz :-(,"My wedding is coming up and I was so nervous my ""peach fuzz"" or little blonde/white hair would show up in close-up pictures so I thought this would be a great alternative to waxing. I assumed it wouldn't irritate my skin as much or hurt as much. I was wrong. Not only did it cause my skin to become red and irritated it felt like a chemical burn while it was on my face. I left it on for 4-5 minutes, just dealt with pain (no pain no gain right?), and afterwards wiped the cream off only to find that all of my hair was still there! Maybe it depends on your skin and hair type. I have fair sensitive skin and very thin hair. I figured it would sting a bit, but to not remove any hair!worth a try but I'm not going to buy this stuff every again."
1,Disappointing,Was Not a big fan of this book. Expected more and better images. Too bad. Wish the promos for it had been clearer about the content and layout. Very disappointing.
1,A terrible book for children,"I am amazed that anyone would give this garbage a good review. Poor grammar abounds in this book. Examples include, ""we ain't prejudiced or nothing"" (p. 7), ""you got any gum"" (p. 10), ""these dogs don't have much manners"" (p. 13), ""I ain't even using my nails to hang on"" (p. 16), and ""there's these sick dogs that need some pills or something"" (p. 26). A certain type of adult might find this style of writing amusing, but to write like this in a children's book is simply appalling. Penguin Young Readers Group should be ashamed of this mess."
4,I love this product.,We had the Everpure system in our home for over 20 years now and we love it! All you need to do change the cartridge once a year and it filters the water properly. Changing the filter is a breeze. I would recommend this product to everyone.
5,Still tastes great!,Our Everpure filter system continues to work well for us and the replacement cartridges are easy to install. I am also happy with how quickly I received the filter.
5,Pure water with the H-300 filter from Everpure,"I've had an Everpure filter on our household drinking water for almost 20 years. I recently ordered a replacement filter cartridge. I found that my model was discontinued, but that the H-300 would fit.When I tried to remove the old cartridge, it was stuck. I called Everpure for some tips, and, instead of selling me a new unit, they sent me one free of charge!It installed easily and works great."
3,"Great tasting water, easy to use, BUT you may need to replace quickly","Great tasting water, dead simple to install and maintain, but it can get clogged very easily such that water flow slows to a very low rate ie. 15 mins/gal!After two weeks the filter slowed to a nearly unusable flow rate. I found out that this is because it has a small micron filter and any sediment that comes into the filter will begin to clog it. So, if they dig up a pipe around you and some dirt flows in your filter, or if you have a bit heavy sediment the flow will be greatly reduced to the point of being useless.So far it seems you need to also install a prefilter to prevent this."
1,Everpure filter unsealed from Amazon,I have ordered this filter from Amazon before and had no problem. In the last 2 days I have received two filters (the second a replacement for the first) from Amazon. In both cases the cellophane seal was torn and the plastic cap that protects the part of the filter that goes into the system under the sink was off and flopping loose in the carton. The filters have always been delivered sealed and I am appalled that Amazon obviously has a bad batch. I will pay more from another seller to get this in new condition.Everpure EV9270-74 H-300-HSD Replacement Cartridge
1,ARRIVED WITHOUT ORIGINAL PACKAGING,"arrived loose in the shipping box without original box, instructions or replacement timer!!!!I've bought these from Amazon before without problems and as pictured on the websight...then had to spend ages on phone to AMAZON trying to get issue sorted.. they are nowsending me another but could not promise it would arrive any different... stand by..."
2,disappointed,the package was open and i wasnt sure if i got a new one like I paid for a Little disappointed
5,perfect,Product was exactly what was ordered and on time.Could not have asked for anything moreWill certianly order again
5,great water filter,"I have been using the H300 of Everpure for a couple of years. I have bought it for the first time online via Amazon; everything was perfect, fast and complete delivery.I will buy next year the new one on Amazon too.Paul Hofmann, CA"
5,H300 Everpure water filter,The H-300 Everpure water filter has been on use for well over 30 days. This is my third filter from Everpure and the new one I installed in March 2012 works well and makes our water taste better.
1,Defective product,"After using the product for a few months, debris began to appear in the filtered water. This came from the filter."
3,Just had the cartridge installed.,"Large but recommended by our plumber as the best system. This filter is to last a year, approximately and has an alarm on it to notify me when it is time to replace the filter, based on its use. Pretty smart design!"
4,"Works great, lasts a long time.",This is my 3rd replacement and it does its job. For one year of filtration this is it! You can even taste the difference in water.
3,"NIce filter, sloppy packaging","It filters water to nice drinking taste. The cost is way too expensive, especially considering that it needs to be replaced every year. Useless battery operated beeper to let me know when year is up. I'd rather the cost was less. Haven't the manufacturers heard of computerized to do lists? It wasn't padded well in shipping. The delivery time was slow now that the holiday buying frenzy has ended."
2,Everpure H-300,"Got to give it 2 stars because value vs gallons filtered.Foods and coffee taste great using the filtered water, for that I'd give it 5 stars."
4,Everything You Always Wanted to Know...,"Trying to recapture the significant events of one of baseball's most storied franchises - the St Louis Cardinals - is indeed a daunting task; John Snyder's effort is worthy, although some of the details needed to be edited a bit more thoroughly. Granted, the essence of this book is terrific; however, for a diehard Cards fan with a photographic memory, I noticed a few typos and reporting errors; nothing significant, but still in need of a little ""housekeeping"" before publication.Perhaps the editing will be a little tighter for the next revised edition; otherwise, no complaints. It's still a welcome edition to my baseball history collection, and a nicely condensed summary of my favorite team's activities over the years."
4,gift for dad,i ordered this book as a birthday gift for my dad who is an avid cardinals fan. he loved it and it seemed very interesting.
2,"A Casebook of Crime, Conspiracy and VIP Victims","The flash of a dagger - the crack of a pistol or rifle - the blast of a bomb: the impact of political and religious assassinations has reverberated through the centuries. Julius Caesar, Tomas Becket, Abraham Lincoln, Rasputin, Martin Luther King, Gandhi and John F. Kennedy - all have died by an assassin's hand.Unfortunately the author of this book has decided to go for breadth rather than depth. The 160 odd pages cover more than 200 assassinations, resulting in most of the assassinations getting only one or two paragraphs. This is a great shame because when Bailey does go into detail about some of the really famous assassinations the details prove to be riveting reading. The Assassination File would have been better if only 30 or so assassinations were covered in more detail."
2,Sizing Problems,I am a size 8.5 and ordered a size 9 in this shoe. I couldn't even begin to get my foot into this shoe. I am not even sure if a size 10 would have been adequate but because of the hassle of not being sure if a size 10 or a size 11 would have been a good fit I just gave up.
2,Fair,"I received the CD with the case broken. When I opened up the cracked and broken case the CD itself was OK, so I kept it instead of adding additional cost to the seller to re-send another one out.Lisa"
3,20th Century Masters - The Millennimum Collection - The Best of Tom Jones,"I was little disappointed with one song. I love one song was an original ""It's Not Unusual"" and it's doesn't sound like an original record in earlier which I saw on the video. Sound like second record with different music...."
4,Under-rated historical release,"This is essential, collection wise. Warning: He had a very weird sounding voice. And this collection doesn't have the best of notes. Just the standard ""Curb"" fair: One page of ho-hum notes. These are the original recordings of all his Top Ten songs. And for a cheap price."
5,This Vampire Would Never Consent To An Interview!!!,"Something is very amiss in London in this book set in Victorian times. Somebody is killing the Vampires who sleep by day and feast by night. University Language Professor James Asher is employed by Lonon's most powerful Vampire, Don Yisidro to track dowm the killer. The author takes the reader on a fascinating journey through the streets and back alleys of London into a world of Darkness which James fears he will never return from. This book is full of unexpected twists and turns and would have to be my favourite Vampire novel. Just writing this review makes me want to read it again. Ms. Hambly captures the atmosphere of times past with a deft hand and proves that she is a wonderful Storyteller."
1,Automatic nothing is about what it did. So frustrating.,"We have had a battery shop for many years and have several fast chargers among our 20 or so. We were really hoping for a charger that did about everything even though it could only do one battery at a time. We tried about every way to get this one to work with something. We tried dead batteries and not so dead, almost fully charged and everything in between. We have other much older chargers that got stuff up this would not. It charged only slightly on a few batteries and did not top anything off according to specific gravity or acid levels. We wasted a lot of time trying to mess with this thing.Unless this one was just defective..."
5,love it,"I had bought this item 2 years ago at boarders by my school. I have stacks of written journals at home so when i get older i can pass them down to my children and they can read about how i lived my life as i grew up now when ever i wrote in it i felt inspired. each and every quote in thisjournal is simply amazing and beautiful. its like it brings your deepest and inner thoughts to life. my favorite quote of all is from Earnest Hemingwayit is on the last page of the journal and its say's "" If two people love each other there can be no happy end to it"" by far this is my favorite quote in the entire journal.i would defiantly buy this journal again. <3"
5,I love it!!,"This is an absolutely beautiful diary the paper is wonderful quality the quotes are amazing that is why I love this journal so much, they are inspirational funny and seductive. I had filled one i recieved as a gift and when i was shopping for a new diary and ran across the same one i just had to have because i knew the quality was excellent!!! Plus it will be like reading the quotes for the first time again!!!"
3,not bad,The lock did not work I had to break it apart to get inside. but the inside has pretty illustrations and nice quotes.
2,Pretty Journal But Needs More Space,Very nice book however if you are a serious writer you will want more room. As another reviewer stated you will need a replacement in less than a year.
4,My most beautiful journal...,"For someone whom has written in journal's for the last 10yrs, this was a very welcome addition to the collection when it was recieved! The cover is georgeous, its thick and durable, it has a lock, the pictures on the pages and the pages themselves are beautiful, and the quotes on each page that in enticing, but not erotic. If you're looking for a journal that is above par quality-wise in comparison to all the other journals on the market, short of leather, then get this one!God Bless ~Amy"
4,A beautifully constructed book,"A lovely book combining haiku and beautifully reproduced Japanese paintings. Definitely in the fine tradition of Tuttle Publishing. The haiku were selected based on the preferences of the editor. I appreciated many of them, but thought too many of them deviated from the modern haiku style of not stating the poet's feelings outright, but using objective descriptions to elicit emotions. It's a matter of personal taste."
2,Gorgeous pictures but how do you get there?,"I've owned this book for several years and have gone through all of the exercises at least twice over those years. I am totally puzzled by the other reviewer's rave reviews. Jan's paintings are absolutely gorgeous; in fact, she is my favorite watercolor painter- but don't expect to be able to paint anything like her after studying this book. There are many, many important techniques covered in this book, but the descriptions of how to do the different techniques are completely inadequate. There are only four steps for each demonstrated painting and there is no way you can produce a picture anything like Jan's by following those steps- unless you already know how to do those techiques. And I am an intermediate painter, not a beginner, just so you know. If you want to buy a book with lots of pictures of beautiful flower paintings in it, go for it, but don't expect to become a flower painter from it."
3,Sweet chelsea!,This chelsea has the cool yet fashonable look. Most of the time now they make chelsea look sleazy and out spoken. I think this doll has the sweet look and that's what mattel should make chelsea look like all the time! My friend and I play like she's an english accent and it looks so her!!!!! So i think every girl that's a my scene fan should get her!!!(I want too). ByeSicily #2 my scene fan
3,day to nite chelsea,this doll has a pretty face. Unfortunately her clothes are not that stylish. the coat that's included is kinda stiff and she's sort of dressed down. Overall it's an ok add on to my collection
3,"uhh,","Umm, Nollie, Zoe didnt even say she thought this doll wasn't cute. She was listing the stuff that The My Scene HAVN'T came up with."
1,uhhh.....,"My Scene hasn't thought of Twins, Sports, Babys, Wild West, Blind Date, Treasures, Birthday, or Campfire. and they DID make something like the Day and NIght. They made Midnight!!!!!!-zoe"
2,She is kinda ugly,"Chelsea is my favorite my scene character,but this one is kinda ugly.I dont like her.SARA SIBLINI!!!MY SCENE LOVER!!!BRATZ LOVER!!!*FOREVER*"
1,I hate My Scene dolls,I hate My Scene dolls. Bratz are better. Get a Bratz doll instead of a My Scene doll. My Scene dolls are ugly anyway.
4,And at the back....,"Yes, it's a very good album with some fine songs. I'd just like to direct potential listeners to the unsung hero of this recording: drummer Dr Rick Jaeger. The extremely funky and loose-limbed percussionist has my vote as one of the greatest back-up musicians plying his trade at the time the album was made. Hats off to The Doctor."
5,THE BEST DAVE MASON CD IN MY OPINION,I DISAGREE WITH THE OTHER REVIEW. THE LIVE STUFF ON THIS CD IS TOP NOTCH. TE VERSION OF WORLD IN CHANGES MAKES ALONE TOGHETHER SOUND LIKE DEMO's. THE STUDIO TRAX ARE THE ICING BUT THE LIVE STUFF IS THE CAKE. TOTALLY RECOMENDED.. HIS BAND ON THIS RECORD IS TO DIE FOR!
3,One-half of a great Dave Mason album,"This album's release in 1972 was done over Dave Mason's objections; he complained that it was incomplete, as only five studio tracks appear here. It ticked him off enough that he left Blue Thumb (who originally put this album out) for Columbia. Well, he's partly right; the live cuts that make up the remainder of the album are pretty slipshod, featuring two perfunctory re-makes from his days with Traffic and the remaining three from his first solo album, ALONE TOGETHER, which have nowhere near the omph of their studio counterparts. But HEADKEEPER's studio side is pretty darn good, particularly the mysterious title cut and the country-tinged ""A Heartache, A Shadow, A Lifetime."" The latter features Graham Nash doing some gorgeous high harmony behind Mister Dave. Not his best, but not his worst either. That came later in his career."
5,"An excellent, proven glaze for your paint.","We've been using 3M Hand Glaze for over a dozen years now with excellent results. Hand Glaze will hide minor scratches and swirls in your paint and also provide an excellent gloss in preparation for your favorite wax. Wax protects but glaze provides the shine. Use it twice a year at a minimum to rejuvenate your paint.Insure that you follow the instructions correctly on the bottle in order to use this product correctly. Apply the product with a cotton cloth or foam applicator, rub in very well and buff out immediately (don't allow the product to dry on the paint) with cotton or microfiber. Lower humidity conditions seem to make this product a bit easier to work with.You must wax over the top of this glaze. We've used it on our daily drivers as well as our concours only car. It really makes a car pop when you use glaze!Highly recommended!"
3,Good part and fit,Price was a little steep compared to other sources of this replacement part. Shipping and service were great
2,cheap,"shakes real bad,seems like a cheap ripoff. would have paided more for one that works.I think that it would have been better to pay for a gmc part."
2,Buy the cheaper one.,"I purchased this one even though there is another one currently listed on Amazon for a lot less. The main complaint with the other(cheaper)one is that the mirror vibrated more than the stock mirror. So I paid more for this one looking for a better quality product, but I am really disappointed. The mirror on this one vibrates enough that you cannot tell what type of vehicle is behind you.Should have purchased the cheaper one."
2,Bummer,I purchased this to replace the origional mirror that was broken by unknown persons in a parking lot . It looks almost the same as the origional but thats where the similarity ends . The glass vibrates like crazy at freeway speeds and to top it all off - it makes a weird whistling sound . I recommend that people spend a few more dollars and get a mirror from the manufacturer . Don't waste your money on this !
4,Nice,"I checked prices this is a good deal, nice set. Have to get a few single bits to complete the set. The case will hold them and keep them together."
4,good in the car,We put one of these in our car. The Prius has an outside temperature but not an inside temperature so we used some velcro and mounted one to ourdash rug right over the steering column and now we have inside and outsidetemperature. Real nice.
4,Great little thermometer,More interesting than an old fashioned room thermometer. I like the little graphics that show the sun or clouds or rain.
4,Good stuff cheap,Just what we wanted: a simple weather station that tells us what the weather will be like. It can be used indoors on a refrigerator (not recommended; you will know the exterior temp of the fridge!) or on the wall.
3,Flexees - Decent for your money,It's not the most comfortable but it does it's job. The bad part its really tight and there are 2 or 3 bra type hooks on the back that is VERY hard to hook. It does give you a smooth look though.
2,"poor result,high cost","Because of taxes, i paid well over the odds for a pretty poor item. It doesnt support very well, and bearly has any 'pull-in' technology...which is why i wanted it! $51, for the item, $27 postage, and on its return an unexpected bill 27 customs and excise bill!!! Totally ripped for a useless item. Very poor indeed."
2,Flexees strapless slip,"I do not have much to tell you about this product. I tried it on, and it was too big. They did not have the size smaller so I returned it for a refund."
2,Not good for full figured women,"Flexees Women's Firm Control Strapless Slip with Convertible Straps #3741I really had high hopes for this, I love Flexees but this one is a huge disappointment. I wore it under a summer dress and the bottom kept scooting up and the top sits lower than what I would have liked. The worst part was that any give in the fabric works it's way right to your stomach so there was very little control there. It made my stomach look bigger than what I am - I was so uncomfortable. I think they have a few issues going on with this product. 1) Sizing is off. 2) Does not control like stated (in my case - made it worse). I'm fine with the rest of their products, I absolutely love Maidenform and the Flexee line but this was a disaster! The problem size for me was 36C, in case anyone was wondering."
5,functional undergarmet,"I purchased this to wear under strapless dresses (including my wedding dress) and have worn it several times. It seems to work pretty well. The garmet is a little on the short side, which makes it ride up a little with movement (sitting and standing, dancing, etc.). For the price, I'd recommend it, especially to those who don't plan on wearing it a whole lot."
2,Does not hold in the tummy,i bought this for a special occasion to wear a certain dress. This does not do what it claims. The top stays up nice but there is no control of the stomach. If you need control shop else where.
2,control slip,"I don't like this product at all. It rides up and you are constantly tugging at it to get it back where it belongs. If you are siting and then have to get up, it rides up and can be seen under the clothing. Don't buy it."
1,Great book - bad reprint,"This edition contains only text - there is not a single plate or illustration included. This may baffle you, as it baffled me when I received it - since the title and subject of the book obviously refers to the art of Repton.But there you have it. Caveat emptor. I hope that this is useful to someone!"
3,Nice sense of place and time,"If you read this for the sense of place (Paris, 1925)and the glimpses of literary figures of the time, then you'll enjoy it and the mystery related to the Jack de Paris killings will be icing on your cake. But if you expect the mystery to be in the foreground and you aren't interested in portrayals of Hemingway, Fitzgerald, and others, then you're liable to be disappointed."
1,Pitiful,"I bought this book because it was coupled with a book by Cara Black. Talk about mislabeling! The dialog is a pitiful attempt to replicate the delightful repartee of contemporaneous period pieces. The gratuitous racism might have been real (but I doubt it). The story builds slowly and I never developed the least interest in any of the characters. To put this in context I love Feydeau, Sayers, Stout, Charteris, and Simenon--all of whom outperform Engel in their sleep."
4,sturdy chair,"got rocking chair, delivery was fine, put it together and some drilled holes did'nt line up but it was an easy assembly. All in all its a good little chair, would have gave it 5 stars except for the hole alignment."
1,Don't even think about it...,H. P. Lovecraft must have rolled over in his grave when this thing came out. A total waste of time and effort. I had more fun (and was more scared) when I got my wisdom teeth pulled out! Putting the name Cthulhu on this is like putting Bill Gate's name on a soft-porn shareware title. Save your money-you're more likely to be scared watching cartoons with your cable out than by watching this.
1,"No, please no!!!!!!!","What, no ""zero star"" rating?!?!? There should be!This little cube of ipecac oil wins the all time, ""how dare you do this to Lovecraft"" award. Aside form having ""Cthulhu"" in the title, I didn't see ANY relevance to ANYTHING Lovecraftian. It was badm even for a bad movie, and whoever used HPL as anything on it will surely burn in hell.Suck, suckfest, suckling, suck-o-rama, sucktarded, you name it, it fits.Only watch it if you want to get mad.This one doesn't even deserve and elder god rating.Peeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee Youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!!!"
2,Very little di Stefano,"I ordered this one to add to my di Stefano collection, but there is very little of him on the recording. I assumed that since it was titled Giuseppe diStefano there would be his arias and duets. (There's more Belcore than Nemorino). Guess I should have read which excerpts were on the CD before purchasing it. <grin> No ""Quanto e bella"", ""Perche"", or Scene 2 Duet; and ""Adina , credimi"" is too scratchy to enjoy. (Sounds as though it was copied from a old 78. Worse than most bootlegs.)The saving grace is a separate recording of his ""Una furtiva"" accompanied by piano."
3,Leslie West is back,It's funny to hear that the old goat is back and he's still alive and kickin'. Lots of guitars as allways. Good sound and it's a typically leslie west album. Good songs and performance. a must for all his fans of course.
4,This is a compilation,"There are no liner notes, or anything on the CD or its cover to so indicate, but if you look at these songs as part of Leslie's catalog, they were released in the 10 or so years preceeding this disc.That being said, it amounts to a post-Mountain ""best of"". Stormy Monday and Third Degree especially sound fine, but the rest of the album is good too. I would have liked some real liner notes, but the music is tasty."
3,Been there-done that!,"I agree with ""Joe"" in that most of these tracks have been released on other albums over the years. If you want new Leslie West material buy ""Blues to die for"" which is a really good album."
2,guitared,I found this to be weak. covers are feeble at best. a sign of that current time in music history
2,Not as described,"Fits a 460CC driver, a little tough to get on but it fits. However the cover I received was blonde! WTF! The one in the picture is dark brown....like a beaver. Really disappointed with the color."
1,Don't waste your money!!,"We purchased this item because it claimed to fit any driver. It doesn't.The headcover is too small to fit over an older Taylormade Bubble.I'm sure it's too small for anything newer.What a waste. Overpriced to begin with, but now worth nothing.If you have a five wood or a hybrid club it might work."
3,Sure Connect?,"Everything works good in this kit. I hate having to have a 'dock' attached to my radio. This radio requires a dock be connected to it. XM Sure Connect? WTH is that? I'll hold off until I can get my AUX in working. Also, the FM transmitter did not work as expected...at all. I'm gonna keep it, it was cheap. I guess you get what you pay for."
5,Missing recipe,As a native of Jamaica I knew exactly what to look for in this book. Although this book contained many wonderful recipes from my country I was dismayed to find that it did not contain the recepe for Jamaican rum cake or any kind of fruit cake recipes. This cake is a tradition in most Jamaican households during the Christmas holidays and is very popular at weddings. A Jamaican wedding is not complete without rum cake or fruit cake.I hope the author will take this into consideration when writing the international edition.
4,Nice,"It's a cool cd. I like it. A nice compilation. You gotta be in a chill mood to really enjoy this cd, other wise, its nice music."
5,excellent chill-out music,"excellent chill-out / lounge music, perfect for restaurants or any place where you want to relax and take a deep breath..."
5,Take a deep breath and exhale !!!!,"Ive had this cd in my wish list for so long befor finally deciding to purchase it. I almost knocked myself in the head for waiting so long upon hearing it. This music creates a soothing, sensual and serene atmosphere. The songs flow into one another, so it may be a disatvantage to shuffle cd or when you want to put it on your ipod.( I simply have it alone as a playlist for ipod). This is a good chill out cd for a casual get together or dinner. If you like blue stone, delirium, enigma ...then you will like this cd. (by the way jen gad is the other guy from enigma)"
1,What a shame!,"Another one of those numerous collections of xenophobic rubbish published by a couple of (obviously) uneducated opportunists! Not even worth the honor of the ""poubelle"" I threw this one in!"
3,Not the right size for a 6001?,Length:: 0:43 MinsMy video review showing that the tamper is actually too long for the ACME 6001 juicer.
1,plunger,I have no idea what this is and didn't order it! Please wish someone could recheck to see if this was sent to me.
5,Acme 6100 Juicer,"So here is the skinny. Check the model number under the juicer. if it is 6W, that means it was made AFTER the Waring company purchased the Acme juicer, around 1987. These juicers could use the 4"" plunger (the one pictured) if your juicer DOESN'T have a model # with a W, then you may have an older model (pre 1987) that uses the 3.5"" plunger, which unfortunately doesn't seem to available....hope that helps!!"
4,Simple rhymes & bright pictures engage toddlers,"My son (16 months) just adores this book and will have me read it over and over. The simple rhymes and bright pictures of familiar objects (bananas, pancakes, socks, shoes, etc.) fascinate him. He loves the balloons and will point to each one in turn. I give it four stars only because I wish it was longer!"
5,Mr. Fordo,"Lord of the Rings was made for Risk! You can either use the new Lord of the Rings rules or standard Risk rules. This game follows up to the end of the Two Towers, since the game map does not include Gondor or Mordor, which will be in the third movie installment. By looking at this game board, I'm sure that there will be some ""expansion pack"" which will include Gondor and Mordor that can be attached to this current board.Most die hard Risk enthusiasts might not enjoy the rule changes, but that's just human nature. Give the new rules a try and it'll be a new twist to Risk.I'm a big Risk fan and also a big LOTR fan and this is the prefect board game for those that love LOTR. If you already have Risk, then try to tricksey a friend into getting this as I doubt you'd want two versions of a similar board game."
3,"Good ideas, but bad implementation by manufacturer","My wife & I have been playing Risk for nearly 20 years, and have seen many different editions. We like the new strategy options offered in this version by way of the second deck of cards and the ""leader"" game piece that each person has (which adds +1 to the roll of the die). Also, the territories have ""strongholds"" which add +1 to defense rolls. Pretty neat.However, there are two things we don't like. First, the map is WAY too busy to be functional. Middle-Earth names are NOT short, and when you cram 5-10 game pieces on top of a small territory, no one knows what it is. Then, when you try to uncover it to see if it matches the card in your hand, everyone knows what you're looking for. Also, we think simpler game pieces (not orcs, eagles, elves, etc.) would be easier to identify and use, though they don't add to the whole ""middle earth"" theme.Final note: BEST played by 4 players, not 2 or 3. Can't play with more than 4."
4,LOTR Disappointment,"I bought a LOTR Risk (not trilogy) board as it was much cheaper and was very annoyed that it didn't have Mordor and Gondor on it - it only tells you this on the instructions, INSIDE the wrapped box. There was also a leaflet inside it with the Expansion Board advertised on it, but all sites say that this is OUT OF PRINT! Following this, I decided to draw my own but I am still longing for that Minas Tirith game!"
1,How do you play?,"Gave this game to my 9-year-old son for Christmas. The rules that came with the game do not adequately describe how the game is played. When do you read the cards? It says I can move my leader during any turn? Have never played the original Risk game (and never will), so maybe people who have played that game will understand how to play this one. The kids are playing now and having fun, but they're making up their own rules as they go. Very frustrating. Sorry I bought the game."
3,Risk:Lord of the Rings Trilogy Edition,"There was great anticipation and excitement upon opening the box and setting out the various pieces, however, after going through the instructions in the manual and online, there was some disappointment as to how to get started. If it was played like Risk, then no problem! If it was to be played Risk:Lord of the Rings, then how does it work? We will keep at it!"
2,"True to Risk, but not to Middle Earth","First of all, it is a decent game, but there are some glaring flaws.The first thing i noticed when i looked at the map is that there is NO GONDOR OR MORDOR! That's like having a standard Risk map without the continents of Asia and Australia. Unthinkable. The map itself looks unfinished in the south, which could mean they hope to make a second edition of this game and just connect the two maps.The LotR rules of leaders and missions make this game play like Castle Risk, which is fine. You also have the option to play the game with standard Risk rules. This too, is fine, except there can be only four players.Buyer beware."
5,Back to Basics,"After doing 3 years of research and trying to keep up with techniques and equipment, I sometimes get overwhelmed by the raw food world. This video took me back to basics and boosted my confidence. I was reminded that raw foods can be easy and fast. Victoria's 5 flavor formula makes everything simple and delicious! Now, if I get exhausted by my raw food gourmet ""cookbook"", I just put in this dvd and get back on track."
5,very well thought out,"I enjoyed the read, but I love Araina Franklin's novels. Each of her books are amazing. If you haven't read her books, try this!"
3,excellent book if had been written by a different author...,This would be an excellent book if it had been written by a different author... The ending was amazing! but i would have a hard time recommending this book to anyone. The author's writing style is a bit strange and the EXCESSIVE use of curse words is just totally unnecessary. All the characters seemed to have very few morals. But other than that the plot was good. Instead of waisting your time reading the whole book I would recommend reading a detailed summery and the last two chapters of the book. Though the last two chapters seem to help you forget the errors of the previous ones. Thus the high ratings.
1,Poorly written Fairy Tale,"This book doesn't deserve the rating it's getting......really. The writing is extreemly poor and hard to follow. The mystery and history is all that carries this book along and it's shallow. It seems she went into this book just to get to the twist ending which everyone seems to love otherwise they wouldn't rate this book so highly. Everyone's a hopeless romantic, just as the character in the book says, and a doop. They forget all flaws and give it a 5 star rating. Weak!Read the low reviews on her book The Mistress of the Art of Death (great title but bad book) and you'll learn more about her awkward and inaccurate writing style. Don't waste your time."
4,A good read,"Not as predictable as some reviewers would have you believe. City of Shadows is a step up from the Mistress of the Art of Death series, which puts it at a pretty high level. Ms. Franklin's writing was already excellent and gets better here. Her plotting is complex (but remains believable), she does a wonderful job of fleshing out her characters, and she uses the setting and time (Berlin between the wars), and what we know about what's coming, very effectively in racheting up the suspense. Even the sprinkling of cameos by historical figures (Hitler, Goering, etc.) make sense and were non-gratuitous -- a nice change from most of the current crop of historical novels. A very enjoyable read."
4,Her Best Work,"This is Ms. Franklin's best work. Unlike her ""Mistress of the Art of Death"" serious, this novel was not predictable and had a twist ending I didn't see coming. Additionally, more attention was payed to character development than usual. I'd love to read more books from this time period and/or genre."
4,Historical Mystery--City of Shadows,I purchased City of Shadows as a gift. My sister is very excited about Ariana Franklin and likes her stories very much.
1,Predictable,"I knew exactly how this story was going to end after the first couple of chapters. And the obvious ""mistakes"" with not only the language used but historical notes, were so glaring I had hard to time trying to get thru this book. As stated on the cover this author is British, and unfortunately she used way to much British slang to give any authenticity to this story that's taking place in Germany.In other words, it's a ""bloody"" mess from start to finish. Got that kiddo? I could go on, but I already wasted enough time on this sorry excuse for a thriller."
4,SUSPENSE IN THE SHADOWS,"This book has it all. A strong atmospheric setting, entwined with wonderful characters, and a plot that challenges the good guys to find a merciless killer before he finds them.Set in pre World War II Berlin, this novel will give you a peek at what fueled the political movement that grew in power and became Nazi Germany. It also provides another view of the Anastasia story, and has a suprise ending that few will be able to guess before reading the last 5 pages.This clever thriller will absolutely leave you breathless."
4,Pretty fun,"This game is actually pretty fun. The main mode is a tour mode where you tour the country and go to different stadiums,off road races and exibitions, you earn points towards the champoinship in the stadiums, and earn money to get into the stadiums and buy upgrades for your truck. There is also a single race mode and a training mode where you can play or race any tracks you have unlocked in tour mode. There are also stars hidden in all the off-road tracks, amd if you find all the stars in one track, you will unlock a different truck. Me, I just love going to training mode and just racing around going over jumps and destroying stuff.Only reason I gave it 4 stars is because of graphics and lack of commentary, the trucks and tracks look prett good tracks, but the characters just look weird. But besides this is is a great racing game, fun for all ages, with 3 difficulty levels to choose from. Just plain fun."
5,Same product at a fraction of the price.,"My cable was the exact same type I've seen in stores, but was only about a fourth the price. I received it faster than I could've made time to run to the store."
5,"Simple, good product",These are exactly as they appear pictured. Good for a smaller martini glass but would be swimming in a large one.
5,Martini picks,"These are wonderful, heavy, and a great size, they stay on the side of the glass. The plastic picks break and these do not."
5,"Cute Voice, Good Sound Quality",Sue Thompson had a nice high voice and some good hits. Her voice reminds me a little of Brenda Lee. Sound quality on this CD is excellent. Eleven songs are in flawless true stereo and sound as though they could have been recorded yesterday. Only track 11 is mono. Track listing is as follows:(1) Sad Movies (Make Me Cry) (2) Norman (3) James (Hold The Ladder Steady) (4) Paper Tiger (5) Have A Good Time (6) Two Of A Kind (7) I Can't Stop Loving You (8) Big Mable Murphy (9) Candy And Roses (10) Never Naughty Rosie (11) She Reminds Me Of Me (12) Tennessee Waltz
4,Sue Thompson - Greatest Hits,"This CD has some great old songs on it & brought back many memories of our era of music. ie ""Sad Movies"" & ""Norman""."
3,Fitz outdoes the Doctor!!!!!,"I love it when a Dr Who novel starts part way into the story. The Doctor, Compassion and Fitz are separated right from the beginning as a result from fleeing a doomed space station. Sadly I found the only interesting bits to be read were about Fitz's exploits on the other world, Mechta, a colony for convalescents, whereas the Doctor was tending not to do much and Compassion was being annoyingly annoying once again (still with no insight of who or what she is). The action and pace does pick up in the 3rd part of the story, giving the Doctor and Compassion a more interesting exciting role to play. Worth a read, but don't expect much from it."
1,went bad after first summer and parts are difficult to find and very expence,i bought this item two summers ago and on my second summer went out got a technician and the so far the switch is bad and is hard to find. one place was asking 200 for that switch this is just crazy and haier dont sell any of this because this ac is discontinue. i fanaly got a place were they sell it for 103 still too much for a simple on\off switch.
5,Solid Gold Holistique Blendz Basis-Plus Adult Maintenance Dog Food (33-lb bag),This is good food. I recommend it. It is low in protein and sodium. I give it to my Dobie because of his heart condition. He loves it.
4,A story of the little car that changed the world,"Tin Lizzie is a wonderful children's book that tells the story of the life of one 1909 Model T Ford, from New to Used to Junk to New again. The story is told simply, with an abundance of fanciful, yet factual, illustrations to delight the eye and ignite the imagination. In the telling, the reader (or listener) learns about the way life once was, and how it has changed over the years. As an antique car restorer, I find it to be an excellent book to share with my nieces and nephews so they might appreciate and understand what Uncle David sees in these old things he's always fixing. I even find some adults enjoy it!"
2,Not that Lucky,"Purchased this DVD purely because I feel Lauren Graham is a magnificant actress, but she featured very little in the movie, and I wasnt fussed on the story line, it was about him finding his past which didnt lead to a memorable movie. Lauren Graham as always was beautiful, but very little for her to exhibit her talents."
3,Lucky Thirteen,"This isn't a bad movie. There are some funny moments in it. But mostly, I think it's a movie for the fans of Lauren Graham. This movie was made in 1999 or 2000, so it was before ""Gilmore Girls"", and was released straight to video. And for Lauren's fans, she isn't in the movie nearly enough. Abbey (LG's character) isn't Lorelai, but Lauren's wonderful personality makes her just as endearing as Lor is. For a look at Lauren playing a character other than Lorelai Gilmore, check it out."
1,OH MY GOD>>>THE WORST FILM EVER!!!!!!,"Please please please please please please please...don't waste your time or your money...I bought it cos I liked Gilmore Girls but Lauren Graham is completely flat and uninteresting...the lead characfter lacks any charisma so you wonder how he got ANY women to sleep with him in the first place , let alone enough for a list... Zero plot, zero laughs...avoid like the plague...in fact, if it's between this and the plague itself, run towards those who look most sickly...!!!"
1,Bad purchase,I received a package to where it was no good. There was no cleaning solution in the bottle what so ever. I sent you an email about it and asked what you were going to do about it but I never received a response. I had to go buy another VCR cleaning kit so I could watch my movies. I will not recommend you to anyone I know.
1,No Good,I have this product and got it new. I have the same problem. Cleaner bottle emty. No good. I won't buy this product again. It is no good. I did not buy this from Amazon. Amazon will treat you right. I been shoping at Amazon for years. And if any thing is wrong with any product they will make it good. I will not buy Memorex no more. I am going with something else Amazon has.Thank you very much AmazonCalvin From New Castle INDIANA
1,Higest price does not guarentee the best choice!,I wish I had read the reviews first! I too received theitem with an empty cleaning fluid bottle! Bummer. ButAmazon is giving me a complete refund and paying my postage!
2,vcr,"these cleaner just dont work right, this is the 3rd onei tried, workes great the frist time then it stopes the vcr the second time, dont know why, i i did get the item real fast"
1,This IS Crap!!!,"I recently purchased this item ( not from Amazon) and was wondering why it just made a squeaking noise when inserted in my VCR- now I know why!! It's jamming up!! At least the small bottle with the cleaning liquid had something in it, for all the good it'll do."
3,Good team trivia game,"I got this game when it first came out in 2004. There's a wide range of ""experts"" in this game. From Bill Nye the Science Guy, to Batman's Adam West, to Hollywood Squares host Peter Marshall to astronaut Buzz Aldrin. Even Cleopatra is an expert, they managed to dig her up and ask her questions somehow. There are four playing pieces but the instruction book refers to teams taking turns, not individuals. The timer is more than a minute, it's more like a minute and 20 seconds. Answering more questions than the expert advances you on the board. I forgot exactly how to have to win, but you must reach the finish line first (yeah, you figured that out, I know).I haven't played this game recently, but I still have it in my collection. It takes about an hour. It moves at a good enough pace so it's not boring, but when another team is playing, you have to sit there and wait for your turn. It's not the best game, but believe me, I've played worse games than this."
2,???,I bought this game over 6 months ago and still haven't taken it out of the box. Many times I and several different friends have tried to read the instructions but it just didn't seem like any fun. It's still in my closet.
1,TOO small for FULL bed,"It's way too small for a full size bed-- the waterproof portion is only in the middle 2/3-- the ends are only single layer-- so the waterproof aspect doesn't cover the entire bed-- also, the flaps are not long enough to be tucked in all the way ! I had to sew waterproof pads at the end to make it work-- i bought two of them after reading such great reviews-- what a bummer !"
3,great for travel too,"I bought a full size pad for my son's twin bed, and we are able to use it in other sizes of beds too. It is not too bulky and it is nice for traveling. Since my son has not had any accident yet, I don't know how well it absorbs."
2,Buy it for the pictures,"I have a difficult time taking a book ""about the Rolling Stones"" seriously with next-to-no mention of Stu, Bill Wyman, Mick Taylor, Anita, or Marianne - and then trots out an ""essay"" by Sheryl Crow? Good pix, but ZILCH for any sort of ""literary content."" Don't pay more than $5 for it, it'll give you a hernia, and make you feel like you've been engaging in coitus interruptus."
2,Too short and fairly low quality,"This compilation does contain his most essential hits, but it has only eleven songs. Also, these have not been digitally remastered and the sound quality is inferior to other releases, so your money would be much better spent on one of the more recent anthologies or retrospectives. However, in addition to original recordings of the classic Cash songs, ""Ballad of a Teenage Queen,"" ""Guess Things Happen That Way,"" ""The Ways of A Woman in Love"" and ""Get Rhythm"" all make for good complementary tracks. No liner notes or any information apart from the track listing, no photos other than the one on the cover, just a shoddy release. I cannot recommend this CD unless you are able to pick it up for really cheap."
3,Boy Named *&%#@$!,"I got the CD with high hopes and for the most part, I love it! However, on the song, ""Boy Named Sue"" censors bleep out a supposed cuss word, which instantly killed it for me."
2,what the BLEEEP,"This CD is great, all for one major ""BLEEEP"" during Walk the Line. The rest of the songs are great, and as far as I remember, that's the only censored portion on the disc. I will still listen to it, but do get a little fired up for a few seconds each time."
5,Girls love gross stuff too!!!,I bought this game for my two girls..ages 8 and 6. They absolutely love it...lots of good gross stuff and lots of educational items even the adults thought were great. My husband and I even thought that this game would be great with our adult friends :)
5,Wonderful,I have purchased over 4 as gifts during the holidays and birthday present. It's a fun way to have children involved or take interest in Science. I would and have recommended this as a gift to others. It will be on my holiday list once again this year
4,Super fun!!,We bought this game for our son a few years ago. He is really into science and we had so much fun with this game. It would be a good way to get others who are not so into science interested.
4,"really fun, but the slime....","When my grandma bought this as a late birthday present I was most excited about the Totally Gross Slime. But when I took it out, it was dry and lumpy. It broke if I tried to stretch it, even when I rubbed it for thirty minutes. So I had to move it like a playing piece on the board. However, the game overall was hillarious and somewhat educating. And my 12 year old sister thought it was fun, which is saying something."
5,Fun for ENTIRE family!,This is hands down the most fun game we own! It really keeps us all entertained and engaged the entire time. My son is 5 and my daughter is 4 so they usually lose attention after about 15mins of a regular board game but not with this game. We always have so much fun and laughter while playing. It's very educational/interesting at the sametime. We learn something new everytime we play.
4,Totally Great,"We got the travel version of this game for a long train trip. For the right kind of kid it's a lot of fun. It isn't really much of a board game, just answering science type questions. The totally gross cards are fun, e.g. do things like 'burp your ABCs' and then it discusses why we burp. If your child read wells and likes question / answer games, it's a blast, and pretty silly and somewhat educational. In the end we ended up reading the cards more than following the board game rules. It was perfect for a trip. It is not however a game that you would play over and over, as once you've seen the questions and know the answer it sort of a mute point to play again."
4,Fun way to learn science.,"I bought this for my 13 yr old grandson. It's hard to find fun things that aren't video games, but this was definitely fun to play. Of all his gifts he wanted to play this game first. I even learned some new things about science!"
4,Gross is a learning axperience,"This games is a fun experience but played with boys the ""goo"" becomes quite a distraction!!! Some of the facts are ""gross"" but never too bazzar but definitely enlighten you. The younger children get a little bored but if you can keep the goo from poeples hands the game moves along well."
3,Expected it to be more fun,"We love family games, and purchased this because of the favorably reviews by other families. With 3 boys ranging in age from 6 to 13, anything with gross or potty humor usually is a hit in our house. Unfortunately, I think our expectations were a bit high for the reality of this game. Yes, there are some gross and disgusting scientific tidbits, and yes, using the green slime was very cool, but overall the game is just so-so. We don't actually play the game any more, but just take turns reading the cards/answering the questions. It's one of those games that's more fun when playing it with someone new who's never played it before.Based on our assessment, the game is probably best suited for ages 6-9 years, although some of the information might be above their knowledge level."
2,not sure how it got good ratings,"This game really isn't that fun. My nine year old likes it okay, but has only played it a couple of times. Really, once you've played it once, the fun is over. I wouldn't spend much money on it and wouldn't expect it to keep the attention of many for very long. It's just not one of those games that you keep coming back to. As far as rudeness, well...the game does say totally gross game. Without the gross stuff the kids wouldn't have any interest. So, lighten up and let the kids be kids and do some gross stuff. That's the only thing that makes this game entertaining~"
3,Not bad but not great,"My son (7) received this as a birthday gift. We have played it once so far, and the slime is a fun idea, but ours must have been older, so it didn't stretch like it should. We just took blobs of it and marked our places on the game board, and you could use Play-Doh or silly putty, etc. but it was a bit of a disappointment for my son, since that was the most exciting thing about opening the game. I like how it asked many good trivia questions relating to science, but the one ""Totally Gross"" card dared the player to sniff his fellow players butts (to compare what dogs do and why). Like most boys his age - he doesn't need any encouragement to do bathroom humor! Also. the lab experiment was decent, but the card just said ""If the player attempts to do the experiment"" not whether or not they were successful."
5,Totally Gross The Game,"This game was fun, learned a lot, easy to follow. The slim was gross. Fun game to add to your collection."
4,Great Game,"I purchased this for my 3 grandsons. They love it. They are 11, 10 and 7. They play it all the time"
2,Goo dried up!,I bought this for my daughter for Christmas because she likes anything gross and slimy. We opened it a few days ago and the goo (slime) inside that is used to play the game is completely dried up and hard. Without the slime there really is no game so its not alot of fun. Guess it has been sitting on the shelf too long??
2,Charming .... but there are better books,"The folksy information really isn't much for true gardeners but some may enjoy it. If you're really into gardening, there are far better books."
3,Good Table Top Book,"This is a fun and unusual Coffee Table Book, but I would really have like it to have a better (any) bibliography. My interest in history is such that I would have liked to know more then just the small amount of information this book provided.[...]"
1,goofy,"Dice: Deception, Fate & Rotten LuckWhat an abject waste of time and twelve or so bucks! The book is a few paragraphs of information on the history of using ""false"" dice in gambling. There are many arty photographs of celluloid dice in various stages of decomposition. Goofy - just goofy."
3,Drawn out,"First I must say I didn't realize this was a ""young readers"" book. So, for a younger reader they might like it alot more than myself. I like the premise of the book, but to agree with another review I too felt it was really drawn out and wasn't really that suspenseful."
1,Boring,"Like mentioned in another review, the animation/story was very generic. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Not even a rental."
1,"The worst kind of ""Christian"" videos.","I ordered this, hoping to show it to kids at my Episcopal church. Thank goodness I previewed it. As the roaches set up the story of Noah's ark, they are worried about an approaching hurricaine. One tells the other not to worry as hurricaines are ""just God's way of clearing away the things we don't need."" Is this really what the creators of this video believe? In light of the suffering caused by Katrina, the callousness of this sentiment takes my breath away."
4,Out of stock. They don't know if they will get it back,"I haven't tried these molds before, but they ran out before I could order it. The next time it comes back in stock I will get it then."
1,A horrid thing,This book was one of the worst I have ever read. Sorry to say I am giving the book way too much credit even giving it one star. If I were you I would not read this book. The only reason I read it was because I had to. It is extremely slow and has no action. And unless you love sick love stories that are boreing beyond anything I would stay away from Phoenix Rising.
4,A boy who gets leukimia because of a nuclear explosion.,"Pheonix Rising is about a boy named Ezra and he lived in a town were there had been a neuclear exposion. Ezra and his mother get away from their old town and a girl named Nyle and her grandmother take in the family. Ezra is very sick at the time that ezra arrieved at their house. When Ezra gets better is allowed to go outside with Nyle. What happens to Ezra might suprise you. So if you want to know the ending of this book, read Phoenix Rising."
4,Phoenix Rising,"Phoenix Rising was written by Karen Hesse. I really enjoyed this book because it showed me things I have never experienced before. The main character in this book is Nyle, she is 13 years old and she has a rough life. She went though a tough time because she has lose everyone in her family except her grandma. I think the author did a great job on using descriptive words. Nyle met a couple of new people and turned out to be her friends. She didn't really want new friends because she thought the same thing was going to happen to them that happened to the rest of her family. Overall I loved this book!"
1,Is Phoenix Rising a good book?,"In my personal opinion I thought this book was very slow moving and nothing excited happened until the end. In fact, the climax of the book was not until about the last chapter. I would not reccomend this book to other people. I do not think it was as good a book as everyone thinks it is. I hope you support my opion and do not read this book."
5,Excellent book.,"I ordered this book used, expecting a little wear and tear like they had noted, but when I received it, I was stunned by its excellent condition. This book is probably one of the best I've ever read. I originally read it for school, and fell in love with it. Karen Hesse really has a great way of writing. It's simple, yet profound and captivating. Towards the end, I was crying and flipping the pages like crazy. It's an excellent book, and I most definitely suggest it. It makes a great quick read that anybody will love!"
4,Phoenix Rising for English as a Foreign Language,"This is a very fine book and perfect for my purpose. I will be reading Phoenix Rising with a group of 15 and 16-year old prep school international students in a high-beginner/low-intermediate class. After an exhaustive search for a novel that I was not using in the more advanced EFL classes and for one that would appeal to and be at an appropriate reading level for the students in the group, I chose Hesse's. Interestingly, there are some Russian students in the group, so discussions of Chernobyl will certainly arise."
4,"MY SCENE, BABY!","My scene rocks, but it didn't rock my socks until I saw this dudette! This doll, is beautiful, fun, and totally richus! Rock on with yo bad self, my scene!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,This doll looks dead,"What was Mattel thinking. This doll looks uglier then ugly. Her lips look like they are swolen to nothing. Bratz are better anyways. And big deal if they have big heads, feet and lips. It's better to have big heads, lips, and feet better then small. This doll is ugly. and what is with the polka dotted bikini. Polka dots were out years ago. This doll is ugly and Bratz dolls are beautiful. Bratz are better."
1,WOW,"what are they trying to do to Barbie???! it looks like she's done some drugs recently. it creeps me out, man.! barbie has always been beautiful. what is this doll called again?? oyeah, ""drug! it Barbie"". what a JOKE. this barbie will encourage girls to do some..uh..DRUGS!"

3,Equal to the first,"If the reader manages to get through the first book and is still interested in the exploits of Sari, Potatoes, Beshur, and the Puritans of the Righteous States of America, then there are things to enjoy. Sari has to deal with the idiocies of her two ""protectors"", while the secret insanities of the Puritans and the court of the Three Kingdoms become more evident.Baudino's writing is as twisty and turny as ever, with its mass of multiple narrators and styles. For me, the sections that dealt with ""the author"" were the most entertaining because they were the some of the only things that made actual sense!This series can be a real test of patience; but there are some interesting developments."
1,Continuing awfulness,"I thought the series would get better as it went on, perhaps the first book was just a warm up. But no. This drivel is just as bad as the first one. Incoherent, annoying, and hard to read. Is this a script? Is it a book? Who is saying what when? I think I'll go read the masterpiece that is Crossroads of Twilight by Robert Jordan. Thats how bad this book is."
3,A step down from Humanity,"Prince Lincoln Thompson is well known amongst roots reggae fans for his debut album Humanity. It's a classic blend of 70's reggae, funk and disco infused beats with Lincoln's signature falsetto voice. Natural Wild, his follow up to Humanity isn't nearly as memorable. Here, Lincoln teams up with Joe Jackson and his band instead of working with seasoned reggae musicians, a controversial decision at the time. I'm a fan of Jackson's early recordings, but this album sounds too Joe Jackson and not enough Prince Lincoln for me. Jackson's sound is too polished, the arrangements are bland and the songs are average. The dub arrangements are better, but go with Humanity or True Experience (which was very difficult to get until recently re-issued) to get a better representation of Prince Lincoln's sound. Two and 1/2 stars."
3,Problem printing if you run Windows 95 or 98,"I have this CD-ROM and it definitely has comprehensive plant/plant culture information. Please note however, the software was written to run on Win 3.1. If you are using anything more recent such as Windows 95 or 98, you may experience problems printing from the Garden Notebook. Unfortunately at this time, Sunset does not have any plans to update or provide a fix for this problem. Bottom line: the search/browse features on the CD-ROM are great, however you may have problems printing a hard copy to take with you to the nursery when you go shopping."
2,Disappointed in the software version of my favorite book.,"As a proffessional gardener I was very disappointed by the interactive version of the book which I use many times a day. I purchased the software so that i could use the search function based on the zone system. However, if I for example select zone one as a parameter I still get hundreds of results that fit in other zones. When I contacted the company they told me some story about these plants being useful indoors. Essentially the disk is a computer book with a virtually useless zone based search feature. If they ever improve on the software it will be the best one out there."
2,Disappointed in flexibility (i.e. None),"This is for the novice gardener. I was disappointed because I wanted to use it to notebook and journal about plants (both indoors and out) that I have and additions I purchase. Unfortunately, if the plant you have is not in the database, you will not be able to add it to your notebook. Flexibility is nill. Also, it wants you to use 256 colors.I have not tested the print function, because it is pretty worthless to me at this point. If anyone wants to purchase it from me, don't hesitate to write me."
5,Western Garden CD/ Rom,Fast Dlevery & fast Respones On Return Cant Use It. Its For Windows 98 And i Have Vista You Can Trust This Vender JOHN
1,Software way too old!,"I ordered this software with high hopes. The first disk they sent me was for a Mac when I ordered the PC version. They did send me the PC version but it's so old it would barely run on an early XP machine. It, of course, would not even load on my Vista or Windows 7 machine. I do believe trying to sell software this old does a severe disservice to the customer."
4,Helpful for selecting plants.,"The CD helped me find drought-tolerant, deer resistant plants for my area. One has to read the selections carefully, not all finds were drought-tolerant. The diary section had a lock on it so I was unable to utilize that feature."
3,Buyers Beware,"There is not much write up about this item. However, I should let you know that while this product allows you to skip to the next track using the provided keypad, it doesn't allow you to forward the song by a certain few seconds to reach to distinct parts of the same track. This can be quite unbecoming for those who listen to audiobooks on their phones. Please ""READ"" more or ask for a demo before actually purchasing from another outlet. And oh lest I forget, if you are using FM radio and have preset radio stations (who doesn't) you cannot skip to the next preset radio station without actually fiddling with your phone. The keypad alone doesn't suffice for the radio listener's need.Sony Ericsson rules anyway, what else."
2,The left earphone plug falls easily.,"The left earphone plug falls easily. I could never jog with it. Even if I am just walking, I have to adjust it frequently so that it would not drop off."
4,Best female artist of the British Invasion,"Who else but Pet Clark could sing such great songs such as:Downtown; I Know A Place; My Love; A Sign Of The Times;This Is My Song; (and my personal favorite) Don't SleepIn The Subway. This is a great anthology from a talentedsinger! There's so many greatest hits packages out there,but this is the one to buy!!"
5,great,"This is such a great doll!!!!she is so pretty i love my Madison she really is a role model the my scene girls teach friendship,loyalty,and not to be jealouse of others this is a really great buy"
5,wowzer madison rox!,"ok im 13 i love my scene dolls and bratz dolls its so cute how little girls think myscene copied bratz! because even if they did bratz has big competition...bratz dress like hoochies and prostitutes at the age of 14,they also go to clubs and such.. in the way they act myscene teaches younger girls about other things than clubs being prostitutes or dressing the part. i my self love the bratz but face it bratz fans it true they are dressing and acting this way...and its sad how younger girls like this! well i haveto say i do too but change there clothes ...geez... make bratz beach ones or ssomething instead of club ones and stuff its getting ANNYOING. so bratz fans read this a couple times and stop saying myscene copied them because myscnes do NOT DRESS LIKE HOOCHIES AT THE AGE OF 15-17 OK AND THEY DO NOT GO TO CLUBS. so yah....BRATZ STILL ROCK BUT TAKE A LOOK AT THEM!"
1,I hate My Scene dolls,"My Scene dolls are really ugly. And she has ugly hair and clothes. I hate My Scene dolls, they look so ugly. Bratz dolls are better then My Scene dolls. And Bratz dolls have better clothes, and they are a lot prettier. And they have a lot of cool accesories, and the My Scene dolls have cheap accesories. My Scene dolls are terribly ugly. I hate My Scene dolls so much, they should all be thrown away. My Scene doll are the ugliest dolls on the face of the earth. But Bratz dolls are the prettiest dolls on the face of the earth. I am never going to get this ugly doll. Everyone of those dolls should be thrown away because they are so ugly. I hate My Scene dolls, and I always will. And I love Bratz dolls and I always will."
3,Not what I expected,"It was a bit more childish, written for a younger audience, than I thought it would be. But my dyslexic son had an easier time reading this than the one in school. He understood the story. Having the large spaced out typeface made it easier for him to keep his position on the page. It would appear that this came out of a library and it was in surprisingly good condition."
1,Big Disapointment!,"This was a massive disapointment, too much talking from luke and his boyz and not enough of the girls. Dont waste your money!!"
5,american sound at its best,I found the new piece written by Mark O'Connor to be a wonderful sound that stirred the American Pride in me. I also found the pieces arranged by Alice Parker to be sung with excitement and accuracy- qualities lacking in most choral groups todayI highly recommend this recording.
1,"Just bad luck, maybe.","I got my treo 600 as an upgrade thru cingular online. After couple of days of using it, I noticed that the wireless mode keep on turning off by itself ocassionally. Tried to call cingular customer service, most of their tech support is not even familiar with treo 600, I got transferred around waiting 10-15 minutes each time i transferred, with the machine telling me that my call is important to them. I keep on wondering, if my call was important to them, why am I on hold for more than 30 minutes. Anyway, I ended up returning the unit. It's possible that I got a lemon, but I'm not willing to give it a second chance."
1,Don't buy this phone with such a bad history!,"I bought this phone without doing the research I usually do because I've owned a Palm PDA for years. Turns out this phone and the 650 are part of a class action lawsuit because of the problems the phone has had.In my case, I used a headphone from Radio Shack, and immediately the headset speaker on the phone stopped working. A hard reset and search on Google, revealed loads of reports on this issue.I went to the Palm site to the support center, and found absolutely ....nothing about this issue. Which tells me Palm doesn't want to deal with it and validates the reports on the Treo usergroup sites about bad customer service.Palm has lost another customer; I certainly won't risk my money on the 700!"
1,Run ...from this no - service company,"I have owned this unlocked GSM 600 phone for 3 agonizing years. Not sure whether to lynch the engineers, techs or marketers!!! Lots of potential and promises and absolutely horrible customer care. Treo and PalmOne really sucks and is pushing otherwise dedicated customers to other smart phones. Blackberry does less but more reliably. So long you silver piece of _____, I am tired of dropped calls, shut offs and resets. JGK"
2,"Great gadget, phone terrible","This would be the neatest, coolest, handiest thing in the world if the phone worked well. The problem is extremely loud buzzing makes phone almost unusable. I finally was able to exchange it for another, which is starting to have the same problem. Seems like these phones have a life span of several months before the buzzing starts, and then it's all over. Other than that, it is a great device that works well all over the world."
4,Good CD,"Hard, edgy vocals. Nice variety of tracks between rock and ballads. Good example of Italian pop music."
3,Irene Grandi - a good singer.,"This is a good work of Irene but when you are linsten the songs you the first time enjoy yourself, the second time make a bit more attention to the text, the third time you fall completly in depression. The text of the songs are a milkshake of word: absolutely nosense. Ah, well, the music is good instead. I read an other review... this is NOT ABSOLUTELY AN EXAMPLE OF GOOD ITALIAN ROCK OR BALLADS... if you are looking for that search Luciano Ligabue, this is a good artist (and the song has a real text)"
1,"Compared to The Eight, this is A One","I'm a big fan of The Eight and I was looking forward to more of the same. But, instead of a complex sweeping novel with plot twists and intellectual interest, I found this to be a formula piece that felt dashed off. I was very disappointed."
1,Unrealistic and foolish.,"A poorly written, and unrealistic tale about the banking industry. I have worked in banking for 15 years, and never once met a character anything like the persons described in this book. I eventually had to put the book down."
1,Huge Disappointment,The Eight is a favorite of mine so I was really looking forward to her next work. It felt like she had to meet a deadline and rushed thru this without doing the research that made The Eight such an enjoyable read. A Calculated Risk is a forgettable caper story.
1,"Filled with ludicrous details, wooden characters, and turgid","If Neville's been in banking, I have to wonder whether she ever saw a computer. Natural language interfaces like the ones she describes simply don't exist, and 20-year-old computers aren't treasures -- they're junk; your toaster can compute faster than they can. Such errors (not to mention errors in her descriptions of the Chips and Fedwire wire-transfer systems) make me doubt that the rest of the book has any details right. So this is all just science fiction, and if you're gonna write science fiction, you can make it a lot more interesting than this.Even so, this might be a decent excuse for an ""airplane book"" if the prose were any less wooden. I read passages aloud that made my wife guffaw. At first I thought I was reading a Bulwer-Lytton award winner. Don't spend your money on this tripe! You're better off spending the time watching reruns of The Brady Bunch."
2,BORING,I have read both this book and the eight. I loved the eight but could not finish calculated risk. It was chock full of boring details.Never ending
2,Calculated Risk,Disappointed loved The Eight hated the third book she wrote. It was if she was trying hard to come up with something great but missed. Knew her subject that wasn't the problem. The Eight she crafted it well because she loved it this I feel was to fulfill a contract.
3,"Not like ""The Eight""","An interesting story about banks' technological insecurity. Neville does have a profound knowledge about the banks' standard of living. I wonder if Neville ever worked at a bank. However, I believe ""The Eight"" is pretty more interesting in its characters and story. I learned a lot about the French Revolution in the ""Eight""."
2,The last one,"Definitely the last book of Katherine Neville, first of all let me tell you that if you decide to read this book, the story that is written in the beginning of every part of the years 1800, just skip it, don't worth it your time.The second point that is at the very beginning of the book is that when you are going to find a new job, please don't tell me that your future boss will call to your actual job to ask about you, is obvious that your actual boos won't say anything good about you.The third point is that the book has nothing, two people are trying to rob a bank using the computers and some hackers, but definitely Katherine didn't know how to write it or how to explain it, I put two stars because my mind didn't let me put just one."
3,An interesting primer for the financially inclined,"This is a good introduction for anyone who doesn't know too much about the world of high finance. Neville explains her plot in clear, unambiguous prose.Would, however, that she could flesh out her characters the way she does her banking terminology. They are all cardboard cutouts, to one degree or another - some of them have a little more personality than others, but it seems that Neville has been working in those cold heartless banks just a little too long.The three-star rating is for her explanations of financial terms and transactions; her previous book (""The Eight"") was far better."
3,This is more of a historical novel than you might suspect!,"The first book I read by the author was The Eight, which I thought was terrific. The biggest problem I had with this one is how dated it's gotten...some of the background needed for the plot to work just hasn't held up over time. If you can suspend your judgment on that it's not a bad read. But if you've read The Eight, you're likely to be disappointed."
2,Calculated Risk,"After reading The Eight, I was excited about reading another novel by the author. Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed. The characters could be in a romance novel, the story line was predictable and the plot did not keep me in suspense at all. When I read a good book, I am always sad when I reach the end of the story- I was happy to get to the end of this one!"
5,PAGE-TURNING DELIGHT,"This is the most entertaining and upbeat book I have read in a long, long time. I find a lot of fiction inane and boring, boring, boring. But A Calculated Risk was the kind of page-turner that keeps this guy up late at night! Tons of fascinating detail about the world of high finance."
5,Good book and not out of print,This book is an intriguing and well researched suspense thriller. It can be purchased at any bookstore.
3,Like this? Read THE EIGHT!,"Good read -- lots of finance, high tech. If you liked this, please do yourself a huge favor and read Ms. Neville's first novel, THE EIGHT. You will not regret it"
4,"Financial, high-tech, thriller. mystery.","An exciting read. High technology, high finance, high suspense. This is an intellegent book, complex and exciting. I can't wait to read Katherine's next work"
5,To Read Together,This has proven to be a wonderful way to start our day! One or the other will read it aloud and the insights have been great and we really like the writers. I purchased one for my daughter and her husband and they are enjoying it as well. This is my first Daily Word book and I am going to look for one just for women.
1,i am outraged,Monkey on a String is the horriblest movie ever. As a memeber of Peta I find puting monkies on strings to be irresponsible behavior. Monkies do not belong on strings. I think we should all band together to stop the mistreatment of the noble monkey.
1,Disapppointed,"I was excited waiting for this video in my mailbox. Watching it I fell asleep. Although biographical details and a survey of their contributions is important, it was too long and this documentary did not focus on their greatness: their home and the chairs they designed. That Charles Eames personally did not want to be known as a chair designer is not enough reason to divert from the the great contributions of their studio team. Moreover, the individuals that spoke about their personal and professional engagement with the Eames, were very uninteresting and pedestrian. I am sorry I spend my money on this unilluminating video for the initiated and unfocused presentation for the uniniated. It's not a video that would get anyone interested in the Eames's work."
3,"Typos, typos, and more typos!","Owning the first edition of Duffy's work, I could not wait to see the believed-to-be improved second edition. While some new information exists, there are so many typographical errors permeating the text, that the shoddy work by this publisher substantially distracts the reader from Duffy's prose. What's more, the publisher/editor of this second edition omitted from the listing/battle histories one of the Prussian regiments that was detailed in the original edition. Duffy is a fine historian, but it is too bad that the publisher's efforts were not up to the same standards. In conclusion, I will continue to use the original edition in favor of this second edition."
5,A book that made me understand color correction on a Mac.,This book teaches you how to color correct an image using familiar elements within the image and the eyedropper and levels PhotoShop tools. You can actually correct an image on a black and white monitor after studying this book.
4,High brow comedy,"The female version of Victor Borge. B.J. Ward's excellent voice along with witty, truthful and hilarious observations about operas, opera singers and composers is a delight. Lovers of classical music will love to play this album for friends."
3,Expensive,"The title states ""Implementing,Managing, and Maintaining a Microsoft Windows Server 2003 Network Infrastructure: Exam 70-291"" but the front cover depicts Exam 70-293. Which one? There is also no look inside book feature, so I can't tell what it is about from table of contents."
3,well...,"this album is a nice blast of melodic death ala in flames, dark tranquillity, except much faster. but that is where the problem lies. i love insane double bass, flying solos and all, but when the drummer uses the same snare beat in almost EVERY song with the same tempo, it gets really annoying and old fast. the drummer is good no doubt, but he REALLY needs to vary it up. that is what gave this album 3 stars for me...but that is only my opinion. if you like these guys, try enforsaken, arsis, and capharnaum...or if u like those guys, try the Forsaken. vocals and guitars are great here, the drumming does have a bit of varation in some parts, and the 5 bonus tracks are killer, but really, i hope thier drummer can get some creativity next album."
1,Dissapointing,"I read lots of good reviews on this band, so I thought I'd give them a listen. Lots of death metal fans seemed to like this band, so I thought I would as well. I was mistaken. I sampled a song from their previous album, and really liked it. So, I purchased Traces of the Past. This album is extremely repetetive. It has almost no flow to it at all. The cover songs are okay, but the rest of the album is garbage. It's what I like to call the ""banging on drums sound"". As in nothing creative or good sounding, just a bunch of repetative banging on the drums, as if they're a punk band or something. If you like mainstream ""metal"", such as Killswitch Engage and Shadowsfall, then get this album. If your like me, and you like bands like Cradle of Filth, Amon Amarh, Kreator, or (old)Arch Enemy, then stay clear of this one. The Forsaken's earlier albums might be worth checking out though."
4,know yourself!,"Rebeccasreads recommends CLIMB EVERY OBSTACLE as a ""non-denominational"" book of 101 opportunities from Anger to Worry, to ponder on. Comes with quotations from both past & present well-known thinkers, writers, poets & such plus a few from old Anonymous.What Anita Jefferson has to teach is simply understood & easily processed. It will bring comfort & insight to just about anyone, especially when faced with troubling attitudes, seemingly insurmountable problems or mind-numbing dead-ends -- either from within or from outside.While it is in need of proofreading, that doesn't detract from its content."
3,Read only end of book.,"The first half of this book is somewhat of a dry and lackluster catalogue of Mr. Sire's memoires of his seminars. The information presented though is neither clarified nor evaluated. Much of this book has been written before in his other books, particularly his Universe Next Door - which I highly recommend. I felt as though much of this book was simply rehashed, and added no further weight or evidence.To be fair, beginning with his chapter on Evil, this book took a positive turn and now began to address with zeal and clarity some of life's most pondered issues. In his last chapters you will find evidence for a necessary God. I would buy this book and skip to the end..."
2,Don't buy this,So I bought this for my mother for Christmas thinking it would be the perfect stocking stuffer but I was wrong it looks cheap I know for the price what could I expect. It left my hands smelling like metal. I am very disappointed and I wont be buying any of this bracelets any more :(
3,Satisfied,"The bracelet was beautiful when I got it and I loved the note about mothers on the inside. However, it turned rather quickly due to it not being real silver. I've never worn it in water or anything it just turned rather fast for my liking."
5,Beautiful and fast shipping,I bought this for Christmas. It's very beautiful I love it. It took 3 days to get here very fast shipping. The price is perfect. The box it came in is so cute and the poem is great. I would suggest this to anyone it's the perfect gift.
4,Great bracelet for the price,"I purchased this bracelet for my mother and found the quality to be very nice for the price. Unlike some of the other reviews, the one I received was made of heavier materials, the charms metal and looked exactly like the picture. It has a unique latch that might not be real easy to figure out for some but I didn't have any problem with it. I am impressed and my mother loved her gift."
5,My mom loved this!!,My mom loved this!! I got it for her on mothers day. I just purchased this item on the 8th of may and it was already shipped to my moms house on the 11th. i wasn't expecting it to be shipped so soon. i received a call from my mother crying with joy (keep in mind shes not a very sentimental person and very hard to shop for)... She described this as it came in a very beautiful box and the poem inside the box was what made her cry lol. She asked how much i had payed for it and when i told her she was expecting it to be more because of how well made the bracelet is and the quality of everything in general. It was definitely worth the money! I would recommended this a gift for all the mothers!
1,Never,I was supposed to get this for my mom on mothersday but it never came and I never got the money back either
4,Bought it 4 mom its ok,But not as fancy in real life if moms wrist is not 2small dont buy it cause it be tight .. its cute but something yur 5year old can make . Non the less its an ok gift to give but not a wow gift...cant go wrong if dont have much to spend on a gift then get it
3,Ok book but not all true,"Just a short review of the book : while I did like the book and it was a fast read, I had trouble with some of the stuff being said. For one thing White comes across as not liking C.S. Lewis. I just couldn't understand where some of his facts were coming from. He makes crazy things up and I could tell that he has never researched the man and therefore should not be making comments on Lewis or his wife. I guess that was one of my biggest gripes. If you don't really know much about Tolkien or Lewis then go a head and read it. I'm now buying Carpenters book to get the real story. It's a shame that anyone can cash in on someone."
4,interesting,"I thought the book, being short, was well done. I'm not a tolkien, the man, fan, myself, I just like the books he wrote. It was short enough to keep me interested and didn't go into tolkien worship. He was a man just like any of us. White didn't go into intense depth like some of the other authors, who border on tolkien worship. This book is for those who want to skim his life, his associations, like C.S. Lewis, his wife, etc., to see who he really is really quickly and go on. The few supposed 'errors' as some other reviewers put it, are completely outweighed by the many facts put forth by the author that paint the picture as it is done in other works, but at 30,000 feet. Like I said before if you want more depth and concise tolkien history go to some other book."
4,Skye Rockets,"I'm a major Tolkien fan, thanks to my dad, and I thought reading this book would be a great way to learn more about Tolkien's life and what influenced his writing and ideas. It started off as a great read, until I got to the end of page 86, where it suddenly skipped to page 119!!!!!!!!!!! The middle of chapter five turns into the middle of chapter 7. I bought the book at a Borders bookstore in Michigan and I have already gone back and placed an ordered for another copy, but I am hoping other copies are not missing pages. I did enjoy reading this book because the author delves deep into Tolkien's life to give the reader all aspects. I recommend this book to any Tolkien fan. Hopefully, I will get another copy soon!!"
4,amusing,"I remember several silly scenes, like when Bob Cummings' phone lands in the fish tank and he thinks he's just plain old hearing voices. Then, of course, there's the vest under the shirt and taxi cabs with electric razors.The romance doesn't hurt the story in the least. You always know who's going to wind up together, but ""getting there is half the fun."" :-)Got some time? Need a laugh? Trying to relax? Like either of the main stars? Etc., etc. Fits a lot of molds, if you ask me. Enjoy!"
1,The quality of the picture is so bad it renders it unwatchable.,"The quality of the video and sound make this great movie unwatachable, hopefully there is a better copy out there.This is not up to the regular Amazon standards.David W Wright"
2,Track Listing,"This CD has the same songs as most of the other early years releases ie. ""Beginnings"", ""On The Way"" and ""Final Beginnings"" , tracks listing is:01 For The Love Of Him02 Bite My Lip03 Wild And Wicked04 Send It With Love05 (Don't Give Me That) Once Over06 Hate To Love07 LUV Eyes08 I Lost My Heart When I Found You09 Rhythm Made Me Do It10 Two Hearts One Love11 Half Breed12 For The Love Of Him (Dance Mix)The only different track listing that I've noticed is on ""Send It With Love"" which has 18 songs instead of the 10-12 on the other CD's.Nothing like her country music it's more 80's pop (and not the greatest of that either), but if you're a Shania fan you might want it just to add to your collection."
3,Tournament Tactics,"The title of this book is misleading. It talks more about baits and how to rig them than it talks about strategies. I wanted more information about what strategies to use for fishing tournaments. The booked explained flipping and pitching, spinnerbaits, etc but did not talk about how to spend your time in a tournament. I feel the book was nice to read but did not help answer any question on strategies."
3,The Book Title is a Misnomer,"In this book, Brauer doesn't really talk about his tournament strategy. He mainly talks about how he fishes various lures and why he chooses those lures and how he uses them on different types of cover and structure. It is an easy read but if you consider yourself to be an advanced bass fisherman, don't bother with this book."
1,Goood family dvd Rainbow Brite,the dvd was good viewing for the whole family. Brought back alot of childhood memories.
2,"OK, but could be better","The DVD is called Rainbow Brite Special Collector's Edition. This is very misleading....yes all the episodes are on two discs, but the quality was not that greatest. The audio sounds like it was recorded off an old VHS where is sometimes cracks and squeaks in the audio part. Also the song for the ending credits is not what I remember listening to as a little child...matter of fact I have the first two episodes recorded on VHS from the early 80's and it sounds a lot better than what I got. All in all it seems like this was originally recorded onto VHS from airing on TV and then recorded onto DVD, with the title ""Special Collector's Edition""."
3,I'm glad there is a DVD out even if it is poorly made,"This DVD was poorly made, the menus and stuff were beautiful, but the episodes just didn't have that ""retroness"" to them, as in the picture quality seemed kind of dimmed down. I have some episodes on a DVD that had better picture quality that kept its ""retroness"". The DVD would freeze up in some parts, but other than that it did play great. The audio could have been better too. I had to turn the volume way up in order to listen to it.However, this DVD will last me until there is an official release of the whole series."
1,Worst buy ever!,"Problems, problems, problems!!! First it came late then the first dvd wouldn't even play! The second dvd played somewhat better but froze on it's own every once in awhile and would freeze when I tried to go back or move ahead. This was an overpriced rip off!"
2,Disappointed,"I received this in the mail about a week ago. I thought this might not have been an official release. The song used in the DVD isn't the original to the cartoon. My mom would tape then for me while I was at school in kindergarten. I still have three episodes from when she taped them. The original song for the credits started out with ""Rainbow Brite see the shining light...."" The picture was okay, but the sound wasn't all that good. It sounded like the track on a VHS tape when you first start playing a recording back and the VCR hasn't adjusted the tape yet. I don't know if that explains it correctly. I was soooooo excited when I saw this, because I've been waiting for this to come out, but was disappointed after watching the episodes. I will definitely be buying the official release for Rainbow Brite. I hope they model the official DVD to the He-Man and She-Ra DVD's."
2,What a disappointment,"Rainbow Brite Special Collector's EditionASIN:B000GNVPZ0Just got the Set and was all excited to watch the show again.Sorry to say that the color quality is not that great and sometimes even horrible.I also was very disappointed that the opening of the individual episodes do not have the original song(Rainbow Brite, see the shining light)anymore. It has been replaced with some intodruction spoken by a very unpleasant male voice with music playing from the Rainbow Brite Movie (Rainbow Brite and Me)in the background.This song also plays at the end credits.The original Theme Song was just a big part of the whole show.Another thing which is really annoying is the sound.It is so low that I have to set the volume on my TV extremely high to understand everything.I'm not sure if I will keep the Set.I'm so disappointed."
5,Just got mine TODAY!,So...I finally got my Rainbow Brite DVD in the mail today. I must say that the presentation and layout is nice. The set comes with 2 DVD which contains all 13 episodes for the show. Definitely a good buy at under $30.
4,Rainbow Brite,"This video is awesome. There were a very few audio problems and it froze for a second at the beginning of 2 sections, but other than that it's a great buy! The picture is wonderful and besides those few issues everything is great. The kids will love it and those of us who grew up watching Rainbow Brite will love what they've done with it. Definiately worth all of my money and then some."
2,Bland,"My friends and I (all over 21, for reference) sat down to play this one day and we just could not find this game interesting or fun or amusing in the least. I'm not sure what is needed to make this fun or challenging... but none of us could make it past 15 minutes of play. It will not be brought out again."
2,Defective game,"We played for the first time last night. While it was fun we had 2 issues. First, not sure they have all the facts correct. But that's ok as it led to some discussions and we just moved on. But on the Rush Hour questions every card had Crap as the answer for every question. We looked thru them all and everyone was that way. That made using them useless. So while it could be fun, we'd have to give the game a thumbs down and put it in the back of the shelf."
5,Lot's of fun!,"I bought this game for my nephew for christmas. It kept 8 of us (6 adults and 2 children) amused for hours. In answering the questions, we also learned a lot - particularly when we answered incorrectly! Enjoy."
2,goes from very fun to boring in 20 mintues flat...,"I got this game well over a year ago played it 3 times I believe. The first time I played it I was having a really good time, then it just got boring, the even more boring. Then the other 2 times I played I just didn't enjoy it at all. There isn't too much to this game, just questions really, and well over 50% of the questions the average person wouldn't know off hand."
3,The Fact isn't always a fact,"We enjoy playing this game, but wanted to inform all that we did find a statement labeled as FACT, but it isn't. Makes you wonder how many others are incorrect.It would be nice if the CRAP statement were followed by an explanation of what might have made it fact."
3,False Facts,"This game has false ""facts"" in which the game states are true. My Husband (who was born & raised in Finland, actually next to the city of Nokia) was laughing hysterically when the game used as a fact that the word Nokia means a small fury animal/weasel. I'm not sure where the company that made this game got it's facts from, but Nokia doesn't actually mean anything since it's the name of a city (The city does however have a coat of arms with a weasel in it...Maybe it got it's info from there?). Anyways, I only bring this up since if you're looking for an educational game that actually has true facts in it, look elsewhere since you can't really trust this game.Other then that though, it is fun to play."
1,"Truly crap, that is a fact.","I received this game for Christmas. My family loves games and plays games like Apples to Apples and Catch Phrase. We were looking for a new game and this was NOT it. There is nothing to this game but guessing as most of the questions you have no idea what the answers are. Save your money, do not buy."
2,Didn't live up to expectation,"The description of the game made me want to have it. After playing it, the novelity wore off quickly. Not much skill to slap down a card and guess. If you play with a number of people the chips run out fast."
2,not worth it,"boring - a one note game. this could have been a card game - i thought it would be more involved. when you guess something correctly, you get a token and once the tokens are gone, you count them up and whoever has the most wins. the only twist is a kind of lightning round, but it's not enough to keep it interesting. the questions are cute, but the novelty wears off sooner than later.Balderdash is more fun...sitting around without a game and talking is more fun."
2,Entrevistas: An Introduction to Language and Culture (2nd Edition),"This book is for junior high school students, not college students. This book lacks the content needed to really learn Spanish proficiently. This book was required by our Spanish instructor and I am not a bit impressed with it."
1,The authors think too much of themselves,"I attend a school where one of the author's works. I have yet to hear of one student who thinks this is a good text book, and my teacher for the second semester (of 4 total required) even (rather subtly and carefully) indicated she was not impressed. The concept is solid, but there are many errors/typos in the text and workbook - a crime for trying to use it when you're learning a subject in which precise translation is vitale. Also, the book offers many activities, but unless your teacher goes over the answers there's little point in doing them since there's no answer key to check how you did! The workbooks are a little better, with answer keys whenever possible, but I ended up buying five supplementary books, including books on grammar, verb usage and conjugation and practical application exercises.A textbook for college shouldn't require so many additional purchases just to figure out what you're suppose to be learning."
4,We're reading Harry Potter!,"I beg to differ in response to another who commented that this book will not be added to any curriculum soon. Next semester, advanced Greek students at my college will be doing a Harry Potter reading club once a week. One student will be taking it as a class, while everyone else (of high enough skill) is welcome to join to have some fun. Sadly, I just graduated and can't participate... but I'm thinking of keeping up and coming when I can. The tough decision is, should I keep reading Homer or take a break for some Harry Potter...? I'm definately going for the Latin version though!"
1,Don't bother!,"While this game has a cute idea of a tug of war between adult and kid players, it has questions that no child of 8 would be knowledgeable about. The age level should be 12 and up. If you're looking for a game to play with adults and children, may I suggest Brain Quest. It gives your child a chance to succeed by showing what they really know with questions based on a child's grade in school. You certainly won't find that in Kids Battle the Grown-ups."
4,We laughed so hard we almost cried,"I disagree with the other review that I read. My son and husband and I played Kids vs. Adults with another family and we were laughing out loud. We had so much fun, we bought the game ourselves. We did not find the questions too hard and we all learned a few things. Good game!"
2,Disappointing,"Kids got bored with the game because the questions were impossible for them to answer, and the tug-of-war was just plain silly."
4,The CLASSIC Beginning wizard's Tarot,"As a student of wizardry, this is my first deck, which is particularly handy for later reference. The ""Lovers"" card here is not an Adam and Eve scene, and this tarot ditches all the biblical crap you come across these days, leaving pure French patriotism. The Magician card here may not look as good as he does in ""The Vampire"" Tarot or ""Robin Wood Tarot"", but the pope card is perfect( I am not a Christian, so I find this card annoying), while the High Priestess is absolutely lovely, and the ""Death"" card may cause mirth or fear, depending on your personality .Based on medieval woodcarvings, this is a great beginning Tarot deck for ALL students of witchcraft and wizardry."
2,details,"I wish the book that game with the cards had more explanations, for example, I had to research some of the photos on the cards,I wished I had just bought an older deck with a better book. The quality was a bit like Wal-mart brands."
3,Fairly decent reproduction,"This is a reproduction deck based on the original French deck. The book won't offer much info in the manner of learning tarot, so I would advise finding a book to go along with it. The cards are standard, well constructed and look very nice."
1,not any good,"I bought one of these drives 3 months ago. It has overheated as long as I have had it even if it isn't being used - if it's in the drive it gets hot. It actually got so hot that the plastic melted on it(this happened in the course of 20 minutes!).It also wasn't always recognized when plugged in. Pretty much at random some computers wouldnt recognize it, and finally a few days ago it began to give disk read errors and failing to copy files.I sent it back and I hope to get a refund but i'll probably just get a replacement.It sounds like a good price, but I advise you not to get this drive."
1,Disapointed!,"It get's the job done. I purchased this because it was a Brown & Sharp and expected the same quality as my other Brown & Sharp tools. I have a China made one that is better than the finish on this thing, NO MORE Brown and Sharp for me!"
5,Good Christian Read for my 8 year old,"My daughter picked up Ellie while on a vacation in Amish country. We are now on our third book in the series and she is ""hooked"". She loves to imagine what is like to be living in such a different culture, and yet so near where we live. Better yet, this series provides a good story line, good information about the Amish, respectful of their way of life, with a Christian perspective that keeps the stories uplifting and positive, but not prissy.This first book is about Ellie's growing up years (brief as they seem to be) and her experiences with her ""Englisher"" friend at the local elementary school. It is very well done and interesting, with a vocabulary that my daughter enjoys.We heartily recommend this book."
1,The first two pages are okay?,"This book is a good read if you are in the mood for something light, easy to read, and POINTLESS! It is a simple book, with not much detail, elaboration, or as previously mentioned PLOT! It is interesting to read about the amish, but that is about the only interesting thing about it!..."
3,A bit disappointed - but still a fair read,"I did not get the sense that Ethan Sawyer was this strong, no nonsense type of hero. I found the story boring at times and couldn't wait to get through it. I didn't care for the ending either which I won't give away."
4,As good as the first one..,"I enjoy listening to the first ""Lazy Dog"" 2-Disc compilation, this one is just as good. It is full of very energetic beats and is expertly assembled by Watt and Hannan"
1,Not happy,It is a very lovely DVD. But I can't watch it in Belgium!They could have shown on this site that they only sold DVDs for American DVD-players exclusively!Now I'm stuck with a beautiful DVD that I can't even watch and for which I probably will have to pay again 5O euros for shipping to sell it in America because nobody will ever buy it here!I'm very disappointed in Amazon and I will not buy anything again from this site.
4,Nice Story,"This is basically the Shakespeare story with a Japanese twist of being in space. The Montagues and Capulets are still there, but with a bit more ferocity in their feuding. The Capulets are all but wiped out and Juliet's true identity has been hidden from her for her own safety. Originally this series was sold as 2 different sets, the first being Juliet and the second being Romeo. This S.A.V.E. edition inculdes both sets in 1 pack."
3,Good but not constant,"The first 9-10 episodes are incredible but as soon as the love story begin, some characteres loose what make them cool to watch. The ending was well handle but some people may loose interest between episode 13 and say 21 maybe. It still worth my time but was not as great as it could have been. I would have put 3 1/2 if that would have been possible here"
4,"Modern, Fun, Practical","For the price, this set was all I needed and was not too babyish. I wanted something that could be incorporated with the rest of the house and this was it. It can grow with her and I won't feel rushed to change the style of her room. Good Quality, nice colors, although slightly more purpley than the pic."
5,Crib Bedding Set -High Quality,The quality of this set is high as all items are very well made. Very pleased with purchase.
2,Good Reference - but very dated,"Pintoff has put together a very good reference of film schools and film programs around the nationUnfortunately, it is now over 10 years old, and while many of the programs the book lists are still in existance, much of the info or data about them is too dated to be correct/relevant todayMy biggest criticism though would be that the book only lists the various programs and gives contact info ---- other than that, there are no reviews or feedback of the programs(...)Despite the cynical vibe on LOAFS, it nonetheless, lists almost all the film programs available, and its completely free!Happy reading!"
1,No se dejen engañar,"Es un libro de Amortegui, discípulo del falso gurú Victor Manuel Gómez, alias Samael Aun Weor, fundador de la secta gnóstica considerada como muy peligrosa y destructiva.No encontrarán en el libro más que información distorsionada y falsa espiritualidad. Para más información consulten el foro La Gnosis Develada."
2,Not Jumbo!,"These raisins are good, however, they are by no means jumbo. They are as small as they come."
5,"Great Cookbook, Great Resource","I love this book! Not only lots of great recipes, but fabulous background info on kitchen techniques and lots of ""how to's"". I've turned to this book as a reference many times over the years that I've owned it. How wonderful that it is being re-printed! Get a copy if you don't have one already!"
4,Great recipes for the wheat grinder,"I purchased this book because I purchased a home wheat grinder and the recipes that I was using didn't taste the same when I ground my own wheat. This book has MANY EXCELLENT recipes using the whole wheat flour and you don't HAVE to grind it yourself. Only drawback...a lot of use of soy flour and I add meat to the recipes, no meat."
5,"Thorough, informative, and extremely usable!",For new or practicing vegetarians or anyone who wants meatless meals or accompaniments this book has a lot of different but practical and easy recipes that just plain taste GOOD! The book is written in such a way as to feel that the authors are talking to you. I enjoyed just reading through it as much as I did trying the recipes.Balancing Protein Complements is explained in an easy to understand way which really helps in substituting for meat-based protein.
4,Kudos for Overall Excellence in Vegetarianism,"I am NOT exclusively vegetarian but, I do on occasion love a good vegetarian meal. After being disappointed so many times by various books on the subject, I checked this book out through my library system. After giving it a test run I NEEDED it in my personal library.This one is definitely a winner and a keeper! It has a wonderful selection of recipes from hometown to around the world; uses easy to find ingredients and has very informative sections on menu planning and preparation techniques.Great for folks who want to explore this type of cuisine at either an entry or expert level because the authors really made an effort to make the cuisine accessible and palatable for a variety of tastes."
4,good veggie stuff,"we are not vegetarians, but purchased this book as a part of our effort to incorporate more vegetarian meals into our weekly menu. i really appreciate that they mark the recipes with major, minor or protein complement so you can build a nutritionally sound meal that is also satisfying. i also like to short-list of themed menus at the back that makes planning meals easier. not all recipes have been winners, but we have enjoyed several quite a bit and nothing has been inedible. i dropped it from 5 to 4 stars bc the nutritional content of the meals is not provided and thus i have to do a lot of math in order to figure out how much fat/calories are in each dish."
1,I'm giving it away,"I've bought this book years ago because I thought it'd be an encyclopedic reference for my new vegetarian life, but the recipes are awfull, even if I'm not vegetarian anymore I like their yochee book and love the breakfast one, but this is terrible, so I'm giving it away."
5,This is the best cookbook ever even if you are not a vegetarian,"I bet you are like me. You have a shelf of cookbooks but rarely open most of them. You can tell the ones you use by looking at the shape it's in. My American Wholefoods Cuisine cookbook looks like it has been through the mill. I use it constantly--whether I am making homemade mayonnaise, trying my hand at making a delicious soup, or getting advice on whether I can freeze a certain vegetable, etc. It is chock full of the information you need to know and it is written and illustrated so clearly. It is a gem and I wouldn't know what to do without it."
5,A Classic!,"This book is a must-have for the cook who cares about cooking and serving good, healthy food. It's a classic with recipes you will use again and again."
2,A fine example of the decline in furniture quality,"As stated in previous reviews, this cabinet is mostly easy to assemble, with the exception of the corner brackets. Impossible to screw in those corner brackets when the cabinet is assembled. Plus, the screws are very cheap screws that are not wood screws. There is a significant gap between the drawers once assembled. One of the drawers does not slide well and seems to slip off its track occasionally. The color of the cabinet is nice but the finish is not done well. I feel I need to be very careful pulling out the drawers as the cabinet just does not feel very sturdy. If you want a file cabinet that looks pretty, is fairly economical compared to other non-metal file cabinets, and won't be used often, this may still be an acceptable choice."
5,Go Cougs! (& little sports fans everywhere...!),"This is such a cute book... a must have for any Cougar fan's offspring. This is a great way to introduce school spirit to your child, and instill some Cougar Pride in the process."
4,Very handy,"I bought this through Amazon.com because I could not find it at ANY of the local dealers that the manufacturer's site said carried it. I would say a few things about it:1. It's much heavier than I expected2. You CAN pinch your fingers when you're closing it, contrary to the mechanism that ""guarantees"" you can't. Be careful.3. It's a hair flimsy, but supports my 190 lbs. happily.4. The bottom seems like it could have been made with a little softer material, so that it would grip the ground even better. I was pretty nervous using it on a hardwood floor.5. It's a fantastic product and I have already recommended it several times. It was the envy of my coworkers when it showed up at my office!6. I think it's a bit cheap that the carrying case is not included.Now I will spend the rest of my days climbing up and down things in and around my house!"
2,"Not reliable, all parts not available","I have the 15.5 ft, heavy duty model. This ladder started out great. Within 8-10 uses it did not open and close very well. The ladder would not lock properly without effort to make sure each pin was properly seated. My real problem came after about 20 uses when one of the locking mechanisms came apart. The leg will no longer lock at all. The company does not offer a replacement for this part (even though it is easily removed), therefore I am stuck with an almost new ladder that I can't use. I think it would make a good ladder for a homeowner who will not use it often and can be very careful with it. Even though I was extremely careful transporting it I believe that is how it was damaged. I think the locking mechanism was hit during transportation. The design of the thumb lever can be hit easily. The ladder is not designed well enough for medium duty use, only light use."
4,Good but could be better,"I bought this ladder to use on my RV. I liked the telescoping since it takes less room to store. It is fairly easy to open and close if you follow the directions. Ignore the directions (especially when closing) can give you a nasty pinch. The weigh is manageable. But if you are using only a couple of rungs it tends to be a bit top heavy when moving.My only complaint is the top of the ladder. It should have padding for leaning against the wall (whether RV or house) to avoid damage. It has some hard rubber so if you are very, very, careful you should not cause any damage. If it had a 3"" post above the top you could wrap a soft cloth around it to protect against damage. Having said that, if you are looking for a telescoping ladder I would recommend this one."
4,"Works very well, vest adjustments could be improved","I purchased this item to wear under a mascot costume and I've found it works very well, and pretty much counteracts the extra heat caused by wearing a full body covering in thick synthetic fur. It still gets stuffy with my head covered but this vest makes an impressive difference.As other users have mentioned, the velcro adjustments on the sides leave a little to be desired, I'm 5'9"", 150lbs and I needed to double up the velcro leaving some tabs sticking out to get the snug fit the vest requires but it works. I plan on modifying the straps to better fit me."
5,Groovy,"The blue light through the fibers is plenty light in a dark room. Of course I wish there were more fibers, and perhaps there are other lamps available with more, but this one works fine. It is battery operated, and thus it is mobile, which is a good idea if you have kids who like to wave it around and play with it. The bottom-heavy stand keeps it upright. So far, none of the fibers have become bent or tangled. Recommended."
3,Shiny!,"I bought this as an xmas gift for my little brother who has downs syndrome. This light is a very nice blue color and the base is fairly heavy which holds it in place. The fiber-optic strands themselves slip out of the base very easily, which could be an issue for some people. My brother liked it well enough, he likes LED stuff. I think my dad and I spent more time playing with it though, haha.This light takes 3 AA batteries, and I can't report on the battery life but I've heard no complaints so far."
1,Poor quality,The asking price is a clear indication how cheap it is. You get what you pay for. It arrived without the fibers. Just the base. I did get credit back.
1,"poorly made & designed, not as advertised","The specifications for this item list it as a 25 watt lamp that does NOT need or use batteries. In other words, an AC house current item. Not so. It requires 3 batteries. Still,I NEEDED something that used AC. Even then, I had problems opening the battery compartment. Eventually I discovered that I needed to unscrew a tiny phillips screw with a jeweler's screwdriver before I could remove the battery compartment lid. When the batteries were installed, I had to re-screw the phillips screw to keep the cover from falling out. Actually, I just secured it with a piece of tape. The effect of the item when on, however, was quite pleasant."
2,Not sure about this one,"Although I've been strength training for years, this workout is the first one to cause me to have back problems. The first DVD puts you through some very awkward lifting positions and it is hard to maintain proper form. Chalene's encouragement to use heavier weights than normal only compounded my problem. It's been 2 weeks since I completed the first DVD while I let my back recuperate and I haven't gone back to this routine again. The system has garnered an immense amount of positive feedback and I'm especially impressed by the comments of the over 40 set since i'm one of them so I may give it another try. But I'm still apprehensive."
5,Must have!,"I played college lacrosse with crazy training/lifting/running programs and my weight never seemed to go down and was still ""chunky"". I have p90X, insanity, turbo fire and tap-out....Chalean extreme is my favorite!!!! I have a tiny waste and abs! My huge thunder thighs and butt shrunk and toned up so much I had to buy all new pants....and I bought my first pair of jean shorts because I was no longer shy with my legs. The biggest plus for me is that they arent an hour long like most of the other work outs. After 30-40 min you are sweating...beat...and your job is done...back to life."
5,Love this!,"I love this system. It's well worth the money. You get 3 months worth of workouts and recipes and a plan for maintenance. I am on week 3 and have lost 10 lbs and several inches. If you are serious about seeing better results than you've seen in the past, make sure you focus on the eating part of the plan. So many people only do the workouts and then wonder why they don't look like the people in the infomercial. Beachbody uses real customers in their infomercials, so the results are real, but you HAVE to do all aspects of the program. Otherwise, you'll tone up but your results won't be as amazing as what you've seen on TV. One other note is that you will need heavier weights than you may be used to - yes, even if you're a woman. Start with what you have and then consider investing in some additional weights or bands when you feel like the exercises have become easy. This program is for real and I love it!"
5,Very Effective,"This program truly works. I've lost over 23 pounds on this programs in eight weeks. I also had recently had knee and foot surgery. I have not had any problems with that knee or foot throughout this program.She will work you hard, but encourage you at just the right times. I haven't found her annoying at all - although sometimes the back up people can be a bit annoying, but I think that may be a personality flaw of mine. Her program does not bulk you up, but you will gain muscle and slim down.I highly recommend this for anyone looking to slim down!"
4,Love the workout,I did buy this product used so it didn't come with a calendar so I had to go online to find one. I warn you the disks can come lose during shipment so be careful where you purchase the product. Luckily I all ready had thigh toner band because mine didn't come with it (I guess that is what you get when you buy used.).I am only in the beginning stages of this workout program but I do enjoy how challenging this can be (I consider myself in the intermediate stage). Make sure you have different size weights to get the results that you want.
2,I loved turbo jam but do not care for chalean extreme.,I only did a few workouts and was not feeling it. No desire to do these workouts. I loved turbo jam(did them a couple years ago and still have them on my shelf but got bored eventually and moved onto other workouts) and own all of those dvds. I also own turbo fire but it is hard on my knees and a little too intense and so I do not do that one much either. As for weight training dvds I prefer Jillian Michaels or the Firm.
5,Blown away,This is an incredible workout. It's been three weeks since I started working out and everybody around me can already see a difference. I do add extra 30 minutes of cardio to the routine though. Highly recommended!
2,Don't overpay!,"Just so you know, you can get this item directly from the Chalean Extreme website for $90.00 and pay $20.00 in shipping and handling. In addition, they provide some free workout accessories. I bought this as a gift from my wife for Christmas and didn't realize I could get it for less from the official Chalean Extreme website. Do yourself a favor and don't overpay for this item on Amazon through this seller."
1,disappointing,I purchased this after doing a few rounds of P90X and Insanity. This is a huge disappointment. I tried several of the workouts and found them boring and unproductive. I didn't get my heartrate up at all and in order to get any benefit out of the strength moves I had to up my weight so much that it irritated my rotator cuff. I felt like I hadn't worked out at all. I am returning it.
3,Great workout program however video quality could be better,"Love this workout program by Chalene Johnson. If I could give a feedback just for the workout program, I would give it 5 stars.However as an overall product, I had to deduct 2 stars for the low quality slightly pixellated video and the volume that seems to be rather loud to me. The ads at the start and at the end of the programs are also quite annoying. Basically it almost seems like the videos were made for internet streaming and then they decided to make DVDs out of them.My shipment did not come with the thigh toner band and the fat caliper as described. So if you are expecting these, check with the seller first before purchasing."
5,"Good product, nice seller","The DVD set arrived quickly, in a new sealed box as promised. Haven't tried the workout yet. Thought some guidebooks also came with the purchase, so the seller sent them to me, no questions asked."
2,She talks too much,"i started this workout with the best of intentions, but quickly grew bored and annoyed all at the same time. I'm sure that if I had stuck to this program i would have seen results but I found that Chalean talked waaaaaay too much during the workout. There wasn't a second going by that she wasn't saying one thing or another. Whatever happened to just counting for a little bit? Maybe I should have muted it and put my own music on..."
4,JUGGALO FROM OHIO,ALL I HAVE TO SAY IF THIS IS THE SAME ONE THAT COMES WITH THE COMIC BUY IT; IT IS A MUST FOR ALL JUGGALOS. ALSO TRY TO FIND THE PENDULUM COMIC #1. IF YOU DONT KNOW WHY YOU ARE NOT A TRUE JUGGALO AND ARE NOT WORTHY OF THIS CD. WHOS GOIN CHICKEN HUNTIN'?
2,POOR,Received with one marble missing; called manufacturer directly was told play with one short as they do not have any extra marbles.....they did refund money.
4,Sumo marbles,Push you opponent off the board. Good stratagy board game with think ahead and spacial thinking. No gracful way to lose. Can be frustrating for the loser.
4,"Easy, fun, brain stimulating",It's classically simple and yet keeps young minds sharp. All age will enjoy this gam of strategies.
3,Abalone Game,"I bought this game for my 15 yr old daughter. She heard and knows of the game and likes playing it with her cousins. I purchased it over the internet. The game's fine, it's the shipping of it. The plastic holder for the black and white balls was damaged by the time it reached Singapore. No, I'm not pursuing the matter, as it'll take ages to settle and I'm not going to post a pix of the damage goods on the internet either - cldn't be bothered. Just want to let people know that when u order this game, plse ask the shippers to be extra extra careful when handling it."
1,A disappointing non-mystery,"Yes, the feel of the 1930's is here, what with the election of FDR on the horizon, and the influence of the building of Hoover Dam integral to the life of at least one citizen of Voorburg. But, really, this short read is boring and untypical of Jill Churchill's earlier entries in the Grace and Favor series. I am sorely disappointed. Where is the mystery? Lost in the midst of a wandering story line. The suspense? Minimal. My suggestion is: don't waste the money. And my hope is that Churchill's next novel in this line will be up to the level of her first two books. I read it, but I put it down many times, and found the conclusion to be quite anti-climatic! Don't bother!"
3,Unfinished disappointment,"As much as I loved the first 3 in this series, it was disappointing that this one lacked charm. Lily's lovely manners, Robert's vivacity, alot was missing. Was Jill Churchill rushed into publishing? I hope she returns to form in book 4. Books 1-3 made me feel as if I was looking into my grandmother's life during the Depression. It was fascinating, especially the way people treated each other and held themselves together. Please do more, Jill."
2,GRACE & FAVOR,I read this book and it was okay at first but I was bored with it rather quickly. I put it down after the first two chapters. I would rate it between 1.25 and 2 stars.
3,not satisfied,Dont understand why it has 2 big ones..makes no sense..... other than that its not bad..fitted an old range perfectly
4,Good quality,Good product but trim rings did not fit my burners. I needed the type that attach to the hinged burner supports. These just rest inside the hole and could not be modified to work. I kept them anyway for the nice pans.
2,items are smaller than described,"Items didn't fit like described, unfortunately I didnt try them in time to return them. I don't think I will order any items like this in the future."
2,Different from my originals,"These are not exact replacements for my GE/Hotpoint stovetop with hinged burner elements.The cutout shape in the drip pan is smaller than on the original pans. Consequently after installing the pans and rings, the elements will not sit back down flat like they are supposed to."
3,"thin, just okay","Am a little disappointed at the thin metal of the drip pans and rings. The original ones were in a word, 'sturdy'. They could not be bend, dented or marred without considerable force being applied. These replace those and they can be bent, dented or marred very easily."
5,Amazing,"It is amazing that designer imposters was able to come this close to the real thing. This smells amazingly similar to Armani Code for women and I must say I am very impressed and happy to have a body spray that cost me a few bucks that smells this great. Unlike a lot of body sprays, the designer imposters body spray actually seems to last."
3,A Great Auto Glass Cleaner,"Due to multiple negative reviews in regards to film and streaking, I almost did not purchase this product. I decided I would not go near it with all the options out there.I'm glad I tried it by accident as it was the only real choice at a local Pep Boys. I don't know what other people are smoking, or maybe since that review they changed something.It worked great for me on my Windshields, headlight lenses, and rear brake light lenses.As to whether it repels the rain, I have not really tested that yet. I just wanted to state it DID NOT film or streak at all for me. Infact, how well it did perform makes me dubious of the reviews that before me.EDIT: I've found that this product performs better on plastics than on real windshields. I would stick to Megiuars glass cleaner."
1,"Love Rain X, HATE THIS!","I normally use the spray foam cleaner from Rain X and it is wonderful. Ive had a hard time finding it lately so I bought this stuff. BIG MISTAKE! It does do a wonderful job cleaning, but so does Windex. When it rained the next day, my windshield was so streaked I could barely see out of it. It has been a week since I applied it and it is even worse! I had to roll down my windows to be able to pull out of my driveway this morning because the sun was shining directly on to the dew/streak covered windshield that would not clear up.I will never buy this agian."
1,Worthless.,"Went to my local O'Reillys auto parts looking for real rain x but all they had was this. I was immediately skeptical but bought it anyway so the trip wasn't wasted. When I got home and tried it, my concerns were validated. This is essentially a shitty windex with a splash of rain x in it. It does a mediocre job of cleaning windows, leaves streaks and the rain repellant barely helps. The instructions say to just spray it on and wipe it off but the original oily rain x requires a few minutes to soak in. I even let this sit for 5 min the second time but it didn't work any better as a rain repellant.Disappointed. Get the original."
1,Terrible at everything,"Does a horrible job at cleaning (leaves terrible streaks even after ten minutes of going at it with a microfiber towel), and doesn't really provide much repellency (totally a word) at all. Truly the worst of both worlds.Save your money and get something that will streak less, like maybe mud... or shoe polish..."
1,Really bad,"The rain repellent might work, but the wiper starts skipping all over the place.Not only that, it doesn't last one day until the wiper starts skipping.Rain repellent isn't as good as you think either, because if you don't wipe the windshield while raining, you won't be able to see the front when a light flashes towards you(such as car's headlight from the other side of the road or streetlamp) because the light gets reflected from the rain all over the place.Do not buy."
2,smears & streaks,"very hard to wipe off, wants to leave streaks & smears,expected better from rain-x, will not buy again, does not domuch to repel rain like rain-x window treatment which is a very good product!"
1,dont like it,"This stuff leaves streaks on my windshield after I use my wiper blades, reducing visibility."
1,Terrible,"Title says it all this spray is terrible. The car fanatic that I am I saw these and loved the idea of helping my cars' visibility during the rain. Too bad this spray doesn't do that. I bought these yesterday and sprayed them immediately. And today is rained, not only did it rain, it poured. And I was extremely scared because the spray made the wipers skip and I was basically driving blindly. So I may have thought the issue was my wipers, but I switch the wipers from car to my moms' car, and my wipers were fine on her car, but hers did the same as mine. I went to the auto zone and told one of the associates of my predicament, and kindly replied and told me many people have an issue with this spray. It all depends on the pressure of the blades onto the window. So basically their is a 50/50 this spray will work. Why take a chance with your safety?"
2,Only good as a glass cleaner,"I would give it one star, but it is a nice glass cleaner. I didn't have any problems with streaking or residue. Very disappointed that it did not repel the rain at all. The repellent is why I bought this in the first place and the glass cleaner should have been the bonus. Shame because it was a nice concept."
1,Awful,After cleaning my car windows with this stuff they are now streaked something awful. Tried several others products to get wash the Rainx off but the windows are still streaked. I don't know how they can say their product enhances driving visibility. It sure doesn't on my windows. Still haven't been able to get the streaks off. If anyone has a suggestion it would be very much appreciated.
2,Doesn't repel as well as Rain X original formulation,"Picked this bottle up at the store and thought it was as good as the original formulation. During the rain storms, I noticed that the water did not repel off the glass as well. I'm going to return and get the real mccoy."
2,"Disappointing, leaves a slight haze after rainstorm","I tried this product as I clean my windshield regularly, particularly before rainstorms, for maximum vision clarity. It does indeed wipe off streak-free ... IF you use a clean, dry microfiber cloth after cleaning with this fluid and a paper towel or rag.What disappointed me was that after driving in heavy rain, in which water was beading up about as well as a scrupulously clean windscreen, usinga competitor glass cleaner, light mist formed on the window from mild spray on the road. This actually reduced visibility, and I had to use my single-swipe wiper function more than without Rain X. I also noticed a slight haze on the window, evidenced by a halo around oncoming vehicles' headlights.It's well known that Rain X has to be used regularly, or the window loses its hydrophobic quality, and a haze forms. As I mentioned, usinganother productregularly, I get a very clean window which rain rolls off effortlessly, and leaves no hazy residue."
2,Not the real thing,"I was hoping to find 2 good products in one.Instead, I got an ok glass cleaner but the water repellent quality is much diminishedcompared with the original RainX product."
1,Cleans and fogs,"All it does is clean the glass and leave streaks. As far as rain repellant goes, I live in a desert and for some reason after applying the stuff my windows manage to collect all the moisture in the air and create a wonderful fog that I cannot see out of. I'm just going to toss this stuff and get the real Rainx..."
4,A good choice,"Pros: plenty of space -- traveled around Africa for 2 weeks and had plenty of room for a multitude of clothing (options for warmer and cooler climates) and room to bring home some souvenirs, not heavy at all, comfortable strapsCons: zippers were hard to open, got stuck often"
5,morrral,tremendo bolso lo unico es que amazon me lo envio en una caja demaciado grande y cobraron mas por el envio que lo que me costo el morral
5,Performs as promised,We use this oval bred form to bake all kind of artisan breads. It bakes all breads very well and we highly recommend this form.
1,It's a sticky one,"I bought two and I tried them many times but I failed. The first trial was done by inserting the dough in it as normal. After I got it out from the oven, it was sticked strongly and I pulled it out but it was destroyed. The second trail I used some oil and flour but I failed for the second time. Also, the shape of the final product wasn't good. I stopped using them and I returned back to the manual work to produce the professional baguettes. I don't recommend it."
5,The Germans Are Back!,"Sasha K, is back, with a new group of musicians, and it all works very well. KMFDM are back fron a almost two year hiatus from new material, and if ""boots"" is any indication of what ATTAK is going to be all about, then i think we're all in for a supprise... KMFDM on the radio? on mtv? on the cover of spin or rolling stone? All possible my freinds... so pick up boots to tide yourself over until ATTAK hits stores in march..."
1,????,"What were they thinking???? Ill-concieved, poorly executed. I can't think of enough bad things to say about this single. Further proof of the continuing decline of a once great band."
3,This is not all of the original Seekers.,I was dissapointed that these were updated recordings. Although still very good.
2,Disappointing with no Judith Durham,"Judith Durham's crystal clear tones and soaring powerful voice are sadly lacking in this compilation of Seekers songs. This is not a criticism of the band per se, however, it must be recognised that it was Judith's voice as well as 'The Boys' skills that took them to the top of the international charts worldwide. Sorry, but you cannot beat the original combination, no matter how you try."
5,The Best of The Seekers,"I think The Seekers are a classic. Both myself and my husband love their music. Another reason I love this CD is that one of the songs, ""A World Of Our Own,"" is OUR song. How about that!"
3,NOT THE BEST; NOT THE WORST,"It's okay; but many of the recipes are not authentic and have been ""calmed down"" for general consumption. Try the WEB, there are some really great Santa Fe recipes there. Snce 1967, I have been to Santa Fe at leat 25 times; it is a shame what has happened to the ""authentic"" retaurants as the outsiders have moved in!! There is very little true Santa Fe foods available in Santa Fe; you have to get at least 20 miles out of town to find true New Mexican recipes."
4,Very Fun Kite,"I am new to the stunt kite scene, but I have to say that this is one durable kite. I am still learning the basics and this kite is holding up very well to some hard ground impacts. When the wind is blowing steady this kite is very easy to keep in the air, when the wind srops off this gets much more challanging. 8 miles an hour is about the minimum that you need to fly this kite. Over all a great kite to start stunt kiting."
1,something is frying in the oven.......hopefully Nika!,"Basically, to sum it up in four words, this is the worst book in the entire world. its called a cookbook, so i though it would have food in it, but it has these weird recipes which murder innocent parrots, spray paint dogs, and do the macarena! What the hell! If you want to read a GOOD book, read What Happened to Henry. Oh yeh, and if you want some advice, whatever you do, DONT Go INTO THE BASEMENT! JItkis will be there to suck your blood! He did it to me, and my blood turned into pasta! thats the only recipe in this damn book!"
2,Wasnt completely happy,"I bought this toy for my three year old daughter, She LOVES Elmo. I thought it was so0o cute and concidering shes in that ""I want to take care of my baby"" stage, I thought a baby Elmo, awesome! But when she opened it and started to play, I thought it would do and say more then it does. Im glad I didnt pay the 22.00 theyre charging in the stores or Id be really upset."
4,Great Elmo toy,"My son loves this Elmo. He got it for his first birthday because I fell in love with it in the store. The voice, phrases and songs are so cute without being overly obnoxious (as I find TMX to be). I knocked off a star because, as the previous reviewer said, it isn't soft. You can definitely feel the mechanics and voicebox beneath the fur. However, I did not purchase this toy for it to be a 'lovey' or for my son to sleep with, so I really don't mind that. I bought it as a toy for him to play with - which it excels at."
2,Its cute but...,"This Elmo toy is cute but it is hard, not cuddly. It is a little frightening to a sensitive child also. The voice is pretty garbled and hard to understand, so I don't think there is much educational value. and it is expensive for a stuffed doll, that is really ugly if you don't know what Elmo is... those bulging eyes..yuck."
4,Great First Gift Your Little One,Got this for my little guy's first Christmas. Three Years later it is in great working condition! I got a great deal too! Just watch because the body is hard so you need to supervise little ones.
4,Up Up not good for Falling Down,"This is a great Elmo, one of the funnest and best out there, if only it was more durable. After a few tumbles (and let's face it, with it being directed at toddlers there will be tumbles) it's limbs just don't move right, or don't all move, anymore. It wasn't long before he was motionless altogether, but she still loves him. He still talks, too. He just no longer moves. I had also bought one for my newphew and he has the same problem with his. So all in all, it's still pretty worth it, but be aware the moving won't last."
4,cute but not cuddly,"My 16 month old got this for Christmas and she loves it! She laughs and dances when he sings and understands when he asks to be picked up and hugged. The only drawback to it is that it is very HARD. It is not something she could snuggle in bed with. I think she would enjoy that a lot, but then if it was softer, it would not be able to sit up, kick legs, etc..."
3,Great Product - Parts Missing from Order,"This was an item my adult daughter requested for Christmas. She says the product is great, but arrived missing two bolts needed to mount the ""bolt-on-clamp"" to her bicycle, which required her to purchase them from a local hardware store. She states the product reviews she had read for this item on amazon's website included statements from more than one reviewer that their baskets had arrived without all the necessary and promised parts.So, a word to the product vendor - how hard can it be to make certain EVERY shipment contains all the parts? These aren't rocket components you're selling here!!!"
3,not same as the picture,"I purchased this basket because of the perfect look and the great reviews. I'm sure it would have worked well on a bike but when I opened the box, I noticed there was a blue round plate in front of the baket saying ""WALD"". I specifically have chosen a basket without this kind of advertisement and it was not shown in the product pictures. I am sending this back. Very disappointed."
5,Great basket,I looked at a lot of baskets before selecting this one. I really like the ease of how the basket hooks to the bracket & was surprised at just how sturdy it is once locked into place. The bracket is easy to mount & takes only a screwdriver. Wald has been making baskets for a long time & they know what they're doing. We put 6 loose beer bottles (full) in and the basket felt sturdy.
5,Loved it.,"I loved this CD. I first heard of them on public radio herein Memphistown. I immediately had to purchase it and have enjoyed it ever since. Recently while attending a String Cheese Incident in Portland, Oregon, this CD was being played for the background music while waiting for the boys to play. What wonderful music to listen to while chillin and waiting on somemore wonderful music from the Cheese."
4,Peace,"I'm not a Deadhead and wouldn't have bought this CD on my own, but a friend gave it to me, and I like it a lot. I agree with your reviewer's assessment. It's not a CD that will knock your socks off, but it makes a mellow accompaniment to an evening spent curled up with a good book in front of a roaring fire."
5,wonderful!,"I bought this CD for my husband, who is from Ireland. I have been slowly trying to ""teach"" him about the Dead, and this was a wonderful way to introduce him to their music. All of the songs are beautiful - I just wish there was another album!"
1,Phonetic?,"Oh this record is awful. It's not good Celtic music, but it's just terrible as any sort of Dead-related music. EVERY song sounds rushed whereas The Grateful Dead were always Masters of Pace and Time.And the guy's voice - ah! It's wimpy and forced. Really bad; so bad that I even wonder if he knew what he was singing. I'm even wondering if he sang these songs phonetically.) Vince Welnick sounds better, and you know how bad he sings.If you even remotely like the Dead, protect your mind by keeping away from this sophomoric effort. Try Jazz is Dead instead."
1,"At first ok, later bad...","When the speakers came, they were wonderful. For a little price I got a good quality sound. But after a week it is annoying. I'm very dissapointed... I didn't expect a miracle, but now the speakers cannot be used at all. Another thing: they didn't arrive with a USB cord as other people said (not a seller's problem since after buying them, I realized the USB was not included)."
4,Great product for so cheap.,"I have to say that I am impressed. Don't get me wrong, this tiny speaker system sounds like a tiny cheap speaker system. We use it when we go to the river and it works fine just to have some tunes. The reason I like it is because it is very inexpensive and works well for it's intended function. I must be honest, I figured I was wasting money when I bought this. I never expected it to last more than a month. However we have dropped it in the sand numerous times, It has had chairs and everything else under the sun dropped on it and it's still ticking. It might even deserve 5 stars but I usually reserve 5 star ratings for really high quality merchandise. Don't hesitate to buy this if your expectations are realistic."
5,Great Speakers!,Got this for my brother and he loves it! I've listened to it and it's great sound for small speakers.
2,Thought they were pretty bad.,"There was a lot of hype and positive reviews on this, so I thought, ""What the hell, it's 3 bucks"".They really weren't good. There's a lot of static or interference that can only be drowned out when the speakers are on max volume. Even then you can still hear the static in the background.Very very cheaply made. The speakers are like silver-spray-painted cardboard, the plastic is pretty weak.It's easy enough to use though, very simple. I guess that's the plus.I guess it's what you can expect for $3-$5, but honestly it isn't worth even that."
2,Battery power only,"These are ok for the price. I wanted something to let me listen to my iPod while I fall asleep. These didn't work because they would play into the night, draining the batteries with no timed shut off feature."
1,IGgFactory Handhelditems jipped me.,"Not only did this seller overcharge me for shipping (charged me DOUBLE what their shipping rates page said - $8.99 to send a 10 oz package USPS!!!), and wouldn't fix it when I complained, they also sent me a DIFFERENT BRAND of iPod speakers. Like I wouldn't notice??? I am very unhappy with this purchase. Beware!"
3,review for PRO-POWER portable speakers,"I would have liked to have had more information on the specs, such as: whether or not it was battery or power operated. Otherwise, worked well."
3,Good in functionality...,"This speakers are obviously not a great choice if you want something PERFECT for your iPod...They are good if you understand that they are there to sound and make their job, but nothing else, considering their price. A simple couple of stereo speakers with a standard audio plug, and, by the way.. Not very good looking"
1,HORRENDOUS Sound Quality,These weren't even worth the $8.99 (plus $7.46 S&H) that the Amazon partner charged. The sound is AWFUL.
1,It is very bad..,"The portable speaker is really small and cheap, but the quality of the sound is very bad. I cannot bear it at all. Since it is only several cents.. I can't expect too much."
1,Product Does Not Work,"I am a 10 year old who has been saving up for a long time to purchase an ipod and accessories. I purchased this product after I saw that this got ""good"" reviews. I came home from a week of summer camp, and my mom said it had come. I ran up to my room to try it out, I turned it on, plugged in my ipod and played a song. It wouldn't play and sounded broken. I'm going to return it and get a better one(how hard would that be?)."
1,Not even worth 2.88!,"This is probably an instance of ""you get what you pay for""--but this is a WORTHLESS set of speakers. the volume is SO LOW you can only hear it-- even on its highest volume--if you are sitting right beside it. It might be good for an office cubicle where you want very low volume so only you can hear it. that's about it. It is so quiet you have to lean into it to figure out what song is playing. a total waste of even 2.88 + shipping and an absolute disappointment. I can see why they had to reduce it from 49.99 to 2.88!"
1,portable speakers,"You get what you pay for. The speakers are about or slightly below the quality of lap top computer speakers. But, I knew what I was getting and the work for my purposes. Do not expect even near quality sound. Ideally, they let you broadcast example cuts from your IPod ... for a friend or such. As to delivery of the goods, they arrived before the expected delivery date and in perfect condition."
4,PRO-POWER - Portable speakers,"In short, excellent product for its ""price"" and very portable and handy. Only problem is, the length of USB cable is very small, so you have to keep these speakers on the laptop itself, making it messy."
1,don't bother,this item did not work with batteries.....so much for portable.lol all i got out of this product was a poor home i-pod DOC THAT CAN ONLY BE USED AT HOME
4,"Great compact, portable speakers",Pros:1) Sturdy plastic material.2) Good clear sound.3) Very compact when closed (about 4 x 2.5 x 2.5 inches) and lightweight.4) Comes with vinyl(?) case.Cons:1) There is no volume control on the unit.2) Battery-operated only.3) A connector wire for the DC outlet with USB port at the end would have been nice.4) My Ipod-touch doesn't fit in the detachable cradle with its silicon sleeve on.
4,Great value for money,These small speakers are great value for money. You can't ask for more for the price. Nice sound quality and very portable. What more can you expect for such a low price!
5,Great speakers for the price!,"I just received my speakers in the mail. I am pleasantly surprised by the sound quality. After all of the negative reviews I was a little leary to purchase these, but I figured for the cost I should just try it out. I have used it so far for about 5 hours in a row and the batteries dont seem low at all. It does come with a USB cord that you can power through a computer. It also has a connection for a 6V so if you wanted to purchase a charger you could. The only thing is, my ipod has to sit upside down because my earphone connection is on the bottom of my ipod, but it actually works out well as I pick up the ipod to change the song anyway. Perfect for what I need and perfect for the cost!"
4,PRO-POWER Portable Speakers,"The speakers work well with anything that headphones would normally plug into, and the batteries last much longer than expected. I have had my speakers for 5 weeks now and use them about 5+ hours on average a week, and I am yet to change the batteries. However, the sound produced is often fuzzy (not horribly, but enough to notice). Great buy if you're looking for cheap speakers to use outdoors, but I would recommend something different if you're looking for an indoor decoative speaker."
5,Powerful little speakers!,"Our speakers arrived today, and they amaze us. Great sound, well-constructed, fold up compactly for easy travel.Since the frequency response is 150-18KHz they do put out nice sound...not the ""tinny"" version I had feared. These are nice little speakers! (After all, they ARE amplified)The included USB power cable allows you to power them from a computer, and also from an ""IPod"" charger/adapter. Actually, we've just ordered a different brand ""IPod"" power adapter from Amazon for $2.99 (iPod USB Travel Power Charger Adapter, by Handhelditems). Why waste $30.00 for an Apple version?If you want nice sound from small speakers, these little beauties won't disappoint you. You'll be pleasantly surprised!"
2,"Fair sound, not well made, but for the price, it's okay","I purchased these speakers to take with me on vacation. They do fold up nicely and the sound is about as good as a typical portable radio, and they are nice to have when you want a simple solution for listening to your iPod while on the road. However, beware that the unit is very cheaply made. I found that I could not put on the battery cover without displacing the batteries enough that the unit would not power on. I had to leave the battery cover off or loose on the unit. I don't think these will be a permanent set of travel speakers for my iPod--they are just too cheaply made to be reliable. It's worth the money I paid--but just barely."
1,"Good speaker, but may need some home fixing.","The problem with these speakers is the glue used to adhere the speakers to the plastic housing. The glue becomes brittle and loses it's adherence. My speakers fell apart because of this.So, I unscrewed the housing and stuffed a folded paper napkin between the inside back of the speaker housing and the metal back of the speaker, to cause the speaker to push forward against the housing. Then I screwed it back together and it was fine. For the price I don't mind doing this and I like the sound and portability and would actually recommend these speakers. I like these speakers and their sound quality but I can't seem to edit my one star rating."
3,Excellent for the price!,"I bought these for $2.03 + $2.98 S&H; so I'm pretty satisfied with the product. I honestly did not expect it to be as good as it is. However, I did expect them to be white. Mine were black, but that's fine.As long as the volume is NOT on max for both the iPod and speaker, the sound is totally acceptable. However, when you max out the volume on both, it's pretty staticky, like a radio with bad reception. Mine just came today, so I don't know about the durability of the product, but for $2, I'm not too concerned about it. As long as it doesn't break after less than a few months of use, in which case I will update this review."
2,Silent Speakers,"Digilife Fold-Up Compact Speakers for Apple iPod (Travel Size), WhiteThe design is wonderful and the price is outstanding. The only problem is that you can barely hear thru them even at maximum volume. It seems like a mismatch in impedance maybe. I really wish they did work well.This was on an Apple IPod Nano. It is possible the speakers were not designed for this model. If so, that should be stated in the product information."
2,MP3 Player,"Had a prompt delivery. But upon opening the unit I found one of the speakers loose and needed to be re-mounted. When turned on the sound was intermittent and low in volume. I had to repair that... Finally this ""well"" made item from China was playing the music from my MP3 with the expected quality of an $8 MP3 player."
4,Satisfactory,"This product is pretty much as advertised. There was no carrying case, which was a slight disappointment. Also, it wants to keep falling over, when you try to set it up to hold the voice recorder (or ipod, as the case may be). The sound is acceptable. So, overall, I would give it an ""OK"" - nothing more, nothing less (condidering the price)."
4,perfect portable speakers,"I got these speakers for my ipod I don't need them for anything huge just an alternitive. the're perfect,small,loud,covenient,. But on the other hand you get what you paid for they are made a bit cheap but other wise excelent."
3,Prompt timing...would definitely buy again from this company,I am happy with the product and the delivery time from the company...had no problems would purchase again from them.
3,okay for the money,"at first when i got the speakers i was thrilled...they worked great but eventually the sound quality was distorted when i tried to play it medium loud. Now I have to replace the batteries so frequently and the spring where one of the batteries goes broke off...i now use a piece of tinfoil therebut honestly, i can't complain because i paid a $1.50 for the speakers!"
4,For this price. . .,"...they're fine. I teach, and this is great to carry to class to play a recording through my IPod. Very odd thing,though--it doesn't work with the battery cover on! And even odder, someone else has had the same problem. But again, at this price if it works why bother to return it?"
4,great price.,not the best sound ever but great for the price. i use it in the bathroom and on the beach all the time. great buy.
4,Unbelievable for the price,These tiny speakers sound decent. They are loud enough for in-th-room listening. They cost me $4.03. You can't go wrong!
2,Picks up radio when there is no signal,"It provides mediocre sound when signal is provided to it, as may be expected. But, when I connect it to the computer and I am not playing any music, I can hear faint radio signals it picks up - annoying!"
2,Worked good for a few months,"Like others have said, these speakers are great for the money and great for inside use ONLY. I took mine to the beach and turned up the volume and the speakers blew. I bought mine from TJMaxx and it was great for my office, but now have to trash them..."
2,"Seemed like a great idea, but...","I admit, my standards weren't too high considering I paid only five bucks for these. They are nicely designed though. I love the design and how they fold up small, and how the headphone jack cable folds around the unit in a little groove so it's hidden.But the sound problems are pretty bad. If the volume is loud at all, (not even blasting loud) they buzz and it's impossible to enjoy the music or understand what they're saying. Also, there's odd static that I can hear when the volume is at any level, even when there's no music coming through the speakers at the time.Overall, these are NOT even worth the cheap price I paid for them. They are okay for lower volumes so they get two stars, but they wouldn't be too good to hear the music very well across a room.I don't recommend them. Spend a few bucks on another kind."
3,Didn't work.,"This doesn't work with an iPhone. It doesn't fit in the holder, and the interference makes the speakers have an awful clicking sound. The shipping charges (at the time I ordered it shipping was $6) were outrageous. It was shipped in a plastic bag via USPS Priority, and took a week to get here. Why don't companies use Flate Rate Priority boxes?! This could have cost $4.80 to ship."
1,Portable speakers,Ordereded portable speakers for my wife's ipod.Upon opening we found the item broken.It would cost me as much to return item. As it cost.Complete waste of money & time.Joe Phelan
2,"OK, not great","Reviews and low price suggested not much to lose if these didn't work. Bought for MP3 player, mostly to listen to audiobooks. Good thing, because it won't play the music on the MP3 player, neither classic nor rock. Also, the cord really IS minimal. Overall, OK but not great. Wish it would play music."
4,great value and decent sound,"I purchased these speakers to use in my massage therapy practice. I do corporate chair massage at companies and, while the sound is nothing like the bose speakers I use at my therapy office, they do play enough of a quality sound to create the relaxing ambiance needed to make my clients forget they are at work. Every now and then my 14 year old son hooks his ipod to them and plays his upbeat music, and they are good enough to entertain our family with music and laughter. The price I paid for them was well worth it, and I got better sound than I expected. They play a long time on the AAA batteries too."
3,Portable speakers,"I wish these speakers came with a 6v AC cord. Otherwise, they work great and are affordable."
3,you get what you pay for,"The first set I received did not work, but I was sent another pair within a week or so, which works, but not much power behind these speakers and you really need to make sure all the conections are tight or the speakers will buzz. The best thing is they are very portable and cheap."
2,At first I thought they were great,"The sound was great at first from these speakers. A day or two later I heard a periodic buzzing and shrill type of noise - very annoying. That's what you get, I guess for spending only $10 on speakers..."
4,Good product.,"For the price I paid, I was incredibly impressed with the sound that these little speakers generated. I would recommend them."
4,"Good sound output, worth the price",They are pretty easy and convenient to use and carry around. The sound output (I connect my iPod) is pretty decent. Definitely worth the price.
3,Great for travel,"We just took a vacation, and the speakers were great to take along to the beach and the pool, however, the Ipod does not fit in the area like it shows on the picture. When you plug into the headphone jack, the Ipod won't sit in the opening for it."
4,Can't beat the price!,"I bought these speakers for use in the operating room so that I wouldn't have to worry about one of the nurses knocking over expensive speakers and breaking them (as happened with my previous speakers). These are PERFECT! Provides music via an eminently portable device that is so cheap that the product is almost disposable. In fact, I had another pair that lasted about a year before I lost them, and it was no big deal to replace them. The sound is a bit tinny, but what do you expect for the price?"
4,Great little speakers,I have had these for about a month and for the price I don't think you could do much better. I use them at our coast lot and plug my mp3 in and have all the tunes I like.. The sound is amazing for the price.. I would recommend these..
4,Nice little package and good sound at a great price,"I wanted something that was truly portable to take on the road. I also didn't want to spend a lot. I'm not an audiophile by any means, but I do know what sounds good. This set provides a broad sound (not too tinny like I was half way expecting) that works great in a hotel room or at home in the kitchen. There is an inexpensive AC adaptor which is retrospect had I known at the time of ordering I probably would have gotten. However, I'm still on my first set of batteries after a month, so maybe I didn't really need it after all.- In short, I'm very pleased. I didn't give it 5 stars simply because the sound won't knock you over, but, hey, for the price and size this is a very good buy."
