3,David Copperdield,"One of the best novels by Charles DickensThis fantastic TV movie adaption of the grand Dickens story of ""David Copperfield"" is something all family must have.This Dickens tale is about a young orphan who suffers many hardships and tragedies before finally finding happiness."
2,Overwhelmed: Coping--,"Overwhelmed: Coping with Life's Ups and Downs I found book not very helpful> I am not sure who it would help, certainly not some who was actually feeling overwhelmed!"
4,Evans at his most inspired.,"Despite a somewhat out-of-tune piano (which he acknowledges), Evans and his great trio persevere. Hypnotic, relentlessly creative Evans throughout. A must-hear for all Evans fans, and jazz piano lovers in general."
4,It must be ...,"I'm not sure why many reviewers are calling this a coming of age film. They seem to me to be already very much of age, perhaps even into mid-life even before reaching university. Although hers somewhat more than his, their maturity shows in their adult mannerisms and how they don't get defensive in dealing with others. There's a moving scene between the fathers after the school play when, in an empathic way, one says to the other, ""I'm not surprised (you don't talk about it). It must be very hard for anyone to understand how tough it was.""Movie gold from Down Under."
3,Nicely done,"'Flirting' is the rare teen flick that one may actually recommend in good conscience, and one of the only examples of a picture about adolescence which doesn't descend into saccharine sentimentality. Charming, funny, excellent characterization particularly by Noah Taylor, who is strangely winning as bumbling, awkward Danny Embling. Definitely worth a watch."
3,"completely worth watching, but not great.","I really liked this movie, but it was.....there was just something missing. Thandie Newton was great and I like her acting style. Nicole Kidman was really awesome."
5,The movie was great.,Thandie Newton is a great actress. She stole the show with her performance as the only black in a predominately white environment. Her character couldn't isoloate herself from the rest but she couldn't let her guard down. I hope to see her in more films.
1,Drags,"I enjoyed the beginning of this book, but after a while it just drags. Could have been a nice story in the New Yorker, but as a book it just doesn't cut it. Forced my way to the end.Summary: Couple of guys want to get to this obscure place cause they like the name. Jump through lots of hoops trying to get permission. One of them dies. Permission comes. That's all folks."
4,"Great story, though it loses its steam","I would never had read this book had I not recently had the chance to see Huun Huur Tu, a throat-singing voice from Tuva. But now that I am fascinated by this little-known, remote area along the Russian-Mongolian border, I found this book very entertaining. It chronicles the enormous challege of trying to visit such a remote land in the days before Glasnost and a fascinating cast of characters at its heart.I think my only complaint is that the book loses steam at the end, which I guess is understandable, given the fate of its main protagonist. But overall, it is a wonderful testament to a group of brilliant folks, who spend years trying to follow through on a quest."
4,"The final chapter of ""Surely You must be Joking""","This book is more about Ralph than it is about Richard. But it gives us some insight as to what life was like living close to Dr. Feynman. He was a character and when he came up with going to Tuva how could you resist? Its so far fetched that it might just be possible for a couple of USA physicists to go to a place deep within the communist Soviet Union and make friends. Another great read in the series that starts in ""Surely you must be joking."" (BTW the first book is still the best of these 3. However I wanted to know more after reading each one so onward I treked."
2,Disappointing.,"I bought this book because I enjoy reading about Richard Feynman. I did not enjoy this book, although I really wanted to. Not only is this tale only peripherally about Richard Feynman, it turned out to be an amateurish, dull, and plodding recounting of an apparently frivolous goal turned obsession. The writing was lifeless and tedious. Although I got through the whole book, I found myself wondering why I bothered. If anyone wants my copy, e-mail me."
2,"Get to the point, will you Ralph?","This book feels very outdated and with only one immediate purpose, to stroke the ego of Richard Feynman. Leighton uses his time and space to write an homage to Feynman that is not that interesting. In fact, only in the last 40 pages do we learn anything about Tuva. If you are interested in this region of the world I recommend the film ""Genghis Blues"" instead. The film is way more insightful and interesting."
4,Tuva or Bust! A journey worth taking.,"Having the priviledge of seeing the play QED catalyzed my purchase of this wonderful book. This is no ordinary journey by no ordinary genius(es). It is a hilarious example of persistance required to learn all there is to know (without the aid of the Internet!) about an inaccessible culture, and then secure permission to travel to a dream-like land. This easy to read book makes me want to pick an obscure topic and make it my own hobby.My only disappointment is that the narrative lacked information about Professor Feynman's more personal trials and thoughts during this demanding period of his life. There were many chapters that rarely mentioned Feynman as the ""journey"" continued. Beyond that, it is a must read, not just for Feynman fans like myself, but for all of us that need to refresh ourselves with a bit of eccentricity in the form of a unique, personal goal."
5,awsome card,"I got the card a week ago. what a card.Sound is unreal,very clear.for the money there is no better card. Very happy."
1,This product is not what is advertised on the box.,"This product is not what is advertised on the box. Apparently, in the past, this was a retail version product. Now, the software is unavailable, the user guide is not included, and they offer no support for this product. A phone call to the company left me even more confused when they said the ones being sold now are OEM versions of the card that were packaged in a new retail version box. Don't expect any help in installing the card, using the features, or getting any of the cool software advertised on the box, it's not going to happen."
3,RECORDING DIGITAL AUDIO,"THE ONLY PROBLEM I HAVE WITH THE CARD IS THAT WHEN I RECORD DIGITAL AUDIO USING DIGITAL ORCHESTRATOR PRO THROUGH THE SANTA CRUZ, THROUGH A MICROPHONE, IT DISTORTS THE AUDIO. DON'T TRY TO USE TECH SUPPORT EITHER. THE ONLY CONTACT WITH TECH SUPPORT IS VIA EMAIL. THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. I KNOW MORE THAN THEM."
4,Santa Cruz,"Got this to replace the Creative Value Live! card on an XP system to see if strings would stop sounding like finger nails scraping a black board and it worked! The software interface is intellegent compared to Creatives kiddy junk and it's very easy to use. The Santa Cruz also doesn't distort piano notes or voice. The bundled software is kind of deceptive, most of it being demos, and the lite editions are truly ""light"" making them fairly useless if you want to use Midi. Overall I would still chose Turtle Beach over Creative being lower cost, better performance, easy to use and setup, and designed for people who are older than 12."
2,5.1 OUTPUT... not PROCESSING,"I was misled by the box's labeling which stated that it was dolby digital compatible... It is, if you send the digital signal to an external dolby digital processor. It does not decode dolby digital itself. I recommend going with a Creative Sound Blaster. You get the card that does the dolby digital decoding itself for just a little bit more money.If you don't care about that aspect of signal processing, then it would be a good card for you."
3,"Fair 80s nostalgia, but the score is best","For those who are looking for the original soundtrack score to the film, it's done by Thomas Newman. The same artist who did some other more recent and great soundtracks: American Beauty, Meet Joe Black, etc. I'm trying to find it too, but believe it may be unavailable."
3,The Best Music in the Movie is Not on This CD.,There is a background score of orchestral music in this movie that moves me everytime I see the movie. Does anyone else hear that? What/Who made that music?Pete
1,The name of the film totally describes this soundtrack!,"I'm sorry, but this ""soundtrack"" is trash. I don't know who the moron was that made the decision to release this compilation of crap instead of the stunning, magical,hauntingly beautiful original score written by Thomas Newman, but whomever they were, we can dismiss the notion that they had any concept about what people actually listen to and spend their money on when it comes to motion picture soundtracks. Its true enough that there are people who enjoy the pre-recorded covers included in the soundtrack. Nevertheless, the magnitude of original score's beauty renders the release of the songs only as utterly ridiculous. If I could have given this monstrosity a negative star rating I would have. If you are looking for the original score written by Thomas Newman, leave this one the shelves. Your ears will love you for it."
4,Less Than Zero Soundtrack,"Good collection of songs. Poison has a neat rendition of KISS's ""Rock and Roll All Nite"". A great Slayer cover of ""In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida"" is a great slash metal tune. Aerosmith's cover of ""Rockin' Pneumonia and the Boogie Woogie Flu"" sounds like nothing else, on par with ""Train.."", ""Walking the Dog"" and ""Come Together"" as Aerosmith's great cover songs. But, perhaps the steal of the record is a great Public Enemy song for enthusiasts and casual fans alike, ""Bring the Noise"" might have you coming back for more. Great collection on the car stereo or anywhere. The 4 out of 5 stars is mostly because of the song-to-song transition. Great artist sampler. Try it!!"
4,Danzig's Song,"You & Me (Less Than Zero) is actually an interpretation of the song ""To Sir, With Love"" with different lyrics. Listen to the 2 songs consecutively and its almost note-for-note. I would love to hear Glenn sing a version of the song he wrote for Roy Orbison to sing ""Life Fades Away""."
5,Real help for food addicts!,I have been trying to figure out how I can bring my children on board with my current plan of eating. This book provides useful tools and guidance with doing just that! Love the recipe options that are included for complete breakfast muffins to break up my usual oatmeal and cottage cheese.
1,Too Radical,This book is way over the top! Says that even artificial sweetener should not be used. I think the premise of what the author is saying that almost all food is bad for you- a sure way to set people looking to lose weight up to fail
2,Sophomoric At Best,"There isn't enough worthwhile substance to rescue this amateurish attempt at filmmaking. The intriguing, if somewhat cliche, storyline does little to disguise the blemishes and flaws in this movie. The major downfalls are the awkward and choppy scriptwriting and directing.In general, the character progression is unbelievable, exhibiting little to no natural transition from emotion to emotion during pivotal scenes. On the other hand, the acting is decent, but also suffers from the poor writing and direction. As the product of this, you end up with a movie that you don't want to watch but you want to know what happens at the end.I would NOT recommend this film unless you have an affinity for bad southern gothics or a vested interest in Gale Harold's career.DO NOT watch this movie if you're looking for gay or lesbian characters; it only touches upon gay themes."
4,A woman-as-heroine melodramatic thriller...a wonderful read!,"I first read this book in an American Women Writer's class in graduate school. E.D.E.N. Southworth was creating fearless, independent, intelligent heroines at a time when her contemporary best selling novelists were portraying silent and submissive heroines. Capitola and the other colorful characters in the story are unique and endearing, in spite of their melodramatic qualities. Because this was first a serial publication, every chapter is full of action and fun. I will always recommend this book to friends, and in fact, I am ready to name my first daughter Capitola! Read this book!"
2,Why do heroines have to be so fantastic!,"After reading this book, the only thought that came to my mind was that the heroine was just lucky to get through all the hurdles without even a scratch.Too fantastic to digest. But then aren't all such books are.I just couldn't understand few things, how Capitola managed to get out of every difficulty without problem, and how, all the smart villians, become dumb and do the stupidest act while she is there (whether they know it or not) and things are always in favour of our great heroine?"
4,heavy atomic masses,Esthero discovers the sound that will carry them into many people's hearts. The perfect cd to get up to fall asleep to and to put on the dance floor.
4,Spanish Tide alone is worth the price of admission,"While many critics seem to like Bandstand (1972), I prefer its predecessor, Fearless. Not as polished from a production perspective as Bandstand, the songwriting on Fearless has more variety and vitality.This album features solid blues (Between Blue and Me), humor (Sat'd'y Barfly) and beautifully concise progressive (Spanish Tide) tunes. All are wonderful vehicles for the incredible voice of Roger Chapman. For those of you unfamiliar with Chapman, I can only think of him as a cross between Phil Collins and Rod Stewart who drank and smoked way too much. Throw in Charlie Whitney on guitar and John Wetton (King Crimson, UK, Asia) on bass and harmonies and you have a band whose lack of success in the U.S. frankly astonishes me.When I listen to this today, it is still strikingly fresh as it was in 1971. Some of their musical structures may remind you of the Who, some may harken to Genesis. A unique band with an awesome vocal talent."
3,She Doesn't Know What She Wants,"This book started off great and ended pretty well but the middle wasn't great. The writing was excellent but the characters were weird and superficial. the plot went off on many different tangents. Overall not bad, but not great."
1,Dreadful!!,This book is just that - dreadful! The worst book I've read in years. I can find nothing complimentary to say about it. The characters are one dimensional and self-absorbed. The writing is sophomoric. The story line is formulaic and quite frankly boring. I didn't care one bit about anyone in this story. What a waste of my money. Who ever edited this one should be fired. Bookstores are full of entertaining chick-lit. If that's your prefered genre look else where.
1,predictable and ditzy,A predictable storyline with characters that seem dumb and ditzy...and a gaggle of friends (tries to copy the Sex and the city foursoume) that are have no depth! This is a book a girl does not want.
2,Buy another laminator,"I thought this would be a cool laminator to have for my club. Boy was I wrong. My documents were wrinkly. I even ran the documents through a few times. The last time, it ate the carrier. The binder part wasn't very good either. You have to use special folders. I can't believe the manufacturer intended this for the office when it can't even support my little club's laminating needs. It goes to show a good looking product doesn't necessarily delivers."
1,[stopped working] in 6 months,"This item is not particularly user friendly when it works. However, mine went south (B drive) after only 6 months. Then I realized that there is only a 90 day warranty, which is lousy. So Koss gets a resounding ""Boo!!"" from me."
5,Great system at an excellent price,"Based on the previous reviewer, I went ahead and purchased this item. I know that many of these burners seem to have occasional (or frequent) problems. I went ahead and risked getting a non-name brand and haven't regretted it for a second. This machines burns flawless CD's from just about any source. Soon, I will have all my tapes on CD and backup copies of my personal CD's. Get this burner!!"
1,Koss- I wouldn't recommend,"I have had my unit for approx. 2 years now. The playing side works geat,but the recording side has started to fail. You cannot record tracks off the cds now. You can't even record a whole cd, because it will not finalize. I should have spent an extra $200 on a better brand like Sony or Panasonic. I wouldn't reccomend this Koss cd recorder to anyone!"
3,Can't beat it for the price,"I got this unit on sale for under [price]. For that price, the deck performs very well.My purpose was not for CD dubbing, but dubbing other sources onto CDs. Analog inputs are very good from vinyl or cassette, although the silence-sensing auto track indexing is very flaky - like every CD & Dat recorder I've ever used. Lack of an input level control is far less of a hindrance than I expected.Digital input is only 44.1 with no sample rate convert, so forget digital dubs of those 32/48 Khz DATs or music DVDs.This is a very basic, reliable, consumer CD recorder. A good buy for the price if you just need the basics. Using CD/RW media (consumer ""music"" blanks) is a plus. If you really mangle a recording, you can just erase & do over.I saw in the manual there's a timed recording function which looks promising, but I haven't really explored it."
1,"You MUST use ""MUSIC"" CDs","This product is no longer worth the trouble. When it was first manufactured, the music industry was trying to guard against unauthorized duplication of CDs. Therefore, the CD-200 (like many other products) was programmed at manufacture to only record on ""MUSIC"" CDs. Music CDs are those for which the manufacturer has paid a royalty to the music industry (probably through RIAA, ASCAP, or BMI), and are specially marked as such. The only place I could find such disks was at Best Buy. In most stores, the pencil-necked teens who staff the music and computer departments have no idea what you are talking about and think, erroneously, that any CD will work. It will NOT. YOU CANNOT USE ""REGULAR"" CD-R DISKS TO RECORD IN THIS MACHINE. So, the best way to make or copy CDs is with a computer with a burning drive --- as most have these days. In most cases, a computer is less expensive. And it is certainly more flexible."
1,For the money It stinks,"I'M Editing this review because this has like others failed! The B drive doesn't read the discs. It records when it feels like it and seems to say RECOVER RECOVER very often. So I called the fine Koss people and they told me they stopped making the product do to a ""maximum defect"" their words. Oh Well, so to all those Koss purchasees out there I'm holding a Koss revolution and never buying another Koss Product again."
1,marie-vonne,"My girlfriend gave us the CDR 200 KOSS recorder for christmasbut we are unable to use it. It didn't have the manual. I need one. Can you help? If i have to pay i do not mind. Please advise.Please find below my mailing address. Thanking you in anticipation.Yours truly.MARIE-VONNE DE COMARMOND4670 BOUCHETTE STREETMONTREAL, QUEBECH3W 1C5"
3,hope this recorder is worth it heard lots of good things,i bought this item used need a manuel can anyone help me get a manuel so i can try it out thanks
4,Bright but blue,"This unit puts out a lot of light. It is definitely a pinpoint spot. It does not wash nearly as much as my regular spot bulbs. However, the light has a definite blue tint to it. I'm not sure how that may affect the color on the video of my performances, but will keep an eye on it."
5,great shelter option for an emergency,"We live on a fault zone and our area has exsperienced a huge earthquake in the past.As well we are prone to tornados.Also we hunt and hike a lot and there have been a couple of times when I was a bit turned around and ended up spending a night in the woods.Because of this I put together an emergency kit just in case the worst happens.Among the items I chose is this tent.It is lightweight enough to carry without noticeing it,in fact you could fit it in a shirt pocket.But if needed it will keep rain/snow/dew off of you in the event you find yourself in need of something overnight to stay in."
3,Tent of Last Resort,"Coughlans Tube Tent: Lightweight Emergency Shelter is what I would consider a last resort option when ""something"" is better than nothing. I have used this tent a couple of times and really was not impressed. Fortunately, I used it when the weather was not too bad although the temperature was in the low 20's. In inclement weather this tent will be completely ineffective especially in high winds, heavy rain or snow fall, etc.In an emergency situation the orange color is a good visual indicator if someone is looking for you. Another use for this tent is as a shade cover to provide protection from the sun especially if in a desert environment. If you have created an improvised shelter this tube tent can be placed on top to help keep rain from entering your shelter.Due to its small size it is worth throwing this tent in your gear just don't have very high expectations."
1,Emergecny Use Only and Questionable,This is def not a great or a well made item. It is about the thickness of two one time use panchos but much larger. It will do in a pinch. Even at only $10.00 I was surprised that is was so thin; you can actually see right thru it. It is light weight and if the weather isn't bad/ not too hot nor too cold it would do. It doesn't have any sides so you could cut some large trash bags to cover the sides to keep rain out if need be. Just don't forget to pack some duck tape with it.Honestly; I'd rather rely on a poncho or tarp it would offer much better protection and is so much studier. Not bad for dire emergency but I would spend an extra $5 or $7 and get a good tarp I think you'll be much better protected.I don't recommend the product.
3,A good skim of the topic,"This is basically a good book with some strenghts, but also some significant weaknesses:Strengths- Good intro to equipment- Very good safety info- Very good descriptions of when routers, tables, etc. are not the right tool/approachWeaknesses- Virtually no description of technique- Virtually no useful into on jigs (essential to robust router use)Overall, this book is useful for someone who has never picked up a router. Nevertheless, both beginners and more experienced users will also need to buy another book for the substantial material this one lacks.The author clearly has real expertise on the topic and writes well, but this is just far too thin on content to be a one stop guide for even a novice."
3,"Good for what it is, but...","I should have done more research before I bought this, but the book is exactly what it says it is; a book about routers.The 2 main points against it are- as someone else said, very little technique. As I mentioned, it's about routERS and not routING, which is my fault for not researching thoroughly- it has a lot of information about specific models, which is likely to be outdated and useless quite quickly."
2,To sum it up,"Let me help you out and save you some money. The router is a tool with a device that spins real fast and can remove wood. That's what I got from the book.Actually, in all fairness, the author did cover the differences between plunge routers and fix-based routers very well. The book also addresses the popular routers on the market though it seems likely that Porter-Cable may be subjectively promoted a bit much. Additionally, the photography was well done.As far as being a complete guide, it is not. I am particularly interested in learning the ends and outs of router usage and gained no insight here. Even when the book did resort to technique, the author used terminology not applicable to beginners and then did not bother to enlighten readers with an explanation nor with a glossary of definitions. In fact the book reminded me somewhat of old college texts where the author was more interested in impressing his own contemporaries than imparting knowledge on the unknowing."
4,The Router,Great book especially for someone like myself who is just learning routing. Lots of instructions and plenty of pictures for detailed information.
4,a bit dated but well done,"after completing my once in a lifetime trip on the DQ, I still wanted more- now I can watch this well made video in my living room. the creators hit all the main points of the vessel although briefly. longer would have been nicer. the video quality itself was great too."
4,Do you dare look away?,"Albums don't often come this brutally frank and some of the raw --- and graphic --- desperation makes the listener cringe. As far as the music goes, however, let's go out on a limb here: the Ig hasn't hit such a focused groove since 1979's New Values --- maybe not even since The Idiot (1977). Acoustic guitars wash over the crooning delivery and (sit down for this) arresting melodies are all over the place. When an artist takes a risk like this, there is usually a dud track or two, so you have to sit through the odd vile lyric (Nazi Girlfriend is the biggest embarrassment), a few brief spoken interludes that are strictly hit-or-miss and the strangely irritating and overlong I Felt the Luxury. In spite of all that, Pop hasn't sounded this good in a couple of decades."
4,Tell it like it is!,"Having bought the last 5 or 6 Iggy discs, I was really shocked by the material. I assumed, incorrectly, that it would be more of the same ala American Ceasar, Naughty little Doggy, and Brick by Brick. This album reminds us that at some time we all to have to pull up and take stock of life and living."
4,Surprenant,"Allons directement dans le vif du sujet: tous les titres de l'album ne sont pas indispensables. Cependant, on ne peut qu'etre agreablement surpris face a tant de sincerite de la part d'un artiste qui n'a pourtant plus rien a prouver. Quelques excellents titres tout de meme. Vraiment une bonne surprise."
1,Everybody Bombs Now And Then,"Fans either love or hate this album. I fall into the later category for this is without doubt the worst Iggy Pop album, and quite probably one of the worst rock and roll albums ever recorded, bar none. The songs are unimaginative, the musicianship lacking and most amazing of all is that the production is completely incompetent, amazing considering super producer Don Was handles these chores. It surprizing that this didn't completely kill Iggy's recording career. A prime example is the cover of ""Shaking All Over"". The song shows potential then never takes flight, instead stalling and crashing big time. The Who never imagined the song this way, and with good reason. And its among the better efforts on the album. Try as I might, I just can't listen to more than a few minutes at a time. It is that bad."
2,What a HUGE let-down!,"I'm not a diehard Iggy fan, although I think his decade-old ""Brick By Brick,"" also produced by Don Was, is one of the bext albums ever recorded by ANYONE. Iggy always seemed to me like an unguided missile whose raw power required a solid producer like Was to focus and concentrate. So I was really hoping for this one. WRONG! About a third of the cuts are (blessedly short) self-revealing personal monologues about whatever. BORING and who cares!! MMW are a terrible match for Iggy, I'm afraid. I'm surprised Was let this out of the building. Ten years haven't been kind to the WAS-Iggy equation."
1,Iggy's on a downward spiral,"As a lifelong Iggy fan that owns everything he has ever recorded, it's unfortunate to report that the great one is on a downward spiral. Avenue B is a boring, agonizingly unimaginative disc that sees his creativity burnt out. Even the songs with some potential... like Nazi Girlfriend... are executed with very little flair. I have played the disc repeatedly for years with the hopes of finding something worth remembering... and it still falls flat. Even the single, Corruption, sounds like a bad Zombie Birdhouse out-take. The downward spiral continued with Beat 'Em Up... an energetic rock album with more power... but with embarrasingly bad lyrics from one of rock's greatest poet lyricists. For golden Iggy... check out Raw Power from the Stooges era, Lust For Life, The Idiot, New Values... or for more recent solid Iggy, check out American Caesar... his last great album."
2,Sorry Iggy,"Sometimes Iggy gets lazy and this is one of those times. Sounds like he read from his diary and then the record company, in desperation, found someone to back him up. The cover of the Pirates' ""Shakin' All Over"" is classic. I don't have the import version listed here with the live Paris shows. But remember, Parisians love Jerry Lewis too!"
4,NPR has the best programming,"There is no other radio station that has better programming than NPR. The creativity, humour and complexity of their stories gives them a head up on all other media outlets. This CD is poignant, funny and interesting. The stories really do hold you in the car and in your driveway. There were times where we had to pullover because the story was so funny. In other situations there was not a dry eye in the car. I highly reccomend this CD. Although, ""Driveway Moments 2"" 2005 is not nearly as good. In fact I was completley dissapointed in the sequal."
2,These stories weren't the kind that I would sit in my car to hear,"I listen to NPR quite a bit and was excited when I ordered this CD. However, none of the stories on it were so interesting as to make me sit in the car and wait to hear the end. I think one of the ""This American Life"" CD's would have been a better choice."
1,rip off - crooks,"Ordered this t-shirt for my son and Old Glory, the supplier, did not send the order and just relinguished the order with no explanation. WARNING..do not buy from Old Glory..it's a waiste of time, they will get your money and then a few months later refund with no explanation. Old Glory is keeping the money in the bank and getting interest for the few months till the refund."
4,Classic,"Fantastic blues. Seminal. Good recording, modern fidelity (a lot of the great classics have poor tonal range.)"
2,If your're desperate...,I was looking for Suddenly There's A Valley and downloaded it as an MP3. The quality is so bad that I wouldn't recommend this to anyone - unless you're desperate for a song and don't mind the lack of quality.
2,Stream of Consciousness style detracts from value,"Sorry to part company with the crowd here.THe author's thesis -- that ""news"" and ad media severely blur the distinction between Real and Unreal -- sounded intriguing, and I wanted to see how the author developed it. Unfortunately, after a few dozen pages, it seemed like the book was a good EXAMPLE of that thesis, and not an elucidation of it. It reminded me of James Joyce, and while Joyce's style can be wonderful for a novel, it kind of stinks for an expository work. My second thought is that publishers have got to stop paying people by the word.The author's point seemed reasonable and based on common-sense -- my quarrel was he could have made it more succinctly, with better support, and with less verbosity.Oh well, enough said."
2,"intelligent, but lacks intellectual discipline...","Reading this book is like having to listen to your stoned parents bragging about how modern and cool they are for having a tevo, while you are busy hooking it up for them because they still can't figure out how to use it. Although de Zengotita brings up some interesting and important points, he has an incredibly convoluted (and, frankly, smug) writing style which unfortunately seems to be passing for intellectual rigor in the academy these days. A bigger problem is that he hasn't made the effort to organize these insights into any coherent theory or even anything coherent, period. The result is that we are left snippets of insight coupled with the vague notion that he's onto something really important, and frustrated with his refusal to exercise any intellectual or editorial discipline so that we can be more clear about what exactly that is."
4,"A lot of opinion, but good opinion.","I would like to give this review 3.5 stars, so I rounded up to 4.The book appears to be mostly informed opinions from Zengotita. It doesn't have as many facts and studies as I'd like, but his opinions are not wacky or anything. I certainly agree with most things he says. I agree that technical advances occur there is just simply more media for one to take in, therefore taking longer to reach a ""culturally accepted"" point of media intelligence.Zengotita's views in the book are, simply put, his views. Again, not much fact (although there is some), but it's easy to agree, and his observations are right on. I would also say one of the major points of the book is to show the reader HOW the media is affecting society, to make you aware. There is something to learn from this book, however, it's definitely geared more to those who are VERY interested in media and culture, not those who are just looking around."
4,not the usual junk,"Tired of your newsweekly's glitzy ""media"" column? Or establishment outlets like CNN Reliable Sources? This book is some non-corporate, free thinking... substance! (at last) Written from a genuinely philosophical bent, informed by history and the social sciences, this is not the kind of analysis you find in the MSM.But the beauty part is it's all that AND a breeze to read. And covers not just the usual political-media topics, but how media pervades how we live our lives in all the day-to-day banality.So, great beach reading AND you'll impress your summer dinner guests afterwards with your insights from this book..."
1,Stream-of-consciousness,"His fragmentary thoughts are difficult to follow. There is some wisdom here and there, but not worth the headache you'll get trying to decipher what is going on in his head. Here is an example:""If you say your own name to yourself at such a moment, it will seem utterly alien. You will then understand the sacrament of baptism."" Huh?At first, I thought his writing may just be over my head, but after re-reading most of it, I realized it was just bad. It's like the whole book was written when he was high or something. Some very good ideas, but most can be found in other, better written books."
2,In Love With His Own Words ...,"This is a tough book to critique b/c my law school recommended it. The author writes a well organized book, but every chapter has been padded -- chapters that could have been concisely written in 20 pages drag out to sixty. Buy this book only if you have to and read it only if you must. You aren't going to learn anything definitive from these chapters and all the practicing lawyers I run into think the authors ideas are just plain silly. The best way to teach about trial advocacy is to include REAL transcripts from REAL cases, not made up stories about fire trucks and people late for work. Those work great -- on paper. Plus the book never answers the big question -- what is the author's ACTUAL TRIAL EXPERIENCE?"
3,Hardly one of his best,"As a huge Steven Segal fan I find this review hard to write. This was a poorly done movie. Albeit it is possible, it is so unlikely that a person in a comma for 7 years will come out of it to begin with. It is even more unlikely that someone in a comma for 7 years will be able to mourne the death of his wife and the loss of his son in a matter of days and start a new romance with a new woman while trying to save his own life from those who tried to kill him in the first place. Granted that 7 years have passed, but to one in a comma for 7 years it wouldn't feel like 7 years, or probably 7 days for that matter.I was so dissapointed in the story. The acting was ok, but you could tell Mr. Segal's heart was not in this film."
5,Steve At His Finest!,This was definitely one of Steven Segal's finest films. Playing the role of a policeman Segal video tapes a crooked politician striking a deal with underworld elements. This causes hired killers to invade his home. This invasion causes the death of his wife and places our hero in a 7 year coma. His son is raised by a fellow policeman. Segal comes out of his coma and narrowily escapes being killed again. The pretty nurse takes him to an isolated retreat where he regains his health. The crooked politician has now become a U.S. Senator. Through the efforts of our hero the politician is brought down and our hero gains revenge. This is a must see video.
2,Average Follow-Up To 'Law',"Not-so-exciting revenge story starring the ego maniac Steven Seagal. I was upset after watching this one. Seagal's wife is killed and he's put in a coma after finding evidence to put away a local mayor. Almost 7 years pass and he awakes to the ""Weird Science"" chick. They beat up a ton of people at a ranch and he embarrasses the bad guy at the end. Typical action movie."
1,Ouch,"This movie hurts me to watch it. Steven Segal gets shot up, put in a coma, and then he goes off killing people for revenge. The action is really cheesy, the plot is awful, and the one liners make you want to shoot Segal. Steven Segal can't act.Notice how his movies all seem to have three words ""Above the Law"" ""Hard to Kill"" ""Straight to Video""....oops.There is a quote in this movie after Steven Segal shoots at a guy's crotch. ""I missed. I never miss. They must be smaller than I thought."" This line was a mess up, the correct line is: ""I missed. I always miss. I must be lamer than I thought.""If you wish to suck seven years off of your life, then go ahead, otehrwise steer clear."
2,Story and Action is Lacking,"This movie starts out well enough. The first fight scene is quick but entertaining. The plot thickens as his family is slain and he is in a coma, unbeknownst of the Bad guys (they think he died also). But while Seagal delivers a strong performance in a poorly directed movie, everything else crumbles. Le Brock, then married to Seagal, is poor as the nurse bringing Seagal back to health so he can clear his name and wallop the bad guys. Bill Sadler is OK as the sinister, power hungry senator, but the movies fight scenes are boring and people are knocked out in unrealistic fashion (a lot of Glass Jaw Joes in this film).Still, it is not a total disaster, if you have an hour and a half to kill; it beats any Seagal Movie besides Exit Wounds since 1997."
2,Hard to Watch...,"Don't get me wrong, I love these types of films but this one took WAY too long to get going. Once it did nothing great really happened. LOTS of broken wrists and arms but no really interesting action sequences. This director is no substitute for Andrew Davis. From what I've seen of Seagals movies, I rate Under Seige and Above the Law as his finest moments, and both were under the direction of Andrew Davis..."
3,"A fun action movie, certainly not Seagal's best.","This is a decent action flick. The plot is a little disjointed, but the action is mostly what one would want. I found Seagal's partner to be so over the top and sincere that I really liked him. Definitely not up to par with Under Siege, On Deadly Ground or any of those, but this is a pretty good 90 minutes."
3,i know that voice.,"the action and story line are good in this early seagal cop movie.after being shot and left in a coma for years,he escapes the hospital with the help of his nurse,after an assination attempt.after recovering,his goal is to bring to justice the people reponsible for the death of his wife.and to recover a hidden video tape involving corruption."
3,No classic,"This is no classic. Seagal plays a cop who after capturing a politician on film with some well known criminals becomes their target. He survives but his family do not. The rest you can guess. Having said its no classic, that is only by comparison to the very highest standards; as Seagal films go this is one of his best. He has ample opportunity to display his martial arts skills and it moves along with pace, and as its only just over an hour and a half long this means you won't be bored.However the script is pretty average, and as with a lot of Seagal films it has a made for TV feel about it which does it no favours. I certainly wouldn't recommend purchasing as I don't believe it will hold up to repeated viewings. See it once and enjoy it for what it is and move on!"
4,Its Hard to Kill Steven Seagull,"I liked this movie, Great Plot, Great movie, Great Setting.One of his best movies ever.Dont mess with Steven in the movie."
4,THE GOOD OL DAYS OF STEVEN SEAGAL,"AFTER SPENDING 7 YEARS IN A COMA, A COP [STEVEN SEAGAL] GOES AFTER SOME CORRUPT PEOPLE THAT KILLED HIS WIFE. THIS MOVIE SHOWS THE OLD STEVEN SEAGAL THAT ACTION FANS REMEMBER AND LOVE. THIS MOVIE HAS GOOD ACTION AND A LOT OF EXCITEMENT, WHICH IS MISSING FROM A LOT OF SEAGAL'S RECENT MOVIES. FOR FANS OF SEAGAL, THIS SHOULD BE A TRIP DOWN MEMORY LANE."
5,Rules NOT made to be broken,"With all due respect Mr Field says it right. And those who suggest that the current clutch of unproduced and unsold Writing Instructors who tell us that there are now not Beginning, Middle and End but everything BUT know what they are talking about are in for a rude shock. The rules Mr Field talks about in this excellent Video Course are right on and are the ones that SELLING screenwriters follow and that gave us the Golden Age of Hollywood. Do not let anyone give you guff to the contrary.If their advice resulted in salable screenplays they would be writing for Hollywood -- NOT vanity Webs!"
5,Motivational wisdom,"This all-inspiring book is wonderful. I literally could not put it down. The numerous quotes are worth the price of the book alone. Joan Lunden clearly cites ways to make the most out of your stressful day and end it with a smile. She motivates you to set goals for yourself and to go towards them with a ""you can do it attitude"". She emphasizes the hazards of living in the past and not in the present. She explores the importance of taking risks and accepting change. She provides an outstanding motivational voyage through life. A real 5-star adventure. The photographs in the book are an added treat.I recommend this book to anyone who wants to have a more enriching and fulfilling life."
2,"Me, Me, Me!","Well selected collection of quotations, excellent drawings; however the author has got a restricted and ego-centric view of life, people and the world. The example she gives to a stressful situation being a woman getting jealous of a friend who gets a diamond bracelet from her husband as a Valentine day present is the limit!"
5,Complex and riveting drama,"The perpetrators of a high-level corporate scandal (Masayuki Mori, Takashi Shimura, Ko Nishimura) are pursued by the illegitamate son (Toshiro Mifune) of a low-level functionary that they drove to suicide to protect their schemes. This film begins as a deeply satisfying revenge epic, but the masterful director Akira Kurosawa is not content to let it rest there. He draws out all the moral complexities of the situation, then hits us with an unexpected development at the end that gives an ironic twist to his title. The bad may not always go to prison for their crimes, but do they really ""sleep well?"""
4,Extensive Graduate Level Theology,"This is the most extensive theology from the REFORMED tradition in fairly recent times. Written by Charles Hodge, a professor at Princeton in the early 1900's, it is a scholarly presentation of the historic Christian faith. If you are looking for a deep analysis of doctrine, with consideration of the alternatives (Catholic, Orthodox, and Liberal) this is the book. Written at a Graduate level, I do not recommend it before studying college level theology. At least read Ryrie's ""Basic Theology"" (ISBN 089693814X) first. But for a really comprehensive study, this is the book."
5,soap,husband and oldest son watched when on television and often still imitate some of the characters. great gift. as everyone takes a chance watching it
5,Soap - The Complete 3rd Season,Love it! Love it! Love it! One of the funniest shows ever made for TV.
3,Damaged Product,I love this series!!! My only problem is that the outside cover binding had a huge cut right down the spine. Now this is not that big of a deal because the dvd's were not damaged but it is a little irratating that a product is delivered damaged. I still love Amazon.com and don't use anything else!!
4,Way before its time...,"Soap was a classic in every definition of the word. Awesome cast, witty writing and plots that never failed to entertain. My only qualm with this Season Set is the lack of extras. One of the previous releases (Season 1, I believe) had a very nice ""Making of"" sort of featurette with interviews with the creators, cast, etc. They gave the audience the impression there would be more of the same in future season releases, but that doesn't appear to be the case. I'm hoping they rectify this when they release the fourth and final season on DVD. I don't know about you, but I'd love a featurette where creator Susan Harris goes ahead and ties up all the loose ends left when ABC abruptly canceled the show in 1981."
1,A little hard for a begainner,"This is a rather low buget edcation dvd witch I found rather hard to falow. I recamend getting a live teacher, A dvd can only go so far."
4,forgotten album by Slade,"Well, it's sad this album is almost ""forgotten"" by Slade fans and no-fans alike, because Its their heavier record ever. Not a piece of clealry commercial music here, just straight ahead hard rock. Noddy Holder's vocals are aggressive and strong, the rest of the band is in an uncommon fast pace, and the album sounds fresh even nowadays. THis was their first RCA record, and I recommend it strongly."
3,They should have .........,"I got this CD for ONE SONG and it was an altenative cut of ""Love Me All The Way"". Same music track, but she's not pouring out her soul like she did on the single that was released. I'm dissapointed. The other songs are great but why muck up that song? Why do these companies put ""alternative"" cuts on these compilations. Just like Marvin Gaye's ""Stubborn Kinda Fella CD'. Pride & Joy is an alternative cut....that SUCKS.........................."
5,Wonderful music!,I make no claims to be musically sophisticated or all that knowledgeable about Jazz but Hot Club of San Francisco has become one of my very favorite musical groups and Yerba Buena Bounce is my favorite CD of their music.
1,Promise broken,"I complained about product misrepresentation (they are advertised as 3"" and are only 2-1/2""). They advised me they had been out of the 3"" at the time of the first shipment, but would send the correct ones and I could return the small ones. I've never received the replacements, and suspect they never had 3"" in stock."
2,Maybe a good first book,"Micke Spick's book was a disapointment. It is not very well researched and I found a lot of stories in it, which other books described better and more in depth. Some facts about the pilots are myths and have been shown to be wrong. The comments about the radar in the book are so brief that it gives you the wrong impression about the different approaches the germans and british had to this new technology. The tactics of the german pilots are only described briefly. Yes, we already know that the germans invented the ""rotte"" and the book goes tell you about ""schräge musik"", that the germans tried to shoot at very close range and so on and so on. There are no new facts in this book. For anyone who already read a few book about the airwar in europe, this book can't be recommended. It gets two stars because it is a fair introductory book at at low price."
2,"Sorry, no news here...","It seems like the author never took the time to do any research. Most of the information on tactics is either deducted from previously published pilot stories or based on common knowledge about the subject, and brings nothing new to the table. It's probably a good, cheap and readable book for the novice but borrows heavily from well known sources, making it a waste of money for the person who already has a few book on the subject."
3,ok book on the luftwaffe,"I read this book a number of years ago. It gives a very general description of the jagdflieger in world war two. I re-read this book because I recently became interested in ww2 flight simulators. I was trying to gain some tactical insight. While the book does provide some insight, it falls short in this regard. Though a well reseached work with personal interviews from the legendary german aces: Hartmann, Rall ect. It does not break any new ground."
4,good reading,"Rather intresting, but mostly thin on the story side, this book runs with the luftwafe, as it stormed europe, with detailed info. Would have been better, if explained some about the proffession of air war before telling us the numbers. you see, life isnt just numbers. still, fun reading."
5,A very detailed book covering some of the Luftwaffe's best!,"I found this book at the Grafenwoehr training area book store after coming out of a field exercise.This is where I first found out about Major Franz Eisenach who shot down 129 planes on the Eastern front.My mother's family name is Eisenach, and I'm trying to find out all I can about this man.This is where my research began, and it was a good start.If anyone is willing to share info. w/ me on this pilot I would appreciate it."
4,Great overall. Sound could be better.,"The picture is great if you have good cable. Sound is pretty good for a 20-inch. This set provides audio outputs to hook up to a stereo, which really helps the sound."
2,"Decent game, but could be better","I love Star Wars stuff.When I saw this game, I knew that I just had to have it. I was not expeting all that much, so I got what I expected.This review is for the Mac version of this game.The game is OK. Some challenges and some just really easy stuff. Interface is clunky and not as good as Starcrafts. Basically, just go and buy starcraft. It looks better and is more fun to play.Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds is a must for die hard Star Wars fans. But, if you are looking for a really fun game to play, try starcraft."
1,A fine game once - but it will not run on modern Macs,"This is a PowerPC game. Up through Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard), Intel Macs had ""Rosetta,"" a technology for running PowerPC binaries on Intel machines.Apple discontinued Rosetta in Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion), so there is not way to run this game (or any other PowerPC binaries) without emulating earlier versions of Mac OS X, or booting an earlier version on your Mac (which might not be possible with machines released after Lion). So do not buy it unless you are familiar with these issues.Caveat Emptor."
3,So and so...,I got this game a couple of days ago. Basically each civilization gets about 20 similar units. You have to chop trees to harvest carbon and mining for ores and crystals. Those are your basic requirements. I finished the training missions and didn't get very far (only on level 3 of the Trade Federation). I am playing on the hard level of difficulty. I can say it takes forever to finish. The units move kind of slowly and clumsily and the game drags on forever. Very often the CPI units are behind laser turrets which are in turn under the cover of a shield generator. Penetrating that was difficult. The ranged units are pretty much useless against structures. Have to rely upon melee attack. I don't know whether I will ever finish this game. Got to get a life as well.......
5,Good for both the practicing and the student engineer,"I found this handbook a good information sourcebook in my undergraduate and graduate engineering education. It worked best once I'd seen the material in my class textbook. On the job, I find this handbook invaluable for most engineering disciplines involving physical system analysis. It is one of my favorite books. The next edition (4th) is larger, heavier, and somehow, not as interesting. The magic is in this 3rd edition."
5,Outstanding,"If you purchase only a single engineering reference work this year, purchase this one. It contains the essentials you need to design nearly anything."
3,Better in concept than reality...,"I really respect the concept behind this record, and some of the versions on here are kind of interesting (particularly the Portishead-like ""Chain of Fools""). But I doubt I'll listen to it more than a couple of times. It just somehow doesn't seem to work all that well."
5,GOT MORE THAN EXPECTED,"Really just wanted to turn back time to when I read Civil Disobedience and Waldens Pond back in high school. Wound up getting a wonderful anthology of Thoreau that has taken a prominent place in my life again. The ""portable"" part should come with a disclaimer; I can barely cram it into my coat pocket and it lQQks rather odd tucked into my waistband.He still makes so much sense, and yet, the mainstream folks will never buy into his straight forward sensibility. He threatens their power structure built on taxes and politics, so his ideas will never fly.Damn glad to have the book though!It's a keeper!"
2,A tangled mess,"This is one of the least inspired and entertaining mysteries I've encountered in years. The plot is ridiculously complex (and silly), the camera work is irritating, the hero is a raunchy oaf, and the writer has badly confused Anglo-Catholicism with Catholicism in his portrayal of an English church. Even the quality of the picture is not that great. Stay away from this one."
3,Good Buy But...,"I did not receive the travel case, which was a main reason I chose this jewelry box. But the jewelry box is pretty with many different storages for all types of jewelry."
2,I should have known better,"Not the first time I've read an anthology with stories by authors I love - for their full-length novels. Not the first time I've been sorry about it. It's a real challenge to write a stand-alone story about a character with 3 novels out there - and a novella has very different pacing demands from a full-length. Anyway, if you've read the Walker papers, you'll find Banshee Cries duplicates an awful lot of explanations (with the identical same phrases, which really gets my goat, did she just use generic fill material?) Oh well, I'll stick to the novels (which are really, really excellent and you should go and buy any full length by C.E Murphy right now; you'll thank me.)"
3,3 Stars.,"Torn between duty to her father or to her king, a woman choses a third option in Mercedes Lackey's Moontide, and learns to listen to the wisdom of a fool. Heart of the Moon, by Tanith Lee finds two souls on a quest for love and truth that challenges all they believe and dares them to change their lives. C E Murphy returns to her shaman's world in Banshee's Cry, where Joanne Walker is forced to again take up the mantle of destiny to solve a case, calling upon powers she hates using to do the good she needs to do.*** Though all of the stories are really to brief to truly develop, fans of these writers will enjoy them. The three stories are nothing alike, so could well appeal to three very different types of readers. ***Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, Freelance Reviewer."
2,Buy it when the used books come out,"The story by Mercedes Lackey was written at the age 13 and below level. Very juvenile and predictable, and about on a par with her Gryphon series, particularly the second and third book. I felt as if she was just hacking the story out to have something to offer during this time period. Her characters were way too wooden and without interest. The other two stories by Tanith Lee and C.E. Murphy failed to hold my interest past the first three or four pages, and I'd have a hard time telling you what they were about. This just isn't worth the money."
2,Not the Best Grisham,"The book tells a good story, with some thrilling parts. However, don't expect ""The Runaway Jury"", ""The Firm"" or ""The Pelican Brief"". This book is nowhere close to the quality of Grisham's other books. Most of the story is uneventful, without the action levels we are used to."
1,The Well is Bone Dry,"I have read 12 of Grisham's 17 novels. He truly gave the best of himself at the beginning of his writing career and has been on a downhill slide ever since. He used to write books that I literally could not put down. I had to force myself to finish this book. It had none of the page-turning, pulse-pounding suspense of his earlier books. It was just...boring. On top of that I found it to be sloppy, too. There were times when he told us (again) what he had just told us 2 pages earlier. Whoever edited this book also missed several mistakes (Miss Callie would have counted!)Want good Grisham? Go back and just reread his older stuff because he's obviously not going to give us anything new that comes anywhere near his earlier books. If you're dead set of reading this, check it out from the library. Don't waste money on it."
1,Worst Grisham Ever,"This is by far the worst ever Grisham book. It is like no other Grisham, in that there is barely any courtroom action. The chapters seem thrown together, and NOTHING happens. The only reason I kept reading was to see if anything would develop. Read any other Grisham."
1,COULD NOT WAIT TO PUT IT DOWN,"MY WIFE READ IT, SAID IT WAS OK. SHE AND I HAVE READ EVERY GRISHAM BOOK AND LIKED MOST. THIS BOOK BORED ME TO TEARS. IF IT WAS 10 CHAPTERS INSTEAD OF 40 PLUS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A GOOD SHORT STORY. DONT BUY IT, BORROW IT IF YOU MUST READ THE LATEST GRISHAM."
1,Worst Ever?,"I thought after the very weak effort on Bleachers he would bounce back with one of his best efforts. WRONG! Don't waste your money, reading this book is less exciting than listening to Nora Jones."
2,"Good, But mine is better","John Grisham may well be the very best author working in the U.S. today. Let's just get that out of the way up front, since everyone seems to repeat it ad nasuem. He's one of the greats- and, unlike many lesser authors, his creativity has not dried up over all these years.But having dabbled in fictional writing myself, I came up with roughly the same storyline as this book. While I didn't complete a manuscript, I did manage to get a few chapters (as well as a complete outline... hmmmmm...) to several publishers. Oh, and before I forget to specify, this was all more than 3 years ago.So it goes without saying that I was loathe to finish reading this book, and my opinion remains somewhat biased. Of course I love the story- but I loved it more when I was telling it! Please keep in mind, I'm not making any accusations."
2,The Last Juror,"I am a huge fan of John Grisham, have read all of his books, but I have to admit, I have been disappointed with his last few books and The Last Juror takes the cake in that department. It has a great plot, but Mr. Grisham goes no where with it. It starts off very strong, but half way through and all the way to the end, it is awful. I found myself skimming through the pages asking myself ""what in the world does this have to do with the story?"". Any Grisham fan out there should read it just to read it, but do not expect anything that Grisham's potential has to offer."
3,"Starts out sizzling, but dies down","The Last Juror starts out really well keeping your interest up for the first half, but as part two begins it really starts to loose it's thrill and become a different type of story. I would recommend this book, but would not say it's one of my favorite Grisham novels. The one thing that I really like about his writing style is how well you can picture the characters of his book in your mind. Also, being from Mississippi I always enjoy the mentioning of towns and counties that I know...makes it a little more ""real"" I guess. I do wish it had a little more ""thrill"" to it, especially in the end."
2,couldn't even finish it,"I'm a big fan of John Grisham early works... Runaway Jury, Time to Kill etc. But this story and The Summons sucked. I read the The Summons all the way through and I never felt the suspense and after I got to the ending I felt stupid for forcing myself through the book. This story I decided not to even finish. The stories susposed to be about a man coming back and killing the jurors after he gets out of the jail. So I'm thinking that theres going to be about a 100 or so pages leading up to the man getting out of jail then there would be the killings. I got over halfway through the book which was very boring and I was still reading about the time surrounding the trial. I couldn't figure out the point of all this extra info. So I gave up. Don't waste your time if you're a fan of the early John Grisham."
1,What was he thinking?,"I was extremely disappointed with the entire book. I forced myself to finish it, hoping it might get better. I found myself skipping entire paragraphs and missing nothing in the process. The characters are all completely forgettable, and so is the story. The end was predictable, and any moron could have guessed why the jurors were being eliminated.Please don't write another book, Mr. Grisham.This was a complete waste of time."
2,Is that all there is?,"John Grisham's books tend to be easy to read. Unfortunately, his latest books do not live up to ""The Firm"" or ""The Client."" The plot of ""The Last Juror"" was so simple that it didn't take a rocket scientist to guess what would happen next. That isn't necessarily a bad thing, but this story line left you feeling unsatisified. I compare it to going to a great restaurant and not getting enough to eat. After plowing through 355 pages, you are left with a ""is that it?"" reaction. The ending wasn't enough to make you feel full when you left the table."
2,Disappointment,"Grisham disappoints the reader in this drab novel. Too many inconsequential characters, which makes the book choppy to read. Granted, a surprize ending, but not enough to propel the novel into a mediocre book."
2,Disappointing,This book was a nice narrative but you can clearly see how the marketing folks got a hold of it and tried to sell it as a thriller. It isn't one.
1,Not your usual John Grisham book!!,"I was very disappointed with this book, in that it did not follow his usual genre. I did not read reviews ahead of time or I would not have purchased the book. I am an avid reader of his books and buy them as soon as they are on the market. The jacket of the book was very misleading. I kept waiting for the trial to be over so we could get on with the riveting story of the revenge issue. It never got off the ground. I almost did not finish the book. The redeeming factor in the book is the relationship with the last juror, which was the whole point of the book. It should have been advertised that way on the book jacket."
4,A Great Small Town Story of truth and justice,I thought this story of the little Southern town; its small town newspaper owner and its citizens was just a super read. I enjoyed the world of Willie as he became more known by the folks of this Mississippi hamlet. Mr. Crisham did an excellent jobe of developing his character in such a way that I couldn't help but read page after page wondering what adventure he would stumble into. Without hesitation I would recommend this book to all my friends.
3,The Last Juror,"I didn't connect with any of the characters like I normally do in a Grisham book. I am a big fan of his and let's be upfront here, I feel he is one of the best writers around. The book centers around a young newspaper editor in Clanton, Mississippi during the 1970's. Rather than a murder mystery or a legal suspense book, it is a story about a small southern town dealing with the issues of the day, including Vietnam and desegregation. The murder and trial are only a very small part of the actual plot. Don't expect to have a big surprise at the end. It wasn't a bad book for me but it wasn't the legal thriller I was looking for either."
2,The Last Juror is a sure miss!,"It's been awhile since I read a John Grisham novel because I'm not a big fan of contemporary writing. However, after reading the dust cover of The Last Juror, I was hooked. I braced myself for a thriller reminscent of A Time to Kill (after all both books were set in the same small Mississippi town). I was sorely disappointed. Grisham tosses in almost everything but the kitchen sink in this novel as he waxes poetic on small town life in Mississippi, the evils of Wal-Mart, and the wonders of Southern cooking. This is a great sentimental novel but as a thriller it lacks punch."
1,Where is the plot?,"I have always been a fan of John Grisham's writing, defending him in the face of my intellectual friends who consider him to be formulaic and predictable. My response has always been, ""Who cares, as long as he keeps writing books with such scintillating plots and characters?""But this latest offering is a bitter disappointment. The pace is plodding and never amounts to anything: no suspense, no drama, not even an interesting string of events. The characters are nothing but cardboard cut-outs. The book reads like a boring photo album, with quick descriptions penned on the back of each picture. The most telling sign is the utter lack of emotional depth, especially when this book is apparently supposed to be a heartwarming tribute to Grisham's somewhat idealized memories of the Deep South.I kept reading this book until the bitter end, convinced that Grisham was going to turn things around. He doesn't. Skip this turkey and save yourself the time and aggravation."
3,A 200 Page Novel Stretched Out To 400 + Pages,"I love Grisham. I've read every one of his legal novels. I'm not sure what this was. Of course, he always writes well. But this was a meandering discourse on life in the old south as it meets the New South. The crime and trial were a mechanism to muse on the old south and its colorful characters and folkways. OK if that's what you want. Great descriptions of southern cooking and answers the question as to why there is more obesity in the south."
1,boring,I took this book on vacation expecting a great read and it turned out to be a boring tedious read. If not for the Grisham name this book would not be on any best seller list. Reading this book was a chore not a pleasure. I finished the book and was still waiting for something to happen. Dont waste your time
3,The Outsider Gains Acceptance!,"Of the 3 Grisham novels i have read, this one seems totally out of Sync. Theres no fast paced city law firms but instead the slow relaxing pace of Deep South. Although the pace of the book will make it difficult for many readers to read ""just one more chapter"" before bed, the book still has its place.The deep and detailed characterisation allowed me to bond with the William and those he was closest to, which unwittingly had me rooting for a happy ending. Grisham, details every facet of being part of a small community so that by the time the ending comes the reader feels like they are part of it.The book starts from an outsiders point of view and over each page i became engrossed in the simple lives of those involved in the towns small drama's, and was able to see things through the eyes of William as he tries to blend in.An interesting read, with a bitter sweet conclusion!"
3,The Last Juror,"Good read. Little slow throughout, but an interesting story. Great description of locale. I would recommend this book to readers who enjoy historical novels."
3,"easy to figure out, but still a good read","I was hoping for another sleepless night poring over the pages of my latest purchase - alas, I just knew from the title title that JG was back in the saddle and about to hand us another heart-stopping,suspense-filled saga. NOT SO...(although my review of the book is delayed, I did buy it on the release date).I enjoyed the lead characters way of gradually ""finding his space"" among the ""regulars"", but the storyline was VERY predictable.I won't tell (I hate when people spoil the ending!!!) who the killer is, but JG gave a hint of some of the vintage Grisham stuff to which we've grown accustomed. Read this book or watch American Idol, both will probably conjure up the same emotions."
5,What a book!,"As usual, Grisham doesn't disappoint, whether it's a legally-based thriller, a down-home ""Painted House"" or any of his other great reads. At least there's some consistancy in this world. Also liked ""The Firm,"" ""Bark of the Dogwood,"" ""A Child called It."""
1,The worst I have ever read !!!,This has been the worst book from Grisham than I have ever read. It was a waisting time. Page after page I was expecting things change or come better but at the end I was dissapointed with this book. I should read the amazon rate before buy this book. I'll do next time.
1,Spare me,"The first Grisham I read was The Partner. I loved it and proceeded to plow through every one of his books. In the last five to six years, save The Brethren, his books have become nothing more than essays that go nowhere. After now having read The Broker and The Last Juror (both having only the thinest of plots- if they can be called plots) I can confidently say I would only buy another Grisham if all the book stores and publishers in the world burned down and someone was giving one away. You may think I'm being harsh, but I get the feeling Grisham's heart is no longer in it and he is only writing for his publisher and hip pocket now."
3,"A few incorrect facts here and there, but interesting book","Book is intriguing enough to keep you interest like any other John Grisham movie. Can't remember all the mistakes, but one that stands out is his mention of 9mm ""Glock"" pistol collection of Harry Rex, but Glock was introduced in US in the early 80s. I guess everyone that isn't familiar with firearm history is just happy to mention the Glock pistol name to fill some pages.There are some more, but I am surprised that John Grisham has failed to perform this simple research."
2,Not Grisham's Finest,"Usually John Grisham's books are a pageturner. Unfourtantly, The Last Juror is not one of those. I'm not even sure what the title is refering to. The first half of the book starts out strong but the 2nd and 3rd parts are weak. Parts of the book talks about Danny Padgitt but once the trial ends, it seems like Grisham is just filling paper to get a full length novel. There are even parts of the book where it's just gibberish. In fact, some things don't belong here.Last time Grisham visited Ford County was in the book A Time to Kill and that was 10 times better then The Last Juror as it had was filled with suspense and mystery but in The Last Juror, there's none of that. I like Grisham's past books but this one falls flat throughout."
3,"Not bad, but misleading","I agree with many of the comments that indicat ethis is a relatively good book, even if it varies greatly from previous Grisham novels oin terms of pace, plots, etc. What bothers me is the book cover sells it as another Grisham novel. Mostly it sells the murder, his statement to the jury, that he has been released and there is revenge. I purchased the book based on wanting an action novel. Weeks later, it is nothing more than a well-written account of a newspaper editor making commentaries on coming of age in the south. Nothing wrong with it, but don't bait-and-switch the reader as to thinking it is a ""typical"" Grisham novel"
5,A great read,"The characters in the book are ones I couldn't get enough of. This may be John Grisham's finest work to date. The suspense is intense and the setting is another great tribute as with A Time to Kill, set in Mississippi. Don't miss this one. Grisham fans will love it, and if you're new to John Grisham, you will be hooked! Another book that I highly recommend is ""He Never Called Again."""
3,An OK Read.,"I was disappointed in this latest book. I was exited to hear it was taking place in Canton & the story sounded great but somewhere along the line the book just didn't prove to be what it could have been. Where is the John Grisham of ""A Time to Kill"" or The Painted House?"" It was still a good read just because John Grisham wrote it."
2,Very Slow Read... A far departure from his first books,"I used to be an avid John Grisham fan. I would anxiously wait for his books to come out and be one of the first to purchase a book. Lately, his books have strayed and have not caught my interest. This book sounded like it could be in line with his first books, so I was anxious to read it. I can usually finish a Grisham book in less than a day... this one dragged for about a week. I forced myself to finish it so I could start a new book. The main character is not very interesting and it makes it hard to feel any involvement in the choices he makes in his life. If John Grisham continue the same trend, I will have to find a new author to enjoy."
4,A Yankee Comes to Clanton,"Great book. Indeed the story is about the town of Clanton,Mississippi seen through the eyes of a liberal Yankee newspaper editor. You'll enjoy reading the book if you like reading about small town Southern culture. Not Grisham's very best but still a very good book. He does well painting pictures of small town life and the dynamics among the groups in those towns. Keep it up Grisham!"
4,Good book.,For the most part a very enjoyable read. There were parts that were a little slow but overall I enjoyed the book. Great ending.
2,excellent detective story trying to get out of boring novel,"At the heart of the book is an excellent detective story of perhaps 100 pages which matches the better pieces of Agatha Christie. The trouble is that Grisham padded it out to a full-scale novel by throwing in everything but the kitchen sink: Missipppi corrupt politics, black history and cooking, the Viet Nam war, and so on. There should be a law against such blatant padding!"
4,very pleased with purchase,i was very pleased with this purchase. it came exactly as the seller described and in the same time frame as advertised. i would definitely order from this vendor again.
2,If You Want to Read About Small Town Living,"At first, The Last Juror held my interest like most of Grisham's books do. After the murder trial, which takes place very quickly, the book begins to sag. It becomes a diary of small-town living as seen through the eyes of city slicker Willie Traynor and doesn't pick up much again. What a disappointment."
3,Stereotypical!,"A pleasant and easy to read story with the obligatory bad local boy, poor black matriarch with the wisdom of Solomon and all her children having become professionals, the initially distrusted ""Northerner"" from Tennessee, the drunk who can write a good story, and the former reporter, an eccentric who had a thing about obituaries. Oh, yes, the protagonist also has a strange and unlikable father and a sense of idealism. Despite the insistence on these stereotypes, it was a worthwhile read."
2,Just not what I expect from Grisham,"Ok I am not saying this is a bad book - it does hold your attention and there is a little twist at the end but it is just not what I have come to expect from Grisham. I expect more law talk, suspense and action - this bordered on Chick Lit. There is nothing wrong with talking about people's feelings but that should be in a book by Danielle Steele not Grisham."
3,"OK, But not his best work","This book is plainly a good read when nothing else is available. It is OK, but do not expect the ""action"" that was present in earlier novels by Mr. Grisham. I felt as though the book lacked something but I can't quite put my finger on it."
2,bad,"I enjoy Grisham. The man can tell a story! But this time, it was a slow, boring story. This is even worse than Bleachers. It's predictable, it's uneventful,.....Very disappointing."
4,"Good, but for a Grisham book?","I'll be honest, this is the first Grisham book I've read. I though it was a great book, as far as a novel depicting a character and a town, and the changes that both go through over time. However, it wasn't what I expected with my first Grisham novel. The main point of the book was not the murder which happens in the first 20 pages. I will make this comparison: If the film ""A Time To Kill"" is an exact representatin of the book, and you enjoyed reading the book, then ""The Last Juror"" is one you want to stay away from"
4,"Not terribly suspenseful, but a good read","This is not your typical Grisham novel as it's set over a period of 9 years. It could have used a little more character development and a little more suspense, but overall it was an interesting read. Grisham does a good job of creating a believable setting and picks interesting story lines to follow. Worth the read."
2,Boring!,"I kept waiting for the story to start, but it never did. I hung in there, thinking that eventually something was going to happen. Even when there was a ripple of an event, it was written about in an uninteresting way. No suspence, no intrigue, just a waste of time in my opinion."
2,sleepy time,"I must admit that I fell asleep often while reading this book... which is rare because John Grisham usually keeps me up all night with his usual page turners. I thought this would be a come back after ""Bleachers"", which bored me to tears, but I was sadly mistaken. Can we please see more of the old ""John Grisham"" next time?"
3,Marginal,"This isn't one of Grisham's best, but it did keep my attention. It does start out slow, but Grisham does a good job of making you sympathize with his characters"
4,"Good, But not Great","Grisham's latest book is suspenseful and filled with memorable characters. Unlike his other legal thrillers, this one only has a few court scenes. It is about Willie Traynor, a college dropout who buys a local newspaper. A terrible murder occurs in the town and Willie covers it in his newspaper. The murderer threatens to seek revenge on the jury that convicts him. The plot continues as Padgitt, the murderer is released from prison. The jurors begin to die, one by one. Overall, this novel is adequate, but not nearly as exciting or intriguing as Grisham's early works. The unique characters such as Miss Callie, and her family make the novel worthwhile."
3,Grisham does ok with this one,"Grisham is a pretty good novelist, and I've read some other stuff, but I was a little disappointed with this one. It seems to drag on a bit and the ending is a bit predictable.wwr@virginia.edu"
2,"Grisham's not so stunning ""comeback""","This having been his first legal thriller in a couple years, I was not completely impressed by the movement or character development in this book. I have read all of Grisham's books and would easily place this near the bottom of the list.The initial concept is interesting, but his storytelling was lackluster and characters a bit cliched.I kept thinking the ""crime family"" resembled the Clampetts and his protaganist was unbelievable at times. A lot of the characters were shallow, and the end was disappointing.If you are going to read this, wait for the paperback or get it from the library.Or just re-read the good ones: A Time to Kill, The Client, The Brethren and The Pelican Brief."
2,"Fast reading, barely worth it","Several good court scenes are not enough to salvage this book, as Grisham stretches the plot needlessly through page after page. Actually, although this book is fast-enough reading, you can get through it even faster by checking out the plot summary on the dust jacket. It takes you up to page 291 (out of about 370). Even then, the ending is rather anticlimactic.Hard-core Grisham fans, wanting to preserve their record of reading everything he's written, will have a reason to read this book. The rest of us can surely find better ways to spend even the short time needed to read it."
1,Bait and Switch,"Thought it would be another great courtroom thriller like Runaway Jury or The Partner. Instead, it's a long winded, wandering human interest story."
2,"""Honey, can you write another book? The bank account is low""","About halfway through this book I turned to the front and counted how many books the author had already written before this one...16. So this is his 17th novel. Like many other reviewers, my overall criticism is there is a lot of padding or ""fill"". I have no idea, but it seems like the motivation to write this book might have been low and he just wasn't focused on how this novel was going to turn out."
3,cheap trick at the ending,"I really wanted to love this...his books are usually so good. The beginning started off great, just like his old thrillers. Then the middle third drifted off into character portraits. But the ending....SPOILER ALERT....blaming violent crimes on a mentally ill man?? Cheap trick."
2,A very boring book,"I LOVE John Grisham. I have read almost all his books, but this one.... I couldn't even read beyond the first hundred pages. It is so slow, a lot of narrative. It looks more like a history book than a thriller one. I didn't like at all."
2,Not his best work by any stretch........,"If you like the Grisham novels where it's non-stop action and suspense all the way through the novel, this book is NOT for you. It is not even close to his other jury titled book ""The Runaway Jury."" This books is very slow and the real mystery only begins in the last 50 pages. Up to that point, it is very slow and actually boring. Quite a drop-off from Grisham's usually high standards in my opinion"
4,A Suspenseful Glimpse of Small Town Mississippi In The 1970',"Willie Traynor, a 23 years old, just out of college, sort of a long haired ivy league radical, comes South to find himself. He ends up greatly maturing as he becomes a newspaper reporter and then owner of the Ford County Times,a small circulation local paper which he builds up and ultimately sells for $1.5 million. Along the way there's plenty of excitement. The son of a wealthy family brutally rapes and murders an attractive young widow. When he's sentenced to prison he threatens to kill the jurors who put him away. When he's ultimately paroled the killings start. It's thought that he's the perpetrator. But it turns out that he wasn't. It was a deranged assistant prosecutor. Who shoots Danny Padgitt at a bail hearing after he was arrested as a suspect in the murders of three of the jurors who had voted against the deathy penalty. Plenty of interesting turns and twists in this story."
3,kevin's brilliant insight,"Starting out, the book was pretty good. It caught you right away with the murder scene. I was hooked for a while... The book lost me, though, somewhere in the endless pages describing every different church imaginable. I felt like I knew all the characters pretty well, but I think a lot of it was unneccesary and just made the book kind of dry and boring in spots. Overall I think the book was pretty good. It could have been better though. Throughout the entire book it seems like you're getting set up for some huge dramatic ending. That dramatic ending never comes."
2,The Man has lost it,"I am still a big fan of Grisham's earlier books, especially Pelican Brief, but I think he's run out of ideas. The Last Juror is tired, boring, derivative and a waste of time."
2,Those were the days,"Kind of reminds me of a good ol' boy talking about the ol' days and oh, by the way, let's throw about 4 pages of story into all the reminiscing."
3,"Title is misleading, story is fair-to-good","The title completely makes no sense although there is a jury that is a major part of this story. Anyway, I enjoyed it better than some reviewers here but I do think the story had more potential. Spoiler alert follows (don't read until you've read the book or decided not to): Wouldn't it have been FAR better to make the killer the sister of the murdered woman, the sister who visited the newspaper man during the trial?"
2,What a disappointment!,"John Grisham should stop churning out a book a year and focus on regaining the skills he had when he wrote A TIME TO KILL. Each ""novel"" has become progressively less satifying. I barely skimmed the last hundred pages of THE LAST JUROR.That's it for me with Grisham books."
1,This Book SUCKED!!!,"I was convinced by a friend to start reading books from John Grisham. I haven't read that many, but this one was AWEFUL. It was sooo drawn out, and basically a waste of my time.However, I must say that I liked ""The Summons"", ""The Testament"", and so far I'm liking ""The King of Torts."""
1,didn't like it at all,"This was so boring. There was too much emphasis on secondary characters, not enough on the plot. I was very disappointed."
1,Who are you and what have you done with Grisham?,"I was disappointed with Grisham's latest book, The Last Juror. The book slowly plodded along with no real direction. Not much a story: 25-year-old Willie buys a small-town newspaper and writes about the townsfolk. A man, Padgitt, kills and rapes a woman. Man is not sentenced to death penalty because of a hung jury. Newspaper sales go up. Willie befriends an older black woman, writes about her family, has lunch with her every Thursday. 10 years later, Padgitt is released from jail. Willie sells the newspaper. Black woman dies of heart attack. The end. Come on!!! This book was awful.Like most readers, I read for fun. This book was not fun. What happened to the Grisham who wrote simple-minded, super-fast reads such as The Rainmaker, The Client and The Firm?"
2,Have I read this somewhere before?,"I am from Mississippi and went to school at Ole Miss, so, I am supposed to love John Grisham's books. I used not be able to wait until the next book came out.I find his books to all be cut from the same cloth. What happened to the great suspense books like The Firm and The Pelican Brief? It seems to me that Mr. Grisham is losing his passion for writing. Much like the main character in this book, I think that Mr. Grisham is just trying to produce a story fast enough to meet a deadline set by his publisher and just good enough to pass the minimum requirements needed to sell a few copies.In a nutshell, Mr. Grisham's books are becoming steadily worse. My advice--don't waste your time reading this book."
1,Not one of his best........boring,"I am a big John Grisham fan and have read all his books. I think I only read them out of habit now because I have not enjoyed the last few. This was one of the most boring books I have read in a long time. I think John Grisham should take a few years off and then maybe he would be able to write like he did 10 years ago. I plodded through this book hoping it would get better, not really caring about the characters and finding it very predictable. It never did get better but it did end!"
2,Not My Cup of Tea,"For a John Grisham book, I was a bit disappointed with the writing style. It took me at least 100 pages to become remotely interested and even then I still wanted to put it down. The storyline seemed interesting enough: In 1970, one of Mississippi's more colorful weekly newspapers, The Ford County Times, went bankrupt until a young mother was brutally raped and murdered by a member of the notorious Padgitt family. After being sentenced to ""life"" in prison, ""life"" in Mississippi doesn't really mean ""life in prison"". It seemed like it would be an amazing thriller but quite honestly it was a slow and boring read."
2,For a couple pleasant afternoons in Summer,"After I have read this book, I had the feeling to be in Southern, with its hot and humidity, but I had preferred a different story to spend my holidays. The title is not what you expect, because there is a trial, yes, and a jury, yes, but is a small part of the book. While you are reading The Last Juror, you are learning how was the life in Claton (Miss) and how a 21 years old, can run a paper with a loan from his grandma.The book is as reading obituaries, nice ones, but no more."
2,fast to slow page turner,I've enjoyed a few Grisham novels but this one fell mostly flat for this reader. I guess I prefer the fast paced legal action thrillers that he is known for. It started out great with a horrific murder and dramatic small-town trial but detoured quickly into a commentary of life in Mississippi in the 70's which made it a slow page turner for me.
4,Grisham scores hit with a journalism story..,Fresh plot makes for good reading without Grisham's usual quirky legal setup. Enjoyed characters and unpredictable ending.
2,A light skim,Not really the author's meatiest books and it doesnt really present a 'page turner' feel to it. I found myself bored thru parts of this book. Its a decent read but not a winner.
4,Amazing,This is the first time I have read a book by John Grisham and I think that this one was AMAZING. It takes you on a wild adventure from the eyes of a newspaper owner by the name of William Traynor. He winds up meeting new friends Miss Callie and Harry Hex. As a murder unfolds in this town he must recount all the news and other things going on in the town. But soon the jurors are all dying one by one by an anyonimous killer. Now he has to cope with more murders and the saftey of his friends. I think that this is a great book and I would recomend it to anyone in the feeling for an exciting book full of murder and deseption.
2,WEAK,This was a first. I enjoy Grisham's books. But this one fell off hard. Perhaps at 1/3 its length it probably would have held together. It's stretched way too far. I finally quite halfway. Not unpleasant. Just mind-boggingly slow. He's not a deep writer. If he doesn't keep it moving everybody's in trouble. Way slow. Only have so much time in this world.
3,Sat on my shelf a long time,"Don't know why I waited so long to read this book. It is a very different story from Grisham. The pace is slower, maybe a bit too slow here and there. But for the most part, a good read. It was interesting watching Willie, as a 23 year old, becoming an owner/publisher, and then seeing how he matured over the years. It was also interesting having a story set in the 1970's during Vietnam, and set in the South, with such a huge gap between whites and blacks, but changing for the better as the story progressed. The pacing may be too slow for some readers, but for me, it was a good story."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this book because the synopsis sounded good and because I knew John Grisham had a reputation of being a great author of suspense novels. This book was ok, but just ok. There wasn't any suspense that I could see, and it wasn't the type of book I couldn't put down. It was just a nice little tale of a town and it's people. Not a typical Grisham novel."
2,"Historical Fiction, not legal suspense","In this novel John Grisham has created an in depth and fascinating study of a small southern town and all its characters, tracking their growth and development over time. He details food, customs, race relations and politics. However, that is most definitely not what I wanted from a Grisham novel with a legal title. I wanted suspense and thrill. This dragged on with Michner-like detail providing occasional clues to the secondary legal plot while chronicling history. The denoument was highly anticlimactic. Read it for lovely historical fiction, but not if you want hardhitting, riveting thrilling suspense."
3,"Typical Grisham, good, but could have been great....","I often wonder if John Grisham didn't write such a good first 3 books, would he be nearly as popular as he is now. He is a good writer, his books flow, they are easy to read, but they just end....I often find myself saying, a book was way too long, I find his too short....This was a good story, well developed, that ended in 2 pages....Maybe that is what keeps his books alive, they are all fast paced and build, I just wish the endings would develop also. I liked The Last Juror, it was good, but I wonder, could it have been great?"
3,"A Nice, Meandering Story","No suspense at all in this book... it's a wandering tale of life in a small Southern town. The author meanders through 9 years of this and that, finally wrapping up with a touching ending. A nice story, more in the style of Eudora Welty than a murder mystery or suspense novel. The characters are memorable and nicely written, but all through the volume I kept wondering where it was going. I enjoyed it, but I'm notoriously easy to please."
3,A different Grisham legal,"While this book is expertly written, I was, I have to admit, a bit disappointed with it in the end. I may be fickle, but I like a good fast paced legal book, and this book was advertised similarly to his previous books. So, I was a bit disappointed that this book was a slower paced book that really had more to do with life in this small town than the legal heroics of the situation. I suppose I pre-prejudiced myself against this book, thinking it would be similar to his previous ones. It is a very well written book, and interesting to boot. The characters in the book, especially Willie Traynor, are well developed and cleverly written. Recommend it as a good read, just don't come into it with any pre-conceived notions!"
4,The best Grisham book I have so far read,"This was the first Grisham book I ever read, and I have since read two others, The Firm and The Street Lawyer. The Last Juror has really engaging characters, a likable narrative voice, and a meaningful story that seems realistic and held my interest all the way. This is very good, carefully crafted writing throughout. Unfortunately, The Grisham books I read afterwards are linear, one-dimensional, boring, and give the impression of being carelessly written. The Last Juror is several cuts above the usual Grisham fare, if Street Lawyer and The Firm are any indication."
4,Another fine Grisham book,"I just finished reading this book and I cant understand why so many people gave it bad reviews. I thought it was an excellent book. Willie was great and all the characters of Ford county were interesting to say the least. Grisham once again shows how talented of a story teller he is. Who couldnt like Baggy, Harry Rex, Miss Callie and her huge family and everyone else. I felt this book to be just as good as Grishams other novels that I have read (The Brethren, The partner, The Last Testament, King of Torts, ect.). Once again Grisham delivers with your not so typical lawyer book, and does a great job. A small town feel with lots of drama I recommend this book to any Grisham fan."
1,One of his worst...,"I am surprised to see so many positive reviews here. The books started off wonderfully, with an interesting protagonist and fabulous details of life in a small town in the 70s. The murder and subsequent trial was also great, and the suspense that this all set up was good too.Then, the story pretty much stopped moving. Grisham got into painful details - scenes that had almost nothing (and I'm being generous) to do with moving the plot. I kept reading because I couldn't imagine he could do this... it had to pick up again somewhere, didn't it?Sadly, no. The last few pages got back into the drama, but the story ended with a neat excuse for real closure. Too simple, too convenient.Someone described this book as ""literary."" I don't see it, sorry. Grisham is one hell of a story-teller. He's got a great imagination. I imagine this is one of those books that ""by contract"" had to be finished according to some publisher's schedule. Too bad."
1,Not much here?,"This was my first Grsham and I was extremely disappointed with the entire book. I forced myself to finish it, hoping it might get better. I found myself skipping entire paragraphs and missing nothing in the process. The characters are all completely forgettable, and so is the story. The end was predictable, and it was plain to see why the jurors were being eliminated. Maybe I should give his early books a try but so far I am not impressed."
1,tame and lacklustre,"I was thoroughly disappointed. Although Grisham does a reasonably good job in setting the historical scene in bigot-ridden Mississippi, the long passages detailing mundane characters and trivial parathemes are mostly superfluous. When the story finally enters second gear around page 420 (of approx. 480) it is too late, and the reader is longing for an ending, no matter how it arrives. Even then, the build up to the finale is jerky and completely lacks suspense. Grisham must be one of the most over-rated writers of fiction today."
1,"Can you say, ""BOOOOOORING?!!!""","I used to LOVE John Grisham, but I found this book extremely boring and yet the perfect book to bore me right to sleep every night. I only needed to read one page each night before I was out. I can understand his other books centered around Christmas and family life being more sensitive and about feelings and stuff, but when the title comes right out and says, "" The Last Juror"" and there's a picture of a Jury table on the front cover I expect it to be as fast-paced and exciting as all of his other law books. I was very dissapointed. The summary on the inside flaps actually built it up that way, which is why I forked over the money to buy it. But, like many movie trailers, most all of the exciting parts were in the summary and the book, for the most part dragged and dragged. If you are looking for a typical fast-paced John Grisham book do not get The Last Juror. You will be highly dissapointed!"
2,He just doesn't have the touch anymore...,"Really frustrating to spend all this time reading a book that juts goes nowhere. I just can't believe this was the same author who wrote the runaway jury, a time to kill and the firm. This book was basically like a ""painted house"" with a sprinkle of suspense. Disappointing!"
1,Can I have my money back please??????,"This is by far one of the worst books I have ever read! I typically find Grisham books to be entertaining. However, this book was a total bore. In a perfect world, this would have been a great 20 page short story. Hopefully they will not attempt to make this into a movie!"
3,The ending left me wanting more.,I'm ready for Grisham to return to writing books like The Runaway Jury. The ending in this book as well as the King of Torts left a lot to be desired.
2,Wake up the editor,"This is the type of story you'd see on a TV news magazine show. Instead of taking a break during the story and going to a commercial in between, Grisham has to fill up space. I don't know if it was because he had to fill up pages, or because it allows him to express his own politcial views (D), but Grisham goes all out. Readers can tell that he is trying to talk about Wal-Mart and what it does coming to town (as he sees it), and he uses Vietnam to point out his feelings on Iraq. It's not enough just to point these out, he has to include the editorials and speeches in the text.Why do we have to read through this? This was an interesting story, but it stretched far too long. Where was the editor when this manuscript came in? Did they just let him ramble because they know it will be a bestseller? Just stick with the story. I don't care how short it is. Maybe put two together if you have to. I enjoyed the personal impact ending, as opposed to the plot ending, which was a bit lame."
2,Yawn,"I am so glad I am done with this book. I have never not finished something I've started, but was darn close with this. Boring. If I wanted to read about segregation in the south I would have chosen a non-fiction book.I was excpecting an exciting, fast paced, ""whodunnit"" thriller. Boring. The charachters are absolutely forgetfull. I really enjoy reading and developing a ""relationship"" with well drawn charachters. None hear. So much more could have been done with the offing of the jurors. Just bang,bang their dead? How bout some detail!? Boring. This was the first Grisham novel I have read, and frankly, I was extremely dissapointed."
2,Mailed It In,"While Grisham's description of small town Southern America might make for an interesting read as a New Yorker piece, in this alleged 'mystery' novel, it becomes tedious and a bore. Has anyone born since 1960 not read or heard all of this before ?If the background patronizes us, then the plot insults. Anyone moderately well read mystery reader will call this one about 100 pages before the finish line. Mr. Grisham, take a year off."
1,The Last Juror,"I was disappointed in this book. I always look forward to Grisham's books, and have read all of them. This one was too slow, and I almost stopped reading. Instead, I skimmed. He seemed wander a lot, and I never was sure where he was headed. I hope he does better with his next one."
1,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ (What a snoozer),"I read this book a while ago, but recently thought about it again when someone brought up bad books.I had never read a Grisham novel before this one, and I really expected so much more with all the hype his novels get. As it stands, I have not picked up a Grisham novel since reading this one. What a terrible book. Maybe I missed something, but there didn't seem to be any noteworthy plotlines to warrant writing a book about. I kept thinking, ""When is all the action gonna happen? When is all the intrigue and suspense going to take place?"" Well, here's the answer: NEVER.I made it all the way to the end of the book, only because I didn't want to think I'd wasted my time reading the earlier chapters. I was going to make it through the book even if it killed me -- but at least that would have been more action than was in the book!"
2,"Read ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" Instead","I thought this book was, at best, lame. I have not before read Grisham's work, and expected a thriller, a page-turner, perhaps something similar to ""The Da Vinci Code."" What I got was a long, slow, tedious retelling of the trial portion of ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" complete with the southern charm, token black woman, trashy white criminal, rape and murder. I had much higher expectations, and was keenly disappointed."
1,"The Last Juror is Low-fat, Salt-free Grisham","""The Last Juror"" - what a disappointment. It started out as such a promising grabber - only to fizzle into a frustrating bore. The character development was lame and where the heck was the plot? When reading Grisham's earlier books, I loved being ""taken away""; after reading this book, I just feel ""taken"".As a Legal Aid lawyer, and having lived in a small southern city, I applaud Mr. Grisham's adroit handling of complex racial and social issues in previous books. In ""The Last Juror"", the character development and plot did not go far enough to either deal effectively with issues or entertain. I'd like to see Grisham take the same characters and write a sequel that has some bite.Please, Mr. Grisham, give us something rich and complex that we can sink our teeth into and then savor long after reading that last page."
2,I 'm a Grisham fan. This is not his best work.,"I didn't connect with any of the characters. He didn't give me a reason to. There was one point where I thought I might connect with Callie, but it never happened. Grisham wasn't sure where he wanted this story to go, so he rambled on for 355 pages with laws from the 70's that were or were not true; elections that I could care less about because there wasn't a reason to care; he threw in a ""walmart"" taking over the town; a nude sniper. Although I finished the book, on several occasions, I found myslef asking ""why am I wasting my time reading this book?"" A waste it is."
1,Grisham fails again!,"With all the hype,I really thought Grisham was back. I was wrong. This book drags on with very little excitement and no great charactars. What a waste of money."
3,Over-rated.,"I'm curious as to whether or not people get paid by the weight of there book. The Last Juror by John Grishham is an over-rated book, full of long dribbley paragraphs.Some of the character development was sub-par, and the plot is repetitive and somewhat predictable. Another problem I have with the book is that it just *ends* in basically one chapter. It seemed like he was like ""Alright, I'm done. Time to end this train wreck"".Even though I feel this book isn't John Grishams best, I've still read a lot worse, which is why I gave it 3 stars."
4,Good book for lazy days,"Welcome to Mayberry... err, Clanton, Mississippi, an old southern town full of charm and interesting characters. The central character is a young man who takes over the town newspaper, and tells a story of how his life in the town evolves over a period of 9 years, centered about the brutal murder of a young woman and the ensuing trial, etc. The story rambles, and never really becomes a gripping suspense. But it is a pleasant read - the sort of book that is good for your blood pressure. The ending is somewhat predictable. Grisham writes with class, as usual."
2,Murder? Where?,"When I purchased the book, I expected a typical mystery (something I was in the mood for). That is not what I got. Instead, I got more of a Saturday afternoon movie. The actual ""murder"" takes up only a 1/5th of the book. The rest is a sociological study of Mississippi. If I was in the mood for that, I would have gotten a sociology book. Why label it a mystery when that is not what this is about?"
3,Good but misleading,"Read the book and you'll understand, the book doesn't stick to the title, and actually, doesn't stick to much of what the backcover says. Borrow the book from a friend, or local library, because this book, is just average. His much better ones are, Pelican Brief, Street Lawyer, and A time to kill. Fantastic books, that if haven't already captured your attention, will."
2,"Grisham's Best? Yes, but.","I'm normally not the type to go for Irving/Grisham/Clancy novels, but stranded in the Raleigh/Durham airport, I decided to venture into new territory. The review blurbs on the book from the NYTimes and others all glowed that this was Grisham's best work ever. It was ""atmospheric"", ""tonal"", approaching true ""literature"". I was sold.I quickly finished the novel and set it down with a sigh of relief--relief that I'd finished the damn thing and relief that I had never subjected myself to other Grisham works. This novel was light on anything of legal interest, lacking in interesting suspense, and of dubious effect when it came to the verisimilutude of the two main protagonists.There was nothing wrong, per se, with the novel; but by the end I was completely unmoved. For those who say that this novel is great despite lacking in legal suspense, fine; but if you want a good literary narrative than go read a real novel."
4,"Not quite a suspense novel, but an interesting small town","The Last Juror started off excelent, it had a great plot and Grisham built on it well. It may have started to stray somewhat in the middle of the novel, though I still enjoyed it thoroughly. I have been reading many complaints about how Grisham focus's more on the characters than on the ""Suspense"" of the novel. I agree that the book wasn't really what you might call suspense, but it was just as good if not better. I became attached to the characters and I actually cared about what would happen to them on an almost personal level. Not many books I have read have made me feel the same way as The Last Juror. I commend Grisham for this and I recommend the book for anyone who likes reading books for more than just a heartpounding, suspense, thriller."
3,Not even closer to A Time to Kill,"Although the first part of the book as the third part are really thrilling, you can skip almost all the second part, what happened when Danny was in jail is a waste of time except two or three things that could be written in two pages, the only message of this book is that in Mississippi there were no laws, and the few that existed you could break them if you had enough money to bribe the correct person."
3,my book review,"Before I started reading, The Last Juror sounded exciting. However, once I picked it up it was disappointing. The beginning of the book was good, but after the first 50 pages it was just frustrating. Grisham spends 60 pages telling us how Willie visits every church in his county, and how everyone is mad that Bargain City is coming to town. Almost half of the book was wasted on useless information, so I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a slow, uneventful read."
2,"John , We Hardly Knew Ye","What has happenned to the author of such thrillers as The Firm, and Runaway Jury ? With The Last Juror Grisham seems to be continuing his journey to who knows where ( but obviously the trip includes the bank ).I really wanted to like this book, but didn't. Whoever wrote the NY Times reivew on the cover, "" One of his best: a thouughtful and atmospheric thirller"" clearly did not read the book. It might be atmospheric, but a thriller it isn't. Also, it seems real preachy, ie hard working loveable black mother raises a bunch of PhD's and charms the young newspaper editor with food and stories about how hard it was back in the dark old days in Mississippi. Been there and got the t-shirt many times.This book is in the category of Grisham's The Testament for which he should have been prosecuted for writing.Save your money."
3,Small Town Life Circa 1970,"A solid story from John Grisham with an easy, enjoyable pace. Although its billed as an action adventure--who's killing the jury?--this is more of a character study set in a small, southern town circa 1970.Young Willy Trainer becomes the owner of a newspaper that coverages everything from the obits to the garden club meetings to an infamous murder trial. Along the way, we meet the local eccentrics, all whom Grisham creates to perfection. The main event is the murder trial of a young widow killed by a member of the local drug-dealing, bad-guy family. After conviction, there is a threat against the jurors who participated in the trial. Ten years later, some of those jurors start dying.I am a Grisham fan. I like his gentle, predictable characters. The good guy always win, most often walking away into a tropical paradise with a boatload of money. In my mind, that is always a suitable ending."
3,the last jury,I liked the changes that took place in the south in ten years. I liked learning about the day to day goings on at a newspaper. I listened to it in one day. But the black characters felt cliched and one dimensional.
4,Small town Mississippi.,"I find what distinguishes the best authors from the ordinary is character development. Along with interpersonal dynamics, this book demonstrates it well. The characterization of the Mississippi town and its denizens is very well-wrought.On the down side, the plot is nothing special. And I am tired of women throwing themselves at the hero. Does he always have to be a Sam Spade playboy? Is it too cynical to think that with the narrator screwing the murdered woman's sister a couple of times the author is just covering all his bases?"
3,Not Grisham's Best,"I usually adore Grisham. To me, he's the king of plot. But this one is a bit disappointing. The rhythm is sometimes painfully slow --even if we are in a small town here-- and the writing almost static. The fact that the book is presented as a thriller is not helping. Whoever handles the promotion of this novel, please don't try to full the reader! Grisham readers are not stupid, and this is a far cry from a thriller. The chronicles of a small town would be a better definition. Any small town. I live in a Northern small town, Clarion, which in many ways resembles Grisham's Southern Clanton --and not just for all the letters the two towns have in common. There is no better background to describe the human condition, which Grisham attempts to do. I do appreciate the Balzacian efforts, but all along the reading, I felt that Grisham was not totally comfortable in this territory. Still, he's the author of A PAINTED HOUSE, a brilliant novel in my view. So what went wrong here?"
5,One of Grisham's best!,"If you crossed ""The Painted House"" with ""The Firm"", you'd get a book like this one. I thought it was one of Grisham's best ever. I haven't cared for Grisham's latest mysteries - they've merely been vehicles for his heavy-handed and probably recently-discovered social conscience. Only the newly-saved get that preachy. I surprised myself by enjoying 'Painted House', though it's not the kind of book I read for pleasure very often.I'm fully aware of how grim reality is and tend to look for entertainment that let's me escape from the brutality & tragedy of real life. In movies, if it has explosions, I'll probably like it. Now you know where I'm coming from.""Last Juror"" had just enough literary ""merit"" to make the characters come alive. But, it still had good guys and bad guys and action and all the other stuff that make it a fun read. And, it kept me up late, on the edge of my seat."
4,Back To Classic Grisham,"Finally!! After reading The Pelican Brief years ago, I dove into the world of Grisham. I read The Street Lawyer, The Partner, The Chamber, The Testament, The Rainmaker, The Runaway Jury, The Firm, and then I started in on the newer ones. Was I ever disappointed! I wanted the Grisham I enjoyed so much from before. Where was he? What is this stuff he was putting out? It was not the Grisham I enjoyed. So, I gave up on him.My wife picked this up at a garage sale for 50 cents, so I gave it a whirl. Finally, back to the classic Grisham. Not his best work, but it is a start back in the right direction. I enjoyed the book, the characters, the story, the familiar town. A good story of people and life in the ever changing south in the 70's.If you want a dose of classic Grisham, give this a try and we'll all hope he continues back to what we all loved him for in the beginning."
2,If this is his best in years...,"I am glad I have not read him in years. Very exciting beginning, but quickly fades to dull and uninteresting. By the middle of the book, I could not wait for the end, not because I was interested in how it turned out, but instead I was no longer enjoying it.Lovely Bones is considerably better."
1,Another Disappointment,"Grisham is off on another political tirade. He starts off developing a decent plot and then abandons it. He gets off on an anti-Vietnam crusade extolling the virtues of running off to Canada. He focuses on his relationship with a matriarch which, again, diverts from the story line. He treats the solving of final crimes as an afterthought. Grisham has clearly lost it. Where he once wove a tale that meshed from beginning to end, he now appears on an ego trip to stuff his political predjuces down the readers throat at the expense of whatever plot he initiated. I was also disappointed with The King Of Torts for many of the same reasons. This was the last book by him that I shall read."
2,Definitely not his best work,"I found the storyline of this book to be very interesting, but it kept deviating away from the story and introduced way too many characters, that in my opinion, had little or nothing to do with the story. It's almost as if this was a short story stretched into novel length. Either that or the author was under a deadline to crank the next book out and this is the result. Still overall it wasn't terrible, but still not one of his best works, that's for certain."
1,Terrible deceit,"The jacket cover write-up of this book leads one to believe it is a courtroom thriller, like other Grisham novels. In fact it is not. It is a very slow-paced story of a newspaper in a sleepy little town. If Grisham really had faith in this story he should have hyped it for what it is and drawn an audience with its eyes open, rather than using deceit to lure unsuspecting readers to their 400 page, excruciatingly tiny-printed doom."
2,LAST IN PREFERENCE,"Grisham is one of best the authors i've ever read, but the Last Juror is a great deception. It's a very well written book, but it don't have that ""impossible to put down"" thing the others do.When you are not impacient to know the closing of a case slow carried by the pages of the book, it indicates that something is very wrong with the plot. It's realy diferent from the other 11 books i've read from the author."
1,"Boring, boring, boring","Grisham has definitely lost his edge! Where is the suspense? Where are the page turners we so eagerly awaited since ""The King of Torts""? We're sick of reading about racism in the South in the 1970's, we want a book that's a gripping read like his earlier books. Quite a disappointment."
2,Very Disappointing,"I have read most of Grisham's books and was quite excited when this one came out. However, after reading it, I was disappointed. Sure, the books starts off with a very interesting plot, but 1/3rd of the way through the book, the trial has ended and the rest of the time is spent following Willie around town. I wish Grisham would go back to the writing style that got him here in the first place."
1,This is the worst book he has ever written,"This is the by far the worst book I have ever purchased. I would love to have my money back. What was John Grisham thinking about, when he wrote this? Obviously, he wasn't thinking. I have read everyone of his books, and if the rest of them are going to be like this, I will have to pass. I am an avid reader of John's; I am the one that can't wait until his next book comes out. I will have to wait next time, because I won't ever read another one like this!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,"Don't buy if you're a Grisham fan; if you're not a Grisham fan, DEFINITELY don't buy","I bought this book before a transatlantic flight and hoped to spend a few enjoyable, thrilling hours as I usually do with Grisham books. No such luck.The Last Juror is tedious, slow-paced, and - not like Grisham - predictable. The reason I am giving it 3 stars and not a lower rating is that, despite all, Grisham is a gifted writer and creates lively characters who are easy to sympathise with, and there is the occasional spark of humor. The end of the story somewhat lifts the overall impression (sorry, no spoiler here...) but I got to it already tired and frustrated, so the overall aftertaste is not what I am used to feel after good old Grisham books."
2,Is this Grisham?,"I've read most of John Grisham's books and have always enjoyed his storyteller voice and style. This book carries a very different tone and style -- it's much more cliched and predictable, and much less of a page-turner (in fact, many times it borders on boring). My biggest complaint is that he is sloppy in his storytelling, and inconsistencies, contradictions, and loose ends abound. It's nothing like his early legal thrillers, and is not even as good as his recent books like Bleachers and The Broker. If you plan to skip a Grisham book, this should be the one."
2,poor effort,"This was a simplistic novel. The characters lacked credibility and their personalities were stereotypical. The plot was unwielding and unsatisfying. It was difficult to figure out who the ultimate killer was because it was totally unrealistic. Grisham's novels always have a feel good aspect to them (i.e. lawyer finds his way; justice prevails) and I think that is what hooks the reader. The quality of the book is secondary. There are so many better writers out there ( Elizabeth George, Laura Lippman, Peter Robinson). I suggest readers give these authors a chance. You won't be sorry."
2,The Last John Grisham book I'll ever read.,"The Last Juror was a sad disappointment. I had heard great things about John Grisham but had never read any of his books. I chose to read this for a book club, and had it not been my responsibility to finish it, I probably would have never finished it. It was moderately suspenseful in the beginning, and then it just died off. Danny went to jail, and that was it. All of a sudden I was smothered with meaningless details about Willie's life and acceptance in Mississippi. At that point, I didn't care if Danny was guilty or not. I didn't care how the story ended. But as I said, I had to read it, so I skipped through a few pages of blabber, and made my way through the painfully boring ending. It was a sad excuse for a suspense novel."
2,Grisham has lost his touch....,"Drivel and more Drivel....Grisham has lost his touch. You can't write good suspense novels using Harlequin Romance Techniques, filling the pages with unsubstantial filler. If you liked ""The Pelican Brief"", and was unsatisfied with ""The Bleachers"", then you and I will agree on this one."
2,Last Juror,"Nice book but not up to his previous work. Didn't bother to finish his work. Must have been in a hurry, under pressure from publisher. Would not recommend."
3,"Eh, it's just ok, not what I expected from John Grisham","I absolutely loved The Summons, The King of Torts and The Partner, but this book was not like the others. It's not a legal thriller but a history lesson about the South. If you are interested in foods of the South and the Civil Rights movement, then this book is for you. If you are expecting a legal thriller like previous John Grisham novels, look elsewhere-- you will be disappointed like I was!"
3,"A story, with a thriller trying to get out","Grisham tries to mix his two styles here. He made his start with the fast-paced thrillers and has spent his last few novels telling stories (A Painted House, Bleachers).In ""The Last Juror"", Grisham tells the story of Willie Traynor and his exploits as the young owner of a newspaper in Clanton in the 1970's. He mixes in a little thriller spice when a murderer gets paroled and the members of the jury that convicted him start getting murdered as well.It was a decent read, but not what I was expecting. If you want a fast-paced thriller, pick another book. If you liked ""A Painted House"" or ""Bleachers"" this is a worthwhile book to read."
3,and the verdict is....,"that this book probably deserves closer to 3.5 stars. The story centers around young Willie Traynor who becomes the owner of a small town Southern newspaper. As with all small towns, news travels fast and when a horific murder is committed, the news spreads like wildfire. Justice is demanded and small town grievances and bullies are all the talk of the town. The last juror is really someone who Willie befriends during the course of the novel. Less about law and more about small town life in the deep South. The law that is referenced is obviously well reserached and the author makes note of what he cites as intentional discrepancies. I happen to like the thrill of Grisham's earlier novels better than this one. It reminded me too much of A Time to Kill really. I'd recommend taking this out of the library and would suggest it as a good in flight read in lieu of a movie."
5,Another Grisham 5 star,Just can't beat John Grisham books and The Last Juror was an A+. I had this downloaded to my Kindle so that I could stay up late and read without disturbing my husband. It is hard to put this one down. My husband wonders why I am so sleepy in the morning. He doesn't know I have been enjoying excitement with John instead of sleeping!!
3,Injoyable but slow,I find the story slow moving at times. I guess in Mississippi life was a whole lot slower. But it was fast enough to keep me interested. This was more of a human interest story between Willie Traynor &Callie Ruffin.
3,Clanton is a BUSY town!,"I have ALL of John Grisham's novels and this is the second one written about Clanton Mississippi! Murder(and mayhem) are the topics in two of his novels. I was familiar with one character in this novel, lawyer Harry Rex Vonner, also from ""A Time to Kill"". The other characters in this book were well fleshed-out. This book was written from the point of view of a young newspaper publisher, not a lawyer, so it was ""different"" from the usually brilliant Grisham legal books.If only John's ATTEMPT at writing this book had been as wonderful as his descriptions of ""Miss Callie's cooking"", I'd give him 4 stars!I was really looking forward to another 'legal thriller' (as alluded to on the book jacket) but this book did NOT deliver."
2,It was so-so,"I read this book and found that it is a little bland. I think that Grisham is just throwing books together now and not taking the time to make a great book. Still think his best book to date is a ""A Time TO Kill"""
1,Where's the plot?,"This books takes the reader to the very edge of suspense but never produces the thrill. I kept hoping, until the very last page, to be awarded with the twist or big payoff at the end of the story. I am a huge fan and normally read a Grisham book in 2 days, this one took me 3 weeks. I forced myself to finish it because I had woven a web in my mind and wanted to see if I was right. It turned out my ending was better than the one in the book. The account of life in a small southern town during the 70's was a pleasant read but not enough to make up for the missing plot and average story."
3,Wandering read,"This book is like a donut, it doesn't have a middle. What it does have are the kinds of characters you have come to expect from a Grisham novel set in the south: hard drinking lawyers, corrupt cops and bad guys.The plot is pretty basic. A horrible rape and murder takes place. The bad guy is apprehended and sent away for a couple of years, then he gets out and jury members start dropping over dead. The problem is the ten years in between. Grisham fills this void with his social commentary on the Vietnam War, race relations and the rest.Willie, the main character and accidental newspaper editor comes of age during the time. The story moves along like a rudderless ship on a calm sea.Most of us buy his books hoping to read another Rainmaker or the Firm or the Testament.This book was probably an effort to write. It certainly was an effort to read."
3,"Nothing really wrong, just very blah","This novel is sort of a combination of a two different novels, one about a trial, and nine years later. It is definitely typical of later Grisham. Predictable, short, but readable.Grisham describes the life of a young man who moves to the south and buys a small county newspaper. The first part deals with a trial of a gruesome murder. The second part deals with a mysterious killer (though who the real killer is insultingly obvious). Along with it, Grisham uses this story to weave in other stories about racial integration, southern style, and families.There is nothing wrong with this book except for the fact that it tries to be all in one and doesn't go into any great depth. Is it a thriller, a social commentary piece, or a law book? It tries to be all three and the result is very ho hum.Definitely better than ""The Street Lawyer"" or ""King of Torts"". Doesn't reach the heights of ""The Chamber"" or ""A Painted House.""It's a decent read, but very mundane."
3,Legal thrills with human interest story...,"The 1st part of this book is really good, good characters, murder, mystery, legal courtroom drama and journalism. The 2nd part was not very interesting to me, although the ending was good. Looks like Grisham is giving us a 1/2 legal(Runaway Jury) and 1/2 human interest(Painted House) story. Overall an enjoyable read for me. I prefer the author's legal thrillers."
4,Good,"I thought this was Grisham's best book in years. He captured the spirit of the 70s in the deep south while giving the darker aspects those difficult times a light touch. His quirky characters (one of the things he does best)were well written. And, for those of us who loved ""A Time to Kill,"" it was interesting to compare characters in this loose ""prequel."""
3,awesome kinda but great in a decent way.,this album is pretty sweet - it made me set my neighbors house on fire... so its pretty sweet. It then inspired me to invent Google - the worlds leading search engine.its craziness is cool. you should listen. it talks to you. SHUT UP ALBUM.
1,Cruelty towards animals!,"Elevages Perigord is a company that promotes cruelty towards defenseless animals. They torture and inhumanly treat animals. Please do your research about them if you are thinking of buying any of their products.Amazon, I will not shop your site until products from this company are discontinued."
5,Great Bottles,I used these bottles with my now 2 year old and I plan on using them with my unborn daughter. These bottles are great. They are easy to clean too. I would highly recommend them to my family and friends.
5,Fantastic bottles!,"These bottles are great! We've been using them for 5 months now. Our baby is never gassy and very rarely does he spit up. Don't be intimidated by the ""extra cleaning"" you might read about. I just run a sink of sudsy water and throw everything in. I wash out the bottles and nipples with a brush, but I just rinse off the other parts. I've never used that little brush that came with them, because I haven't needed to. They get plenty clean by sitting in the hot suds. I use them with breast milk and formula and have never had any build-up in the tubing."
2,Disappointing,"We bought this product based on its testimonials and thought it would be the best choice for our new baby. While he had no problems using the Playtex Nursers, he ended up having a problem with Dr. brown's Natural Flow bottles. First off, they are a pain to clean. Each piece needs to be painstakenly washed (boiling the nipple, washing the bottle, and scrubbing each hole of the the insert and the reservoir.) It was certainly laborsome and time consuming. Anyhow, when he uses them, he spits up where he didn't with the competition. I tried to figure out why. If you tip the bottle over it drips constantly without any sucking. So my baby is not sucking or swallowing when he uses this product. He lets it build up in his mouth and then ends up having to push it out when he has gotten too much. Needless to say, we are planning to return these and will stick with Playtex."
1,disappointing,"you might think there would be some legitimate weightlifting advice here. nick evans is in good shape, after all, so his advice should be great, right?the video only deals with the absolute basics of 14 or 15 exercises, and rushes through 3 workouts that use those exercises.the total runtime of this video is about 50 minutes. it's much to short to explain either proper technique or a thorough routine.actually, i would say technique is much more important than putting a routine together. and here, the video not only fails to deliver, but some of the information and the way the exercises are performed is just downright wrong. please please please don't try to do squats and shoulder presses the way shown in the video!get starting strength by mark rippetoe if you're a beginner."
5,One of the best,"This is one of my favourite martial arts movies.In my opinion, Van Damme's first three or four movies are his best.Bloodsport has well choreographed fighting, and is actually based on a true story."
5,Classic,"This is one cheesy movie that anyone can enjoy and wont ever forget.It is so stupid, yet it comes off fun and hilarious to the point where if you even watch 10 mins of this movie you will see it to the end everytime. Even people who take movies seriously will enjoy this."
2,"This movie was very good 17 years ago, but not now","OK, its very obvious that this film wouldn't stand for the quality of plot, acting, etc. The whole thing about this kind of films is the fighting choreographys. The ones in this movie are pretty outdated. I was bored watching them. This film is recommended for die-hard van Dame fans or nostalgics of the 80's martial arts films. By the way, i didn't buy that this story is true. Well, i did when I was a teenager. Just because Hollywood says its true, one shouldn't have blind faith. I guess in the 80s it was easier to say this kind of lies than now that we have the internet. How many times do we have to see martial art ""teachers"" claiming to be involved in the past with secret operations forces? They're not only in the phone book promoting their gyms, they're also in the entertainment world"
3,Ehhh NOt Really Good,"YEa looking at this movie I came up with the conclusion that its not that good, ok at best, The action scenes are so lame and van damme is one bad actor, supported by a whole array of even worst ones than him, not a big deal itll entertain i guess those fond of crappy martial art films, You can skip This one Ppl, A guilty Pleasure I think not."
1,Everyone loved these kind of movies until they saw the U.F.C,"How nave were we back in the day. When this came out every wanna be tough guy was mimicking it. Then the Ultimate fighting Championship came around and showed us all how useless spinning round kicks were. Once you see a real fight, you just watch these fight sequences and just shake your head and wonder how they could destroy such a great true story. The true story of Frank Dux sounds very interesting, but his name will be forever attached to the now has been that is Jeanne-Claude Van Damme. Most of us wish that Jeanne-Claude's only role was the role of Predator in a blue body suite that they would basically blur out and show only the tracers. He only did that role for one day then quit. I imagine he wanted to K.O. his agent after booking him for that role. Ironically, many people including myself believe that this was his best role. Talk about depressing. Peaking your career at arguably the lowest point of cinima."
4,Good but Kickboxer was better and had a better bad guy,I thought this was good but Kickboxer was alot better and Bolo Yeung's Chong Li was a good example of how sore losers can actually be.This is still good to watch though.
4,about the movie bloodsport........,"This story is basically jean trying to avenge the death of someone through fighting in an underground fighting death ring. The undeground death fighting ring is based in hongkong with losts of fighting scenes. This also appears on how Jean is trained to become a fighter. A very good recommendation to those whom are interested in this genre of movie/films. There are some other titles which one could find near your theatre if any and the titles are: gambler's tragedy, terrorist (9/11), Japanese army, mass killers (man and woman), Problematic youngsters, 1046, baby killer, industrial tragedy, workholic and mafias (mobsters - liu mang meaning in chinese)."
5,Bloodsport is super fun,"I had lots of fun watching the fights in this movie, the were wicked, I wish JCVD would make more movies like this and the Quest. If you like fighting or martial arts watch it"
3,"Alright, but...","If all you're looking for is a cool fighting movie, then this is probably it. The scenes of the actual Kumite aren't bad, and a lot of different styles are represented (muay thai, kung fu, western wrestling, sumo, etc...). However, first let me say that this movie isn't accurate of Frank Dux's life, and second, Dux-ryu is a joke. I lowered my review of this movie just because they tried to pull it off as being a biography. Whatever... But it's still worth watching because there are many fighting scenes that are fairly well done. If you enjoyed this movie, I would also recommend Van Damme's ""Kickboxer"" (ONLY the first one, the rest were bad)."
3,Aren't you a little young for Kumite??,"Uhr....ar-ent yew a little olt for de video game? So here he is in all his glory the goofy, feminine, martial artist Van Damme. He plays the story of Frank Dux as he fights in a secret, underground contest that........Oh alright already, you know the story. Riddle me this boys and girls. This was based on a true story and Hollywood needs it's happy ending with the good over evil thing. But in all reality, give me a break. Bolo Yeoung would have torn Van Damme apart in a matter of seconds. Yeah Van Damme has some moves, but you can't kick down a brick house which is exactly what Bolo is.It's a shame Bolo never became a bigger star than he is. Guess the greatest bad guy of martial arts films never got his due. [...] Hollywood, why DOES the good guy need to win? Just once I'd like to see a movie where Bolo kills the heros, keeps the money and jewels and gets the girl.Rock on Bolo. You da man."
5,IT'S ABOUT TIME!,"I had been waiting for this DVD to come out since I first got a DVD player a couple years ago. This is one of the best American Martial Art films ever made. It's also the movie that immortalized Jean-Claud Van Damme, and it's defiantly the best movie he has ever stared in. If you are into martial arts, this is a must own movie. It's great to watch all the various styles of Martial Arts, and the characters are great, including a villain from Bruce Lee's Enter the Dragon. It does very good to stay honest to the various styles of fighting, and the fact it's mostly all filmed in Hong Kong adds a lot. Great fighting, and it has a lot of funny moments. This it's must own, classic action movie."
4,...,"If your a fan of Jean Claude Van Damme or martial arts in general then this is a definate must see.The story about Frank Dux(Van Damme) overcoming the odds to win the ultimate fighting challege, the Kumite. Before the fighting begins Dux meets fellow American Ray Jackson(Donald Gibb) and they form an immediate bond. Dux's biggest challenge comes from reigning Kumite Champion Chong-Li(Bolo Yeung) who holds all the Kumite records. There is not really a rich plot but there is a lot of action. So if you like a movie with little talk and big action this one is for you."
5,Me and my grandfather's favorite movie!,Package arrived on time in all original packing. This was my grandfather's favorite movie and i'm glad to have this dvd in my collection.
4,Classic Van Damme,"Who doesn't occasionally want to travel back in time a decade or two and watch some good old Jean Claude? The ""typical"" for VanDamme, this movie is very Bruce Lee-esque and highly entertaining!"
3,jean-claude at his best,"Van Damme is incredible in this martial arts spectacular about an underground Hong Kong tournament. Movie in the style of Kickboxer and Mortal Kombat but with a much better storyline. Unlike many other martial arts movies, the acting is as good as the fighting. Have seen many times and would have to say it is a must buy for Van Damme and martial arts fans."
5,an important jump for the martial arts world,"I usually think of Van Damme as the prime example of a martial artists who puts minamal effort into his movies. Jean Claude Van Damme has the biggest muscles of any tv martial artist on tv that can still do the splits. no compromising.In this movie he seems to know he can't act, he knows what the audience wants and he delivers in high doses. only in ""The Quest"" does he ever again offer so much quality or quantity. His unlimited potential shines in this old eighties movie.This was a great way to leave back the old days of poorly dubbed people hitting each other with what sounded like whips. I think this is a prime example of a martial arts flick because thats all it tries to be.After this movie Van Damme raised his goals and thus drops his standard. So don't judge this movie off any of his other titles. This movie is one of a kind."
4,Fighting. What else do you need in a martial arts movie?,"I like this movie for 3 reasons.1. They don't waste too much time getting the plot started and once they get to the action its basically one fight after the other.2. Van Damme can't act and he didn't try too. He just beat up a bunch of people and did his neat little jump kick a few times, which is what he does best.3. It has Bolo Yeung in it."
3,"Great moisturizer, bad smell","This product does a great job of moisturizing, but it has a strong odor. The smell disapates over time, but for an hour or so after application it is very noticable. My wife finally asked me to stop using it."
4,Adventure on the High Seas!,"Peter Simple is the tale of a young British midshipman seeking his fame and fortune on the high seas. Set during the Napoleonic wars, it offers comedy and adventure in an old-school style.Originally released in serialized form, Peter Simple is a fun, straight-forward adventure novel. It was a best-seller in it's time (1833) and holds up beautifully. I think this will appeal to anyone who ever thrilled to the works of Rafael Sabatini, Bernard Cornwell, or Orczy's Scarlet Pimpernel. It's an easy read and great fun !"
5,Sailed with the real Master and Commander,"For those who have enjoyed the Patrick O'Brian stories about lucky Jack Aubrey should enjoy this story. Yes, it's fiction but the author sailed with the original source of the O'brian stories, Thomas Cochrane, 10th Lord Duncannon. It's fiction but based on real life in the Royal Navy."
4,"Serviceable, Portable","Met most of our expectations, Height adjustment is not easy to use, have to partially disassemble to use., Have to be a bit cautious when moving with 60"" flat screen"
4,Almost perfect,"We've been using this product for a few weeks. Heavy metal, sturdy and stable with 60"" flat panel. I would only like one addition - a horizontal bar or tube bolted to the upright across the back with a handle at each end to help guide the TV when moving it. Now you have to ""steer"" around corners using the monitor itself. Otherwise a fine product."
2,Not quite there...,"Plot is good, but it's somewhat lacking in execution. Heavy CGI of characters and backgrounds seems too unreal to work, and the insertion of CGI on the foreground and characters puts the effects way over the top like a 90's movie."
2,It tries and tries...,"Get a big cauldron. Next, drop in Blade Runner, Laura Croft and Krull. Mix haphazardly. Throw in pointless and gratuitous nude scenes, a pair of boots with six-inch heels and a weak plot. Simmer in a dank, dark place for two hours and you have the equivalent of 'Gene Generation'.While the idea behind the movie shows some minor promise, the constant sub-plots and generic fight scenes throw the whole film off center. Even the obvious physical talents of Bai Ling don't save this film, despite her best efforts. The special effects supporting the film's pseudo-science are ghastly (not in a good way); It looks like a ball of worms threw up on the actors.This is a B-movie, and a poor example to-boot. If not for the driving music score and the sheer beauty of Bai Ling, it wouldn't even rate that high. While not worth the $4 it cost on Amazon, it might be worth $1 on 'RedBox'; but they were too smart to include it in their lineup."
4,Chase This Paper Down,"AS I said Chase this Paper down, it is worth it if you love great films!This small film won actor/producer John Houseman his best supporting Oscar for his playing the character of Professor Kingsfield. I start off with that fact because you can see this fact while the film unfolds before you. This movie is John Houseman tout de force all the way. Kingsfield plays a teacher's teacher..he runs the students thru their paces.Timothy Bottoms plays Hart, a young law student who is dazed by all the excitement of his first year. He meets Susan ( who isa played by a very young, prew-Bionic Woman Lindsay Wagner) who Hart finds out is Kingsfield's daughter.It is an amazing character study of the first year of law school and those who teach them. Note this film also has the talents of James Naughton and Edward Herrmann in their early tv/film careers.Worth every second of film. It barely date himself, and it was released in 1973Bennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD"
2,Not impressed.,"Having lived through this time period and having heard many good things about this movie, I was deeply disappointed. It was unrealistic in how it basically only showed him having to deal with one class and it was un-entertaining, which surprised me, as I am a fan of Lindsay Wagner.They were so busy trying to be artsy that they forgot to do justice to the story. The end was supposed to be profound, but really left me cold. I was as disillusioned with the movie as Timothy Bottoms was when he discovered the professor still didn't even know his name. I would not recommend this DVD."
4,"Still great, but dated.",Always a great movie for incoming law students. Emphasizes the henious Socratic method. A bit dated.
4,Excellent Purchase,"A ""pimp"" of a purchase for those who have ever heard of the movie & those who love great movies should take advantage of the lowest price out here."
4,The Paper Chase,"The professor is outstanding in this film. The story moves slowly and gets slower, which is too bad. The series which was produced based on the movie was much better."
2,Ok,"Belive it or not, my Contracts professor loves this movie. I on the other hand, do not. The movie was pretty slow and I don't really believe it accurately portrays the current law school experience. I could make for a good movie to scare potential law students and it may make for a good movie for someone who doesn't believe law school acutally was, and sometimes still it, like this. I felt the movie was really slugish, it just wasn't entertaining."
4,The Paper Chase,This is an excellent movie for anyone that is interested in law. It is very realistic as to what goes on at law school.
4,Realistic and interesting,"The Bottom Line:A film about post-grad life that hasn't dated much at all in the last 30 years and provides an interestingly mature look at the life of Law School students with few scenes that ring false (though the lead's romance with his professor's daughter isn't as good as the classroom sequences), The Paper Chase is a good little film which affirms my belief that films set in school are almost neverboring.3/4"
3,All ye law students,"if you plan on attending college and your teen to senior age group,you need to watch this film and discover what its going to feel liketo show up unprepared LOL LOL it made me decide to not do college.too authoritarian, most the students are wetting their pants praying they donot get called upon. nothing like harvard law and the absolutely mostsadistic professor one can imagine to turn one off to its rigourous demands."
3,Paper Chase review,"Enjoyed the film immensely, can understand the aspect of a law student, been there myself. Well structured film and brings out the aspects that you are only a number in the big system. Good for a laugh and memories."
3,Great price for a classic film.,"I very much enjoyed reliving my first experience watching this classic movie from years ago. The commentary was a welcome added addition. For those who don't know, this film led to a TV series also starring John Houseman. I wish it was available on DVD as well."
3,Paper Chase - movie,"The movie was good, but not as good as the series. I can't wait until the show comes out on DVD"
2,Doesn't live up to expectations.,"I bought The Paper Chase on DVD because I like courtroom dramas (Perry Mason, The Verdict, 12 Angry Men, etc.) and I also like school dramas (The Emperor's Club). This film had no courtroom drama and very little in the classroom. John Houseman's scenes are the best, but he's only in a dozen very brief scenes, with perhaps a couple dozen lines in the whole film. The rest is like a soap opera set at Harvard, and very disappointing compared to the expectations set from reading other reviews here."
2,OMG WHY DID WE EVER THINK THIS RAP WAS COOL?!,"TIMOTHY BOTTOMS WAS SO CUTE IN 1973 AND ALL THOSE SHOWER SCENES AND THE 2-3 SWIMMING POOL SCENES. AS OF AUG 2010 THIS MOVIE IS JUST A BIT OF NOSTALGIA, NOT WORTH THE 1:51 LENGTH. SURE GLAD I RENTED VS PURCHASED. RECENTLY I TRIED TO WATCH THE :STRAWBERRY STATEMENT: AND IT WAS SO DATED AND LONG I HAD TO BAIL ON IT. WE WERE INNOCENT AND NAIVE TO BUY INTO THESE FILMS WHEN THEY WERE RELEASED. VERY PREDICTABLE AND FORMULAIC. IMAGINE US COOL KIDS BUYING INTO THE FLIMSY FILMS LIKE THE PAPER CHASE, LOVE STORY, ROMEO AND JULIET, AD NAUSEUM."
2,the facts in the case: a dissenting view,"This film recounts the experiences of a first-year law student in chronological order. There is nothing particularly interesting in these experiences, nor any insights into education, law school, relationships or any of the other things that movies try to enlighten us about.This film will appeal to lawyers who like to reminisce about their good ole days, and maybe law students, but only to them.Everyone else will be sitting, waiting for something to happen. But nothing ever does happen. Nor do we care about the people it doesn't happen to.You have been warned."
5,The Paper Chase,A classic film that was good to share with my 14 year-old son. Fast delviery - good price.
4,We have the same name.,I got this movie to impress a professor in college. Well it worked. That's not why I like the movie though. I thought the story line was impressive enough and there was plenty to think about and keep you wanting more. Overall good movie.
2,13 year old toy enthusiast,"I thought this kitchen would be like the one I used to have. The one that I had had a stocked full fridge, a dishwasher, a big oven and real food. I had real eggs that cracked open and there was an egg inside. But I was wrong and I do not reccomend this kitchen because the fridge has no food in it and the one skillet that comes with it covers almost three burners and you have nothing to cook in the skillet and there is hardly any room to move around and the whole kitchen falls over if you put the toaster where it is supposed to be."
2,what happened to the old dream house and accessories?,"(...) the set that i had when i was a child had a FULLY stocked fridge..unbelievably stocked with things you wouldn't imagine! the stove had bisuits and pies in it. the entire barbie dream house and accessories is totally disapointing. it has absolutly nothing on the dream house and accessories that my mom bought me back in 1981 when I was 6. it looks cheap now and too many things are painted on instead of actually being an object. i know things must change and i'm all for that, but mattel made this change for the worse.it's really not worth buying but of course we moms want our little girls to have the ""barbie dream house"" for the sake of just having it."
4,Cute but no table or chairs,"My daughter saved her allowance for Barbie furniture, and picked this out...like most Barbie items it would help to have an engineering degree to assemble, but it's not as bad as the other reviews would have you believe. It doesn't come with a lot of food items, but I don't mind a Barbie set with fewer small pieces. The only gripe I have about this toy is the lack of a table and chairs."
5,Barbie All Around Home Kitchen,This is better than the kitchen I had. I would agree that the food should be objects rather than cardbord and stickers. Because cardboard and stickers arn't any fun and it is just cheap. I think this is one of the better barbie furniture sets available. Young children are smart these day's and I don't think the small thing's are too much of a danger they are what makes barbie things fun.
2,Not this time Robyn,Tired and lacking.Feels like he had nothing to say but had a record due. A few moments here and there but overall lacks any memorable tunes. Everybody can lay a fat egg and Robyn is human. Thank god for Moss Elixer.Avoid as a starting place but any Hitcher will eventually own it.
3,Uneven,"As much as I like Robyn Hitchcock, this album is one of his weaker efforts overall. ""Mexican God,"" ""Viva Seatac,"" ""Antwoman"" and the title track all range from good to excellent but for the rest of the album I just find myself checking my watch a lot to see how long until the lame filler material plays out and the good songs come on. Robyn's not usually this boring, but much of this album just doesn't go anywhere interesting, lyrically or musically.If you're interested in Robyn Hitchcock there are better places to start. ""Moss Elixir,"" ""Globe of Frogs"" and the Soft Boys' ""Underwater Moonlight"" are all very strong albums that will keep your finger away from the Skip Forward button on your iPod. Keep an eye out for this one in the used bin, but don't pay full price for it."
4,Robyn is back at the top of his form,"Robyn has always walked the hallowed ground tred on by masters like Richard Thompson. He has had his share of missteps, but Jewels isn't one of them. A terrific, melodic, and surprisingly straightforward release that is not without Robyn's trademark lyrical twists. Kind of like the feeling you got when you could finally understand Michael Stipe's lyrics.Sure to place in the top ten of many critic's best of 99 lists."
4,Getting better with age....,"A good bridge between the pop oriented material of A&M and the folkier tunesmithery of later years; while its nice to hear Kimberly Rew playing (and harmonising!) with Robyn, you can't help but wish that the WB auxillary could have been substituted with Metcalfe and Windsor. Yes, six-legged animal and all that, but songs as inspiring as this make you wish it was 1987 all over again. And I'm sorry, you can print ""Peter Buck"" as many times as you want to in the linear notes, Warner Bros, but it won't make a lick of difference. He'd play because he feels like it, okay?Good in parts, brilliant in others, a nice addition to the collection. Curious to find out the connection to all the female references with this one. Really liked ""Viva Sea-Tac"" and ""I Feel Beautiful""""NASA Clapping"" is an electric version of ""Devil's Radio"" though..."
4,'Jewels' Is Another Hitchcock Gem,"Robyn Hitchcock's songwriting alone usually makes any new album by him worth the price of admission. But I have to admit, the songs that really drew me in on ""Jewels For Sophia"" are the ones that feature Peter Buck as guitar co-pilot. It's certainly not that Robyn can't pull off his quirky, eclectic and always melodic songwriting gems by himself (he proved that ably enough during his rollicking and hilarious Seattle Bumbershoot set early in September.) But on the CD, the songs that feature Buck -- Viva! Sea-Tac and Elizabeth Jade most notably -- hit an awsome, rocking groove that suits Robyn just fine. Sally Was A Legend is another standout. Overall, it's a strong album, and worth owning for Viva! Sea-Tac alone!"
4,Understanding the background,"This book is very good to understand the background of Taguchi's approach. He has an interesting view on the different roles of engineers during the design cycle. The concept of Quality Loss is striking.It is not good for learning. The examples shown may be difficult to follow for a beginner. I suggest to read real case studies from the US, from Europe or from Japan in parallel."
1,Lead causes cancer!,"These memorex keyboards are okay. The hot keys won't work unless you install the software on to your computer, but the software is memory resident. So it becomes just another program that eats up your system resources. Also for some reason, memorex decided to put lead as a conductor in the keyboards cord, so you run the risk of getting lead poisoning each and every time you touch the cord. You will see a warning to this effect on the cord itself.That alone is enough of a reason to stay away from Memorex keyboards! Even though Memorex does make cordless keyboards, they lost me as a customer due to their reckless use of lead in their products.Not worth the money, not even if it was free. Buy another brand of keyboard. Lead can cause cancer, so enough said."
1,"This toy is a waste, most especially because of the ridiculous expense.","This toy was a huge waste of my son's Amazon Gift Certificate which he was so excited to use. Given the huge expense of this item, we were stunned and disappointed to find the miniature scale of the toy. A total waste as far as I am concerned, and nearly a complete waste for him as well. Basically the high price for such a small item ruined all the fun as well as having used up the balance of a small boys gift certificate. The toy, although cute for a moment, did not bring any lasting fun. As for durability we wouldn't know because it has not been heavily played with. There is no educational value inherent in the toy or its use, although we knew that when placing the order. We have, however, I think, learned something about ordering items over the internet as opposed to seeing them in a store. I rate this toy, or figure, less than one star."
4,Cute but little washclothes,My friends likes these wash cloths for their twins but they are tiny and I imagine will need frequent washing.
5,Will's Scrapbook,Exactly what I needed to begin our grandsons scrapbook. The graphic print on the scrapbook cover work well with baby's room decor. Very nice !
2,Beautiful to look through but rather Standard,"This little book is beauty for the coffee table, but unfortunatly it offers no real inovative or new ideas. I bought it a while ago but just got round to using it in my projects. It offers the traditional mix and match of fabrics with wall coverings. It actually is more interesting as a general interior design book than one exclusively for wallpaper as the title would suggest. The pictures show the wallpaper used to only decorate a room, rather than to create you know that something that you want by changing from paint to wallpaper or just changing the wallpaper to achieve a new look."
2,A letdown,"Somehow I missed the fact that all the designs were illustrations (watercolor paintings?), not photographs. I get inspired by looking at photos of existing gardens that someone actually created. Looking at paintings just doesn't do it for me. Besides, as the other reviewer said, these gardens are for zones all over the US, not necessarily for my zone, so not all the ideas work for me.The other thing that is missing in this book is at least a small photo of each of the plants/flowers on a page. Sure, I can look them up in another book. I'm familiar with quite a few of the flowers and their Latin/common names, but a beginning gardener wouldn't be. This is definitely not a book for beginners, and even as a more advanced gardener, it was disappointing."
2,Okish film,"This movie of a bumbling policemean (Jimmy Fallon) and a go-getter taxi driver (Queen Latifah) sounds good when you read the blurb.The movies has its moments, especially when Queen Latifah appears on the screen. But, on the whole the movie does not deliver what it promises in the blurb. I would not recommend this movie. See the movie if you have no other options when you go to rent it at your local video store."
4,I thought it was great!,"But then, I've got a bit of a ""thing"" for Jimmy Fallon, so perhaps my opinion is colored by my affinity for him..!I did think this movie was very, very funny. There were some very surprising twists, and some scenes that were so ridiculously funny, they carried the movie.The EXTENDED play version was a little boring, however... I normally love the ""director's cut"" versions of movies, as I'd rather see more - but in this case it created too much time between the really funny parts.I really thought Queen Latifah and Jimmy Fallon were hysterically funny. My kids saw this 4 times in the theatre. I saw it once, then got the DVD as soon as it was available. I do recommend the shorter version if you have the option."
3,Great Ride But UnEven Finish,I like the movie despite the fact that the plot is unrealistic. The movie is about a really good guy but a bad cop played by Jimmy Fallon who's after a bunch of super-model type crooks but is way out his league. That is until Belle who is played by Queen Latifah enters the picture. The ending was bad but wasn't good either. I don't know why Henry Simmons or Ann-Margaret was in the movie it didn't add or subtract in the movie.
4,Very funny,"Taxi looks as though it would be a rediculous movie, and guess what, it is. It's just so rediculous that it's funny! The premise is completely absurd and that's what makes Taxi successful in being a validly funny comedy. This movie doesn't try to be anything it's not. The premise of the movie is about an underdog cop who has issues with driving teaming up with a newly appointed taxi driver who isn't your run of the mill taxi driver. Together they have to solve a big bank robbing case and redeem their reputations. Jimmy Fallon and Queen Latifah are both great in thier roles. There are some pretty sweet car scenes in the movie also, I can't believe how decent they made a Crown Vic look. If you're looking for a fun movie thats sure to provide some laughs than Taxi is for you."
3,Could've been better.,"Queen Latifa was great but Jimmy Fallon is an idot. His character was too hard to watch and was insulting to the audience and to police officers even though it's supposed to be a comedy.See it but don't expect Jimmy Fallon to win any awards, except for maybe the stupid award."
4,Good fun,"We thought this movie was great. Really enjoyed both Fallon and Gueen Lativah. Much better than the reviews. Also, the soundtrack is great."
5,Fun Movie! Highly Recommend!,"If you are in the mood for a fun movie that gives you some laugh out loud moments, this is a great one! Jimmy (playing cop) and Queen Latifah (taxi driver) are great together! (they even sing good together?)If you enjoy Jimmy on SNL, and don't look too closely at the movie's plausibility, but just go to have a good time, like most people in the audience you will be laughing out loud."
3,Funny from start to finish..Stupid but it's supose to be stupid,"Queen Latifah rules like she dose in most of her movies in this stupid but good comadey. The film stars Jimmy Fallon as a bad cop and a terrible driver( as if he would be allowed in the police if your a bad driver as he), Fallon then teams up with Latifah to catch bank Robers. The film is funny from start to finish but is really stupid. You have to turn of your brain to like this movie. It has many stupid moments but it's a movie. Overall the movie is really funny and you wont be disapointed."
4,Good Entertainment,I love Queen Latifah in this movie. I thought the movie was great for entertainment purposes. I would recommend it to those who like action without a whole lot of nudity and cursing.
4,Yellow Cab Fever!,"Jimmy Fallon is a cop who is such a bad driver he loses his license. Queen Latifah is a cab driver with a souped up Taxi who is a great driver. When Fallon comandeers Latifah's cab to stop a bank robbery, vehicular mayhem and fun break out! Add to the mix the fact the bank robbers are Brazillian Super Models and you have a surreal good time for all!Ignore the critics who have cut this movie to shreds. Its pure escapist fun that rates four stars. Enjoy!"
4,The Queen Reigns,"This is one hilarious movie. Queen Latifah steals the show. Fallon holds his own, but Queen nails it. Queen & Fallon's chemistry seems to work pretty good in this comedy. It may not be either of the actors greatest roles, but it is a fairly entertaining comedy. This is definitely a 'feel good' comedy that keeps you laughing from start to finish."
3,"Fast, Funny and enjoyable","I found this movie to be a good laugh even so it wasn't brilliant as some parts where just dam right stupid. But I think that Jimmy Fallon and Queen Latifah kept this film above water as they where a good team against crime. The storyline is pretty straight forward, Fallon is playing the role of a cop who is a terrible driver and ends up losing his licence by driving his car into a store window and killing a partite. City banks are being robbed around the streets of New York by 4 women who are super models. This is where queen Latifah comes into the picture, as she is a cab driver who helps Fallon out as he can't drive any more.This film is not a Oscar winning but it's something easy to watch as there are a few laughs their and than. I found it to be pleasing to the point of saying its just OK. I thought Jimmy Fallon was a pretty funny guy as this was his first real movie. I am looking forward to seeing his new movie with Drew Barrymore in Fever Pitch."
2,Good Grief !,"Story is just ok for a brainless comedy, but by GAWD..that Jimmy Fallon guy is no good comedy actor. He miserably fails to deliver his role to be even remotely funny. I wished they have at least use one of the wayans brothers or any other comedian from SNL. The only person that made me through the entire film was the queen herself (the 2 stars go to her only otherwise this rating of mine should be no stars at all). PRODUCERS...PLS DO NOT GIVE THE ACTOR ANYMORE ROLES...we consumers do not want to waste our money too."
3,funny movie,this movie was great! Queen Latifa and Jimmy fallen should make more movies together. every funny. I gave it 3 stars cause i feel a few parts were slow. but overall a great movie.
2,Boring,"With a few funny scenes, Taxi is mostly boring. Ann-Margaret is great, but Giselle irks me. Has it's good scenes, but it mostly falls flat."
2,ha ha jay!!! This film is crap,I have a friend called Jason o' Byrne and he loves this film... i just wanted to say...Jay this film is REALLY BAD!!!But the models are bleedin animal lookin!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,people sure dont have much use for their brains,"if they have to ''shut it off'' in order to enjoy their choice of entertainment.should we all start wearing bibs and go ''googoo'' as well?!?!this is exactly why hollywood releases such trash as this.they are assured of milions of brain-shutter-off'ers.do these same anti-grey matter force themselves to giggle at the truely corny and cliche?!?!?''i need to validate my buying this ticket....so here goes...ha(1 hour 15 minute gap)ha!''i know damn well hollywood is collectively laughing its a$$ off to the bank!those who gave this a rating above 1 deserving the inevitable sequals.get the wallet out!btw,if the last ditch effort in titling this didnt give the lameness of it away..........so sad!!!!!!!!"
5,pleased,quickly received in condition as described-thank you very much. very pleased with item and transaction.
5,Stupid & Great!,"This is one of my favorite top 10 movies! It's stupid, funny and filled with all the things I love in a comedy. Action, Fast Cars, Jokes and scenes that are so stupid they crack you up. This was definitely one I had to have in my movie collection."
5,love the car,this taxi changes its shape while driving. in this movie a cop uses a taxi driver to escort him around town to fight crime.
2,Generic How to Start a Bussiness Advice,"I was disappointed in this CD compilation because the advice is too generic and not focused on the consulting business. There was advice relevant to restaurants, and choosing a personal computer which I in my opinion is outside the intended scope of this book. I for one certainly didn't purchase this audio book to get pointers on which PC to buy. The data CD is useful if you have nothing else, but there are way better programs out there for making forms, contracts, business plans etc. The last CD, a compilation of short stories of successful entrepreneurs was ok, but nothing to get too exited about. Each story is shorter than two minutes, so there is not enough time for you to identify with any of these stories. In short, I would not recommend this purchase."
4,Comic Book Superheroes Unmasked,"In short, the program is worth watching but might not be worth purchasing. It did provide an insightful overview of the history of comics in America. I was very pleased to see that it contained a varitey of artists and writers who were interviewed for their contributions towards comic art. Will Eisner, Stan Lee, Steranko, and Frank Miller are just a few of the people interviewed. The only disappointing aspect of the program is that it includes little psychological background of superheroes and villans."
1,"mainstream press fails to understand comics,,,,,","This was a cheap and really look down approach to comic books and superheroes in general. The History Channel does not make good production films anymore on any subject, it comes off more as something expensive and cheap you would buy at a mall. I'm hopeful that one day soon, a more in depth film will be made on the history of comic books and superheroes in general, but this trash was not it."
3,router template guide good but threads are different from normal,The router template guide is great except that the threads for the nut are different than the normal set I have. I had to buy a new nut just to use it. Now I have this nut which will only work on this guide.
2,Poor Sound & No Closed Captions or Subtitles,"We gave this a good try. Watched the first episode twice and the second episode once. The sound quality just does not make it. We miss 15 to 20 percent of the dialog. It's a shame because this looks like a really good series. Poor sound quality seems to be a consistent problem with BBC productions. With the poor sound quality we really need the Closed Captioning or Subtitles. I have tried every setting on the Sony DVD player that I can find, but no Closed Captioning or subtitles. The box indicates that it has Closed Captioning, but I can't get it to work. Too bad!"
5,Wow! Puts the American police procedurals to shame!,"I was amazed by the character development, plotting and overall quality of this program. Graphic and gritty, this episode really creates a sense of what working as a detective must be like. I also appreciate the genuine London setting rather than the usual Southern California film set. I'm looking forward to watching the rest of the series soon."
5,Great Writing - Great Performance,"If a tv series is going to be gruesome and be about crime, let it at least be of the quality of Prime Suspect. Helen Mirren is perfection in the role of Jane Tennsion and the writing is superb. The length of the episodes allows for good character and plot development. Someone already said riveting. I totally agree. I've had to dole the episodes out to myself and not gobble them up all on one long, rainy weekend. i'm not much for crime dramas, but this is the best I've seen. Quality much appreciated. And it's so British. It makes our crime dramas look...you know, like totally dumb."
5,Prime Suspect 1,Ordered this for my mom. Shipping was very fast. She loves the series. Have now purchased 1 thru 4-only three more to go!
2,too dated,"was great in it's time I watched them all. Re watching made too dated with police technology,also dialog was dated"
3,Prime Suspect is okay,very good except for how they handled ending because there was no episode after the guy pleaded guilty. Helen Mirren is great
2,Very typical European Show,"I had read/heard a lot about Prime suspect. It's good if you really enjoy european style drama. 4 episodes on 2 cds. Frankly it didn't do it for me. The acting was mediocre, plot was 50/50 prove this guy did it/deal with a woman being in charge. There was not a great deal of suspense. My lack of enjoyment certainly is colored by my bias towards american style cop dramas. I won't be purchasing #2."
5,Police Drama Tour de Force,Prime Suspect 1 is a compelling police drama which also realistically captures the struggle of Detective Chief Inspector Jane Tennison to solve the case whilst dealing with opposition from men who are uncomfortable with a woman DCI. Helen Mirren is intense and Tom Bell is her smirking nemesis in this tour de force drama.
5,A Brilliant Synthesis of Swing Books,"The author, an attorney in Canada, has read and compared all of the great golf instructionals of the past century and has brought them all together, complete with citations, into an easy-to-understand book of only 7 lessons which, taken as a whole, will teach you to swing like the professionals. I highly recommend this book for golfers who are becoming serious about what turns out to be a remarkably complicated process -- striking a golf ball"
4,Flowers of a Deep Sleep.,"Flowers of a deep sleep is sort-a hard to talk about without really giving to much of it away. It is a 2 book series. You don't really get a chance to really get into the characters, and everything is face pasted. It was not something i sat down and enjoyed reading, but i do enjoy looking back on it and thinking about it. It is inspiring. I would recommend it to people who like fantasy/mystery animes."
4,Oldie but a Goodie,"A good Suspense movie, that has a pretty Carol Lynley in it. She did several Suspense movies in the 60's. The IMDB.com movie review for this movie states the storyline as follows: Ann Lake has recently settled in England with her daughter, Bunny. When she goes to retrieve her daughter after the girl's first day at school, no one has any record of Bunny having been registered. When even the police can find no trace that the girl ever existed, they wonder if the child was only a fantasy of Ann's. When Ann's brother backs up the police's suspicions, she appears to be a mentally-disturbed individual. Are they right? Pretty good movie. I recommend it for any Suspense Movie Collectors collection. Also, try to get The Shuttered Room, with Gig Young and Carol Lynley and A young Oliver Reed. Talk about Suspense so thick, you could cut it with a knife."
3,Wonderfully dreary,"If you're in the mood for such things, this movie might interest you, though it's truly a second or third rate thriller and rather aimless. It's a black and white film, set in London and would be a perfect entertainment on a rainy afternoon or evening. Anyway, that's what I like about it. It also has a great supporting cast of aging and aged British character actors. I'd also like to note the excellent score by Paul Glass. The main theme is so lovely and even haunting that I wish it were available on CD.A very good Panavision print is presented on DVD in anamorphic widescreen, but strangely the main title sequence is in stardard letterboxing and will play as windowboxed on 16X9 TVs. It's about as odd as the film itself."
4,Cult Classic gets better with age,"Bunny lake is Missing seemed lost forever, playing late night and early mornings only on cable. Never on video and seen by few since its release in 1965, this sixties shocker finally comes to dvd in all its kooky glory. And, Bunny doesn't disappoint! Great widescreen photography, a chilling story line about incest, strong performances from Lynley and Oliver plus an over the top ending that's simply out of this world! Yeah, it has dated a bit here and there but it's a cult classic so who cares. This movie will live in your mind long after the final credits roll. Not to be missed by anyone who loves great cinema. Long live Bunny Lake forver, now that she's on DVD!"
3,3 stars ..ONLY because the graphics on the packaging are awful.,"The greatest graphic designer, Saul Bass, did one of his best posters for this movie. Instead of using his amazingly beautiful and simple poster for this DVD cover, there is a late 80's-early 90's-esque slash graphic ala ""Fatal Attraction"" and its hordes of copy cat posters that followed."
1,the worst,"This is undoubtedly the worst film Oliver ever starred in and Preminger ever made. The story is ridiculous, Lynley and her ""brother"" in the movie strove mightily and almost successfully to be real actors, and the final result, which is supposed to be creepy, is simply laughable. Bad film fans will not want to miss this turkey. It could indeed become a cult film--you know, show it at midnight, get stoned, and promenade around the theater shouting for Bunny Lake. For people who genuinely liked the movie, well CBS and Fox will provide you with many hours of entertainment, daily."
3,Ok book,"I had to buy this for a class, its much cheaper than at the university book stores and has better availability. Decent book that gets you familiar with the construction process."
5,3 Construction Management books,Books came in good condition and much more convenient and less expensive - by FAR - than buying thru UW.
4,A bit dissappointing,The book was shrink wrapped but it was damaged. Not sure if it was the fault of the publisher or the seller but in either case I expected a better product.
4,John Kay & Steppenwolf - 'Live In London' (Rainman),"Very good live recording of John Kay (with his new band safely renamed Steppenwolf) apparently recorded sometime in 1980. I know I saw the band the following year. Loved the Steppenwolf classics like ""Sookie Sookie"", ""Magic Carpet Ride"", the awesome ""Hey Lawdy Mama"", ""Born To Be Wild"" and the unforgettable ""The Pusher"". But, I seem to remember a couple of the John Kay solo tracks here as well - ""Hot Night In A Cold Town"" along with the happening ""Five Finger Discount"". Personnel: John Kay - guitar & vocals, Michael Palmer - guitar, Chad Perry - bass, Brett Tuggle - keyboards and Steven Palmer - drums. It's nice to know that Steppenwolf still exists to this day while they play at casinos and state fairs. Overall sound quality if very good."
4,Very Romantic!,"A very romantic movie starring one of the biggest idols of the century, Rudolph Valentino. This is a better film then The Sheik both for its plot and its cinematography. Watch both and judge for yourself!"
5,True to life hysterically funny,My partner and I loved this movie. We laughed our butts off. Very British Humor at its very best. This is a movie I cannot wait to purchase on DVD when it becomes available. Do yourselves a favor and see it. If you are depressed you will see for yourself that eccentricities are not just something you have but ALL OF US HAVE! You will love it.
4,Very Funny!,"Skip the 2010 remake. It's amazing how the two movies, with basically the same script, but different actors, are so very different. The British version is very funny, the remake, not so much!"
2,Dissatisfied,This disc was unplayable on my computer. I returned it to the Sender (12th July) & have not received an acknowledgment of its arrival. I have the receipt of sending & await comment with dwindling patience & refund!
3,Meh,"Average big budget ""British"" movie. More Hollywood cliche than anything else. Entertaining but not hysterical. Pretty standard stuff. If you have nothing else to watch then go for it."
5,Hilarious,"This movie is hilarious. It's not dirty either, it has really smart humor, and is really enjoyable. Buy it for sure."
5,Best Comedy of 2007!,"""Death at a Funeral"" was truly the greatest comedy of 2007. A film in which the acting outweighed the billing of the actors. The writing was superb, the delivery was deadpan, the casting was perfect. Every detail was so precise. The pacing was flawless, and the music was great. Rent it, watch it, try not to love it, I dare you!"
4,Death at a Funeral,"I have always enjoyed British humor, but this is one of the funniest movies I have seen. Exceptional cast and great writing and directing have made this one you do not want to miss. I think most families no matter what nationality will ""get"" the jokes and probably be having several laughs. Imagine you are going to your fathers funeral and just about everything that can go wrong does. Sounds horrible doesn't it? Well in this case it is incredibly funny. WARNING! You will see halucinogenic drugs, the backside of naked men, and dead people. However, you will be amazed at how funny that can be. I suggest this for teens and up. Good quality DVD with basic extras and good replayability. If you enjoyed this catch ""Waking Ned Devine"" and ""Hot Fuzz"".CA Luster"
4,Pretty Good,"A lot different than what I expected but still entertaining. I think the fiance on drugs (not of his doing) was a scene/concept that went on for a bit too long and was not entirely believable, but the rest of the movie was just right with its surprising twists and turns. I agree with another reviewer re: the cranky oldster in the wheelchair. Why was this stereotype needed - it didn't add to the movie. It would have been sufficient to have him only in the one scene that truly mattered with that character. That scene was So Funny (as long as it doesn't happen to you it is funny). It was also amusing to see that the British (as portrayed in this film) think a Valium is the answer to every problem. Is that the British health care system in action? One hopes not."
2,Not so funny,"The movie has some pluses. The final eulogy was touching. The fiancee never giving up on her betrothed in spite of what her relatives thinks. However, the bad outweighs the good. The movie relies on drug humor, midget humor, and scatological humor for the gags. They don't even do it well. Cliches abound. The actors seem to be trying hard, but the script never delivers completely. The pacing seems to drag on certain scenes at times. It is definitely frenetic at other times.In summary, perhaps if you were in the right mood, you might enjoy the movie, but there are many better farcical movies out there."
2,Nice House,"Although billed as a ""comedy"" this movie doesn't contain a single laugh. I guess what they meant is a ""comedy of errors"" where unlikely-event-follows-unlikely-event to the point of compounded absurdity. The film doesn't feel like Frank Oz either, but more like a second- (or third-)rate BBC television programme. Characters enter hysterics, stereotypes are overplayed, and everyone talks in a stage whisper. I'm giving it two stars primarily for the gorgeous chateau in which it was filmed -- I want to live there.After I kick everyone out."
1,Utterly Stupid,Do not waste your money on this movie. It is pointless and not remotely funny. I gave it away immediately.
3,Death at a Funeral,An amusing little movie concerning what was supposed to be a quiet family funeral that goes awry with complication after complication.
2,A Movie About LSD,"This movie never failed to disappoint. It held quite a lot of promise, but little (no pun intended) of it came to fruition in this stretched almost comedy that deteriorates into a story of the effects of LSD on people's behavior. The rest of the story was not ""traditional"" British humor, because it would have been funny had it been so. This was predictable, sort of, in most every turn and the ""surprise"" guest and how it was played out was quite disappointing. The film tried and failed miserably to recreate the ambiance of ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"". The single funeral in the latter was better than the entirety of this film. Don't waste your time or money on this."
2,weak and not so good,"I rented this on Unbox as the reviews were good and the trailer looked funny. Well, for me, I couldn't have been more disappointed. I like quirky and sacastic and dark humor. I like british humor. This was a movie I found flat. SPOILER!! The whole gay relationship with a midget and subsequent kidnapping thereof was cheap and crude. And not in a funny way either. Rent/buy at your own risk. I am surprised this movie has as many good reviews as it does. I guess I'm just getting too old?"
3,No better than average,"Typical british humour taking the mickey out of the moment, BUT considering all the hype about how funny this film was supposed to be you will be highly disappointed, watchable alot of the funny scenes are predictable or not even funny - delivery of the wrong body/coffin, the accidently taking the drugs and having the side effects, finding your father was secretly having an affair with another man who happens to be a dwarf. Again watchable but not very funny and certainly not in the class of Four Weddings and a funeral or Bridget Jones Diary."
2,still waiting,I ordered this movie over a month and a half ago and have still yet to receive it. I would not order from this company the_music_shop_au unless you have a lot of patience. I just hope my movie comes in eventually.
5,JUST SEE THE BLOODY THING! :),"I adore this movie,I love the actors,I love it makes me laugh and smile every time I see it,I want to go to this funeral!"
5,British Humor,"Death at a Funeral is quintessential British humor. There are a lot of characters, but each is so different from the others that there is no confusion about identity. The basic premise is a staid, English manor house funeral with the requisite widow, two slightly estranged brothers, and a bevy of friends and family coming to pay their last respects to the recently deceased (and highly respectable)lord of the manor. You begin to see the film's evolution from the moment the funeral home delivers the wrong casket to the manor house! My husband and I both enjoyed this movie very much. There is something here for most ages although it is not suitable for children under 13 and some of the humor might be subtle enough to escape some older teens as well. There is some language and a bit of nudity but nothing highly offensive. Just very funny.Death at a Funeral"
4,"Pretty Slapstick, but Funny","This is a nice innocent sort of movie. Funny bits, wraps up nicely. Made my dad laugh A LOT. Some nudity, but just butts."
4,Death at a Funeral,"This is the original movie! It is great. You really have to enjoy British humor to ""get it."" The cast is great. The scenery is pretty plain but it works well with the movie. Great Funny movie!"
4,Slapstick at a Funeral--I Know it Sounds Weird But it Works!,"""Death at a Funeral"" is set at the home of a wealthy British family that is burying its patriarch. As the family converges for the funeral, several things start to go wrong--the boyfriend of a cousin takes some acid (by accident), the famous brother can't get it together, and oh yeah, the deceased's secret gay lover has shown up (with photos) to blackmail the family. Hilarity ensues despite the sensitive subject matter.This movie's slapstick humor is laugh out funny, and in the end everything turns out okay. This movie is definitely worth a watch for the funny way it confronts family drama and the secrets we all keep at a difficult time."
5,funniest funeral ever!,"This movie has every funny, insane mishap that could possibly happen when families come together. Who would have ever thought a movie about a funeral could be so laugh out loud funny?"
5,Best British comedy!,This movie is so hilarious! Seen it several times and it never gets old. The characters are so well written.
4,Pretty Funny,"I <3 Alan Tudyk. Which was pretty much the only reason I bought the film, but it is genuinely good (for plenty of other reasons). Peter Dinklage is fantastic and I love that the whole film takes place over the course of an afternoon."
1,Caution: F-Word Zone,"We scrapped the movie less than 45 minutes in. It starts slow and is peppered with offensive, unnecessary language. Very disappointing. The DVD is in the trash where it belongs."
1,Gave up at 37 minutes into it,"I borrowed from my library as I do many movies. I tried to watch it but I, too, did not find any amusement and I checked the display and had already watched 37 minutes of it without the hint of a laugh. Does this movie start out REALLY slow because it just wasn't funny to me at all. I consider myself to have a pretty good sense of humor and I laugh easily at funny, witty lines. The bit with the guy who was under the influence of some drug was to me, something only young immature boys would find amusing. I found myself watching this like it was an assignment that I had to complete and I finally just stopped the DVD and gave up.Not my ""cup of tea"", I guess."
1,"Really, really bad","I usually like Brit humor, but this movie just wasn't funny at all. Very bad script. I found it tedious and boring. A lot of scenes went on for too long. (I fast-forwarded through some of them.) The gross-out stuff is better left to Americans. It seemed like the actors were uncomfortable with the material and I felt sorry for them. I lasted maybe an hour and gave up. I'm sorry I wasted a Netflix rental on crap like this. I think I'll skip the USA remake."
1,Not Good,"I did not laugh once during this so-called comedy, and I like a lot of British humor and black comedy. It's not that I didn't get it. I just thought it was tasteless and boring. The production looked cheap."
4,Excellent dark farce,"4.2 starsShort version: The man who directed What About Bob? and did the voices of Miss Piggy, Kermit and Yoda makes a comedy about a funeral featuring accidental psychedelic ingestion and an extortionate gay midget (sorry, dwarf). If that doesn't pique your curiosity, this is not for you.Slightly longer version: Wonderfully off the wall British drawing-room farce writ somewhat large, with perfectly silly script and superlative cast. Director Oz was raised in Britain and it shows; he melds dry Brit wit with some of the better Hollywood tropes and dishes up an oft hilarious film that gets funnier as it goes, and at a pleasantly snappy pace. Tudyk is especially marvellous as the unknowing voyager.A must for any fans of British humor, gleeful weirdness, and intelligent dry wit in general."
4,laughed til I cried and couldn't breath,i love the dry british humour and their sense of formalities...if you are an american watching this you need to appreciate a bit of hte culture. I was smiling all hte way through the movie and nearly died of laughing at one point with the bathroom scene and grandpa...i haven't laughed that hard in a long long time.enjoyable movie
5,Death at a Funeral,"I had viewed this movie previously at the suggestion of a friend and really enjoyed it. I am a fan of darker humor, especially British, so it fit the bill. I purchased this one for a friend."
5,LOL,"Not usually a fan of British humor, but this was one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. My hubby and I were on a plane when we started to watch it and had people in the surrounding 10 rows wonder what the hell we were laughing so hard about. A must see!"
5,Best movie ever seen!! Never laughed so hard,"This is the funniest movie I have ever seen!!! Why isn't it on DVD yet? It would make the perfect Christmas present for those who could use a good laugh. I don't buy movies often, but this one is an exception.There are plenty of reviews that tell what this movie was about, but I don't think the message is clear enough. This movie made my husband and I laugh until our sides hurt and even after the credits rolled most of the people in the theatre just sat there, they didn't want to leave! I am confused by the world today where you enter a movie about fear, brutality and death (there are many examples) and the theatre is packed. But yet a movie like this only had a handful of people and isn't out on DVD yet.Bottom line, see it when you get the chance!"
4,English Screwball Drawing Room Style Comedy,"Daniel (Matthew Macfadyen) presides over a family funeral as the one in charge of the decedent family member's funeral. He is also the straight man for all of these goofy characters who attend it. Those who attend the funeral are a madcap bunch who promise mirth and mayhem at every turn and usually deliver. I did not find this rolling on the floor funny as so many did but I enjoyed it. I thought it was a good night's entertainment on DVD. As you might expect at a family based funeral, all the typical family repressed hostilities come to the fore. Every grievance from the past, concern over property and pecking order within the family eventually works itself to the surface to be dealt with farcically anew. It's taken me a long time to enjoy British comedy. I now do enjoy it quite regularly. However, it may indeed help to be a Brit for this to make it all the way to five stars for a viewer. For me it was four stars."
4,There are scenes where I laughed til I cried!,"I missed this in the theatre and have been anxious for it to go to DVD. There are scenes where I laughed so hard I cried! There are scenes that I find myself remembering through out the day that send me into fits of laughter. Who would ever think a funeral could be so humorous?! The cast was top notch and the actor who plays ""Simon,"" should be given an award. I highly recommend this film. Its only 90 minutes but certainly worth the viewing! ( I'm almost embarrassed to admit it but I've watched twice in two days. It was that entertaining.) I won't bother to go into the story as it is all ready available -- but attest that this comedy is well worth the investment. I'm just sorry that I missed it on the big screne and had to wait so long to see it."
5,Loved this British comedy.,I saw this movie at the show and laughed through the entire movie. I loved it and couldn't wait to own it.
1,Average at best,I found this to be average at best with limited humor and average acting. Most everything that happened was predictable.
1,"Nauseating, disgusting","On the cover by supposed 'reputable' reviewers, it stated such things as 'uproariously funny,' but after 3o minutes and much fast forwarding attempting to get to any funny stuff, I could take no more.If one finds vile, graphic toilet scenes, or someone spitting at others from a rooftop, or predictable, stereotypical character behavior funny, then this may be the movie for you."
1,Pathetic!,"Predictable, cliched, unimaginitive, unoriginal, one gag bollocks! How this script ever made production you couldn't even guess. The set up of the joke is a joke in itself. This is a story written around the one gag the writer must have thought of whilst on the toilet. Spend your money on a blank DVD and get better laughs. Black comedy? Please don't insult the genre...."
1,No-laughs,I cannot recall any other time in my life where I watched a comedy and did not laugh a single time. It was beyond strange - it was freakish. And they had the cast and a pretty good plot (if unoriginal)to pull off a rather good comedy.... The only reason I gave it 1 star is because I had to rank it for the review to be accepted.
3,WHAT A LINE!,According to the description the shade of this liner is not black or brown - it's mahogany. Let's be clear - it's dark brown.Cake liners have always been difficult for me but this one is particularly so. It goes on more easily wet than dry. When a dry application was tried there was either not enough color or so much that it smudged.As for the therapy - where does that come in????
3,Bigger would have been better,"I was thrilled when I found this for my daughter, but was rather disappointed when it arrived. It is very small, about the size of a smaller notecard. The pictures inside are fabulous, just very small. The price printed on the back of the book is cheaper than the price I paid for it. If only they were bigger, even for a couple of dollars more, I think they would have been worth 5 stars."
4,Stained Glass style Coloring Book,This mini coloring book in the style of stained glass (Black boardered with translucent images) is great for children of all ages. The dragon designs are well-rindered and attractive. These are a favorite with the autistic children I work with.
1,Not what I wanted,"The book is very small and the pictures are so tiny with such thick lines,they are not what I thought they would be.NOT a good value for the money.I would not recommend them to anyone."
1,Devil is not in the details,"I was expecting full size coloring books (8.5X11). I am extremely dissatisfied. They are only 4.25"" X 5.5"". Too small to use for stained glass workings. Don't waste your money!"
1,Very Small and only 8 pictures,"This coloring book is a quarter of the size of a regular coloring book. It only measures 4"" by 5"". No where in the description does it say this book is so small!!! I was expecting a normal 12""x8"" They need to put this in the information. Plus there is only 8 pages!"
5,Concise and highly readable.,"A must read for all Jews and those considering becoming Jews.Wouk gives, among other things, an understanding of why it is important to observe the Jewish dietary laws and why improvised prayer has meaning.The result is that I am now incorporating more observances into my daily life. For the first time, I see their importance. This book has changed my life."
5,Clearest and briefest book on the subject I've seen.,"The great advantage of this book has, is the readablity of it. It almost reads like a novel. It covers a huge period, in time and history, in distance and thinking, yet keeps it all within manageable proportion, eminently suitable for a layman."
4,Informative Look for Wide Audience,"Herman Wouk examines Judaism in a modest manner that informs without preaching. Wouk looks at his religion from his Orthodox practice, but with easy-reading prose made for all audiences (Jews, Christians, etc.). Readers learn about the Sabbath, Torah, holidays, rituals, feasts, and other vital traditions in this, the world's oldest monotheistic religion. We also learn about Judaism's three main branches (Orthodox, Conservative, Reform), plus pious and non-practicing Jews. Additionally, Wouk examines his own perspective. The result is an informative and personal look at Judaism, particularly in the USA.Some note that Judaism has changed somewhat since this book arrived in the late 1950's; today there's more ultra-Orthodox, non-practicing, even messianic Jews. Still, this is an informative, valuable book. Readers might also enjoy Wouk's popular novels, including THE CAINE MUTINY and WINDS OF WAR."
5,Herman's Introspection,"A vibrantly worded work that focuses on Judaism from the very educated, yet personalized view of Herman Wouk. This work focuses on Herman's experiences with Judaism as a young adult, through his middle aged years in the late 1950s (with updates in the back of the book from the 60s and 80s, coupled with annotated updates when necessary, throughout the work). If you are an aspiring convert, or you practice Judaism of any sort, and you want an experiential view on the subject from another's perspective, this book is for you."
2,"Good on the what, weak on the why","Given this is not apologetics, an overload of what is done, with continual references to the lifelong study required, I felt I did not know much more about the reasons behind the liturgical rites and the precepts of this religion than I did before starting this book."
4,"Perfect fit, pity it wasn't supplied with the router","Even if you don't plan to use a guide bushing, this insert fills in that gaping hole around all but the largest bits very nicely. It fits snugly (flange first) but should be secured with a pair of 10-32 pan head screws for safety - it'd be nasty if this fell out and became a Hula-Hoop around the spinning bit. The screws are not supplied with this but I had a pair of 1/2"" long screws that worked fine (3/8"" would be a perfect fit). My Rockler 8mm dovetail bushing fit the center hole just right.The case that came with my router (the kit with the fixed and plunge bases) has a storage location for this item even though it doesn't come with."
2,Know What's Inside,"This text comes highly recommended as a classic by far too many creative writing and screenwriting teachers.Want to know if this book is for you? Read this passage:""In the second, by means of a contraction analogous to that which abbreviates a syllogism to an enthymeme, this undecided power is but an attribute of the persecutor himself.""The entire book reads this way, so if that works for ya, you'll love this book. If it doesn't, you'll need to look elsewhere."
3,A Useful Reference,"I don't quite understand how Polti came to classify the plots in this book the way he did. It made little sense to me. Nevertheless, I do see it as a useful reference for writers stuck for ideas. For my own part, I was able to think of some ideas which Polti did not seem to cover, even when I thought of his classifications as 'general categories', umbrellas under which every conceivable plot could fall."
1,Just don't buy this,"The problem with these new-fangled showerheads is that everything is made of plastic, including the showerhead holster. This makes no sense, especially when the showerhead in question is quite large and heavy. The one I ordered broke *less than a day* after I'd installed it, so I had to return it for a refund. I can't urge you strongly enough to avoid this product at all costs, but I appreciate the time you took to read this little review."
5,I love the settings!,"I agree that at some angles the showerhead has a tendency to fall out of its holder, but if you have a regular sized shower this shouldn't be a problem. The only reason it's been an issue for me is that my shower is quite small, and I angle the showerhead away from me while I'm soaping up. When I have it in the regular, right-in-front-of-me position, I have had no difficulty in keeping it in the holder--and of course most of the time I'm using it, it's not in the holder, anyway! There is leaking periodically, but I have found that if I rotate the holder clockwise (just hold the showerhead in one hand and take hold of the hose at the end near the holder and rotate the holder once clockwise and then untwist the hose--quite simple; takes a few seconds), the leaking stops. To me, these issues are minor and work-aroundable. The important thing is that I love the settings. I use several of them almost every time I shower."
3,It's quite heavy....but solid construction,"The shower head seems well constructed, but I was surprised how heavy it is. I had an existing mount which pivots up/down for your desired level and it was not strong enough to hold it up. I rigged it so it wont fall down now as I wanted keep it stationary anyway. Otherwise a good product. Nice selection of sprays."
1,HORRIBLE,This product shouldnt even deserve one star. A soon as I installed it it cracked the next day and started leaking bad. A few days later the water pressure was really BAD. To top it all off the freakin handle is huge. Even for somebody with big hands it wouldnt feel comfortable.
1,Pollenex,I was really looking forward to this item. But I am disappointed in it. The shower head handle does not want to stay in the holder.
4,Great Showerhead,"This is a great showerhead. This is light and easy to install. I installed mine on a walk in tub. I like having 9 settings. The water use is effective I even shower and shave (using aEmjoi RotoShave AP-3RS Rechargeable Electric Razor).It also is a effective with hot water use. I have showered for 30 minutes and still had warm water. This is light weight, and rubberized on the back. I like and enjoy this product. I enjoy using it and I have Cerebral Palsy being disabled I find it east to change the type of spray easy and quick."
3,"informative, but not very fun to read","I do not recommend this book to people looking for light, entertaining reading, unless you really love the Gilded Age. Even if you do want to read about this period of history, I do not find this the most easily read book. (America in the Gilded Age by Sean Dennis Cashman is slightly more accessible.) However, it does provide a good deal of information about what was happening in the United States from 1877-1890 (the presidencies, industrialism, labor movements, immigration, Populism, etc.). If you're looking for info for your American history class (as most people reading this review probably are), this book is worth checking out."
3,Good Rental,Pretty good movie....acting was good....storyline was pretty good.....the ending was good.....Nothing was great...nothing was bad.I'm glad we rented it.
2,"Ripoff-y, not very original or good","It's a ripoff-y tearjerker with bad acting by Anne Hathaway and Dianne Wiest, tho the other actors did well with a limited script. It's not at all what it seems at first, a conspiracy theory movie -- not that that would have been an improvement, it's just that this particular paranormal theme is done, and it has the same ending twist *******************SPOILER AHEAD **************************** as the Sixth Sense, without the better acting that makes that movie watchable. Hathaway here plays an annoying character, yes, but also plays her badly, imo, making it doubly hard to watch. I know the ending was supposed to be heartwarming, but it just didn't convince me."
2,seen it all before,"didn't we already see this in ""Lost"" series????? It's exactly same just A LOT shorter! Stolen theme. That's why I gave it a 2. And it goes a bit slow anyway. I mean it was a bit unexpected ending even though I've seen the series but it's exactly same idea as the LOST"
4,Passengers,"Very suspenseful movie. Keeps you guessing throughout. I really enjoyed it. Have watched it more than once, it gets better with re-viewing."
3,a la The Others but without the intrigue,"This is a thriller that is supposed to have twists ad turns and keep the viewer guessing, but in the first 45 minutes of the movie I just couldn't bring myself to care about the characters. The only reason I kept watching the film is because I have tremendous respect for the leads - Anne Hathaway and Patrick Wilson. I didn't particularly care for Hathaway's character's fate, but after the first set up of the movie, I realized the feel of the film that was very reminiscent of The Others. What intrigued me the most about this movie, however, was the idea of purgatory and how one must come into terms with their own mortality and death."
3,A True Flame-Out!,"I had higher hopes for this after reading some of the reviews here on Amazon. I've never been that impressed with Annes's acting ability since I'm not a woman and since she mostly makes ""chick flicks"". So, I found the plot to be slooow moving and a little stiff. The acting was well, slightly morbid...pun, yes indeed!Anyway, three stars for the ending which was a surprise. But just so you know, this is fiction and has nothing to do with reality."
1,Major disappointment,"I am a big fan of ghost stories, and was intrigued by the ads. Watched today and had to fast forward through much of the movie. It's very boring. Don't bother."
3,We've seen this before,"What happens here is nothing new. spoilers...........spoilersspoilersspoilersspoilersspoilersThese people find out, one by one, that they are no longer living. The performances are good enough but the story is not original."
3,"Slow movie, no payoff.","Slight spoiler: David Morse was the captain in ""The Langoliers"" too. If you see this man flying your plane, get off."
2,A plot already seen,"Lame, boring and predictable. Aren't we getting tired of the same plot in these blockbuster movies. The only reason I gave it two stars is because it features the always gorgeous Anne Hathaway."
2,"pass on ""Passengers""","I really liked the movie's concept and the artistic director's beautiful and tight color scheme but overall this movie is **not worth** your time or money. The director claimed this was a ""medical thriller and a romance"" but it was neither exciting nor romantic. The main character Claire falls ""in love"" with a pushy passenger named Eric who challenges her to step outside of her safe box. There's nothing wrong with this idea per se but Eric was arrogant and reckless and I just couldn't see a smart and sweet girl like Claire falling for him. The characters spent a lot of time running around in circles -- the script needed more momentum and direction. Thumbs down!!!"
4,good wrestling shoe,"I bought 2 pairs of these wrestling shoes for my 2 sons that wrestle. They say the shoes are very comfortable, get good traction and breathe well. I like that they look nice, are durable and they don't smell after they are done wrestling. They still look like new, even after the season is over."
4,Pert Memoir,I grew up in the Bethesda-Chevy Chase area but was slightly younger that Holland. Her story reminded me of my of my own teenage angst. Well written.
5,When All The World Was Young: A Memoir,I did not know of Barbara Holland's work until I saw this book advertised in a catalog and decided to order it. I was charmed and immediately became a fan. Having grown up during approximately the same decade(s) I can closely identify with the feelings and emotions that made her the fascinating charachter she has become. I am online right now to order the rest of her books and am looking forward to many hours of enjoyment.
2,Don't waste your money. Get the Chicago instead,"I bought the New World Spanish/English dictionary for college, and hated it. It seems to be missing a lot of words. Looking words up feels more frustrating, because they are often missing, and because this dictionary follows the practice of putting ""ch-"" after ""co-"" and the other C words. It's hard to explain. I just don't love the New World the way I love my Chicago.The Chicago English-Spanish / Español-Inglés was recommended by my highschool Spanish teacher -- I don't regret buying it. Classmates who bought other ditionaries (such as the Oxford, I think it was) often needed to borrow mine. It simply has more of the words we needed to look up and is fun to use and browse through. For example, the New World has the verb reference section in the middle of the dictionary, but the Chicago has it in front, where it's quicker to locate."
5,An Excellent Camera,"I purchased a Minolta HTsi Plus camera in October 2000 and have shot an average of two rolls of film per week with this camera since then. I have nothing but praise for this camera. The HTsi Plus has never failed me in any way. I suggest you buy the body only. Don't spend money on a 28-80 lens that may come in some camera kits; rather put that money into a lens that gives you much more flexibility, like a 28-200 lens. I use Sigma 28-200 and 70-300 auto focus lenses, and I can report nothing but satisfaction, reliability, and ease of use. I had considered purchasing a more expensive SLR camera, but today I am pleased I did not, for this camera is perfect for me, an experienced but amateur photographer. I have had loads of fun with this camera and taken hundreds of wonderful photos. I recommend the Minolta HTsi Plus without hesitation or qualification."
3,Helpful but not,"I have had this camera for a few weeks or so and it is great, but has down sides. This is my first ""good"" camera meaning an SLR, but have used them before. It is great when you use the AF (automatic) features because it shows you after the pictures are developed about lighting correctness, visual, etc. The down side is, unless you know about how lighting affects the exposure of the picture the manual features do not help much. But it is a decent camera for someome who wants to learn because it shows you the settings in the view finder in the AF mode."
1,Not a good buy,"I bought this product and it could not play on my computer, I had to dig up my ole laptop that has windows 98 and that was the only way to get some parts of the game to work, so this was a waste of money for me and i never got the chance to return it so, I lost. Other than that, I got the product within good time, that's the only good thing."
3,Not what I thought,"They are ok, but they are not what we used in the Army. They don't stretch like the GI ones."
2,Too short and not stretchy,"I used to have a neck gaiter from an army surplus store but at some point lost it. I bought this item as a replacement, and unfortunately it's quite different than the old one: It's a different, less soft and not at all stretchy material. And it is rather short (about 7 inches). So it works okay as a neck warmer or headband, but if you pull it up over your nose it's too short to still cover your neck. I would not order this again."
4,"Nice, but a little short","This is very warm for cold weather for about 30 minutes. I stayed repeatedly in 0 degree weather and this kept my neck and face warm for about 30 minutes. If you need to spend longer than that outside I would recommend something heavier.The length is a little short. I wore a jacket with a very high collar so it wasn't a huge deal for me, but if your jacket doesn't zip tightly up to your chin try and find something longer."
3,Alright for the price,"The neck gaiter was kind of short for me. Doesn't stretch and the material feels hard and uncomfortable. But for the price I got it, can't really expect much."
3,Tough read,"The subject is great and the men deserve our respect. However the book is written in there own words. That means that the book does not always flow for easy reading. Poor grammar, poor spelling, and run on sentences make the book less than enjoyable. It would appear that the author just typed exactly what was said."
4,"Good, Almost Great.","The interviews are ace and remarkable in their clarity and insight. These are let down by the lack of context as to the battle within the wider campaign and a map or two would have enabled the reader to see the landscape and the positions, both would have added to the understanding of the action taken by each of the medal winners. Another example is the cover photo, listed as US Army coming ashore on Tinian Island in the Pacific Islands, which is sort of correct but Tinian is one of the northern Mariana islands (next to Sapian which was a major Marine victory) and was the home of the 509th Bomb Group which lead the atomic raids on Japan, a small detail yet one that would context this good book even better."
1,Not even a tribute to staind...,This (or the music that I sampled) isnt even a tribute to staind....it's a tribute to Rage Against the Machine. I don't know if this is Amazons fault or that this band is getting away with this?Very confused.
1,Tardville of Music Srikes Again...,"OK, I'm a big Staind fan, and I thought this CD might be ok at first. Boy was I wrong. I hadn't even got through half the first track, and I stopped the so-called music, took the CD out and snapped it in two! (I actually did this). I mean, Rage Against the Machine sucks to begin with, but what them trying to sing Staind's lyrics sounded like crap! What this CD really is is an insult to Staind. It sounded like Rage was trying to rap Aaron's lyrics. Anyway, if Aaron had sampled this CD, I would have hoped he'd have gone and kicked Rage Against the Machine's a$$. That's all I have to say about this wanna-be rock band's insulting tribute to Staind, which is by far, one of the best ""true"" hard rock bands out there. (Sup' to all my homy Staind fans round da' world)!"
4,Uh,-1 star for making a tribute album for a band that has only beenout for a little over 4 years and what the hell is the guy on the bottom of me talking about? The bands on this are great
2,Does Not Cover The Full Scope of Technical Writing,"This book was a required text for an introductory Technical Writing course. I would not have purchased it otherwise. The emphasis of the book is on writing standard business reports and does not cover the full scope of modern Technical Writing. (no white papers, no procedural manuals, no scientific articles, etc.)The book is wordy and poorly organized. Several editing errors were spotted.I personally feel there are far better references than this for technical writing.Try:The Non-Designer's Design BookUntechnical Writing - How to Write About Technical Subjects and Products So Anyone Can Understand (Untechnical Press Books for Writers Series)Microsoft Manual of Style for Technical Publications Third Edition"
4,great condition,"This book came in great condition and arrived on time. It was previously a library book, and did not have any writing or highlighting inside."
1,BAD REGISTERATION CODES :(,I bought this package and when i installed them the registeration codes worked but when i tried to register the games for online play the told me it is already registered for someone else !!!!!?????I shocked and up to now EA didnt reply to me or solve my problem so simply i lost my moeny on this useless game packageDONT TRY IT OR BUY IT
4,B-RaD,"Very Satisfied with this bundle pack. Graphics smooth on my toshiba laptop with 1.7 qig pcu; 128 meg intel video card. Nascar was not compatible with my video card but the other games were still fun to play. Rosters aren't up to date, but i'm not a big sports guy so that doesnt matter. over all, fun game's and great deal in this bundle."
2,Look Elsewhere,"This work is confused. McInerny tries to separate the logic of analogy from its real foundation in being. His criticisms of Cajetan just don't seem to hit the mark. The confusion can be summed up in his statement that ""analogy"" is itself used analogously. Well, if there is not some sense in which ""analogy"" is used univocally, then ""analogy"" loses any definite meaning. It becomes simply the night in which all cows are black. If you want to read something better by McInerny, read his translation and commentary on Aquinas' Disputed Question on Virtue. Ethics appears to be his forte."
2,Lackluster,"This work is confused. He tries to separate the logic of analogy from its real foundation in being. If you want to read something better by McInerny, read his translation and commentary on Aquinas' Disputed Question on Virtue. Ethics appears to be his forte."
3,waste of money,If you've never been a manager and never took any college classes after high school then this is the book for you.
2,Disappointed,"I, like a few other reviewers here, found the overly repetitive code snippets both confusing and, in most cases, utterly pointless.I have also yet to find any ""Tips"" which we are told are marked clearly throughout the book offering advice or demonstrating an easier way to do something (excluding the ""Tip"" that explains what ""Tips"" are!). Let me know if you find any others... Is this just another example of poor editing?It is a real pity, as overall the author presents some good examples. I would have liked the book to go a little more in-depth, but I guess there was little room left after the endless identical samples.2 stars simply because the book still manages to cover the basics, and the author shows plenty of promise for the future..."
2,Cryptic,"No plain English explanation of the reasoning behind the code. Assumes you'll understand what he means by ""adjacent sibling selectors"" and ""document tree"". I gleaned some knowledge by copying the examples and trial and error, but it was frustrating and tedious. If you're a programmer you might be able to decipher this book, but if you're a newbie you'll get a clearer introduction, with relevant details, from a book like ""HeadFirst HTML"" by Elisabeth and Eric Freeman."
4,"James Tadeo, Web Design Brampton",I work with Web sites every day and will need a reference now and again to get my work done. This book is handy and fits nicely in my pack and acts as my main reference for CSS. The examples are clear and build from the previous chapters. It also has an accompanying Web site that shows you what the CSS script will look like when implemented. I believe this is a good starter book and the price is just right.
2,"Very repetitive, disappointing","If you know nothing about CSS and you can find an inexpensive copy, this book will get you started, but there have to be better ""get started"" books. Probably good if someone needs a lot of simple, explicit examples though. The one place I had high hopes for the book was near the end where it dealt with using CSS to format ""printer friendly"" pages. I'm sure the code was OK, but there was no example of how to link a page formatted for the screen to one formatted for the printer. I was expecting some example of loading a second Style Sheet using the same page code."
3,"A start for begginers, but that's all.","A web designer/teacher suggested this book as a start. While I could already write a little CSS to get by, this book was good to show things that I hadn't learned yet. However, the book was a bit repetitive. It repeated code over and over in each section and only added a few lines of new code. While that's not completely terrible, I felt it was wasted space on the page!"
3,Disappointing book that could have been so much better,"I was so disappointed with this book. The sad fact is that with better editing, it could have been not only a great introduction to CSS, but a handy reference volume as well. Unfortunately that was not realized and the book fails greatly.The examples are poorly written, with un-necessary duplication of examples. The description of CSS elements, descriptors, etc could have been made much more clearly with some careful editing. Alas no such editing was done.I cannot recommend this book to a beginner as the content is not complete enough nor clear enough for learning. I can't really recommend this book to anyone for that matter because someone with more CSS experience would be better off with an O'Reilly book on the subject."
4,Great for beginners...,This book is an excellent starting point for those making the leap from styling with html to css. Not only does it break down core principles into easy to digest chunks of information it also teaches some practical methods and techniques you'll actually put into practice.The thing I like best about it though is that it's organized really well and contains a wealth of information so even after you've learned and mastered the basics of CSS you'll be able to come back to this book later on and it will be a great reference book for things you need quick refreshers on.
3,OK locking gas cap,This locking gas cap is just OK. Its made of all plastic so it would be easy to break into but will deter those without any tools. Clumsy but easy to lock and unlock. I use mine with a 2009 Toyota Tacoma truck.
1,They will send you the wrong size cap!,"I specified the year, make, and model of my vehicle to purchase a locking gas cap and this is what was suggested that would fit my 3/4 ton gas Silverado. It arrived and it didn't fit. I ended up giving it to a friend because the cost to ship it back would have almost equaled the price of this gas cap. It seemed very cheaply made so it was probably for the best as I ended up going to O'Reilly Auto Parts where they sold me the correct gas cap. It was less than $20 out the door, but it is a much better than what this gas cap is.Skip this and go to an auto parts store."
5,Works,Purchased for a 2010 Camaro. 600mi later still no lights or error codes. Make sure to follow directions and you'll be good.
2,Works but not for security,"I work in the automotive parts industry and must say this cap is not the best choice for anyone looking for a secure cap.Here is why: The cap is plastic, I had it installed on my 2008 Mustang and it was 'popped' (broke off) with a screwdriver in less than 3 seconds. The material is very cheap and you get what you pay for. It would be best to upgrade to a steel or metal cap for the best protection.However it did fit properly, and the locking mechanism is simple and easy to turn with no friction.If you are buying this to prevent people from stealing your gas then I would highly reconsider."
4,This cap WORKS on the 2010 Camaro SS,I have this cap installed on my 2010 Camaro SS. It works perfectly. Decent product. 1 caveat: Lube the lock with graphite or very light oil (I use Ballistol) every few months to keep it working smooth. A little goes a long way.
2,Product Quality - Poor,Ordered for a 2012 Toyota Tacoma. Product has failed after ~ 5 months. Product is almost exclusively made of plastic which is unfortunate. Mechanism actuated by the key which is supposed to enable freewheeling of the top of the cap no longer disengages.Would not recommend
3,we`ll see...,"After reading several reviews on this product I have to agree with most comments in regards to the locking fuel cap being poorly made. The Cap fits fine for the application. However the key mechanism is flimsy at best. The quality of the plastic components are not what I remember a Stant Locking Fuel cap to be. They def cheapened out on their manufacturing process`s.I gave the Stant Locking Fuel cap a 3 star rating only bc it does fit and is doing what the intended use is for. I do feel that if someone wants to remove the cap by force, they absolutely can. I primarily purchased this product based on Stant`s reputation in the Auto market, but this one leaves myself a bit disappointed. This is being used as a deterrent to help prevent vandals from pouring anything foreign into the tank. It does operate correctly when following the unlocking/locking procedures."
3,Quality is so so.,I had one of these on my previous vehicle. I was looking forward to this one for my new Honda Element. The quality from my previous Stant Locking Fuel Cap has decreased. My last one lasted close to 8 years. This one feels like it won't last 2 years. I am worried when it fails that I won't be able to get into my gas tank.
1,Don't Buy,"This ""locking"" gas cap has been a BIG disappointment. It does not lock or unlock easily, and it is a pain getting it to do either. I wish I had not bought it.I ended up throwing it in the garbage. DON'T BUY!"
3,"Meh, its ok i guess...","Cheap, lock/tumbler is low quality and proves to be difficult at times to unlock with out two hands (tricky when theres some depth to the gas cap from the body like on a truck). Even though it seemed ready to snap apart at any time or the key break off inside, this cap held up for over 2 years before i opted to go back to the OEM cap. Never any problems with it sealing either which surprised me."
2,Poorly Made,"This gas lock is VERY cheaply made! Turned it the wrong way with the key in ONE time wrong, and the whole assembly/lock mechanism CAME OUT ON THE KEY!The exact same thing happened to me the moment I went in to fill up for the first time with the new cap. Spend a few extra dollars or check with the car manufacturer for their model. Might be worth it."
1,False Security,"The lock on these caps is mereley a placebo and a false sense of security. I was having fuel stolen from my vehicle on a regular basis and figured the $20 to lock the cap was worth it. Fuel theft continued shortly after so I decided to see how difficult it was to pick the lock. With a simple Google search I found that a bent paperclip or bobby pin would release the lock. I also discovered that if you jam a similarly sized key in and turn to the unlock position... the lock cylinder comes out and the cap is in the unlock position with no damage to the entire product. The cylinder will then simply pop back in with absolutely no sign of tampering.Not only that, but the cylinder number is etched directly on the lock bezel and keys, so if you have a repeat offender all they need to do is merely shoplift a very small set of keys that match (possibly dozens or hundreds) and they have valid access to any number of ""locked"" fuel caps."
4,Works well on 2011 Toyota Tacoma,"This model fit my 2011 Toyota Tacoma nicely, and without triggering any emissions sensors / check-engine light. Toyota do not provide an OEM locking option and the dealer and online team declined to recommend any third-party product.Feels a little cheaply made but it's a somewhat-useful deterrent. I do like the fact that it doesn't need the key in to relock it."
2,Doesn't fit,"Got this locking fuel cap for my Chevy Silverado 1500 (2005). Did a lot of research regarding which exact Stant fuel cap to order for my make/model. It isn't the best quality fuel cap I have encountered, but it works as far as the locking mechanism goes and seems sturdy enough. Seemed to fit ok and it locks and unlocks just fine so far. However, within 3 days of putting it on my truck, the ""check engine light"" came on with a notification to ""tighten fuel cap"". Can't really tighten it any tighter as, once it is ""locked"", it just spins. So, it doesn't fit correctly even though it is the correct part number for my particular vehicle. I guess I will put the original cap back on and see if I can find another locking cap with a better fit."
4,Easy Reference,"If you have no idea how to write research report, read this book and you will have a basic concept how to start. It is a simple and easy reference for beginners. Not very thick but useful. Easy to carry with you. Also, with steps and example show you how to write term papers or reports."
1,Don't waste your money.,"I'm a fairly intelligent early adaptor and I have been completely disappointed with this product. I live on South Beach in Miami in a high rise, so I was not entirely surprised that this would not function wirelessly, but even after I laid down cable and hard-wired it, no luck. Or more precisely, inadequate performance. Lame, lame, lame. A total waste of money. Wait until 2010."
1,1000 song limit!!!,"I am currently on the phone with DLink tech support who informs me that if you have more than 1000 songs in a shared folder then the DSM320 will crash. This is a known issue and they have no idea when or if they can fix it.The Media Server itself is quite horrible. I upgraded to the latest version and still am not able to add my music folder to be shared. After scanning the directory for about 20 minutes the software unceremoniously crashes with no clues as to why.The tech support people are about as good as the product itself. Their solution to my problems are ""Go to the store and return it."" If tversity doesn't make this thing work then I guess I will take their advice."
4,Windows Media Connect makes the DSM-320 sing!,"A lot of the reviewers are dissatisfied by some things that are now remedied. Windows Media Connect(downloadable at the Microsoft web site) replaces the media server provided by D-Link. It now allows playing of media downloaded from online stores supported by Windows Media Connect (alas, not I-tunes). Play order from ripped CD's is now maintained. Some minor glitches still remain, but I'm very satisifed with it."
2,Great concept. Poor implementation.,"The D-Link DSM-320 is a great product in theory. However, the actual product leaves much to be desired. Basically, this is just a confirmation of what everyone else here has been saying. The remote buttons are barely responsive, it is unable to play 90% of the files of each of the formats that it claims to play, shuffle is useless without setting up a playlist, and other ""basic"" functions are missing. This product was definately released to early. An as an early adopter, I got burned this time. I will be returning this thing tomorrow."
2,Why would you pay this much?,"Why pay over 300$ for this product, when you can get an Xbox 360 or PS3 and do exactly what this does (stream media from DLNA compatible devices) + stream netflix, go online with a browser (PS3), play games (with game system discs) and much more."
3,"Room for improvement, but still pretty good","I bought this primarily so I could play music from my PC over my stereo system for the house. It works well and the sound is good (I have a D-Link router so no problems with compatibility). However, I have just two complaints:1) The software interface on the PC needs a lot of improvement. This is where you designate various folders containing multimedia content to be accessed by the DSM-320. However, the software has very little functionality beyond simply designating folders. For example, it is a real pain to create play lists.2) On not one but TWO units that I tried, the component video outputs did not work. I returned the first unit and discovered the same problem with the replacement. If you buy one of these, I would suggest checking those jacks first thing.All in all, however, I think this is a solid buy for the money (shop around, btw; I got mine for $100)."
4,Only a couple of hours to set up,"Okay, I'm not a geek and I'm not a Music Purist, but I had already set up my own 802.11g WiFi network. I have a few significant problems with this unit, more on that in a minute. BUT it does what I wanted -- make it possible for me to listen to my thousands of ripped songs on my real stereo system.The fact that it uses WEP and not WPA meant I had to go back and reconfigure my WiFi security setup, which took the most time (and had me tearing my hair out). Annoying as all get out, and since this device comes from a wireless gear vendor you'd think they'd have done the right thing here. And yes the remote is quite dreadful. But once I figured out how to save all my WMP playlists in a format that the device understood, things worked pretty well."
1,Not Usable In Its Current Form,"The DSM-320 is not ready for consumer use and I'd wait for D-Link to update the server software before I would even consider purchasing one. The current version lacks even the most basic media player functionality and really doesn't do justice to what appears to be an exception device from a hardware standpoint. Current problems with the D-Link DSM-320 include:1. Unable to play more than one song in a row. The player stops after each song on an album. Must build custom playlists for each album in your collection.2. Repeated ""Unsupported file format"" on standard MP3 files. These same files play on every other mp3 player I own.3. Unresponsive remote - have to hit each button 2-3 times before the entry will register.4. No Divx support."
1,Wireless connection dropouts,"When using Wi-Fi for a connection, this device skips frequently when playing back audio. No matter how strong my wireless connection I had this problem. Regardless of any of the other features, this makes the device completely unusable as far as I am concerned.I've used similar devices that did not have this problem, but had other problems like poor UPnP compatibility (Linksys WMA-11B), so this is clearly not an insurmountable problem in general."
1,D-Link should do their homework first!,"The D-Link DSM-320 is by far the worst piece of electronic equipment I ever came across in my over 20 years of computer usage. Fortunately, returning items to Amazon is rather easy, so I sent the device back after a few attempts to get a picture on my TV. Well, I was following the instructions and even used the Ethernet connection rather then going wireless (having read some of the feedbacks about weak signal reception).However, even with a wire, the D-Link DSM-320 did not find the media-server on the computer. Well, it did after some attempts to re-install the device. The reason for this might be that I use Linksys networking equipment but this should not be a constraint, I presume. The quality of the D-Link is very poor, though the box looks nice. The server software is even worst, since it does not even open the folders, which one selects in the setup mode. All-in-all, D-Link should make their homework before brining such a device to the market!"
1,Stay away from this unit!,"This media player is great.... when it works, which is rarely! I have had this product for over a year now and have had nothing but problems with it. The only way I got acceptable performance (meaning it doesn't lock up on me) is by ditching the wireless connection and going with a hardwired setup. I tried two different wireless routers, but the router didn't seem to be the problem. I also ditched the server software, which would hammer my machine, and went with Tversity instead. After all of that, it was finally working well, until all of a sudden it died completely. Since I've had it for over a year, DLink tech support and customer service said too bad. Their only solution was to offer to sell me another unit - I don't think so!"
4,Great Product,"After reading tons of review of D-Link DSM-320 mostly negative ones, I was hesitant at first to buy this product...not that I had not come across a few four stars. I decided to try it anyways today.Installation was a breeze...took me about 7 minutes (and yes... timed it!!). I have 128-bit WEP-enabled my router...so it was just the matter of punching in the the security key.The only thing i miss is the photo slide show random transitions....would have been great Otherwise...its a great product...works flawless for me."
1,Junk,"This was recommended to me by a friend and I have to say it's the worst thing he ever suggested. I just took this thing out into the street and destroyed it. I never could get it to play music without stopping and starting and almost every time I turned it on the ""No Server Found"" message came up and I had to reset all the settings."
3,Cutting out,The system was easy to hook up and get running. I wanted something to stream musicand run a slide show at the same time. I wasn't really interested in video streaming.It seems to work ok for the most part. It does like to cut out from time to time whilestreaming music. Almost to the point of being annoying. I've also got a Roku soundbridgebut I've never noticed the music cutting out like the D-Link does.
2,Underpowered...,"Unfortunately, I picked this unit up with much higher hopes than I should have.Setup was relatively simple. I know what I'm doing and I have an existing UPnP server on my network, so that made life a little easier. When you power the thing up for the first time, it steps you through network setup, locates UPnP servers, and makes it all go.However, once I got it running, I lost my optimism. Video was very choppy. It was completely unwatchable. I futzed with the settings on my router and UPnP server and video formats for a week before finally giving up."
2,"good for music, not for video","i bought this and quickly gave up on the included software. i then went with the tversity free software, which is miles better. however if you have a large divx xvid avi collection you wont be happy. some play. some dont. there's no telling until you try it, even hard wired, so its not a wireless bandwidth problem. i eventually gave up and returned it. who wants to spend all the time setting it up and wondering if it will work just to watch a video? instead i went with an old Xbox (at half the price as everyone is getting rid of them and going to the new 360), converted it to an Xbox media center (XBMC) and its genius. everything works no matter what...divx, xvid, ogg... and it can do so much else too (not to mention you can play games with an xbox if you want to). its not the simplest route but its 100 years past whats commercially available now."
4,Go straight for Microsoft WMC,"Although it only took about 5 minutes to get the device on my network (it's a bit fiddly entering a 128-bit WEP key using the remote!) I then struggled for a couple of hours trying to get it to see my computer. After resetting the unit a couple of times, downloading the latest firmware and re-installing the server software on my PC, I resorted to a Google search and came across some references to Microsoft Windows Media Connect, which also mentioned the DSM-320. I downloaded version 2.0 from the Microsoft website, upon which my PC detected the DSM-320 and asked which folders I wanted to make available. Seconds later, I was streaming content to my stereo downstairs without any problems whatsoever.My advice? If you're running Windows XP with Service Pack 2, don't waste your time with the D-Link software supplied in the box but go straight for Microsoft Windows Media Connect. The DSM-320 appears to be a well built, well specified product for a reasonable price."
3,"Ok, but not great","I really had high hopes for this product but am a little disappointed. It doesn't always find the server so you have to restart a few times before it will work. The video playback is jerky, that was the main reason I bought this thing so I could watch video on my tv and it is a neither smooth process or a good quality (and yes the video is fine on the PC). I thought that these problems might have been because of my wireless network so I ran cable and hooked the thing directly into my router, it made no difference. It works great for music, but I have yet to figure out how to get it to view pictures. I hope they can work out the bugs on this thing someday because it's a great idea."
4,Easy to install but one minor glitch,"I won't add to what is already in the other reviews other than this unit has been able to play every .avi that I have thrown at it so far. Seems that they have added a good number of codecs via the firmware upgrades. (Mine came with version 1.07 installed.)There was one installation glitch that would be troublesome to the less network savvy. You can't seem to enter the SSID of your network manually, in spite of an option to do so. The on-screen keyboard would not appear. I had to change my router settings to broadcast the SSID before it was detected. Fortunately, that won't compromise your network security if it is also set for WEP encryption.The rest was no problem."
3,Media Router,I was personally not complety impressed with the router as a whole. It does seem to have some reception problems and will hick-up often. Also you cannot run your microwave without causing it to lock up. It severed its purpose over all well and is a great alternative to making the investment to acutalling installing a computer in the living room to connect directly to your system. It has overall been the best of its kind that I have experienced thus far.
4,Extremely quick install...very pleased so far...,"D-Link DSM-320 Wireless Media Player, Audio/Photo/Video, 802.11gI was nervous before buying this product because some of the reviews said it was difficult to set up. I TOTALLY DO NOT AGREE. This literally took me 15 minutes, at most, to get it installed and set up to start listening to some music and watching some pictures. I love that it is wireless and being able to listen to my PC music through the stereo is excellent. I did not give it 5 stars because I just received it yesterday and used it for maybe 2 hours. I am very pleased so far..."
2,D-Link is quiet about Firmware updates,"How do you know what these firmware updates are fixing, or breaking, when Dlink does not seem to post firmware information on the website?I've given this product a try before, but I was not waiting for ""future"" fixes for features that were prominently displayed on the box. If I could see what these firmware updates were doing, I would be more inclined to give this product another shot.I really hope that Dlink improves the server software. It was a real pain to have to manually force a rescan of the directories whenever a change was made to the file structure, or files were added to the existing directories, and the interface was terrible. I could have written better software and I'm in pharma-research."
3,good product but bad sosftware,"The product was nice, the problem is ths software , there are not many options, if i can buy a new ad more powefull software his will thebest product"
2,RunMan,"The server software really stinks. I'll say it agian, the server software really stinks. The remote is slow, small and really stinks.The only reason for the two stars is the fact the I got the unit up and running in short order..... It then took several hours of additional work to get the video portion of the unit working.After fighting with this thing all weekend long, I gave up on the unit Sunday and took it back."
1,It simply does not work - Read the reviews,"I bought the DSM-320 some time ago and have tried everything in an effort to make it work - latest firmware, reset, relocate, etc. etc. I've finally pulled it out of my system after watching it collect dust for several months. I highly recommend against purchasing this POS. In fact I will give mine away to anyone who cares to pay for the shipping..."
3,D-Link OSs are very bad,"Dlink operating systems are very bad, they seem to be developed by complicated designers and programmers, always a lot of bugs so you need new firmware to avoid half of the bugs.They devices work but you need a lot of hours dedicated to understand their OS. So if you are not an IT expert, do not buy them."
2,Not ready yet,"I am very disappointed im this product so far. I have all DLind equipment, and it recognized my network perfectly. However, it has lots of other problems and badly needs a firmware upgrade. It has frozen several times, requiring that I unplug it to restart. It occassionally stops in the middle of a song. Most disappointing is that it cannot seem to read artist or album info on most of my music (mp3 or wma), and cannot play more than one song at a time. I called tech support and they told me that is the best the server can do right now (contrary to adverstisments and the manual). The shuffle and repeat buttons never work. Wait til they fix all this before you buy, this is an awful failure so far."
3,"Some good, some bad -- I'm enjoying it on balance","There's both bad and good to say about this one.Ok here are the downsides I have experienced:1. Crummy reception, weak range. I had to move my router much closer to the unit before I could get clear signal with no dropouts, and the video feeds STILL tend to choke.2. Miserable onscreen display, finding files is inordinately slow and messy.3. Cranky remote control. The unit sometimes jams for no discernible reason4. Tech support -- the guys you call haven't got a clue.On the other hand --I enjoy AOL radio and Live365 radio (available with the latest firmware update).MP3 files from my hard disk play OK, once I can locate them.This unit will do some useful things for you if you are willing to give it some TLC. It's reasonably priced and looks OK in a stack of sound/video components."
5,Get Listening to Online Music Today,"I also bought this so that I can listen to online radio via my entertainment center. This device works great for that. For all thsoe who are using wireless ... try wired, even if the wire looks bad, just try it, it's much more reliable and has more bandwidth available. It just makes more sense.I like the user interface even though some things a little confusing. You get over that in about 2 minutes of using it. No biggy. Also make sure to upgrade the firmware if it doesn't automatically. It's a nice feature.Also make sure all your MP3s have the right ID3 tags. Otherwise you wont know what songs you are about to play."
2,"Lot's of potential, but not ready for prime time yet","I just bought this device, and it's definately got a lot going for it in the ""wow, cool!"" factor. Unfortunately . . . it really isn't ready for public release yet. D-link insists that most of the known issues will be worked out with software fixes . . . but the units on shelves now are just a buggy mess.Most of the problems have already been described in other reviews, but I'm unable to get a solid wireless signal to the device and have no desire to run a hard-wired line to my living room at the moment. I've tried a new router, replacement antenna, and moving the equipment around as much as conceivably possible . . . to no effect. Video and Audio still skip too much.Also, for what video I could actually get to play, much of it is in widescreen and the device has no options for adjusting aspect ratio, so the picture's just stretched vertically over the whole screen. A letterboxing option on the remote would be a nice addition."
3,Unexciting,"I bought this a year ago-- set it up (relatively painless) then promptly forgot all about it. The other day I was looking for something and found this unit and couldn't remember what it was.The fact is that this item has limited functionality. If you are not interested in signing up for a number of pay services it is pretty much limited to playing internet radio stations and showing pictures from the computer to the television. It doesn't even support plain old AVI. D-Link did suggest that I might like to download a trial version of Nero Encoder to reencode my AVI files. Actually there are open source and freeware products out there that will do the same thing.This seems to be a marketing opportunity for online music services and software companies. It also does not support iTunes but it does supports Play for Sure from Microsoft. Unfortunately, the Play for Sure sites I looked out failed to excite me at all.This was clearly not one of D-link's better ideas."
2,THIS PRODUCT IS A JOKE!,"Everybody else hit the nail on the head. DLINK is selling a product that is apparantely still in development. I have been unable to get a single MPG or VOB file to play more than 13 minutes into the file. At that point it locks up. Dlink takes 1 week to offer back lame responses. I'm on the latest 1.02 firmware, and the server software is still at 1.0 -- definately, definately, definately AVOID this expensive nonworking product."
1,One star is too high for this D-ink device. Loathing is too kind.,"D-ink Leave off the ""L"" for this thing is Lame. If you can get this running out of the box don't worry D-ink will issue a software update and you will likely install it rendering this device defunct. Get ready for persistent software re installations. If the device seems to be working don't update anything!Even with a hardwired network connection the picture is often choppy and often falls out of sync with the audio.Don't waste your time with this product. I have fought with this device for over a year and no longer use it.Good luck to any future buyers. I look forward to your one star reviews."
1,Waste of GeekSquad/My time & Money!,"The details in the bad experiences are clear in the other reviews. I had GeekSquad come out after taking two of them back to store because I couldn't get them to work and tech support for D-Link said it was a bad unit - both times. So for quick fix, I called GeekSquad to come put it in, I thought easy. After 5 hours of trouble shooting, conference calls, tweaking, etc., etc., they left scratching their heads. COULD NOT MAKE IT WORK! They even set up a temporary network with a barebones pc and it still would not work. THIS THING IS GOING BACK! WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY. Which is a shame, because it sounded like such a great idea."
1,totally junk !!!!`,wireless doesnt work and ethernet still doesn't workwasted an hour ... I have tried another $99 similar product from huggcences which works great except it's wired no wireless
4,Met my expectation except ...,"This device is what I've been waiting for. I have thousands and thousands of pictures and mp3 songs in my 300 GB shared networked storage device (Maxtor NAS H01R300) and I set this media player up in about 30 min. At first, my music wasn't working then flipping through their menu, found out that I have to change my audio port from composite to Digital Optic since that is what I connected to my receiver. Only thing that is not working or couldn't figure out so far is that I can't start a slide show of my pictures. I have to manually click remote control button to flip through pictures. This is kinda pain to see 100s of pictures while I'm eating dinner or whatever. I think it's a bug in their firmware and hope they can fix this issue soon. I guess I am keeping this unit since it does everything else it advertised."
3,A Good Start,"Not a bad device in total but it has so many issues. I want a device that will adapt to my way of working not the other way around. After spending 10 days of developing work arounds I decided to look elswhere. For the price the DSM-320 is a great machine. I am willing to pony up a few more bucks to get something a bit more powerfull that can handle a more varied set of video formats and stream higher bit rate files. If you want to stream MP3 and lower bit rate MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 videos the DSM-320 is great. If you are looking to support DIVX, DVD quality MPEG-2 captures and HDTV content this is not the player for you. All in all this is an entire new product segment and for a first generation device at a low price point the DSM gets the job done. If you want more processing power I would suggest looking elsewhere. If all you want to do is stream MP3, JPEGs and MPEG-2 at 2Mbit per second and less this is your horse."
5,Awesome player,"I am totally impressed with the D-Link media player. I use to hook up my laptop to my TV and stereo system to listen to the internet radio or listen to music files from my wireless network, but now it is a thing of the past. Thanks to my media player. The online radio and watching photos is a blast. Watching videos at first was a little choppy at times and some of my videos I couldn't even watch for whatever reason. Since I have downloaded the latest and greatest firmware along with windows media connect software, I'm able to watch all my movies like watching it from my DVD player. For those reading this, I strongly recommend that you download WINDOWS MEDIA CONNECT from the Microsoft website. It enhances the streaming of your videos, music files, and photos with a wireless connection. This digital media player is off the hook. Get it!! I hope you enjoy it as much as I do and my family enjoys it as well."
3,Sonic pvc keychain,"It was just something my son was into. He had it for the first day and then afterward lost it. It's pretty well made, the hook is good and strong. Normal key chain."
4,"New Times, New Bowie","I've heard many things about this album from all sorts of sources. Many rave on and on about ""Earthling"" (a great album to be sure) but then dismiss ""Hours"" because it went in a totally new direction. However, that is precisely why I love ""Hours"". It takes Bowie's music in a totally new direction, adding one more style to the large Bowie collection. If you're looking for the hard rock Bowie that was Earthling, you won't find it here. However, if you want something soft, soothing, yet still undeniably Bowie, this is for you! There is also something to be said about the multiple references to Bowie's past. It seems that this album and ""Scary Monsters"" of 1980 serve as ways for Bowie to let off all that's been building up over the years. Incredibly different, but still good. Now all we have to do is wait for the rumored jazz of ""Heathen""!"
2,Bowie is back -but an old one this time.,"Since Outside, Bowie became the new techno-jungle king, a vanguardist that push up the system with rupturists sounds. Earthling was his best album in the whole 90s, without a doubt. Hours was supposed to be the continuation of that new born man Bowie has made of himself, that one with orange hair and sensual voice, dressed in an England-flag suit, doing videos with Trent Reznor and all that stuff. But Hours is no more than a man revisiting his decadent past in the 80s, with boring and extremely long and dull songs. His voice dosent soud the same anymore; this time it is still and fakely high-toned. The new age aura of Thrursday Child doesent help very much (and the awful video neither). The only good song here is the not very original Whats really happening and Your pretty things are going to hell. The rest soud like Sting or something worse.-"
4,Perfections and Toss-aways,"On the best of the record, it's truly some of the most satisfying work he's ever done. Tracks 1-6 are absolutely stunning. The rest.....well, complete toss-aways. 'The Pretty Things Are Going To Hell', particularly bad, sounds like a Tin Machine re-tread. Thanks to Dave for grouping the record as he did. Listen and relisten to the first half of the cd and pretend the later four cuts didn't happen."
5,Bowie is Back on Top!,"Tremendous album from David Bowie. In all honesty, the album I've been waiting for since Scary Monsters and Super Creeps. There is not a weak link on it. Standouts include: Thursday's Child, Something in the Air, What's really Happening?, Seven, and If I'm Dreaming My Life. His singing and lyrics are great, and Reeves Gabrels guitar work is superb. A definite must have for all Bowie fans, and rock fans in general."
1,What ECD?,It is a sad day for music lovers when you get an ad for an ISP each and every time you insert the disk into your computer. Is this supposed to be value added content? Not very suave if you ask me.Music 4 + Advertisements -3 = 1
2,Very mediocre,"There's a couple of good track on Hours (Thursday's child, Something in the air and Seven) but overall it lacks quality songs. The instrumentation is a bit too passive and sparse too for my taste. In theory that could've worked well, since the lyrics are quite depressive and the overall mood is a heavy one, but it all sounds bit uninspired to me. Add to that the lack of inventive songwriting and you have a very mediocre album."
1,This is music that doesn't matter!,"Strained and boring, this is Bowie without a clue. No follow up to his proposed trilogy, only two tedious albums of nothing to speak of bring us to ""Hours"". A man that was once a role model is now a complacent bore. Too bad."
3,Mid-Tempo & Straight Forward,"This is a newly remastered version of a 1999 release with five bonus tracks, mostly b-sides and demos. Unlike most of Bowie's recent releases, this is mostly mid-tempo and pretty straight forward. There are 4 very strong songs (Thursday's Child, Something in the Air, Seven, The Pretty Things are Going to Hell) and the rest is sort of average. Worth buying if you can find it for a good price."
1,Very Poor,"I've been a fan for 25 years. I had a ticket to his Roseland cocnert, but I wasn't motivated to make the 5 hour trip. Today I listened again to Outside. Bowie, when he's good is so very good! When he's mundane, as on Hours, its passe to the max."
3,It'll grow on you,"Having highly enjoyed the energy of Outside and Earthling, I was initially disappointed in this understated collection. These songs have, however, endeared themselves to me over time.This is Bowie (or at least the narrators of the songs) being introspective and reflective. As a result, the music is ponderous, intentional, and cryptic.Be patient with this record. It'll be worth your time."
4,Great for beginners - Amazing for fans.,"I would be what you could call a David Bowie bystander. I was aware of him throughout my childhood and enjoyed the songs on the radio. I knew all the classics by heart and loved hearing them on the radio. That all changed when my husband brough home Hours.Being avid gamers, he bought this album for the music found on the game The Nomad Soul. As soon as we put it in, it was more than we expected. I have fallen in love with this album completely. It comforts, it cheers you up, it proves the wonder of love, and it cures insomnia! There's nothing better than to put this album on in the middle of a stormy night and lay in bed and listen to it."
4,Grows on you by the Hour,"At first listen I was disappointed. It seemed flat and monotonous. No single track stands out as brilliant, the styling seems a bit derivative (I always think ""XTC"" when I hear New Angels of Promise), and the lyrics are repetitive song to song. But for whatever reason it has a refurbished Bowie hook that hooked me, an echo of the David Bowie I grew up with perhaps. As a whole the album works and works well. The liner note design is forced, commercial, and annoying. But don't judge the album by its cover. Buy and hold. And enjoy."
3,Good ... Not Great,"Although I've liked David Bowie for a long time - Ziggy Stardust and Hunky Dory are classics, Young Americans is underated, and Earthling was pretty damn good for this late in his career - I've always felt he was somewhat of a ""shallow"" artist compared to others from his generation; Lennon, Dylan, Van Morrison, Neil Young. So I have a hard time with all the talk of this being such a 'deep/soul searching' album. I don't really hear it, I just hear Bowie. But, he does sound really good.""Thursday's Child"" and ""Seven"" are some of the best songs he's done in a long time. The only problem is the album really drops off in quality after track 7 ""The Pretty Things Are Going To Hell"" - after that the album kind of goes to hell. Oh well, 7 out of 10 ain't too bad. There should be half-stars so I could make it 3 1/2."
3,David Bowie: Jack of all trades,"He has a long standing music career, His own internet service, and now an awesome video game. David Bowie stars in Omikron: The Nomad Soul. I know this is a review for the CD ""Hours"" but I can't talk about the CD without talking about the game. This is a great game with great music. All of which was done by Bowie. I have never listened to the ""Hours"" CD but I know that all the music from ""Omikron"" (excluding ambient music) made it on to ""Hands"". Needless to say I am buying it."
3,"David must sack Reeves, pronto!","I expected a lot more than I got. It is still good fun listening the first few times. After the 5th time I got really bored. I really think the album would have been a lot better if guitarist and co-writer Reeves Gabrels would have been sacked. I think he is the weak point in Bowie's normally creative composing. He is too much of an influence to Mr. Bowie. If you compare the guitarists Carlos Alomar (He worked with Bowie on several albums in the late seventies and the early eighties) and Gabrels you will understand what I'm talking about. The best way to discribe Reeves' guitarplay is that it's whining. It has no rythem like that of Carlos. Reeves really tries to give the impression that he can play like Hendrix. But he most certainly doesn't. If Bowie sacks Gabrels and takes on a new guitarist, the next album will be a lot better. Maybe some collaborations with some other artists will help him regain his creativity. Excluding the pathetic R&B artists of today."
2,Don't like what the Great Chameleon did this time,"I like _most_ of Bowie's stuff and generally like that he's willing to reinvent himself while most of his contempories are still singing the same stuff they did in the 70's, but I don't like his sound on this one. He's still a great musician and I don't think this is trite or anyting, I just plain don't like it. You might want to give it a listen cause I know it'll apeal to some ppl."
4,hous has played for hours on my system,"I'm not a Bowie fan. In fact the first CD I bought of his was Earthling and I had to throw it out, I hated it so much! I bought hours mainly becasue of the amazing 3D artwork and general amazing packaging. On first listen I wasn't much impressed with anything besides ""The Pretty Things Are Going To Hell"", which really rocks and gets you moving. But upon further listenings, I began to feel the vibe of this CD and really get into it. He uses a quiet, subdued almost un-pluged like quality on some songs then a much more electronic feeling on others. Overall the feelin is one of new and futuristic music. I was suprised by the emotion and range in his voice. This doesn't sound like the man on Earthling. For anyone interested in truly new music that seems to shun many preconceived notions pick up this disc! I don't think it's made a Bowie fan out of me, but I'm interested to see what he comes up with next. Until then hours will be played upteen hours on my CD player."
2,Forget it!,"As long as masterpieces like ""Low"" and ""Heroes"" are available, there's absolutely no reason for buying this plastic and commercial album. Many songs are just empty, flat-sounding pop fluff. After his more experimental mid-'90s work, this is a sort of sellout and probably a blatant stab at the record charts all around the world. Many people claim this to be ""fabulous art"" because it's Bowie. O.k., it's Bowie, but this album is among his weakest."
4,"Bowie returns, finally!","Finally, David Bowie has returned to producing the type of music that earned him his fame during the 1970s. For much of the last two decades, his works have ranged from subpar to unlistenable. If you are a true Bowie fan and have hesitated to purchase this latest release, relax and make the investment and then enjoy. It's no Ziggy Stardust but still darn good."
2,Another superficial album. What are you doing Bowie???,"I respect Bowie since a long time. However, I must admit that this album, like many others from him, is inegal. It sounds like some of his 70s and 80s stuff. It could have been a genius idea to go without the techno-style this time. However, Bowie delivers poor songs on Hours..., too long and superficials. I still like his sense of soft tragedy and urgence on some songs, but this is not enough to make a great album. Bowie, if you read this, ""Please stop to always follow the music culture year after year. Yes, great bands are delivering cool hits on the radio, with inovative sounds, but you should deliver your own tragedy with your trips, not with music producers, mixers and fashion musicians. You're not Madonna. You're Bowie!... more than an interpret... a man with something to say about our little life."""
2,David Bowie is still hot but this effort is definitely cool!,Still love Bowie but with this CD he seems stuck in the '80s without the flash. Too moody.
1,It's a bad as most people say it is,"Simply put, this album is really bad. Bowie should be embarrased at releasing such a piece of trash. There might be 2 OK tracks, but that's it. The lyrics are depressing, the music is boring, and Bowie's voice sounds as if it's been electronically slowed down and drawn out. This will be the second Bowie album I trade-in as used. And it will be the last Bowie album I buy without first paying more attention to the critics and others."
3,HUH? (I don't get it...),"I'm having an exteremly difficult time getting into this release, even OUT of context with Bowie's past. Where did this stuff come from, in light of the artistically challenging ""OUTSIDE""?Is this all packaging sans content? Some of the sonics are crisp and delightfully satisfying, but I have to agree with Paul Hodson's review; ""Hmmm..."""
4,I never lost faith.,"""Hours..."" is the album David Bowie fans have been waiting for. Each song takes you on a new journey moving your mood in circles. This is the lush, melodic and yet experimental sound that Bowie fans yearn for. At times urgent- at times soft and enveloping. If you like Bowie from Hunky Dory to Scary Monsters you won't be disappointed. It's taken some time but I never lost faith."
5,Still Great,"While many other aging artists are living in the past, and just re singing the same old songs, Bowie is changing himself once again. Hours was his most mature and focused work in quite some time (though outside was brilliant). This album is a very dark, low album, but this time Bowie's being honest and more straightfoward. He's had a fantastic career, infact in the seventies he released 12 of history's greatest albums. I hope that he continues to release strong, great releases like this for many years."
4,If I'm dreaming all my life....,"What a comeback! OK, I know that Bowie never really disappeared from the scene, but he's been foundering for some time. This will hopefully signal th end of that period, as it is a really good recording. I'm not sure how many people will find all the metaphors in here, perhaps there aren't even supposed to be so many, but I just kept finding them. Added, many of the lyrics just fit my life right now, and the questions I find myself asking more and more--ie; ""were we meant to last""? Were we? Whether we were or not, this CD should--at least, for a darned long time."
4,Hours,Bowie has finally found what he has been looking for for the past 15-20 years. Something that was lost and now has been found. I Love this album. his best since the late seventies. I eagerly await his next venture.
2,Muzak on Parade,"It was with much anticipation that I waited for this CD...the last big one for the millenium...unfortunatley I found very little to have been excited about. The music is bland, the lyrics are insincere romantic tragedy at it's worse...and of course this one might become popular in say, Europe...but then again, ""Let's Dance"" was an immensely popular album that shared in the lack of same substance ""Hours"" does. There are moments of brillaince throughout the CD, but they sound more like ""planned accidents"" than anything else. The final track, ""The Dreamers"" does leave one with hope though...hence, two stars. Save your money and start a savings account at bowiebanc.com...you'll probably get more of interest there."
2,"Please David, sing again!","I find this album very boring. All the songs are slow, and they all sound the same. To top it off, Bowie rarely SINGS on this album - he talks all the way through most of the songs. I'm a huge fan of most of Bowie's stuff from Space Oddity to Scary Monsters, but not a lot of the later stuff (except Tin Machine) and I group this album with all of the new music. Don't get me wrong, this album isn't a complete waste of time. But I only ever listen to it on a rainy day while I read a book, and Bowie is capable of song writing that refuses to regulated to the background. I wish he would release something more innovative and creative again."
3,A solid effort with some nice highlights,"Compare this album to legendary works like Diamond Dogs or Ziggy Stardust and you're bound to be disappointed. On the other hand, compare it to the stuff that other 50+ year olds are putting out, and you'll find that this stacks up well. Hours is to Bowie what Division Bell was to Pink Floyd, better than the Stones' Voodoo Lounge, but never up to what Mule Variations was for Tom Waits, though ""Seven"" is excellent."
2,Not nearly great enough to close the Millenium,"It's a fine album, just not for David Bowie. The man is a genius as his earliest efforts and his recent bold ""Outside"" prove, but this is not the CD of a genius. I'll say it: trite"
3,Intriguing?,"Bowie has always, for me, been the number one innovator. So this album, blending great beats, new age, rock, and some industrial music should be good. But there is something missing.Thursdays Child is a great opener. It reaks of awsomeness. Something in the air keeps things up, though not as good. It is still great. Survive is great too. If I'm Dreaming My Life slows things down. It is a filler track. So are the rest of the songs.After survive not much is that good. New Angels of Promise is okay and the first 2 and a half minutes of The Dreamers are classic but let's just say it's no Heathen (The Rays)."
3,Bowie ends the millenium with a good effort,"Though not as exciting and as listenable ""earthling"" and "" outside"" both outstanding efforts.. This CD is a good effort- but one would expect Bowie to end the 90's and the millenium with a BANG!!!! This effort sounds like an Homage to his 72-79 period.. The song writing here is amazing and Bowie's voice is strong..but not a great record.. Best Tracks.. Thursday's Child,What's Really Happening,The Pretty ThingsAre Going Hell, Seven..... This album should have been better, but a great one for Bowie fans who liked his 70's stuff"
2,Cocaine is the remedy,"Bowie will revive, providing he will use drugs again. I'm saying this because he is going for another all time low. (The first was in the 80's) Reason? A real bowie album 'grows' on you. The more you listen, the better it gets. But here it is the other way round. At first the album seemed reasonably nice, but after the fifth time I couldn't bare it anymore. By the way the new videoclips are extremely boring and the guitarist Reeves Gabrels must be sacked."
2,"""Hours..."":Retrogress or Regress?","David Bowie, the curious man, the innovator of popular musics, the space-alien dilettante, the laurels-resting-upon richest musician in the U.K.: on ""Hours..."" the latter incarnation of Bowie makes his appearance, and I can say that I am little impressed with his flagrant complacency. Honestly, I opine that this outing was hardly much more than a soft-sell commercial for his new internet service ~ which is quite adamantly advertised on this enhanced cd's multimedia portion. I am not counting him out, yet, but Mr. Hunky Dory is in his mid-50's, and, like most pop/rock auteurs his age, he is beginning to age with a stagnant grace. And he had us so pumped up and throbbingly teased with Earthling...Can you hear me Major Tom? Have you turned in your tin can for a secret garden?"
1,truly horrible,"This was a terrible disappiontment. I would have been satisfied with one song as half as good as ""Miracle Goodnight"", but every song sounds like the vacant pop garbage that he played on Saturday Night Live."
1,Not compatible with mac,"Seems like a good product, but its not compatible with my mac, mac has an ap for your ipod touch to turn it into a ten key and it works great. This company is however great! I called to ask for assistance, they said it wasn't compatible and immediately refunded me (without even making me send the product back!)."
5,A highly stimulating educational resource,"Peter Ackroyd's The Beginning is an informed and informative nonfiction resource for young adults which superbly organizes and presents our latest scientific understanding of how the Earth was formed, how life evolved, and showcasing an era when humans were at the mercy of the elements and their environment. Brilliant color illustrations and what the latest discoveries in astronomy and paleontology have taught us about the Earth's history fill the pages of this exciting and highly stimulating educational resource. Very highly recommended for school and community library collections, The Beginning is the first title in Peter Ackroyd's new and forthcoming ""Voyages Through Time"" series from DK Publishing."
4,This is a strategy book and well done.,"M&A books tend to be written in one of either two ways - ""How-to"" and strategy. This is a business strategy book. It deals primarily with the post acquisition phase and the successful integration of the business into an overall business plan. It could be used as a textbook on the subject given it's rigor. An added bonus is that it is well written by two authors that know the subject"
3,Locking gas cap,I am using the gas cap and it is working ok. HOwever it is really hard to get on and off the vehicle at times. I don't think the fact that it is locking has any thing to with that fact. I bought a new cap because that was the problem with cap that was on the explorer before. I think it is a problem with the Explorer itself rather than the cap. I would probably buy it again.
2,The Falcon guide rip-off,"Dave Hall wrote one hiking book about Utah. However, it is sold under two different titles. One is ""The Hiker's Guide to Utah"" and the other is ""Hiking Utah"". They are both published by Falcon, with the same copyright date, and are completely the same book! I cannot in good conscience buy any other Falcon book, when it is obvious that Dave Hall and Falcon are purposefully trying to rip off the hiking public."
1,Never more,"My pants of this brand i hv bought a year ago shredded unfeasible sewing, the solution would be mailto analysis the fabric have told me, but the post costs is almost the price of the pants,unfortunatly i didn't buy in Amazon, perhaps i could have more support as i have had with my previous purchases."
2,DON'T USE ON 360 120GB HARD DRIVES!,"Let me start by saying I got the transfer kit to work right away on my old 20gb drive and was able to save a backup image to my PC. Then I tried to restore that backup image to my new 120gb hard drive but I wasn't able to get the PC to recognize that I had plugged in the hd. I disconnected the 120 and put it back on the xbox and then booted it up and was greeted with an E-68 error code, hardware failure, sweeeet. I put the 20gb drive on the xbox and it booted up right away. I don't know what the difference is from the 20gb to 120gb hard drive but something in this transfer kit burns out the 120, I followed all the directions step by step on both drives. I saw no warnings in the item description listed here, in the box it came in, or on Talismoon's website that this transfer kit was not compatible with the 120gb drives, be warned."
1,waist of money,it only works on old windows programs whitch i dont know anyone that still has it so there for it was a waste of my tome and money
3,"Just Don't Call Him The ""Invisible"" Man...","Joey Faust (Douglas Kennedy) is busted out of prison by a crazy major named Kenner. Faust is a safe-cracker and Kenner wants to use radiation to turn him invisible.... er, transparent (imagine the possibilities). The major also has plans to create an army of invisible.... I mean transparent soldiers (!) for supposed world domination. With the help of Faust and Dr. Uloff (a German refugee who killed his own wife during concentration camp experiments), Kenner hopes to steal vital fissile material in order to finalize his evil plot. I love mad-science! I drool over radioactive experiments gone wrong! I also like the idea of being invisible (ok, transparent)! I didn't even mention Marguerite ""Flight To Mars"" Chapman messing with her nylons! Rrrrrrowrrr..."
1,Would have been fun if I could have actually watched the movie.,Well the DVD arrived and I jumped to my DVD player in the lounge to watch this. Oh boy.The player grrred and moaned and then spat the disk out saying there was a read error. Tried it in my portable player and that did not like this. I then placed it into the laptop and desktop PC drives and got more or less the same result.This disk just did not want to play. More of the fact it looked like a burnt DVD that you make yourself at home. Sorry I have to give this only 1 / 5 fo the fact you can't even play the content on the disk.
2,I'm scared... not!,"This movie is laughably bad. It's so old, and the picture quality is so unbelievably awful, it's not a scary movie by any stretch of the imagination. It's only scary feature is the fact that it is remembered enough to be released on DVD. My favorite part was the mouse trapped to a machine and then it disappears. It disappears in such a cheesy, horrible way because the film tricks used back in the early 60's were so weak, so it doesn't look believable. Another favorite part was the guy who was supposedly being beat up by an invisible man, but it was really funny because the guy was jumping around pretending he was getting punched and strangled. It's funny! Before anyone accuses me of not being able to appreciate old horror movies, just let me tell you that I've seen other films released from around this time, and they looked a LOT better, and the acting and scary moments were a lot better as well. This is just not a good movie."
4,As genuine and down-to-earth as Denny himself ...,I had the pleasure to spend an evening with Denny at my wife's class reunion. His music is as genuine and down-to-earth as he is. Each successive album is another plateau in a brilliant career. I have become a huge fan of his music.
4,Leslie's distinctive riffing is almost enough,"This is a great sounding album. Leslie is playing and singing as well as one could expect. The songs suit his style. And if it all comes off sounding more than a little like ZZ Top, that's okay. The problem is that when you put the name of Mountain on an album, people will expect a certain sound. Leslie does what he can with Nantucket Sleighride but the missing pieces just become all the more glaring when you redo a song like that one.The loss of Felix Pappalardi was huge. His singing and songwriting were just as important as Leslie's. But the missing piece that Leslie refuses to acknowledge is the importance to the Mountain sound of Steve Knight's keyboards. Mountain was more than a blues band, but without a great keyboard player they have no choice but to play the blues."
4,these boys still rock,"This along with man's world have some kick a-- songs on it. The dvd sea of fire is awesome. And ive seen these guys live about 5 times in the last 3 or 4 years they still kick a-- and are much more entertaining with corky firing drum sticks at leslie, and leslie knockin over corky's cymbals then most of todays LAME music bein drilled into your head by the media and mtv/vh1."
2,Not their best,"Nothing special here and if you are looking for an introduction into Mountain, this shouldn't be it.If you play ""Talk Dirty"" from Leslie's late 80s album and the song ""Mystic Fire"", guess what? It's the same riff. A good riff mind you - but I hope he doesn't use it again ten years from now and name it something else.Get Nantucket, Climbing, The Road, Mountain etc. before you consider getting this."
3,Mixed Feelings,"Interesting CD. Sometimes, Mountain sounds like a combination of Rob Zombie and ZZ Top and sometimes there's almost a hint of Jim Morrison and the Doors (on Mystic Fire for instance). This is one CD I really can't totally recommend, but can't really say it's all bad either. ""Mystic Fire"", ""The Sea"", and especially ""Better Off With The Blues"" are pretty good tunes.""Fever"", the old cover done by who knows how many ""lounge singers"" and jazzed up here just doesn't seem to belong. I would have preferred another original track from the band. I like the three songs previously mentioned, but otherwise, I'd probably leave this one alone."
4,Minimilism at its best,"This cd was the first cd to introduce me to Reich's compositional style. Little did I know how minimalism could be so exciting. The Music for a Large Ensemble uses a great pallete of tone color to pull the listener in. The Violin Phase is one of my favorites. The different harmonic and melodic patterns that are created through the phasing of the instruments is amazing. The only reason I give it four starts is because the versions of the recordings are somewhat short. To really get a feel for the music and to better experience what Reich is trying to do, I would suggest listening to longer recordings. Music for a Large Ensemble is available in much longer versions. Octet and Violin Phase are much harder to find, so I would definitely recommend this cd for those works."
1,Don't buy this if you want it for your Kindle.,I purchased this Nursing2008 under a search I had done on Amazon for subscriptions for my Kindle. After I purchased it and realized I could not read it on my Kindle. I clicked to cancel the order (the magazine was not going to be mailed for like a month) and they are telling me they can't cancel it but I can send it back when I get it. What the #!#* is this????? Be careful about what you buy on Amazon.
5,"Great Magazine, Great Service","The reviews on not receiving all issues seem out of date. I subscribed to Nursing2010 mid-year and not only did they send me the previous issues I did not need to pay for but my subscription continued for a full year. Maybe the difference is that I ordered from the LWW website. If you have a code from one of their magazine inserts you get a great discount. It has been a fantastic resource for me as a new nurse with interesting, up-to-date articles. I find them very relevant to most nursing areas. I have loved reading them!"
1,Order from Amazon,Make sure you order this magazine from Amazon(.com). I ordered from the publisher and have had nothing but problems. It's been a month since I ordered it and still no magazine. I have e-mailed them several times but have not gotten the answers I asked for or found out where my subscription is. As a result I would recommend going with a magazine from another publisher.
1,I have not received the magazine yet and am wondering when it will come.,I am a little upset that I have not recieved the first issue of the magazune
4,Good value air filter for 1st gen Suzuki SV650 ('99 - '02),"This K&N; air filter is a good value, and fits the 1st generation Suzuki SV650 ('99 - '02). I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because it does not come pre-oiled, so you'll have to buy a separate bottle of oil (I recommend the K&N; 99-5050 Filter Care Service Kit - Squeeze, available on Amazon).Otherwise a good fit and does the job. Recommended."
5,I always trust K&N for their superb quality!!!!,"I recently purchased this air filter for my 2002 Shadow ACE 750 and instantly noticed a difference. The bike responds a lot faster and the increased air flow alows the bike to feel less ""forced"". I install K&N products in all my vehicles. There is a notable difference without having to remove stock air box."
5,good breather,"its a different shape than the stock filter for my 82' xv750 but the holes line up fine and it fits well in my airbox,i definitely notice the increased performance from better airflow, and its reusable"
5,A great filter that gave me extra power,"I bought this for my Suzuki Boulevard C50 because I wanted a washable filter that lasted a long time. I heard people talking about how a K&N filter gave them extra power. I didn't really believe all that, but after I installed this filter on my bike, there was a small yet noticeable increase in power. I am happy! Extra performance on a washable filter that will last me for the life of the bike."
5,Good Product! Fast Service from vendor!,"I have always been a fan of K&N products. In this case it was a matter of getting a good deal, this vedor was very fast and had a great price!"
5,Excellent Choice,"K&N has long been a favorite of mine, when it came time to change the air filter on my motorcycle, the choice was simple. The product took about 2 minutes to install and while I can't substantiate the HP or fuel mileage increase, I can tell you the acceleration right off the bottom is noticeable immediately. If you switch your filter, this ""lifetime"" replacement is a ""must have""!"
4,v star 650 air filter,"Fitment is good, would be excellent if it had a tab for the stock clip to hold it in place. I bent the tab to help hold it while putting the cover on.Have used K&N; filters in all my bikes they work well and are easy to clean and oil."
5,GOOD BUY FOR THE MONEY,Very happy w/the product and the shipping service. This filter sells for more at most other sights. Would reccommend this to people I know.
5,Great working Air filter,"I don't have much experience riding my Suzuki Savage with the stock air filter, and the one it had when I got the bike was in really bad shape. I at least know that this one is a huge improvement."
3,K&N Filter,Filter was shipped quickly; easy to install; bike stored for winter @ the moment; not the best review @ this time
3,"Nice product, but wish it came pre-oiled","Bought this for a 1982 Yamaha 650 Seca. Fits properly, but wish it came pre-oiled like other K&N filters. The informational sheet says to use 3/4 of the oil packet, but following K&N's directions to oil every crease, I easily used the entire tube."
3,NO OIL,Good filter but it does not come pre-oiled like they do on other sites! Had to order the oil separately which was another $18 if i recall
1,K&N Air filter,K&N makes great air filters. This post is more about amazon. Make sure you double check your motorcycles correct fit on K&N web site. Amazon lets products in the search criteria that are wrong even if you type in everything specific to your bike.
1,Unreasonable wait!,I have been waiting for this product well beyond any reasonable timeframe. I could have bought it and paid just a little more and had it in 3 days. Amazon must be sourcing this item from the Amazon rainforest by mule train. They are unresponsive to previous inquiry. I will cancel soon.
5,K&N All the way,I recently replaced my stock air filter out of my gsxr-750 and this air filter DEFINITELY is worth the money. It is reuseable and washable which is the best part. I recommend buying a cleaner for it if you are going to indeed clean it.
4,K&N air filter,"Good fit, really did not notice any increase of power. The filter on a conours 14 '08 is on the left side. Remove left plastic and electronic relay bracket, lift rubber flap on frame just below the fuel tank and there it is. good luck!"
5,Mixture problem,"Bike runs normal before was too rich, even the choke works wheer before the chock would kill the bikei have better millage as well"
4,Good filter.,Excellent filter. The installation instructions could have been a little clearer. Would definitely recommend for anyone looking to replace their original filter.
3,same as any K&N,"maybe a little increase in horse power, most of it is probably mental anyway now with all the electronic sensors on a vehicle."
5,K&N Filter for GSX-R750,This filter fit my stock air box fine. I do not know about any real horsepower gains. It will be interesting to dyno the bike to see if it made any measurable improvement.
2,K&N Kawasaki Air Cleaner,"High quality filter, very tight fit and near impossible to remove without damaging it. No doubt it works but very hard to get out of try."
4,a little difficult to install...,"Great system, I have K&N in all of my vehicles but it is a pain to install on the klr 650. it's difficult to get the screw to line up in the little space that you have but still delivers the quality that i expected. better throttle response and a slight power increase."
4,Really great product,we ordered this abut a week ago arrived precisely when they said it would but not without its issues we did have some problems with shipping but with working with amazon it was quickly resolvedBut onto the good part after receiving the filters of course my husband wanted to put them on immediately in taking the bike apart you have to know what you are doing its a little hard to get to the filters a little work is involved but anything worth doing is worth doing right once the filtrers were in (by the way the instructions are very easy to see and read pictures are great)the bike instantly ran better the performance was signifacant i really love this product would recommend to anyone
5,zzr1200 k&n air filter,"exactly what i asked for, good timing also, had absolutely no problems at all, will deal again when looking for more stuff"
4,Air Filter,This replacement air filter is a less expensive alternative to the factory filters but it does not easily fit; it can be made to fit but does take some doing.
2,Didn't fit properly.,"I purchased the K&N HA-6003 as a replacement for the stock filter in my 2003 Honda CBR600RR. The fit of the K&N was poor at best. I did manage to get it in, but not without considerable effort. Now that it's in the bike, I am a bit worried about it sealing properly. If I had it to do again, I would go with a different hi-flo aftermarket filter, or the OEM."
2,Both Stars are for D'Onofrio,"I too bought this on VHS for Vincent D'Onofrio. My only negative comment about his performance is that there's not enough of it! I'll say right here and now that I'm not a big fan of Smits or Scacchi, and D'Onofrio overpowers them every time he's on screen. It's a beautiful story, and I can see why director Gillian Armstrong was attracted to it - it is a love story with a bit of real-life depth (rather than those soapy ones where the ridiculous problems are created by the characters for lack of imagination - Julia Roberts films, anyone?). That being said, the two lead roles needed to be played by stronger actors, and ones that could keep up with D'Onofrio vivacity. Worth a look for fans."
5,Just Great!,"Absolutely Perfect, I was concern about the X-Acto brand. But it is absolutely GOOD. I'm a elementary teacher and it had woks perfect for my class."
4,Nice sharpener,"So far so good. Sharpens fast and even. Seems extremely heavy duty. But if you use it a lot, empty often. When it gets full, it's a little tricky pulling the shavings tray out because the pile mounds up unevenly and acts as a wedge. Once you get it dislodged, there are many crevices inside that collect shavings. You need to do a lot of shaking and a little digging in several places to get the inside totally shavings free. I really like the sharpener; I just need to empty it more often."
5,Heavy duty pencil sharpener,"So far this has been an awesome pencil sharpner. I received it quickly. Most important it is durable, when I first received it all my kids were excited to use it. And of course one of them put the eraser end in first...but I was able to pull out the metal piece and it works just fine. Worth the money, wish I would have bought this before I bought the others."
1,Broke after one week.,"I purchased this electric sharpener for use in my fourth grade classroom of 34 kids. Cheap plastic shavings holder broke after 5 days, and the machine stopped working entirely right after that. Pencils only were used, and it was not heavy usage. I am totally disappointed in how much money I spent for this!"
1,Wouldn't work,"The sharpener sat around for a month or so before I used it. When I went to use it, it didn't even have sufficient power to sharpen a pencil. Amazon wouldn't accept a return because I was out of the warranty period."
1,Lasted a few months,"The plastic inside broke, for some reason. For its price, I was surprised at how shotty the workmanship was. Will not buy this brand again. Total disappointment."
1,waited long time just to be disappointed,"I purchased this item July 18th and finally got it today. When I put in a pencil nothing happened, I tried 2 other outlets which were both working and nothing. I should have listened to the other reviews and stayed away from what they called junk.X-Acto 1744 Heavy-Duty Electric Pencil Sharpener, Black, 1 Unitupdate nov. 15th 2012 had replacement sharpener for months now works fine."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!,"Not only did it just last a month, but Amazon gave me a hard timeabout returning it since it worked when I first receieved it.In all the years that I have ordered from Amazon, and thousands ofdollars that I have spent there, I have been fortunate to nothave to return anything. After this experience, I now know betterthan to ever order electronics from them. It's much better tobuy from a store that will take it back if it stops working aftermerely a month. The agents at the third world country that Amazonhas outsourced customer service to obviously thought that 46 dollarsfor an electric pencil sharpener that worked for a month was notunacceptable. After years of enjoying the convenience of orderingfrom Amazon, I will think twice about ordering ANYTHING from them again."
2,X-Acto,We use these at our school... it will last at least 6 months... maybe a year... but never more...
2,Don't put on a wood surface!,"For a pencil sharpener, I would give it five stars as it sharpens about as well as any I've tried. However, I placed it on a wood table, and noticed yesterday there are black rings from the rubber feet which have stained the wood and would not come up no matter what I tried. I am very upset as this was nice wood. So if you buy it, place something under it before putting on a wood desk!!!"
1,Weak,"I've just returned this machine after less than one day of use. Apparently it is not designed to sharpen the sorts of pencils used in art, which often have softer leads. It appears that lead gets jammed in the back of the sharpening mechanism with no way to remove it, rendering the machine useless. I'll be shopping for another model."
3,Slightly disapppointed,"We bought this for home use. We may have been a little excited to use it, but found that it overheated after about 15 pencils. Therefore, it's not very heavy-duty. Other than that, though, if you only need it for light jobs here and there, it should serve its purpose. If I had a choice, however, I would have bought another model."
1,Yuck,Weak motor. Barely push in the pencil and it stalls. Pencil is sharpened *very* crooked and eats half of it. Sending it back!
3,Over sharpens the Pencil,"I looked and looked for a good electric pencil sharpener, but this one just didn't do the job. It eats about 1/3 of the pencil before it sharpens and then the lead is loose. I read the one November review when I purchased the sharpener, but perhaps the one I received wasn't good. I have kept this too long to return it so will have to keep it now."
2,Nice unit - when it's not overheated,"We bought the heavy-duty X-Acto electrical AND a heavy-duty X-Acto mechanical pencil sharpener recently. The electrical one got over-heated after about sharpening 20 new pencils. The mechanical one had no problem. If you don't mind it shutting down for about 30 minutes with each heavy and continuous use, or its big and bulky footprint, get the electrical one. I personally would not recommend this model to anyone."
1,Didn't last long,Unit was purchased to use in middle school classroom. It lasted one month. I checked the switch and that was alright so I'm assuming either the overload or motor failed.
5,So far so good,This baby has lasted 6 months so far with continued usage. Much better than ones previously purchased at Staples. Was looking for one to match an old Panasonic but this has a lot of power.
2,Great pencil sharpener with a short life span,t had a good life but a short life. The sharpener Lasted 2 mnonths in my classroom. It's not student proof.
3,Broke after one month of classroom use,"We gave this pencil sharpener to a 2nd-grade teacher. While it worked, it worked great. But it broke after one month of classroom use. In your home, it would probably last longer. We still haven't found a good solution for the classroom."
1,Poor quality and inferior workmanship!,"I purchased this pencil sharpener for my classroom, and have had problems with it from the first day. When you try to empty it, the back wall of the compartment falls off and is always a problem to put back together. It's also difficult to tell when it is full. Most of the electric pencil sharpeners I've gotten over the years at this price have lasted at least two years, and this one is now shot after only 5 months. I will never get this type again!"
1,Poor quality control,"The first X-Acto pencil sharpener I purchased from Amazon was ""dead"" within 3 months of once-a-week use, sharpening about 25 pencils, 10 pencils at a time. The motor was dead. Sent it back to Amazon for replacement; no problem with being replaced. The replacement was defective on arrival (it had a loud metal-on-metal screech on the first use). It would still sharpen, despite the screech, and within a day the screech stopped. Now, six weeks later, it has bitten the dust. Can't send it back to Amazon for a replacement, according to their return policies, so I have to deal with the manufacturer. It does sharpen well when working, so I thought I would try one more time. This pencil sharpener has a two-year warranty."
3,Empty regularly or else...,"This was a good unit, except for one important problem... when the drawer that collects debris is full, from the front, the unit still looks half-empty due to the design of the drawer unit. This is a very bad design flaw since once the drawer is full, the blades begin to choke up and jam. The motor then burns out, and you need to get a new sharpener.The other negative about this sharpener is that it only takes the standard pencil. Forget about slightly oversized or oddly shaped pencils such as the triangular cross-sectioned pencils that one might use with children to encourage proper finger positioning."
2,Noisey after 14 months but still works.,"It arrived yesterday and so far I love it. To those stating they sharpen 20-30 pencils at a time I'd say, ease off and slow down. Give it a rest. And the included slip clearly states not for use in sharpening waxy type soft art pencils. The catch tray for the shavings is not huge, so remember to empty it regularly. I do laugh ... they call this Heavy Duty. My old Boston sharpener was also 2.0amps, same as this one, was 1/2 the size, and not labeled heavy duty. Prices have gone up. This one is twice what I paid for the old one, but it's 15 years later, after all. This appears to be high quality and should last for a few years. UPDATE 3/2012: Here it is a year later. It still works fine, but very noisey. Did try some machine oil on the gears but noise continues. I expected it to last longer than this, more quietly. ADDITIONAL UPDATE 6/2012: The noise continues and is getting worse. I would not buy this brand again."
2,Not so heavy duty,I purchased this pencil sharpener July of 2010 ready to start the 2010-2011 school year. It lasted the whole 10 months. I unpacked it for the next school year and only made it half way through. My 17 students only sharpen 2 pencils a day if needed so it is only operated for 10 min each morning. I expected it to last longer being it was a heavy duty sharpener.
1,D.O.A.,"X-Acto heavy duty is dead on arrival. It could not sharpen a single pencil, just made humming noise. Will have to send it back. Like I have nothing else to do. I am out of luck with pencil sharpeners. The iPoint one I bought before at Costco never worked well and would always get stuck so I had to return it. People, recommend something decent, please!"
2,Quality control is an issue,"The first one of these sharpeners that I bought worked wonderfully. The only complaint I could make about it was that the shavings tray is very small, and if it got overfilled it was very difficult to pull out and could break.But when it came time to replace it, my second one's blades were clearly off center, because no pencil would sharpen evenly. The whole unit would shake and rattle too. So I returned it. The third one also had a similar off-center problem, and to make matters worse, as soon as I inserted a pencil it would never shut off again until I unplugged it.After that, I gave up and went with another brand."
1,Breaks pencils but doesn't sharpen,"I am a teacher and have used this sharpener for over a year. It tries to sharpen the pencils but frequently breaks the tip off in the process. My students and I have frequently started with a new pencil and ended up with nothing more than a blunt, unusable nub. Very noisy and has stopped working at different times. I took it apart and repaired it but it never worked properly. Stay away from this one."
2,Disappointing,"Very disappointing. Mediocre performances, and most of the songs have nothing to do with New York."
3,an ok iron supplement,"I've been anemic for years, found my usual iron supplement unavailable and bought this instead. It was ok but took 2 or 3 tabs to make up for one of the other whole food iron tabs I took before."
4,Gentle Vitamin with an Unpleasant Taste,"I've been taking the Megafood Women's supplement for several months now and have been pleased. I never took a vitamin until I was an adult and had a very unpleasant experience with a mega-store brand (I had no idea that nausea was a side effect of vitamins at that point). After doing a great deal of research, I decided on these. Their claims are perfectly true. I have never had a single bad side effect from these, and I've taken them at different times during the day. Although it's hard to judge whether vitamins are ""working,"" I do feel that they're having a good result.My one major complaint is that these vitamins taste bad. If you don't get them down very quickly, they'll leave a pretty rough flavor behind, and, even if you do swallow them instantly, they still put a bad taste on your tongue. I will say, however, that the flavor is not long-lasting. With some bad-tasting supplements, you hear about people ""burping them"" for hours. That's not the case here."
4,A note to readers,"I'm in progress of reading this book, and I am finding it rather intrigueing. I would like to mention to those of you who have strongly opposed this book in reviews, that statisticsts are merely trends observed in nature and not facts. That said, it would be interesting to know the birth order of those who oppose and those who agree with Dr. Sulloway's observations. I'm willing to bet that the results of that survey would support his findings. By the way... I'm the youngest of 4."
2,a landmark work?,"The only thing lankmark about Sulloway's second big book is that it's been labeled ""landmark"" by everybody, and possibly by the author himself, behind his false modesty and intellectual cowardice. It is not surprising that all the big names are praising this book; and as one of the customer reviews said: Sulloway is shooting some Marxist and Freudian cows. In his dreams, maybe. I only wish Sulloway would learn to do some honest history one day, instead of piling documents upon documents, and ""evidence"" upon ""evidence"" and call that science. Well, science this is not. Unfortunately, the topic is too complex for even 200 pages of notes. In reading this book one ought to think about what Sulloway ignores and waves away... If one has nothing better to do with his time, one could conceivably write a book to prove that Americans only drink beer"
3,"Panaramic view of the ""postmodern/mortem 90's"" lacks clarity","The movement from the local, specific datum of everday day human actions to the generalizations of a ""scientific"" theory of human behaviour may provide for interesting conversation at the dinner table, unfortunately the ""structures"" apparent in the patterns of human action do not conform neatly to ""laws"" as do the physical phenomena of the universe...and hopefully never will. I am the third of three by the way"
1,This book illustrates to me what is wrong with psychology today,"This book is illustrative to me of what is wrong with psychology today. As was brilliantly pointed out in Judith Harris's book ""No Two Alike,"" this book has no scientific basis. I am at least the second review here to point this out.As Harris explains, the portion of the variance for most major traits(juvenile delinquency being a rare exception) that can be attributed to birth order is basically negligible. The only reason for why a correlation may exist at all is probably due to genetic differences in the parents themselves. For example, parents with higher IQs tend to have fewer children. Since IQ is a heritable trait, we can expect only children to have higher IQs than latter-born children in large families. The cause here is genetic in origin. Once these genetic effects have been corrected for, the role of birth order becomes negligible."
1,Already forgotten,"This book was selected by NY Times as a notable book of the year. The NY Times, indeed, knew what's up. More than any other, Born to Rebel belonged to the year in which it was published; it didn't take long at all for it to be forgotten--as soon as the next year arrived it became a historical document. A classic? Stunning? Masterful? Why is its reputation in rapid decline? Sulloway writes books which don't even pass the 2-year test. Surely this is a perfect example of how vulnerable ""contemporary"" reputation is."
2,stupid,"This book seems to me to be exceptionally stupid, but unfortunately very characteristic of all the ""exceptional"" (that is, critically acclaimed) books nowadays"
3,"Innovation, Innovators and Acceptors rather","I think the book is misrepresented by it's own title. It's not really a collection of knowledge on birth order and the psychological ramifications of birth order. Instead, the book is about applying what is known about birth order to see if there is a correlation between historical figures' birth order and family variables, and their degree of revolutionary innovation, or acceptance of revolutionary innovation.Most of the historically significant scientists are covered, such as Galileo, Copernicus, and Darwin (especially Darwin, there's whole chapters on Darwin). There's a lot of biographical information in the book in general."
5,best buy for price,"Good quality speakers and subwoofer for the price. I bought them to replace Creative's equivalent, and these are way better. I like the headphone jack and volume incorperated in the right speaker."
2,Hollow-sounding bass; other problems,"The bass sounds very hollow and boomy. The woofer is also too loud compared to the left and right speakers. Since there's no way to adjust the volume of the woofer separately, I ended up not being able to turn the speakers up as much as I wanted to -- the bass would overpower the rest of the sound when I did.The volume control is deceptive. When you turn the volume up 50%, you get about 90% of the maximum sound output. The remaining half of the volume control is pretty much useless.The cord connecting the left and right speakers is permanently attached to both of them, which can be annoying. It's about 6 feet long -- too short for my desk. The input cord and the cord to the woofer are also permanently attached to the right speaker."
5,Riding on 20's,"Strengths: Clear sound, sufficient bass, as loud as you would want for a medium sized room.Weaknesses: Wires are a bit short for me. They will grace around your monitor, but don't expect to spread them out more than 4 feet.Bought these speakers since some Altec Lansings I wanted for under $30 were sold out. I was skeptical of these. To my pleasant surprise these sound better than my Aiwa stereo I had plugged into my computer, granted it was an Aiwa. The sound is crisp, clear and the range is great. More than adequate for pumping out some huge sounds in a medium sized room. The bass is perfect and not over powering unlike some reviews on other sites have said. You can't control the bass externally, but just adjust the bass in the music player you use if you think it is too much (too much?)."
4,Good Speakers and Good Price,I bought these speakers as a birthday present for my husband because his old speakers were wearing out. I have been really pleased with them and surprised that though they are small they put out an excellent quality of sound. The subwoofer puts out a good amount of bass also. If you are looking for good speakers and a great price I suggest these ones.
3,Logitech R-20 2.1 Speaker System,Its at its best for the value given. Dont go for this if you need the one which can entertain you at your parties at home and really done go for this if you need the REAL ONE.
5,Can't Beat This Set For The $$$,"We purchased this set as a low-end option to replace the Dell set that my husband reclaimed to go with his new flat screen monitor. As is everyone, we are watching the pennies right now, and looked at this set as a compromise between price and quality. It was to accompany the CRT monitor that I inherited from him along with his old Dell computer. After we received it and have been using it for about two months, I am VERY happy to say that there is absolutely NO COMPROMISE when it comes to performance, quality of the sound and appearance. It matches my other Dell components perfectly and I am THRILLED with my system now. My husband is pleased that I do not hog HIS computer any more. Price was great, delivery was speedy and we are very pleased."
3,"No bass control, loud, but not great sound quality","I was surprised that all this speaker had was volume control. No bass control like the other 2.1 speakers. Apart from that, pretty good for the price."
4,2.1 PC speaker,works well with any player but you will need a female adaptor. Good product for its price.
4,Speaker Review,I think the speakers are good value for the price. The one flaw that I have found is the base volume over powers the rest of the music. If there was a way to control it I would have any complaints at all.
3,Good enough for price.,These speaker are ok for the money. It would be better if they had a bass control on the bass speaker. That is my only real complaint.
1,Bass is boomy and there is no way to adjust it,"The bass on these speakers is annoyingly boomy on many songs (bluegrass and other acoustic music, I'm not talking Hip-Hop here) and there is no way to adjust it b/c there is no bass or tone control. Changing the equalizer settings in Windows Media Player helps some but does not solve the problem, and I use many other kinds of audio programs, not all of which have equalizers to adjust. You can't use them w/out the subwoofer because it supplies power to the speakers."
5,Awesome,"I plugged the Logitech R-20 speakers into my laptop and played D4l-Laffy Taffy..I was astonished..!!! The sound is rich and loud, and the woofer provides amazing bass..Fantastic choice..!!!"
4,Neat Piece of speakers,Well i basically got this for home use and its doing fine..No doubt its good for its price...
4,Laptop Speakers,"Good speakers for the price. Can't bump your trunk on these 26Watt speakers. Have to plug in the woofer so it's not portable. Otherwise, it's a good buy."
4,Logitech R-20 Speakers,While these are no high end quality speakers. For the $20 price tag they were a huge upgrade from the speakers that I had originally.
2,No Options,"These speakers have no separate adjustment for subwoofer volume. You will have to use equalizer settings in whatever media program you are using if you want to tone down the subwoofer. Also, the speakers will not work without the subwoofer plugged in. So, this is not the product for you if you need to keep things quiet at times."
3,"Ok, cheap speakers",The sound quality isn't great while listening to music because you can't adjust the bass but its fine for watching movies
1,You get what you pay for,"They are nice looking speakers but they arent very loud. I didnt think that not having control over the subwoofer would be an issue but it is. I really dont like not being able to modulate the bass. Like I said, you get what you pay for. Im gonna put them in my office and be happy I didnt pay a lot for them."
2,Worst Bass I Have Ever Heard,"I got these very cheap with a coupon so they totalled below 3 dollars shipped. They are not really worth even that. In iTunes, I have set the bass on its absolute lowest settings and I can still barely hear non-bassy sound. The bass interference is so heavy that I cannot even hear the words to songs without modifying the equalizer heavily. I called the company about it and they said that it was typical for the model."
3,Good system,"Overall, I'm pleased with this product. However the bass from the subwoofer sounds a little distorted. I have to adjust my equalizer when I play music from iTunes so I don't get too much bass. For the money, it's a good speaker system."
3,50/50 Satisfaction,"With speakers, it appears to be true that you get what you pay for. For the price, the sound quality is decent. I would never find a better 3 piece system for the small amount I paid for these. Major negative: the bass is sometimes overpowering and there is no software/equalizer to adjust this unbalance. Only thing that helps, somewhat, is when playing music thru Media Player you must use the equalizer in there.Again, for the price the sound is not bad....but if you listen to music with a lot of bass, be ready to thump the house."
4,great price,This was a gift for a relative and he was very pleased with the set for his laptop. Great price and delivery.
1,headache after 5 minutes,"I just got these speakers, I was excited to try them out after all the good reviews. No matter what genre of music I listened to and how much I adjusted the equalizer in windows media player, the bass was just completely overwhelming everything else, had a distorted sound, and gave me a huge headache. The overall sound quality is poor, I will be sending these back tomorrow!"
3,Worth $20,"These are kind of muddy sounding, but for $20 what did you want. I got what I expected for $20. If you want high end sound, look elsewhere. If you need speakers and you are cheap, these are spot on. These look pretty good, have a power button right on the front (not soft touch, but a real power button, so no power draw when you are not using them) and a headphone jack. I got what I was looking for and nothing more."
4,Speaker Review,"AT first I wanted to return the speakers, because the bass sounded awful. After spending some time trouble shooting, I figured out how to adjust settings on media player speaker/base/equalizer options to make the speaker sound better. So now I am happy with them, for the price they are, I would recommend them."
3,Middle of the road,These speakers work fine. The weak point is that the cord to the subwoofer can easily work loose.
2,Inexpensive speakers - get what you pay for,"The speakers are relatively inexpensive. Accordingly the sound quality is also sub-optimal. The volume knob needs to be turned all the way ""up"" in order to hear anything audible.If I had to do this again, I would have spent a bit more to receive a decent set of speakers."
2,It pains me to say this,You get what you pay for. For best sound with iTunes I found that the 'Treble Booster' Equalizer setting is needed. Louder than my Thinkpad speakers but I'm afraid to compare the quality until this transaction is no longer visible on my online bank statement.
2,You get what you pay for,"I had a pair of JBL's that came with my compaq computer and wanted a little more base for my music. I thought these would be perfect and were a great price. Well right off the bat I have to go back to the previous posts that warned of a 'Hollow base' sound. It's not just hollow, it's vibrating and hollow. Not an attractive sound. The two side speakers did not have the rich sound as the JBL's. But at the end of the day I had more base less richness is sound and an irratating noise called a base speaker. You can cut the output from the computer down to about 70% and you have a decent set of speakers. Price is Equal to Value on this one. (((Lesson learned))) Spend the bucks to get a nice set of computer speakers. I thought I would go the cheap route and lost."
1,Wish I could retrun,"The speakers sounded great upon opening the box. Within a week, the sub wolfer quit working. Since I know longer have the original box, I can not return the item."
3,Disappointing revision of the book,"This should have been a wonderful movie--Angela Lansbury and most of the rest of the cast are terrific. But someone decided that the book was too sad as originally written. I don't want to give away the book's story for those who haven't read it yet, but two major deaths have been written out and family reconciliations abound. The novel was much tougher--and truer--as written by Ms. Pilcher. Totally unnecessary."
2,Turn it off before the last 20 minutes.,"This is one of my favorite books and after re-reading it for the umpteenth time I decided to purchase the Hallmark Hall of Fame version. The first part is very good for a TV movie - beautiful locations, fine acting (how can one fault Angela Lansbury?), and relatively faithful to the story (one must take into consideration that time is of the essence on TV and often plots become condensed). However, to TOTALLY change the ending (a medical mis-diagnosis unexplained and bringing characters back from the dead to name only two!) was unconscionable. The power of the story was lost and it turned into just another tear-jerker. It would be as if Scarlett and Rhett rode off into the sunset together and lived happily ever after! BUT, if you've never read the book it would be an enjoyable couple of hours entertainment. I will never watch The Shell Seekers again, and am putting mine up for sale (cheap!)."
1,Try again later . . .,"I saw about 20 minutes of the Hallmark TV version and went shrieking from the room! And this is possibly my favorite novel of all time. Angela Lansbury is terribly miscast. Penelope with stiffly coiffed hair, a corsage and a pink afternoon dress?!? What happened to the boat cloak? It should have been Judy Dench! This is nearly as bad as the carnage wreaked on ""Clan of the Cave Bear"" by casting Darryl Hannah. Trying to stuff a big novel into 98 minutes is a travesty. I see why writers like Steven King and J.K. Rowling take such tough control of their works when someone wants to film them. Couldn't we wait a few years and try again, this time in a 13 week series or something like ""Ballykissangel""?"
2,No way to improve upon the book,"I was disappointed to say the least. Ms. Lansbury was fine, but the other casting was not good enough. I realize that the detail of the book would be impossible to impart in such a short film, but the changes - huge changes - were too much. Richard being alive for one. In the book, they never would have chosen to be apart! I felt sad for anyone who viewed the movie and had not read the text to have been able to fill in the beautiful memories of her life that were omitted. I just felt let down. Sorry."
2,mediocre,"In my opinion, no movie does any book justice. The book version is always better. This one is not a great remake of the book. I bought another version that was better. Would not highly recommend."
1,Not even as a stand alone,"I have watched several film remakes of popular books, and I know that inevitably things will be changed. The important thing is that the movie be able to stand on it's own, so that even with the changes you embrace it. Not this movie. I actually couldn't wait for it to end - the acting was bad, the casting was even worse.... I think that sums it all up."
1,This is NOT the SHELL SEEKERS,"This film bears only a passing resemblance to Rosamund Pilcher's THE SHELL SEEKERS. The director watered down the book's powerful plot to weak tea and you will barely recognize the characters. Angela Lansbury does her best but cannot help the tepid writing. The casting was almost completely off the mark - Danus is particularly badly cast. I expected a better film from the Hallmark Hall of Fame. This was so bad it took me 3 trys to get through to the end. Don't buy it. In fact, it's hardly worth renting. Reread the book instead."
3,A slow moving storyline.,"Although I liked the movie and the story within, I thought it moved along rather slowly. Angela Lansbury is, as usual, an exquisite pleasure to watch."
2,Just not interesting,"The Shell Seekers stars Angela Landsbury as an elderly lady who suffered from a mild heart attack, yet her true heartache seems to come from those around her who want to conrol her choices. She must struggle through this dilemma in order to reach her true happiness.The movie itself is, of course, slow-paced, dialogue-heavy, and on the dramatic side; nothing wrong with these qualities per se except that I did not find the story, as it is presented in the movie, to be very interesting.The combination of an uninteresting story along with the slow-pace made it a rather dull experience to view this movie. I'd recommend you read the book instead."
5,Like hearing it for the first time...,"Just seconds into the Rasumovsky 1, you know you're in for something special here. Not only are these the finest sounding that I have heard, but the Takacs technical skill is matched by the emotion they display in playing these middle quartets. A note on the recording-I'm finding that there is a big difference in some of the CD's produced now-vs-even just 2-3 years ago. The four instruments are perfectly balanced and the recording is faultless. I immediatley bought the Takacs early quartets and they are just as fine. The Beethoven cycle of quartets is some of the most beautiful music written in my opinion and the Takacs are now my first choice. I can't wait for their release of the late cycle.."
2,quiet. then loud.,"This recording takes the dynamics to the point where some passages are barely audible and you have to strain to hear them and then as you're straining and your ears are completely open and unprotected you get hit with the frying pan. It's like being abused with music. An anxiety inducing recording. Tried listening to it numerous times, now I'm either donating it to the library or perhaps simply throwing it as far away from my person as I can without damaging my rotator cuff."
3,"Okay if you are interested in matehmatical ""classics"".","I agree, to some extent, with the recent two reviewers: Nobody can deny that Emil Artin was a great mathematician, having done a very good job in algebra. That does not necessarily mean his textbooks should be praised *ad infinitum*. I understand some classics remain valuable for an incredibly long period of time (""Morse theory"" by Milnor is one of such landmarks that comes into my mind), but I feel scheptical if this one deserves that claim. This book is okay if you are interested in his writing style of many years ago, but not quite so if your main concern is to study Galois theory (or algebra: that makes no difference for that matter) efficiently and effectively. In that case you should turn to more modern textbooks like Cohn (""Algebra"" published by Wiley.)"
5,Perfect Brief-Everytime!,"I have been purchasing this Brief for years and I will never get tired of it or move to another one. Okay, maybe that is lame because different, sometimes better Briefs come out in the Market, buy why change something that works for you PERFECTLY & is still available? I have always been pleased greatly with this item and will continue to purchase it, where I can find it. Some department stores quit carrying this particular one but I keep searching. It was nice to find it here at Amazon.com!"
2,Unusable after two days.,"I picked these up for 4 dollars at a local home improvement store. These gloves stood out for their comfort-- they fit very well, and provided a better range of movement than the other available cowhide gloves-- and for their price.For the past two days I have been moving heavy logs, splitting, and stacking them. Yesterday I put on a brand new pair of these gloves, and when I was done today, there were three very large rips around the thumb of the right (dominant) glove, and one large tear on the pinkie of the other glove. They were damaged to the point that they no longer provided the protection I needed for my work.I would have given these gloves 5 stars for comfort, but gloves simply need to last longer than two days. For now I will use my old gloves (thinner, less confortable) that have been put through the same kind of work for the past three years without any tears."
4,A Window to Civilizations of the Past and Present,"As far as world civilization textbooks go, this one proves to be the most useful. The book spans from Paleolithic icemen to the industrialized peoples of the 20th century all around the world. Included are timelines within each chapter summarizing major events for the chapter. They are short and to the point. Lovely and helpful pictures appear on every page. As a person reads through this book, the begin to be able to make connections between social, cultural, political, and economic ideas in each civilization and then follows up on how each civilization develops throughout time. It is an excellent textbook for people who want to start studing world history."
4,Good book,This book does a great job of highlighting world societies. I used it back in college and kept it for an interesting read every now and then. Great buy.
5,A Breath of Fresh Air in Today's World,"Rarely do I find a book I want to recommend to my friends as much as ""The Smithy Miracles"". Starting on page one the author develops his main character with realism. He makes you feel the heat of the burning marsh and the warmth of a father's love.I find it to be a thought provoking, well-written story. A great read. One that is short enough to be read again often!"
5,Great Christmas present,"Reading the last page, I felt my face smling and all I could think was beautiful! This is an easy read about a loner who could be you -- think Adam before Eve--a guy who has made his home in the great swamp and leaves to look for -- call it purpose, place, home. The author wakes up a level like a whole other world.. and it doesn't let you go. A gift that keeps on giving.Jacqueline Heriteau Hubbard"
3,"Good book, but gets too technical too quickly","The first chapter or two are very clear, but once it gets into higher-level converters, it should have more explanation. The author falls back to equation after equation and more graphs of signals would have been helpful."
2,delta sigma book,"Hi,I bought this book sometime last month. Received it couple of weeks back. It was delivered promptly, but the book print quality seems to be bad. In fact it looks like a fake! Looks more like a photocopy of the original book. So much for paying this kind of money to buy the 'original'."
5,Good book for beginners,"This is a good book for beginners to have an understanding of delta-sigma design concepts. There are also practical examples, along with examples using the delta sigma toolbox.It doesn't hurt that it's written by Schreier, a respected figure in the field of oversampling modulators."
1,Difficult to assemble and cheaply made,"I am usually adept at putting things together but this chair was challenging since many of the holes for screws didn't align properly and it was impossible to put together properly. Furthermore, there were no directions concerning the wheels/casters at the bottom. I thought perhaps it was self explanatory but when trying to put them in,they didn't seem to latch in and everytime one sits in the chair it practically collapses because of a loose caster. Spend the extra money and get the same one that is likely higher quality at pottery barn...and comes assembled!"
4,container,"Extremely difficult to open tin.Bought 2 - friend could not open either. Had to get a man to work on them with tools (hammer and screwdriver)Prince Of Peace - Tiger Balm Ultra, 1.7 oz creamand finally got them open."
3,OK,"This book was OK, but totally not one of my faves. This book is about Claudia and Alan. Claudia really likes the way Alan is right now, but something is missing in him...could it be his humor? Is Alan trying too hard to impress Claudia? to find out, read this book!"
3,Falls a little short,"I loved the original of this movie by Brian DePalma. I own it and have watched it a number of times and still enjoy it. It is very original, tense and macabre.This remake is lacking a bit. They took some liberties with the story, which didn't make a big difference until the ending. That's where everything took too big of a turn for my liking. They completely missed the point of the serum and left doors open for a follow up (which I hope they don't do).All acting was done well. Sets were very good and cameras where excellent. No fast forwarding or multiple images, they kept it clean, which I do appreciate.The music... that's another story. It didn't fit. It didn't help to build or keep tension as in the original. Another big piece of the puzzle missing.I would recommend this movie only if you've seen the original. Otherwise, wait until it comes to television, which shouldn't be long."
2,Go Watch the Orignial,I actually the remake first and then the original. The remake show up on showtime. I know its was basic off a Brian De Palma movie. I hope it was good. The only reason I gave this two start because of Chloe Sevigny & Stephen Rea. I like both actors. This script was horror and the ending was even worse. It made no since. I some movies try to have a weird ending or open ended. This movie should be watch at it. Its not the worse movie I've seen. I recommend in this case stick with the original. I got the original on Netflix instant. If you must see this film use ur netflix or rent it from redbox.
3,Final fling,"Though it sounds apparent the dire duo's corrosive chemistry was running dry, they fade out on this respectable note of upbeat, half-sour laments."
3,NICELY DONE BEYONCE...NEEDED A LITTLE MORE FINE-TUNING,"While I would agree that Whitney's version of The Star Spangled Banner was one of the (not THE) best versions out there, I don't think that Beyonce's version was horrible: definitely unworthy of only 1 star. Beyonce has a totally different style than Whitney, et al., in my opinion. Anyway, I think that there have been some other fantastic (Star-Spangled Banner) performances that have been glossed over which need to be reviewed. I thought the following performances where magnificent: Pavarotti, Cher, Gladys, Aretha, LeAnn Rhymes, military man (forget name of performer--opera version)etc....Does anyone know if the following artists had sung the Star-Spangled Banner?: Luther Vandross, Patti LaBelle, Clay Aiken and any AI winners."
4,It Wasn't THAT bad...,"I agree with Johnny: no one's ever going to be able to touch Whitney Houston's performance of ""The Star Spangled Bannner"". There are some who don't like it or feel that it can get better, but they are just deluding themselves. Now onto Beyonce's performance. It was more like a 3.9, than a 4...I watched the Superbowl when she sang it (the Pats won that year)so I know that she did it well and that the sustained high note on the ""free"" was secure, but I just can't remember how she sounded. They even replayed it on ""Oprah"" and I still can't remember. I know Beyonce has an amazing voice and she has very good control over it, but I'm thinking it could've at least been a bit more distinctive, otherwise it wouldn't have faded so easily..."
1,Poorly Done!,"Fist of that version of the national anthem was the pitts!I mean all of those train and carrying on was ridiculous! First off no one will and ever sing the National Anthem like Whitney Houston! Beyonce did an alright job! People are making that up to be something its not!Thank You for your time and consideration!!Sincerly Yours,A Music Major at Florida Stae University!"
3,Exile and the Kingdom,"You get the first impression of the book in the first chapter when Camus states (paraphrasing) that we are all free lords of our own strange kingdom. We control our thoughts and our actions; whether the outcome be our view of our Kingdom, we all believe there is one, and we are constantly trying to obtain it. Though the book is a bit easy, it was a good refresher of Camus...how liberating he can be sometimes!"
3,My least favorite of what Camus did....,"I've read out Camus: his philsophical treatises, his plays, his novels, his cahiers, etc. and been tremendously impressed by almost everything that he ever did. I find him brillaint, but even more importantly, humane. That having been said, I find the short pieces contained in Exile and the Kingdom (and, strangely, the French translation of the same..... he he) to be some of his most regrettable work....Not to quibble... or to say that these aren't that important or contain something of use.... but if I were a new Camus reader, I'd definately go and read the rest of his tremendous body of work before I settled down to read these..... my specific criticisms come in line with the rest of the negative reader reviews (i.e. somewhat lack plot or devices to hold interest, etc.)"
4,A really good book with a repetitive message,"After you've read one, the point behind all the other stories in this book are the same. In each story the main charater must choose between living a ho-hum life or taking a chance and heading twards there own personal kindom. Unfortunatly in finding there kindom they are exiled in one form or another.With so many stories leading to the same conclusion, the point of the book is embeded into your head. They were all well written and I enjoyed the whole book, though I must admit I understood some better than others"
5,Made a great gift,I purchased this as a gift for my daughter-in-law as the case for her set was badly deteriorated. I had initially intended to make a new one from scratch but when I started to price out the components and wood for the project I found that buying this one from Amazone was a better value.
5,fun and accurate,I love this little bird! I actually was able to use its likeness to accurately identify one of these little cuties in my front yard. Very fun!
1,Useless,"You are better off buying your kid a pair of scissors. This toy requires the user to move the cutter VERY, VERY slowly to get it to cut through the paper or foam. It's not very accurate, doesn't do a great job cutting, and requires D batteries. Waste of money."
1,Don't Buy with younger children,"Purchased, installed batteries and returned. May be OK for 8 and above, but if you have younger children, don't buy. The cutter can puncture if held against skin. I now know what it must feel like to get a tattoo."
1,Dangerous!!!,"This toy is dangerous!! Don't buy it! The 'cutter' is really a metal point that jabs in and out of the pen and perforates the paper- It is seriously just like a child's version of a tattoo needle! It claims that the point is safe, but it is sharp enough to perforate a child's skin too.I originally thought this would be a fantastic toy for children, but was highly disappointed when I realized how this supposed 'safe' toy really worked."
1,Seriously . . .,"I am in no way a prude, but holy cow is this thing dangerous. The reason I am even looking it up on the web was because I was SURE there would be a recall on it. My wife got it for our 5 year old and besides not really cutting, it IS a tattoo needle. Can't think of any other reason to own it really except to do bad prison tats in your own home. Good thing my boy loves tattoos and we got him the pack of 500 tattoos(removable). I guess when he's older he can whip this thing out and get started on the real thing. Sheesh. Shame on you Crayola."
2,Too hard for younger kids..,"My daughter is almost 6 and we got her this for Christmas. The commercials made it look really cool and easy for kids, no more scissors! Well we opened it today and it's too hard for her to hold the button down for any amount of time and to move it around slowly enough to actually cut anything. I'm having to do it all for her and my hand gets tired too! They should have made it that the ""pen"" cuts when just being pushed on the paper or something. I have a 9 year old also that was trying to use it and it wasn't all that easy for him either. Seems more like something teens or adults that scrapbook would use."
5,All crafters and card makers need this..,"Maybe the kids don't like it, but I can assure you, I do.I took it to my stamping and card making club to show after Christmas.They all wanted one after seeing mine. I prefer this any day over an Exact-o knife. You don't have to turn the paper to cut. Just 'trace' with the tool, and it cuts for you. Super easy to make openings in small doors and windows. Lots of fun and easy to use.However, it must be used with either paper or light card stock. Nothing heavy. Well worth the investment."
5,Very Good!!,"I always like using the TDK's both single and double layer!! I never had a problem with these!! I know that the single layers are becoming obsolete but, I still have a need for them occasionally. Plus, they are very inexpensive!!"
1,Can you say cardboard with cheese flavor,Like the other Doctor Kracker Snack I reviewed they are as hard as a rock. Reminds me of pasteboard with cheese flavoring.
2,Very healthy but the flavor isn't great,"I ordered these and got tired of them quick. I love healthy snacks but these lacked flavor and were almost too hard and crunchy to chew. I ate them with hummus which was ok, but when I tried to eat them plain, I couldn't even get through one little pouch. Great concept but needs more spices to make them tastier and more flavorful. I am dissapointed that I wasted my money because I still have almost all of the packages sitting in my cupboard and I probably won't eat them. My dog likes them though, so maybe they will become his treats for awhile so I don't feel guilty about throwing them away."
5,"Delicious, hearty cracker!",I love these crackers. They are high fiber and low carb and remind me of a whole grain Cheeze-It. They are definitely dense and hearty so if you're not a fan of whole grain they might not be for you.
2,A careless CD,"This CD is not bad at all. But this CD make the music of India something terrible, like demons. I really don't like this so-called India's music CD."
2,Of questionable value,"The inside back cover of the 1990 edition demonstrates what you can do with a vocabulary of difficult words. ""Don't let your nolition about noegenesis keep you nolens volens from your nomic noesis."" For those of us dummies who don't understand some of the difficult words, the translation is provided: ""Don't let your unwillingness about production of knowledge keep you willy nilly from your customary cognition."" If you like these kinds of sentences, you will like this book. If you want to be taken seriously, use your American Heritage."
4,Curiosity (almost completely ) satisfied,"I can't be the only person who has wondered about the private life of public religious figures. Star Magazine or People don't go into what the rabbi and his wife do or the priest and his, and movie stars were never as enigmatic. Robert Warren Cromey tells you a great deal about his own sexuality right there in the 220 pages of Sex Priest, exactly how and when it was troublesome, and it what ways it enhanced his calling as an Episcopal priest. He shares with the reader the type of personal information many of us want to know about those in our lives and rarely get the opportunity to find out. A fascinating book."
1,"Great idea, if reversed","This is a great idea but they've got it wired backwards in my opinion. Your hands have to stay under the detector for a few seconds for it to click on but if you so much as spread your fingers it detects the loss of your hands and shuts off instantly. This product would be a 5-star product if it worked the opposite where it would instantly start when your hands went under it but would take a few seconds to shut off afterwards or when it detects the hands are no longer there. That way it doesn't shut off when you move your hands away for half a second. Great idea, done wrong. Had to remove mine as it's useless the way it's currently programmed."
2,Let down,"I thoroughly enjoyed Broderick's first effort, but this one is a let down. Many of the same jokes are on the first CD. The only good part was the new songs he sings on this one, but they were not worth the price of the CD alone. If you haven't heard the first CD yet, buy it you'll love it. If you have bought the first CD, Buy at your own risk."
3,Stories for Bedtime,"Salman Rushdie is an excellent writer in general. He likes to write fantastical stories based on common everyday things. This book brings together stories from the East and stories from the West. My personal favorite is ""the Prophet's Hair"" about a family that sets out to find a professional theif to steal the latest addition to their father's collection and, hopefully, restore the family back to normal. There's only one story that seems to not fit and tends to be confusing: it's a rewriting of Shakespeare's Hamlet. I think you'll enjoy all the rest, though."
2,"East West, this is not Rushdie's best!","Sure, there's imagination in this book, but the language used to put it across is not worth talking about. It was a major disappointment after I'd read Midnight's Children and the Moor's Last Sigh. It's not a book worth buying and I'd only advise borrowing it if you're really bored (or curious, I suppose)."
2,Not the best book in the world...,I guess if you are very in to Salman Rushdie's works this book would be good but I had trouble getting threw it. The language was excessively complex. The language alone made the reading of the book unpleasant. I love books but I can't say I enjoyed reading this one.
4,Best Lay I've Ever Had,"This vibrator lasted me about five years; I haven't had many, so I don't know if this is on the long end of life-expectancy for these things, but I considered it to be a steadfast product. And it drove me crazy. In a good way. The rotating shaft broke after a couple of years, but the clitoral stimulator, which lasted till the end, hit me in that amazing, specific way that I simply cannot communicate to a partner and not because I don't know how to express myself. It cut my orgasm time by 75%, hence great for quickies or when I'm having trouble with a partner."
1,Disappointed,This product was twice the price I paid for my last vibrator and is half as effective. I wouldn't buy another one.
2,Not for those well-seasoned in women's studies,"After reading ""Women's Inhumanity to Women"" and ""Tripping the Prom Queen"" this was a disappointment. Maybe if I hadn't read the others first, it may have been eye-opening. As it stands, if you want to the real dirt on women's relations, this might be a good introduction. If you're like me, this poses no new revelation."
5,BEWARE!,"I agree with RedTunicTroll's review - I've waited a long time to see this great album re-issued on CD (hence the five star rating). I would add that the remastering is excellent. However, I am very sorry to say that Varese (the re-issue label) has substituted an alternate demo take of ""Country Boy"" instead of the full band version that appears on the original album. The version of ""Country Boy"" on this CD has just Cash with his guitar. It's a nice version of the song, but the one on the original album has Perkins on guitar and Grant on bass. I know this for certain because I have an original copy of this album from the late 1950s - it's a very beat-up copy, but it plays well enough for me to say without a doubt that Varese made a mistake!"
3,Black and Bleak,"Not great, but has pretentions. Sick family gets reality based corrections. Please, could the Farley brothers peek at the script."
4,She's so sweet,"Drew Barrymore is a doll in this short story comedy about a southern gal finding a father of her child. At first, I thought it was a comeback of the movie, Annie at the first glimpse of Sally at the burger drive in. I just love her charms besides her glossy lips. Although funny, the only criticism that sparks in this comedy is that Sally, who is so young and innocent and who got pregnated by an overwhelmingly older man should deliver a message to young girls to be responsible on their bodies. This is rated PG, so I would strongly urge parents out there to render advice. That's all folks, otherwise, it is a great comedy for the entire family to watch."
1,B - O - R - I - N - G!,"This couldn't decide whether it wanted to be a romantic comedy or a black comedy. No matter which it was trying to be at a particular moment the dialogue is CONSISTENTLY delivered in a oddly-rythmed mono-tone mumble (mainly by Luke Wilson but Drew is also guilty). With no sense of tension, hint of a logical plot, or ultimately even a climax, the movie simply peters to a bland end leaving one thinking ""WHAT A WASTE OF MY TIME"". I would have given it zero stars if possible."
3,"Above average, but not especially funny","As usual with Hollywood ""comedies,"" there's really nothing actually funny in this dark comic caper film. I didn't laugh, but I did watch, and you may, too, if you like Drew and Luke. This 1998 film gets them at an early peak. The plot is the weak link here for me. It strains credibility, as if two jamokes from the local air National Guard could get away with flying a helicopter anywhere they please on personal errands. At least there's no violence to speak of. It's a gentle little movie, with a very cheesy cover that may put some off from even picking this one out of the overcrowded murk."
3,Hmm,"I rented this movie, and am glad it was just a rental instead of a purchase. A young man meets the girl that his father was having an affair with, and finds out that she is pregnant, the baby is his half-sibling. He starts to fall in love with her, but his newly-widowed mother will have none of it. Dad died at the beginning of the movie from an heart attach, Mom was responsible for it because she told her son to scare him, and son scared him all too well, so he also has to live with this. It's an interesting movie with a cliched ending, so I give it 3 out of 5 stars."
1,"Drew Barrymore has made her ""opps!"" movie once again","Drew Barrymore has been having a hard time making good movies after making the the movie ""Ever After"" which i thought was a OKAY movie,which i gave **.but home fries was a horrible movie with a messed up script and plot.plus i thought it was too dark to be a comedy.*"
1,Bland And Forgettable.,"I watched about thirty minutes of this movie and turned it off. The plot was totally silly and I can't figure out why a movie this trite would be released. Home Fries just wasn't any good. I admit that I didn't watch all of the movie, but when I have to turn it off, that's ample reason to rate it on the low spectrum. Try something else besides this."
1,The WORST movie ever made. bad bad bad,"This is the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life. I now compare all bad movies to this. If I don't like a movie I always say that was a bad movie, but it's no Home Fries."
3,DVD's,I recieved the item in very good shipping time. I am not crazy about all the movies in the pack but for the price I will say it was a good deal.
3,weird,"This movie was so weird, i thought it was goign to be about drew barrymore meeting a guy i didnt know all the hidden details..and the helicopter..i saw this with my friend april and now we say everything is ""homefried"" if something weird happens..weird weird weird movie...we laughed the whole time..you should see it to experience the weirdness"
1,2-D caricature of a black comedy,This movie is awful. I am neither a Drew Barrymore fan nor a detractor. It seems her fans are the few that actually like this movie. The plausibility factor is zero which absolutely guts the humor premise. A good part of my tastes embrace dark humor but this movie looks more like an elaborately staged non-funny improv. They were reaching for Repo-Man but managed to bottom out under Peggy Sue Got Married instead. If you read all the reviews you will find someone who mentions this is the stinker they use to grade all the other movie farts. I agree whole-heartedly with that assessment.
1,Too Out There,This movie was just way too confusing. The twists and turns were totally out there and not believable (as opposed to a good movie which would have unbelievable twists) If you have to see a Drew Barrymore movie of the second phase in her career this is not the one. If you think this is going to be a lighthearted romantic comedy think again. I suggest buying either Never Been Kissed or Ever After which are much better movies for Miss Barrymore than this one.
1,"Dull, Dumb, Dud","I found this movie to lack any redeeming qualities. You can tell it is attempting to be a ""witty, offbeat film"", but I didn't find any particular wit ... anywhere."
2,BORING!! But barley okey,This is the dulliest unsatisfiting of all time . Even though Drew Barrymore is in it . It still doesn't steal the show . The middle was okey but the rest was just plain Garbage .
1,Unbelievably BORING!,"I really like Drew Barrymore and that is why I rented this movie, expecting it to be funny and romantic. The movie is slow, the acting is slow, just not good all around. I couldn't even finish it! Sorry Drew!"
4,"Weird, but funny comedy-drama.","""Home Fries"" is basically a dysfunctional comedy-drama about two brothers out to kill their unfaithful father's mistress, a fast-food cashier, because their vengeful mother (Catherine 'O Hara) asked them to. The mistress, Sally, who is nearly 9 months pregnant (Drew Barrymore), unwittingly charms one of the brothers (Luke Wilson) and falls in love with Sally. Then, things go downhill. The other brother, Angus, figures out Sally is their dad's mistress, and Wilson wants to protect her, because Angus wants to kill Sally.Despite the dysfunctional plot, ""Home Fries"" is affectionately charming, witty, and not exactly seamlessly fits comedy, romance, a little mystery, and drama. All in all, ""Home Fries"" is good family fun, despite its PG-13 rating.Rated PG-13 for thematic elements, language, and brief violence."
5,In Good Order,"As a fan of both New Order and Joy Division I looked forward to hearing this cd.Great cd. Some wonderful performances and not a bad track out of all of them.All of the tracks are treated with the respect real fans of the band would wish to see.Highlights for me were Kremelin, Evaluna, Flight and especially the C Bentley track.A must for all New Order/ Joy Division fans."
5,Splendid Production,"Brideshead is a splendid production, just as compelling now as when it first premiered. And I find the DVD quality excellent.Brideshead Revisited (25th Anniversary Collector's Edition)"
2,What's wrong with the Acorn release?,"This 30th Ann. edition suffers from the most washed-out, faded, overexposed looking digital transfer I have ever seen. I quit after the first episode (and spot checking some others). And this was on a new Aquos 65 inch flat screen. What was Acorn Media thinking when they put this out? Was the original material in that poor a condition? I returned my copy for a refund."
4,Good-but be warned,"My parents watched this version and said that the acting was very good. They said that it remained mostly faithful to the book but changed a few instances. However, the one major problem they had with it was that there is a very explicit scene. The back of the movie says that it contains content that is inappropriate for children, and parental guidance is suggested. However, my parents said that they would never have shown it to any children since it had the equivalent of an R rated scene and nudity."
2,Pretty & Grotesque...,"I fail to grasp why this thing gets such grand reviews...certainly Mr. Irons is a taciturn personhood, great & scopey...yet, this series is folly with a dash of travesty."
2,story that goes nowhere,"Having seen all the five star reviews, I thought this was going to be a winner and looked forward to getting it. It was a real letdown. Without going into the storyline, let me say that it was a waste of time. I like stories that have endings that are satisfying. This story was not one of them. It seems that all the characters in this story have no happiness. The only thing I liked about the story was the scenery and sets which were top notch. If I could give it a grade, the sets and scenery would get five stars and the story only one or two. Save your money and if you want a long story, buy the Pallisers. It is so much better than this one."
5,Wonderful return journey!,"I so enjoyed revisiting Brideshead. I believe, due to the fact that I am thirty years older, it gave me a different perspective on many of the underlying issues in the film. But the bonus features were so incredibly informative. It gave so much more meaning to the film. The entire complexity of what the producer, director and all involved had to work through due to the strike in England made me wonder how this marvelous production ever got started again after it had to shut down. The bonus feature of the director narrating the actual making of the film and interviews with the actors today is marvelous. This trickles down even to the final resting place of Aloysius, the teddy bear.I so enjoyed my return journey to Brideshead!"
4,2nd Try on DVD Much Better,"The packaging is superb. However, the first disc would not even play. In fact, my DVD player wouldn't even recognize it as a legitimate DVD and told me that in just so many words on my TV screen. I received (in just 3 days, thank you, Amazon) a replacement copy, and the result was magnificent! I have loved this series ever since it first aired years ago on PBS. This edition (if you get a decent DVD pressing) is indeed a brilliant restoration."
5,It Has Everything,"This series movie version of the book follows it exactly; in fact, the screen play dialogue was lifted right from the book. So, what is it about? A terribly rich and interesting English family before and during World War II, and a sophisticated young Englishman who falls in love- at various times - with everyone in the family. It is charming, exhilirating, sad, and insightful. If you love things British, or things about the style of the 1940s, and haven't seen this yet, you have a great experience awaiting you. Catholics and Athiests, you need to take a broad approach to understanding this one."
5,A GREAT ADAPTATION,"EVELYN WAUGH'S WROTE A GREAT NOVEL ABOUT A WAY OF LIFE THAT IS NO MORE,AND THIS TV SERIES IS ONE OF THE BEST ADAPTATIONS TO FILM OF A REALLY GRAT BOOK.I THINK THE ACTING WAS GREAT AND THE HISTORICAL ACCURACY SUPERB. AND OF COURSE ONE MUST NOT FORGET TO MENTION CASTLE HOWARD WHO WAS IN MY OPINION ONE OF THE STAR PLAYERS IN THIS FILM.TO GETHER WITH THE ""JEWEL IN THE CROWN"" THIS IS ONE OF THE MAJOR FILM CLASSICS OF OUR TIME.IT IS A PITY THAT DESPITE THE FACT THAT BOTH WERE PRODUCED SOME TWENTY YEARS AGO NOTHING COMPARABLE HAS BEEN PRODUCED SINCE THEN. I HOPE THEY ARE NOT THE LAST OF THEIR KIND.WITHOUT DOUBT A GREAT PIECE OF FILM MAKING."
3,Get out the razor blades.,"Great acting, Great scenery, excellent directing. However, be ready to get depressed and maintain that depression for eleven episodes. Considering I had not read the novel, I was not quite ready for such overwhelming darkness of material. Not a character is anywhere within a hundred miles of either happiness or contentment. Though well done, it leaves one with a sense of just watching Sylvia Plath demonstrate kitchen stoves in a department store window. This series is but an encouragement and marketing tool for anti depressant pill pushers."
3,Badly in need of subtitles,"MARVELOUS STORY AND BEAUTIFUL PHOTOGRAPHY BUT LACKING SUBTITLES. HAD DIFFICULTY UNDERSTANDING SOME OF FLAT ENGLISH ACCENT DIALOGUE, ESPECIALLY JEREMY IRONS WHO SPEAKS IN A VERY LOW REGISTER. TURNING UP THE VOLUME DID NOT HELP AS DIALOGUE WAS COMPETING WITH BACKGROUND MUSIC. DO NOT HAVE HEARING PROBLEMS BUT THIS STORY WAS A CHALLENGE TO FOLLOW AT TIMES."
2,Brideshead Revisitied,"The beginning of Bridesheasd Revisited is very slow moving and, at times, difficult to understand. The protagonist is more of an observer as he narrates the story of his life and his involvement with the eccentric and wealthy young Oxford student from Brideshead. The DVD was not of good quality and got stuck after episode four so I was not able to see the complete film. Perhaps it got better as it went along; I will never know."
2,Brideshead digitally ruined,"Brideshead Revisited: 30th Anniversary Edition. Not a happy anniversary! Subtitles and extras galore, but unfortunately this edition digitally altered the image and entire look of the series. Now everything is cleaned up and ""whitewashed"" and the patina of the original look and beauty is all gone, bleached out. The actors look like they are made of plastic, like Barbie dolls: not a wrinkle left! There's not much character left in these bland faces, and nobody ages over the many years of the story.What a bad job in an otherwise rich DVD set!Renate Stendhal, Ph.D."
5,Brideshead Revisited --- A Story of Love and Loss,"Evelyn Waugh is well known for his humorous stories. This is not one of those. Brideshead Revisited is a story of love and loss...mostly loss. Written after his harshest critic, his father, had died, this is a baring of a soul. The narrative prose is the closest to poetry of anything I've read and is unutterably sad. This production is very faithful to the text and features a stellar cast (Sir John Gielgud and Sir Laurence Olivier for starters). Added to this is photography one wants to print and hang on the wall. Set in the English countryside and Venice the views are stunning and only add to the sense of paradise lost. I think this was the BBC's finest and most lavish production."
5,Quite a show,"Marvellously acted, beautifully shot, this excellent and detailed film rendering of Waugh's best novel is well worth a look. Let's put it this way: for bit parts they throw in Sir Laurence Olivier and Sir John Gieldgud. While the basic tenor of the tale is heartrending regret, there are moments of truly inspired comedy scattered throughout."
2,Disappointing,"Other than the setting, i.e., Lithuania, I found the book a great disappointment. More suited for children's literature."
4,BIRD,"DVD collection of Charlie Parker recalls his fantastic abilities. Good selections, but things that I have on other DVDs. Recommended to those who have little or no Bird flix!"
5,None better,"This must certainly be the best played Mahler 7th ever, just for the outstanding performance of the Berlin Philharmonic this recording is a must; but Abbado's superb reading is a must-hear too. It doesn't matter how many versions you own, this is truly an extraordinary recording that demands to be heard."
3,Skimpy info,"The information on anything but the major cities was fairly skimpy. It was organized reasonably well by geographic location, but within a location was difficult to use. The maps were decent and conveniently placed. Recommendations on restaurants were sparse and inaccurate."
3,Not that great,"It is certainly a useful book to have with you when travelling in these places, but I was a bit disappointed on the ""opinion"" side of it. I.e. it's a very useful reference resource in your backpack, but it's rather hard to plan a trip relying on it. In city desctiptions, the author tends to get carried away by colonial history and gives hardly any insight at all WHY would someone want to go to these places. So: have one with you when you leave home, but get some others to back you up before you decide where to go."
4,Book,Book arrived in great shape and was exactly what I expected it to be. Great service and prompt shipping. Nothing was a surprise and no compaints.
2,A sharp knife is a better choice,"I build cabinets as a hobby and use about 500 feet of edgebanding a year. I was getting sick of using a razor knife, router and sandpaper to flush the edges. So I decided to spend some money on ""the right tool"". But after trying the Freud EB-090, I would not recommend it.On the positive side, it is faster and safer (than the way I usually do it).But clearly outweighing those advatages are the following...- you need a good, sharp blade and these are not blades you can sharpen yourself. Replacement blades cost half-again the price of the trimmer.- I just can't get good results. Hand pressure and other factors affect the quality of the trim.I could improve results with more practice, but my decision is to return the gadget and spend the money on a good trimming knife and bandaids."
3,Difficult blade setup,"When I purchased this tool it worked fabulous! Now since I've had to replace the blades I cannot get the same results. There are no instructions on blade replacement setup at all, even on their website. Now it sits in the drawer and I'm back to sand paper and exacto knives."
3,Its Okay,"After using this tool, it is good for only trimming certain types of wood veener or taped edge banding. It is not reccommeded to trim laminate."
3,Trims nice when it stays together,I bought this edge band trimmer because I was familiar with the manufacture name Freud. I have quality saw blades from the company but was a little disappointed by the design of this tool. When not in use the two halves come appart too easily allowing the spring to fall out. When I store it I have to wrap a rubber band around it to keep it from falling apart. Other than that it works great while in use.
5,Freud EB-090,Great little tool. I use a lot of plywood in my little projects. I like to cover the edges with banding and this tool is great for making it look smooth and natural.
3,meh,It works good on Formica laminate but it's kind of weak and fragile. The blades last only so far and the replacements are expensive. There's no way to sharpen the blades and the adjustability is marginal.
5,Slide bingo cards,"These were ordered for a senior active retirement facility that plays bingo at least twice a week.The cards are easy to see and hold,the slide function does away with the need for chips and trying to fit the chip in a way to still see the numbers."
3,A Good Guide for WWII Books,"I found that this book was not only helpful in narrowing down the choices of the many books about WWII, but also in informing the reader. However Dunnigan can tend to write very lengthy summaries of each book, which can sometimes be a turn-off. I love history, but I also love English, and because of this, I noticed the greatest number of grammar mistakes and type-o's in any one book I've ever read. These can sometimes be a nuisance, for you may have to re-read sentences to make sense of them. He can also go from scholarly sounding to tired/lacking sounding. But he can also be humorous in some of his definitions and witty comments. Though I did have some frustrations while reading this book, I found it to be a helpful and educational guide to the 50 must read texts on WWII."
4,Interesting Introduction to Philosophy,"While another review on this book points to the fact that it does not cover ""the classics of philosophy,"" I found it to be an interesting introduction to the discipline. This book was required reading for a Master's level philosophy course, thus I was ""forced"" to read it. But, I found it to be enlightening due to its nature.I have tried to circle through some of the ""classics"" and often have a difficult time relating them to the modern world. This book, in using modern writers, does a great job of connecting the basic problems of philosophy to the modern day."
1,"Decent Content, terrible format.","I had to purchase this book for a philosophy class I'm taking, and it's been painful to read. At first I thought it was because I'm used to my kindle, but when compared to other paper books, the printing is awful. It feels like I'm staring at a wall of text, and the lines tend to merge together. There needs to be more space in between the lines, and it would go a long way if the pages were not so bright. I think this is the first book I've ever seen with this problem, and I hope it's the last.As far as the content of the book is concerned, it's about what I'd expect from a basic philosophy book, so that's not really an issue."
4,Interesting,This book is a bit confusing for a beginner philosopher. i suggest reading ultimate questions by rauhut first because it helps to understand this novel.
3,The Resourceful Caregiver: Helping Family Caregivers Help T,"This book is an excellent starting point to help caregivers know where to look in seeking help. The range of resources is broad.The world of area codes and caregiver information, resources and support is rapidly changing. Even though some numbers and detail may be out of date, nonetheless just knowing the types of resources available and where to begin to go to get the needed help is an important first step in the caregiving journey."
5,Modern Hard Guitars,"Finally some good guitar tracks. Chris is working hard on his own way. In a range that goes from techno hard rock to dub, with one acoustic track, you get everything you want if you like tough guitars. Not an HM cd (like Rollins Band where Chris play) but a clever and straight hard guitar with a little fusion with jazz and techno. He is not a ""God"" on the instrument, that saves him from the boring ""listen to what I can do"" stuff. Better than Vernon Reid on his solo projects, I would say."
5,A Sharing of Methods,"This is a wonderful book in which LaPlantz shares with the reader her approaches to plaiting baskets: Straight Plaiting, Spiraling Plaiting, Randing, Bias Plaiting, and more. I have to say that if LaPlantz herself drew all the diagrams in this book, showing the over/under patterns and shape of the basket as it progresses, she must have spent a Very Long Time doing so: the book is generously full of scores of such drawings to help the weaver. LaPlantz's approach is never to impose a pattern upon the weaver. Instead, she teaches method, tells you what you should be doing and looking for as you weave. The pattern itself is up to you. Such an approach is encouraging and liberating. If you enjoy weaving baskets and want to expand your horizons, read this book."
5,Schiller,"This is the second edition of this book. The Translator spent years on researching and putting Schiller's works together. He worked closely with the Germans to make sure that he got this right. However, the second edition has the Translator's very own poem; The Translators Apology To The Reader as he had to make some corrections in his own translating. Schiller was a controversy of sorts in his time. Many of his poetry has to do with his one love Laura, the lady who first captured his heart, and had great impact on his life."
5,Essential Reading,"Bil Tierney has succeeded in contributing a very broad in scope and in depth look at the ""Dynamics of Aspect Analysis"" that is as understandable as it is rich in content. Highly recommended...a wonderful resource!"
2,Movie was a disappointment,"I bought an old 2004 used copy of the movie because I love Sophia Myles acting. Based on the director comments comparing it to The Others and Sixth Sense, I was expecting a ghostie or two, but there wasn't even one. I guess the caretaker standing in the yard saying he didn't go to THE WOODS relates to the gardener in The Others, also the little girl saying her stepmother was MAD. Couldn't find anything that reminded me of The Sixth Sense. Too slow moving, too contrived, a lot of the plot didn't really make sense (she had so many opportunities to leave and didn't), none of the acting rang true like you expect in a movie, and of course the ending stinks. I'll donate it to the local library instead of saving it to watch again."
3,Out of Bounds to my expectations,"I was expecting a better romantic scene (only one) for my favorite actress, Sophia Myers.Maybe its the British accent that made me to rewind several scenes to fully understood the speakers."
4,Tales from Phonographic Oceans,"Where are the scores of unreleased gems that we know exist(Paris sessions, We Can Fly From Here, tour songs, etc)? This is a band that is near to my heart so I must give it 4 stars for the collection of great music that it is. But why Howe would choose Arriving U.F.O. over Silent Wings of Freedom and not even include Ritual or Awaken is beyond me. And You and I would have been nice but it's always on these things (But remember, Steve, we got a sub par live Trevor Rabin And You and I on Yesyears so the time may have been right for the proper version). At this point a live box set would probably be a better idea as this is one of the greatest live bands in rock. Ultimately, though, I'm just happy that there's enough interest in these guys to warrant such an elaborate box for yet another generation. This is a great way to warm up for the Aug 17 Dallas show!"
3,What's Next?,"I was mostly disappointed by the missing single version of ""I'm Alive"" which was issued for the most part on single cassette tape format.As far as the reissue bonus cuts are concerned I feel only a few would have been of the calibre to include on this set.I feel these bonus cuts are better doled out on the reissues of the original albums which were remastered.It would take at least an eight cd collector's set to include the group's best material to my satisfaction.The same situation could be said about the recent KINKS box which is sorely lacking in completeness.I found that to be quite a disappointment and didn't purchase same."
5,A Solid Box Set for Someone Starting on Yes - not for rarities.,"This boxset is a very good complete set for someone like myself, who has enjoyed Yes over the years, but is not an obsessive collector of their work. I have owned the Yes Album, and I have borrowed other albums from friends over the years, and taped or burnt copies of them. I have always wanted a more complete set of their work on CD, such as with the Led Zeppelin box set - but was not compelled to purchase many CDs of individual albums. Due to the length of many of the songs, a two disc best of would not work for me, I don't want the single versions or edited tracks. The book and the packaging are terrific, and the sound is incredible.If you are a completeist or obsessive, this is NOT for you. I hope (and am sure) that someday there will be a boxset of rarities or even better live shows from over the years for you."
4,In A Word,As a long time fan I bought this boxed set to replace all the old Yes catalog i had on cassette.most of the well known songs singles and album tracks are there except for a few there are too many later day songs which is my only complaint. more of the 70's classic songs could of been included instead. the last boxed set Yestory had a better selection of material but this one has all the famous songs.recommended as a mix of songs collection for any rock fan getting into this band. if you a real yes fan you need to get all the orginal albums. a 4 rating!
5,YesYore,"Judicious choice of tracks by Steve Howe makes a seemingly inessential purchase (how many best-of's/repackagings from the band in recent years?) hard to pass up. Disdaining the live tracks, solo meanderings (The Fish?), and subpar B-sides that afflicted Yesyears, this 6-hour package sounds and looks great. Nothing (incl. America) is abridged, and liner notes make a strong case for Yes rivaling King Crimson as musical pioneers. Packaging, as always with Rhino, is exemplary."
3,Where is And you and I and Awaken?,"The only reason to boy this box set was that it was remastered. Some songs are really improved in the process. But, to my dissapointment, two of the greatest Yes songs: And you and I and Awaken are not included. This is inconceivable. Whoever was in charge of selecting the songs must be nuts (sorry Yes). The extra tracks (Richard, Tango, etc.) are not goot at all. Maybe were included to get some new buyers to those who already have Yes Years, like me. No more Box Sets, Please. Rhino should remasterd all the previous cd`s and sale it as a package."
2,Politics and social justice,"What are Cornel West and Jim Wallis doing in a book about Catholic social teaching? Professor West sees the world almost entirely through the prism of race, while Wallis is best known for providing cover for abortion rights politicians with his Sojourners organization. Yet somehow Mich endorses works by both of these partisan figures in his book. There are useful things to learn from Mr. Mich, but the vision of social justice on display in these pages is frequently politicized. (One of the accomplishments cited by Mich is lobbying for a reallocation of funds from a large tobacco settlement toward favored political projects.) That isn't surprising; Mich is employed by the Diocese of Rochester, a redoubt of progressive politics and doctrinal dissent. Readers are advised to seek other resources, and they might consider learning what the Church teaches about social justice. Fr. Rodger Charles'sAn Introduction to Catholic Social Teachingis a good place to start."
5,Mmm Mmm good,This is a very hilarious CD the first time around. Trust me you won't get tired of their cereal and clinton jokes. Chris really cuts me up!!!!
1,n'sync is #1,"hi my name is ashley and i love N'sync they are so awesome and what do they want in a girl, would they go out with a fan,do any of them have a girlfriendand i want thme bad."
5,Historian Decribes Role Air Stations Have Played in Texas,"""Aviation buffs and fans of 20th-century Texas history will find plenty to please them in this well-written and often entertaining work."""
3,Nostalgic but a Bit Predictable,"A large part of the episode is a power struggle between UNIT led by the Brigadier and another high ranking British official. The British official is too stereo typed and predictable in his motives. The intentions of Axos is also obvious very early on. As a result, this story doesn't build up a lot of tension but plays out as you might expect. Just too black and white for my tastes.The Axonite's appear in two forms. I rather like the costumes of their humanoid form. Very effective for a show on a budget.Jo's role in this is to run off on her own and get in trouble and then scream for help. The better Who stories would get the companion more involved."
3,"This isn't up to par of usual Pertwee action, but still fun!","Don't get me wrong, there is some action, but not enough; and there is not enough plot to hold it up. This is a fun one but not as good as it could have been. There aren't enough good lines or plot threads but this is still a rather fun entry in the Pertwee series.Note: In episode 3 (?), about five minutes into it, watch for the doctor to trip over the prop and fall right on his face!"
3,Extras not extra,"Of course I would purchase any of the Dr Who DVDs, but Claws of Axos and City of Death extras leave to be desired.I always look for the ""Who's Who"" section as that tells you of other things that guest stars have done and also if they are in other Dr DVDs. These two left that part out.The Pyramids of Mars had a nice little section of what the evil villan (hisss) did after he was defeated by the Doctor. Ok, cute once but not again.I hope that the BBC corrects these things and just doesn't throw the Doctor into DVD format to grow rich quick."
2,Why are they doing a special edition?,"Why in the world are they releasing a special edition of ""The Claws of Axos?"" This is one of the worst Jon Pertwee stories ever made! Terrible plot, appalling acting from most of the guest stars, oddly phallic monsters, and the last few minutes of the plot, including the last action scene, are ridiculous! I scratch my head at the wisdom of a special edition of this one. It's one that this die hard Doctor Who fan will skip."
4,Not the Best Story,"This isn't the best Doctor Who story of all time, but what is interesting is that until now this release simply couldn't have happened as the technology to improve the picture quality simply didn't exist. This story only existed as a poor quality US (NTSC) copy, so in order to make it release worth a highly intensive process called Reverse Standards Conversion (RSC) had to take place. This essentially unpicks the picture to return it to it's original PAL glory (for UK release). For the North American release the picture is then converted back to NTSC only using a much more sophisticated technique to that done 30 years ago. The improvements are startling.Of course the release also contains the usual dazzling set of extras."
2,NOT ORIGINAL ARTISTS,This is NOT a compilation of Original Releases. It is a DEMO of publishing co. Soundtracks.
3,In the realm of the supernatural,"As a purveyor of anything supernatural, I found this video to be a decent account of bizarre phenomena. The video comprises mainly of interviews with witnesses to poltergeist and other behavior. At times the video is of poor quality to the point where it is hard to see and hear images and voices. But, the video weaves interesting tales that provide entertainment and helpful hints for research of this phenomena. A last note is that the video may only be interesting to those that are truly serious about the supernatural. This video is not for people who's main purpose to buy is to frighten themselves or others. With that note....enjoy!"
3,WRONG MOVIE!!!!!,"For goodness sake, Amazon...you've put the WRONG reviews with this DOCUMENTARY! These are reviews of some sci-fi movie. Very misleading and your people are not paying attention!!!!"
4,"Combs' is back, and this time he's meddling with the beyond.","Another H.P. Lovecraft adaption brings our hero Combs into brushes with bizarre death again, this time coping with extra-sensory forces, and his own professor. Witnessing a bizarre act of transmutation, Combs is considered crazy except by a female psychologist. However, when he proves his rantings, things are taken too far, and a series of bizarre events ensues as he himself becomes transmuted into something un-earthly. Great film with some moments of humor, but only for fans of Combs and Lovecraft."
2,Not Very Faithful,"A film adaption of H.P. Lovecraft's short story ""From Beyond"", there is little in this movie that will attract Lovecraft's readers. The scientist is portrayed as a man who was into kinky sex (and as anyone who has ever read Lovecraft knows, he would NEVER have included such details in his stories), and uses the addition of a police officer and a lady who seems to become possessed by the spirit of the dead man to eat up the majority of the plot. Great if you're into gory movies or Lovecraft, but this is really a throwaway."
1,Stereotypical Witches,"This is the worst example of stereotyping of witches I've ever seen. It should be renamed ""4 Hours of ads for BAD Witch Movies."" All the depictions of witches in this video are so negative that it definitely leads one to believe that all the bad publicity given to witches is justified."
2,A little too small for a 6 month old baby,My daughter is 6 months old and loves all Playtex baby stuff but these literally fell out of her mouth - the nipple is very small and more suited to a new-born. Just hope the 6month plus is a better size.I gave them two-star for the easy-clean 'hole system' in the back... great idea.
5,Perfect Latex pacifier,"My son will not take the silicon pacifiers, so I have to order these online seeing that most all stores only carry the silicon ones. He loves this binky, so we're sticking with it!"
3,ok,"i was expecting pieces with better piano music, but if you are looking for songs to just sing along with while playing, this is a good book for you."
1,I'm unhappy !!!!,"I didn't receive this item. I live in Brazil and I asked to a friend of mine, who was in the United States, to bring it to me. The package was sealed, but the blades were not inside."
2,somewhat interesting characters but poor plot and dull,Compared to the John Sanford prey series or the Michael Connelley Detective Harry Bosch seriesthis is pretty dull. There is no getting into the mind of the criminal at all. I also felt no intimaterelation with Detective Jury; there is very little about his life problems or what he is thinking as hetries to solve the murder. It is just aplodding questioning of suspects with little if any real police procedure or scientific analysisof evidence. If you like British dialogue with weird names of streets and towns then this may appealto you. Some of the characters were interesting but that is it.
1,Painfully Boring,"Honestly, I have no idea why Martha Grimes is so popular. This is the only novel by her that I managed to slog through, and I hope it isn't characteristic of how this author usually writes. This was one of the most boring attempts at a mystery that I have ever encountered. The plot is pretty much non-existent, the characters are completely one-dimensional and often practically indistinguishable. There are endless attempts at very tortured jokes that are supposed to pass for a sense of humor.The only reason I forced myself to finish this horrible book is because I really wanted to know what is it that makes so many people like this writer. Nevertheless, I still have no answer to this question."
1,Not really helpful tool,"Product name is misleading twice - it is not high precision because one has to get really close to the skin, even then and the hair will not be cut close to the skin. Trimming is difficult with it because hair is not captured in the nozzle and knife in a swift way as with previous tools I used."
1,Remington HPNE 3000,I wish I had my money back. This device lacks the ability to effectively trim the unsightly facial hairs I purchase it to trim.
5,A most useful book,"As a former corporate executive and a former member of the boards of directors of several non-profits, I can only wish this book could have been available years ago. Just think what I could have accomplished! I certainly recommend it for people in similar positions now.In contrast to so many business oriented books, this one is engagingly written and eminently readable"
4,EXPLORES AN IMPORTANT SYMBIOTIC OPPORTUNITY FOR BUSINESS.,"This book shows that through forging alliances, for-profit and social sector organizations (private and governmental) can address major problems facing both such as declining funding for nonprofits and shaky global markets for business. Such alliances can improve the bottom for business by enhancing image, reaching new markets, increasing consumer loyalty, and building a positive reputation with employees and prospective employees. Nonprofits stand to gain in raising funds, increasing visibility, and attracting new volunteers and donors. The authors cover philanthropic, marketing and operational exchanges and offer guidelines in setting up such partnerships. This book explores an important symbiotic opportunity for organizations. It opens some potentially fruitful strategic pathways. Recommended."
4,Samba lovers,"My son who lives in Sao Paulo turned me on to her. I bought this album and am hooked. i play it all the time. She has a beautiful voice and a talented band behind her. Soft, easy music."
1,Where's the rest of the song?,"According to Joel Whitburn's ""Pop Singles Annual"" the song ""TallahasseeLassie"" peaked at #6 in 1959 and is 2:30 long. The cut of ""TallahasseeLassie"" on this Collectables Label CD is only 2:11 long. Hey Collectables, where's the rest of the song? Can we look forward to seeing the missing 19 seconds on a future release? Why would you release an edited (shortend) version? For those of you who would like to have the whole song, it is available from vendors here on Amazon: ""Freddy Cannon--His Latest and Greatest"" on the Critique Lable."
5,"Preserved In Amber - When Music Could Be ""Fun""","Freddie was never Elvis, Buddy Holly or Chuck Berry, nor do I think he so intended. What he did was to make a series of radio-friendly fun records, a bit offbeat, over a very long period. Some try to dismiss him as a ""novelty"" record guy, but that's not true. This CD would be fun even if you were born in the 80's and have no idea who ""Boom-Boom"" even is. And if anybody questions his chops, play ""Tallahassee Lassie"" for them. Kenny Paulsen's guitar playing here is on the same edge of heavy metal as that in The Guess Who's version of Johnny Kidd's ""Shakin' All Over"", but Kenny's a better player. He sounds a bit like Cliff Gallup, Gene Vincent's original guitar player, and that's high praise. His intro riff is a killer, and the cut just flashes brilliance! The whole CD just illustrates the fact that ""fun records"" could exist then but don't now - and there's nobody like the intense Freddy Cannon to do them, either!"
5,What a wonderful book!,"This is a wonderful book of a great man. Ms. Llywellyn's love of her heritage and its history just screams out from every page. Brian of Boru was a great and wonderful ruler, and this author has made his life come alive. We see Brian as he lived every day of his life - always in search of the greater good which included a united and peaceful Ireland. We see him as a warriar, a lover, a father, a Christian, and we see the lives that he touched. We also get an intimate portrait of his women who were each as remarkable as him in their own way.The battle scenes in this book are excellent and beautifully written. As I read I felt that I could hear the crash of the swords and the grunts and groans of the dying men. This is an awesome historical novel, and I recommend it whole-heartedly."
5,It's what words were made for,"I am no Morgan L. fan. I am no Celt fanatic. I am no history buff. Having cleared that up...this is definately one the finest written books I have ever read, and I read quite alot. Like many others writing these reviews, I first read this book when I was around 15 and was amazed and delighted with the story. Since then, I have read the book many times, or just browsed my favorite parts (when Brian is 'ambushed'!), it never fails to capture me and pull at my emotions. I picked it up the other night and discovered that the many handlings of it have placed it in an unreadable condition, so I came here to look it up. If the price had been fifty bucks I would've paid it. It's worth it. I consider my life 'better' with the enjoyment I continue to get from this book. What else can I say? GET IT."
2,A bit too sappy for me,"Though the book was well researched, it was a little sappy. The characters were quite one dimensional and the four women in the book were devoid of personality. It's hard to believe that a woman wrote this book. Where was the suspense? The drama? The free will? Great history lesson though - more children's book than adult novel."
2,interesting book,"just beginning it, of irish decent and this is written by someone I believe is a relative of mine. cool"
5,Lion of Ireland -- a great read for everybody,"Lion of Ireland is one of the most interesting, well-written books I've ever had the pleasure of reading. Llywelyn clearly portrays life in 1000 AD Ireland.I've read it and The Pride of Lions twice and am still entralled. Llywelyn tells Boru's story in a way that both the serious reader and the pleasure reader can enjoy.Even if you're not a history buff, the tangled love story and fantastic battle scenes make it a book anyone can read and revel in.Thank you Morgan Llywelyn.I connected so much with the characters, I named my daughter after Boru's father, Cennedi."
5,A truly magical book,"This book is a master piece. This was the best book I ever read and I should know I'm only 13 but I've read more than my share of books. This should be turned into a movie, Brian of Boruma makes William Wallace look like a child. And if they're lookin for somebody to have a small part like Turlough I'll gladly play the part."
2,Trite and predictable,"I was excited to read this book based on the reviews, my love of history. I was extremely disappointed. The characters here are one dimensional, uttering predictable catch-phrases, and are basically uninteresting. I got through about 200 pages and couldn't even finish. The main character is increadibly driven, and consequently his reactions throughout the story become entirely predictable. He has no depth and the author doesn't create any kind of sympathy, empathy, or interest between the character and the reader. I really didn't care what happened to him or any of the characters in the book. I think I'll stick with Bernard Cornwell, or Sharon Kay Penman."
1,Worst book I've ever read!,"I don't know who the target is for books like this, but I found it painfully bad. As a student of Irish history, I can tell you this book is not only poorly written but historically inaccurate. Not that perfect accuracy should be the goal of a fiction writer, but how about making an attempt at being accurate as well as entertaining? The book rambles on and on with little motivation for the character's actions or substance in the writing. Some of the passages are just laugh-out-loud ridiculous.""His face looked like a linen napkin"" Really? What does that mean? It was in someone's lap? It was covered in gravy?The author makes use of (often misspelled) Gaelic words throughout, but doesn't include a glossary. Are we supposed to be impressed? It just makes the sentences awkward.Avoid this book at all costs.If you want authentic, well-written historical fiction, stick with Pressfield or Rutherford. I just wish I'd read this one first before I'd ordered more by the same author."
4,Loved this book!,Morgan Llywelyn mixed history with facts and wove a grand tale of the history of Ireland. Didn't want to put it down.
4,Lion of Ireland great story,This is a history of Ireland told in an adventurous manner. History can be so boring not this time. Thank you.
4,An Irish Legend Comes to Life,"Brian Boru is an Ireland prince who has big plans for himself and Ireland. Tenth century Ireland is a very volatile and violent place with Vikings raiding and pillaging and the Irish fighting each other. Brian dreams of uniting Irish clans and sending the Vikings elsewhere to pillage and plunder. How does this man become a great legend in Irish folklore for centuries to come?This book has everything - wars, battles, violence, politics, strategy, romance, love stories and great character development. I highly recommend this look at Ireland's history."
4,Good Historical Fiction,The reviews for this book were promising so I decided to pick it up. I was not disappointed. Having lived in Ireland for a short time I was interested in learning more of the ancient history of the island and this book was a fun way to do that. Llywelyn masterfully tells the tale and keeps the reader engaged throughout the story. I will be reading more from this author.
5,Lion of Ireland -Morgan Llywelyn,My husband and I both loved this book! My husband and his cousin have done geneology work and found out that he is related to Brian Boru on his mothers side. We can't wait to read the next book! It really captures your attention from the first time you read the first chapter and it's really hard to put down.
1,it's a shame shame shame...,"..that julia child's name is even used in conjuction with this book. it should be called the whiny, unrelentingly self absorbed brat, julie powell & what she's complaining about today.. the woman has no talent. it gives me great pleasure knowing julia child never read this overpriced piece of crap! she used juila child to gain fame & tricked us all into believing she actually cared about her, about cooking & about being a decent writer. stick to your blogs, julie. that way you can just disappear into the masses of mediocre writers & name droppers where you belong. ps- i was routing for your husband to leave you the entire time."
1,Insult to Julia and Food lovers everywhere.,"I gave this book one star, if at all possible i would have given it zero. Being a Foodie, I picked this book up hoping to find a book about this woman and her attempts at following in the great Julia Childs Whisk-prints, and instead about 100 pages into it i realized that i was taken, robbed and the joke was on me. Julie Powell is a woman who hated her life, her job, and wanted to get rich off of a dead womans reputation and i think its despicable. There is not one Iota of Julia's amazing spirit in the pages, only Julies filthy mouth, kitchen and monotonous repetitive monologues. Oh, she hates eggs, and uses wonderbread to make recipes, we get to hear about her brilliant idea for a blog and how everyone loved the way she wrote, I am not sure if this womans nose is brown because of eating chocolate or because she kissed her own self righteous behind too much.If you love Julia, do not read this, its full of insults thrown her way."
1,What a Disappointment,"Although this author is witty and has a definite way with words, I found her to be a whiny brat. In her wry manner, Julie displays a lack of respect for most people she encounters, camouflaged under a cloak of humor. I did not expect a cookbook, but hoped for a more engaging story of ""self-awakening"". I put the book down because I could not spend another moment with this individual, who mistakenly finds her histronics an amusing topic of interest for eveyone."
3,It's OK...as long as you're not a Republican living in DC,"I was so excited to read this book as Julie seemed to be just the type of person I am: fascinated by cooking and one who picks crazy projects for life milestones. Then I read the book. Though it was a fast read and there were some good parts, I didn't care for her personal views of politics, society, friends, or Washington, D.C.Nevertheless, I have been inspired to drink gimlets, never attempt the feats of French cooking, and realize people are just different.I was happy to read and finish the book but it isn't something I would run out and share with others."
3,"Sometimes funny, a bit disappointing on the whole","There were some funny moments, but on the whole I found this book a bit disappointing. As I read it, I was surprised about how much of the focus was on how annoying she found her project. Oh well. I'm glad I read it, just wish it had been a bit more fulfilling for me."
2,"Uninteresting author, and market to the wrong crowd","This book was not horrible, but it wasn't very redeeming. I asked for it for Christmas, and squealed with delight when I actually got it. I'm very sorry now that my husband wasted hard-earned money on this.I'm only half finished, but I doubt that I will be finishing it. It is not about cooking, and as everyone else has said, foodies will not like it. It is not inspiring, and there is nothing to identify with. You can't even root for the author. She is crass, full of foul language, discriminatory, boring, miserable, and thoroughly uninteresting.This was my first forray in to a foodie-type book, and I'm scared to ever go back."
2,What a disappointment!,"After reading My Life in France I couldn't wait to read Julie & Julia. I was hoping to read about someone becoming inspired, growing as a person, embracing life ala Julia. Instead the personal account struck me as whiney, self absorbed and uninspiring. What a disappointment!"
2,Very disappointing and very shallow,"Ms. Powell's book, which I eagerly anticipated, bombed as far as I'm concerned. A complete disappointment. Flippant, ignorant about food and cooking techniques, Ms. Powell is hardly the person to be taken as an expert on food, even if she did cook a lot of Julia Child's recipes (and yet Bon Appetit and other publications, including The Washington Post, are falling all over themselves offering Ms. Powell writing assignments--it goes to show how much such publications really do seek new, fresh voices in food writing--take note, all you food writers out there!). Superficial and not worth the time."
2,A big disappointment,"I disagree with the reviewer who characterized the author as a poor writer. She isn't. The problem is the content. After reading the first 90 pages, I put the book down, finally admitting to myself that I really didn't care what Ms. Powell thought or opined about anything. I was finding her blog-turned-book to be just one more rant from a neurotic New Yorker, a genre for which my tolerance peaked several years ago. It was never that high to begin with.Unfortunately, a friend had given me the book, thinking I'd enjoy it because of my fondness for Julia Child. Maybe that contributed to my reaction to the author. Juxtaposing herself with Julia Child invites one to think about issues of character, style and substance. On all those measures, Ms. Powell suffers.My recommendation: see the movie, but forget the book."
2,"Great concept, but not enough about the cooking","As a librarian, I usually don't buy books, but I was so excited about this one, I bought it when it first came out. Sad to say that I couldn't even finish it. I was hoping for more insight on Julia Child--more on the recipes--more on the food. What I got instead was a lot of unrelated, self-focused rambling about a New Yorker's life (and her friends). Perhaps it has been mis-marketed. I have a sense of humor, but I didn't get into the sitcom-style whining about 30-something life. I felt as though I was wading through the mire of her life just to get to any good parts (and some of us cook in far worse kitchens--get over it!). I sorely missed the recipes and the passion for good food."
1,Too self indulgent,"As a writer and a blogger, I expected this story to be so much more. It was not at all about Julia Child. Julie was no working class girl if she was raised in a home with Mastering the Art of French Cooking in the kitchen. She'd been around the block a few times.Julie did use the word f*** too much. It stopped being funny on about page 10. Her references to September 11 was tasteless even if they did revolve around her job as a secretary. Plus the writing in general was terrible. Julia Child should have been pissed at her. This story was tasteless.Linda C WrightAuthorOne Clown Short"
2,Catastrophic Hissy Fit,"How do you take an idea with so much promise and turn it into an excruciating read? You allow someone like Julie Powell to write about it, that's how. Never in my entire life have I found the narrator of a book more irritating than I did Powell. More a filthy-mouthed diatribe of her whiney ways than the entertaining cookalogue it should have been, had Julia Child lived to read ""Julie & Julia,"" undoubtedly she would have deemed it just as disrespectful and non-serious as she did Julie and her ""project."" I wanted to like this book; I really did. In the end, however, it's nothing more than something Powell claims to have regularly on subway platforms: a catastrophic hissy fit. One can only hope the movie fares better, but then again, it could hardly do worse. Two stars for managing to steer unlikeability and awful writing to the top of the bestseller chart. Kudos for that amazing feat at least."
3,Don't take it so SERIOUSLY!! Lol,"No, this is not a book for foodies, not a chance. It is a book for people who are struggling to find purpose in their mundane lives, and aren't afraid to laugh at their efforts.Yes, Julie is a pain in the ass, but aren't we all if we were brutally honest about our behavior when undertaking new and difficult (and sometimes ridiculous) tasks? That is what makes it funny!This book was a tad slow in some areas, but I laughed out loud at a lot of the writing. I think I would definitely choose Julie as someone I would like as a friend.Gimlet?"
5,Great and unique book,A lovely and unique book. I found the main character so relatable in so many ways. I loved the combination of history with current memoir. Great book!
5,"Can't put it down, have laughed out LOUD!","Yeah, maybe there's more swearing than I personally would contribute - but she's VERY funny and a total drama-mama and a blast to read. I look forward to the next one ... keep up the good work Julie!"
1,POLITICAL ONLY,WHY DID SHE FEEL THE NEED TO KNOCK REPUBLICANS AT EVERY TURN? A REAL SIGN OF LOW INTELLIGENCE. SPOILED BOOK COMPLETELY. SHE IS VERY OPINIONATED IN ALL HER THOUGHTS AND FILTHY TALK TO BOOT...THINKS SHE IS SOPHISTICATED...BAH.BAD BOOK.
3,I did laugh alot,I picked up this book because I heard that it was Norah Ephron's next project and I love her movies. I laughed alot and did enjoy it but sometimes got a little bored with the food talk. I know it is a book about cooking so I excpected that but I enjoyed her random chatter the most.
4,An easy and fun read.,"After seeing the movie, I expected to be bored with the book. Not so. It's fun to read something you can just enjoy and not have to think too hard."
2,why did she have to bring in politics?,"fun book to read. i imagine that powell writes exactly as she speaks, which i love in a writer. however, i wish she would have kept her constant comments about her political affiliations to a minimum. why did we have to read every other page that she hates republicans.?.?.once was enough...we get it! i was expecting a light read about a woman having fun cooking a legends food and almost quit reading when i had to stomach her constant assault of the grand ol' party. democrat or republican (or as julie powell would say ""pure evil""), who wants to read about someone's politics in a supposed book about a cooking journey?"
5,What a great book!,My family likes to read aloud in the car on trips abd we just finished this book. What a terrific read. I really like Ms. Powell's writing style and thought that the last page was masterful.I can't wait for Ms. Powell's next book/blog. I would love to be able to buy a bound copy of her blog as I think that would be fun reading on its own.
1,Leave out the swearing please!,"This book would have been ten times better (and half as long) if she had stuck to her cooking experiences. I could completely do without her foul mouth and her completely unrelated rantings about politics and sex. This book had great potential, but doesn't deliver. I fervently hope the movie version takes out the garbage and only keeps the good stuff."
1,Do you want some whine with your meal?,"At first when I saw some negative reviews for this book I thought it was just sour grapss. Wouldn't every blogger want their brilliant ramblings transformed into a book?I love food memoirs, and this one has such an intriguing premise. But I found the writing flat, and there seems to be so much griping and whining about her husband, parents, friends, and the loft where she lives (which is constantly and annoyingly put into quotations, as ""the loft.""The narrative rambles, gasps, and coughs. After about 120 page this just went nowhere for me and it was too painful and boring to pick the book up again after setting it down. I give up."
1,Republican bashing at its finest,If you like Republican bashing then this book is for you. Whatever happened to the days when people kept their political opinions to themselves. You've lost half of your audience. Your ratings speak for themselves.Being a foodie I was hoping to be inspired. The only morsel I got out of this book was that Julia Child has a recipe for a garlic sauce. I will now confiscate my mother's copy of Mtafc.
2,Glad I bought it used. Wish I hadn't bought it at all.,"Interesting idea, funny moments, and the author seems like a nice enough person-- However, about the third time I got to a gratuitous insult of Republicans, I put it down. Why is this okay? Apparently, just anybody's political opinions and beliefs aren't worthy of respect, only Democrats'. How incredibly liberal and tolerant! Lesson learned, and won't be purchasing any more of Julie's words."
1,Don't waste your money,"Seriously. This book was a waste of my time and money. The writer tries to be too witty and ""cute"" and ends up being vapid and tasteless."
1,Don't buy this book,Very bad nasty language and sex take over this book. This is an insult to Julia Child and French cooking. The author's 15 minutes of fame are over. Purchase a Julia Child cookbook for inspiration.
2,Julie and Julia,"I was very unimpressed by this book. In this case, the movie WAS so much better. The language and subjects talked about in the book were very offensive. The only reason I finished the book was because I payed ten dollars for it and I was past the two-week return date."
4,Good read,"I enjoyed the book a lot, it was fun, unique, and the best part was knowing that the book is a true account of how Julia Child's helped to change her life! I will say, as did many of her blog readers did, the use of the F-word is a bit excessive... just not my style."
1,Rotten egg,"If there is a rotten egg rating, this one is it. A self-absorbed writer who cannot cook decent meals blabbering on how marriage-worthy she is than Julia Child, thinking this is a good joke; well, if you think you have a sick sense of humor, read on. I had to let it ricochet to the trash bin by the first third of the book. This book does belong to the trash."
1,Couldn't even finish it,"I've been an avid reader since childhood and I can count on one hand the times I haven't finished a book. This one falls into that category. I love cooking and Julia Child so I was looking forward to reading this. Despite the overuse of profanity, the endorsement of destructive behavior(encouraging friends in adulterous affairs) and the incessant bashing of ""evil"" Republicans, I pushed on. I'm 3/4 of the way through the book and I'm done. I just can't take anymore! I usually read Amazon reviews before spending money on a book but on impulse picked this up at B&N. Lesson learned! SO glad I didn't waste money on a movie ticket!"
2,Not Funny,"I was really disappointed with this book. I loved My Life in France. I laughed throughout the movie version of Julie & Julia. But if I had read the book Julie & Julia before going to the movie, I would never have gone to see the movie. Julie Powell isn't funny. She doesn't make you want to try any of Julia Child's recipes. I'm no prude, but using profanity all the time just isn't funny. When I read a biography or autobiography, I usually want to meet the person. I never want to meet Julia Powell."
1,More Complaining than Cooking,"Julie and Julia is probably the most disappointing book I have ever attempted to read. I got to page 81 and gave up, something I rarely do. I like to finish what I start! Julie Powell does nothing but complain. She seems to totally lack a personality, while her poor husband Eric has to put up with her nonstop foul moods. In the pages that I read, there is very little actual cooking being done. She mostly talks about her crappy job, moving,her crappy apartment, commuting, a visit with her parents and brother, and going to the doctor. I expected this to be about each recipe she mastered, but it's not. Read My Life in France by Julia Child and Alex Prud'homme instead. Very satisfying indeed!"
1,Hope the movie is better,"This is one of the few books I have not and will not finish. I had such high hopes for this book. I forced myself to keep reading thinking at some point it might actually improve. Who is she writing this book for? It surely can't be for people who actually know who Julia Child is. Ms. Powell writes like a spoiled, foul-mouthed 19 year old who could care less about Julia Child or her cooking. Her repeated and irrelevant political comments, her lack of compassion for the 9-11 families, her incessant and inane daily mental breakdowns....and very little about cooking....made me realize that if she can get published...anyone can get published. This is a terrible book. As I did not finish the book, I can only hope that Ms. Powell did not quit her day job."
1,What a waste on all counts!,"If you are thinking that this book will be as charming as the movie think again! I read about 70 pages and gave up which I normally do not do. Julie Powell disappoints on every page. She manages to drop the ""F Bomb"" frequently and get a few digs in on the Republicans both of which did not add to the book. Julie, if you are reading this, you owe me $8.00!"
1,0 stars,"This was probably the worst book I have ever read. It was the best idea, in the wrong person's hands. All Julie Powell did was complain, and whine. This book is not for foodies, because there was not enough mention of food. It was bascially a book about her political views (which were too strongly voiced), and her insensitivity about her job (talking to 9/11 victims families only one year after it happened). Poorly written and very disappointing."
1,Terribly written,"Even though I was looking forward to reading this book, I was disappointed. Julie Powell is a terrible writer. She seems to have a boring relationship with her husband, an unsatisfactory sex-life, and a quite bitchy attitude. This would have made for interesting reading if well written. Powell should have stayed writing blogs, since her style does not translate well to books."
1,Julie and Julia 365 days 524 recipes.....NOT so Great!,Can I give this a Zero star? I thought it was going to be a light hearted book about cooking and blogging. It was dark and I think some things were meant to be witty but fell short. NOW there is a Movie about this book and I can honestly say that I hope that the movie is better than this book. It had lots of mistakes and then it seemed to me that the author was all over the place. Sometimes you just sort of want to throw the book at the wall or then you just sit there and think WOW she actually got a book deal and a movie deal out this. ONLY in AMERICA! Thumbs down and a zero star. Why did I really buy this book? I got it on clearance for 1.99 and the cover looked great and the back of the book really lead me to beleive that this was going to be a very intresting read. AGAIN NOT the case!
2,Casting query,"I sort of OD'ed on this. First I thoroughly enjoyed reading Julia Child's My Life in France. Despite Child's own confessions of arrogance and hostility, I willingly went to Julie and Julia, the movie, and enjoyed it, too. Then a friend gave me the book Julie and Julia, and I decided that it wouldn't hurt me to read it. Big waste of time.At one point I thought I had left it on an airplane, and when my husband urged me to talk my way back onboard, I waved him off saying that the book wasn't worth it. But it appeared in my carry-on after all.So, I finished the book. I give it a solid ""C"".Here's my lingering question: WHERE did Hollywood come up with that darling Amy Adams to render the part of the sharp-tongued, crude, and egocentric Julie Powell in this book? Let's just all agree that it gave Powell a lot of undeserved credit."
4,Laugh out-loud funny,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I was drawn to read it based on the premise, which sounded like a riot. I wasn't disappointed. No, it didn't teach me how to prepare any of the recipes, but from reading the cover description, I didn't think it would. I would strongly recommend this book if you are intrigued by the idea of reading a light hearted memoir that revolves around food."
1,Politics Broiled Dry and Unpalatable,"You can still read Powell's original blog out there on the internet...and it is not the jolly Bridget-Jones-esque diary that they are making it out to be. She is a hate-filled New York liberal woman who hates her government job, her Republican co-workers, George W, and basically anything religious (calling them crazies at every opportunity). How gleefully Meryl Streep must have read this diatribe. If ONLY the cooking elements had been on Powell's mind it would have been entertaining IF you do not mind the multiple f-bombs. Why is it that liberals cannot restrain themselves from jabbing at every turn? They can't stay on topic, like some kind of perverse Adult ADHD. Skip the book, skip the movie, don't reward hate-speech."
1,Mixed feelings ...,"Despite mentioning both Julia Child and recipes in the title, this is definitely neither a cookbook nor a useful companion to Ms. Child's masterpiece. If you want to read page after page of small print, it may be marvelous, but I was expecting a useful, practical companion to Child's cookbook, and it very definitely wasn't that."
4,"I've Been Waiting for This Moment Since August 25, 2002!","I have been a Julie Powell fan since she started her blog. I was instantly hooked and had some major loss issues when the project was completed a year later. How happy I am that she is back! I loved the book and the writing style can only be Julie Powell, though I could compare it to the Bridget Jones Diaries if neccessary. I think I liked the book better than her blog, as it was more organized, but for those of you who would like to read some of the blog AND BUY THE BOOK.Four stars because MFK Fisher is still the best, but five stars compared to current food writers (Ruth Reichel included- shudder).Julie If you are out there (and if it were my first book, I would be checking amazon or Barnes and Nobel daily looking for reviews), you did a great job, and I hope this only opens more doors for your writing!"
3,Funny modern girl,"No, this book isn't really about cooking. It's about picking a project, nearly ANY project, and sticking with it. As a floundering creative, I found that part inspirational. Ms. Powell's writing style is casual and humurous, and yes, she does curse a lot. And, no, it's not really about Julia Child at all but it might make you curious enough to find out more about her. (It did that to me). It's a light read, a bedtime/Saturday afternoon type of book. I enjoyed it immensely on those terms and laughed out loud at least once every chapter. Next I will be reading the Ruth Reichl books I missed and perusing ""The Way to Cook"" by JC herself."
5,Awesome Book Even After All the Hype,"I can't keep up with all the books made into movies. Julie & Julia was one book that I always meant to read but never got around to until now. I read this book in a heartbeat and loved it. Don't look at the star-rating because I believe that most of the people that read this book did so after the movie. The movie was totally different that than the book. The book is more in-depth and handles issues that the film couldn't get to. So, ignore the rest of the reviews. I loved this book!"
3,Good...not outstanding,Amusing..but her negativity starts to annoy after a bit. Her husband deserves a medal!
2,Boring!,"This book was so boring. I'm glad I didn't spend any time on her blog, it's no wonder Julia Childs didn't like her. It's unfortunate that someone with as little ambition and intellect as Julie Powell would get a book and movie deal. Here's to hoping the screen play writer was able to make the movie more interesting than the book."
1,ugh!,"I couldn't wait for this book to come out after seeing the previews for the movie based on the book. Now I'm afraid to see the movie! This book is really awful. The characters are not likable at all and the stuff that happens between Julie cooking is not something I want to read about. Finally, I really don't care for all the swearing. Between the swearing and the whining I was not inspired to cook or see the movie."
2,"Meh, don't really bother your time","This book was OK. It wasn't climactic, and in the end the author rubs it in your face that she made all this money from writing her blog and her book. Luckily it's a short read so I didn't waste too much time on it."
3,I dug it - Generation thing? City thing? Maybe,"I wasn't expecting to see all the poor reviews. As everyone says, this book doesn't focus exclusively on food and cooking... and from what I just read from ""the foodies,"" a sense of humor, empathy for a beginning cook and an interest in her story may be pre-requisites serious cooks 'don't have time for.' Now the reason I got a kick out of this story is because my friends and I are about Julie's age (+ a few years,) - we're city people with cramped kitchens, foul-mouths, who cook with cocktail in hand... most lack dining rooms but none lack the will to entertain in style and try new things in the kitchen. While things generally turn out these days, souffles and all, I certainly remember the days when every dish was still an experiment. Great writer? Great cook? Maybe not, but give her time. I was just glad to see her get out of that bogus job, which is more than most the people I know have figured out how to do."
1,Stay as a Blogger,"This is a terrible book. Julie Powell is, on her own admission, not a good cook and the text proves it. And on the evidence of this book she is not a good writer either. I am accustomed to swearing (it is generally a substitute for vocabulary), but the use of foul language throughout is distasteful. Perhaps her moment of fame will inspire her. I doubt it. She should stick to blogging. Poor Julia - passe she may be, but she must be turning in her grave at this travesty."
3,Fun,"This book had its ups and downs, but mostly it was a fun read. The author is young and disillusioned, and she expresses a lot of anger in the book that she was feeling at the time. But I found it to be about living a weird life in New York City at a weird time, doing a weird project. It is certinly not a cookbook as some reviewers have mistaken it for, and it is really not that much about cooking. Be prepaired for angst. I liked it. It also uses a lot of bad language, which I liked at times, but others may not."
1,How could this be a Bestseller?,"For me, this book was a disappointment and waste of time. I purchased it in October 2005 when it had just been published as a ""New York Times Bestseller"" thinking it must be read-worthy. It was not.I've enjoyed a number of non-fiction, culinary books with keeper status in my library. This was not one of them. I gave my copy to a friend, apologetically, simply because I didn't want it occupying valuable shelf space."
2,Deserves 1 start except introduced me to Julia,"Everything about this book is pretty terrible: narcissistic, whiny, boring. Anybody with a blog seems to get a book deal. So you cooked her recipes for a year, big deal. Julia actually wrote those recipes and retested them and used them for a lifetime, not as a gimmick. But it was a gift and so I dutifully read it because I like to cook and it introduced me to Julia Child so I must say thanks for that. It led me to read My Life in France a few years ago (Julia's memoir)which I loved but now I am reading Dearie, a well written biography about Julia's whole life, not just the happy bits in France, by Bob Spitz. If you want inspiration in cooking, read either of these, not Julie and Julia!"
1,Julie & Julia,"The filthy language repulsed me and removed any enjoyment I might have had in reading the book. With a mouth like that, perhaps it is good that there are no offspring to learn such inappropriate behavior. Instead of sharing the book, I have put it in the garbage--just like the language!"
2,Nope no good!,"I thought I'd like this book but once I read about the author, I really didn't care for it or her. I can see why Julia Child never acknowledged the author."
1,Couldn't get past the profanity...,"I got this book thinking it would be about...of all things - COOKING. Well, unfortunately Julie Powell felt the need to ""liven it up"" with so much profanity I couldn't even get through this book. Very disappointing. This is not a sweet book, this is not about cooking so much as it's about Julie finding more ways to include the ""F"" word into every day language. Don't let the cover fool you. This book is awful."
1,Maggots in a drip pan,"I have to agree with all the rest who didn't like this book,don't waste your time, if you love to cook then readMy Life In France, about a real woman who loves to cook.I got so tired of the Republican bashing, enough already,we get it, you are a Liberal Democrat who by the way, hatesto cook. I just can't believe she got all this fame.At least we know Julia Child found her to be not serious and disrespectful.That was the most rewarding part I read in the book!A real turn off was the maggots in the drip-pan."
1,Whining Does Not Equal Funny,"I might have had fun reading this if the author wasn't so A. Miserable. B. Whining. C. Self-Obsessed and D. Political. I put this book down on page 100, thoroughly disgusted by this exasperating woman and her mercurial, childish moods. I was so excited to read it after seeing the article in People, and I thought the idea was really inspiring and wonderful. It was such a great project and it took a lot for her to slowly whittle my respect for her, but she did an excellent job of it. This was a good idea that is fumbled in the hands of an inspipid, boring woman who I am so sorry I know anything about."
1,too much julie not enough julia,"The politics gets really old really fast as do the day to day lives of the self absorbed and rather dull cast of characters. I really wanted to like the book, but, like a number of other reviewers, I could only make it part way through. PS. enough with the F-word already. It may be hip, but it's jarring especailly when used incessently."
1,Not worth the paper it's written on....highly disappointing.,"As an avid blogger and foodie, I looked forward to buying this book for over a year. Now that I have it, I can't even finish reading it. Powell is not only a bad cook but a bad writer as well.This book doesn't stick with any audience. Bloggers think it's overrated. Foodies think it's insulting to Julia Child. Readers feel it's a bad piece of writing. Overall, it's just bad. On top of everything else, her constant b*tching about her botched recipes got on my last nerve.Boring and not really about anything, this book is as bland as an unseasoned chicken breast."
1,I counldn't even finish it!,"I had such high hopes for this book, especially after reading Powell's article in a recent Gourmet (or was it Bon Appetite?) magazine. I am so utterly disappointed in this book. If Powell had completely focused on her cooking project I would have been mildly amused. However, the chaos in her life is not entertaining. I don't want to read about someone drinking Vodka every night and complaining about the world. This book is not what I expected and I'm embarrassed that I gave it to my father as a Christmas gift. In his words, ""life's too short to waste it by reading books like this"". What a waste of money. After reading half of the book I finally put it down last night and won't be picking it up again. Such a disappointment!"
2,"Too much Julie, not enough Julia","Two stars is generous...unfortunately (and I tried so very hard) I could not finish this book and left it in a rental house in Florida over the holidays for someone else to read.Desperately in need of editing...perhaps there is a real generation gap in that I found the author to be very naive. This shouldn't be shelved in the cookbook section of bookstores--a memoir is more like it. If you're interested, take it out of the library."
1,Don't Buy This Just Because You Liked the Blog,"I read the Julie/Julia Project blog occasionally and enjoyed it. I thought that the book would be similar, but it wasn't. I don't object to irreverent opinions and random stories in a foodie memoir, but she took out too much of what made the blog fun and what she replaced it with lacks wit and charm. Powell's writing feels forced and her contrived expositions of how hip, liberal, and shocking she is/wants to be pall quickly."
2,TMI (Too Much Information),"My husband stopped reading after 50 pages. I preserved and after 100+ pages it smoothed out. When this book is good, it's not bad. When it's bad, it's horrid. TMI ..... She constantly drops the ""F"" bomb and I don't care to know so much about her or her friend's sex lives.As a fan of Julia Child, guess I expected more of the challenges of cooking Julia Childs' recipes as written. They're sort of an afterthought (maybe 2 or 3 paragraphs in a chapter) after the trials and tribulations of her life. The boredom of 9/11 ceremonies that as a government worker she is forced to witness, the boredom of her job, her dislike of Republicans, her boring fellow workers, etal."
3,Wish I could Cook Like Julia,"Julie Powell accounts learning to cook by preparing every recipe in Julia Child's ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking"", as for me, my cookbooks consists of 4 ingredients. The book describes the ways her culinary undertaking --and the blog she wrote about it- transformed her life from miserable to fulfilled in 365 days."
2,"Amusing, but...","I read this a couple years ago -- one of my fascinations in life is good foodie food, and another is reading memoirs. This book does combine these two aspects of a considered life.I read the book, and while I enjoyed it, and stayed to the end, I really wouldn't provide more than two and a half stars to this one. Since reading it, I've discovered the real world of food blogs on the Internet, with many authors who blow her book away. The concept of making every single recipe in Julia Child's ""The Art of French Cooking"" was an excellent one. I was amused by her trials and tribulations with some of the more arcane recipes and ingredients, and I'm glad she preserved onwards.But afterwards? I felt like I'd just over-eaten at an Outback, or something. Filling, but I think a few less metaphoric carbs would have helped this meal tremendously."
1,Very disappointed,"It was suggested to me that this book was really funny and very good. I wish that was the case. I found Julie Powell to be self indulgent and nasty. In the movie (which I saw first, and pretty much liked it) Julie asks her friend if she is a ""b*tch"" and her friend told her, of course you are. In the movie I couldn't see it, but in the book there is no doubt that she does live up to that unattractive title. Too bad, I was hoping to like this book, but did not."
1,read something else instead of this,I had to quit this book halfway through - I just couldn't take it and justify wasting my time trying to read it. Such dribble - nothing funny about it. Just boring - the movie gets good reviews so I figured the book would be half decent. Not so... Spend your money on any other book and spare yourself!
4,A fun idea and a fun book....,"I found this book on a lending library's shelf, and I was so pleased that I picked it up. Based on the author's blog, the story walks you through 365 days experimenting with French cooking. I quite enjoyed reading about Julie's efforts to follow the recipes, some of them quite arcane, and turn out interesting meals. There are moments when the book gets bogged down in some of the blog chat and could possibly have used some more editing, but overall it was an enjoyable and fun read. Now that I'm almost finished with My Life in France about Julia Child, I may give this book a re-read. I think both will be good prep for the movie, which I also eagerly await. Bon appetit!!"
2,Just not funny.,"I kept waiting for the ""sparkling wit"" that the cover blurb promised to show up. I would have settled for the ""laughs out loud"" other reviewers claimed to have. Unfortunately I didn't find either one. I had such high hopes for this premise, but by the end of the book I simply didn't care any more. I gave the book 2 stars because I loved the little bits about Julia. Julie was just boring."
1,Poor Cooking Related Book - Good Whiny Self-Indulgence,"I read this book long before the movie came out. I enjoy cooking, watch some cooking programs, have read a biography of Julia Child, have used recipes from Mastering the Art of French Cooking, and so approached this book as an interesting discourse on food and life and Julia Child. In all those respects, the book is a failure. The author is not a particularly good cook, does not aspire to get any better, approaches the cooking as a challenge she sets for herself (much as one would memorize the periodic table of elements or read the entire OED), does not lead an interesting (even quirky interesting) life, and has no meaningful insights to offer the reader.I slogged through the book, thankful that I do not know her or her friends. On the other hand, I do wish I could have attended a meal with Julia and Paul Child."
2,Didn't really care...for her or about her!,You know...what a great story. I love the idea of challenging yourself to something crazy...something out of the box to get you out of a rut. But boy...I did NOT like Julie. She was...I can't really put my finger on it...unlikeable. She just really didn't have a good personality. I thought she treated her sweet hubby like a dog...and her mouth was just foul...and she could care less! I thought the way she talked about 9/11 was really crappy and she whined and cried so much I almost cheered when she was told Julia Child didn't care for her! I hope they make her movie character much nicer...it will be a hit then and fiction...but at least then people will like it! I'd pass on the book if you haven't read it and wait for the movie...hopefully Hollywood will add some magic to it!
2,I did not like this book,"After reading some of the reviews I see that there seem to be two sets of camps regarding this book: folks either loved it or hated it. I guess I'll have hang out with the haters. Julie Powell comes off as an extremely unpleasant, immature little princess. It's a good idea: a year cooking from Julia Child's French cooking book but it's just so hard to read. The whole thing is snark and whine and it tiresome after a few chapters."
1,Self Involved Drivel,"So often you hear ""The book was so much better than the movie"", not the case for this book. Watch the movie, read Julia Child's autobiography ""My Life in France"" but don't waste money on this book.The author barely touches on Julia's actual influence upon this project. She's more interested in giving her friends permission to have affairs, drink too much, curse in every other paragraph, scream at her husband constantly, and give her political opinion on nothing at all.If how she treats her husband in the book is in any way reflective of how he was treated in real life then I don't understand how he stayed with her."
1,disappointed,"I LOVED the movie, so I bought the book....it was a great disappointment. The amazing movie writers did an amazing wonderful job of turning Julie Powells book into a fun movie. The Book is NOTHING like the movie. The book is foul mouthed trash. I stopped reading after 3 chapters. It is no wonder that Julia Child didn't like Julia Powells book. I was extremely disappointed. If you liked the movie.... don't buy the book."
2,Can't get through it,"Looking forward to the movie version because I think Meryl Streep is such a great actress, I decided to buy this book and read it before the movie is released. I rarely read books after I have seen the movie. Even though it is not a genre that I usually select, I was looking forward to it. I have been disappointed. I can't get into at all. . . no, I haven't finished it.I don't like the style. It is indulgent and somewhat crude at times. It isn't that I don't like the blog style; it is that the stream of consciousness style takes things so off subject most of the time that it is difficult to remember just what the point is.I wish I would have read a few reviews before I bought it. Live and learn. I doubt I will finish this book."
4,Passez-moi les pommes de terre,"I'd been meaning to read Julie and Juila for a while, but upon seeing an ad for the movie (and having an upcoming vacation on which to be able to read a book), I finally got around to purchasing it. It's a fun, light, easy read, and as I especially enjoy reading memoirs, it was a good fit for me.It reminded me of some of my own cooking mishaps, apartment troubles, and work issues, and it even inspired a friend and me to try making the Potage Parmentier after buying some leeks at the farmer's market. Delicious, and surprisingly easy! I will likely not be trying to make any of the gelees, however.I had not read the blog prior to reading the book, so I'm not sure how much of the story is repeated."
3,Cute story but drags a little in the middle,"Completely burned out from being a permanent temp, along with the constant reminder that her biological clock is ticking, Julie Powell discovers a new life hiding in 50 year old cookbook. She vows to cook every single one of the recipes in Julia Child's Mastering the Art of French Cooking in the course of a year. It's not until her husband introduces her to the new world of blogging that she discovers she may have been born to write. The story is well written and uplifting, although long narrations about boiling lobsters and extracting bone marrow can be a bit unsettling. Reading the other reviews and the critics' reviews, I thought it was going to be more humorous and fast moving. Halfway into the book, I found that reading about someone cooking lamb was not as enlightening as I would've thought. It's a light read for people who are Julia Child fans, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who's idea of gourmet is asian-style lean cuisine."
3,Book,"Saw the movie with book, and then and only then did I get a better picture of the relationship. Book as thin on Julia's life."
2,Not as good as the Movie,"I guess I should have read the book and then seen the movie instead of the other way around. The movie is much better than the book. This book spends way too much time on Julie and very little time on Julia Child. Thus, the book was quite disappointing. See the movie, don't waste money on this book, get it at the library. Also, the foul language in the book was soooooo unnecessary and offensive. This gal is no lady. The movie can never be over-rated, but the book is grossly over-rated."
4,Funny and light with a hint of meaning thrown in.,"I love cooking and this was a great light and funny book. So what if some of it is made up? So what if it was a blog? (so what if there were grammatical errors) Just like the cooking project, if it works for you then it is worthwhile. This book worked for me, I liked the peek into someone's life, I now want a project of some kind too. Don't worry I won't be blogging!"
1,"Yuck, hate the use of Julia Child's good name...","Julia was right to hate the use of her name by others, Julie Powell is the exact opposite of what Julia was."
2,its a disappointment,I bought this book thinking that I would enjoy reading it seeing that I had not yet seen the movie. Frankly I am disappointed with the profanity in this book. I am not a fan of profanity and I do not read books with such. I wonder if I could resell my copy to Amazon. That's how i feel about the book. My money is wasted. Thank goodness the movie is much much much better and there was only one profane word said only once in the movie.
2,"OK, but.........","I enjoyed the book when she wasn't cursing, dissing conservatives, and obsessing about hers and everybody esle's sex life. No wonder Hollywood came calling....though I'm glad she found her passion."
1,yuck,Awful. Simply awful. In every possible way. I would give it no stars if I could.I'm so glad I picked this up from the library and didn't spend my hard-earned money on it.
2,Not a good read,"boring, self centered, Amazing what she thinks about her job and her bosses and ...just not a good read. also NARRY A RECIPE but then just a book to ride coat tails and make some fast $$$ As far as the swear words she defends so much, without them there would really be absolutely no spice. But even they become boring and trite after awhile."
5,Best book I'vd read in a very long time!,"I picked up this book at the bookstore thinking it was another of those ""chef teams up with Julia"" things. As I read the blurb on the cover I was immediately intrigued so I bought it. I read the entire book in 2 days and LOVED it! I felt like Julie was me, or I am Julie. She has so many of my own issues and she is honest and unapolagetic about herself. Someone earlier was offended by the Republican bashing--so what? Get over it. I have the same copy of MtAoFC and I referred to it as she talked about the recipes. I have to agree that aspic is pretty nasty! But it had to be made to accomplish the goal. Long review short--I absolutely adored the book and am looking forward to anything else written by Julie Powell!!Jennifer Alamdari"
2,Julie and Julia,"I desperately tried to like this book - in fact, when it arrived from Amazon (used - thank goodness), I couldn't wait until my baby was asleep to jump into bed to start reading it. However, after picking away at Julie and Julia for three nights, I finally had to put it away for good. I found it tedious and rather uninteresting, focusing more on the writer's unappealing life & friends than on cooking. Nice attempt, but overrated and a disappointment."
2,Now I Understand,Now I understand why Julia Child had nothing personally to do with Julie Powell's project. I began reading this afternoon. I stopped 25% of the way through. I did not want to waste any more of my time. Julia Child had class. Julie Powell does not.The language the author uses ruins any enjoyment of descriptions of the dishes. Any reference to Julia Child is a lame attempt at transfer.
2,There is a marketing problem here......,"I think in general this book attracts ""foodies"" when they hear of the ""project"" or if they picked it up in a bookstore and flipped through the jacket. And my wife got it for me for xmas because she knows I love to cook and figured I would like this.The fact is that it should not be marketed to foodies and in general foodies will not like this book. It obviously has significant amount of text devoted to cooking but it is not the majority - the majority is devoted to the unlikeable Julie and her generally unlikeable friends. I think the biggest challenge here is that one gets no sense that Julie likes cooking or food in general - and is engaged in this project for reasons wholly unrelated to food/cooking.So for me a huge disappointment- and for other foodies - you can skip it.Lastly I was very surprised to find out the author was from Texas. I would have guessed New Jersey or Long Island."
1,"I skimmed through this book, but finally closed it for good when","she compared trussed chickens to sex crime victims. I mean really, I suppose that's an attempt at humor, but I still found it offensive. Do yourself a favor, skip the book and spend some time reading the 1 and 2 star ratings here. They are more entertaining and better written than anything Ms. Powell has put together."
1,Stinks like bad fish!,"The author is annoying and I couldn't finish the book. However this influenced me to rush out and get ""My Life in France"" and ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking."" I also have ""Appetite for Life"" which is Julia Child's biography. READ My Life in France. It is Julia Child's voice, and warm and wonderful.I am disappointed because I really wanted to like this book, since I love Julia Child....since Nora Ephron is doing the screenplay for the film, maybe it will be worth it.I can't imagine Nora even liking this girl Julie. Let's hope the movie is a good one...Meryl Streep and Stanley Tucci....with actors like that, I have hope.I gave Ms Powell the one star because she pushed me to go out and get the other books, and those I love. So I thank her for that."
1,"I've read one third of the book, and then dumped it.","I liked the idea of the book's basis; that is, blogging about learning French cooking by using Julia Child's book about French cooking. But I couldn't stand the author's personality style as it came through in her writing. It's not so much that she uses the F-word a great deal, but the fact that she is a whiney, crybaby, mean-spirited person. I feel sorry for her husband for having to put up with her histrionics. My copy is the paperback of 300 pages, and after having read the first 100 pages I cannot take any more of her. I've never felt this way about a book before, but it makes me angry. Sorry."
2,The movie has to be better than this,"I am about half way through this book. I expected to love it, but don't and cannot decide whether to keep on or dump it. A few days later.......... Ok, I did finish it and it never got better. In fact, it got worse. Julie goes on and on about her friends, spends most of her time drunk, lives in an apt that should be condemmed and is NEVER cleaned, then is shocked when she ends up with maggots, yes MAGGOTS, in her kitchen. Please don't bother with this book. Can't believe I did."
2,Disappointed!,"I was expecting more about Julie's experiences making and eating the recipes of Julia. What I got was a disjointed and profanity laden book which had little to do with Julia's recipes. Not being a prude by any means, I enjoy profane humor - if done with style however Julie seemed to use profanity more for the shock value. Over all the book was disappointing and since I don't like to waste time it won't get finished. On to the used book store!"
5,Fantastic Book!,"I actually read the book before seeing the movie and although the movie was great (I will always love Meryl Streep)the book was much better! It's rare for me to make it through a nonfiction book without being bored to tears but Julie's book was so funny and emotional I couldn't put it down. Definitely read the book before seeing the movie, a lot of the best parts were left out (so as not to offend the uptight viewers out there and apparently there are quite a few based on the other reviews I just read!) Thank you Julie Powell, my fellow Buffy fan, for writing a book that made me laugh out loud many times."
2,"Disappointing at Best, Offensive at Worst","The movie was great, and I'm amazed that anyone read this book and turned it into workable movie material. While some material is funny, her excessive use of profanity is not clever, and her political opinions are unnecessary. I thought it would be a humorous book about cooking adventures instead of an adventure through neuroses.By the way, on behalf of all conservatives, thank you for letting us know how much you hate us and for alienating me as your reader. I'm not even a Republican, but rather a Libertarian, which I am sure makes me even more greedy and uncompassionate in your eyes, but your outspoken disgust of all conservatives makes it easy for me to not waste money on any of your other literary endeavors.Now, go apologize to someone for the money you've made."
2,"For once, the movie was better.","I purchased this book after seeing, and truly enjoying, the movie. Unfortunately, my favorite elements of the movie were completely absent from the book. I did enjoy thinking about preparing many of the dishes from MtaoFC as I read, but I continually missed the movie's lovely connections to Julia Child's history and her development as a chef, writer, and teacher.In reflection, it seems to me that Julie Powell fell into a project that captured the imagination of many, and which had a profound impact on her own life. That project, however, did not make her a good writer or an inspiring person. The screenplay writers, on the other hand, accomplished both these goals and made me want to buy Julia Child's MtaoFC, read more about her biography, and cook for my friends and family.Julia captured my interest; Julie, not so much."
2,"Narcissistic Hipsters Should Cook, Not Write","After seeing the movie, I knew what I was in for when I read the book. Julia Child is a survivor, a truly original pioneer of the old school, disciplined and humble. She is everything that hipster bloggers, like the author, is not - whiny, narcissistic, entitled, yet full of illusions of her own grandeur and hero-worshipping of everything ""vintage"" and iconic - in this case it's Julia Child. I wasn't surprised Child responded the way she did - who would want to be used as a marketing gimmick and turned into a cultural totem object by a wimpy, girl-woman who has the life experience of an ameoba? Julia Child must have sensed this and stayed away."
1,"""Taste""-less","Poor Julia Child, she deserved a better tribute. Powell is just profane. It isn't the potty mouth so much - just, ick, the joyless, self-referencing, cynical, bedhopping, person-trashing, mother-blaming, aren't-I-funny New Yorkishness of it all. Julia Child was encouraging and uplifting and full of fun. Julie seems to be the antithesis, and it sucks the appreciation from the whole project. Hope the movie is way better."
1,Meanspirited woman,"The writing was okayish... But these details from the novel really turned me against the writer. A woman who laments that her life is not like her friends because she's (gasp) married and not having wild sex with all sorts of men and woman, states she loves her husband like a pig loves shot, complains (repeatedly) that she's a failed actress turned secretary when she admits she never attempted acting really speak to a woman who is very immature. Another example- she accidentally drops a very nice dessert before coming into her office. She places the dessert in the breakroom with a sign stating help yourself and then proceeds to tell those people who she knows to share her political ideology that the dessert might contain glass shards and antifreeze."
2,Leave out the swearing please!!!!!,"This book would have been ten times better (and half as long) if she had stuck to her cooking experiences. I could completely do without her foul mouth and her completely unrelated rantings about politics and sex. This book had great potential, but doesn't deliver. I fervently hope the movie version takes out the garbage and only keeps the good stuff."
1,waste of time and money,"A book as messy and nasty as some of the authors unsuccessful attempts at Julia Child's recipes. Is there anyone so self absorbed as ""Julie"", so mean and abusive to her husband and coworkers, she would actually feed a left over desert possibly contaminated with shards of glass and antifreeze to coworkers. You actually come to despise Julie and wish the butter ladden recipes would clog her arteries!"
2,disappointing,"I love both cooking and reading blogs, so I thought this book would be a natural fit for me. Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy much about it. The writing is so-so, and the author's ""deep thoughts"" that come from her cooking experiences are pretty banal and predictable.I did get a laugh that there are book club questions included at the end - I can't imagine that any book club would select this book - there is just not a lot of substance here. I'd give this one a miss."
1,"Great movie, not so great book","Well, this was quick. I usually read to page 100 before stopping, but frankly, I have so many books in my TBR pile, I am getting pickier. I can see where this book might be a fun movie to attend, but as for reading, I found Julie an unbearable character, with no depth, another gen-xer. The writing was easy reader 101 and I was just bored. I don't want to be bored, I want a book to grab me and not let go, I want to forget that my bottom is sore from sitting too long. I want to forget that it is 2 am. This book would never do that. So, I put it down at page 63.I do, however think this will be a fun movie to see and plan on doing just that!"
1,SEE THE MOVIE. SKIP THIS BOOK.,"I won't even go into detail. Suffice to say this book is written by a so called "" writer"". The book is poorly written as is but to top it off the author is a self absorbed, negative, whiny, humorless and thoughtless woman. I am an upbeat person and felt depression settling in as I was reading it. Juia Child has class.......... read her story. If you feel the need to read JULIE&JULIA don't waste a cent, get it from the library."
4,Funny Easy Read,"Look, if you are looking for action and romance you won't find it here. This book is more like a memoir about life and cooking. I thought it was enjoyable. I thought the writing was fluid, comical, and real.Its a good look into the mind of a liberal 30 year old women who has no kids, lives in New York, works for the government, and wonders what the hell happened to her life. In order to tunnel through her confusion and emotions she cooks her way thru ""The art of French cooking"".If you aren't a free thinker, and don't like cooking this book will probably tick you off and bore you. Seeing how I like food and tree huggers I thought it wasGrrreat!Good book, fun read."
4,Cute and funny!,"I just finished this book - I received it as a birthday gift from my sister in law who knows I love to peruse through vintage cookbooks in search of interesting dishes to try out. I have to admire people like Julie, who actually make a project out of an obsession! Unlike some other reviewers here, I enjoyed reading about her miserable and boring life outside the project. Her candor and humor about it is what makes this book interesting. If it were JUST about how to make each dish, where would the human interest be? If anything, there was TOO MUCH about the gross aspects of food prep for me! I hardly thought she used the F-word THAT much. And I never use it myself, and don't really care for the overuse of it (""Six Feet Under"" now, great show, but THEY use it wayyyy too much). Also, yes, the Republican / Democrat rivalry, funny at first, got to be tiring by the end (and I'm neither party). But on the whole, a good fluffy read when you don't want something too deep!"
1,Pure Dreck...,"Insufferable. F-bombs, profanity and vulgarity spices this piece of dreck about a whiny, non-stop kvetching excuse in a pseudo-literary exercise. Is it any wonder Mrs. Childs wanted nothing to do with this. This is about the author, her trials and tribulations blogged. It is NOT about the wonderful Julia Childs. If you loved the movie, DON'T read this book. You got a sense of the author in the movie, and thankfully only that. She rode Julia's apron strings to hopefully, only 15 minutes of fame. Nothing further redeemable."
2,Better as a Blog,"The premise had promise. The execution was shallow, narcissistic, and naive. In short, it brandished every hallmark of the blog it once was.But, let me be clear: I actually would have loved it as a blog. From a book, I craved more thoughtful prose and structural and thematic sophistication."
1,Who Cares?,"I bought this book at full price at the local bookstore because I couldn't wait to read it. I am a long time fan of Julia Child and have used her cookbooks for years. Reading her books as one would a novel, I learned a great deal about cooking and ingredients in my early 20's.I am so disappointed. I find it impossible to read further about this woman's life (Ms. Powell's). It is a rambling story about her life with only a sprinkling of Ms. Child. The author is a 20 or 30-something living in New York with a rather mundane and unsatisfying existence. I feel she peddled her story on Ms. Child's good reputation and life; and, in turn, did a huge diservice to Ms. Child. Shame on Ms. Powell.But, at least she got out of her lousy secretary job...with our money."
1,Boring - and overrated,"I think my title pretty much sums it up. The author's writing style isn't great - she stumbles over her words here and there. And there's not enough information about the recipes or even what she cooked in a general sense. I've just spent ten pages on stuff cooked in aspic! And the bits that are meant to be Julia's diary are plain weird - I'm completely skipping them, and can't wait to get to the end of the book.Massively overrated, I'm afraid."
2,"Wasn't horrible, but still a let down","I love to cook, and I'm also almost 30, so when I picked this book up at a bookstore at Grand Central Station a couple of months back, I was excited to read it. I read the first chapter and wasn't impressed, so I didn't come back to it for months, until I finally broke down and finished it last weekend amongst laundry loads.Like the other reviewers, I found the book to be very little about cooking, and more about a rather immature perspective on what seems to be a life with little to complain about. I didn't get the impression that Julie even LIKED to cook, so that kinda bothered me, since I thought it would be more of a celebration. She frankly struck me as someone with too much time on her hands who took on the ""Project"" merely for something to do.It was ok, and an easy read, but very self-indulgent and precocious."
2,A big disappointment!!!,"After seeing the film, I looked forward to reading the book it was based on. I loved the movie! Unfortunately, I can't say the same about the book. Usually, the book is better than the movie, but not in this case.I don't know how Powell was able to get this thing published, except that it was a novelty at the time. The writing is poor, and rambles on about nothing in particular. Not to mention the fact that her use of vulgarity is unnecessary and used way too often to suit any reader. Unlike the movie, the books dosen't go into the preparation of meals and the humor in preparing them. The only light present were the excerpts from Julia Child's life.All I can say in closing is stick with the movie. If you like the movie, don't read the book."
1,Just a 1/2 star book really,Luckily I didn't pay full price...but even at a couple dollars in the used section...I overpaid. I honestly don't know how this woman has any friends..or a nice husband.It took me quite a while to finish as I had to keep putting it down and walking away from it. I found most of it very annoying. But...I finished and then threw it in the trash. I've purchased a few other books that met that fate...and this was just another one that truly belonged there.If you really wish to torture yourself...go to a garage sale or used book store and buy it. Don't pay more than $1...as it's hardly worth that. You also may wish to drink as heavily as she does while reading. It might help.Can it be this easy to get published?
3,Cooking Dangerously,"""Julie and Julia"" recounts the story of a blogger's adventures through Julia Child'sMastering the Art of French Cooking, Vol. 1Julia Child and Julie Powell are incredible contrasts. Julia Child was a spy, she somehow managed to get into French cooking, and as a woman, succeeded in having her own cooking show. On the other hand, Julie Powell is whiny, self-centered, and callous. She gleefully serves a cake that might be filled with antifreeze and glass shards. The premise of the memoir is interesting- following Julia's Mastering Art of the French Cooking, making every single recipe. There are some comic misadventures.The book gets 3 stars instead of 2 simply because of Julia Child and the occasional discussion of the recipes. Otherwise, it's nothing like the movie with the cheerful Amy Adams and the luminous Meryl Streep. This book would've been better if it had been centered on the recipes&the; cooking, rather than Julie's self-centered, self-righteous gossip."
3,Interesting premise couldn't overcome irritating narrator,"I was surprised by this memoir/homage which I thought would be much more heavily food focused than it was. Obviously food (or its preparation) was the common tie between Julie and Julia, but the book is much more about Julia's quest to find herself through the admittedly odd project to cook her way through Julia Child's cookbook. The book is well-written though I often found myself frustrated with the author who seemed very immature in parts.All in all a decent read for someone who was never exposed to the blog that sparked the novel. I wish I had found the author more sympathetic but as it was, my irritation with her colored my enjoyment of the book. 3 stars."
1,Offensive,"I stopped reading after 40 pages. I expected this to be light and enjoyable, but the language was offensive, and I don't just mean the f word."
1,I feel bad for her husband!,"For reasons unknown, Julie Powell embarks on a year long journey of cooking every recipe from Mastering the Art of French Cooking. At the end of that year, there is no growth, maturity, desire to become a chef....nothing redeeming. Julie is now just psyched that she got a book deal. I found this book very difficult to enjoy. I kept thinking how awful her husband must have felt when he read this, as she speaks so terribly about him. Read 'My Life in France' by Julia Child instead. It's a real contribution to the literary world from someone who earned and deserved her book deal."
1,Narcissistic Blather,"What a self-involved twit the author is. She catalogs her drunken stupidity and her friends' adultery while pretending cooking Julia Child's recipes is her ""raison d'etre."" The book is full of self celebratory information and demeans the poor author's husband and his seemingly unending patience. What a lucky break Ms. Powell has had, Too bad it is undeserved, if this book is evidence of her worthiness of fame."
1,Bad book.... Bad Movie,"I don't get it... What did Julie do that was so amazing? Write a blog? I read the biography of Julia Child years ago, my wife and mother used her book for cooking as well as studied in France.The movie would have had been much better without Julie, it seems like a strange twisted obsession on Julie's part, a means to create publicity and make money.I would not recommend the book nor movie."
1,Deeply Disappointed in the book!,"Sad to say I was deeply disappointed in Julie Powell's book, ""Julie & Julia."" After attending the theatre on two different occasions to see the movie, the movie left me with an appetite to buy the book. Unfortunately, Julie Powell chose to pepper the book with an infinite number of vulgarness including the ""f"" word countless times.As a writer myself, I know characters, plot, and a great story can be crafted without the constant use of profanity. I chose not to even finish the book due to the enormous amount of offensive use of profanity. Many other good books await my time and energy to explore.I regret having purchased the book. Next time, I'll stick to borrowing at the library."
2,"Love Julia, not Julie","I really thought I would LOVE this book, but Julie Powell's attitude towards 9-11 victim families and the people pouring out their hearts with ideas for a memorial made me sick. It is the typical liberal elitist attitude toward people she considers the ""unsophisticated"" or the so-called ""great unwashed"" that really could have been left out of this book. Also the nasty attitude towards co-workers who were Republican (I mean who cares?) feeding them dessert you dropped on the street with possible shards of glass? Really? I thought compassionate was the mantra, all I saw was ugly. Not suprised Julia didn't like this blog, also glad I bought this book used so no profits went to the author-I'm sure she wouldn't want any of my blue-collar money anyway."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK,What does flithy language and sex have to do with French cooking? I thought this would be an interesting book about cooking. French food is to be respected. Julie Powell has no class. The book has many references about sex. She is immature and very disrespectful to Julia Child. I wish I could give this book away but I purchased the Kindle version. Please don't buy this book. If you want to be inspired about French cooking buy a cookbook.
2,Horrible Recipes Made Bearable,"As I'm more than halfway through this book I might as well finish. Julie's less than amusing encounters with lobster slaughter, for example, are rendered with just enough humor to make her tales palatable. I'd forgotten how unbelievably disgusting a great many of Julia's Child's recipes were until slogging my way through the diary version of Julie's life with Julia from hoof to flailing claw to beaten lettuce. A slight exaggeration, but not by much.Proof that the human species hasn't advanced all that far on a culinary level, if we're supposed to be amused by all this."
2,Don't waste your money,"Please don't waste your time or money purchasing this book. Our book club decided to read it based on it's ""good"" reviews. Only one person out of six finished it (just to get it done). The language is foul and the story is boring and drags on, which makes it difficult to follow and finish. Two stars is being generous."
1,Julie Powell could never walk in Julia Child's shoes,"The movie Julie & Julia was charming, really teaching me to love Julia Child's cooking and her hard work. This book, and Julie Powell, however, are a waste of time. The script for the movie takes huge leaps to improve her and make her likable. What's more, take five minutes to read her blog and you will see she is a prejudiced, mean spirited, selfish kind of gal. Her temper tantrums in the movie are fully representative of her true self. She curses like a sailor, despises people who dont agree with her, and is NOT the gal represented in the movie. She should take a job ministering to others, then maybe she could learn to write (and live)."
3,Nice writing style but mixed subject matter,"I did things backwards: I first had the cookbook; later on watched the movie; then bought a used copy of this book. I struggle with the cookbook in that I am not a great cook; I thought the movie was cute; I am have mixed feelings about the book.I do think the author has a nice, quirky, rather engaging writing style that I enjoyed--for the most part. Like many, however, I was uncomfortable with all the graphic sex talk, revealing friends and husband's secrets, and a rather whiny tone of voice. I would rather the author concentrate on developing her earthy writing skills and leave out the trash."
2,Developed my interest in Julia Child,"I read this book because I saw the film which I loved. I was also interested because I thought the book would be a lot like the film and both characters would be represented as in the film. It wasn't. Julia was barely in the book at all. At last I gave up and only read half of it. The one good thing about it is, it encouraged me to buy the book Julia Child: My Life in France, which I really liked.The book is all about Julie and her friends with some writing now and then about preparing food that sounds very unappetizing. There is little about the Julia part of the story. In fact, nothing about the book seem to make much sense to me. It's all about life with Julie, which most of the time is very confusing and often unpleasant. I didn't understand the comments which found the book ""laugh out loud"" ""very funny"" or a ""marvel"". I just found them boring and tedious. But the movie was very good, totally different and quite a lot of fun."
2,Running out of gas,"I just don't know if I can make it to the end with this one. I feel like I've struggled with myself to get to the 3rd chapter, which is where I'm at tonight. It's just..whats the best word to describe it... narcissistic.. I wish I read the reviews before I bought this book."
1,Struggle to get half way through,I expected the book to be more charming focusing on trials/triumphs of food and disappointed didn't at leastoffer up a few recipes. I went to the halfway point thinking it was going to get better but skimmed ahead thenabandoned it altogether. I would agree with most of the other reviewsthat this is very disappointing and focused too much on sex antidotes of everyone in the book--it was embarrassing.And the constant vulgar language was overbearing. See the movie-skip the book.
1,One thing Julie DIDN'T learn from Julia: class.,"I have to agree with the one-star reviews and join the folks who just couldn't make it past the self-absorbtion, whines, and pointless vulgarity. I gave up at page 45. What kind of foodie makes comments like ""I never eat carrots"" and ""then we got the eggs?"" After all her research on and idolization of Julia, Julie still doesn't understand what it means to have true class. She's just another foul-mouthed blogger."
1,Not For Me,I saw the movie first and it ruined the book for me. (usually the other way around) My advice is to see the movie! Too much of the F-word and yucky detail of peoples sex lives. I did not finish the book.
1,"Ick, Ick, Ick","My book club is reading this book. A friend loved it and said it was a quick easy read. I hate it, hate it, hate it and have from the first few pages. The main character is boring, profane (for no apparent reason except lack of class) and whines about everything. The only thing I've enjoyed is the tiny bit about Austin, where I grew up. I adored Julia Child who was one of a kind. The author should be ashamed using her singular greatness to make money with this crass garbage."
4,"It's a memoir, folks","I felt compelled to write a review of this book for two reasons: I really loved reading it, and I want to balance some of the negative reviews. It's okay if you don't like something, of course it is. But to criticize a memoir for being a memoir, having too much information, not appealing to a broad enough audience, etc., seems wrong-headed. This book is exactly what it says it is: a woman, lost at nearly thirty, commits to cooking all of Mastering in a year, and lives to tell about it. Julie Powell is not a cook, not a chef: she's a person, and she found inspiration in Julia Child. Simple as that. That it didn't fit ""foodies"" image of what a book like that should look like is immaterial.Lastly, anyone who loves David Straitharn is a friend of mine. Go, get it. You'll probably love it, especially if you don't think you're a fantastic cook."
2,"Skip over Julie, grab Julia","This book dragged on. Julie is incredibly whiny, and it seemed every other page she was ready to give up her project. Please, do! If you want a truly delicious memoir, read Julia Child's ""My Life in France,"" David Lebovitz's ""Sweet Life in Paris,"" or Ruth Reichl's ""Tender at the Bone."""
5,Laugh out loud fun!,"Julie & Julia is a really funny, fun light read that's engaging from first page to last. The type of book that's great to escape into... grabs you from the beginning and leaves you smiling at the end.Julie is easy to recognize (she's a little bit of all of us) and her adventure into French culinary cooking is hysterical. I'm now looking forward to seeing how they capture the essence of this charming book on screen.The only bad part about this book is I kept getting hungry! Will now have to dig up some Julia Childs cook books and whip up a few treats (and laughs, I'm sure) of my own."
4,I thought it was funny!,"Yes, Julie whines, but it's because her life is at a standstill! Who hasn't been in a situation in life where things get stagnant? I agree that the way she wrote about 9/11 was a little insensitive - it was cringe-worthy. But, c'mon, anyone who dares to plow their way through a cookbook such as this one, probably the best ever written, has to get some kudos! I have to admit that while reading the segment with the maggots had me laughing 'til I was crying. My only hope is that the movie doesn't make Julia Child look foolish. I hope she is portrayed as the smart, talented, remarkable woman she was. My only regret is that I didn't stand in line at the bookstore when Julia was signing copies of her last book. My loss. I want Julie Powell to keep writing."
2,"Nice idea for a book, terrible writing","I am an enthusiastic amateur cook, who also loves to read. However, having grown up in US I admit I never heard of Julia Child until I married and moved here (my mother-in-law is a big fan). I thought the basis for the book to be a very clever idea, and I can see how it would be an interesting blog. Unfortunately, rather early on in the book, I found the writing to be of a rather humdrum quality. There were flashes of good writing, but they were too few and far between to sustain interest. I struggled as much as I could, but I couldn't finish it. This is the quality of writing that makes me think anyone can get a book deal - maybe even me!"
1,Self Indulgent Drivel,"I thought the book was going to be a fun to read chronicle of a the author's cooking experiment. Wrong. She describes selling her eggs like someone else might describe holding a garage sale to raise a few extra bucks. When she described a very disturbing scene that involved a deranged woman deliberately and publically bashing her head into the concrete, and then managed to turn it into a self indulgent pity party for herself without skipping a beat, I closed the book and took it back to the library."
2,A very disappointing book...,"I had high hopes when first picking up this book. I had seen it before on the shelves, before the movie previews started on TV, but I passed it up. After seeing how cute the movie looked and seeing it was a film by Nora Ephron, the woman behind the great films Sleepless in Seattle and You've Got Mail, then I decided to give it a try. I started to read the book, got into it, maybe 50 pages in thinking, ""This is cute, I think I'm going to like this."" I then started reading further into it and was very disappointed. Not only was it very long and boring, but the author has the tendency to not translate the meaning of what she's cooking, since all of the recipes have French names. Bless you if you can get through this book. I am an avid reader and usually will read almost anything but this wasn't something I could. Watch out for another book she has coming out in December called 'Cleaving', a more detailed of the same story told in this book."
2,Slow service!!!!!!,It took almost a month to get the book and it was not quite what I expected. I was hoping for a fun book to read and its borderline boring!!
3,"Tasty, in a fast food way","I was really looking forward to enjoying this piece of light fiction and am disappointed. While it's not the worst book I've ever read, I am growing tired of Julie Powell and friends excessive drinking, vulgar language, and her need to bash Republicans about every 15 pages. The book is clever, but not particularly well written and I can only surmise that she is getting rave reviews from the mainstream media on the basis of her hatred of conservatives. For example, in one chapter someone asks if she's a Republican and she exclaims, no, Republicans don't wear vintage. Seriously? She might want to get out more and get that ugly chip off of her shoulder. And by the way, if you love animals, this is not the book for you anyway."
5,Julie and Julia,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Julie's voice is clear and her message of her life opening up by taking on a daunting, but exhilarating task - and thereby, gaining joie de vivre - is delightful!"
1,So Dissapointed,"I was looking forward to reading this book since I have always loved Julia Child and love to Cook. How dare this Woman use Julia Child to promote her hatred towards our President of the United States and the Republican party! I honestly tried to overlook her constant bashing of Republican but when I got to page 191 where she insulted more then half of America by calling Republicans ""Pure Evil"". I took that personally since I am a Republican and did this Author realise she just insulted over 50% of the population who voted in the last election for President Bush? I guess she didn't care. I've decided to throw this woman's book away, actually I think I will take great pleasure in ripping it up into a million pieces then burn it."
2,Not what I expected,"I thought this was a pretty bitter screed that was more about her life and self-absorbed (as well as self-indulgent) negativity than Julia Child or food. I was also embarrassed for this woman's husband, whose dirty laundry was aired in a book ostensibly about cooking. I was really disappointed with the whining."
1,Hated this book! Don't bother - it's horrible,"This book is not at all about cooking or Julia Child. This Julie Powell loves to swear which I find very offensive. I couldn't read more than a chapter before I threw the book away. Not worth donating, I wouldn't want anyone else to read this book. It's too bad that she made some money from the sale of this book. I bet that most of the people that bought this book would take a refund if they could. Terrible book, don't waste your time or intellect. If you want a fabulous book, read My life in France, by Julia Child. Any excellent read."
1,Was the language necessary?,I agree with those who said the profanity and confusing writing led them to stop reading. I could not make myself keep reading this book. I hope the movie is better...I thought the book was terrible.
3,"Good, but could have been better.","I love to cook and I love to read, so I was hoping that this book would be, well, more than what it was. I rate it 3.5 out of 5 stars because there were admittedly many insightful moments, as well as many funny ones. Unfortunately, there was also a lot of ""filler"" material, comprised of random, pointless stories about her friends and too many asides regarding her political views. This just got to be a bit frustrating because this is a memoir of a cooking project, not a social or political commentary."
2,Julie & Julia,Not the greatest book I've ever read. It arrived in good time and in excellent condition.
2,"tasteless book, left me with a craving for less","The worst part of this book is that it's just boring. It's also crass and unsubtle, and at no time was I persuaded that the author actually enjoys food. It's interesting that Julie Powell got a book deal out of her experiment, but I can't imagine why. Paid five bucks for it at Barnes & Noble. Couldn't finish it."
1,Julie IS Truly Offensive in her writing!Not for those under 18!,"I was so excited to read a book by someone whom had accomplished such a tome~Chef Julia Child's co~authored and written for Americans, :Mastering the Art of French Cooking,Volume I.Then, as I began to ""get"" involved in the story line, shocked. Julie could not complete ONE PAGE without Profanity.Why? I have made many ""prat~falls"" in the Kitchen and extreme profanity did not make me feel better!I returned my barely read copy for my money back! I'd rather have Volumes I &II of ""French Cooking"" that cost LESS and are True Poetry.Julie, Yes You made ""skads"" of money and ""happy for ya, yet, honestly, would not want to be ya."" {I did get my copies of both voloumes through my book club.}Also, rely on Amazon and other well established web sites I trust."
2,Self-indulgent,"The author has a good sense of humor so there are many funny moments, but in general, there isn't a lot of substance here. Definitely don't pay full price for this one!"
4,fun book,"i really enjoyed this book, so much so that i bought it for other friends interested in food and such. if you like people writing like they talk, being honest about their lives, and being pretty funny then you might like this book."
4,"Haven't seen the movie, but enjoyed the book!","The book was recommended to me before the movie was announced. I purchased it at an independent bookstore, and didn't read it for several years. When I finally got around to it . . . well, all I can say is that I was fairly entertained. I can't imagine why anyone would actually WANT to cook that much! But I was entertained, if a little grossed out, by the story. I haven't been able to eat lobster since, and have eaten very little chicken. But I did go out and buy a lot of butter, and cooked with it more often. I don't know what that says -- all those recipes, and the thing that appealed to me was cooking with butter . . . maybe I am just not attracted to French cooking . . .I think I'll skip the movie."
1,One Sentence Plot Summary,"Here is the plot summary of the entire book:A foul-mouthed, foul-minded, narcissistic, whining American secretary/wife spends one year on French cooking.The only redeeming points of the book are the occasional interesting metaphor and some information on Julia Child.Please do not waste your time on this book (and on a different note, add tons of butter to...or ladle over...any dish you make and it will instantly become a ""French"" dish. That is the grand secret to French cooking. French dining calls for a large tub of butter on the table next to the French dish.)"
3,From Blog to Page to Plate,"The latest thing in nonfiction seems to be narrative tales of projects -- Reading through the encyclopedia, climbing Mt. Everest, cooking your way through Julia Child's ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking."" Whatever you dream up, chances are someone's already done it -- and written a blog about it. Here, Julie Powell, a hapless 20-something secretary in NYC, looks for -- and finds -- meaning amidst the pages of the first volume of Childs' tome. An entertaining read, but I get the feeling the actual blog was more entertaining the first time around."
2,Not worth the hype,"I picked this up because I heard about it endlessly on NPR and trusted them to direct me to a great book. I was sadly disappointed. Julie Powell tried to tie together a series of disparate blogs into a meaningful and humorous account of a year but didn't succeed very well; I felt like I was bouncing from one story to another to another without any strong connections between them and, unfortunately, there wasn't much humor or well-rounded characters to make up for it (Julie, the one fully fleshed character, was more annoying that sympathetic). I don't recommend this at all. Believe it or not, I'm sure the movie will be better."
3,Crudness spoils the fun....,"I can't recommend this book to others that would be offended by the crude language....my advice to the author is become more articulate.While diverting, and somewhat entertaining, this book makes me cringe too often."
2,Sliver tongued author,The idea and the book was a great. I found her gutter language was totally unnecessary. There are so many beautiful words in the English language. Too bad she does not use them.
3,Know what you're getting,"Like many other readers, I thought this book was going to be about food. I don't do Julia Child-style gourmet cooking; it frustrates me more often than not, but I do like a good bit of food writing and this is not it. It's a memoir of sorts and a vent for the writer's self-absorbed angst. Not that most people don't have similar moments, but most people don't write about them either. The pettish slaps at Republicans(otherwise kind, intelligent people who still vote Republican? please) get old after about three such intervals and the frank discussion of friends' sex lives as well as her own-well, it's just not what I was looking for."
2,"Great idea, uncontrolled vocabulary","I was very excited to read Julie and Julia as I am a fan of French cooking and Julia Child but after a couple of chapters Julie Powell's profanity was almost unbearable. I did finish the book but I don't recommend it to anyone without first telling them she has the worst potty mouth I've seen in awhile. The movie was much, much better."
2,Not enough food,"I had heard about this book and the author's blog, so when I ran across it in the ""bargin books"" section I was excited to get such a deal on a book! In hindsight, the low cost should have been an indication about the quality of the writing, as the book was not really worth the $4,99 I spent! I was expecting a fun book focusing on her project, the challenges with cooking and other adventures that she had while cooking her way through a great cookbook, but I was sorely disappointed. The author went on and on about her personal life, her job at a government agency and her relationships with friends and family. It is more like a diary of the author's life with the cooking project being a side-note. I really would have enjoyed this book more if she simply wrote about the recipes and her experiences with them, than her life in general."
2,Waste of time and money!,"This book has very little to do with cooking or the amazing Julia Childs. It is more an account of Ms. Powell's chaotic and unremarkable life. References to Julia and Paul Childs are sparse and oddly placed. Time spent chronicling work in the kitchen (which was fairly interesting) was vastly overshadowed by incoherent rants about family and friends. Attempts at wit were forced and not particularly funny. I generally smile at chiding by opposing political parties; however, I found Ms. Powell's persistent irreverent generalization of Republicans as unemotional and ""piggy"" annoying. I was particularly troubled after reading the cold account of her job consoling families a year post 9/11 as ""emotional sh** work"". WOW - I'd rather blow my nose on my t-shirt than have this woman hand me a tissue! I feel a little defeated but will be closing this book for good on page 99. I reccommend checking this out at the library and saving the hard-earned $25."
2,Total Waste,"I was looking forward to this book and, as I was reading it, became increasingly disgusted. Ms. Child was bright, exuberant, gracious, and courageous. Her marriage and friendships were positive and loving. All in all, even apart from her influence on cooking/eating, she was a worthwhile person in every respect.Ms. Powell is a self-indulgent, whiny, neurotic and colossally boring brat. She treats little annoyances like world disasters, she is a miserable spouse and friend, and she revels in her self-indulgent immaturity. For her to exploit the life/name of Ms. Child is a travesty and it is a shame that she made a dime doing it.I immediately re-read the wonderful ""Appetite for Life"" after wading through Ms. Powell's dreck and nothing could have more clearly emphasized what an utter waste Ms. Powell's book was. She expressed dismay that Ms. Child was negative about her blog--my guess is that Ms. Child would have been understandably disgusted with Ms. Powell whatever her topic."
1,"Great Idea, Poor Execution","In a nutshell, this book stinks. It's more about the trials and tribs of a 30-year-old in a dead-end job in New York than it is about Julia Child or cooking or food in general. And the whole book is larded with profanity which serves no purpose, except perhaps to bolster the author's hipster creds. But at the end of the read, where are we? Roughly the same place we started, except in need of a shower. Because of the book's great potential, I think it's fair to call the book a huge failure"
2,As weblog it was interesting and amusing.. not as a book,"I have followed her weblog for a while. it was interesting and amusing. Her weblog entries were fun to read. just day to day ramblings. She really did not care what people thought about her writing style or content. That all seems lost in the book. I can only guess that she had to please an editor and a publisher and supply more then just a journal. they wanted a bio.The weblog made her sound like a smart person with sardonic wit. One of those people you just like to hang around with, they know just how much to say without boring everyone. After reading the book I do not want to know her.. I do not think I would get a word in edgewise or I would fall asleep from boredom"
1,I've never disliked anyone so much in my life.,"This book was so much less than I had hoped for and that it could have been. I love the parts about Julia Child but why did this writer include stories about herself?! This writer's life is not only boring, it's painful to read about! This woman is pathetic. I found not one redeeming quality in Julie Powell as a person and she seemed so proud of being what I consider a self-centered, high-maintenance, elitist b_ _ _ h. Her poor husband! Poor readers! I say go directly to anything by or about Julia Child and read the real thing. Get to know Julia Child...a woman of grace, courage and talent. Everything Julie Powell is not."
1,A complete disappointment,"This book was a complete disappointment for me. I enjoyed the movie and was delighted when my book club decided to read the book. Unlike the loveable Julie from the movie, Julie Powell is self absorbed and moany. She tries far too hard to be witty and amusing and it just doesn't work. The book jumps from one subject to the next with some personal stuff thrown in about her pals who I don't really care about as they don't really add to the subject. Since reading the book I have checked out her blog and can not say that I am surprised that Julia Child did not approve. It is a great dis-service to Julia Child. I would find it insulting to have my name associated with it."
1,Dd Not Waste Your Time or Money!!!!,"I was truely looking forward to reading this book. What a disapointment! This author is a self indulgent, whinny, twit. Her discrption of the 9/11 victim's families is enough to make you hate her.I want my money back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Attitude,"When I first got this book I thought it would be a good read especially her escapades with cooking. And I liked the little tidbits about Julia Childs and her husband. However, I got tired of the book after sixty - seventy pages of it. I found I was angry and disgusted by her total lack of sympathy for those who were trying to contribute to the 911 memorial as well as the families who have lost people in towers. Her condescension was more than I could handle. She and her friends were a bunch of whining self-absorbed twenty/thirty-somethings that believe the world revolved around them and their happiness. In the end I could not bring myself to read any farther. That's too bad. It should have been better given the concept."
2,Really Hope the Movie is Better,"This book was a HARD read. I had to force myself to finish it. I did not find Julie's character to be very interesting and she had few redeeming qualities. She was flat out mean to her brother and to her husband. She was totally self centered, with ""The Project"" being the center of her world for an entire year, and thinking that she should be treated as the center of the world by everyone in her life.I certainly hope the movie is more entertaining and the characters more engaging."
2,Agree with the bad reviews,"The movie looks charming and I am looking forward to seeing it. The book is written by a very unlikable snobbish whiny young woman who turned my stomach early on in the book with her attempt at wit. I recently read The School of Essential Ingredients, which is a lovely book about cooking and the magic of a well made meal. I thought this book would have the same charm, but it did not. The only palatable parts of the book are about Julia. I'm glad I borrowed it from the library instead of buying it!"
2,Julia Instead of Therapy?,I read the entire book but it took me 2 months to complete because I couldn't get over the authors near jumps into the deep end of self loathing and constant freak outs. While amusing at first I can't help but wonder if the Julie/Julia Project was a way for her to avoid spending money on therapy.
2,Clint the Nevada's Loner/A noose is waiting for you Trinity,Too slow. I expected more action which I did not get in this double feature.
2,I gave it two for the try.,"This is my second Jack book. I read the Girl Next Door because books like this interest me and I feel, because I'm naturally good hearted, complete me. However, there were issues.1. J.K...who edited this book! This book is full of stupid typos the author should have caught. I usually put down a book after 10, give or take, but I kept reading this one because the woman had my sympathy. Misspelled words, run-on sentences, missing quotations marks, half of a repeat sentence...Was there an editor at all?2. The plot goes stale after chapter seven, is sometimes unbelievable because why isn't no one looking for a pregnant women abducted in broad daylight, and the ending leaves you confused, like was she dreaming, or what?3. The charaterization of the antagonist is, well, more horrible than the horror.I liked the theme that was played with here."
