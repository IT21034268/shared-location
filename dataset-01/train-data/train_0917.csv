3,comes appart to easily,"My girls are constantly popping the top lid off because nothing holds this hut together except itself, no glue or anything"
3,Chin-hut is just ok...,"The hut is cut and compact, but it didn't stay together very well. The pieces slide together instead of being nailed or glued. Unfortunately, my chinchilla kept pulling the pieces apart so I had to buy him something else more stable."
1,No worth the time and money,The content is kind of chaos and the book seems like a graduate student project
5,Review from a 6-year old,"This is a very good book because it is also placed around the time of WWII. It is about one person and it is not an `I' book, meaning it is not written in first person. Rufus M. is special because he has many odd friends including a cardboard boy, a soldier named Al and a flying horse named Jimmy. Only Al is real (meaning alive). Rufus M. is part of the Moffat family. I have read about the Moffat family previously in another book called The Moffat Museum. In this book, they have already moved from their original little yellow house to Cranberry. Rufus M. tried to be a ventriloquist and a wizard. I think it is very funny when he tried to perform a knife trick by using a rubber knife to plunge into himself!"
4,This legendary songwriter finally gets into the studio!,"Everyone knows Daniel as the legendary singer-songwriter who influenced the likes of Kurt Cobain (Nirvana) and Eddie Vedder (Pearl Jam). Johnston's ""homemade"" cassettes feature some of the most brilliant, intimate, and sometimes frightening songs of the last 30 years. ""Fun"", produced by Paul Leary (Butthole Surfers), offers a lighter side of Daniel. He's older, wiser and having more, well, Fun! Highlights include the rocking ""Love Wheel"", ""Life In Vain"", ""Crazy Love"", and the wonderful ""Happy Time."" Be sure to check out Daniel's orginal folk-art images on the cover and inside the liner notes. And, the ""purple duck of happiness"" is featured on the CD itself!"
4,Great Fun!,I had this book on my Amazon Wish List for Christmas. My daughter gave it to me at Thanksgiving and I could not wait for everyone to go home so I could get started. The book is very easy to follow. Directions are in plain english with lots of tips on sewing the book together. You will never look at fabric without seeing a book.
2,very limited in scope and instruction,I was so looking forward to this book and was very dispointed at how limited the instruction and detail that was provided. It simply does not provide adequate support for designing quality fabric books
5,An excellent approach to a very difficult problem,"After over 15 years of watching my mother's drinking problem worsen, my family came to the conclusion that there was nothing we could do to help her. We thought, ""How can you help someone who doesn't want help or doesn't think there is a problem?"" This book very clearly shows you that with the right approach, there is something that you can do to help your loved one get the necessary treatment required to overcome his/her addiction. Bruce Cotter uses a very clear, personal approach that everyone can understand. After reading this book, I felt empowered to help my mother into the treatment program that she desparately needs."
5,excellent book,"Bruce Cotter has written an excellent book with very practical advice for a very difficult situation: when a family member has an alcohol problem. The best advice for anyone who knows someone with an alcohol problem is to read this book. This is a great starting point. The anger, resentment, and frustration that you feel are normal but will make the problem worse. Read this book and begin to help yourself to understand alcoholism and begin the healing for you and your loved one. Bruce Cotter will empower you to feel that you can do something before it is too late."
4,"Clarity, Communication and Leadership","You may not necessarily agree that the ""four obsessions"" highlighted by the author are equivalently applicable to every case and organization, but regardless of their ranking and priority, you will be hard-pressed to argue against them: build a cohesive leadership team; create organization clarity; over-communicate; reinforce clarity through human systems.""The Four Obsessions"" is a light read and a great story - great book which serves to remind you of what to look for and what to work on in your own enterprise."
3,It was good - especially since I had to read it,"I enjoyed this book. I had to read it for class, so the fact that it was prefaced with a very enjoyable story was a HUGE plus! Since I am someone actively seeking management, I found this book to be helpful with my life goals - although it seems a little simple, I am looking forward to putting this into practice!"
5,Highly Effective Teaching Tool,So far I've given this book to 3 of my middle managers in an effort to explain to them what type of company I want to run. Every one of them has found Four Obsessions incredibly useful. I'd make it required reading for anyone in your business that needs help understanding the way a company should operate.
4,The Four Obsessions of an Extraordinary Executive: A Leadership Fable,"Great book on things you think everyone should know, but no one actually practices. Very easy read. My only problem with it is that the executive was so perfect that it was too easy to say ""I can't be this good"" so why bother."
2,Story is too contrived to be believable,"This book has some good conceptual ideas that are worth the read. Where the book falls down is in the contrived story that two leaders take to illustrate the concepts. The story is somewhat believable except for the consistent good leader bad leader contrast. The story creates a situation where a potential candidate happens to meet the good leader at the bad leaders office during an interview.The book has some good concepts, the author just needs to find another vehicle to communicate the message."
5,"Nice set, use and go","Nice handy little socket set, bought it for uninstall and install on car seats, used and happy with it, keep it with your tools, a good buy!"
4,Not Bad,Use these with a 30ft lbs air ratchet in my occupation. Sure they're no sunex but for ten bucks you can't beat it.
2,Packing problem with masks,"The masks were sufficient for my purpose AND they looked good. However, they were packaged a a box that was too small so the snouts were smashed when they arrived. They are made of plastic and I was able to push the snouts back out to where they were supposed to be but there were crinkles in the mask as a result. Please note that they are made for children so they are too big to fit most adult heads.They masks arrived within a week of placing the order."
2,Sitdown Henceforth,"Oldham is the type of artist overpraised for his bare aesthetic and rustic sensibilities, though put under the microscope this bleak, minimal, partially experimental folk often feels empty-not in the emotional context either, but in a compositional one. It is worth noting that when these few disparaging elements do fuse together in the rare effortless manner which Oldham always attempts, he does offer a distinctly weary flavor- it just feels like the contrived calibration to reach that level often sticks out."
5,SO good...,"This is a GREAT album...slept on heavily. My favorite track on the album is ""info for the streets."""
4,Powerpuffs save the day!,"""Frighty Night,"" by E.S. Mooney, is #9 in this series of Powerpuff Girls stories. The book series is based on the popular TV show ""The Powerpuff Girls,"" created by Craig McCracken.Just in case you don't know about the Girls, the book includes a transcription of the dialogue from the show's opening credits. The Girls are a trio of superheroes who also attend Pokey Oaks Kindergarten in the City of Townsville. In this book, the Girls investigate a supposedly haunted amusement park.""Frighty Night"" does a pretty good job of capturing the spirit of the show; most of the dialogue in the book actually reads like it could come from a television episode. The colorful illustrations look just like the visual style of the show. But overall, I thought the book couldn't fully reproduce the manic, zany energy of the series. I think that some characters are just harder to ""translate"" from one medium to another. Still, ""Frighty Night"" is good fun for Powerpuff fans."
3,Convenient,"Convenient little holder for that pen and paper you always need in the kitchen. The pen that comes with it is garbage - upon the first click it became stuck and wouldn't retract. I threw mine away after a brief battle with it. BUT, the holder is perfect, and just the right size for those little list pads you get (you know, the ones that come with magnetic backing that falls off halfway through the tablet) and a pen or two. Very handy."
4,Pocket organiser,"Great idea, handy accessory for fridge and easy access to small things including my spectacles. Should have ordered more though."
4,"Great box, worthless pen and pad.","I love this magnetic organizer! It's great for holding pens and notepads, is quite strong, and looks great in my kitchen. Minus one star for the crappy pen and pad, but it's still a great value if you just throw those items out. Exactly what I needed to keep writing supplies handy in the kitchen, and highly recommended!"
5,Like i got it with my fridge!,"Exactly what i set out to get, looks like it comes with my fridge. No more missing grocery items in my shopping cart."
1,Revelation Revealed by Christ II,"The return of the Christ has drastically changed all previous attempts at interpreting/decoding The Book of Revelation. I have produced the ""book/scroll"" of Rev 5:1-10:10 with the ""7 seals""/'beyond Einstein theories' on the cover (google that). For the correct revealing of this encoded mystic prophecy, you can go to: 7seals.yuku.com or RevelationRevealed.proboards.com ."
3,"Ok Mixes, But way too short",The Main problem with these Mixes is that there is no real club length remix here. But these remixes will do for this light weight fluff. Better than buying their album which was Horrid!!!
1,terrible,"I did not realize it was ""cassette"" tapes. This was embarassing as it was a gift and no one has casette players anymore. :0("
5,Stunning,This pattern is beautiful and it was very well packed. The only problem I had was it shipped very slow. It was well worth the wait!
3,Dated information . . .,"The concept of this project - interviewing successful musicians/performers for advice about gigging - in and of itself is a good idea, however, the project is very dated. The DVD release says 2003, but the copyright and the end of the program reads 1999. No disrespect intended to those interviewed, but many of the ""talking heads"" had me asking myself, ""Who is that?"" Also, several people kept talking about having a demo tape, and passing your cassette around, and having a VHS tape available - formats that are rarely used today. Only a few references were made about the Internet. This is not to say there is nothing to gain from the project. Comments about working hard and being persistent are relevant no matter what year it is. But overall the suggested technologies and performing opportunities are dated."
3,Only for Thule Bars,"I know to most of you I may be stating the obvious, but this fairing is only designed to fit Thule made racks. It states this fact at least twice in the online description, but a few reviews made me think it could be easily adaptable to other racks. I can say with absolute certainty that it will not fit a factory Volvo rack (2012 Volvo S60) without heavy modification. The Thule attachments are at least half an inch too small in diameter.It seems well made, with a clean glossy fairing that screams THULE in large white letters. However, the flat black plastic end pieces seem to cheapen it up a bit, and I would guess cause a bit of unneeded drag. Why Thule? I'd rather the glossy finish continue all the way to the edges, as it does with much of the competition. I suppose the OCD in me wanted to match a Swedish fairing with a Swedish car, but it wasn't meant to be."
2,Doesn't work well with 2008 Audi TT,"Looks cool, but my windshield wipers hit the fairing when used because the fairing extensions are too long. I may have to modify the clips or make something. Kind of a bummer. Did anyone at Thule actually test it before recommending it for this vehicle? Oh well, I just have to hope it doesn't rain when it's up there right?"
4,"Works, but expensive","It works and gets rid of the bar whistling but you still get some 'other' noise against the fairing but it's not as annoying. I don't know if this thing will actually help gain back the mpg. it's expensive for a piece of plastic. One complaint I have on the install is that getting the two middle brackets into the #2 hole is really tough. I cut myself on the fairing edge and got a pretty nasty gash. Be careful, it's very sharp."
3,An easier way to stop roof rack noise,"If you're looking to enhance the look of your roof rack (and are willing to fork out the $$), feel free to buy the Thule fairing (although make sure that you measure correctly). But if noise is your problem, try moving the bars. Better yet, before trying anything else, use a trick that a guy at local camping store told me about. Take a thin utility cord/rope. Tie it to one end of the front crossbar and wrap it repeatedly around the crossbar to the other end of the front crossbar (spaced about an inch or so per loop) where you tie it tight. Can disrupt the airflow enough to break the noise - basically got rid of all of the noise from my rack. I used a 10 foot cord which cost $1.60. Doesn't look as cool as a fairing (esp. if you're stuck with the purple cord which was all they had when I bought it), but much cheaper and no one will steal it from your car. And you don't have to move the bars so that you can't use them."
5,Go for it!,"It should be standard equipment when you buy roof racks. Before I wasn't able to drive over 55mph because of noise from racks. Now noise is GONE!!!! Completely gone - sometimes with strong side wind I hear some little whistling, but I can deal with that. You need this toy!"
5,great looking fairing,I have bought two of these one for my vehicle and one for the basket rack that goes on top of my Jeep. Easy to install and a quality product.
2,Does not fit all roof racks,"Purchased this for a 2007 Volvo XC70 that has the Volvo-branded wing profile cross bars. Even though Thule makes both the cross bars and the fairing, they don't work together. I called Thule for an adaptor and they confirmed that they don't work together. The kit has adaptors for the standard square cross bars and Thule's rounded cross bars."
4,Saab 9-3 2003,"Pros:- Easy to install provided you follow the instructions and take your time.- It looks good (way better than the rack alone).- It does cut some noise, I don't know about the mpg yet.Cons:- On my car, Saab 9-3 2003, the corners do not touch the roof of the car, not a huge deal, but still, I notice it. I assume when I hit high speeds, they do touch."
4,Works alright,Helped bring down some of the flapping and road noise but of course since I am in a soft top it will never go away completely. Fariing looks good and works ok. I am satisfied.
3,not quite what i had hoped...,"as a big badfinger fan, it was interesting to get the stories from the members, but some of the interviews are hard to understand. also, a very strange extra amount of interviews put on at the end was not a good idea."
5,Excellent Documetary of and excellent band,This video is great. It portrays a tragic story of one of rock n' rolls most overly looked bands.
2,Better than nothing.,"It was fun seeing and hearing their hits performed, but...it could have been much better. I'm not sorry that I bought it, only because there's no other option for now, and I love Badfinger."
3,Music + Tragedy revealed in the &#65533;other&#65533; band from Liverpool.,"""Day after Day"" is one of those songs that is always with you, no matter how many times you hear it, you never tire of it.. My only real knowledge of the British Group, Badfinger, is through this song. In fact, until I saw this documentary, I never realized they did ""No Matter What"", wrote the Harry Nilsson super hit, ""Without You"", or originally recorded the pop smash ""Come and Get It"", written by Paul McCartney.The documentary is rather one-dimensional, featuring video interviews with the remaining band members, and film and video snippets from past performances. It's a little amateurish, many gaps and holes, but informative--I wish the DVD packaging had more written chronology of the band and events, cast of characters and the like. But it contains great performance footage, and at 84 minutes, well worth the time.If you're a fan of the British Invasion, it's a must."
5,Great Story. Great music.,This video is a must for any one about to get in to the music business as an artist. Along with the great music and history of rock music in Britain at the time there is also a moral tale of be careful what you wish for. Well done!
2,More please,"It was great to watch the videos but not enough of them were included. The talking was too much and too boring and the music wasn't enough.It made me think more of Pete Ham and how good he was. He was in the wrong band. If he were in the Stones or any other credible rock band, he'd be a major superstar. He was in a band that fit like a pair of cement shoes. Too bad."
1,sloppy and doesn't tell the essential story,Read the book on Badfinger - Without You: The Tragic Story Of Badfinger. This is a poor production.
5,Very high quality,"I had to covert an old wedding VHS tape to a DVD and this made the video look very modern and professional. The only problem is that it can take an entire day or two to burn a good quality DVD. If you buy a nice printer and some blank dvd cases, you could make very professional DVD's and sell them. That's how good this DVD-R is."
4,Sony 120 Minute 4.7 G.......,"I've had good luck with this brand, but not so much with others. I'm not sure if I've purchased a rewritable pack from them.There's nothing worse than a DVD that seems to be okay, till editing begins, or failing to load prior to taping. This hasn't happened with Sony, yet. The quality depends on the quality of the recording. It plays well, and the discs are fairly durable, handling a few minor scratches."
4,A nice Kathy Smith workout,"I won't give a detailed breakdown since so many others have. This is three 20 minute workouts, which seems to be the trend lately towards short workouts. Kathy looks GREAT for her age. I think your opinion of this workout will depend a lot on your opinion of Kathy Smith in general. It's a nice intermediate workout with Kathy alone (no background exercisers), which I personally prefer. She includes several of her very irritating, totally annoying, whooping sounds which almost make the workout unbearable for me. Which is a shame since it is otherwise a well-balanced workout with lots of variety. So again, it all depends on your Kathy tolerance (mine varies from day to day)."
4,Great DVD when you're on a time limit,"I've used Kathy Smith DVDs since I was a teen - my mom was hooked on her when I was growing up. I loved seeing her in this DVD, looking just as fit as she did 20 years ago. This DVD is separated into three segments: Total Circuit, Total Balance and Total Energy. If you're in a pinch for time, you can pick one. If you've got an hour and want to really boost your workout, you can do all three together.I'm picky about my workout DVDs. I don't like hectic cuing or fake perma-smiles. This one was great - Kathy is mellow, encouraging and fun. There were a variety of exercises and positions, and it was perfect for the beginner-intermediate stage. I'd say that while it is geared towards those who are getting older as far as maintaining balance and coordination and not too crazy dance moves, it was still fun and a good switch-up for me. I'll definitely be adding it to my workout stack!"
4,Kathy Smith rocks!,"I enjoyed this workout video much more than I thought I would at first. The workouts are easy to do, without being to strenous and a beginner like me did just fine. Kathy is not ""annoying"" like some people are in their videos and I didn't want to poke her eyes out with a hot iron in the middle of it, so that counts for something, too!"
2,Not what I expected from Kathy Smith,"The 3 separate 20 minute routines are okay, but the last one, energize felt like a waste of time and was boring. If you are a true beginner you will have no problem with this dvd."
3,Fast!,"I've admired Kathy Smith for a long time. It's been years though since I've tried any of her workouts. I knew that ""Ageless with Kathy Smith"" sounded perfect for me. The DVD offers three separate 20 minute workouts; Toning, balance and energy. She begins the first workout fast....for someone like me that is out of shape and older-it was difficult. Of course, all the workouts are quick-they are only 20 minutes! I'm used to using Leslie Sansone walking DVD's which vary in technique (i.e. boxing, speed walking, toning, etc) and fitness level. I know that Kathy is trying to get many things done in a 20 minute workout, but until I'm in better shape....I don't feel like this will work for me. There is a bonus section on here too. It has an interview and bio with Kathy plus a beginning yoga and exercise routine without Kathy."
3,A little cheesy,"It's OK. It's a little cheesy and I'm not quite sure that I'm getting a good workout in. She's a good teacher, just likes to screech once in awhile which is a little strange. Not sure that I'd recommend this to anyone that really wants a good workout. This is definetly for older people over 50-60+."
3,Did not really care for it,I gave this to my wife to try and she did not care for it. Some of the video was not realistic for total body.
3,Good all around workout...,"Ageless with Kathy Smith workout dvd is OK- it has 3 seperate workouts that targets specific areas, and works with different experience levels. Yes, the pace is a bit slow and the music more than a little boring but then again this is for an older crowd so thats not a huge problem I guess. Its not my favorite workout video but its good enough for when I need a little variety. Give it a try."
3,Meh,"This isn't the worst work out video out there, but there are much better ones out there, or at least according to my wife who has tried several. Her main complaint about this particular one was that Kathy seemed to be all over the place--one minute she's doing some weird stretch or difficult workout move of some sort but then says something indicating that 'that is probably too hard' and then she spends forever flapping her arms back and forth or doing some other sort of trivial work. Note that my wife uses the term ""difficult"" loosely as she is in her last trimester of pregnancy.If you are doing low intensity work outs and you are looking for variety, you could do worse than this video (esp. at this price), however, I can't say I proactively recommend it as there are lots of better options out there."
2,Who's the target audience for this?,"Two stars may be a bit harsh for this workout. It's not awful, but it's slightly less than average. I can't see myself ever doing this dvd again. While it's not irredeemably awful, there are too many better options out there to waste time on this one. Hence, two stars.I could not figure out who would benefit from this workout. While it's not difficult, it's probably too much for true beginners or those out of shape. The pacing is awkward, and modifications aren't given until a sequence is practically over. Anyone above that is going to be bored as the routines are nothing new (knee lift repeaters, anyone?). While I normally like Kathy, in this workout she's very annoying--lots of whoops and screams. She seems almost crazily cheerful, in a very off putting way."
3,"Seems Good, but Just not for Me","It is hard for me to rate this DVD as I just don't think it was geared for what I was looking for. My mom and I made a commitment to work out together and I thought this DVD would work well for both of us as my mom is older (68) and we are both beginners. I read a few reviews that said it is good for beginners, but I don't think they meant true beginners like us. We did the DVD a few times, but even with the modified moves it was a little too much for my mom and was too hard on her knees. I found it too fast for both of us too right now, I think we need to start out with something for real beginners first and work our way up to this DVD. I can appreciate the three segments of the work out and see how it could be beneficial down the road, but we need some time to get to the point of gaining benefit from this workout."
4,Wonder Workout,Love this tape by Kathy Smiht : Total Body Turnaround has all the features for aging people and cardio too. Not too hard but hard enough. I do it everyday and feel so much better.
2,Disappointed,"I enjoy Kathy Smith's aerobic workouts, however this one was a big disappointment.1. It's titled ""ageless"" which to me indicated older individuals would benefit. I'm over 60 and exercise regularly. Kathy's Baby Boomer workout and Cardio-fit workout are favorites; but, this one is VERY HARD ON KNEES!2. The aerobics interspersed with weights is too truncated; you get neither a good aerobic or weight-training workout.One positive were the balance exercises--but that was only one, short segment.I don't like giving bad reviews, but for $14.99 I was very disappointed."
4,Really like it!,"I enjoy this dvd. I can do one or two or three of the workouts if I want! It is a good workout, and I love the stretching on the totally energy, that is my slough day to be honest! It is perfect for in the morning when don't have much time. I would recommend totally, I can feel a difference all ready!"
4,Good Workouts,This video has three workouts on it. Each are good and get your blood flowing. The first one uses dumbbells for some of the workout. The other two have you going as well. They are fast paced but easy to follow. I like them because my heart starts going fast and I feel good after wards. I recommend it to anyone that wants help getting the exercise they need.
3,"Okay, not great","The Ageless with Kathy Smith: Total Body Turnaround video is divided into 3 segments. The circuit segment is a simple, but fun cardio and strength workout. Kathy uses mostly basic exercises; easy to do.The balance segment is a great addition and is really important to help prevent injuries and improve coordination and posture. The balance segment doesn't need any additional equipment.The final segment is the total energy workout, designed to wake up all areas of your body. A few weird dance moves, but okay.The music definitely needs improving, with the option for volume control. There is also no warm-up or cool-down portion, which I think is very important. This is an okay video for beginners."
2,Not for the Avid Exerciser,"I am in my late 20's and work out five days a week I enjoy getting my heart rate going quickly as I do not have a lot of free time to exercise. Short and efficient workouts are my preference. I like to add variety to my exercise regimen, so this seemed like a good one as it included three different segments. However, I had a hard time feeling like I got a true workout using this video. I also did not enjoy Kathy Smith as the instructor. She was hard for me to watch and feel motivated to work out hard.The three different segments include:Total Circuit which is supposed to be the cardio,Total Balance which is aimed to be the strength portion, andTotal Energy which is mostly a yoga sectionEach segment is about 20 mins long which is a great length, however it just did not feel like enough of a challenge. I would label it has a beginner workout, with the potential to be almost an intermediate."
3,Not for Me,"I just didn't like the feel of this workout; there is something missing in the sequencing. I know for me, it's not a good workout. To do this workout makes me feel like I am wasting my time. I do workouts like Hip Hop Abs, Barry's Boot-camp, X-Train & always feel like my time was spent wisely. This might be good for a beginner or an older person who hasn't worked out in a long time; I am 65 but have worked out all my life."
5,"Kathy Smith ""Ageless""","Great Video...replaces the one I had in VHS format (nearly the same routine, but a little different) that wasn't available in DVD. Order arrived quickly and without problems of any kind."
2,HMMM think twice before you buy,This is suppose to be a greatest hits cd and you get too many live tracks which are not all that great. Twisted Sister were a great band and its upsets me to see that so many songs were left out off the cd. Were Not Gonna Take It and Shot Em Down are great songs and if they were to missed from the cd I would have written to the record Label myself. Only for die hard fans
3,"Ahhh, the memories.","As I right this review (October, 2000) I am nodding my head and stopping my foot. Dee Snider was way ahead of this time. The singing (SCREAMING) may put some folks off but I find some of the lyrics quite motivational. Of course other lyrics are offensive to just about anybody. Sometimes, when you really wanna rock, you have take the good with the bad. Between the soothing vocals of Dee and the thumping, head bobbing rythyms of Tony Petri, Twisted Sister still moves me and makes me jealous of rockstars who can feel good about caking on the make up and keeping their hair in shape with a perm. Rock on Dee and never forget how good the early eighties were to everyone."
3,"""I Wanna Rock"" more.","This is a decent collection of one of the 1980's most notorious metal bands, but it should be better. It only has some of their best cuts, and replaces what should be here with live tracks. I would suggest getting their ""Stay Hungry"" album, which also has their biggest hits, others that should be on here, and one of the best album covers in history. I'd take that any day over this collection. This one's still pretty ""Twisted"" though."
2,No Way (but still a twisted fan),"Two stars, count them 2. It's not even worth that much,I'm being generous.Too many live cuts,if you want live music then buy a live album.What I wanted was a greatest hits cd and I didn't get one.I can think of better songs that could have been put on this disk.Two stars... one for each good song on this so called ""GREATEST HITS"" cd."
4,"Good stuff. Great band. Ahhh, the 80's......","I guess TS is a guilty pleasure. I've been around metal since about 1980 so I was there when they broke it big. Therefore I like the older stuff on this disc a lot more than the newer stuff. Recommended are: 'We're Not Gonna Take It', 'I Wanna Rock', 'You Can't Stop Rock and Roll', 'Shoot 'em Down' and especially 'Under The Blade'. TS was never a ""total"" metal band, not like Venom or Mercyful Fate or even Sabbath or Priest, they just happened to be rockin' at the right place and right time. But when they got fully wound up they could blast it out ""fast and loud"" with the best of them. There's a few missing cuts on this disc; like 'SMF', a few stinkers, and the live stuff is not really eye-opening. But this is a good buy for those who need a dose of a heavy metal, New York City, in-your-friggin'-face attitude. Crack a cold beer, hop in the car and crank it high! Unless you're a corpse you're gonna be groovin'. And that, after all, is the whole idea."
1,"Incest, rednecks and rubber suits...OH MY!","*Spoilers*This movie is about the last member of an inbred family that somehow transforms into an ugly man-gator thing after killing and eating the white alligator that ate his incestuously impregnated child bride. No...I'm not kidding.Our ""hero"" of the movie lives up to the name in every way. After being shot in the leg, he continues to sprint all through the swamp, killing rednecks and other bad guys. He also manages to kill the ""creature"" with his bare hands by ripping out the thing's jawbone. Which by the way, is all done off-camera. No...I'm not kidding.I rented this for $2.99 and I feel utterly cheated. This film makes Shark Night 3D (which was also brutally bad)look like an Oscar winner."
3,Not Bad,"Creature has been called one of the biggest box-office flops of all time, grossing less than one million dollars despite getting a wide release. I can see why the box-office was disastrous, being that it got absolutely no press prior to its release. Also, the biggest name attached to it is Sid Haig, who has mostly been in b-movies, many of them going to direct-to-dvd, which is probably what Creature should've done. It's not bad, but it's no better or distinguished that most of the Sy-fy original movies. It does deliver the exploitation goods, though. It has enough nudity and gore to satisfy. What it lacks is originality and a sense of real fun."
1,what a budget pos,This movie is one of the most awful hunks of garbage I have ever seen. The acting is like a bad acting class. The monster is a guy in a mask and the ending is like wtf x500 not even good in a zombie film kinda way
3,BEAST IN THE BAYOU,"Remember the giddy shivers you got from the rubber-suited CREATURE FROM THE BKACK LAGOON? This newest entry in that genre features an alligator-man bent on finding a new bride to keep his lineage going.CREATURE is allegedly the worst box-office disaster in modern cinema and universally reviled by pro critics and reviewers like us. The cliches are all included: the inter-racial lovebirds; the requisite lesbian segment' incestuous rednecks; and six friends running around doing stupid things. Mehcad Brooks (TRUE BLOOD's doomed Eggs Benedict) leads the charge as the ex-Navy Seal who ends up a bloody mess, but heroic nonetheless. Sid Haig and Pruitt Taylor Vince try gamely but the rest of the cast is just around to supply the copious body count. The twist at the end is a little surprising but inevitable. Lower any expectations and you can enjoy CREATURE for what it is--a delightfully cheesy beast flick."
2,Creature,"I saw this movie and thought, heck it could be worth a look. As I watched this I remembered reading online that this movie was considered one of the worst films last year. The story is decent, nothing to exciting but the main creature doesnt show up till an hour into the movie. The suit looks good but the face looks pretty stupid. It was a decent way to pass time but nothing i'd recommend. It was on a pile of dvds that fell over and this was the only one that ended up in the trash. Is that a sign or what?"
3,meh...,"this movie has high potential, a decent story, but falls to pieces quick. kudos on the Creatures suit, i can appreciate trying to bring back creature features, but the gore and scare was lacking and the story tends to fall apart."
3,Stay out of this swamp...,"If you are interested in this monster movie, you've probably been drawn to it by its reputation as a bad B-list ""Black Lagoon"" remake.What's to like: Nudity and gore.What's not to like: None of the characters really stand out, plot is hazy."
3,Middle of the road B-feature better than Hatchet 2,"All the people putting this movie down this turd was better than Hatchet 2 which was bottom of the pond cruddy. The cover makes this ""creature"" look like an Alien but its really a real version of KILLER CROCK from Batman. Who could complain about this movie when the first scene shows a full frontal nude scene from a cutie."
4,"Right parts, wrong instructions","Just a quick note about installing this system on a Dodge Dakota club or quad cab.The kit comes with two intermediate pipes -- one short, one long. The instructions say to use the shorter one for the regular cab OR the longer one for the extended/quad cab. You have to use both of them, but luckily an ""extra"" clamp is included in the kit. More clamps = more opportunities for leaks, so I wish they'd just send a ""long"" pipe that's about 6"" longer, but alas.Overall it's the same quality Flowmaster parts and it sounds great."
2,OK book,I needed this book for school. It was easy to read but the information is for people new to America and its standards.
1,"Eats batteries for breakfast, lunch and dinner","I was attracted to this mouse because of it's modest size and simple look. What they didn't say on the package or any of the web sites is that good alkaline batteries will only last a couple of days in it! Fine, it only costs about $25 for the mouse but you'll be spending another couple of dollars EVERY week just to keep it working. I previously had a Microsoft wireless mouse which would go for over a month on one set of batteries so this is just not necesary for this type of product."
5,Paranoia at it's best,"This short-lived and under-appreciated TV show which premiered in 1995 was unlike any other show on television. Only X-Files captured the chilling nature of conspiracy like this show did; but it's focus was on other things. Nowhere man instead focused on our very nature of perception, and nearly every episode focused on a different aspect of this fallible sense. And if you liked the X-Files, you'll see many similarities in Nowhere Man, from the atmosphere and the 'trust no one' attitude to the very background score by the talented Mark Snow.All in all, I am very excited that this unique show is finally being release on DVD. Go get it!"
3,"Amazing show, horrible packaging","I got my DVDs and opened it up, and there were DVDs sliding all over because of broken plastic tabs inside. These hard plastic packages are crap, and it's time they stopped using them. Now I'll need to move all the DVDs over to another case to keep them from getting scratched.Otherwise, amazing show, great DVD release, Nowhere Man was way ahead of it's time when it came out, and I think it would fare better today, even with a new cast and starting from the very beginning."
4,I hate cliffhangers - ask for more from a DVD release,Great show but like many others the viewer was left hanging. Other series with cliffhangers include Space Above and Beyond and Nowhere Man.DVD releases are a great opportunity to bring some resolution to a series. I know that a new final episode is unrealistic but why can't the creators include commentary of their vision of the series and resolve any cliff-hangers? If the studios want our money then lets ask for something in return.
1,Zoning,"With a show of this age why not release it un-zoned. I am a huge fan and it has not been released anywhere else, I can't play this at home. I am against down-loading and ripping off those who earnt there money but, it seems it would be forced upon us. Surely the main reason for the zoning is to allow shows (and movies) to be aired in different areas at different times... pointless and annoying :-("
1,"I didn't watch it then, and I didn't watch much now","a journalist takes a photo of soldiers illegally executing civilians. Easy solution to that one. Instead we wait 10 years and spend hundreds of thousands of $$$ to convince the man he is crazy. There is a nationwide if not global secret society even in little towns to help with this plot. Of course, there are thousands of innocent people having their lives destroyed, not just one man.I'm glad somebody liked it. There were attractive actresses starting with Megan Gallagher.it does not deserve to be compared with Prisoner or Fugitive."
1,Not for dogs - Good for kids,"I bought this ball because it was stated as being Heavy Duty; and I agree that it is a higher quality ball than traditional playground balls.We have an Australian Shepard and she tears apart all playground balls - we have scores of dead playground balls in our yard.This ball looked like it might have been up to the challenge.The dog played around with it for about 10 minutes....got frustrated, bit it, and it is now deflated.I also ordered the Baden ball but haven't received it yet .... hoping it might do the trick.I'm sure this ball is great for all purpose play; however don't buy it if you are planning on having your dog play with it."
5,Way up there!,"I just finished listening to Lenny's Tristan and man it's sooo good! I finally understand it after listening to so many versions! He brings out the wieght, the fire, the drama, the detail, the beauty, the depth, the clarity and most of all...the passion!The recorded sound is phenomenal and the singing is sumptuous with real meaning and realistic acting, sometimes I thought it was live!Despite the despising reviewers that detest this recording because of length or this or that, I love how Lenny draws it out! Once you immerse yourself in it, it takes you to the hieghts. It's a real experience, not just another Tristan. Take my word for it!"
1,Indulgent and under-cast,"This really can't be a first choice for the opera. In fact, it's one of the worst. Bernstein is so indulgent such that he misses almost everything the music has in offer. Hofmann is past his best as Tristan and Behrens comes to grief often as Isolde. Both simply has not the vocal means to tackle the title roles. A grave disappointment."
5,NY Yankees license plate,"New in shrink wrap. Carefully shipped.My daughter in law loves it; calls it her new ""Tennessee cop magnet""."
3,Essentially variable Byrds,"I love the Byrds, or should I say I love the sound of Roger Mc Guinn and friends as that is what their tunes sound like to me.The Byrds are incredible when they stick to short and cogent mini epics like 'He was a Friend of Mine','The Ballad of Easy Rider' and 'Wasn't Born to Follow',less so when trying to extract joy from material like 'Set You Free This Time' and the corny 'Chimes of Freedom'.I agree with the reviewer who rated 'Younger than Yesterday' as a masterpiece. If I could only get one CD by them it would be this. Some great tunes a majority of which stand the test of time with aplomb and a few that don't."
2,great songs; lame iteration.,"it says ""Over 2 hours of music"" on the front. disc 1 is 42:55; disc 2 is 51:45. the people at columbia have questionable math skills...this was a real missed opportunity for a great 2 disc compliation that dipped deeper than just the hits."
3,OK for what it is,"As a theologian, I was interested in what others had to say regarding the material in the Simpsons. (my area of specialization is religion in modern culture/media) Many of the points are well made but it seems that the author does not really ""know"" the program or the characters and is offering insight without understanding. The material and the characters are much deeper than Pinsky portrays them.This book is good for someone who has a passing interest in the religiosity of the Simpsons, but for serious study, look elsewhere."
4,SIMPSON FAITH,"As an Evangelical, I was very intrigued by this book.Author Mark Pinsky points out how The Simpsons does present a homogenous and religious society. Everyone from Mr. Burns to Cletus the Slack-Jawed Yokel are at the First Church of Springfield. Reverend Lovejoy is rendered as human full of his own frailties, and Flanders is the epitome of Evangelical Pride.Frankly, this is a more accurate portrait of American Christianity than Normal Rockwell paintings, and Leave it to Beaver reruns. In reality, Homer is a moron who does not pay attention in Church, Lisa lives in Utopian Idealism, and Bart is the flesh incarnate. In the end, they are all pilgrims in need of grace--just like the rest of us."
3,Good Read,"This book is a great example of someone who has done his homework. Pinsky offers up a great range of information which helps any Simpson's fan or layman understand the ""theology of the Simpsons"" better. This book is funny, insightful, and a good read. There is a slight drawback due to the fact Pinsky spends a lot of time quoting from unpublished Masters Theses from scholars that you have no idea what their point of view is. With that said, this book is still worth reading, and will provide entertainment for the educated Simpson's viewer. I did appreciate the fact Pinsky does a very objective job in reporting what he found through careful study of a mountain of material regarding the show. Of help would have been more interaction with the writers from the show directly with Pinsky, as opposed to secondary and tertiary sources. Overall Grade BJoseph Dworak"
1,"Not just bad, offensive and bad.","So the 2000 Presidential election was a referendum on morality? The Simpsons represent the values of just MIDDLE America? Maybe it's the times we're in but I certainly didn't appreciate the divisive tone of Mr. Pinsky's comments. Before he puts pen to paper again, I suggest Pinsky spend a little less time waving the good book and a bit more time actually reading it."
3,Interesting if inessential,"An interesting read and a sympathetic endorsement of The Simpsons from a sincere and appreciative theologian. I don't know if I agree with all of Pinsky's interpretations (and sometimes he can beat a plotline to death), but I do agree that there is a moral heart and a spiritual sympathy to the program that is generally missed by its detractors. The Simpsons often skewers organized religion to amusing effect, but anti-Simpsons often fail to see the real message behind the satire. There's a parallel between this book and the old ""Gospel According to Peanuts"" book, although I think the religious message in Peanuts was always more overt. Not an essential book, but diverting for Simpsons fans nonetheless and recommended."
4,Great night reading,"I really like this book, but it's so dry! I actually have a list of words to look up! I think this man loves his thesaurus. I'm glad, however, that he also loves The Simpsons. If I can ever finish this book, I'm sure I will be better for it! He makes some wonderful statements, and every example brings a delightful episode to mind. I'd love to take the class where this is the text book!"
3,"help me, jebus!","i really enjoyed this book and found it to be well-written and informative. it critiques the way different religions and spiritual issues are portrayed on ""the simpsons"" sitcom. it is very positively biased toward the show, which kind of surprised me - and pleased me, i should add. i really enjoy reading things that take apart and analyze different aspects of pop culture in an intelligent way and this book definitely qualifies. occasionally, it feels as if he reads a bit too much into the show on certain levels, like finding specific reasons for things that i just think are meant to be funny, but overall i found it entertaining and worth my precious reading time."
4,"A Stretch? Possibly, But Very Compelling","If you're buying this book thinking that it shows how watching ""The Simpsons"" saves souls, you should reconsider. This book doesn't focus on Simpsons providing the gospel through the show, this book focuses on the spirituality in general of the television series.I found this book to be an entertaining and serious look at the life of our beloved animated family, the book uses extensive show references to point out that ""The Simpsons"" *is* more spiritually relevent than ""Touched by an Angel"" or any other prime-time show.Pinsky points out time and time again how often ""The Simpsons"" tackle issues of morality and spirituality and even theology. While often satirizing Christianity and many other major religions, the show brings to light serious problems with the Church today.Again, this isn't a Simpson's sunday school reader, this is an organized and in-depth look at how The Simpsons relate to religion and deal with problems of spirituality."
2,Less than half this book is original material!,"This book is a cursory overview of the religious aspects of the Simpsons. There are not many real or new insights made in this book, about half of this book is episode summaries and much of the other half is filled with only the most obvious insights and other peoples' original ideas. I was very disappointed. I was not surprised to read at the end of the book that the author had not even seen all the episodes.Particualarly terrible was the chapter on the Catholic Church. He seem obsessed with the overhyped ""controversy"" between the show and a small Catholic watchdog group while avoiding any real discussion on how the show offers poignant insight on the relationship between the Church and other Christian denominations as well society in general."
2,Skip it.,"Being a fan of The Simpsons, I was excited to read this book. The purpose of the book is to examine the spiritual aspect of the show.The book starts out interestingly enough, by evaluating some of the characters and their spirituality. However, toward the end of the book, the author seems to spend most of the chapters giving the story line of several episodes without actually analyzing or thoroughly evaluating the spiritual side of the show.The worst part of the book was the concluding chapter. It seemed to be just a bunch on quotes from other people with no real point.Whether you enjoy or hate The Simpsons television series, this is one book you can skip."
2,For those that need validation,"This book is for those Christians that have secretly watched the Simpsons but were to afraid to admit it during Sunday service. It is a decent book, but points out the EXTREME obvious. The author claims most people who watch The Simpsons, even longtime fans, do not understand the meaning behind the actions. I think its plainly obvious to those with a brain.If you need a respected Christian to say something is OK before you partake in it, then this book is for you. If this book is capable of opening your mind then GOD BLESS THIS BOOK."
2,The Simpsons are NOT spiritual,"Anyone thinking that the The Simpsons are spiritual are not watching closely. Some things that Homer has said:""I wish God was alive to see this"", ""I bet Jesus is spinning is His grave"", and something to the effect that ""I proved that God does not exsist"", to which Ned Flanders agreed with. I love the show, but wonder if it may be a tool of Satan to brainwash young, impressionable viewers into believing that Christianity is a joke. Sad, actually."
2,Get the 71101 model instead,"I have both the 81101 (this model) and the better alternativeLucky Line 71101 Key Ring.I highly recommend the 71101 model. it is easy to open and stays securely closed.The model 81101 is very cumbersome with the twisting motion required, especially when loaded up, if you can even make it that far in the process."
1,Meh.,"Stupidly hard to open, which is a pro and a con.My wife has a 71101 and its only 10x better. Nothing is as much fun as dropping all your keys just to remove or add a key.The learning curve is just too steep for a keychain. Would make a good gift for the person who enjoys puzzles."
3,A little bigger than your average keyring,A little bigger than your average keyring. Otherwise it performs as advertised. Easier to add and remove keys than traditional keyrings.
3,Not bad,"Took a little to figure out how to use this. Difficult to open package withouttearing instructions. Now I can say it works fine, and solves my problem with bigcar keys which need to taken on and off. However, this key chain is small especiallyincluding the need to allow space for it to lock and unlock by making a heart shape so it will not fit many keys."
2,Dissapointed,"I have had a few of these from this manufacturer over the years and after just 1 month, the ring fails where it connects."
4,Twisty key rings,"I have used these key rings for over 30 yrs, and I have never had a problem with them. they are a great product"
2,opt for 71101,"Though the construction is sturdy, it's the opening and closing mechanism that's though intuitive is not practical. One has to make a weird 8 shaped twist to open or close the loop. With some practice though one can master it, it's becomes a pain when the ring is loaded with keys. I own both this and 71101. Both are of the same durable quality. 71101 is much easier to operate."
1,Don't waste your money.,"Firstly, as other reviews have stated, don't expect to get the same color as advertised. Secondly, if you do get it, who cares? This item is absolutely junk and susceptible to unlocking. Even though it is only a few dollars, avoid like the plague."
1,"Easy open, but not easy close","All I want is a keychain that I can easily get the keys on and off. This is not it. I agree with reviewers that said it's easy to open- twist it into a figure 8 and it pops right open. But no one mentions how to close it. Twisting it back into a figure 8 is nigh impossible; the thing is too small and way too inflexible, and I have relatively strong fingers. One reviewer says to follow the instructions on the package, but my ring didn't come in a package, it was loose in the envelope it was shipped in with no instructions; not even a receipt. It's going in the trash."
3,Very Strong But,"This is very hard to open and if you have keys on it, extremely hard to close. Model 71101 is much better, just as strong but easier to open and close."
4,durable but difficult!,"I have had keys somehow unravel and just fall off keychains in the past, but I like that this keychain is sleek enough to place the actual key on it, without the need for one of those assessors loops! I am very pleased with the design and durability and would give the product 5 stars, however it is a little difficult to open and close!"
1,Sorry...it's Just Very Boring,I lead travel tours across the country about 3 times a year and was hoping this might be a nice intro to the beautiful state that is Colorado. It wasn't. They spent an exhorbitant amount of time on a sheep rodeo type event and barely touched on the state's real treasures. Save your money.
4,A GREAT BOOK!,"Mariah Pijeaux was a classy, professional lady who carried herself with pride and confidence and her presence demanded respect from everyone except her boyfriend Kareem. She was in an unhealthy relationship and the only thing that bonded them together was the sex. There was no mental stimulation or emotional satisfaction and for most women if two-thirds of a relationship is already complete then the physical part will only add to that. I believe Mariah was with Kareem just because they had been together for so long and had gotten comfortable in the relationship. When Malik came along my first thought was of Angela Bassett in How Stella Got Her Grove Back, but Malik and Mariah's friendship was so much more. They each helped the other deal with some deep patriarchal issues. For their relationship it proves that friendship should come first and that sex should only be reached after the friendship has had a chance to evolve. A great novel with rich characters.Reviewed by: Sheila"
3,"Okay, Confusing...","Well, I do alot of reading, but, for some reason I just could not catch on to what this sister was trying to say. It appeared to me that she was more aware of the skin color and overall sex which does not make the man, at some time you need to come outside of the bedroom. I understand that she was an older woman, however, at times I thought she was much younger by her actions and words. I don't want to tear this book apart, but I think the story line was a little under developed."
5,WONDERFUL.....,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Once I picked it up I hated putting it down, but a sistah needed to sleep at night. Congratulations to Marissa Monteilh, you did a wonderful job. The characters were so real, the story was relating and this book took me places I have feared going for a long time. Thank you for sharing this work with the world. I will be recommending this book, to my friends, neighbors and book club members. Good luck in the future."
5,Great way to follow the Hot Zone,Second books normally fail in the eyes of the reader....but this book was just as good as the first! In this story Richard Preston takes you into the battle with Small Pox. Inside the irradication and the drama with the WHO in either keeping or destorying the Small Pox stash. If the Hot Zone left you feeling scared about Ebola.....you will be even ten times more terrified about Small Pox. This was a great way to follow up his first hit! I couldn't wait to turn the page to see what the scientist would encounter next. Defentially a must read! I highly reccomend this book and his first...the Hot Zone.
3,The Demon in the Freezer book review,"I really liked the book. As a fan of Richard Preston's books, I very much so enjoyed The Demon in the Freezer. Although it wasn't on the same level as The Hot Zone, I still found myself unable to put it down until the very end.If you have read The Hot Zone and enjoyed that, you will most likely enjoy this book as well. I highly recommend it to anyone. And if you like this book I also suggest The Cobra Event."
5,The Demon in the Freezer: A true Story,"Very, Very, Very good! This was recommend in a Teacher Education Seminar that I attend this summer as the one to read for a good ""Biology"" summer reading.Everyone should take the time to check this one out. The story just grabs you and I couldn't put it down until finished.Great research and very informational.After it's read, you will realize, your just one good ""sniff"" away from turning into a ""Blister"".My Grandfather born in 1891 had smallpox as a child, in fact all of his siblings did. (6) Total. All survived, all were scared but all lived. He as 1/2 Choctaw but being exposed to the farm animals in a rural setting must haved allowed the family genes to cope with the disease."
2,"May be a true story, but not well told","The first problem: the title. ""Demon in the Freezer"" would imply a singular demon, but the author keeps jumping back and forth between anthrax and smallpox; which one is the demon? It would seem to be smallpox, but the author spends an inordinate amount of time on the anthrax letters following 9/11, for no seeming purpose other than to re-hash the events in dramatic form. The book also jumps too much from topic to topic, seems to implicate one person in particular for the anthrax mailings, and doesn't really have any conclusions. The book is a narrative of on-going events - the anthrax case is open and smallpox is still around in freezers around the world. There is no closure at the end of this book - it leads the reader nowhere."
5,Another good Preston non-fiction book,Related to Hot Zone although about different viruses and events.You're not likely to forget either book! More good reading on a terrifying topic.
4,microscopic terror,It's what you don't see that can hurt you. Preston does a great job as usual in presenting the history of some of the most deadliest germs and viruses known to man. In this book the focus is on antrax and smallpox. If you are interested in a novel form I highly recommend THE COBRA EVENT.
4,Solid and Light Introduction to the Threat of Bio-Terrorism,"This book is a fascinating account of the current state of affairs regarding (primarily) smallpox, anthrax and the threat of bio-terrorism. It is well worth the effort as a light read and is reasonably well-written.I actually picked it up hoping it would contain more on the biology of pathogens, but the book's a little thin on that score. It relies chiefly on anecdote to give you a sense of the recent history of smallpox eradication efforts, the developing risk of biological pathogens being used by terrorist groups, political and diplomatic efforts to control access to these substances and how scientists study and respond to them.I could have wished the book contained a more scientific account of how pathogens work, how they are structured chemically, and why they are dangerous. However, this book doesn't purport to be a research tour de force, so don't expect the sun. The moon ain't bad."
3,Good technical stuff; Not coherent enough throughout,"This one jumps around quite a bit. Chronologically, it works OK, but many of the diversions I was led along were dead-ends. Why dedicate so much background info on Lisa Hensley (although I admire her very much) when it isn't pertinent? This book is right up Preston's alley, and he demonstrates quite a bit of research. But I'm not sure if 1.5 pages at the end is enough to finally learn what the author believes. Anyway, an interesting read nonetheless. My copy was library-loaned, and I accidentally spilled red wine on parts of the second half of the book. IT'S NON-TOXIC, don't worry ;-)"
1,Just awful!,"I was so excited to find this book after reading Richard Preston's other novel, The Hot Zone. I found this book to be written extremely inconsistently. While reading this book it seems as though Preston is changing from writing to a mature, educated audience to writing for an audience of five year-olds. He takes the time out to describe each new character in a bland way. His descriptions of these people consist solely of their hair and eye colors, stature, and way of speaking. WE DON'T CARE! I wish he had spent more time on the actual story instead of digressing. He also added random sections including one accusing Iraq of harboring weapons grade smallpox without proof. I was thoroughly disappointed in this novel! The only reason why I finished it was because I was too far into it to stop when I realized how much I truly hated it! If you liked The Hot Zone, don't read this, it's awful."
3,The Demon in the Freezer,"The book was in excellent condition, but it took a very long time to receive it. I ordered 3 other books the same day from the same region and received them 3 weeks earlier than when I received this book."
5,Mr. Preston strikes again! Bravo......,"I was chewing my fingernails all the way through this book. Yikes! If the contents of this work are accurate, and I have confidence they are, the implications are enough to keep you awake at night. Don't forget to kiss your kids as often as possible....."
4,"The end of the world may be a virus, not a bomb","Smallpox -- another piece of the highly complex 21st century puzzle that must be understood and put into place. In this highly readable account, Preston explains that smallpox is a particularly deadly killer that HAS NOT been eradicated, HAS been experimented with as a biowarfare agent, and MAY HAVE GREATER POTENTIAL TO WIPE OUT MANKIND than any atom-based bomb yet invented. This book is a highly palatable and enjoyable way to get the facts along with several surprises on the topic that will keep you thinking after you have turned the last page."
5,Great book!,"I don't know if the books I enjoy would necessarily appeal to everyone, but I loved this book! If you're fascinated by level 4 viruses or the prospect of bio-terror, there are several of Richard Preston's book I would recommend."
4,Definitely makes you think,"This book is a bit horrifying in what it all could mean. There is a lot of information in the science of some diseases, the researchers, politics, and even some personal stories. The science discussed was broken down in a way that doesn't feel too patronizing for non-scientists. I enjoyed the book, but found his writing style to be occasionally annoying. I feel like the flow of the narrative was often slowed by the constant description of a new subjects physical appearance. This book will really get you thinking about bio-terrorism, politics, medicine, and may instill a bit of fear."
3,it is only a matter of time,"OK. I'm a nurse and I read all things medical. Whether nonfiction or fiction, I buy them, read them, think about them. Yeah, this was scary about the smallpox, but my gosh, the author hopped aroudn describing mundane details when he should have been focused on the big picture.Who has smallpox now? I think someone knows or can conjecture. Very scary.I do belive a bio weapon is going to be deployed in the not too distant future --it is probably sadly inevitable. But I did like the book despite the fact that it needed some tight editing."
4,"Smallpox, Big Issue","Few writers have the talent to parlay a non-fiction work about viruses into a mass-market paperback, but Richard Preston has done it twice. ""The Demon in the Freezer"" focuses on many scary aspects of smallpox, and delights in the details of our demise should we encounter our old foe. For us today, reading about the skin completely separating from the body due to a halo of pus is both repulsive and fascinating; but the world once had an everyday vocabulary for these symptoms. With little natural immunity left around the globe and the smallpox shot the most dangerous immunization you can take, ""The Demon in the Freezer"" points to a nasty vulnerability.Preston talks with Ken Alibek, mastermind of the Russian bio-warfare program, and author of another excellent work ""Biohazard."" Also covered in detail are the anthrax attacks and the investigation of scientist Steven Hatfill."
4,Truth CAN be scarier than fiction,"In his frighting followup to his bestselling effort The Hot Zone, Richard Preston writes a chilling and honest examination of the history and the efforts to eradicate the smallpox virus.What makes this book work is the authors unflinching portrayal of the effects of the smallpox virus, it's resiliancy and the possible consequences of what could happen in the future if we are not careful or if the virus could fall into the wrong hands. Although not quite as chilling as The Hot Zone this is still a very effective bio-terror thriller."
4,Fast and exciting read,"The only reason for a 4-star review is I would love for there to have been more book. It is very well done but I personally wanted more. Excellent writing; the detail making you feel as though you are in the suits, sweating nervously in the face of a most evil virus. You won't regret owning this book."
5,Reads like a novel,"This is an excellent, though frightening, account of the history and future of the smallpox virus. It reads like a bio-terror novel, but is all the more frightening because it is non-fiction."
4,Anthing you need to know about smallbox and more,Bioterrorism. Biowarfare. This book makes you want to crawl into a pressurized suit and stay there. Richard Preston opens eyes and spins heads in this excellent book.We certainly are in deep trouble if smallbox is used as a weapon. Preston takes you to the edge and leaves you alone with your fears. Scary stuff.
4,Sobering,This is the first of Preston's books that I have read. I found it to be informative and sobering. I look forward to reading Preston's other offerings. I only wish that the audio version was unabridged and that is the reason for the 4 stars rather than 5.
5,A good book,"This book was recommended to me by a fellow scientist. Normally I wouldn't go for this kind of reading but in this case I did, and I didn't regret it.If you're interested in virology, mixed in with a little biochemistry and some thriller scenes, then this book is for you. No boring science here...The time line in the book is a little bit jumpy, location wise the same thing. But once you get the hang of it, this book reads so smoothly.The science mentioned in the book is sound and the information mentioned well researched."
3,"Interesting topic, but disappointing.","I read this book thinking that it would have more information about the anthrax attacks after 9/11. Unfortunately, the book dealt more with smallpox and how it has affected civilization. The book was interesting, but I was disappointed. The subject matter initially focuses on anthrax but digresses greatly in my opinion."
5,"Excellence, a fine read.","A very thorough history of the status of smallpox, the Eradication and the implications for the future in a world where man has chosen to maintain stores of the virus, with a population almost completely free of immunity or resistance and nation-states all too willing to develop bioweapons from those stores of smallpox variola. A gripping read from start to finish."
3,New Genre: Stoner Pop!,"Kyuss lite, not that I was ever a huge fan of Kyuss. Repetitive riffs rule the day here, sort of giving the album a trance-like quality. This may be a good or bad thing depending on your mood. The first three songs say it best here. ""Regular John"" was cowritten with John McBain of the incredible Wellwater Conspiracy. ""Avon"" was on Desert Sessions Vol. 3, and ""If Only,"" on the Kyuss split (both in superior versions). It might be a nice break from your steady diet stoner goop, (if only to give your ears a break) but there's not a lot of new sound broken here."
4,"Old but new, still rocks after more than a decade.","Given the age of this album being Queen of the Stone Age's first album, re-released, it still has memorable guitar licks and interesting vocals. Definitely worth the price of the album for sure. These guys knew the meaning of heavy metal without getting engrossed in satanic themes like many of the other metal bands. Kuddos to QOTSA!"
4,A great major debut,"Queens of the Stone Age's first album is great! It is fascinating to hearthe sound that is all their own. The lyrics ae enchanting-although it' hard to find out what they really mean, but sometimes that's what makes music...music. My fave QOTSA album is Songs for the Deaf, but I suggest buyng this one to see how they have grown as musicians."
4,"Actually, 4.5 stars","The debut Queens album sounds like it's caught halfway between Kyuss and Rated R. This, however, doesn't mean there's nothing good on here...this album is really good and full of bludgeoning ROCK! Standout cuts include Regular John, If Only, Avon, You Can't Quit Me, and Mexicola. Give this a listen and then move on the the rest of the Queens output and the Kyuss backlog to hear Josh Homme's awesome musical progression from stoner metal to hard-rock maverick."
5,superb!,"Discover Joshe Homme's hidden talent.. His voice! Great CD, a must have for every stone-rocker!"
3,"Not my favorite, but still rocks!",My Favorite album of QOTSA is Lullabies to Paralyze; but you can hear their sound coalesce nicely on this album.
5,Queens Of The Stone Age,"This is the debut album from ""Queens Of The Stone Age"",It is one of their best records ever.If your into bands like ""Foo Fighters"" or ""Nirvana"",you will love this LP!"
3,Poorly re-mastered Mozart,"The piano sound on these mid-1970s analogue recordings receives a tinny, metallic digital re-mastering. Right hand passagework tends to have a hard-edged sheen. Too bad for Friedrich Gulda fans, since the performances are keen and supple."
5,SUPER PAN,"PAN IS HUGE, HEATS EVENLY , CLEANS UP WITH NICELY AND COOKS LIKE GOOD CAST IRON SHOULD. IT ALSO RINGS LIKE A GONG WHEN STRUCK WITH A KNUCKLE SO IT MAKES A GREAT DINNER BELL."
5,cast iron big boy,"this pan is awesome. it is huge. it covers 2 burners on the stove and works great on the grill.we have made pan seared steaks, fried chicken and onion rings with out any sticking. this is a great investment piece for any kitchen. highly recommend for anyone looking for a very large skillet. it would easily hold 2 whole chickens."
4,Lodge 17 inch skillet,"Yes, it's heavy, doesn't fit on a regular stove, & heats unevenly with small burners. I bought it to use on a large high output outdoor burner, it's perfect for my use. I can cook a whole pound of bacon at once and deep fry enough crab rangoon at once to actually enjoy the party. Not a pan that I use very often, but when I do, nothing else comes close to it's utility."
5,great for a roux,"I cooked a turkey in the skillet and made a great roux in the drippings. The skillet worked well and helped make a great turkey, sausage,and okra gumbo."
5,Gabriel & Dresden's Mix is the only standout...,"Andain's ''Beautiful Things'' is a really great song, but the remixes here just don't do the job. The only great mix is Gabriel & Dresden's Unplugged Mix, like usual these guys create a great heady version of the song, applying keyboard effects-- I also think that this mix samples Sasha & BT's trance mix of Madonna's ''Drowned World (Substitute For Love)''.''Summer Calling'' (Import) was much better than this--- but other than that....I was allot more satisfied with Delerium's ''Truly'' (CD Single) compared to this-- because that was just EXCELLENT! It had allot more inspiring trance mixes.I was left very disappointed with this, Hopefully a better CD Single for this song is released in the near future"
4,A Beautiful Thing,"I first heard this song on Satellite radio while I was house sitting for some friends of mine. I was almost moved to tears! Mavie's glistening vocals and the semi-trance rhythm sent chills up and down my spine. This song is absolutely perfect. I bought the single to check out the other versions. While the G&D unplugged mix and radio edit are my favorites, other standout mixes are the Photon Project Remix and the Josh Gabriel remix. This CD is well worth it, for a truly moving experience."
4,The Ultimate in One Hit Wonders,Great song. Only song from Andain that I can find. The remixes are okay but if you just want the basic song and you don't mind 128kps then download it from Itunes. I gave it 4 stars even though the song itself is 5 stars because I'm frustrated that they would produce such a great song and then disappear.
1,Only Gabriel and Dresden mix is good,"I bought this CD b/c it had alot of different remixes. The only great remix is #2, G&D remix (they can nvr go wrong). The rest of the remixes were awful and hard to listen to. They took away the beauty of the singer's voices and the tunes."
5,Fantastic,"I first heard this spun downstairs at Fula, in Tokyo. It grabbed me the moment it came on. This is a real gem of a trance tune."
3,Alicia Silverstone Fetchingly Ingenue,"A very- pleasing book for all Teen-Angst Fans- especially those of Alicia'sthe ""Aerosmith Chick"". For those of uswho LOVE Drooling over Alicia- and everythingshe's in- you'll want to get this book toadd to your Collection. One very nice andinteresting tid bit of information is thatshe- Alicia, now believes that her religionis simply knowing herself and knowing whothe most important people in her life are-As opposed to an organized religion. Thisbook features many pictures in Black and Whiteand none of which that are in color. One reallyrare pict. that I have not seen before is featured inthis book- it is with Alicia and her brotherand two parents. I would have given this booka Higher rating if there were some color picturesin it- and not just Black and White ones.All in all a good- read, but, Don't expect Alicia'sLife story, this is just a Bird's Eye view of it."
4,ENCHANTING BUT BRIEF,"NEW ZEALAND IS INDEED A PLACE OF WONDER AND MAGIC BUT I FOUND THIS VIDEO TO BE LACKING IN A DEPTHNESS WHICH I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO HAVE SEEN. YES, IT SHOWED MOST OF THE MAJOR CITIES, BUT I WAS LOOKING FOR MORE OF THE BEHIND THE SCENES. BEAUTIFUL PHOTOGRAPHY AND AERIAL SHOTS. IF YOU HAVE 70 MINUTES TO SPARE THIS IS WELL WORTH VIEWING."
4,Rough Grandson,My six year-old grandson is rather rough on toys and gets bored rapidly. We gave him three of this size Transformers for Christmas and they kept him entertained all day and he didn't break any of them!! That was a real surprise!
3,Who cares where quality comes from?,"I live in Florida and i was comletely naive of Canadian hip hop... Not that i'm bragging... swollen members and Kardinal Offishall have hella talent and resemble a Tribe Called Quest in relevance from ten years ago. True hip hop fans need to embrace the gifted and worry less about location and image, and we'll see who we're still talking about ten years from now... kardinal or jah rule? kardinal, thanks for being true to your music..."
4,Opinions,"I was told by a friend... He felt that the words in the song blasts ""American"" rap talkin about it is nothin compared to how they do it in Toronto...or wherever this ""star"" is from...he believes that although he is doin his own thing, he is flaw with the amount of respect he gives to his fellow rappers...I didnt agree until he gave me an example...what he told me changed my view a little...but i believe in my opinion that all artist diss at one point or other and that sells...and for a rapper in ""T-Dot"" to come out blastin like he did I am sure the people of toronto loved it...but I mean with all do respect...I see where my friend is comin from..."
3,the favershams,the Favershams is not as good a story as Sir Cedric in my opinion. However the book does have wonderful illustrations and that cozy everyday feeling of life in old England.
5,"Ignore Negative Reviews, Movie is Great!","The general public (sadly) enjoys only horror movies that deliver tons of action and a incredibly easy story to follow. Luckily for some of us, once in awhile there is a director that dares to challenge us and make us figure out things for ourselves. Altered is such a movie. Aside from the little paragraph on the back of the DVD, we are forced to put together the pieces of why these men are trying to catch this creature and why they need to keep it alive. Blair Witch fans will be expecting this to be a similar movie, but its quite the opposite. Without giving away too many spoilers, we get to see the creature this time around... a lot. Definitley watch this one at night time alone in a dark room for full effect. Haxan delivers once again!"
4,refreshing and fun.,"This is essentially about a bunch of hicks who kidnap an alien. The longer the movie goes, the more we find out about the characters, and what starts as an assortment of 1 dimensional characters begins to flesh out a bit. Don't get me wrong, this isn't a character study by any means. It really is a bunch of hicks who kidnap one of the aliens that kidnapped them so many years ago, but it has a refreshing sense of humour, and it's smarter than I expected it would be. They take their time letting us know the back story, and they keep the tension ratcheted up.The special effects are pretty minimal, but sometimes very unsettling. I really appreciate it when a movie with a small budget goes for fewer effects and maintains quality. Real makeup and animatronics are so much more convincing than CGI.If you do enjoy this, you should also check out Splinter."
3,good for a view........,"I wanted this movie to be great but after a while it became obious thatthe scenarios has been done before..its like deja vu...alien in the house, alien escapes, etc..etc. The production was pretty good,also some of the acting.... The movie gets 3 stars because for whatthe movie has it offers it in a professional mannerand not in a hand held camera fashion like that Blair Witch Stuff..."
3,altered,"THIS MOVIE WAS O.K, BUT WHAT I REALLY WANNA KNOW IS........WHAT WAS UP WITH THE FROG SPACESHIP? THEY COULD OF THOUGHT OF ANYTHING ELSE BESIDES A FROG SPACESHIP! JUST SEEING IT HOP INTO SPACE WAS RETARDED!"
1,The worst movie ever put on DVD,"The Blair Witch Project was really really bad but this is worse. Filmed at night just like the Blair rip off, you can hardly make out what the hell is going on most of the time.Bad acting, no plot, and filming fit for the worst of home movies this is one that you will can do without viewing.save your money"
2,Gore and little else.,"This movie is about a group of rednecks obsessed with revenge against the aliens that abducted them and experimented on them fifteen years ago and that killed their friend. They manage to capture one of the aliens and things go downhill from there with the alien, that seam to have the interests ripping people's guts out, yes literary this monster like guts, biting and mind control, gets loose again and again to kill pepole in the group. Pretty standard monster movie.And there it is there is nothing new in this movie what so ever, there is a bestial slimy monster, pepole trapped in the wood an lots and lots of gore. The story is paper thin and the special effects is not so special.This is a B movie flick. It can be all right on a slow night when you want to see an monster movie and some senseless mayhem, but there is nothing else in this movie. The plot, acting all is bad."
3,"Not bad, but would have been better with a bigger budget...","The whole idea of alien abductees trying to get even by capturing their alien abductors is quite a novel plot. Whats missing is a few flashbacks of the alien process,(would of reqired a bigger budget) that would emphasis why these guys hated their captors so much. Instead they express their frustration through profanity and raging dialogue, causing the viewer to have little sympathy for them. The make-up artists do pretty well with the alien creature's appearance, though I think at least in part it's look is owed to something from the ""X-Files"". Theres some good plot twists and plenty of creative gore. Worth the rental for a weekend frightfest!"
4,Altered.,"Altered is not for the squeamish or weak, although a Indie/B-movie, I liked it, It's not what your used to. There is gross stuff I don't like (SPOILER) Pulling/playing with a guy's intestines,Yuck. despite Actors I don't know or okay acting, I think it was one of the scariest movies I have seen while at the same time creative. It's on NF to see for yourself or rent it."
4,Actually Really Good,"Altered is gripping, and sets you down right in the middle of a situation that is pretty serious: some rednecks go a alien huntin' in the woods - but their catch may be a lot more than they can handle. Above average acting, lots of creeps, lots of gore, and it is double scary watched at night alone - if you can handle it.The story is pleasantly reminiscent of the X-Files, since the story centers around a past alien abduction. What is unique is the victims seeking revenge. All the backstory unfolds as the film progresses, there are a couple of surprising and very good twists. I really recommend this film. And I must make mention that the music is perfect for the film. Unique hollow sounds, of wind, of metal on metal, really suit the mood and create an atmosphere of otherworldliness."
1,Stupid hicks.,"Watching these idiots trying to capture an alien is like watching a bunch of piglets trying to capture a wolf, overmatched both intellectually and physically. What is the whole point of keeping this thing alive anyway? Why not just kill it and dump the body? Someone wants to make a movie out of it, that is why. That is how much mental capacity the movie makers think their audience have nowadays. That is why we have the Jackass movies and this. That is why our country is in the state it is in. At least the Jackass movies are funny. This one, not so much. Would I hire any of these people to work for me, heck no!"
5,Catching My Breath!,"Instructions: Lock all the doors, turn out the lights, don't make a sound, sit with your back against the wall and make sure you keep your seat belt fastened at all times.When movie is over try not to think twice about the bumps you hear in the house.I loved this movie!I must tell you it was one great and intense ride. The little beastie was quite the nasty monster. The plot was so well written and the acting was first class. This is one horror movie for the books to keep. It did not seem to require any computer graphics, just good old fashion acting and old fashion FX.I was on the edge of my seat waiting for the little beast to keep popping up and never got comfortable enough to let my guard down.Do not compare to the ""Blair Witch"" because it is nothing like it. This ranks up there with the best of them.But I like others have to ask, WHY on earth did this go direct to DVD?"
5,SEXY,I have this in white and they are so cute. I love the cork look it makes them not look so stripperish because the heel is so high. They go with everything dress them up or down without looking trashy.
3,Weird!,"I hate this book. An older sister won't share her toys with her younger sister, but she thinks sharing her colds, warts, brussle sprouts, etc count. This teaches kids that sharing warts and time outs are better than sharing toys. I only gave it a three because I liked the pictures."
4,20 minutes is not enough!,"great graphics, great music, marc looks pleasantly strung out.a warning to all...this video is a mere 20 minutes and 5 songs, unlike a lot of other videos in the musik laden series."
2,not good,"Pretty cruddy kid's book that tells the story of three brothers who are given magical items by their father. One of them loses all of them to a wicked queen, and has to get them back by means of a ruse. Why didn't the queen just order her guards to take the nose medicine?"
1,The Cardiothoracic Surgery Resident Pocket Survival Guide,"Simple and superficial guide. Just for students, not for residents in Cardiothoracic Surgery."
2,Didnt like it,"It is just a little book made for interns, not cardiothoracic surgery residents, not even general surgery residents interested in cardiothoracic surgery. It takes me more money to send it back that keeping it, else I would wanted my money back. I do not Recommend this book for residents."
5,Everyone should read this book!,"I read this first over20 years ago. It's a wonderful and inspiring story. I was fortunate enough to find a copy or ""Karen"" in a used book store,and would love to get the sequel also. Please put these back in print!"
4,With Love From Karen,"I thought this book was a wonderful book. It showed a family that struggled through hard times but pulled together. They could always count on each other for love and support. It was great to read about how they drew upon their faith to get them through the hard times. It was inspiring to read about Karen's triumph over her handicap. I would like to find out what happened to the family. I have read through these reviews that Marie and Jimmy were divorced and that Marie probably died from lung cancer in the 1980's. If anyone has further information or knows where to look, please e-mail me."
2,Blue onyx?,A little disappointed as ring has a lot of nicks & rough looking. The onyx looks more dark blue than black.You can tell it's not an expensive ring.
2,Not exactly what I was looking for,I was amazed how very few choices you have if you are looking for books to help with emotional support during such a lose. I found Grieving the Child I never Knew much better since I was looking for something in a Christian format.
1,Broken on delivery,"Although well packed and boxed the cartridge was broken at the left side hinge when I unpacked it. I tried it in the printer but the printer would not even print blank pages. I did not contact the seller or try to return the cartridge because 1) I need toner now, and 2) I tried to epoxy the break which did work but only for 5 pages. The pages that printed looked great, but I would only recommend you buy this if you have the time and patience to suffer though a defective product."
2,product did not work,"The product looked nice, and all components were there. But, it did not work, and I had to pay out of my own pocket to return it. I did get a full refund of the purchase price, though."
4,"beautiful, but few pages and paperback","I bought this book after seeing one with the same title and photographer in a bookstore while traveling. I thought it was the same book, but this one is paperback and only 80 pages (1/4"" thick). The pictures are beautiful, but if you're looking for a coffee table book, this isn't a good choice--it's too thin and flimsy. You'll need to be careful to make sure you don't damage the pictures while viewing them (e.g., by creasing them if you open the book too wide)."
1,disappointing,"this DVD is more like a TV magazine news show than a travel DVD. It's too expensive and you can get better information from watching The Travel Channel. Also, it advertises HD, but the video looks standard quality. It did not play on one of my players. I noticed that the DVD is burned by a computer rather than replicated in DVD plant."
2,This one is totally show horse orientated.,"Lots of greased, shaved, photoshopped horses. No articles on other disciplines. To be fair, I base this on the free issue I was sent, plus issues I have flipped through of my friends.....who agreed with my assesment. For this reason I have never subscribed to this magazine. It is the show industry who advertises though...sadly understandable."
2,"Cute, but not worth buying.","These balls (I bought two) deflated almost immediately and will not stay inflated even after refilling them replacing the plugs (with new plugs), etc. They do not stand up to use as stated by other reviews I read in the past."
5,Pretty in Pink!,"You can't go wrong with safety gear like this. I got this one in Pink for my wife's new car; gave the old one to the buyer of here old car. I bought all my immediate co-workers at both of my jobs, and 3 for myself for Christmas. The kind of practical gift for those you truly care about!"
5,Great,"Have not had to use it yet, but it looks exactly as it was discribed and if fits nicely on the side of my door incase I need it. It is also light and small enough to put in a purse or overngiht bag if needed to."
4,Good product,"Good product, HOWEVER, I was disappointed that the pink breast cancer ribbon was NOT on the hammer (as shown in the picture)."
3,Would like different installation method,Only problem I have with this item is that they want you to screw it to your dashboard or console. Not exactly what you want to do with a new car. So my husband still has them sitting in our house instead of our cars.
2,smaller than it looks,This hammer is so lite and skinny it would hurt your hand to use it to break a window. The head of it is not very big or heavy.
3,"Great hammer, terrible mounting system","The hammer itself is great- lightweight, sturdy construction, 5/5 stars. The mounting bracket is another story entirely. It has to be installed with screws, yet the instructions recommend against doing this yourself for fear of damaging electrical wiring. Then they suggest using velcro or double-sided tape, but none is included in the box. To make matters worse, the bracket is concave, so you can't install it against a flat surface. I'm debating whether to return this product- I know it's important to have in the car, but it's going to be impossible to install."
2,bad quality,"I agree with the other poster on the pics being misleading, the unit is somewhat flimsy and light weight, you would think it would be made of metal and be a bit more heavy duty for the pricing. Pricing should be half of what it is for the quality of the unit. Too bad I bought 2. Hope I never have to use them."
3,Saftey,Well the hammer works tested it works well the blade not so much my pocket knife cuts better. The blade needs a wider mouth.
3,Excellent curio for Hensley fans,"From Time to Time is really two albums in one. The first ten songs are made up of outtakes and odd recordings throughout Ken's career from the late seventies to early eighties, which together can be seen as making up a fourth Ken Hensley solo studio album. The rest of the album compiles some excellent session work of Ken's with members of Free/Bad Company. These six songs are remakes of three of Ken's solo songs along with three Uriah Heep songs each done in a new way that should be a real treat for fans. Although the studio songs are not nearly as good as the material on Proud Words and Eager to Please they are much better than most of that on Free Spirit and a fan of Hensley's music will find much here to delight him or her."
4,A Fitting Release for an Epic Series,"All that I can say about this release is that it is spectacular. Lots of very good ""Extra Content"" accompany all of the episodes throughout it's five year run. My only complaint would be the packaging. The disks tend to not stay in place all of the time. This is the only reason that I gave it 4 out of 5. My true rating would be 4.75. I would also highly recommend the book ""Combat! A Viewer's Companion to the WWII TV Series"". Get it while you can. I believe it will not always be in print and the information that it contains is very enlightening."
5,Excellent,The series is excellent quality and we received the order so fast.It came well before it was expected to arrive which was great as it wasa birthday gift and he loved it!
3,Missing Discs,My wife received the Combat -the complete series for chhristmasWe were watching one or two episodes a night.then lo and behold when we got to folder 5 we found all of the discs missing.So if you purchase this item OPEN it and make sure all of the discs are there
1,I havent Recieved it nor has it been shipped,"I placed the order for the Series Combat well over a month and a half ago and it hasnt been shipped yet. So anyone who is ordering this or reading this at all... Dont even bother I havent recieved it or any notifactions about this product since then. Quite disapointed. Its a great series to watch, I love Combat but if its not at my house then how am I suppose to watch it?!?!"
5,The Best Series Ever!,"Why was/is Combat so great? Great stories. Everybody loves a good story. For example, if you want to see an anti-war masterpiece, watch ""The Volunteer."" A young ""gung ho"" French boy learns a painful lesson--To know your enemy is to love your enemy.The characters become like a part of your family. You care about them. Like all of us they struggle and have their strengths and weaknesses. However, their generation was ""our greatest generation"", as Tom Brokaw's book called them.And Vic Morrow--what more can you say. ""American cool"" equals James Dean in ""Rebel Without A Cause"", Paul Newman in ""The Hustler"" and Vic Morrow in ""Combat!""These stories never get old. They are always fun to watch."
3,Cuts from the orignal series,"I grew up watching combat and thought it was a great series. I was the youngest of 5 sons and we were glued to the TV when combat was on. I bought the entire series and have watched them all. The video seems excellent but I was extremely disappointed to find that there have been numerous ""cuts"" from the original. The biggest set of cuts involve Caje and his knife throwing ability. Each of the group had different weapons with which they excelled. To cut all accounts of Caje's knife throwing capabilities was a horrible exclusion. If there is there a way to get an uncut copy of the original series, I would be willing to do that. As it is, it was nice to have most of the Combat series but I wonder what else was cut.Randy"
3,Some DVD's are defecting,"I bought this DVD collection two years ago. I almost finish watching all episodes but some of the discs have defecting burning, they stop at the middle with out any reason even I try on different DVD player and too hard to re-play again."
5,the best ever!,"This is a wonderful series of excellent scripts, directed and acted at the highest level. The stories themselves are so good, it makes the episodes of present day series seem childish.Perhaps it's the morality of the characters and how magnificently they're portrayed. It took me over two months to watch all 153 of them, but I stopped watching new programs when I compared the quality with the Combat series. It was interesting to watch the characters grow as they went through the five seasons. The extra features of the directors and actors discussing the episodes was an eye-opening adventure into what went into the production of this quality of programming.This is a DVD set that I will watch with my grandchildren as they get old enough to be taught about honor and values and the frailties of men. Best money I've ever spent on entertainment."
3,bob miller's SAT Math for the Clueless (really for the clueless),"This might improve your score if you are a retart (not a real word). Although his affected excitement is funny in places and this book is fun to read, it isn't deep enough. He doesn't talk enough about functions. If you're planning on getting an 800, you'd better use another book that divides the test into four or five main topics instead of a zillion <--- (word he uses) little topics that don't really stick to each other. Use it to boost your self-esteem, not your score."
1,Total Waste of Money,"""This product stopped working less than 2 weeks after getting it. Both the auto and wall charger!!! I bought this for my girlfriend and it worked fine the first 1 1/2 weeks or so. Then her car charger stopped working. About half a week later, the wall charger stopped charging. The LED still functioned, but the phone wasn't charging at all.I could understand one of these accidentally being bad, but having both fail within a week of each other is rather suspect. I would not recommend this product to anybody... maybe as a chew toy for my dog."
5,What a classic . . .,"This is a great CD both for listening and to add to your Christmas collection. For years I had it and recently lost the CD. Now I am desperate to replace it. If you come across it, but it because you will definitely enjoy it."
2,Lesser,"Very hot and cold.. Most of the tracks are pretty hard, but very simple and a bit cheezy. Dyslexia, by X, however, is really well done, and bloody hard. It's almost worth it for this track alone."
3,Some defective discs,"Out of ten discs, one was defective and another had a broken jewel case (don't know whether the damage to the jewel case is attributable to the manufacturer or the shipping). The other discs worked fine, but that's a disappointing defect rate."
1,I did not receive what I ordered.,"I just want to say that I have bought this item many times from Amazon. On Nov. 9,2008, ordered 2 of the orange box Sony 10 pack disks, dvd-rw.What I received were 2 boxes of Sony 10 pack disks, dvd-rw, in a yellow box in THIN JEWEL CASES. I need the full size jewel cases that come on the Oracnge box. These are not what I ordered. I don't mind the product changing, but I do mind ordering one thing and being sent another.I will not be buying these from Amazon again."
3,recorder discs,It did not work onmy recorder no fault of disc just my recorder which I have gotten rid of finally.
4,Good for older DVD recorders,"These are not exactly as pictured. The picture looks like they're in regular jewel cases, but they are in the slim cases. These are the only kind of DVD-RW's I've been able to find that still work in my older model DVD recorder. Even so, I have to put them in twice to format before they will work. The first time I put them in and it starts to format, an error comes up saying it won't work in the recorder. I happened to try again, and the second time worked. It's like that with all of them, but at least they do work."
4,Good Deal!,"The DVD's are good. The casing is a little thin and seems not that strong, but it would hold the DVD safely if placed on the desk. One of the DVD case was broken a little bit from the side when I opened the package, but I suppose that was during the shipping of the package."
1,Defective,"I ordered a 10 pack of these in December 2008 and they worked great. I then ordered another 10 pack in March 2009 and they were all defective. You can't return DVDs once opened so use another brand, don't take a chance."
5,Superb mounts with every mouinting option under the sun,"I got these for my two pairs of Definitive Technologies Pro Monitor 1000 satellites on my home theater system.They are very solid and easily hold these fairly heavy (for their size) speakers. The PM1000s are a challenge not just for their weight but because the keyhole or threaded hole are on the extreme upper or lower end of the speakers and the leverage working against the mount's holding capacity is made even harder than if they attached at the center.These Peerless mounts were far stronger than Definitive's own proprietary mounts supposedly designed for my speakers. With the inferior DefTech mounts the PM1000s ""drooped"" no matter how much I tightened them. With these Peerless mounts they are solid as a rock.These also include any and every type of mounting option one can think of.Not as cheap as some other mounts out there but the build quality is clearly there and I won't risk my expensive satellites on cheapie mounts which might break."
4,$23 Dollars for the KINDLE version??,"First off let me say thatI am a huge fan of N.T. Wright, his works continue to inspire and inform me. My sole problem is the price of the Kindle version of this book at $23."
5,Where do we go from here?,"Dr. Wright clarifies for us the meaning of current knowledge that has been gleaned from history about what it means to the world that Jesus was resurrected. The most profound of all findings is what seems is in store for all of us. We too will be resurrected, given a new physical body that will never corrupt, live in a new world that is free from all corruption, and will serve God as willingly as he who was firstborn into the new world. This new world is here, on earth as it is in heaven, in answer to our prayers!"
4,Kraftwerk on an off day?,"I read somewhere that J.C. Bach sounded somewhat like Mozart on an off day.Well, former Kraftwerk member Karl Bartos split the pioneering German techno band to form his own, Elektric Music. Esperanto sounds like the next Kraftwerk album, romanticizing television watching, and singing the joys of the internet (""Information wants to be free""). There are no bad tracks, but the album is missing something. Still, Kraftwerk on an off day is a compliment, so if you like techno, then you will like this."
5,Truly Teutonic,"If you are a fan of the German Electronic music scene, you will love this cd. Every song on this album is likable, meaning you can listen to each of them many times over. If you are a fan of Electro-Tecnho music, I recommend this title very much!!"
3,"Not great, but it beats nu metal","I'll be brief-the best 220 Volt album, by far, is their 1988 release ""Eye to Eye."" Any 80's metal fan unfamiliar with this album would be well rewarded if they can get their hands on it. Check out YouTube-""The Harder They Come,"" the title track, etc.""Pwergames"" isn't a bad album either, but ""Lethal Illusion"" and stuff prior to ""Eye to Eye"" is clearly a cut below."
2,Wow...I had the exact same experience,"Gosh...my experience was the exact same as the reviewer previous to me. I recieved my dishes but the serving pieces were missing. I hunted down the amazon customer service number ( a feat by itself) and called customer service. They told me that someone from UPS would pick up my dishes the next day (never happened). I left it at that, I had wanted the dishes for a dinner party that I was having that weekend and felt that if I had shipped them back, I would never have got them in time. This has been a frequent occurance using amazon, something has always been missing or the packing is that horrible, that everything is broken by the time it gets to my doorstep. I don't understand. Wouldn't it be easier to send me the two freaking serving dishes then pay for shipping for a huge, heavy box of 40 dishes????"
3,missing stuff,Totally disappointed ...after spending so much money it came with no bowls as shown in the pic !!yeah wat good is the set without bowls ...
2,Quality control and packing skills are lacking.,"Recently I ordered the Mikasa Parchment Red Fine China 42-Piece Dinnerware Set, Service For Eight. Fortunately, I received the china, but unfortunately, the serving pieces were missing and one plate was defective. Following the guidelines, I packed up the china and Amazon sent a second set. All should have been fine, but no, it gets worse. The serving pieces were again left out of the order and now I have two thoroughly broken tea cups. I guess Amazon will once again want the china sent back, but how can I be sure I'll get 42 rather than 40 pieces in return?Oh, the china is beautiful, but is it beautiful enough to overcome this aggravation? Not sure yet.i"
5,Well worth the investment,"This is a gorgeous set. It arrived in perfect condition and looks even more beautiful than it shows in pictures. I had a little problem with UPS guy leaving it outside my door, without ringing the bell for delivery. My neighbour found it and kept it until he next saw me. By the time I found out what really happened I had already called Amazon and UPS to file a complaint. Unnecessary stress, that does not take away from what matters: a beautiful set on my dinning table."
5,EXCELENTE Y COMPLETO ALBUM,"ES UN EXCELENTE CD, TIENE PRECIOSAS CANCIONES CON TODO TIPO DE GENERO COMO BALADAS, POP, SALSA, RUMBA, INCREIBLE PRODUCCION, MAGNIFICA INTERPRETE, ES UN ALBUM PARA COMPRAR Y GOZAR.!PRECIOSO!"
5,An Awesome Read,"This book is an easy read with clear cut points that can help any organization. This common sense book is well-contructed; written in such a way that you can identify with it. Lencioni creates personalities that are familiar in the workplace, types that we deal with daily. I see such value in this piece that I purchased copies to hand out to the partners at a design firm where I work."
5,Interesting and helpful to our team.,Wonderful book. The format really helped me to understand what the author was getting across. We are currently putting this method to work in our company and changes are starting to happen in a very positive way.
5,Excellent resource,I read this book because our team needs some help. I have now passed it on to the owner of the company to read and have purchased the Field Guide to follow through with the ideas conveyed in this book.
4,A FOUR cushy chair book,The Five Dysfunctions is a good book but it has quite a bit of wasted space. It took me about an hour to read it. The first 170 pages are a fictional story about a team with the five dysfunctions and how the new CEO dealt with it. The last 25 pages is really all you need to read to get the meat of the book. Or just read my outline and you can have it even more concisely. I would encourage you to read the fictional account because you see Patrick put skin on these dysfunctions. You WILL be able to relate to these characters.The book doesn't get my highest rating simply because it spends too much time with the story and too little time with the meat of the book. Read my outline at www.themoralbusiness.com and then decide if you want to order it.
4,Good for team improvement,This is an easy read. The principles are applied within a story. Useful tool to use for improving team moral.
4,The Five Dysfunctions of a Team: My Point of View,Quick read. Relevant to identify issues and take steps to building a team. Good insight and perspective. Good reference book for developing and established teams.
4,Still applicable two years after reading especially after merger,"I brought my ""Five Dysfunctions of a Team"" by Patrick Lencioni book into the office last week and wanted to draw on the examples from the book in relation to a reporting problem we were having. I read it a few years ago but it just jumped out as still applicable once I picked up the book again. I once heard someone say it is the books that stand the test of time not the books on the current best sellers list that are worth reading. This is one of those books, as it was still valuable two years later.After pondering our problems due to recent mergers I think this case study illustrates many of the larger issues post merger companies have had and will continue to have in my now merged together company. These problems will never go away in most companies, especially in the era of so many mergers, so periodic review and trying to improve them will be a constant struggle."
5,An Essential Read for Leaders,"As a manager at fortune 500 company with over 50 billion in revenue, I had never encountered a dysfunctional team until this last spring.I read a number of books on teamwork and leadership and ""The Five Dysfunctions of a Team"" shows the importance of trust, debate, commitment, and accountability better than any other book I read. The story is engaging and the lesson invaluable. This is a must read for leaders."
4,Good Business Lessons,"One of the important take-aways from this book is that for a team to be successful, all persons on the team must be loyal to the team. This is a concept from successful sports teams that us in the business world could learn from. I enjoyed this mentality and feel that if more businesses were loyal to their work-teams we would have successful cross-team communications instead of the push and pull that often exists. I would have liked to have seen more of a story-line with the marketing versus analytical teams, but nonetheless this is a good fable for any manager or team leader."
4,The reality of teams,Patrick writes in a very informative style that takes the reader throught the subject matter in very understandable and realistic situations. Having lead several business unys and with my work as a business consultant it was easy to relate to the story characters and the business problem.Well worth the price of the book and the time to read it.
3,Missing the point about leardership,"While the different points elaborated in this book are valid ones, the team would not have improved without obvious leadership qualities of the main character.Great leaders make great teams happen. Still the author does not mention one thing about this."
3,What does he have against Marketing?,"As a marketing exec, I find it pretty tough to stomach Lencioni's not so thinly veiled hatred toward marketing. In this and ""Five Temptations...,"" marketing personnel are portrayed as negative influences on the team. In this story, the marketing exec even is fired without due cause. When this book was assigned to our ""team"" they left the book discussion with hatred for my department, as opposed to a renewed spirit of teamwork. It did more harm than good."
1,Borrow it from the library,"Not a bad read, but not a keeper. You can read it in 2 hours and realize you already know the major points."
1,Useless stack of manure - pure dreck,"I've never hated anything more than this useless pile of garbage. Not only are any lessons from this fable (by the way, fable?really?) either utterly pointless or redundant, the writing itself is terrible. It's atrocious. It's almost impressive how far Lencioni goes to avoid actively describing how his characters act. People also ""seem"" to react ""as if"" things we're happening. It's like Lencioni doesn't realize the narrator can just tell you that somebody was shocked. Nope, we are told that the ""seemed shocked."" And the number of times people nod in this book is maddening. Truly an astonishingly bad book. I shudder at the thought of legions of business school students being exposed to this pablum ever year. What a colossal waste of time and resources.I'd rather gargle dog vomit than read this book again."
2,Great title - terrible execution.,This book reads more like fiction where the main character gets to porclaim how smart and clever they are. It reads kind of like that joke teller who forgets the punch line - but expects you to trust how funny it was AND laugh.The team pyramid concepts are probably good - I wouldn't know though the book really doesn't dive into them in a useful manner.
5,Great!,The book was in great condition. The product was shipped in time for school and I was happy with my purchase
3,"It was like watching a ""b"" movie","First takeaway from this book was the simplistic and ""silly"" fable story telling process. If it was a movie, it would star a bunch of B actors and a low budget. The principles of leadership were fine, but the process of which the author tries to get his point across is just a bit too shallow.Second takeaway, my guess is that this ""fable"" fad with ""who moved my cheese"" and the ""fish"" books seems to have run it's course, thankfully.Obviously, I'm not a big fan"
3,"Good information, but a little too trite","The author has great information to share, but takes the allegorical device a little too far. It is easy to read, but the ""cuteness"" took away from the message. It is a decent primer for the issues that cause teams to break down, but the fixes are a little utopian."
5,An easy & excellent read,"I really enjoyed reading this book and gleaned valuable knowledge from it in a very quick time. I'm a ""slow reader"" but Lencioni's ""fable"" format and short chapters allowed me to finish this book in about 1 1/2 days. Along with its companion book (Overcoming the Five Dysfunctions...), this book has provided me - and my coworkers whom I train - with the tools necessary to really make teams work and flourish. I appreciate that the author pulls no punches about the difficulty and reality of team building yet posits examples of the effectiveness of the consistent application of the principles he espouses."
5,Lost order,Very good service from Amazon to replace an order that had been lost between the USA and Belgium.Much appreciated.DL
4,Great Book,"A lot of info packed into a small book. I love the fable approach, it makes for easier understanding. This book took no more than 2 days to read. Definitley worth your time."
3,Quick Read,"It's a quick, easy read. The book is based around a pyramid explaining the key elements of teaming. The author uses a fictional team to implement those elements, but at times the book is a little too simplistic. The key elements are insightful and pragmatic. I will be passing it on to co-workers who work on team projects because the advice bears repeating."
1,Horribly contrived; of little practical use,"While other reviewers find this book to be a rewarding guide to team building and leadership, I have found that its incredibly poor and contrived prose led it to be virtually unreadable.The book contains no extraordinary revelations, although it does organize a few obvious tenets of effective teams. The fictitious team in the book is so unrealistic and the dialogue so poorly contrived that the whole piece reads like a bizarre amalgamation of a manifesto on corporate jargon and a fifth graders office drama. Any value in the content of the book was erased by the onslaught of cliches, the substitution of hastily sketched caricatures for realistic characters, and the overly chipper tone that one associates with a Public Service Announcement for the Department of Transportaton, rather than a legitimate piece of written work."
2,Too Formulaic,Predictable and formulaic almost to the point of being trite. There is a lesson to be learned but presented in a very basic manner.
5,Great book,"I had to buy this for required reading at my job. I really got into it. It was well written and easy to understand.The copy I bought was listed as used; however, it looked in brand new condition to me.I would recommend the book to anyone who works in a business environment"
3,Oversimplifies a complex issue,"Oversimplifies a complex issue !Although it is easy to read, underestimates many important aspects in the process of forming and maintaining motivated and productive teams."
4,Good read!,The book is a quick read and easy to follow. The lessons learned are important ones to consider from a management perspective. The author makes his points and supports them with a somewhat realistic story in support of those points.
4,A must read,"It's not that The Five Dysfunctions of a Team by Patrick Lencioni provides any new aspects to team building....wait, there's more...it's not that Lencioni provides any new aspects, yet it's the clarity and simplicity with which the material is presented that makes this book a must-read.[...]"
5,5 stars,"The book we ordered ""Five Dysfunctions"" was in excellent shape and arrived via mail quickly. I would definitely order from you again."
5,bgdglvr23,"Loved this book and the characters in it, the story was spot on. I am very partial to this author and have many of his books, all of which are well written, easy to read and turn on the light bulb for me. These are fun books to read about work related subjects and the story telling ability of the author make it delightfully fun. You want to get to the end of the book, then you're sorry it is over and you pick up another to read. Highly recommended. FAST READ"
4,Staff & Management,Book gave in story form and then followed up with it's theories. Good way to get point across. Even staff not in managment seemed to embrace it.
5,A Must Read for Team Success,Do you want to overcome poor team dynamics to enjoy success and enjoy coming into work? Have everyone on your team read this book.
3,Great inspiring leadership book,"Wonderful and inspiring book. I also would recommend the newly published, ""Running with the Rhinos"" as well for good companion book.Running with the Rhinos: Courageous Leadership for a Complex World"
5,Very Impressed,Very surprised how good this book actually was. I couldn't put it down and I'm not a big reader!!! Can't wait to try this out with my team!!
5,Excellent,This book was one of the most insightful management books I have ever read. It was such an easy read with very specific examples. We have put this to use in my company and are seeing a huge difference in our ability to work together.
3,You need to search to find the nuggets,"I read this book for my graduate class in orgainizational behavior. The book has some good nuggets that can easily be applied to any inter-personal situation, and is an easy read. My complaint about the book: I didn't like how the author treats the reader as less-than-intelligent. Throughout the book we are told ""but that was nothing compared to what happened next."" This book isn't exactly a crime novel, so I don't think we need to be told every other page that something unexpected is coming up. Plus, we can determine that for ourselves from the context of the narration. This style of story telling can be very grating, and distracts from the lesson that the story is trying to make."
3,Good Parabole,"This book will orientate you the things you have to deal when you are in power position, however I think this is an Introductory book of the art of relationships. Most people would agree that the book is a little superficial and is not very good guide for pros. I will recomended to beginers in management."
4,Solid message with a contrived storyline,"Much of this book is told through a fable (author's words, not mine) about an aging CEO who joins a young company to build a functioning team. If you can get past the overly-contrived story, you'll be rewarded with a solid message which is stated in concrete terms in the last section of the book. For many folks, the last couple dozen pages are all that's required. But I don't think that book would sell. The author sets up the message with a fictional account that reads quickly. If it all seems a bit set-up, that's because it is."
1,A True Fable,A fable is a make-believe story and this author insults the intelligence of the reader by pretending to present an adult story about adult lives. The narrative destroyed the message of what could have been true guidance.
1,Fictitious P.O.S. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND MOVE ON!,"It's easy to say that there are 5 dysfunctions of a team in a business conetext, especially when you make up that business context. I wish I could take the time back I wasted readingthis book. This book is a COMPLETE waste of time!!! DON'T BUY IT!!!!!!!! The book follows a fictitious CEO, and her wildly unbelievable executive board through an equally unbelievable sequence of made up events. THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH THIS BOOK IS THAT THERE ARE NO REAL PEOPLE AND NO REAL MONEY INVOLVED."
3,Surprised Again!,"I bought this book in an effort to learn more about my least favorite NBA franchise--the Los Angeles Lakers. Unfortunately, the five dysfunctions of the title are not the starting five for the NBA runner-ups. Instead, it's some kind of business leadership book and pretty good, actually. I replaced the cover with a picture of a smiling Kobe Bryant and placed it prominently on my bookshelf next to my favorite James Carlos Blake novel. Another fine mistake."
3,Rather simplistic view of complex phenomena...,"While there is nothing wrong with the material presented, one cannot believe this is all there is to it.Making Teams work involves a considerable investment of time and energy, and also depends on the circumstances. Under pressure of an immediate threat - even adversaries can band together into a tight cohesive team. When such threats are gone - they fall back to natural behaviors, and dysfunction can set it.The 5 dysfunctions - Absence of Trust, Fear of Conflict, Lack of Commitment, Avoidance of Accountability, and Inattention to Results - these are only the basics.There are other important factors that make teams function or dysfunction, 3 of which are:Common and time bound goalsMutual respectSkill sets to get the job done...Enjoy the book - it is an easy read, but keep in mind there is more to making teams work effectively!"
5,The Five Dysfunctions of a Team,"Excellent, practical book that is a ""must read"" for anyone that works with groups of people."
5,Golden Nuggets to Help Team Leaders,"What a wonderful fable about building extraordinary teams! A quick read on the surface, there are some golden nuggets of ideas to help leaders rescue their teams from the morass of dysfuction:1. Absence of Trust. Team members lack confidence in each others abilities and intentions.2. Fear of Conflict. Teams avoid conflict and are unwilling to discuss and resolve issues to produce the best possible solution in the shortest period of time.3. Lack of Commitment. Teams are unable to make clear and timely decisions and move forward with complete buy-in from every member of the team, even those who voted against the decision.4. Avoidance of Accountability. Unwillingness of team membes to call their peers on performance or behaviors that might hurt the team.5. Inattention to Results. Tendency of members to care about someting other than the collective goals of the group.If your team has one of these dysfunctions, your team may want to read this book!"
4,It is told in an,"If you are a technologist, like I am, read this book before your CEO gives you a copy - like mine did! Before I get started, these are the five team dysfunctions that Mr. Lencioni uses in his leadership fable:1. Absence of Trust2. Fear of Conflict3. Lack of Commitment4. Avoidance of Accountability5. Inattention to DetailThroughout my 35 years of working on teams at the leading - bleeding - edge of technology, I have experienced some or all of these in companies and projects. In fact, after reading the book, I realized that my actions had caused and fostered many of these dysfunctions. This book points out not only the attributes of each dysfunction but actions to take to mitigate them. It is told in an ""everyman's'"" story format and can be read in one sitting.Please sit down and read this book from cover to cover. Then think about your actions and the actions of the others on your many teams at work, home and in the community. We all have one or more of these issues. (...)"
4,Easy Read,Manager required me to read this book. I was able to read it in about 3 hours and thought it moved at a steady pace. Through the illustrations I was able to learn how teams functions are where things go wrong.Overall I liked the book and would recommend it to others interested in teh subject.
4,"Great Book, EZ buying Process!","I bought this book for a work project, and the book was advertised as being used, with a bent page or two. The book looked flawless when I got it, and the story was very well told, too. An entertaining, informative read that I would recommend for anyone's workgroup."
5,The Five Dysfunctions of a Team: A leadership Fable,This book is an easy read and one that anyone in the business world can relate with at some point in their career.
3,This fable paints a pretty accurate picture of the real world...,My boss suggested this as a reading assignment for our whole team and I'm glad he did. I have benefitted from reading it and have learned to associate certain behaviorial characteristics and leveraged the techniques to create more effective interpersonal relationships and a better winning team environment. Hope you'll agree and enjoy it as well.
5,Great business book on teams,"Patrick Lencioni has written one the most practical and useful books I have read on the subject of team development. The Five Dysfunctions of a team is written in typical Lencioni style, teaching the concepts through an engaging and easy to read parable. He covers the stages a team goes through as it develops: to build trust, healthy conflict, commitment, accountability, and to achieve common objectives. And it provides an explanation of why some teams get stuck as well as ideas for what to do to support their journey. This is a great book for anyone who is in a position to lead a team or who is member of a team who wants to help their team."
5,Fantastic Job,Lencioni rocked my managing world. This fictional tale illustrates the reality behind team efforts. It opened my eyes to a new world on cooperating. I heartily reccommend that you read this.
4,Solid team building principles,"The only reason I wouldn't give the book a five star rating is that the story got to be somewhat tedious and more empiricle data supporting the team building process would have been reassuring. Nonetheless, I found the book to be quite helpful and informative. It has prompted our senior management team to re-evaluate our interactions and we will be creating processes to enhance our future management interactions. I think any senior management team would benefit from the lessons contained in this book and I do highly recommend it!"
4,Excellent book for team building,"This is an excellent book on true team building. I have been a part of ropes courses and other team building activities. In my opinion, they are lots of fun, but in the end do little to actually build team. This book gives a practical and accessible guide for being able to build effective teams, and teams that work within the unique structure of the organization that you might be in. Principled and not necessarily prescriptive, there are many concepts and ideas that can be gleaned to make more effective teams within your organization. I also enjoyed the story style of presenting the concepts as they gave a real world environment in which to see the concepts played out. Excellent resource."
4,Dysfunctions,This books was interesting to me as I am part of a seven member team that suffers at times from inaction. This pointed out things that could help me in the future.
5,The Five Dysfunctions of a Team,Excellent book; I could not put it down! There were many applications to professional and personal life.
3,A good book for new team leaders,"The Five Dysfunctions can be read in a weekend. Lencioni's storytelling method engages the reader and allows the reader to buy into his advice in a more enjoyable manner than would dry text. As the book nears its ending, Lencioni makes his points well and offers excellent advice on how a team can use the new knowledge of the five dysfunctions to improve the team's performance.I've seen his characterization of the five dysfunctions in numerous team settings, and if his solutions are as spot-on as his analysis, then this should indeed be very useful book."
4,great book,"What a great book. I'm a consultant specializing in leadership development at the management level. This is a must read for anyone who works on a team in corporate America. You will see an uncanny resemblance of the characters in the fable, to the people in your own company. Informative, engaging and a quick read. For the corporate trainers who might read this review, there is a very good program that Lencioni developed to help you present this material in your company. Jean Kelley"
2,Mediocre book,Team is dysfunctional - Team hires new CEO - Team goes on offsite - Team is honest in feedback - team is energized - And they live happily ever after. Felt more like a Enid Blyton novel. I was expecting management advice in Ken Blanchard style. Disappointed.
3,The challenges of team building,"""The Five Dysfunctions of a Team"" by Patrick Lencioni is a fast and interesting read. Lencioni employs the now-common fable format to illustrate the challenges and hard work required to build effective teams. Those well versed in team building will find little in the book that is unfamiliar. The substance of the book, which is contained in the last section of the text, requires no more than an article to convey. The impression I got is that the author employed the story format to stretch the text into a book-length manuscript. Nonetheless, the book can be helpful to those inexperienced with team building. The book's greatest value is in its portrayal of the commitment needed to create a functioning team."
5,The Five Disfunctions of a Team: A Leadership Fable,"This is an amazing product. The book has so much to offer in terms of real leadership that I can't put it down after opening the first page. All that the book offers is immediately applicable at the next staff meeting and it produces positive results.I was assigned the task of trying to find out why our team is not working in harmony and after reading this book, I had so many ideas how to motivate everyone, my boss was surprised. When I told him where all this came from, he bought himself the book and suggested that all staff must read it. In fact, he made it mandatory that staff produce a copy of the book with our next meeting.Couldn't have made a better choice of improving my leadership skills.Thank you."
4,The 5 Dysfunctions,"This book is not revolutionary or revealing of any ancient chinese secrets. It does, however, help bring to mind some key prinicples that are lacking in today's business cultures. These key principles are values that should have been taught in the home, but instead are left to the workplace to instill. I rated this book 4 stars because I thought it showed accountability in poor decisions made by the new CEO and it also showed a willingness to go through an uncomfortable period to resolve the issues of the team, promote creativity, and foster accountability -- even when the outcome is not what she thought it would or should be. This book was a very quick read and provided talking points that foster open dialogue."
2,Fable or Research? Which Should Be the Basis For Your Management Decisions?,"Although this book contains some good ideas, it is not based on research on teams. Some of its suggestions have even been proven wrong. Instead of this book, I highly recommend Richard Hackman's ""Leading Teams,"" which is based on decades of research, is very readable (no academic jargon), immensely practical (especially if you use some of the free tools he offers on his website), and won the best book of the year award from the Academy of Management."
2,Narrative account gives to much credence to biased sources,"Davis's book seeks to make the history of the events of 1741 more engaging by presenting them in a sort of narrative form. Unfortunately, this method does not allow for the necessary critical analysis. The major resource available to historians studying these events is a journal of the proceedings written by one of the judges in the case, and he wrote his journal for the explicit purpose of defending the proceedings against criticism. While Davis shows some skepticism in his handling of the sources, making the history into a narrative forced Davis to take his biased source a little too much at its word. Nonetheless, it is a fascinating subject and well worth exploring."
3,Would be Great if it Rocked More,"This CD has a great heavy sound I would say the heaviest of all their CD's up to this one. I only wish it rocked more to make use of it. There are far too many mellow moments with acoustic guitar and keyboard which just drag the cd down. I enjoy Savatages mellow moments as it is part of what they do but there are far far too many. Highlights for me are the first three and 'Nothin Going On'. POTN, HOTMK & GB are their CD's to get still if you want a more rocking Savatage. Zak is a good singer but Jon still is the main man."
4,GOD BLESS AMERICA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is CD is awsome. It gets a little heavy at times but it is still a very good album altogether. ""Chance"" is incredible. The operatic second part is so cool. The reason I am writing this is to talk about ""Alone You Breathe."" This is a stirring tribute to Criss Olivia. After all tha happened on Tuesday the 11th I found a new meaning for the song. The speaker could be any relative of the victims. Where he is singing ""You threw it all away. . . "" I figured that could be the relative yelling at the terrorists. The song fits very well to all the emotion experienced by so many people. everyone should buy this CD. Oh Yeah, GOD BLESS AMERICA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Alittle Flat.....But Enjoyable,"""Handful Of Rain"" sounds very similar to ""Edge Of Thorns"", but it's not as heavy. It's more of a softer version, with the same direction....It's very good, but it's just not quite as memorable as ""EOT"". One thing this CD does do, is it brings out many emotions. It's very sad, and very touching at times. The only problem with this is that nothing really stands out. It's solid, it's just not as heavy as I would prefer....Those of you who enjoy the more ""generic style"" new Savatage, will enjoy this. I personally prefer the older stuff....SAVATAGE RULES!!!!"
5,Wow,"It's a pity I waited as long as I did to pick this one up. There's not a lot new I can say, Zak is great and the emotion Jon wrote with after his brothers death is heartbreaking. The title track is worth of note above the rest of this great album. The same goes for ""Alone You Breath"" Jon's tribute to the fallen and ""Chance"" which belongs on everyone's list of greatest songs ever. Buy it now."
1,Alex Solnick disappoints,"Given what Alex did on guitar with Testament, particulary on ""Practice what you preach""; I was expecting something more exciting and vigorating, especially without being in the confines in a Thrash metal group.What I heard was standard, boring, repetitive guitar work, that matched with the song materialJust another example how the late Chris Oliva was Savatage's greatest asset in terms of both songwriting and guitar playing"
3,"Intense, but melodically lacking.","After guitarist Criss Oliva's fatal car crash, a guitarist from crunch-metal outfit Testament took over for this album. The result is a heavier sound which pleases the headbangers but buries the melodic appeal that characterized ""Edge of Thorns.""This is most evident on ""Taunting Cobras"" and ""Nothing's Going on,"" both of which get skipped every time I throw this CD in. But the harder sensibility permeates most of the tracks, and the interplay of piano and guitar that lights up other albums gets lost.Still, it's a worthy CD for a Savatage fan, especially if you're more into heavier music. ""Chance"" is the song that got me into Savatage in the first place, ""Alone you breathe"" is a heartbreaking epic, and ""Watching you fall,"" ""Castles Burning,"" and ""Symmetry"" are powerful if same-sounding.In short, Savatage at only decent bests any MTV-metal act at their best. But if you don't have Magellan or Dead Winter Dead, get those first."
3,Those were the days.,"During a time in which I listened mostly to ""Ministry"" and the ""Red Hot Chili peppers"", I still squeezed in a little ""Jesus Jones"". I have to admit, this is an album that I only play once or twice a year, but once it's in I love it. I really think this is better than most people think it is. The songs ""International Bright Young Thing"" and ""Real, Real, Real"" are just a couple songs on a mostly good album. Any fan of ""The Soup Dragons"" or ""Happy Mondays"" should like ""Doubt"". If nothing else, it's fun to crank ""Right Here, Right Now"", and pretend it's the early 90's again."
3,Jesus Jones goes mainstream,"Mike Edwards is by far the most creative European musician to be named after David Bowie. ""Doubt"" is Mike E going more mainstream. You can find their infamous smash hit ""Right here, right now"" on it. When their first album ""Liquidizer"" was released the critics considered it as one of the best debut albums for years. ""Doubt"" is never out of time and it should never be missed on a party. If you're just not into mainstream like me, then check their 3rd album out, named ""Perverse"". Their latest record so far ""Already"" is awesome too. www.jesusjones.com"
4,"Great CD, but Not Their Best","I love Jesus Jones, and I love this CD, but I have to agree -- Liquidizer (their first) and Perverse (their third) are sooo much better (Try Idiot Stare full blast as you scream down the highway and you'll see what I mean). I'm more of a rock and electronica fan than a pop fan and Doubt moved away from the rockiness of Liquidizer -- Doubt is a fantastic album -- and I'm pleased to see that others hold International Bright Young Thing as their fave from this one, it's mine, too -- but I was ecstatic when Perverse came out and Jesus Jones moved from popiness to a more techno sound.Or better yet, buy their new one London and go see them when they tour! See you there. :-)"
4,Whoa!,"I don't get the reviewers who rip this CD. If you were alive and well back in 90-91 when it was released, it really was something fresh; something different than the drivel on the radio. (Drivel on the radio- some things never change.)Is it a ""timeless"" album or a ""best of all time"" album? No. But way back in those early days, it was cutting edge.How strange it is that the members of Jesus Jones fell so far, so fast. From best selling album, to having their song on a mini-van commercial. I understand one of the former members of the band is working in a record store in England. Whew!"
1,The mind boggles,"I would like to think that this CD ""usually ships within 24 hours"" because Capitol Records grossly misjudged its shelf life. It pains me to think that this CD may actually still be in print. This album contains 1991's ubiquitous semi-hit ""Right Here Right Now"", and not much else. Not much, other than the angry, creepy elf-face on the cover. If angry, creepy elf-faces are your thing, then this is probably the CD for you. But if you just can't live without ""Right Here, Right Now,"" I suggest you try Napster. And try to get out a bit more."
1,"it's not right here, right now","The best song is 'right here, right now' and that was only a half-way decent song. The majority of songs don't really sound like their major mtv hit and I would not even purchase this cd used if I had the choice again."
2,Average&catchy at the time,"Right Here,Right now made Jesus Jones the Aha! of the 90's.in fact the sounds almost remind me of Aha! a bit.now Jesus Jones had a Mini-Influence on other Artists.for instance U2's The Fly Song sounds alot Like Jesus Jones.Overall not much happens here it was a time Period kind of Album."
1,"not here, not now","Made the mistake of spending $1.00 on this in a used store.""Hmmm, they made 'Right Here, Right Now', bound to be another decent song on the disc"".Nope.DO NOT buy this album if you like ""Right Here, Right Now"" unless you also like the sound of your own money flushing down the toilet. If Prince and Yanni had a love child, and that child was somehow not ugly enough to be shunned by all who see him, even he would not make music as horrible as this. It's like Lou Reed voiced over Ministry, minus the heroin and/or talent.Not even for 0.33 plus shipping, people."
3,Not quite that bad...,"Well, I used to own this CD. You can find it in many used CD racks, which is where my copy probably ended up. Though I grew out of the music, it is a good CD. Everyone has heard ""Right Here, Right Now"" but for fans of the same catchy, straight ahead sound there are other songs (Real, Real, Real and others) that make the album a worthwhile buy. If you see it selling used, give it a try."
3,Better used,"Probably the most famous album by Jesus Jones... It's probably better buying an used one. Most of the songs are upbeat and colorful, my favorite being ""Int'l Bright Young Thing."" I don't know why ""Perverse"" is not listed in Amazon, but combined with ""Liquidizer"" and ""Perverse,"" you will be able to fill an MD (or CD-R) with some good tunes. However, you have to like their style. It's not for everyone, but if you are curious what Jesus Jones sounds like, this is the one to get. This is probably a bit more polished than other albums and also more ""radio-friendly."""
3,good old-school alt. rock,"This album is one of the first alternative albums to reach the mainstream. This album was created around 1990-1991, right at the end of the New Wave movement and at the birth of the Alternative Rock movement. The beat and some synthetics reveal its New Wave roots, but the sound matches other Alternative pioneers, i.e. Dada. The CD itself is a mixed bag. I would say, if you have money to burn, buy it, but I'd wait until I saw it on a discount rack. who?where?why?, international bright young thing, right here right now (of course) are great songs. There are, however, mediocre songs and bad songs on here. Worth buying, not worth full price."
5,Had to search for this.. Amazon to the rescue!,"Got hooked on this item and the local stores took it off the market. It is not as salty as other Taco mixes. Kraft(who makes it) told me to check Amazon. And your price was the better of the 2 options I was given.Great item & great price= win, win!"
2,Moral messages overpower storyline.,"In her effort to combine two mythical figures from distant cultures, Sneve has allowed the moralizing of each to overpower what could be an interesting storyline. The detailed descriptions of both Norway and the Plains area of the western United States are intriguing. The cursury descriptions of the indigenous people (especially the Lakota) limit the readers' connection to the people thmeselves. The story seems to exist simply to give a moral value, not to present an interesting story about the two cultures."
4,Fun book,"Cute story, good characters and excellent writing. This is a book that will hold the attention of most readers - young and old."
4,A good place to start with Eager,"...This is a simple little tale of a group of children who discover a little bit of magic in an old toy soldier. In Eager's work, magic has fairly strict rules (in _Half-Magic_, the charm granted any wish--but only in halves), and here the rules work as a kind of companion to the idea that magic can only work if you continue to believe in it (that is, if you start to think of the creatures you are interacting with simply as dolls, they revert to being dolls again). The plot achieves its urgency through a possible problem in the family, but, with a little help, everything can be solved. A little more moralistic and straight-forward than some of his others, but well worth reading--especially if you've never tried Eager before."
5,Knights Castle,"The Knight's Castle is a fabulous book for many reasons. One becuase it is a fantasy book which takes you through the Middle Ages. In this book there are two kids and there cousins. And there Dad or Uncle you could say, is suffering from a disease. And they are offered a wish, and they wish that there Dad or Uncle would get better. They have to earn there wish by going back in time of the time of Ivanhoe and Robin Hood and Ivanhoe, and completing a mission."
3,general pershing,"Despite the author's atrocious writing- sometimes I had to read and reread sentences several times over to understand them- General Pershing's strength, determination and character shine through. I felt uplifted and inspired. In short, learning about this giant of a man was inspiring but the writing got in the way."
3,"Solid, not great. Would Like More Detail.","The book is not as bad as the one star reveiw, but not great either. It's a good introductory biography of Pershing. I would have liked more detail, both into his military career and the effects of losing his family. It was heartbreaking to read about his wife and 3 of his 4 children dying in the Presidio fire."
4,"A good book with an ""extended ending.""","Smith's style of writing can be hard to get used to, but when that is done, it is easy reading and very interesting. I knew nothing about J.J. Pershing except his nick name and that he was an American general before I ordered this book (and I considered myself a fairly well rounded student of American history). This book was a great addition to my collection of history books.I must admit that I was a bit upset about the ending (there wasn't one, I thought, when there should have been), when the book extended through the lives of the later generations of the Pershing family. However, when I was done completely with the book I saw the author's reasoning behind it all I think. It left a profound feeling of ""so that's what has come of the great Pershing line,"" in me, probably because I am interested in geneology as well (both mine and famous people). I recommend the book very much, to any history or geneology buff."
3,im confused,"i dont understand why he writes this kind of music. its good, but in another time maybe. i dont think anyone should really ignore the past 300 years of music. maybe if it was stylized in a more modern fashion---- like arvo part, who takes renaissance music and concepts in the context of now. i think that is more effective than merely looking back and completely adopting that old form.either way, it sounds good."
1,A Handel wannabe?,"I recall a trip to Key West to see the home of Hemingway. The tour group leader was a Hemingway clone...white beard...tough machismo style..short cropped machise hairdoo. Went down to the pub, Sloppy Joes, it was full of Hemm's... all sporting the beard, the cropped white hair, the macho indifference to the steamy heat.Now it comes, many moons later I buy this CD... and... what do my ears hear here? It's Georg Friedrich Handel...in the late 20th century. Sometimes it even drifts into Telemann... or a bit-o-Bach. It sure as hell isn't original.What does composition in this era bring to music? To the art and the Philosphy of music? Sure it sounds ok... but it is imitative. I'd far rather have bet on something John Adams just hatched...or something asian. Omigod...there it goes now into a movement from the Messiah. Middle of summer, and I'm listening to a wannabe Handel copying Messiah."
1,"As a Sicilian, I Had High Hopes for This Book, But...","If you know nothing of Sicilian language, this book may help you pick up a little vocabulary. But as a Sicilian, and as a professional editor for 5 years, I have to say that I wouldn't look to this book for any definitive answer to anything.There are typos everywhere you look, not to mention layout and formatting issues. Was an editor or proofreader -- or ANYONE -- ever employed to read this before it went to press? I'd be mortified as the author to see a book of mine published with such a disregard for content and style -- particularly since it's an educational book, and a language book to boot.You may get some benefit from this book, simply because I have never seen another book on Sicilian out there, but that's where my recommendation stops."
2,"Poor Structure, Editing, but Good Info","If one has an interest in learning Sicilian, this book is a good toolbox of info. However, like any real toolbox, the tools are so cluttered and spread out that one needs to know what you're looking for and how to use it before he even opens it. There is no index in this book, and the table of contents merely has lesson titles (like ""At the Airport"") and doesn't tell one where to find grammatical info. One should not only KNOW another language before using this book, but one should know how to LEARN another language (parts of speech, &c.;) before diving in. If you know what you're looking for, it's altogether good.I don't know of any other Sicilian grammars, and thinking that this could be the best available in English frightens me. If I were a Sicilian, I'd be embarassed."
1,"Maybe enjoyable for a literature buff, NOT for a dog lover","I will admit, I may not be suitable to write a review: I only read half the book. By that point, I had my fill of short, dark stories that were not about dogs at all, they only used them as a plot device. In fact, in many of these stories, being a plot device is a far less terrible fate. Dogs are shot, trapped, beaten and drowned. How anyone who truly loves dogs could read this is beyond me."
1,So sorry I read it,"I wanted to be entertained but instead I was disappointed as a dog lover, and a lover of the short story. I continued to read the book because I couldn't believe it could be that bad. If you like dogs, don't waste your time. If you like short stories, ditto."
3,Definately not Terhune or Knight,"OK book, but if you're a lover of dog stories, especially ones by Terhune (the master!) and Lassie Come Home and such, you may not like this one. Sometimes the dogs have very little to do with the story. Usually they're not the hero dogs that Terhune and Knight wrote about."
5,"Two for Stew, a book made for two to curl up to.","This book is wonderful, after 6 years it is still my daughter's (now 9) favorite book. She checks it out from her school library so often I finally bought it for her and she now reads it to her little sister, the same way I read it to her, curled up on the couch."
4,Scary stories... yes indeed!,WOW! I got this book for x-mas and now I can safely say I am done reading it. The whole thing. This book is filled with 365 scary tales... the longest tale in the book I believe only comes to 2 pages (font and back). So there not long stories at all. All by differnt authors of short stories. No big names in here but definatly writers with talent. A must buy and read on a lonely stormy night or at a camp fire!
5,Short fiction fun!,I got this book because Devon Monk has a short fiction piece in it. Wonderful and fun (scary) reads!
5,Excellent supplement,"This is the best Calcium/Magnesium supplement I've ever taken. I try lots of brands before choosing the best & this is THE BEST! I recently had blood work showing several deficiencies of vitamins and minerals, which may be due to my age. This brand gets into my system quicker than others I've tried. I highly recommend this product and normally I don't write reviews. I had to let others know about this high quality product."
1,Disappointed,"This book must be for seminary students. My sister and I could not read it. Enjoyed Armegeddon, Oil and the Middle East, easy for lay persons to understand."
2,The Rapture Leaves the Bible behind,"A valiant effort accompanied this deeply flawed work on ""the rapture."" What the book fails to delineate well are the good reasons why belief in the rapture was not accepted by most theologians in the history of Christianity. Most of what is discussed today about the rapture relies on poor exegesis rightly rejected by most Christian theologians.For this reader, the decisive argument against the rapture is by David Currie, who believes in the Second Coming and is no liberal exegete. Read his, Rapture: The End-Times Error That Leaves the Bible Behind. Currie's work is superior and is more in line with historical Christianity than this aberration mostly promoted in the United States."
5,A Pre-Tribulationist Classic,"This book is the most extensive pre-trib treatment available regarding the issues surrounding the timing of the rapture of the church as described in I Thess. 4. Walvoord is thorough, charitable, and persuasive. This expanded edition includes direct responses to the novel dispensational post-trib position of Robert Gundry. The author does not dodge Gundry's issues, but answers them in point-by-point fashion (while raising some formidable issues of his own against Gundry's assertions). If you've read Gundry, and find yourself swayed by his arguments in favor of a post-trib rapture, then you owe it to yourself to read this book before making any decision on the matter. Hear what BOTH sides have to say. You may be quite surprised at the veracity of pre-tribulationism in the able hand of Walvoord. I highly recommend the book."
3,have no clue how to use this!,"well this is a really neat gift idea..however I tried to add a few pics to it before i gave it to my sister for xmas, & I downloaded the CD...well then when i connected the keychain it said ""could not connect. sO i Called brookstone, who does not have any tech support, and they told me the only time you should use the CD was if you have anything less than XP...well I have XP. this whole thing is just not user friendly...so if anyone has any IDEA how to use this thig will you PLEASE let me know??? thanks much !"
2,Software/Interface is Shaky,"I purchased one as a gift for my father-in-law. When I would use the software to download pictures to the device, the software would often just terminate and I'd find myself back at my Windows desktop screen. It doesn't happen on all photo folders and I can't understand why it does it on some folders, but not others. Brookstone has no real support for the software either. Took me hours to download 60 pictures to the device."
1,Nothing but trouble. This device doesn't work.,"The software for this device is awful. The manufacturer really needs to get on the ball and resolve these issues. The installation program keeps looking for drivers that are not on my system. I found several missing files by searching the internet but it was an excessive amount of work. The program still does not function correctly and causes our computer to crash. My wife is in tears, this was a Christmas gift from her sister."
2,bad,"Got it for grandpa, spent an hour setting it up. And it worked while connected to computer and outlet. but the power button didn't work. So when I went to turn it on it would not do anything.Then I had a second one, and my computer kept flashing warning signs and checking for viruses on an unsafe device. I just don't trust it and will be returning them both very shortly."
5,Elvis sings new and songs he has sung before on this cd.,"The first two songs are on this cd was not recored for RCA (but they are on here anyways). The songs are That's All Right and Baby, Let's Play House. Elvis recored those songs for Sun Studios.Heartbreak Hotel is on this too. And it's mostly on his other cds (But not on Christmas cd). It whould be odd if you bought any Elvis Presley cd and Heartbreak Hotel was not on it.There are aslo rare songs that on this cd, like In The Ghetto, Little Sister, Can't Help Falling In Love, and Polk Salad Annie. Aslo on this cd is Burning Love and It Hurts Me.If you know somebody that doesn't have this cd and it is a big Elvis fan. There you go."
1,Long Time Fan,Here we go again. BMG has issued yet another useless product. The same songs over and over again. This time an edited version of Artist of the Century Cd. While BMG keeps allowing alternate takes and unreleased material to be issued in Denmark and other European countries. We in the U.S. get the junk at high prices. Poor compilations of old material issued to death. BMG does not concider the U.S. fan to be important enough to release a fresh and creative product to. Elvis was better than this and the U.S. fan is too. Only a handful of good CD's have been issued in the last two years here in the states. Who ever picks the material for these projects should be replaced with someone that knows more about Elvis and his legacy in music and what the U.S. fan wants.
3,"Right topic, wrong treatment","This book purports to be a ""how-not-to"" guide to errors in writing and speaking, but could just as easily be written in list form. While the author highlights a number of errors we should all try to avoid, the book is short on grammar rules. In fact, chapters in which a grammar rule is stated outright are few and far between. Moreover, quite a few of the chapters are on very petty ""mistakes,"" which other works, such as The Merriam-Webster Dictionary of English Usage, do not treat as errors. As it is, the book comes across more as a rant against people who do not speak and write as ""the grouchy grammarian"" speaks and writes, and his style is seemingly quite terse.Still, the book should be required reading for all English and journalism majors in colleges and those people already working in related fields. A good grammar book and a dictionary of English usage would be complementary."
3,Dusting off cobwebs,Very particular. Sometimes I didn't understand the point the author was trying to make. I guess I need that. Good explanations.
3,Very Good,"This was a very up tempo CD, that could be listened to while cooking or or just driving along the freeway.....gave as gifts to friends and family and got great reviews.This was a first buying under this radio station, I usually buy the KKSF from San Franciso radio station , however this year they did not make a annual Aids Relief CD. The Station from Chicago where this CD is from did a very good job and I will probably look on line for more music from them in the future...Mary Terese,San Jose,CA."
1,This starling should fly away!,If you like indie or pop music that is fresh and exciting DO NOT buy this cd.This is worse than water torture.
2,there were actually 2 releases to this album,"one being european and the other in the U.S....and of course the U.S version being the watered down 1 so you arent going to get the songs that were otherwise intended for the version your looking for ,unless of course thats the version you were looking for"
1,not the original,"a fair warning to everyone who is thinking of buying this cd as a complement their LP-collection of Tosh music. They have added some songs which were not on the original LP, and removed some of the best songs that were on the LP. Where is ""Bumbo klaat"" and ""Guide me from my friends""?? Two strong tracks which were among my favorites on the LP. This is bad, very bad. Im not gonna buy it."
5,A legend of an artist,"In an age where music is base on how attractive the artist is and the sales of their album, instead of the quality and the richness of the artist's work. I have been force to look for good music by doing research on my own or by taking older people's advice. During one of my research, I fell upon (and happily so) Peter Tosh's work. Peter Tosh was one of the giants of reggae music. He deserves the same credit as Bob Marley, but because he was so militant, he doesn't get the same recognition. While Bob Marley was M.L. King Jr., Peter Tosh was Malcolm X. As an artist, he was so deep and his words were so challenging and yet soulful. I found myself not only trying to figure him out (which I haven't), but I found myself trying to figure out who I am. That's how powerful he was...he made you think and feel. If you are a reggae fan or a person who is disgusted with today's music, try ""Wanted Dread & Alive"". You will want to hear more and more from this great artist."
3,Toshiba e750,"The Toshiba 75x has an impressive array of features and the dual card support is extremely important as you can use the SD slot for memory and the CF slot for more unique expansion cards. On the surface the unit has extreme promise. Unfortunately Toshiba support is maddening. Be very sure you are happy with what you get, because history (e740) is that it will never change. Toshiba's standard fix is to come out with a new unit and drop early adopters like a rock. A prospective buyer owes it to himself or herself to take a look at some of the PDA user groups before purchase."
5,Wifi star,"I haven't used the iPaq 5450 with wifi so I don't know about that one, but the e750 flies when connected to a 802.11b hotpoint. Since it's built-in, there's no installation, and you just set up the network parameters (SSID, WEP, etc.) and that's it. Works great with your own access point at home as well as public ones. Now that spring is here, my favorite is taking the e750 for lunch break at Bryant Park behind the NYPL."
1,Total waste of money - avoid it like the plague!,"Constant ActiveSync drops, random hard resets, unreadable white text on the Today screen, are only a few of the issues owners of this PDA have to deal with every day... Do yourself a favor, and go get an iPaq or a Dell Axim!"
1,Toshiba product support is poor,"Toshiba's legacy of poor product support continues with this product. With a year invested in ignoring the problems of the e740, Toshiba has failed to support it as a product and is likely to do the same with the e750."
5,"A great study of pain, told through humor","I really applaud and admire the work that Anderson has given us within this bookThe material that Anderson shares with us includes so much of his personal guilt, regret, and sadnessHowever, he manages to share it in a way that is constructive, humorous, and easy to digest ---- he makes it easy to see the screw-ups we've made in our own lives, and helps to suggest ways of alievation, through his own narrationReading this book is almost an exercise in forgivness yourself ---- forgiving those around you and forgiving YOURSELFAnd best of all - it is all told in Anderson's classic humor - making this all very easy to digestAlthough the book is good, I truly recommend the audio version --- Anderson's narration is a perfect complement to a well done bookthank you for reading!"
2,"Informative, but it could have been so much better written","While, this book was informative, it was a chore to read. While chronological, it seemed disjointed and was difficult to finish. I couldn't believe this book won some sort of award and only slogged through it because it was a gift from someone who met the author at a wedding."
2,Not a Gender changer,"This product is not a gender changer. A gender changer typically has either both Male or both Female connectors so when used one is then presented with the opposite connector. This unit when connected to any cable or plug, presents the same interface as the one connected to, NOT a gender changer."
5,Awesome Doo Wop,I have always loved the Doo Wop sound and now I can actually see the stars who performed the music I love.
3,Dr Watts,I just got around to playing this DVD over the holidays.I made the purchase to see only a few of the acts presented . Overall the quality of this program is good compared to some of the others that I have.
4,Metric Architectural Design Standards,"30th edition. This book is an European, metric equivalent of the Architectural Graphic Standards by Ramsey/Sleeper in German except the structural details. It closely resembles the General Planing and Design Data chapter and covers every aspect of architectural design. The German architectural design standards apply to the vast majority of European countries and many other."
5,Why do we suffer?,"Spirituality Without God gives the most comprehensive view on human created suffering. It is written in quite simple language which is easily understood. It is a reference book you will find yourself reading,contemplating and meditating on again and again.The practice pointed to not only gives visible results but allows us to relax in the direct experience of this Non-Dual moment."
1,no thanks,My vet sells these and the dogs like them but there are too many bad ingredients like high fructose corn syrup and BHA to justify feeding these to my fur buddies. Why on earth use corn syrup for dogs when molasses could be used instead and has more nutrients. This is doggy junk food. No thanks.
2,Hard to understand,I read and re-read the whole book but found it very hard to understand what the story is all about.
5,Sweet story!,"I bought this book because of a memory of making tracks in the snow with my own grandfather many years ago. My 2 kids (4 & 6) listened attentively and were in ""suspense"" until the end. They spontaneously repeated the recurring lines with me (""Tracks in the snow, Tracks in the snow, Where did they come from? Where do they go?"") and were tickled by the ending (the girl realizes the tracks are her own). Very sweet, simple story. Recommended!"
5,Incredible!,"This is an excellent way to get in touch with the 70's ... to actually get a feel for where the country was headed then.SNL also changed the way 'stars' were made. The NRFPT players held their own with the studio-made actors, and the industry was never the same again.A great video collection!"
2,SNL First Year,"I was expecting more because I use to watch this program when I was young. Technology has changed so much and you can tell this easily in year one. The cast was in the learning process of what worked and what didn't. It ran some skits into the ground, in my opinion."
3,SNL-EARLY STUFF STILL SU***,"You read that right. The bad outweighs the good in this set. What was funny years ago still holds up but this show in its embryonic stage was loaded almost top heavy with music and various non Not Ready for Prime Time Playersbits and segments like the Muppets and various filmed bits that just aren't that funny. What is cool is seeing the various characters Chevy Chase Newsman,Jaws,etc.. work out the kinks and sometimes literally stumble into regular catch phrases that the popular characters were built around.Nothing is horrible in this set but be warned their are edits including the muting of the N word in one bit and previously mentioned elsewhere editing of title cards used when coming back from commercial breaks. One question is answered by this set. Was I just tired and didn't get the joke originally or does everything after Weekend Update s***. I think it did but buy the set and see for yourself"
5,Hilarious Time Capsule,I have only been able to see minor clips from this early SNL period as I was only 5 when these were on TV...It's great and even more fun to see the news stories they parody. The real treasures are the musical guests...New York always had the cutting edge of music in the 70s and they all showed up on SNL... well worth the price!
2,Chuckles,"Whew boy, I knew that the first season wouldn't be great, but I thought it'd be a lot better than it is. The majority of the skits aren't funny, and at best they produce a chuckle but never a full belly laugh. The worst part are the Albert Brooks and Muppet segments. I hate it when they do a Brooks skit, they are too long and not funny. The same goes for the muppet segments, but they are at least not as bad.However, the cast is great. I enjoy watching John Belushi, Chevy Chase, and the rest. Too bad the writing just isn't good enough. The series does eventually get a lot better, but it is a slow ride through the first season"
4,Love the idea-might hold off on more until Bill Murray signs on,"Having been too young to have seen anything ""live"" prior to 1977, I always wanted such a package to come together. Every season should be treated this way. However, this was clearly the first year and I didn't find that many moments to laugh out loud. I'm a huge Carlin fan and I was disappointed that his monologue was the tame: ""Baseball/Football"". Also too tame was having the Muppets on frequently. I haven't watched them all yet but clearly the worst monologue was a toss-up between Diane Canon and Chevy Chase answering critical viewer mail about how the show is filled with stalls and filler (it is!). This show wouldn't start to roll until Bill Murray rounded out the cast. I won't buy the next set if he's not involved. There's also some guests that I imagine were topical in 1974, but I've never heard of some of them. Robert Klein's obnoxious behavior RUINS the Abba music. SOS!"
1,Didn't arrive,"I was actually disappointed with this because I never received it in the mail, and i tried contacting someone to see why I never got it. And I never got a refund."
2,Had to be there,I thought it would be great to own the first season of SNL. Unfortunately we have not enjoyed it too much so far. We have watched about half of it. The comedy is certainly out of date and perhaps it's just our senses of humor. I had friends over and they enjoyed it more than us. There are some classic moments and perhaps the gang got better as they went along. You would need to think twice before buying this. It's a matter of taste.
3,I Guess It Helped To Be Young And High --,"Have to admit that I've been disappointed so far with this boxed set (I've only seen the first five episodes). I have great memories of watching this show back in the day, but maybe I've also forgotten that the first season wasn't as great as the next few that followed it. I'm disappointed that my initial reaction has been to stare at the TV screen and think to myself ""was this ever funny or have I just lost my sense of humor""?All I can say is, for my money, this set isn't even in the same universe as the DVDs for Second City. If you want a great value for the money, that will make you laugh and remind you that FUNNY REMAINS FUNNY EVEN DECADES LATER, buy any of the SCTV compilations. You don't even need to be high to eat them up and watch them over and over again!"
4,Perfect,Bought this as a gift for my husband who was a teen at this time. It brought back great memories for him.
5,NOT READY FOR PRIME TIME,"IN ALL THE YEARS SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE I BELIEVE THE FIRST 3 SEASONS WERE THE MOST IMPORTAINT STARTING THE CARREERS OF MANY A STAND UP ARTIST, ALSO THE MUSIC, BANDS SINGER SONG WRITERS OF THE TIME I THINK THIS IS REALLY FUN RUMP TO LOOK AT THEM NOW, AND SAYING WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?"
4,Good but I want all of the other years as well...,"It's a bit rough as the show didn't really have it down until year 2, but who wouldn't die laughing at the slumber party skit. Yes it's now been done a zillion times, but watching it with my teenagers was a hoot. You should have seen their faces realizing that their parents watched this when they were teenagers.Just have the remote handy and skip over the stuff that isn't so good. There is plenty here to keep you laughing."
2,Not as funny as I remembered,"Sorry that I bought it, I remembered it being hysterical when I was a kid but when I watched it today it wasn't all that funny."
5,great!,My husband is a huge SNL fan so he was happy to start his SNL collection :) arrived just as described
4,Reliving A Wonderful Time,"We really enjoyed watching the things that we related to so well in 1975. Bringing back memories of the relavant things of the era felt so good, just for a little while we were able to turn back the clock and feel the things that we did when we were going through it the first time. We are so glad they put what we think of are the truly best of Saturday Night Live. Hopefully they will do the same thing for the next few years!"
2,Disappointed In DVD Quality,"Maybe I just got a bad copy, but I had several tape stops where I had to back up and fast foreward....And often at parts I was really interested in.....Also: I'm old enough to have seen these when they were actually live back in the 70's.....I thought they were extremely funny back then....Now I think it was mostly pot that made them seem so much funnier than they actually were. I mean there are some real nuggets, but not as many roll on the ground laughs as I thought there were back in the 70's."
4,Great Service,Great service and on-time delivery. I got the package in time for Christmas. Thanks AAA++
5,"Science H Logic, there is a god!","Finally, bless you Lorne, xoxoxoxxooxoxx....keeep 'em comin', you know they'll sell like hotcakes, or better yet, those little chocolate donuts that are, of course, the breakfast of champions!"
4,SNL Series 1,"Though initial order with new Amazon/Visa card was confusing, DVD set is great and I look forward to getting Season 2."
4,"Not bad, but...","For someone who had never really seen the first season of SNL, this is quite different from what I envisioned. Do not get me wrong: over the whole season there is some fanatastic stuff but what surprises is the fact that it comes over as very diluetd. Diluted by the quantity of music material for examaple: the second show with Paul Simon, while as a usic piece is great, but contains almost no comedy. Also in the beginning it is clear that Chevy Chase was thought to be the next star and not John Belushi. Still, when the comedy is great it is fantastic and is a must-see for everybody. Technically this box set is problematic: while I agree that I have seen better transfers from tape, the image quality is ok but the sound is flat somehow and while I know that TV sound this old may be problematic, this kind of series deserved some optimal restoration."
4,Dated but great for SNL fans,"This book focuses on the early years of SNL, and was written back in the 80s. However, it's still a fun, enjoyable read, especially for fans of the original SNL. I would have given it five stars, but backed up to four only because the material is not current."
2,Very disappointing,"The show was as good as I remember it, but the picture quality and the streaming process were poor enough to make me regret having paid for it. I don't expect to be getting any more of these, although I would definitely purchase them on DVD. Perhaps a better connection than merely a stodgy old DSL line (why, back in my day, we managed just fine with our 300-baud telephone handset modems! And liked it!) would make it palatable, but failing that, don't bother. Youtube videos are better than this."
2,disappointed,"I know this is the originally start of SNL, but I felt the high ratings that I saw before the purchase was really overrated. I didn't believe it was funny and all the Muppet episodes were lame. As the show progressed through the years, it did improve. Many of the scenes that I remember with Gilda Ratner, Chevy Chase, and Jane Curtain happened later in the years that SNL was on and were not included in this set. I can't imagine sitting down and watching these DVD's over and over again."
1,A word of warning,"My sister knew that I loved the first cast of ""Saturday Night Live"" and so she bought this DVD set for me for my birthday. Unfortunately, most of this first season is dreadfully unfunny with only a few nuggets of genius few and far between. We're introduced to Chevy Chase's falling down, Barbara Wawa, the Samurai, the bees, etc. and that's all great, but most of it is odd and experimental; like they don't have the timing and the style quite down yet. I'm waiting for Season 2 or 3. Also, the transfer is less than perfect. There is a slight amount of what looks like artifacting or repeated frames. Not recommended unless you are interested in the early development of the show rather than the classic, familiar work."
5,simply put,"even as high school students when snl premiered,my friends and i knew it was genious.it still is.what's up with all the wordy reviews?"
2,The depths of 1975,"If you want to remember--or learn about--how utterly rotten 1975 was, exhibit A is the first season of Saturday Night Live. The comedy is not up to the high school level; one after another of the sketches falls completely flat. And there should be a contest about who was the worst host. Rob Reiner was pathetic. Lily Tomlin was excruciatingly bad. And as for Louise Lasser.....Then there was the bad music. And the garrish clothes. And the stiflingly uniform political correctness (even before the term was invented), made to seem oh-so-daring. (It takes a lot of courage and smarts to make fun of Gerald Ford.) In short, drugs help make these programs funnier than they were. Which is surely one of the problems haunting the performers and the writers who concocted some of the lamest excuses for comedy to be seen anywhere."
2,Bore me,"This 1st season is real boring. Mostly music, and the live music bands will send shivers up your spine. (not from delight). Most of it is repeated sketches from the last show and I did fast forward a lot. It was not funny, maybe one part was with the killer shark knocking at the door, but that's about it. It's lame, I wouldn't waste my bucks on it. I only give it a 1 star, I pushed the wrong star."
1,NOT - The Complete First Season,"This is false advertising. This DVD set is missing many pieces. Do not support this weak effort! Also, video quantity is very poor."
1,shocking,I WAS VERY EXCITED TO SEE WHAT I REMEMBER AS A GROUNDBREAKING SHOW----MAYBE THE FORMAT IN THE FIRST SEASON was groundbreakingBUT THE COMEDY WAS SO PALTRY I WAS SHOCKED & dumbstruck ! I GREW UP watching steve allen sid ceasar jackie gleason jack benny milton berle & jerry lewis when he was on shows- they were hysterical esp compared to these painfully amatuerish attempts at humor . this first season merely showed how un seasoned- these players were--- they got better as the troupe found what it did well and they began to hit their stride--- but i would avoid this altogether--its literally painful to watch ! there is really no indication here how funny this first group would become-- one thing and one thing only stood out for me --janis ian is a revelation---her performance was most touching and beautiful--i must say !!!!
4,The man form atlantis strikes back,"It's a classic televisión series, i have just one problem, the episodes don't have the secuence like on air. The video and audio are excellent"
1,Fresh Guarana?,"Dear Sirs,Firstable i was very happy to find guarana powder on the internet.Secontly the guarana where i purchase from you was not fresh.As ex importer of guarana powder in Greece i know very well any type of guarana.This guarana where you send is very old, maybe before 2 or 3 years ago.Wend you open any recipient of guarana you smell the caracteristical aroma of pure guarana.In my case this never happent and the taste is from something old.This is the worst guarana i ever purchase from somewhere.Please do something,Best RegardsIerotheos Saliamis"
3,so so,"Level is not high and i was expecting much more interesting right hand ideas. It's like basic patterns with pretty easy chords .. The setting itself is ok, nice filming but nothing special.. Capo btw used a lot, and i cannot say that overall i could take many ideas from this dvd. If you expect challenging guitar music like Dgary's, not sure this is the place :-)"
4,Well Researched and Absorbing,"I don't know why one of the other reviewers claims that Michael Newton shows sympathy for the young murderer, Edward Hickman. Although Newton clearly believes that the prosecution's psychiatrists were biased against Hickman, he in no way suggests that Hickman was anything other than a twisted, arrogant, and reckless psychopath. The background involving Hickman's family lasts only one chapter and is obviously relevant to the case.Newton did his homework, drawing on trial transcripts to give us a thorough review of this shocking homicide. The only thing that surprised me was that he does not seem to have read In Defense of the Fox, a memoir by Hickman's attorney, which would have shed additional light on the topic. Still, I think anyone who enjoys reading about crime, punishment, and old-time Hollywood will be rewarded by this book."
5,Karezza -the best love,"This comprehensive and poetic book on the most amazing way of loving should be in every home where love, sex and the union of two souls is the desire beyond all desires. I am convinced that through engagement of Karezza between two loving people - love will never die and as they say we would all be healthier both in spirit and body. A gorgeous easy read. An encouraging and nurturing book for both sexes and all couples to relish."
1,very disappointing,"This is not an objective, educational documentary, but one that judges and provides a lot of misleading and simply wrong information. A fictional voice-over by Jiang Qing, Mao's voice, puts words into her mouth that are so ridiculously silly that I wonder if the makers really knew what they were doing. This movie does very little (if anything) to place Yangbanxi into the complex context of socialist realism and art in Socialist totalitarian regimes. Not to be recommended to use in classrooms! Better to show a real Yangbamxi and let it speak for itself."
4,NLP Coaching,"This book is pretty basic coaching with the added dimension of NLP. It's good, but I think the authors could have strengthened the content."
1,Frizzy and cheap,"I was expecting a cheap wig when you pay 8 dollars for a wig you don't expect anything high class however I have found some decent wigs that are cheap. This is not one of them the wig was frizzed out and had static to the point I couldn't touch it unless I wanted half the wig to come off with my gloves, just plain nylon gloves mind you. never getting this again"
1,Better Quality please?,"The wig came on time which made me very happy. But once I took it out and brushed through it once, hair was already falling out. It is a bit frustrating to style a wig when hair is falling in your face. Can't say i am pleased with this product. The quality is poor. A purchase that I should not have been made."
5,Simplemente Excelente!,"Realmente creo que fue todo un acierto descubrir el trabajo de Adriana Evans ya que la calidad musical de su album, asi como la calidad vocal hacen de éste album ser indispensable en la coleccion de un fanatico como yo del soul jazz R&B.. Espero que tengan la oportunidad de escucharlo. No se arrepentiran"
5,"Adriana, where are you? Your fans eagerly await part II","This is one of the best albums from the late 90's and where is her follow up? This wonderful singer combines the essence of such singers as Sade, Roberta Flack and Angela Bofil. An exceptional piece of soul. What was Loud Records thinking when they let her go? More proof that a hip hop label cannot sustain Soul and R&B acts to save their lives. Labelmate Davina suffered at Loud, and her Album is worth checkin' out as well. If you are a true music lover, Adriana Evans will send you flying to new heights. I just want more...."
4,Nice to hear someone with an actual voice,Adrianna Evans is an overlooked talent. She has a great voice and actually can hit notes without the help of electronics. She can outsing any of the female artist on the scene today and really ushered in the neo-soul generation. This album actually was released in 1997 but still sounds fresh today which is a testament to her timeless music. I hope one of the record company gets wise and gets her back in the studio.
5,Soundtrack for Noah's Arc,Adriana's CD was featured on Noah's Arc (LOGO network) soundtrack. She is a BEAST and I can not wait for the arrival of my copy!
3,Lenora's picks,"The CD was not one of my favorite. Perhaps, it is best suited for a younger audience rather than a middle aged woman."
4,A NEGLECTED TALENT,"Adriana Evans where are you ?,in an age when note breaking, screeching and warbling is considered the norm and recognised as good singing it, is a pleasure to play this album time and time again.It is an intelligent and thoughtfully put together album. As a vocalist there is an influence of Jean Carn,but it is an recognisable voice and one should have at least have more than this single piece of work available."
5,Thoroughly Enjoyable,"Love this CD and listened to it all the time when I first bought it. I'd like to characterize the music as somewhere between old-school R&B with hiphop elements. To me, the music creates a sexy & romantic mood. Not a coincidence that the W Hotel put ""Love is All Around"" on one edition of their in-house CDs a few years ago, which was how I learned about Adriana Evans. Do agree with other reviewers that she has been unjustly overlooked. Anyway, at some point I had thought that this CD marked the end of her career, but she just released a new CD in August 2004, which you can obtain straight from her web site, http://www.adrianaevans.com/ I just ordered my copy and am eagerly anticipating it!"
5,Excelent mystry horror thriller,"This series, in its first few episodes, at first seems to be a B level splatter fest set in a high school, with the usual dollop of teen romantic angst.But then the surface of events begins to go transparent, revealing both depths and darkness that go far beyond what at first seems to be a run of the mill teen horror/drama.""No one here is quite what they seem.""This series is an excelent mystry, horror thriller; it's deep structure flawlessly weaves comming of age theems with reflections on the motives of both pure evil and the striveing for redemption.For anime fans, this is a 'must see'!"
1,"Great idea, poor quality","Sorry to say I did buy this bulb about 8 months ago, and it died within 7 months.Expensive bulb with ions that I really could not tell if it was actually working.Again, great idea but quality is poor and is overpriced."
3,"Wanna buy, seeking validation","It's an interesting concept but I failed to find any review on it and I really looked.There's a one article talking about a patent filed for it, on the manufacturer's website. Another article mentioned it as a ""green"" idea to combine producing light and negatively ionized air at the same time--more on the concept than the effectiveness.Just curious whether there's any third party validation, lab reports, etc. at all?"
3,Lots of Information,"This book had a ton of information in it, however we used it as a textbook and it had no index to find information and you would simply have to read and read and read to find the specific information you needed--unless you have a photogenic memory!"
2,Not real best of.,Don't buy this Cd. Complete RCA - Victor Mid - forties recordings (1944 -1946) is better way.Where are songs like Midriff or Work Song?In my opinion this is not real best of. There are better songs on Complete Mid - forties 3cd box.
4,Best of of the Complete RCA Victor Mid-Forties Recordings,"Apparently there are several CD's with the same name, but different recordings. This is not the one that I had wanted, but is OK. Unfortunately, I had not noted the songs that I had found so fantastic, so cannot order the one I really want."
2,I couldn't finish it.,"I had trouble reading this book. I didn't finish it. It seems plodding and takes forever to get to the point. Lots of long long run-on sentences. There were entire paragraphs that were one sentence long! My attention span is not that long. I admit I'm no intellectual, maybe that's the problem. I read his Brooklyn Bridge book and enjoyed that very much."
3,"OK, but Sort of a Strange Approach","I was not as enammored with Mr. Talese's work as the previous three reviewers. It was ,of course, extremely well written, but the book contained about as much about other people's lives as Talese's. He says early on that he has several folders of info for books that for one reason or another never got into print. Then, he proceeds to kind of give us abbreviated versions of these ""books"". He devotes a lot of coverage to a restrantuer friend of his, an address where several reastaurants came and left, a lot of Italy things, personalites in Selma, AL, and even an extensive treatment of the Lorena Bobbit affair. But, the strangest off the map topic was his obsession with a story about a Chinese soccer player who missed a shot on goal to lose an international championship. There just was no story of interest there. It all just didn't compute. I would have preferred his telling me more about his life."
4,Talese still has what it takes.,"I listened to Arthur Morey (very engagingly) read this book on CD while I commuted by car or bicycle, ran or just walked the dog. It's that kind of book and no more. Your mind can wander and pick up the thread in no time. Talese is an interesting, shrewd, charming, moderately wise and becomingly modest man in his early seventies. I doubt that Nan Talese--his tough-minded editorial wife--approved the needless repetitions and the loose organization. Yet the reader comes to appreciate how Talese was able to approach and ultimately master the more disciplined works of his earlier years about the New York Times, where he once was a reporter, or the Mafia. Anyone considering free-lance journalism as a profession should read this book. Talese is no genius, but he has proven over time that he has what it takes."
4,One of the best books I've read,"One of the best writers of the last years writing his life for us, readers, to learn abput him and how every single moment in life can be crossed by history. It's a jewel for journalists and anyone interested in learning about the process of writing."
1,Buy elsewhere for much less,Google around; I got mine for <1/3 of this price at eTrailer - looked here first because I have A-Prime.
3,Sweet Louisiana Sound...Smooth,"""Sweet Louisiana Sound"" is just one of those songs that draws you in from the first chord. Even the tongue in cheek lyrics are fun ""I've been waiting for the storm to pass, I clear a path and you could kiss my a$$ goodbye."""
1,rip off!,"One can find this same product for free on internet. The info in the short ""booklet"" is useful. I have cited this source in a few papers for graduate school. I do not think something that can be found for free should be sold on Amazon!!"
3,Good clinical background but nothing exciting,"It's basically an expanded waiting room pamphlet, which is ok because that's more or less what I was expecting. It provides the industry definition of this condition, nothing more."
1,words cannot due justice...,"I have seen my share of worthless ""entertainment"" in my day,this release gives new meaning to ""trash"" - but not ""trash"" as in totally void of morality (but fun anyway),but as in ""trash""that's not worth the disc it's mastered to! These ""films"" demonstrate mind-numbingly amateurish ""acting"" that I haven't experienced in quite some time.Jeez,we really must not have anything left to release on the dvd format,as this set proves they are scraping the bottom of the barrel!I really am struggling to recognize any talent Subversive Cinema is seeing in this?Trust me,the ""shocking violence"" is nothing you haven't seen already (and much more convincingly) in many other exploitation films from decades past.I want my money back...."
5,great band!!!!!,"I can't express fully in words how much i enjoy this cd. Every once in a while you will hear a cd that the first song on the cd grabs you and makes you want to listen to it over and over. That song is ""220 years"" and i still listen to it at least twice every time i listen to this cd.I have only seen Hot Water Music live one time, but it was wonderful!! They were so tight and good live. And MAN!! their bass player is great!!!!!!!!!if you like Hot Water Music.....Check out Small Brown Bike, I promise you won't be disapointed!!!!!!"
3,You could do better than this item,"With this Item there are some pluses and some minuses. On the plus side it has a powerfull enough motor to slice chesses, which some slicers dont recommend and cleanup is a whiz. On the minus side, the material the slicer is made of drags a bit on the item sliced, sometimes making slices uneven. The grim reality of life is that meats and cheeses slide easier over plastic than they do over aluminum or steel. This problem likely exists with most slicers made of steel and aluminum, so dont discount this item becaues of this review. The easy cleanup is a good tradeoff for the functionality issues. Overall, for a slicer that I use every other week im satisfied with the purchase, but just a bit disappointed with the the function. My old plastic krupps slicer sliced thinner, although much more difficult to clean."
1,Broke the First Time I Used It,The first time I used this slicer it broke - the plastic gear wheel teeth broke off. I did get a few slices of bread cut before this happened. The bottom of each slice got caught in the space below the blade. I returned it for a refund the same day.
1,junk,what a pice of junk used it two times and it broke as I was cutting meat to make jerky hade to return it
1,Piece of garbage,This product is very plastic and could not slice regular piece of cheese. The motor is not strong enough it broke down. Had some hard time to return the product to the manufacturer and still got no replacement .
3,I don't know,Unit works well to a certain extend? Either the motor or the blade are not up to the job of slicing? I have to actually pull the carriage back and slam it into the blade for it to slice anything. My cheaper grade slicer was much better at slicing.
3,Rock banana chips!,The only thing I didn't like about this mix is that the banana chips were as hard as rocks! I picked those out and enjoyed the rest of the mix.
3,Buy a can of peanuts instead.,"It's very disappointing that this product is at least 95% peanuts, with ""fruit"" being almost non-existent. I would have given it fewer than 3 stars, but I couln't honestly say I hated it. I don't hate peanuts. I just expect fewer of them in a product called ""trail mix"" and ""fruit and nut."" I won't buy this again."
2,Could've Been Better,"Was expecting to hear some great Broadway selections by one of the greatest vocalists ever. I was pretty disappointed. All but one of these songs are slow and schmaltzy - the lone exception is ""On the Street Where You Live"" which, while catchy, didn't exactly live up to what it could've been. The best songs are the ones not actually on the album - go to YouTube and search for ""Tell Me On a Sunday"" and ""Pinball Wizard"". Much better selections. Still, ""Someone to Watch Over Me"", ""Summertime"" and ""It's in Every One of Us"" are decent cuts also. Just thought it would be a lot better."
1,Had Dennis DeYoung taken a cue from Lionel Richie ...,"he'd not be in the position he is in now. Instead of concentrating on his primary strength -- writing ballads (and none worth mentioning except, perhaps, Styx's ""Lady""), he flounders in rock numbers and showtunes. Puzzling. Arrogant. Wasteful. Throwing a record to the wall to see if it sticks is a one hell of a painful way to burn the last drop of fuel to an already exhausted career. But DeYoung is tenacious -- as you can expect more recordings from him in the future. Wasting valuable resources is apparently never an issue for DeYoung. It seems giving this record 1 star is generous enough. If you're waiting for another ""Lady"", better check out the Lionel Richie catalog."
4,Give my regards to Dennis!,"I've always been a huge fan of Styx, especially Dennis De Young. I bought this album mainly because I wanted to hear more of Dennis De Young's powerful voice. I love the remakes of many Broadway hits--especially the a capella version of ""On The Street Where You Live."" I also love his remake of ""Memory"" from Cats, which I find very touching. The only thing that I'm disappointed in with this album is that it doesn't have much of an orchestra or a big band--which I would've liked even better. This is an exceptionally good album, though."
4,I adore Dennis DeYoung but...,"I have such mixed emotions about this cd. As ever, DeYoung's voice is indescribable but some of his artistic choices leave you wondering ""What was he thinking?""The first track, ""Someone to Watch Over Me"" disappointed me with some awkward lyric changes not to mention a soaring intro with a full orchestra that is not heard from again for the rest of the selection.Another odd choice was a Doo Wop version of ""The Street Where You Live"". Hmmm.Most of the rest of the cd was as wonderful as expected. Maybe I'll just fast forward through a couple of tracks."
5,Outstanding,"I heard the cut ""On the Street Where You Live"" on the radio and being a fan of a capella music, I bought the album for that track alone. I was amazed at the other 9!! I am not even a fan of Memories, however I never skip to the next track while it is playing. Someone to Watch Over Me, is probably the best arrangement of that song I have ever heard. Get it while you still can."
5,What a voice!,"Several years ago I saw traveling show of Jesus Christ Superstar starring the two leads from the movie version. This was an exciting prospect, but when the show was over they were forgotten because Dennis DeYoung played Pilate, and he blew them off the stage! I snapped up this album shortly after and I was richly rewarded--not only Pilate's Dream from the show, but some of the best Classic American Popular songs are included on the CD. This one should be at the top of anyone's list."
1,Stick with the subject and finish a story,"The book, which promises an insight into the workings of a forensic entomologist, falls very short of my expectations. The cases that are reviewed do not go in to much detail about how the insect evidence was actually analyzed but seems to diverge into how everyone else contributed to the cases. It was a lot of moralizing and not much content. After reading Dead Reckoning, which does deliver some content this book is a true disappointment"
1,Careless editing,"This book contains errors in simple editing that caused frustration when reading the assigned chapters. The authors seem more concerned with gaining citation credit than with providing a clear and concise textbook for a Graduate level university class. I would not recommend this book as a text nor would I recommend it for anything other than providing a cursory overview of theories of second language acquisition. Explanations are unclear, the authors verbose, and it provided nothing more than an essay in texbook production for profit."
4,Beatle Banner,"This is a well written and fascinating novel of a step by step, blow by blow account of the Beatles' daily lives as well as a good general overview of the band's inception and break up. I liked the way the author gave great detail to the myth about Paul's ""death"" and his equally mythical ""twin"" who filled in for him.Although there are a few grammatical issues, this book is sure to delight most Beatles fans with its sharp, trenchant writing style. The individualized treatment each Beatle receives makes this novel well worth the read."
5,Let the dancing begin!,this disco ball was excellent quality and a Great size! was packaged nicely and arrived in great time!thanks - it is aweome
3,Diggin' Diggin' For the Underground Science,"Although I can't trash this record because I feel it does represent a fraction of the underground and true hip-hop movement. I need to say that the production is lacking the intensity of these Emcees, it's just too underwater. I think that Mass Influ has done much better work epecially with Dynamic Syncopation out of Ninja Tune and on various other compilations (Check out Dynamic Sync)."
3,(3+HALF) MASS got it locked down to SCIENCE!,"Tight buttery flows, jazzy samples and tight basslines+beats make this an excellent album all round. The 2 mc's show nothing but skills on this over some beautiful beats than compliment each other perfectly. Although there's only 10 tracks+intro and its just under the 47mins mark it does enough to suggest that they are a tight clique+know what they're doing. The standouts are ""this is the way"", ""under pressure"" (my favourite), ""space cases"", ""rhyme placement"" and ""life to the mc"" with its brilliant beat-box beat. Ya gotta hear it to appreciate it. Excellent album, go cop it!!"
2,A little To sappy,Well I hate to be the person who makes everyone else mad but I got to say these books are a little to sappy for me. They wuld be great it they only touched on Amy's mom a little instead the seem to focous on her. Plus this book is sad! I don't really like reading sad books. Isn't life sad enough? Why write a book that makes it sadder? Well the first 2 were pretty good but this one kinda turned me off of the serious.
5,"Touching, and True to Life","Business has been slow at Heartland. But Amy forgets that when Pegusus, the last thing of her old life, get's sick.Lou has some good ideas to help raise the business, but is Amy ready for more of Lou's new ideas?When she picks up Promise, a saddle-shy Arabian mare from a prestigious Arabian breeder, Amy begins to doubt her own abilities.Between School, Promise, and Pegusus, Amy learns how to restore Heartland, and heal her own heart.Breaking Free touched me, and stayed true to life in everything it wrote of. If we just LISTEN. . . we can hear a lot."
4,Very touching,"This book is very touching, and if ever you feel that you are the saddest person in the world, read this and see that people can be sadder than you. I don't know how that helps, but sometimes it does. Enough people have written like the summary of this story, so I won't write it."
3,NOT ENOUGH HORSE!,"Okay, well I like this book a lot and the situations are great. The joining up is super, and I like the charcters. But I give it the bad rating because I got this book to read about the horse part. I mean, I expected the book to be CENTERED around a horse or two. I would like to learn more about the treatments for Pegasus. I would like to know about Promise, and how they cared for her, not just how they tried to cure her. And for a while, they did not even MENTION the other horses around the farm. And in real life, that is NOT the way that it goes. You can not forget all the horses in the stable for two. I would like to know more about the WORK arounf the stables, they are only showing you the glamorous side, I guess that you could say."
5,Breaking Free is really good!,"This book was the first of the Heartland series that I read, and I still think that it is the best!! It does have some sad parts, what with Amy losing her mother and now someone/thing else (I won't say too much), but it lets you tag along while Amy tries to move on. It's beautiful written and I think that Lauren Brooke is a really good author, and her plots are original and exciting. Lots of different qualities of different books are mixed into one in the Heartland series, and I definetely recommend this book and others in the series."
3,Hail Britiannia,"A very readable account of (one of) the moment(s) England was challenged by a continental power and Europe hung in the balance.Like Churchill more than three centuries later, Elizabeth I was helped quite mightely by the English Channel, but in her case the seemingly miraculous destruction of the Spanish fleet resulted in her near-deification. And rightfully so."
2,Higher Sources,"It is to be hoped that the sources would be much higher than these, and that they would seek higher!"
4,Black Beauty: A History and a Celebration,"Nice book...delivered on time...only disappointed because I thought I had ordered a hard cover vs the soft cover received. The purpose of the book is aesthetics...coffee book...thus, hard copy wanted.Nevertheless, I am very appreciative for professional promptness."
3,Get the whole bean version,"Ever since my first stop at Intelligentsia in Chicago, I've really liked Intelligentsia black cat espresso.It's ideal for my taste: sweet, rich, chocolatey, well-balanced acidity, great mouthfeel, wonderful thick dark crema. Mmmmmmmmmmmmm....I don't have a good grinder at home, though, so I thought I'd try the pre-ground version.It made fine shots, but not anywhere near as good as ground-right-before-brewing black cat. In fact, I think that the shots from the pre-ground black cat are not too different from some of the Lavazza pre-ground coffees (which are a fair bit cheaper).So, if you have a good grinder, black cat is brilliant (but get the whole bean one, not pre-ground). If you don't have a good grinder, and you are buying pre-ground espresso, you might as well save a few bucks and get cheaper pre-ground coffee (and put the savings into your piggy bank for that future grinder purchase!)."
3,Maybe I don't know Espresso,"I was very disappointed in this bean, but admit i might not be the target audience. I am used to dark black, rich beans like Peet and (sorry folks) Starbucks espresso. I found these beans light brown and unimpressive, a medium roast at best. Even using the aeropress, my results were sad, bordering on awful. Again, I won't contest the reviews of espresso experts - but if like me you are used to a dark bean for espresso, proceed with caution."
5,Black Cat espresso,"Amazing quality product, the best I and my guests have ever tasted. coffee/espresso sales have actually quadrupiled."
3,"Other ways to say ""said"".","This author has a faily decent story to tell. It is very difficult to listen to this book because of his use of the word said. There are so many other ways to express the same thought--reply,commented, stated are just a few. He needs a course in the mechanics of writing!"
1,Jesse Stone in Paradise,"This is the last book I will ever purchase by Mr. Parker, after a lifetime of buying his hardcovers. The reason? His ridiculous and unreal mooning over a really unlikeable, unbelievable ex-wife which serves only to detract from the real character of Jesse Stone.We like to think of Jesse Stone as a solver of problems: he is doing just that now in Paradise, MA...it is unreal to believe that, five books later he has come no further than the juvenile pining portrayed by Mr. Parker in this book. It seems to be getting worse, rather than better which only serves to make us feel Jesse is going backwards....and we do not want to believe that for a moment.Hopefully, Mr. Parker will find a really good shrink and clear his head of this unproductive mess. Then, we can concentrate and the terrific plot and story lines he brings us and not be sidetracked by the dumbdown of an unbelievable side story. Too many pages on too little reality."
2,Jesse need to move on,I usually love Parker's books but I' m tired of Jesse mooning over Jenn. He needs to get a life. What a waste. I just can't accept that he is such a doormat for this woman. It denigrates him as a man; where is his self respec? Sunny could be one answer but maybe she just ought to go get Richie back. She is a better character than jesse and I'd ilke to see more of her books.
2,Not as good,"I have read a lot Robert B Parker novels and enjoy both the Jesse Stone and Spenser novels. I especially like reading them because they are an easy read and the characters on the whole are quite likeable. However, High Profile gives too much space to the ex (Jenn) who does not appear to have much in the way of personality. It is preferable (for me) where her presence is limited to telephone calls and leaves the way open to more interesting, likeable people. All in all it seemed a bit flat."
4,THREE AND A HALF STARS FOR STONE,"Ok, avid Parker fan, love Spenser, Stone, Suuny and all the support characters. Will finish all the books in the three series, but enough is enough. Stone's issue are getting old. God, I hope it moves on. This book was the least favorite so far, saved by Suit and Molly. A double murder mystery but not a good who-done-it. Read the series and enjoy. RECOMMENDED"
2,Ack,"Thirty-five years ago Mr. Parker started a series about a guy who thought and and acted differently, and the books were fresh and clever. The thing about the books was the way the charaters thought about things, and that was expressed through dialog. By now, we all know very well how RBP's chraacters think, so there's really nothing new to say, unless we start having the characters say things that no person on earth would say. If you can sit through this without wishing that most of the protagonists would be stabbed or beaten, God bless you."
1,Juvenile & Boring,"This is my first and last Robert Parker novel. I found the writing very juvenile, the storyline dull and unfocused and the character development very thin. There are much better authors to spend your time and money on. Avoid this stinker of a book!"
2,Plodding in Paradise,"Parker's minimalist approach to writing has lost its charm and become merely tedious. The plot and characters lack depth and substance, making this book a chore to read. There are 2 more coming down the pipeline in the next few months which seems to indicate that the motive for writing is far more about dollars than story development or reader satisfaction."
1,Not at all up to standards.,"I love reading Robert Parker. Short chapters. Spenser, Jesse Stone, Paradise etc. etc. But if I had not known that Parker was the author of this mess, I never would have guessed. It lacks a good plot. Very flimsy characters, except the wise cracking, Scotch drinking Stone,and just left me glad that I can now go to another book. Please, Mr. Parker, give us a bit more the next time."
1,Loser of a book,"What a disappointment. I have long enjoyed the Spenser books, as well as the spin-offs, although I don't fully understand why the characters all have to interact.This book is a stinker. (Blue Screen too, though a little less so.) It is not possible to sympathize with alcoholic Jesse Stone as he remains obsessed with his abusive wife Jenn. Jenn is horribly narcissistic and manipulative--I venture to say that the character is not realistic in the least--at least I hope not. So we lose interest in Jesse as he worries about his wife who sleeps with whoever comes along, and apparently we are supposed to care about these characters. I don't think so.Meanwhile, Sunny is hung up on her ex (not to mention her dog), and we have long put up with Spenser and his ups and downs with his inamorata Susan.Perhaps Robert Parker should deal with his relationship issues outside his writing and return to amusing plots without the masochism.--A disappointed reader"
4,a good read,"This is another Jesse Stone book and as always they are good books to read. Hard to put down because you want to find out what is happening and how Jesse is able to solve the problems that arise.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
3,"A quick, fun read","Short chapters and simple charactors made this a quick read. Written mostly as dialogue, the charactors are simple, witty and enjoyable. Althougth the crime appears complicated, it's soultion rings true to the way most police work is done."
4,Great read and continuation of Stone and Randall stories,"As a long time fan of RBP, I really enjoyed this story. I agree with some of the other reviewers here that the ""mystery"" here is a bit light, but what really makes this book is the continuation of the relationship between Jesse and Sunny. It was also great to see more of the relationships between Jesse and Molly and Suit at the Paradise police station. One of the things I like best about this story is how it continues to show Jesse's evolution in Paradise - since he arrived from L.A. as a drunk ex-homicide cop he has made great strides, but I love the fact that RBP is taking his time with Jesse. There are no easy answers, no ""made-for-TV"" conclusions."
3,Not Worth the Money,"My problem is that it's a 270 page book with big type, extra white space between lines and 3 page chapters that end with half a page of white space left. My reading time is too important to me to read something that is clearly intended to be a script for another movie. Parker seems to be one of a number of authors who churn out quick novels (with the help of other writers?) and keep the money coming in.Read Greg Iles, William Lashner and other writers who do their homework and write books worthy of your money and time."
1,From Kansas,"This is the most disappointing piece of childish trash I have encountered in many a day. I have absolutely wasted my money and feel cheated. This piece of junk is without literary value of any kind. If you enjoy reading about a cop who is going to a shrink to get free, of among many things, a drinking problem, but who continually walks around evenings with a stiff drink in his hand moaning about how much he loves his ex wife who is having affairs with others, then this is your piece of writing. Notice i didn't say literature. An extremely poorly written piece of garbage!!!"
3,"3.5 stars - Love Parker's dialogue, bored with the relationships","First Sentence: Each spring surprised Jesse.A high-profile talk-show host is found hanged in the park. His assistant/girlfriend is found dead in a dumpster. As if Police Chief Jesse Stone doesn't have enough with two murders, his ex-wife, Jenn, calls to say she was raped and is being stalked. While Jesse investigates the murders, Sunny Randall, with whom he has been building a relationship, agrees to stay with Jenn and find the stalker.I love Parker's writing but his stories are starting to bore me, which is a shame. I will always say he is the master of dialogue, even the laconic Jesse, whom Parker offsets with Suit, the young policeman and the best character in the story. The murders and their investigation is interesting. But I could do completely without the can't-live-with, can't-live-without relationships. It wasn't a great book, but there was still enough of Parker's classic style that I enjoyed it."
2,"Lazy, Lazy, Lazy","I read all the glowing reviews and couldn't help but wonder if I read the same book. I read this book in one sitting this evening and it was mediocre at best. I wasn't too keen w/ the last RBP book that I read either.He seems to be veering down that James Patterson road- thin plot and not much other substance.And, yet again, his so-called knowledge of women and women's issues had me shaking my head. Is Susan the only positive woman that he can have in his books. Well, Sunny Randall is a stronger character, as well.I was really disappointed with this book and very glad that my father in law shared it--it was checked out from the library.I miss the old RBP--with the better, witty writing. The last few books are really beach reads or at the very least get the book at the local library and save your money."
3,over use of the word,"I am listening to this book on cd and I am getting irritable. I like the story in itself but the author needs to use words other than SAID! Jesse said, Molly said, So and so said, said said said. How about words like responded, asked, descriptive words based on their conversations instead of everyone said. I it quite annoying"
5,Jesse Stone - TomSelleck,First bought because of previous Jesse Stone stories. He is an interesting and complicated character. I enjoy mysteries therefore to me it is a fantastic read. Had a hard time putting it down. Fortunately only had to twice. Love being surprised by who actually committed the deed. While reading I picture Jesse as Tom.I have seen all the books that were made into shows. Loved every one. They could not have chosen a more perfect fit actor for the part. I recommend for a fun murder mystery read. Seeing the previous book shows helps make it fun.
2,Robert Parker High profile,Printed very poorly with missing pages and smeared print. The story is fine but the book is a last class printing job..
3,High Profile (Jesse Stone),Never takes off. It would take Tom Selleck playing him in the movie to make it work. Hope he does the whole series.
2,Could have been better,"When I was in school, I was taught to write words that expressed the emotion. I did not make it past the first 3-4 chapters in this book. Even when a character was asking a question, the author insisted on writing, the words, ""he said"" or ""she said"". Honestly, when a character is asking a question, it would make more sense for the author to write, ""he asked"", ""she queried"", or something similar. He said, she said is simple, elementary school writing. If it hadn't been for this, the book may have kept my attention."
2,Disappointed,"I have to agree with several other reviewers. This is the last of Jesse Stone books I'll read. I am sick of his obsession with his ex-wife and failure to move on from his drinking issues and the inability to select a better woman from the plethora of beautiful, intelligent, loving women he comes across. Also, it really detracts from listening to the audio book when every time someone speaks it's: he said, she said, Jesse said, Suit said... even when someone is asking a question. Where's the editing???? This series could be so much better if he would just dump Jenn once and for all and start using proper grammar (or whatever it's called)."
1,Save your money buy it used for one dollar,Poor Jesse...boo what a dull character and boring story. Buy this at a used books sale for no more than a dollar.
1,terrible writing,could not get past page 3 due to the terrible writing. is it really needed in a 2 person conversation to have he said/she said after every sentence--- NO ! after seeing all the t v jesse stone movies i was really looking forward to reading the books.
1,Don't waste your time.,"This tale fails completely because the central premise, and therefore conclusion, is utterly transparent and predictable. The characters are of the variety you can find in any typical soap novel by Danielle Steele and Jackie Collins. I would elaborate, but I don't think it deserves a longer review. Just skip this one."
3,Puzzling,"I came upon this album digging through my mother's LP's and found it a nice listen. It's abstract and instrumentally varied, challenging with each play. For a dipsily pleasant experience, you'll not go wrong with this."
3,Free Form Sound,"Robert is cleansing his musical palate with this release. It does not sound like anything else he ever released. I listen to it like a Brian Eno ambiance album. Metal Machine Music anyone? Free form jazz and rock rhythms. I hoped for drum wizardry and whimsical vocals and lyrics. That isn't what I got. Like I said, ambient music from my musical hero."
4,dogonnit,"this is a nice movie, has funny moments w/the farleys and the stuart.luke is funniest when he told his sister that he was eaten by aliens ""hours ago"" and he does a nice job on vocals for ""get up"" i also like it when he takes care of dexter......."
4,Dog Gone Good,Purchased for 9 year old grand son. He likes it and I found it to be a nice family oriented movie. I was pleasantly entertained.
5,Funny movie. Great for kids.,My 2 year old loves it. Watches it over and over again. The 7 year old and the 10 year old loves it too. I like watching it myself. Always brings a laugh.
1,You might enjoy laughing at how bad it is,"Was looking for a family friendly movie. We certainly enjoyed this... by making fun of the bad acting, stale goofy jokes (the bad guys actually light a match after passing gas in a car), and bizarre computer animated animals thrown in randomly. Yikes."
2,Do not bother to buy,Style=LAtype=more performance than socialThere are so many bad points for this dvd I do not know where to start.At 35 minutes it is way too short for a good value dvd today.The teachers bad technique & knowledge of Salsa & Cuban dancing is an embarrassment.I would not let these teachers out of a beginners class.Do not bother to buy. There are other far better instructional Salsa dvd's being sold on Amazon.
1,Release postponed for Canada and US??,This order has been sitting in pending status for sometime. I have learned the US release of PopArt on any media will not occur until early next year; I wonder if this applies to the Canadian DVD since it's region 1 encoded: US and Canada???
4,Hilarious,"Some of these videos are just hilarious. Dated. Cliched. Very Eighties. What I really enjoyed is the running commentary with Chris and Neil ( even they seem embaressed by some of their own videos.) Insightful and sometimes very funny. If PSB is your kinda thing ( you know who you are, you wouldn't have gotten this far if you don't like them ) pick up this DVD. It's FABULOUS."
4,about the music video MTV...Pop Art......,"This is one of the good collections from Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe (Pet Shop Boys)even though the price is a little steep. Recommended to those whom are interested in this genre of Music Video DVD..MTV.....Written by:Dr, Prof (PhD)Ang Poon KahTC Submission for 'this'/money government.Syncast for Mystery of the NileImagine entertainment for Da Vinci Code.Zakkers film director."
3,Don't get this for the videos.,"I have been a longtime Pet Shop Boys fan since the days of West End Girls. I occassionally see a PSB video playing at the gay bars. So when I saw this I wanted to get it. I don't regret the purchase because I'll always love these songs. But from a visual standpoint some of the videos were very dissapointing. For example the video for ""Home and Dry"" consist mostly of mice in a subway station with an occasional shot of PSB on a stage. Huh? I will probably play this for background music as opposed to watching it for the videos on a regular basis."
4,haven't stopped playing it,"Before buying this dvd, I pretty much had only known the American top 40 tracks. I never knew just how much I hadn't heard or seen. The Commentary section is not to be missed, but make sure you have a martini or two beforehand so that you are on the same wavelength that it sounds as they were on. ""Go West"" is powerful and great visually. ""Always on my mind"" is just so entertaining. ""Domino dancing""....whew when you hear the commentary you'll appreciate the video even more. If you're thinking about buying it, just do it, you will not be disappointed."
2,give it up,"From the suburbs of Chicago comes a suburban Chicago band that is just that - boring, nothing cutting edge, innovative, new or even immitated particularly well.Atomic Dreamland is a all but a very late cool name with disapointing songs to accompany it with."
3,Good,Black Sabbath would be proud of this band. That being said this is the only album worth buying by them for Sign Of The Wolf (Pentagram)
5,Essential Reading on Freedom,"Parson's essay Freedom is a Two-Edged Sword is a brillant work on individual liberty and how it can be realised by all. Alot of what Parson's has to say is in the tradition of John Locke, but written in a style more appealing to today's reader. Written in the 1940's his insight into moral, religious, social and sexual issues is still very relevant today. I promise you will find memorable quotes on every page of the main essay so be ready with either a good highlighter or red pencil to underline them because you will be doing alot of that."
5,Very humorous book,This book makes you laugh while helping you pull your one-householder life together. It shows the 20% pits and 80% joys of living by oneself [while waiting for a great relationship to come along]. Extremely informative reading.
2,doesn't stand the test of time,"After owning this camera for one year, it has developed power issues. it randomly powers down (says low battery), we have tried replacing the batteries (even high end lithium batteries) but it dies after one or two pictures or while changing to flash mode.Changing between flash and no flash is very slow.Shutter has more lag than many digital cameras.menu joystick is difficult to use and small.Posed pictures turn out beautiful but if your trying to capture a moment its almost impossible.I no longer recommend this camera, its useless to have a camera if you cant turn it on long enough to get a picture."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"This camera doesn't take pictures well at all, except if what you are shooting isn't near any sunlight(white out), or moving at all (totally blurry). Please look elsewhere for a digital camera."
4,comfortable seat,"Very comfortable seat. I weigh 300 and although the seat is comfortable, the rods under the saddle bent under my weight and the seat had to be replaced. I recommend the seat for riders with less weight."
2,didn't last a year,I was going to submit a picture of this thing after only one year.. haven't done that yet. It's pretty much lost its whole top covering and looks like hell.
3,Not a complete version,"On the positive side, the Carrigan translation is based on the E. Allison Peer's which is currently out of print. The negative is that some of the chapters are omitted by the translator (he says since they are repetative or about John's religious community, that are insignificant). I would have to discagree. Without the full transalation, some pertanent insights can be lost.I have the downloaded the Peer's translation in both PDF and RTF format and am still looking (or hoping for a reprint) of a hardcopy from Ligouri"
4,Alfred Dunhill shares his Experience on Smoking,"This book was published in 1954, is 177 pages long, measures 8.25"" x 5.25"" x 7/8"" thick. Hard board covers and I believe was issued without a dust jacket. Published in NY by Putnam's sons. The book covers all the bases from the history of tobacco, to the history of the match, to tobacco for smoking by pipe, cigar and cigarettes, growing tobacco, cigarette manufacturing and pipe manufacturing. In fact much of the pipe manufacturing information in the book appears to be where Hacker got much of the info in his book The Ultimate Pipe Book. The little 1954 book is a great one and a quick read, will teach you thing you didn't know, and I would recommend it for those interested in pipe smoking."
1,I'd rather do nothing on a 5 hour plane ride than read this,"I only got through 122 pages, then gave up. I wasn't engaged, the characters were boring, and it wasn't fun reading a novel about writing a novel. I gave the book more of a chance than usual because I was stuck on a San Francisco-Newark flight with 2 hours to go, but ultimately decided staring out the window would be more interesting. I tossed it out as soon as I got off the plane."
1,Depressing...a waste of time,"Reading the book was like being forced to live in the minds of two definitive losers...one more boring and insecure than the last.In the end, it depressed me so much, I couldn't even get through the last 100 pages. That's right, I read about 250 pages of this self-indulgent nonsense without discovering so much as one character arc...flat, uninspired drivel.Don't be swayed by the premise...If I had read the reviews, I wouldn't have wasted my time."
1,"Excellent writer, but reading this book was like torture","This book was so depressing and the main characters were so frustrating (one is an egomaniac, the other becomes a self-destructive idiot). With both of the main characters headed for disaster, I could barely bring myself to read a chapter or two a week, and often wondered if I should even bother finishing the book. If I had read the reviews here, I would have known better."
1,Not Pleased,"I loved Drowning Ruth and was very excited to read this book; however, I was horribly disappointed. The main character is pretentious and boring. The first 300 pages were a struggle to get through, uneventful and dragged on. The only thing this book was good for was to make me feel good about the measly credit card debt I have racked up."
3,Entertaining for an ex-L.A. gal...,"This was a good read and a quick one, but what I enjoyed most were the Los Angeles (Westside) in-jokes. As an ex-Westwood person myself, I laughed out loud when Letty excitedly announces that she's scored a house north of Wilshire -- south of Sunset, but NORTH OF WILSHIRE! It's possible that you have to know LA to find this book as funny as I did. I did have a few good belly laughs while reading it.I'm certain that the museum depicted here is a lightly disguised Getty, and the satire is hilarious. The author has a good ear for speech, and a good sense of pacing. So what if you can see the plot ""coming down Broadway"", as the saying goes. It's still a well-written and entertaining novel."
1,SHEER BOREDOM!,"I was convinced that I couldn't go wrong with a second Christina Schwarz book since I enjoyed ""Drowning Ruth"" so much. How wrong I was! What could Schwarz have been thinking of to crank out this astonishingly boring tale made up of endless letters from Letty to her best friend? Two-thirds of the way through the book, I just lost all interest and began to skim; then stopped reading altogether. What a waste of time!I'm glad I read ""Drowning Ruth"" first; otherwise, I would never have read it, and that would have been a shame."
2,"Great expectations, terrific disappointment","When I saw Christina Schwarz's second novel displayed inside the door of a local bookstore, I snatched it up, assuming (you know what they say about ASSUMING) that I was in for another great read on the order of *Drowning Ruth.* No such luck. Protagonist Margaret Snyder's foibles fail to make her sympathetic, but succeed in irritating (and boring) the reader--at least this one. Nor was I able to accept the premise that Margaret's friend Letty--wife, mother of four, and purportedly a heretofore responsible and conscious adult--would suddenly lapse into complete financial idiocy. I'll continue to read Schwarz, because *Drowning Ruth* demonstrates a great storytelling talent. As for *All Is Vanity*--well, as an old friend used to say, ""Everyone's got to swallow a squid once in a while."""
1,Disappointing,"""Drowning Ruth"" was a tightly knit novel peopled withwell-drawn sympathetic characters in a tale with an inventive,intriguing plot.""All is Vanity"" contains only [weak] characters, and a plot so slight as to be virtually nonexistent.The author has a gift for description of place and the knowledge of what goals drive individuals to exceed their reach. She certainly illustrates both the New York and California locales with valid, poignant and amusing anecdotes.In this book, we can only ask ""who cares?""Ms. Schwarz portrays two women, both of whom lack substance, sincerity, credibility and character.Sorry, but this novel is not worth your time spent in reading it."
5,Redemption in the age of Consumerism,"Schwarz's novel ""All is Vanity"" places her on the chart of great classy writers. This novel is a modern interpretation of the notion of Redemption in an age where everything is open to interpretation. And a vision of what it means to really be 'creative' while surrounded by hypocricy and rampant consumerism. Having read ""Drowning Ruth,"" and, now, ""All is Vanity"" I can not wait to read the future works of Schwarz. Beautiful, involving, and engaging work defined by simple blocks that build slowly into a complex and meaningful reading of relationships."
1,Drowning in Vanity,"As Margaret, our narrator, ruins several lives in her efforts to get her novel published, it becomes quite clear that All is Vanity would never have earned publication without the success of Drowning Ruth. While Ruth is suspenseful, I had difficulty even getting through Vanity. The characters are annoying and nearly impossible to empathize with, and become more and more despicable with each passing page. Wholly unsatisfying."
2,boring,the actual story doesn't begin until about halfway through. the first half of this novel is a never-ending description of the main character's writer's block. three examples would have done fine; 300 is excruciatingly dull. there is nothing likable about the main character and the story she steals from her friend's emails isn't much more compelling. ho-hum.
3,nice,"not as huge as someone like Jay-Z or Eminem, but Mic Geronimo is nice. Any rap fan will like this."
5,Diz is hott...,"When hip-hop sounded like diz? And didn't sound gay like it doez today i would be more cds but lately only nas, jadakiss and feww others are doing they jobs. If your an old hip-hop head like me? Get if you already havent mic geronimo's "" vendetta"" is just right son."
5,Destiny - a super read!,"Destiny is a fun book. I found myself really looking forward to picking it up each night before bed. It's both reflective and adventurous, philosophical and practical. I particularly enjoyed the focus on surfing and the (sometimes poetical) proverbs distilled at the end of each chapter. Saying that, the book is relevant to business, relationships and many other life issues. I found the theme of ""authenticity"" quite inspiring too. Very glad I read it!!!(WARNING: It'll make you long for the waves)"
5,Amazing Match-up,Three musicians whom I've greatly admired in their respective fields come together from three different places in the music spectrum and sound like they've been playing together for years! I would love to hear this band live in any venue. Just a beautiful album .
4,Very nice collection...,"The only reason that this gets 4 stars instead of five is that the books aren't as solid as I remember them being. Still, if you are a fan of Grimjack (as I am), this collection is for you. I hadn't read any of these books in well over a decade (probably closer to 20 years), and they are not as great as I remember them, but they are still pretty darn good. Grimjack is a cool character in a cool universe with cool stories... there is a Frank MIller-esque appreciation for noirish action and dialogue that will entertain anyone who liked Sin City. Enjoy!"
2,Underperformed for a reason,"The principals do a fine job of performing their parts in this set which is underperformed perhaps because, aside from a few notably exceptional arias beautifully done by all of the artists in the casts, there is little of gripping musical merit in any of the three good stories. There are many good collections of performances available for much less expense, presenting these fine people singing really great arias without having to endure music and recititavo of little merit, questionably conducted, interspersed between the sparkling good stuff such as Gheorghiu's Babbino. Like all composers, not every note produced by Verdi is worth owning unless you are a true collector of Verdiana. I gave my copy away after two labored listenings."
1,Never Purchase used cd's,I purchased this item used---BIG MISTAKE. Some of the tracks had very little volume while others were very loud. The tonal quality was almost nonexistent.
5,Excellent CD,"A wonderful album! Highly recommended for its musicality, beautiful phrasing, and warm tone from all musicians. Although it veers toward a more romantic interpretation, it is very convincing."
4,a grand sweep of major inventions,"If you like the style of a Scientific American issue, then you should check out this book. Their editors have amassed a chronicle of key inventions and discoveries, spanning the history of human civilisation. Some 400 inventions are explained. Albeit briefly, because of space considerations.The book tries to put these into a context of ever onward and upward. Though in the historical periods (especially antiquity), these inventions must have been repeatedly invented and forgotten.As an item of terminology - the ""inventions"" also include things which are arguably discoveries. Like the positron. It certainly existed in nature before physicists were aware of it. Though algebra might indeed be an invention, to some who would regard it as a pure construct of the mind. But others, especially some physicists, would pay that no heed; saying that such things exist independent of human consciousness."
1,Don't buy this!!,"I tried this set for the first time today and I was so disappointed. Yes, it's cute and the cookies did come out well but I had to try 5 of the six shape inserts just to get the entire batch done because they kept breaking. This is not well made at all. It is poorly constructed of cheap steel and the pieces are not put together well. I am returning this item. Don't waste your time."
5,"Handy, space-saving cookie cutter.","If you like Linzer cookies, this is a good set to have. It may not be ""professional"" quality, I don't know, but I do like that it's six cutters in one, essentially. In addition, I love that it has a handy little plunger in case the dough sticks. For the price, this set is a great addition to my baking supplies."
4,Fox Run 6 piece Lintzer Cookie set,This is a nice set but the cookie size is smaller than my mother's traditional set from Austria. Very nicely manufactured.
1,Terrible quality and a waste of money,"Where to start? The packaging was terrible. The main cookie cutter was damaged and the edge pushed in and bent. Once I fixed that, the little attachments are flimsy and they fell off repeatedly. The cookie cutters are so cheaply made, I could bend them with no effort at all. A complete waste of time and money. Next time, I'll just pay a few extra bucks and buy the quality stuff from William Sonoma. I'd give it 'no stars' if that option were available."
2,You get what you pay for,"There is a reason why this is the least expensive linzer set - it's cheap, as in crap. I used 2 different center dies the first time, and after washing and drying (hand, then air) both are rusted already, as is the crimp cutter. I have had more of a problem with the dough sticking to the cutter than I am used to, and I'm guessing it's the cheap metal they use. I'll use them for the rest of the holiday season, but they they get chucked and I'm actually going to get a good set. I am a fairly expert home baker, so it is not operator error.Don't be disappointed that they're currently out of stock. It's doing you a favor."
4,Very nice,I've not yet used these but they appear to be of good quality and should last for a long time. The order came before the date it was due to arrive. Thanks Amazon.
5,Excellent product !!! Well under price,Not only do I use it in the kitchen but also I use it for my kids art and craft projects. It was everything I was hoping for and more. I would recommend it to all my friends.
5,Linzer Cookie cutters,"This product was exactly what I wanted, Made wonderful cut out cookies in the ""Linzer"" tradition, I am quite happy with it ."
1,not as pictured,"I was looking for a small star of david cookie cutter and the picture had that, but when I received the merchandise it was a 5 point star, so I returned it. Very disappointing."
5,AC/DC FTW!!!,AC/DC is the best band on earth. I have 7 of their CDs and am getting more. I recommend this CD because it has a little of everything from AC/DC. It even has a song from Bon Scott... My favorites from the CD are Shake Your Foundations and For Those About to Rock. AC/DC FOR LIFE!
3,Who Made Who,"On paper, Who Made Who is just a cheap soundtrack to a cheap movie (Stephen King's disastrous Maximum Overdrive), but it's actually much more than that. It serves as a ripping AC/DC retrospective, tearing through such classics as ""You Shook Me All Night Long"" and ""For Those About to Rock,"" adding the pounding title track to the band's canon, and rescuing overlooked songs like ""Sink the Pink"" from otherwise mediocre albums. It's not a perfect retrospective -- there's no ""Back in Black,"" ""Highway to Hell,"" or ""Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap"" -- but what is here is terrific."
3,just not necessary,"The low rating I'm giving this album has nothing to do with the quality of the music, which of course, is REALLY high because the album contains SOME of AC/DC's most well-loved songs that went on to become classics.The low rating is that, this is simply NOT enough music to satisfy hungry AC/DC fans desire to hear something new OR to sum up a solid collection of songs- it's just enough to provide a small taste of what the band was really about back in the day.This is simply just an album that includes a few of the bands most popular songs, and serves as a small greatest hits album in a way, with a title song that doesn't even get any radio play anymore, so it's basically a forgotten classic these days.This is just an album that doesn't have enough going for it, so you're better off just picking up the original albums these songs appeared on since those are the albums where those songs were better."
5,HOLY S*IT,"THIS ALBUM KICKS A*S, if you can't handle Angus Young in your face with amazing guitar solos then your p*ssy a*s needs too find music like Garth Brooks S*IT!!"
2,"Good, but wheres the bonfire?","It is an overall good album, but where is Bon Scott? In my opinion a greatest hits album would have:Hells BellsT.N.T.Back In BlackShoot to ThrillShook Me All Night LongHighway To HellGirls Got RythmAnd don't think that is all, but those would be a must on a greatest hits. I do not suggest getting this album, I say get all the albums instead, but it is NOT a bad album just doesn't have the best on it!"
1,collection.....,Funny thing is a greatest hits package would be their only fully good album. The rest have zero-two decent songs and that's it. Waste of money for one decent song here.
2,Who Made You?,"Certainly not AC/DC - this is a quick cash-in record. On this soundtrack to Stephen King's Maximum Overdrive, we get three crappy new songs (Title track, instrumentals D.T. and Chase the Ace), as well as a selection of songs that can be found elsewhere: the even-worse Sink the Pink and Shake Your Foundations (Both off of Fly on the Wall) as well as a few older, much-better AC/DC tunes (Ride On, You Shook Me All Night Long, Hells Bells, For Those About to Rock) that are best heard on their original albums (yes, this is worse than For Those About to Rock). And I know that this is supposed to be a pseudo-compilation. In that case, more from the Bon Scott era would be necessary. Avoid."
4,"Great compliation of tunes, but where the hell is the score?","This was the ""soundtrack"" album for Stephen King's classic turkey Maximum Overdrive, but sadly the emphasis was put on the songs. Don't get me wrong, I love them. But I would have loved to hear Angus's rockin' guitar riffs from the movie as well. D.T. and Chase the Ace only wet the throat, but they don't quench the thrist. Too bad."
3,"Good, but unnecessary","A decent album, released as a movie soundtrack, and including mostly previously released material. But, since most of it can be found elsewhere, there's not really a good reason to own this one. Maybe if you REALLY like ""Who Made Who""..."
3,overrated,"Everyone seems to be going on about how great of an album Who Made Who is. Dont get me wrong- AC/DC is one of my all time favorite bands, but this album is one of, if not, their absolute worst. ""Who Made Who"" has sort of that ""eighties"" feel to it, and any real AC/DC fan would already have all the tracks on it that were previously released. I strongly recommend Back in Black or Highway to Hell."
5,This is one of the best CD's,"I think this is just one of the best AC/DC Cd's there is. All though they had alot i sugest you get this one ""IT RULES""."
5,I enjoyed this more than Back in Black!,Who Made Who is a great song. I also like D.T. It's worth the money! Trust me!!
1,What's the point in buying this??,"I have all AC/DC albums, including the australian versions of High Voltage, TNT and DIrty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap. The only album I don't own is exactly this one here!!WHO MADE WHO is neither a greatest hits compilation nor a soundtrack of entirely new material. It's just about 3 inedit songs, mixed with such utterly bad filler songs from the FLY ON THE WALL album (""Sink The Pink"" and ""Shake Your Foundations""), along with their most famous song in the US, ""You Shook Me All NIght Long"", more ""Hells Bells"" (another track from Back In Black), along with ""Fot THose ABout To Rock"" and one Bon Scott-sung song, the great and immortal ""Ride On"".So, by the price of a whole album, you're buying just three new songs, and the rest is NOT a compilation, because the songs are thrown in there just to make a total of nine songs, regardless of quality or whatever, what is made clear by the inclusion of the FLY ON THE WALL tunes!!"
2,Who Made What??,"When you think AC/DC, you are thinking ""Back In Black"", ""Whole Lotta Rosie"", ""TNT"" and ""For Those About to Rock""... not movie soundtrack score. But, that's what you get with ""Who Made Who"" which was essentially the soundtrack for Stephen King's ""Maximum Overdrive"". In the context of the movie, the score Angus and the boys put together totally works... on it's own, it's just kinda blah instrumentals (save a couple of exceptions). Do yourself a favor and just buy the title track as a single... that song does rock!Top Tracks: Who Made Who"
4,A pretty good AC/DC cd,"This is a pretty good AC/DC album. Actually it isn't an album, it is a soundtrack to Stephen King's Maximum Overdrive. IF you own most of AC/DC's albums then you mite not want to bother with this CD because most if the songs are taken from there other albums, such as ""Hells Bells"", ""Shake Your Foundations"", and ""We Salute You"". But there ARE 3 new songs, 2 of which are instrumentals, ""DT"" ""Chase the Ace"" and ""Who Made Who"". It is a pretty good album though, and if you have a collection, or are looking for a good AC/DC retrospect, I would reccomend Who Made Who."
5,Each disk comes with a disk case.,"I bought these specifically because these comes with a disk case for each disk. The disk case are slim (much slimmer than music CD cases) which reduces the form factor.I have used 8 out of 10 disks to write/re-write ISO files and they work great. Just remember to use these for DVD RW that can support 4X speeds.Pros:1)Each disk comes with a slim case.2)Reliable and it works (8 out of 10 disks have worked flawlessly; the remaining 2 have not been used yet).Cons:1)The price of DVD-RW has been rising in the last 5 years. Maybe this is due to the fact that disks are no longer used to read/write large amount of data as much as it used to.Conclusion: If you want a reliable DVD-RW disks with a separate case, I recommend this product."
1,"Coasters, coasters, and more coasters.","Foolishly I took the reviewers on this product at their word and ordered these instead of my usual beloved Verbatims. Why, I can't imagine. So if you're thinking about buying these -- DON'T! I actually believe these other reviewers are shills for Sony. What other explanation could there be seeing as only one out of ten has given me more than one recording. I'm thinking about never buying another Sony product. Of any sort. Ever."
2,BUYER BEWARE,"I ordered these DVD's when they appeared after I ordered the Sony Handycam. They are just normal DVD's and do not fit in the Handycam. I am sure that they are great for transferring but, they are not the right size for the camcorder. Maybe I didn't read the information correctly but, I think it was a misrepresentation to display these in attachment with the Handycam. I had to buy the actual small disks that go into the recorder. BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!"
4,I have a question about the product,I have a question about these product..i saw that you have it in two colors..my question is how can i be sure that i will get the blue one when i buy it ??..Thanx
4,Great ... but why PLASTIC???,"This came with the two chins I adopted but when I got it, it had been chewed all over! It IS plastic and plastic is VERY bad for chinchillas so IDK why they even sell products like this. Just make sure if you buy one the chins only use it under CONSTANT/CLOSE supervision! It has seems do very well(both of the chins fit inside) and it holds enough dust! It serves it's purpose!"
3,Lasted a couple of years,"Lasted a couple of years before the hooks that connected it to the cage broke. I mostly used the hooks for stabilizing while it was resting on something, but I did sometimes hang it completely on the hooks. It's annoying not having them now because the house ends up all over the place now. Otherwise worked well. My chin likes it better when the flat side down though."
4,wish I can pick the color,"product was as advertised, but I sure wish I could pick the color. The size is big enough for a adult chinchilla and they sure don't care about the color"
5,Panasonic DVR,"I have been using the Panasonic DMR-EH55S for about 6 months. I have found my new experience with this DVR (vs VCR) to be extemely positive. I found it easy and straight forward to setup and use on a routine basis. I cannot, however, imagine using a DVR without a big Hard Drive. I believe I can recommend this model very highly."
4,Somewhat Satisfied.,I've had this unit for about 3 months. Everything worked great initially. The TV Guide is not keeping up on updating. The TV Guide is down to only having the next 12 hours instead of 8 days. I've read that other people have the same problem. Also changing channels is slow and there is no go back button to jump back to the previous channel.Everything else on the unit works great.
3,How to record and playback widescreen(16:9)?,"No matter what I do,I cannot get this unit to record or playback widescreen.I have a Comcast Cable box and I used the cable box to DVR to TV hookup.Panasonic tech,well just forget it!I used all RCA cables (red,white,yellow) for hookup.When I try to record a HD program I get black bars all around the screen.And yes my hi-speed record feature is off.The only way I have ever gotten WS is by using the TV fill/zoom feature.Anybody w/any ideas?Bob T.Greensburg,Pa"
1,DVD Recorder,"I sent this to my daughter as a gift. It was sent from J and R Music. She is definitely a techie, but had problems from the start. She spent many hours on the phone with tech support, but it never worked. She wound up sending it back. I hope I get my money refunded quickly."
5,Best of both Worlds....,"Just received and started to use this recorder. So far it combines the best of HDD and DVD recording.Install was straight forward if you have hooked up other recording devices before.The Gemstar/TV Guide in my area is out-of-date due to Comcast -> Time Warner swithover. Hopefully, in time that will be taken care of.The options for burning to removeable media are tremendous.Will post more info with more expierence with the product."
1,DirectTV HD satellite buyers beware!!!!!!,"After 3 phone calls to Panasonic, they finally told me that this unit will not set up TV Guide if you have a DirectTV HD satellite receiver. They tell me that TV Guide is working on fixing this problem, but no timetable was given. Also, it will not record HD quality programming even if you bypass the TV Guide to record HD programming. No where is this explained or noted before you purchase this item."
2,"When it works, it's great however...","I bought this unit a year ago to replace the panasonic DMRE85HS - which froze up after two years of use.When it works, I really like it. However it is really really annoying when it decides not to record a program - about 10-15% of the time.I check to make sure the system is setup to record a program, however it will record 5 seconds and then stop. This is true for both recordings selected using the TV guide, and programs manually setup to record on a particular channel at a predetermined time.This leads to disappointments once or twice a week. Which at the $428 price I paid a year ago for this unit from Amazon, is frustrating.I am astounded they are now asking close to $2000 for a new unit!"
4,DMR E55H,"I was successful in downloading the TV Guide, although last minute broadcasting changes will not be updated. You must use input 3 and have the dvd recorder parameters set-up for your satellite box. No, you cannot use HD receivers but I was able to connect with a standard DirecTV TiVo unit. I also have the DMR E55H controlling the channels on my DirecTV TiVo unit from the scheduling as well as direct channel access. The TiVO unit must remain on at all times!"
2,Not Picture Quality I Expected,"Dubbing DV footage via the DV input, recording ESPN highlights show, dubbing tapes via the composite inputs; I had picture breakup and 'pixels' too many ruining my DVDs. This unit is NOT for archiving or any serious DVD recording. If you can live with inferior picture quality you should spend way less. I was ripped off."
3,"Great features, BUT...","The Panasonice DMR - EH 55S DVD recorder is a sweet product. I especially love having the 200 GB of hard drive space for recording. But having used TIVO, the TV Guide recording menus don't come close. So, don't expect TIVO features like wishlists and two week scheduling. Another quirk is that the TV Guide may not list all the stations that you recieve in your area. For example, here in Portland, Oregon, ESPN 2 HD is channel 736 but TV guide on the panasonic did not program it in. So, obviously I cannot record anything on 736. But the HDMI, SD Card and DV inputs are very nice features to have."
2,"Good Work, but dated.","This would have been an excellent survey of American poets thirty years ago. But now it's a little bit dated. First, it does not contain any American poets since then. Second, it seems to have been written before the revolution in recent decades which brought some previously ignored poets of high caliber, but not white male enough to fame. For instance, Langston Hughes is clearly one of America's major poets, who had been around for decades before this book was published, but it includes nothing about him. The work that is included is clearly excellent, but there are plenty of better anthologies available now."
5,Lean Healthcare Pocket Reference,"Love this for Lean/Six-Sigma reference as a whole, healthcare related or not. Very well done, everyone likes these so much, I constantly have to keep an extra on hand. We started handing them out at our Lean/Six-sigma in house training they were so popular. Now is seems I see them in the pockets of all sorts of workers in the hospital."
5,Gordimer quietly exposes South Africa,"If you want real African literature, skip Poisonwood Bible, and read Nadine Gordimer's Lying Days. She powerfully reveals the many layers of South African life back in the days of the Struggle without advancing her own political agenda or point of view. Gordimer's unabashed prose will break your soul with its brilliant clarity and eloquence."
2,Outdated,"This collection of articles attempts to discuss some of the issues of distance learning today. It's a hit and miss collection, though. Perhaps the most useful are the articles on providing learner support, but these are offset by some severely out-of-date technology issues. The technology recommendations are museum relics (enjoy screenshots from Windows 3.1), and the reality of technology in education is a bit different than is described here. To add to the irritation, you have to read pre-tech-bubble type articles in which the coming ""information superhighway"" will solve most of the problems in distance education. That sort of pollyannaism has proven to be a little overly-optimistic. Skip this book and find a more up-to-date one."
5,Brilliant...Wade into the Wonder of this Woman's Work...,"Willing to Wait was my first experience of Melissa Ferrick, and I would venture to say that it is the best introduction available. This album works great as a pick-me-up when you're down...intelligent, at times light-hearted...gentle, yet prodding you to get back on your feet. On the other hand, it provides a nice respite from the daily chaos. If you're trying to decide on a Melissa Ferrick album through which to get acquainted, this is the one for you. Massive Blur just won't do the trick the way this one will. Check out ""I Am Not"" and ""Cracker Jack Kid"" and you'll be hooked. In the endless search for truly great music, Willing to Wait, for me, was definitely worth waiting for. Be happy you've discovered it..."
2,Depends on What You Want it For,"This book was required reading for a Medieval Literature class. I find it useless. It provides synonyms for words like ""seven"" or ""wife""--things anyone with the most basic knowledge of English should already know. But for words like ""hie"" or ""meed""--archaic words that are no longer in common use today...there's nothing. If you want to know what those words mean, then ""hie"" thee to a dictionary, because this book is no bleeding good. I hope they'll take it back. The free Kindle edition is roughly the same translation and doesn't claim to provide meanings, so there I know where I stand."
1,Too many chemicals,I had no way to check the ingredient list before purchase. I will be giving this product away and will not purchase this again. I use other Schwarkopf products successfully and would recommend them such as the non-ammonia Essensity color developer and hair colors.
4,Imperative Reaction - Ruined,"This is a really great CD, a nice mix of electro-industrial and alternative rock, something you would be likely hear on alternative radio if it wasn't for the electronics, oh, and the fact that they don't sound like everyone else. There are some really stand-out songs that showcase a ton of emotion in the singer's voice. The lyrics are excellent for the most part, and the music crosses the gambit from mind-blowing to mundane. Ruined isn't perfect but for the most part it comes across as a shining example of doing something different can really sound great and not sound like selling out. (*Cough, Apoptygma Berzerk, Cough*)"
5,Achtung!,"I first came across this group when a friend of mine bought ""Learning English"" I stumbled across this CD years later and was blown away by the quality. They've translated they're German songs into english (except Wunsch Dir Was) and they sound great. If you like heavy Punk music, this is the album for you."
3,"Good Service, Good Quality, Short in Size",This battery is a little bit smaller than my oringinal Panasonic FZ10 battery. I need to put some paper to squeez things up in the chamber.
4,Green Monsters,"""Asterix and the Roman Agent"" is a psychological story, mostly set in the village. Jealousy is made when a man, a Roman Agent, comes to the village on Vitalstatistix's birthday and gives Asterix a vase."
3,Americans beware of the size difference!,"Indeed, this is a beautiful dress and very expertly made. However, Asian sizes are totally different from American sizes -- the XL I ordered maybe would have fit a size 4 person, most likely smaller. Beware! USE THE SIZE CHART!!! Turns out I need a 4XL according to Asian measurements."
3,Nice read but left wanting more,"I eagerly approached ""The Evening Crowd at Kirmser's"" excited for a peek into gay life in the 40's in mid-America. While I found it a pleasant and intereresting read I felt myself wanting more. After reading it I found myself wishing that Ricardo Brown had gone deeper and into more depth about some of the people who frequented Kirmser's. Instead he often skimmed the surface leaving me wanting more."
4,A nice look back at gay life,It must have been extremely difficult to be gay in the 1940's yet the characters in the book seemed to find a way to live their lives being true to themselves. I hope that with all the freedoms that the gay community has now that they appreciate what they have and live as good of a life that the Kirmser folks did.
4,"an important document, but disjointed","I couldn't help but feel empathy for the author in facing the difficulty of his life, but at the same time the stories seem somewhat disjointed. There is no compelling narrative- only snapshots that illuminate various characters and traditions- like taking a figurine from the shelf, inspecting it, and putting it back. Each segment underlines the reality of gay existence before stonewall, but I also felt a certain lack of emotion in the writing- more of a filtered look at the past, than an open examination of what constructed the being. But perhaps the detachment I felt in the author's telling was what makes the book poignent- even after so many years, he still couldn't face the emotions he kept so dutifully bottled thanks to society's conventions. I can only imagine the pain, the loneliness, the heartbreak that was excised and lies obscured under the text."
1,It would've been better had it not come back to him at all,"The title of this CD should have been ""David Crosby meets Big Mama Thornton"".The ""gruff"" vocal techinque (for lack of a better term) that David Crosby employs in this recording completely ruins what could have been some fine live interpretations of some of his greatest music.For those of you who love the sweetness and subtlety of David Crosby's voice, you're not going to find it here. I was deeply disappointed upon listening to this recording.Crosby's work on his 1971 masterpiece ""If I Could Only Remember My Name"" will forever remain the pinnacle of his solo output, much like Ian McDonald & Michael Giles' ""McDonald & Giles"" and Chris Squire's ""Fish Out Of Water"".It is very difficult, if not impossible, to surpass perfection. And ""If I Could Only Remember My Name"" was exactly that - perfection."
4,Great Album-Superb,"David Crosby shines in this live performance. I was skeptical, how many times can I listen to the CSN songs. But, this album is worth a listen. The tracks are very clear and sharp, and his voice is strong. Chris Robinson from the Black Crowes, and Jeff Pevar form CPR days, makes an appearance. I would strongly recommend if your a fan of Crosby's solo efforts."
4,Fun!!!,"David Crosby is fantastic! He sounds better now than he did when this was done, but still this is a great live album! I highly recommend if you want to have fun listening to a spontaneous, creative song list. Very few people can sing like this man can, I have seen him on stage twice in the last 3 years and his voice is so intense he can loosen your fillings, I know from experience! This album will get you going early in the morning, Graham Nash and the singer from the Black Crows join him at the end of the show.Great!"
4,"Mancini ""scores"" again.","Henry Mancini was the perfect choice to score this movie as he captured the essence of San Francisco and the elements of a teriffic film. There are many different types of music in this soundtrack based on the elements of the film and as usual, Mancini captures all of them. Be prepared for a lot of different sounds but both Jazz and Blues are the heart of what Mancini does best. A great album and a great film."
4,"Hold on, this is for real!!","A brilliant read. I couldn't get to sleep. Not because I was affect adversely from its contents, but because I could not put it down. Watching the unveiling of the real world research is exciting when it is described so clearly and researched with such gusto. Well done Mr Chown!"
4,"hang on, what door?","Great book, easy to read, simple to understand. Should be taken alongside Green and Hawking and then used to build a wormhole.I'd really like to scoot forward 50yrs and see if any of these ideas proved to be correct...."
3,Liked it more toward the end.,"I felt like I was reading a drawnout artical in a journal at first. Another problem I had with Mr.Chown's book was his repitious style. However, toward the end (around page 110 ) he starts to present us with some interesting theories and mindblowing ideas. Parallel universes,panspermia(seeded life from space),time-travel, and infinite dimensions make-up for the tedious start. There are no pictures or diagrams, but there is a glossary in back."
3,"The drums are great, but...","Drumming fans: buy it! Big band fans: use caution. This album is a great exhibition of chops and mastery of the skins. However the ensemble that accompanies those traps reminds me of an upstart junior college jazz band trying to impress the festival judges. Most of the charts on this collection are up-tempo jams with straight-forward, driving beats that allow the various drummers to display their abilities, which they all admirably accomplish. What I grew tired of was the especially blatty, screaching trumpets that often sounded like Maynard Ferguson wannabees that disrupted the album throughout. This album is worth listening to and owning for the exhibition it offers drumming fans, but big band/swing fans should take advantage of the samples provided before jumping in."
4,Burning for Buddy Vol. I,This is a great recording if you like bona-fide big band without the crackle of the 40's and 50's and also without the overprocessing so many newer recordings suffer from. I really enjoyed this!
2,Highschool time on this cd,"Neil Peart should have played his own material on this cd. His playing sounds like a an intermediate student at highschool level.The bottom line is, nobody can pay like Buddy. Nobody can handle a big band like Buddy.The only player who comes close on these videos / cd sets is Louis Bellson."
1,Shiping problems:(,"The cds were send two months ago, by a normal shiping method(the cheapest way) and they are still somewhere in the system. I offer not to choose the normal shiping if you live in europe..."
3,Car's Toy Bin,"This toy organizer is ok. I don't think it was worth the hassle of trying to find it. It was a lot smaller than I thought it would be. The bins don't fit on the shelves very well. The wooden rods that the bins sit on are not angled properly, so the bins tend to slide right out if you're not very careful with them. Had I known all this before I purchased this item, I probably wouldn't have purchased it. My son is thrilled with all the cars stuff on it though."
3,"good craftmanship, but the containers are really small",I guess I did not read the specifications too well on this one because I was quite disappointed in how small the 9 containers were.
2,Not all original recordings,This CD is a mish-mash of some original recordings and some re-recordings even though there is nothing mentioned anywhere in the packaging. Buy at your own risk!
2,Overpriced,"I check BestBuys offer too late. They sell the same item, or same type, for 50% less. It is a sad reminder that Amazon does not have always the best price."
4,Review of evidence relating to immortality-1974,"The author presents a systematic review of the evidence. Topical chapters cover evidence from mediumship, apparitions, astral travel, NDEs, threshold experiences, death ""coincidences"" and past life memories. The sources are cited in footnotes and the book is indexed. Allen is a Canadian journalist specializing in psychic phenomena and has been published extensively."
1,Item not as pictured,What you see in the photo is a nice enough looking stem. It actually looks polished. What you get is the ugliest chunk of metal I've ever seen. I would never put that on my bike. It looks like to pieces of metal that were shoddily welded together then spayed with some chrome. It's awful. Don't buy it. I'd send it back but it's not worth the time. I'm going to give it away to the local bike collective. They might be able to find a home for it. uhg! Nothing is worse than thinking you got a deal on a piece of equipment then you get the ol' bait-n-switch.
1,WORST DRUM THRONE EVER,"So i have been playing drums for about 10 years now and have used many different thrones. My last throne was a pretty standard Tama throne and every day I sit on this throne I miss my old Tama. This throne spins for height adjustment, which at first you think isn't that bad but after time goes on you realize that it is more of a pain then what it is worth. To get it to the right height you have to sit over it and spin it like a retard. You're better off just buying something else...THE WORST PART ABOUT THIS IS:I was playing my drums one day and I leaned over to pick something up and the mounts underneath the seat that is connected to the hardware snapped like a twig. This was way beyond repair. I am by no means a small guy (230 lbs) but my old Tama throne took a beating 10X worse then this seat and never even flinched. The motorcycle style doesn't do anything special either. Stick with the standard round seat."
5,Perfect fit,"This strut is a perfect fit for my 1998 DeVille. It was purchased because the rubber bushings in the strut that a mechanic put in 5 years ago had deteriorated and were GONE. While I was replacing this one, I replaced the one on the other side because the conditions are the same under the hood, and when one 'fails', the other one will 'fail' soon.The bushings are integral to the strut, so they alone could not be replaced even though that was the ONLY problem with the original strut. I could not locate any bushings at any of the parts companies.The price at Amazon was about half of what the blue-and-yellow national auto parts store wanted for them."
5,One of the ten greatest albums of the 1990s,"This is absolutely the most cohesive tribute album ever assembled, no doubt a result of Rainer's playing on most of the tracks. Throughout the album, Ptacek's National Steel slides and plunks along so thick you can almost taste it, and it's delicious. Brought together by Robert Plant and Howe Gelb, the album's contributors all do a magnificent job of adding their own souls to Ptacek's deeply personal music. Rainer Ptacek passed away a few months after the album was released, and this only adds to the haunting aura of the music. The last line of his statement of thanks in the liner notes reads, ""I AM STILL REMAINING"", and thanks to this collection, he will always remain a part of the heart of anyone fortunate enough to hear his songs."
3,OK but too long,"Interesting insights into the formation of the Stones, Bill's early life and the interplay of the members. I did find it a bit long and ...unemotional. It seems that Bill kept copious notes and just put those notes into chronological order to write this book."
2,Review of Stone Alone,"This is an account of the Stones, from each's day of birth to the death of Brian Jones.After a while it gets repetitive with all the places they played, all the girls he's been with and all his bank statements. Although it does give some inside info about the Stones such as the divisions inside the group there really isn't anything new a fan wouldn't already know. One thing I found interesting is why Ian Stewart was never included in pictures on covers. Other than that, a pretty uninteresting book."
3,some interesting stories,"enjoyed reading this book, for its glimpses into the stones' inner world. much here about brian jones, who is quite the fascinating character, and who sadly is not given all his due in other stories about the stones. many things i did not realize, here. very worth reading for serious stones fans. i miss seeing bill playing with the stones, but here is a chance to find out what else he did. and how he got started with them in the first place. i really don't care how many hundreds of women he had relations with, but he will tell you anyway."
2,poor job,Bill Wyman chose the wrong writer. How can the story of the Rolling Stones be so boring? Would make you never want to read another rock biography again. What is worth reading could be reduced by 2/3s. Stale.
2,dull,"This book reminds me of what Truman Capote said about Saul Bellow: ""He's a dull writer and a dull man."" (And I know this was ghost writen, but it still holds)."
2,Not that great,"Mario Party could have been a great game if it was just eaiser. The computer always wins, and my brother got a blister on the tug-a-war mini-game. The game takes forever, so unless you having a sleepover, you really don't want to get it. DON'T BUY THIS GAME. RENT IT FOR A BRITHDAY PARTY. I did give it 2 stars however, because some of the mini-games were fun, and the game is a good party game, but stinks as a one-player game."
4,Mario Party,"Excellent competitive game with two to four players. A little boring by yourself, bit otherwise an excellent overall choice. I haven't met anyone yet who didn't enjoy playing at least once."
3,Board games,"The reason I gave this game 3 stars is because there's not much action. Well there is some action, but at the end of every turn.So I say this is not a cup of tea for people who like action (if you like tea)."
5,Just the way I remember,"I got bored of my other Mario Party games since there was no challenge in them anymore. I grabbed this one because I remember the actual challenge it had to play, and now it is more fun than I remember. I guess this is what happens when you go back and play an older game from your childhood."
4,Takes me back to the good ol days!,"This is a great game. I played it a lot growing up and it's been great to get to relive that time. It's enjoyable because its like getting out a board game with your friends, only it includes exciting new twists. I definitely plan on collecting the successive Mario Partys as well!"
2,Mario Party Pooper,"I thought this game was really fun at first - if you are playing with another person - but then I realised that behind all that game playing and luck and excitement... it gets realy boring after a while. In fact, I think I got bored of it within 3 - 5 days. I think this is a game to rent, not buy. It's really not worth the money. Well, it's not my choice of whether you should buy this or not, but this is my opinion. Okay, bye!"
2,FUnnn....nnnOT!,"This game takes FOREVER! If you play with one person, it is no fun at all. If you play with two or three people, the computer always wins. It was a real waste of my money, considering that Mario Party 2 came out later. The graphics are OK i guess, it is not frusterating at all because it takes really long. If you love to fidget, this is not your game, buddy."
2,Great Game,"At first I didnt like this game, then I got into it. It's like an electic boardgame. The one thing I hate is playing against the consol. Always play with four real people."
5,Awesome!,"This game is one of my favorite Nintendo games. A really fun fighting game with colorful levels, cool charecters, great techniques, and sweet items that help you defeat your opponents a little easier. I've never played one player mode, but I know two player mode is AWESOME! I have so much fun versing my cousins! My favorite charecter is Kirby. You can play as charecters from lots of different games, including Mario, Kirby, Pok'emon, and more!I would HIGHLY recommend this game to any Mario fan, or anyoen looking for a good game!"
3,Mario Dissapointment,"Mario Party 64 is not a great game. It has only limited levels, so the replay value is not very great, and the sound is pretty annoying, this game would have gotten four stars, but the excessive game time blew the extra star away; the shortest number of turns you can play is 20, which takes more than 45 minutes."
3,"Awesome, but painful game","I love every Mario Party game. They are great games to play with a small group of friends. You have to play the game a lot before you can get sick of it, which is nice. This one is very silimar to the other five Mario party games that are out right now. Personally, this one is my least favorite of the 6. In some of the minigames, you need to spin the joystick in circles VERY fast to win...I guess if you don't get too into the game it'd be alright, however I played too many of the spinning games in a row and I had a pretty big, not to mention painful, blister in the middle of my hand for a week or so and was handicapped from playing for a little while. I would advise people to buy a sequel to Mario Party if you enjoy painfree gaming."
5,WOW:):):):):):):):):):):):):):),"This game is action packed fun! It is fun to play with 1,2,3, or 4 players. It has great mini games, and many different styles of board games. The mini games are the best part of the game. Everyone gets to participate in them, and there are a lot of mini games to choose from. I highly recommend you to buy this game."
1,Mario Party,An extremely poor game. Very hard on your controllers. The spinning of the joysticks in some of the mini-games makes the joysticks loose and un-responsive. Buy at your own risk.
1,This game was so bad I sent it back to the store.,"This game is horrible. First, I bought this video ""game"" because I thought it was fun. Well in wasn't. 1st, the graphics are poor. 2nd the computer's difficulty level is so hard. If you play with one, two, or three people, you always lose. The computer is WAY more expirenced than a human will ever be, and it just degrades from the fun factor. So ignore the reviews that say it is so great. They are overexxagerating. My 8-year-old brother got bored with it in 3 hours."
1,One of the lamest games out there!,"Video games have always been a big dispointment to me. In this game we have Mario and the gang going through silly mazes, races, and they even have sack racing! I've seen the previews for this game, and it looked very childish! One of the lamest games since Sonic Adventure for Sega Dreamcast!Also, the characters in this game all walk, run, and bounce around like Teletubbies! If you have a 5 or 6 year old he/she might like this one! It's for little kids to enjoy!"
1,This game doesn't work....,"This game doesn't work,I bought it used...it was packaged very well though...We have a very upset son here....I am letting you know so that you can test the games before you send them to other people..."
2,Can get boring,"If you are new to Mario party games, check out number 2 or 3. This is fun to begin with but when you keep playing the same mini-games it gets a little boring. We rented this and and liked the concept but didn't enjoy it much but when Mario Party 2 came out and it stated it had more mini-games we bought that one and we really enjoyed it. We can't wait to get the 3rd one. No matter what game you go with expect to play for atleast an hour."
2,Not Very High-Quality Game,"Well this game isnt exactly the party it was cracked up to be! Its just this board game type thing where you play against the computer or friends and when you all land on a space you play these mini-games, some of them are fun, some are pretty dumb (and some are absolutly impossible if you play against the computer, there like programed to do everything perfectly!) Its terrible graphics also, doesnt look like a N64 game, more like a super nintendo game! I suggest you rent it b4 you invest to buy it!"
4,Very Good Book!,"I very much like the way Talmage wrote this book, gives you better understanding of how the Great Apostasy really happened. I would reccommend this to everyone, LDS and Non-LDS alike. I would also reccomend ""Restoring the Ancient Church, Joseph Smith and ancient Christianity"" very good book on the apostasy and the writings of Christians around the time Christ lived and the apostasy!!!"
2,Okay,"Maybe this collection serves best as a testimony to how much Nancy Willard has progressed since her first collection. These are doty, sentimental poems that give no hint of the considerable talent she displayed later. There are some interesting images here, but nothing that readers wouldn't see from the average poet. I think Willard writes best when she does take-offs on other poets--then her talent springs into being. I would recommend everything she's written except this."
1,Title Doesn't Match Book,I have a son with Asperger's and he also has Tourette's. I bought this book based on the title as we deal with a lot of behavior and learning issues and I home school him. I was expecting to get some advise and explainations for the problems we deal with but it's just a bunch of research and much of it is repeated from chapter to chapter. I'm very disappointed in this book as it deals very little with learning and behavior. It's just a compilation of many different research papers. I've read plenty of those. I regret buying this book.
2,Little over my head,I bought this book along with several others at the same time. I just glanced though this book. It is not a easy to read book. Kind of like a text book for college. With a IEP meeting coming up I had to put it on the backburner. Some of the others I got were much easier to read and to give to others to read.
3,Won't use,"It's too hard to get the cookie dough out of the cutter without messing up the shape. They're too small to work with. I'll use occassionally when I have lots of time, just to give the cookie platter the look I want, but the larger cookie cutters are much better."
1,What kind of nonsense is this?,I am not referring to the CD but the review by Herbert S. Philbrick. This guy has heard one track on a radio program and he puts in a 3 star place holder? People make buying desicions based on these reviews. Herbert S. Philbrick needs a dose of responsibility....
3,All the things you are,"I've only heard this song on radio and have not yet obtained the complete album.It begins in the fashion of JS Bach / John Lewis and, given that it is already a pretty song, the performance is melodic. After the classical 1st choruses, the group goes into a solid swing. With Joe Morello, failure is not an option.Having only heard the one song, the 3 star rating is just a default place holder."
2,Does the job.,"This hamster cage is terribly noisy. The cage is so noisy that I have to move it to the living room. It does the job, which is minimal and pretty much expected. The cage is pretty flimsy and the parts fit loosely on. Cleaning is convenient but it doesn't make the product good. I don't recommend this if you have/are planning on getting a Teddy Bear(Syrian) hamster because its just not big enough. I do however, suggest that you just go with a good old fashion glass tank or if you really feel like shelling out the big bucks, get the HabiTrail OVO."
4,Great purchase!,"I have not had any problems with this cage, except for the water bottle. The water bottle is way to difficult to remove and put back when changing the water on a daily basis. I bought a new water bottle for $3 at my local pet store. I think this cage is totally worth the price despite the crappy water bottle. I have purchased two, one for my daughter's dwarf hamster and one for my niece's dwarf hamster and we love them! Super easy to take apart and clean, and we have bought some tube attachments that the hamsters enjoy! The wheel is not completely silent, but there's no squeaking, which I like. Plus, I just don't believe there's a hamster wheel out there that is completely silent. Overall, I am very satisfied with my purchase and would recommend this cage for someone with a dwarf hamster!"
4,Super Pet CritterTrail One Habitat- great purchase,"The product was exactly as described! The price was great, shipping not a problem. My daughter enjoys the habitat so much; it's perfect for her mouse and even I'm somewhat excited about buying more attachments for it. Thanks!"
3,Good Cage,"Good cage... the wheel makes noise and it's hard to put together but otherwise it's a decent amount of room and it's probably better if you get this cage only for a dwarf, gerbils, or mice...but it's fine for regular hamsters I just think regular hamsters would enjoy more room... would recommend this to a friend."
3,"Great starter home, but noisy!","We bought this 18 months ago, when we bought my daughter her first dwarf hamster. It worked just fine for him, for his entire life (which lasted almost exactly a year to the day we brought him home). He wasn't a very active hamster, and seemed kinda stupid. He never, ever ran on the wheel. It wasn't until we purchased another dwarf hamster that we discovered how noisy this plastic wheel is! So loud that we had to move him out of my daughter's room, as he would wake her up during the night. So loud that when he is running on his wheel, we can hear it throughout our 2000+sq. ft house, even if it is in a room with the door closed.We've helped our noise problem by giving him plenty of time in his roll-around ball, and by sometimes simply taking the wheel off the side of the cage.Other than the noisy wheel, I would recommend this set-up. It is easy to put together and take apart, so easy to clean."
1,Mouse can escape from this cage,"I bought this cage for my daughter's new pet mice. Less than an hour after the two mice were living in their new home, one crawled out around the door opening. The gap between the cage door and stationary wire was big enough for them to escape. There was no way to bed the wires closer together to fix this gap. Luckily the store exchanged the cage for another one since I discovered the problem so soon.I would not recommend this product to be used to house mice. It would be ok for a regular hamster or rat."
2,ok cage,"this is too small for a regular hamster to happily live in, so i connected it to another cage with the tubes. most of the critter trail stuff i had shipped to me, including all tubes, were broken. they were easy to repair, but some are permanently stuck shut now and others fall apart easily. and they're pretty hard to clean. maybe it would be better for mice or mini gerbils."
2,"If you're a completist, fine, but...","Sonnyboy is past his prime on this recording, and Clapton has not yet found his tone, riffs, or confidence, so the two main reasons to get this cd are no reasons at all."
5,A Gundam Classic,This is by far one of the best Gundam series I have ever seen. This final volume ends the series off with a bang as Domon Kasshu goes face to face with Master Asia and the Dark Gundam (Devil Gundam).The battles with Domon Kasshu and his teammates are absolutely a must see. They set the standard for what Gundam battles should look like.I really appreciated the nice plot twists that managed to pop up around the last remaining episodes. They defintely made the series a whole lot more engaging.Pick this series up! You will not be disappointed.
2,Oliver,I have all of the oliver dvd and this one only rank in at number 2 soon i'll love to place my dvd on amazon and I have over 100 different titles lot of jamaican comedy lot better than big yard so please inform me how to get these titles to you
2,Teeny Bopper Baloney,"Jennifer Love Hewitt can stick to giggling and ""acting"" but this cd was a tad to much for me. Yes, I think that ""Lets go bang"" has a good beat and we could all dance to it, but come on. This cd's target audience is about 7-11 years old!"
4,"Besides being beautiful, she also sings!","And with a great voice! This album is Madonna-of-the-80's style, with many dance songs. In some moments of it, if you close your eyes, you may think it's Madonna singing, but when you look at the cover of the CD, you'll see a prettier face. Romantic tracks like ""Couldn't Find Another Man"", ""In Another Life"", ""Everywhere I Go"" will please most of the listeners. ""You Make Me Smile"" is the best song in the album, JLH sings like the succesful middle-aged ladies of the romantic music scene, and the background-sang melody is surprisingly creative. Percussionist Sheila E. appears on the title track, which is a plus."
2,better than the next.....,"I thought one of the songs in this cd showed the side of jennifer that i see, a person who is soulful,a real earth girl! Although the song wasn't that great, i know she can do better! I can tell she is still trying to find herself in the music bizz. by the way she changes her style. It's suttle but if your a real music fan you know what i'm talking about! p.s. wish i could sing like her!"
1,"JLH songs need lots of work. Some advice, stick to acting.",JLH needs to wake up because she is so not in the 90's. The CD is called awful. This may seem to harsh but get real it is a wake up call.
1,Not honourable--A pity,"The quality of ""music"" is simply poor and monotonous. I am embarrassed that my seven year old niece takes pleasure in listening to it. But I guess that's the type of market Hewitt attracts. Perhaps a guest shot on Bananas in Pajamas will give her the right career move."
5,"First CD I heard by Love, and I fell in love",I love every track on this CD especially tracks 6 and 10. Love is a great singer and she looks like a million bucks.
1,A mistake to buy!,"I really like ""Love"", and I bought this CD because I really enjoyed her sophmore album. However I was really disappointed when I listened to this cd. The quality of the music itself was poor. A lot of loud music in the background and not enough concentration on the vocals. She has a killer voice, but you can tell she was just a young girl when she recorded this album. I would definitely recomment buying her latest album! It is a HUGE improvement over this sad attempt at music. Luckily the music store I bought it from let me return it the next day! Even though it was open."
4,Adults and teens like this music,"We have raised our children on all types of music. We have some types of music we played a little more than others. Country music, 60's rock, 60's what we called bubble gum and hard rock from the 60's, current pop and rock and classical. So there is a wide range of music in our home. This album is an excellent album of really good tunes. We enjoy Jennifer as an actress and now as a singer. I recommend that anyone should buy this album as adults and teens will all enjoy her music."
1,Hmmmm?,"I've seen her CDs back in the day but had never become curious until now believe it or not...but based on what I've heard...she definitely could have used some better producers. That ""Let's Go Bang"" cut screams remnants of Janet Jackson's ""Rhythm Nation"" for starters...the rest of that record, is not worth discussing because overall, the production has done her minimal justice if any at all.She's definitely a pretty good singer, but ""Bless Her Heart"" she really needed to fire her manager after that and employed some much better producers. And that ladies and gentlemen is My 2 cents."
2,Um...it's Jennifer Love Hewitt...,"It's okay for what it is. Hewitt can carry a tune. Not the greatest singer to ever open her yapper, but far from the worst. The songs are mostly bland pop-filler, with lyrics that appear to have been 'researched' in a Hallmark greeting card aisle. Sadly, there is no nude centerfold of the singer, which might have raised the star rating to 3 or 4...if you're a 15 year old girl, the sentiments on this cd will probably resonate with you for days after listening to it."
3,Other album better,"The album, though good, shows less of her talent than usual(first album). Good beats, tempo okay, a little too repetative though. Suggestion: get her self-titled album. It's her second album and really shows her growth as a singer."
1,Wank.,"Absolute tosh of the lo-fiest order. Structureless caterwaulings with a substrata of faintly ridiculous, poorly-disciplined instrumentation. If this isn't not music, then I don't know what isn't. They all deserve a punch in the nose, and would make poor hamburger."
5,Sounds Like Black Rock City...,"Best compilation of early dub fusion you're likely to hear. Think ""Burningman"", and drift off into ........"
1,A Waste of Money ! (used with permission from Allan Sherman),"Gilbert Gottfried: Dirty Jokes, sure was one dirty joke, played on me and anyone else who purchases this genuine piece of crap. You should be ashamed of yourself."
2,just ok,I don't know. I remember watching this years ago and it was a lot funnier then. It says I need four more words so..........
3,"Oh come on, folks!","It's a nice enough record, and a bargain at two LPs plus, but to a tin-eared amateur like me it was a disappointment. Primarily that's because of Sam Woodyard, who with few exceptions plays his routine heavy two-beat bash throughout. With a drummer who actually listened, like the much-maligned Sonny Greer or Louis Bellson, the band might have loosened up.My impression is that Duke was playing out the string on his Reprise contract when he cut these, and he seems tired. There are high spots--he didn't take well to Stan Kenton's ""progressive"" claims, and Strayhorn's ""Artistry in Rhythm"" arrangement seems to reflect it. Johnny Hodges shines like a bright penny throughout, possibly because he didn't have to do his bill-shucking routine on Duke's copyrights. Enjoy, if you've enjoyed the Ellington originals first."
1,Disappointing purchase,"I chose this domino set because I don't want any colors or cartoon characters. I just wanted a basic domino set and have not been able to find one in the stores. I paid more for shipping than I did for the set, because I wanted one just like the photo online. The price was fair, but the set was a disappointment because the case is totally different and I hate it. Also, the dominos are too thin and don't look like the photo either. Apparently, it is a generic picture. So, it would make my shipping charges go up to 5 times the purchase price to return it. Guess I'll keep it."
3,You pay for what you get!,"The inexpensive price of these dominos despite the high shipping charge should be a dead give away. I have had no problems finding plenty of plain dominos on the internet.This set itself is on the smallish side though, but check out the Puremco website which has all kinds of dominos including a nice size standard ivory set with black spots. The tournament sized ones are great, although I personally would like to see some more unusual colors like yellow, orange and purple."
4,Great remaster of a good album,"If you already own this album, this remaster is definitely worthwhile, with the extra tracks worth the money. If you don't already own this album - it is an interesting mix of songs with vocals (mostly by guest vocalists) and prog-rock instrumentals (loud - don't expect the light acoustic instrumentals of Geese & The Ghost or Private Parts & Pieces: these are full-band instrumentals with power!) Probably the biggest variety of musical styles on a AP album with vocals (though I still prefer Wise After the Event as the ultimate AP album - also excellent in its remaster.)"
3,"Good Product, but Vendor said it was in stock when it actually was not.","This product works great. Strong magnetic bond, but not so strong you can't peel them away from the magnetic surface.Adorama said this product was in stock. I later got an email saying it was out of stock and delayed. The delay was only 2 days or so, but it is frustrating when the sale says ""in stock"" and it is erroneous information.So, for product, I'd give it 4 stars. 5 stars if the price was lower (a bit overpriced IMO).I'd give Adorama a 2.5- 3 star rating due to the erroneous sales information.Average came out to a 3 star rating for the whole purchase."
5,A thought-provoking analysis,"Heywood and Dworkin draw on a variety of sources in this thoughtful examination of female athletes, including content and textual analysis and critical and gender theory. Their writing is scholarly and thouroughly researched, yet will also be interesting to non-academic readers. The commentary on various advertisements and other cultural artifacts such as the movie ""Fight Club"" are very good, as are their explorations of the conumdrums and contradictions encountered by women athletes over how they represent themselves and are represented by others. They also touch more generally on how gender roles and images have changed, not just for women but for men as well.This is a must-read for women athletes, those who support them, and anyone interested in the topics of sports and gender.--Vince Prygoski, author of ""Worst to First, or, a 'Shock'ing tale of Women's Basketball in Motown"" (available from Amazon.com)"
2,re-think this shoe,"quite dissapointing. I returned them. They look cheap, feel cheap and run a full size to small."
5,Wrong author listed,"this is a great little 4-track CD of two brothers from the island of Ni'ihau. Malaki and (the late) Nahale Kanahele. It is available for $5 new from various sources on the internet. great music from these two guys. If you like Kekuhi Kanahele-Frias music, you will like this too. It's very authentic and very Hawaiian."
2,This man needs to open up his mind,"Although I enjoyed reading most of Stiebling's work, his writing is somewhat hypocritical. He criticizes modern far-fetched theories too much while many of his own theories are far-fetched themselves. Also, he makes assumptions, such as giving credit to Khufu as the builder of the Great Pyramid. This was proven wrong by Zecharia Sitchin in The Wars of Gods and Men. He gives credible issues a bad name. For example, he throws out the theory of ancient astronauts by only looking at the mistakes made by one researcher. If he would just open his mind and examine works such as those of Zecharia Sitchin, he may think differently. If you're interested in the other side of such issues as Noah's Ark and Atlantis, check out this book, but if you want something that doesn't just touch on the subject, find something else."
5,Great performance!! Deborah Harry is a star!!!!,"A must see!!! My fave movie of the year. Intersting, kinky, great performance by D.Harry!"
3,jaw dropping,"i hadn't seen this movie before when i decided to buy it, but adrien brody was in it and i've enjoyed all the movies i've seen with him. i have to say his acting in this was so convincing i had to laugh because his character reminded me of someone i knew. i couldn't even reconize adrien's personality while he played this strange character. the reason i only gave it three stars was because it was unneccessarily vivid in its violence and the plot didn't need to be that disguisting, especially the end. it seemed like the writer and director were trying too hard to get a rise out of people. i give adrien's performance five stars, but the movie just leaves you upset with the disturbing ending."
1,Take the 1 star rating... then minus 1.,"A friend of mine recommended this movie to me... I no longer class him as a friend. You know how some movies are soooo bad they're good, well this movie is sooooo bad its just terrible. I won't waste your time giving an in depth review ... just that that mother loves son, son becomes mixed up with gangsters, son gets girlfriend, mother disaproves of girlfriend, son shags mother. If this sounds kinky or interesting... its not. Badly written, acted, directed... my god words fail me as to how bad this movie is. AVOID!"
1,make that ZERO stars!!,"This is easily one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Not because it is (supposedly) ""disturbing"" or ""controversial""...there's nothing new here in that respect...but because it is a poorly written, filmed and acted piece of garbage. Don't waste time of money."
5,Perfect movie,"I have never been more shocked and delighted by one movie. ""Six ways"" is simply a perfect movie, the acting is great, the plot, the action, and the way the movie just flows. Debbie Harry and Norman Reedus make a perfect mother/son duo and their dialogue is scary yet entertaining. The movie borrows aspects from such classics as ""Psycho"" and ""Goodfellas"" but is original enough to be a classic on its own. This movie has everything that you could possibly want from a movie: violence, freaky sex, and great performances. If you haven't seen it you don't know what you're in for when you do!"
1,Nothing Beautiful About This Nightmare,"The music is awful, the vocals unintelligible. The band pretends to be death metal and fails atrociously."
2,Few Worthy Tracks,Stand-out tracks:3. Welcome (3/5)8. Foolin (5/5)11. The Right Way (4/5)14. Street Chronicles (5/5)
2,low level informations,"this book is only a conglomerate of informations from other books about yoga, taoism, alpha waves of brain, gemstones, castaneda's books and some shamanic books and only quite small part of book are infos that author acquire not from other books but from some real shamans. So this book is not vey authentic and is not worth 2$... It only may be usefull ,perhaps, for someone who didn't yet read other book about shamanism, yoga, taoism, esoterica..."
3,I hate rap,"The first time I heard CRR sing I Hate Rap, I thought it was just great. That was 2 years ago in concert. Since then we waited and waited and waited for their next release. I was told there were problems in production. Well, when I realized that they had finally released their latest album, I rushed out and got it. I have to say that I am greatly disappointed to what has been done to this song. I want to know if CRR was pressured into changing the song so that it might not be so politically incorrect? Can anyone answer that question for me? The rest of the CD is good, though I miss those songs that celebrate their Southern heritage. I look forward to their next concert near me."
1,It's lame,"I have always loveed confederate railroad, but recently it seems as though their just trying to make $ without producing good quality songs. They recently came out with a greatest hit after only 3 albums. This CD sounds more like a Cledus T. Judd album with songs like THE BIG ONE, I HATE RAP, and COWBOY CADILAC. When it comes down to it this cd just doesn't have any good songs on it. Your better off getting one of the first two ones or the greatest hits."
3,NOT THERE BEST,I would say that half the album is good the rest is mindless comical filler. Simple Man last cut on cd is well done and too bad there is not more like this song on the cd it would be a gem.
2,Please just stay with the Rippingtons,"Russ Freeman is the man, and I have a big respect for him. But this... it's just lacking of effort it seems. In my opinion he should've just dropped the idea of Drive and saved the interesting material on this CD to work into Let it Ripp. That really would've saved Let it Ripp, in my opinion (not to say it's a bad CD, but it had potential to be so much better). Cool in the Shade, Guitarland, and Drive are the only songs that really caught me, and those are all simply awesome songs. The rest to me just seems very lackluster and without much effort. He came out with two somewhat bland CDs less than one year apart when he could've just taken his time and made one great CD, but maybe I'm being overly critical. Just listen to the samples for yourself, and see what YOU think."
1,Boring.,"Currently Russ Freeman and the Rippingtons are suffering from a lack of fantasy,creativity,synergy and that shows in their latest CDs.What are you doing,Russ? Is Andi of any help?I think that the major mistake is to produce TWO albums ""Drive"" and 'Let it ripp"" which sound as two clones of the original beauty of the Rippingtons.The result is that TWO CDS are very blunt,dull and poor.Much better ONE CD only,but good,inspired and well crafted."
4,memory foam topper,"The memory foam was good, but not quite as expected. It was little more than the eggcrates you bring home from the hospital. The service was speedy, and the delivery even faster. It was my mistake for not researching the product better."
4,Novice to intermediate watercolorist,"This book serves as a good guide for those without extensive experience. Since painters frequently work from photographs, it gives guidance in how to approach a photo subject. The photos are also top notch, so that helps."
4,The big book of painting nature in watercolor. I likeit,Very instructive in every way landscape. Good book for beginner and intermediate. It shows prety much every type of scene and how to paint it..
5,Nice for all levels,"This book is a nice tutorial for different levels of painters looking for activities. Not super loose and not super overworked, the activities are a good primer for more complex paintings down the road. Good color pictures that are not too small. A good skill builder."
5,Excellent History of America's Care for the Poor,"I found this book to be very interesting and informative. The author does have a somewhat conservative political perspective (all of us have some bias). Therefore, some or many on the left will find fault with the book in some respects. Behind the political preference, there is much good historical information about how Americans attempted to care for the poor in this country in the past, and how the philosophical approach to caring for the poor has changed in the past 100 years. Until the early 1900's, the pervasive idea in America was that private organizations could best care for the poor, but also hold them accountable. However, the progressive idea of government run social programs took hold and grew in the 20th century."
1,Christians Christ Would Run Out of the Temple,"The research reminds one of Studs Terkel without the humor. Individual authors and news clipping are added together as though they have some ""scientific"" weight.There is no marco data; no attempt to make scientific comparisons. It is a primer on partisan politics that is based on Christain churchmen doing good deeds. How awful!I'm sure Marvin was good at bootstrap pulling, but where are the convincing data? Shotty work by an academic."
4,This book should be read by everyone.,"This is a great book to read, especially if you're interested in politics or the welfare system. Olasky is optimistic and provides a realistic and logical approach to the problems with welfare. He outlines the history of welfare and compassion in this country clearly, although the history gets a little bit tedious in the middle of the book. If you keep going, however, the last two chapters make the repetition worthwhile. Olasky's approach to the welfare problem is logical, and his conclusion is likewise. Instead of just recommending that people sit on their hands, Olasky gives practical suggestions for implementing true compassion in your own approach to those in need. I highly recommend this book."
3,Nice deep Pan,"Although this is a deep cast iron pan that will last a life time and beyond, I wish it was 10 1/4 wide at the bottom not at the top. The size at the bottom is more like 8 inches. I still like it and will use it forever."
5,Willie K. is the greatest,"Willie K. (aka: Uncle Willie, Willie Kahaialii)is the greatest Hawaiian musician of his generation.The guy has a 10-octave voice! When he decides to sing Italian arias, he out-sings Pavarotti....but I love his Hawaiian stuff the best.This is one of his best CD's, and has been shared with many friends."
1,Moldy,"I am sensitive to mold and the book was so old that it was moldy. I guess, what did I expect, it's out of print."
1,forgetaboutit,"I hate to be too harsh to Mark, after all he is a talented musician and songwriter, but this CD is just plain wrong. There are times listening to this record that I thought Yoko Ono's worst efforts were dubbed in. Save your money and hope that Mark Olson gets his act back together for future efforts."
4,Tacking chances,"This is all we expected it to be , after looking at the Television series, we have enjoyed both the book and the TV series"

One page at a time, I am getting there...only about a month with eBay selling and I, put up a store front, created my about me page, customized my settings for invoices and emails to customers, and made over $400 dollars in sales...not bad for a rookie just getting through the details.

3,Too Old To Be Really Useful,"This book, published in 2005, has some decent tips on attracting traffic to your items and how best to use graphics and fonts to create an online image four yourself. And there are some basic details about cross-selling and 'finding your niche' that are timeless.But most of what is useful has also appeared in more recent books, and eBay and online selling has changed so much in the years since this was published that I think you'd be better off just finding one of those newer books on eBay or online marketing.For more in-depth book reviews I've done, search for goldenrulecomics on the Squidoo website."
2,Captain Smith,"This movie was very informative, and it gave me a sense of factual knowledge because of the indepth interview with Eva Hart. I was very interested in what she had to say because she was actually on the Titanic. However, I had a difficult time understanding the host and several other spoke persons due to their accents. It was a little confusing, so I will not show all of it to my sixth graders because I think they will have a difficult time understanding the main points of the film."
2,if you like plain old pop punk this is for you,i was sadly dissapointed with this cd. i was hoping for a more dynamic cd. what i found is that all the songs pretty much sound the same. the first two songs are catchy but then it starts going downward. if i were you i would save my money and buy a better cd
3,A mixed bag,"This quite expensive Mahler cycle is a mixed bag, and it exposes mixed orchestras as well. Further, Abbado has recently improved many of the interpretations collected here, such as in the case of # 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 9 (cf. his recent DG live recordings, which are better than those in this set). And it is a mystery why DG included Abbado's weak Vienna take of the 2nd, which is inferior to his earlier Chicago recording, available in a DG twofer (that recording is also better than his Lucerne recording of the second). Nonetheless there are some gems in this set, # 5, 6, and 8 in particular. Especially the sixth symphony, with Chicago Symphony Orchestra, is outstanding. But, all things considered, this set cannot compete with other Mahler cycles, such as Kubelik's (DG), Bertini's (EMI) and Tennstedt's (EMI)."
4,Mahler 10 Symphonies Claudio Abbado,It is one of exellent album on Mahler Cycle.I really enjoy Symohony No. 5 by Cladio Abbado.There are many reasons to keep Mahler cycle.Recordings are excellent
1,Don't bother,"My bad rating isn't for the music , which rocks - it's for the piss poor mastering ! This sounds WORSE than my old CD's - if you buy this get it for the great music but DON'T buy to get a disc that sounds better than your old ones ."
4,Correction to the first review,"Adrian did not play the solo to Whitesnake's ""Is This Love"". That solo was played John Sykes. Adrian's only guitar work on the ""Whitesnake"" record is the solo on ""Here I Go Again"". John Sykes played all of the other guitar parts on that album."
5,An album that you just gotta hear!,"Francis Dunnery - Tall Blonde HelicopterTall Blonde Helicopter was the third album released by UK's Francis Dunnery who left his progressive rock roots behind (it bites) to pursue his solo career musical interests. For me it was in his post ""It Bites""-era that I became really interested in what he was doing and have snagged a number of his solo albms with this one rising to the top!Dunnery is a wonder songwriter and every song on this album is excellent with tons of great guitar work.Songs like ""in my dreams"", ""too much Saturn"" and ""48 hours"" how did this album not rise to the top and get a whole lot more interest i'll never know ! This album is just fantastic with Francis playing most of the instruments and even sharing a duet with Jill Sobule on ""rain or shine"".Francis is a fantastic guitarist, singer and songwriter.......just the total package........"
4,When I was young,"Beat Happening is one of the most musically inept rock bands of all time. The only band who supercedes them in talentlessness is Half Japanese who had little to no ability to write a melody. Beat Happening at least has melody-writing prowess. This is obviously one of those bands whose feeling is more impotant than their virtuosity and man do they have feeling. ""Youth"" is one of the most hauntingly real portrayls of the human conditon ever recorded in any art form. They sharpened their chops a bit on their later efforts but this one is extremely rudimentary. Its a great album based on its art alone; the musicality [is bad]. Calvin Johnson is one of the only human beings who legitamately scares me and for that I respect him."
1,Shaky Camera,I shall pass on this one. I saw a short clip on Bill O'Rielly and the camera was bouncing all over the place. This may be a lovely new technique for some but it makes me sick!
1,A DUMB POLITICAL MADE UP DOC,"How can anyone label this very dumb movie as ""Great"" or ""Accurate"" when they were not even there. This is another flic where Damon is using his celebrity status to pan America and Bush. When are you left wingers going to move on - especially you DAMON? I and many other vets have lost all respect for this Damon guy because he shows his contempt for this country to put a story like this on the screen because their are always people that will really believe it. Give it a rest. If this war was all about oil why aren't the gas prices down instead of going up? I and many more will never see another Damon movie again."
1,Won't play,I had hoped to enjoy this movie in the Blu-Ray format to unfortunately find that the disc won't go beyond the Universal icon at the beginning of the disc.
1,Not recommended,typical B action movie. I wouldn't even have bought it if my son wasn't an extra in it.
1,another political war movie,I can not even waste too many words on such an obvious left leaning war movie. It is a far cry from hurt locker.
5,Great Movie,"I loved the movie, but wish they had made it just a little longer to help the clarity of it. I also think the camera movement could have been slowed down just a hair. Damons acting was excellent and the action pace was great."
3,Made my head ache,"So much jumpy action, juggling camera work, dark almost invisible scenes. Man, this is hard to watch. You feel like you've had 10 cups of coffee after awhile. This is fully based in reality. Instead of the Ny Times Judith Miller as the Bush administration's press schill, they changed that to someone from the WSJ. I found that funny. There were no WMD in Iraq, but one American soldier is determined to find out why he went to war anyway. That's the gist here, as Matt Damon plays the heroic soldier looking for a plot to fabricate tales of WMD as a justification for a war to remove Saddam Hussein. This plays very anti-war, so I guess the right-wingers didn't like it. I didn't care for it much because the film techniques are so tiresome. What a confusing mess of chaos."
5,Excellent movie,"This movie is excellent. I have become bored with propaganda telling lies lies lies. This movie exposes he truth of a war we as Americans should have not fought based on lies. I read the reviews giving this movie 1 star and i have 1 thing to say (the truth hurts sometimes). Now in this country USA we find ourselves looking down the barrel of the same disease that started the gulf war Evil men with an Evil agenda are using lies to target American civilians as terrorist.NDAA 2012 says we will no longer have a right to a trial or lawyer if we are accused. The list of things they consider crimes is long and it includes Christians,Animal rights activist and others. So because we allowed all these crimes to take place and we did not resist evil liars now we are dealing with a corrupt criminal enterprise that has taken our freedoms away. Too bad some still confuse corruption for patriotism. The truth will always be told. God always has a witness."
2,Not Bourne,"Heard bad things about this movie, but took a chance because I love the Bourne series. This movie was definitely lacking and the political agenda got really annoying (even though I agreed with it). WMDs WMDs WMDs. Give it a rest."
1,RENT IT,"not worth buying, its basically about a ricky rescue who wants to save the day and make an impact on the war..needless to say lots of unrealistic events, and def not worth purchasing. i like the bourne movies eventho they be be pretty hollywood sometimes, but this just didnt even come close"
2,Just another anti-Bush/conservative film.,"I would like to see Matt Damon make an action movie that actually portrays our real enemies as our real enemies. Why does his action films (Bourne, etc) paint the CIA, FBI, Conservatives, and patriotic Americans as the enemies? The Iranians, North Koreans, Russian Rouges, Chinese Communists and other real enemies of America seem to be completely ignored in Damon's films. We, as Americans, are always the bad guys. Does anyone remember the news footage showing a caravan of more that 200 trucks leaving Iraq headed for Iran just before the US led invasion? I guess Matt Damon and Michael Moore believe those trucks contained flowers for Iranian people. A prominent democrat once inferred it was too bad Bush won the election because it robbed Al Gore of the opportunity to be the Commander In Chief of the Iraqui invansion forces. I wonder who would be the enemies of the WMD conspiracy if Gore had been elected."
2,Huge Disappointment,"I had read reviews (pro and con) re this films political bent before watching the film. I knew the film had an anti-WMD tint, but didn't think twice about it -- until I watched the film. It was way over the top (politically) to the point where it detracted from the movie. I felt like this movie was directed by Michael Moorer and produced by Keith Obermann. I'm sensitive when films place our troops as mindless drones and the white house as greedy criminals and present it in a way to make us think that is all factual. Also, I fell asleep in this film -- simply didn't keep my interest at all. I couldn't wait for it to end. Massive disappointment."
3,"grain,snow, flakes(whatever); someone seems to like it!?","One of the reasons I bought a Pioneer Plasma TV ,KRP-500A ,was that it produced the best blacks possible by any TV at that time(2010).This blu ray however made the tv's best feature useless as I could see grain,noise,snow or whatever you may care to call it in the dark scenes.And this movie has quite a number of dark scenes with lots of action.What's the point? It seems that grain is necessary or even desirable to some people and even the critics(Blu Ray.com) like it.Personally ,a movie has to be clear and sharp, night scenes natural.Otherwise I will have to ask the question; why blu ray?"
2,Blu-Ray quality is poor,"The blu-ray transfer was very poor and the way they filmed it was horrible. The plot is interesting, but the way it's filmed is annoying. No one in my house enjoyed it. Matt Daemon was good as usual as well as most of the other actors. I think this letdown falls on the director and editing."
4,"Great Action Thriller War Movie (Needless ""R"" rating)","This is a great action film. Exciting and fun to watch.Matt Damon seems much more into this character than in the Bourne series.The needless R rating probably narrowed the market for this film.The producers should have put more effort into removing the R rating.I give 4 stars simply to agree with many reviewers distracted by the jittery handheld camera shakes...I have never appreciated the impact of this camera technique popularized by NYPD Blue.Hope to see less of this kind of cinematography.But it is interesting to see mainstream hollywood take on some controversial themes....this movie is part of a whole genre of thought provoking films with the consistent involvement of greatly popular character actors like George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Greg Kinnear, Matt Damon, Leonardo Di Caprio."
1,100% Political Propaganda,"What a disappointment! I was really hoping for something better than this from Matt Damon and Paul Greengrass. Twenty minutes into the movie, it was clear what the real motive for the movie was to make a political statement."
2,Slow and predictable,"This is just the normal shoot 'em up movie. The plot is shallow, and the acting is only fair at best."
3,green zone,was ok not as good as I thought it would be. love Matt damon as an actor.The Bourne series were much better
2,More political than anything else,"I watched this movie at a friend's house and I fell asleep about halfway through it. I was eager to watch it because I enjoyed the Bourne films (despite the constant camera-shakiness of Supremacy and Ultimatum) but this movie just wasn't that captivating. I was only asleep for fifteen minutes or so and I woke up to see the ending and realized I could have stayed asleep. The very annoying shaky camera effects are back in play for this movie, and to me the plot for this movie wasn't all that interesting. The whole ""one soldier against the entire military/US government and the one soldier wins"" is absurd. I think the acting was about the only good highlight. There were some parts that were interesting, but overall it was just a lackluster movie."
2,Overblown attempt to discredit America,"Lots of action and pounding drums, but really there's nothing here other than a fictional propaganda to discredit America for going into Iraq and toppling Saddam. If you want a pat on the back for disliking America in Iraq, then yahoo and enjoy. Otherwise don't buy it. I'm not really a fan of Bourne stuff either."
3,Love Matt Damon BUT,I really like Matt Damon. He is by far my favorite action hero. In the Bourne Series.BUT I am getting so sick of movies about Toxic Chemical Warfare. This one moved so slow I could not finish it. So i ahve no idea how it ends.I will buy and watch anything Matt Makes. Like I said though I am not so much a fan of conspicy regarding chemical or germ warfare et al.I am also kind of tired of the Middle East and the movies about thier problems.
1,Politics on the big screen,"While hollywood has always had an influence on the countries fads and trends, in this case, they're out in left field in more ways than one. Sadly, this is all too often the case with recent movies."
1,Excellent Fiction.,"""Green Zone"" is truly an excellent fiction flick. Anybody who doesn't realize this Hollywood action movie is merely pumped up political fiction and takes it to heart...well I hear the ""Wizard of Oz"" movie still scares children into believing monkeys can fly. However Tornados do happen.I only gave this fun shoot'em up bang movie a one star is because of the political plot porn. 'Black Hawk Down' is more reliable as to being light years closer to any historical truth compared to ""Green Zone Acres.""Pssst by the way...the WMD were transported into Syria, one of Iraq's `friends,' just before the war. Watch out Israel."
1,Typical Hollywood Anti-War film with matching wooden acting.,"I sadly can't get back the time I wasted on this film. Matt Damon, one of the most over-rated actors, whose range is A to B, prances about pretending to be a warrior.The film is racked full of liberal cliches and had they worked into it, some ""proof"" that Bush had planted bombs in the WTC to justify the war, I wouldn't have been shocked.This film will please those people who don't mind politics dressed up as a movie and by those who are hoping the last couple of year's progress in Iraq somehow unravels.It will be popular in places like Iran, Turkey, and other nations where pork isn't on the menu.Deservingly, the film flopped. Don't waste your money on it."
3,It was just ehh,"My review for this item is to be taken from only one person's point of view and not as a whole. I really think this movie has a large political value. If it doesn't scream 'I hate Bush'. Nothing does. This movie is nothing more than a cheap way to make pop shots on behalf of the liberal media and liberal agenda. You may personally agree or disagree with the war in Iraq, but to make a movie about how the war was a lie and we are killing thousands of civilians everyday...I mean come on. Personally, I think the movie is pretty anti-american, anti-republican, and anti-Bush.Outside of the political movement...the movie was filled with action. Similar to Borne Identity. Good fight scenes, good action. It is enough to keep your eyes on the TV at least! But the movie isn't like anything you haven't seen before. So with that being said...I give it 3 stars or originality."
3,"Well, it's not Jason Bourne...",I was expecting a Bourne film which is MY OWN FAULT upon reading that this was made by the Bourne Ultimatum Director. It takes alot of twists and turns and you don't know who to like or who to trust! It has a good story but my major problem was with the filming! I think their approach was to make you feel as if you were there. I did not. I felt nausea and headache. All in all it's ok. The action sequences are good and it has some great Actors but this film just didn't do it for me for some reason. I would recommend watching it but can't recommend purchasing. Thanks for reading :)
4,Surprising modern war movie.,If you liked The Kingdom you will like this movie. Damon does a stellar job. Plenty of action and great story line.
3,it was ok!!!!!!!!!!!,"i was a little disappointed in the movie,i thought it was a little to political."
2,Motion Sickness Pills Required,"Bring your motion sickness pills. You've got the same dumb-ass jittery, gyrating camera techniques used in the Borne movies, numbers 2 & 3. Dumb! Dumb! Dumb!It's also a very overdone action film. Boring, and predictable."
3,DISAPPOINTING,"My husband and I LOVE Matt Damon movies, but this one was a disappointment and not at all the action packed thriller we expected."
2,CONFUSING AT TIMES,Confusing at times. I think the best character was the Iraqi driver and Matt Damon was pretty flat. I get the general idea of the movie and all but it needed to be edited more before release. MY GRADE: C minus to C.
2,Memories of Bush,Watching the movie made me realize why I disliked George Bush. Matt Damon is excellent andplays his role superbly. The movie is too dark to enjoy much and the memories of the Bush administration make things even worse.
3,"OK, BUT MISSING SOMETHING","This movie is ok, pretty good story, but that's about it. I would have been happier had the BluRay transfer been better. The Blu Ray quality is really bad in many spots, which at the price of $25 is a ripp off."
1,"Good acting, too bad it's fiction presented as fact.","What's next the real story of George Washington! I was in the military for 24 years and soldiers don't make policy. They follow orders. The movie was so silly. Maybe Mat Damon can find the truth about ozone, global warming and Al Gores women!"
1,Dramamine Anyone?,"What movie editor believes people enjoy film scenes [clips] that bounce around like this film does. If your prone to epileptic seizures and or easily get motion sickness, this film is not for you. Action movie I get, but could they not afford a tripod? I would gladly let them use mine.Uhhhgaag... uuuhaag!"
1,"Uggggghhhh...liberal, liberal, liberal ""I hate George Bush so let's make a movie about how there were no WMD's"" blah, blah, blah","Don't waste your time with this liberal propaganda movie...unless, of course, you are in deed a liberal! If that is the case, I would highly recommend you watching this film and then throwing yourself into on-coming traffic. I had a feeling this movie was going to have a slant to it before I watched it...turns out I was correct! For the film itself, I found it hard to believe that Matt Damon (Chief Miller) could totally blow off direct orders (throughout the whole movie) from his superiors without any repercussions whatsoever ...and then be offered a job by the CIA, despite his unruly behavior during combat missions...just a bunch of Hollywood-anti-capitalist-lib-tards still mad about the Iraq war."
1,If convolution were constipation...,"Just bought this through Amazon. It had Matt Damon and was made from his usual team of ""thrils and chills"" people. And, of course, we will always have people making political statements however incidiously they are presented, so...my copy of this exquisitely naive, and incredibly biased garbage was taken out of the Blu-ray player (and to those who are trying to turn our young people into govenment hating...no matter what persuasion...cretins...you're doing a great job) and put it up for sale from whence it came."
1,Killed It Halfway Through,"Reminded me of the Bourne movies, which I don't like. Gritty and realistic, but the fun or thrills, like the WMD, are nowhere to be found."
1,"Slow, never got off the ground.","Thought this was going to be a good movie, really was disappointed with this. The story never really got going, I kept waiting for the dime to drop, never did. Rent this only, do NOT buy it."
3,"Great Damon, Ok movie.",".....I really like Matt Damon......I really did NOT like him in this movie.Here's why.While the film gives us lots of fire fighting and explosions and helicopters flying about the film cannot escape from a script that is a little too unrealistic.Great acting from Damon and co.The direction was fine.Pacing, score, everything was good.It just wasn't a very interesting movie.I honestly found myself incredible bored.There are better films out there.Hurt Lock, while faulty on it's own was better than this.So was Brother's.It's worth a rental but don't expect anything better than the two films I already mentioned.Nor does it introduce any new concepts into the Iraq war or why we were there.I'll recommend a rental to war movie buffs but for anyone else...pass it."
4,An almost great movie,"This movie is hyped as ""Matt Damon at his best,"" and this is what is wrong with the movie. After enjoying Matt Damon in the Bourne series, where Damon is indeed at his best, this movie seems to be Damon lite. Although it is filled with many exciting moments, the actions pale in comparison to the Bourne series. A second problem is that I did not feel that the solution to the problem presented by the movie - can Damon show that Iraq does not have ""weapons of mass destruction"" - was resolved dramatically enough. I felt that the ending was weak, as if the writers could not think of a startling ending and simply has Damon send faxes."
2,So So,Matt Damon was excellent in the Bourne series. Must have spoiled me. This movie is below par in every category.
5,How far? All the way.,"Keeps you with it and presents a strong statement. Statement aside, holds its own. Whether you agree or not, you'll be with this one start to finish."
2,Could have done better...,"Story aside (which is bad), I'll only review the quality of the Blu-ray and sound. Considering 66% of the movie is night scenes that look like they were recorded on VHS, I place this Blu-ray up there with the picture quality of ""28 Days Later"". GRAINLY!!! Barely DVD acceptable. DTS 5.1 is weak, but this may be because of the visual chaos is hard to associate the sound to. I feel bad that Matt Damon was the star of this movie. As an actor, he's a perfect soldier. But the poor story line in addition to the poor cinematography is the death knell for this movie, no matter how good of the acting. Good luck next time."
4,great movie,I really enjoyed this movie and have watched it several times. Matt Damon is excellent and I am not normally his biggest fan.
2,Mildly entertaining,"Parts of the movie are OK but it just doe'snt really come together, your left feeling like who cares at the end. Not horrible but theres much better out there."
2,Matt Damon's riveting acting + Confusing style of hand-held camera filming + Historical fact of WMD,"First of all, I agree with this movie on one point. That is NO weapon of mass destruction found in Iraq. History has proved that's an un-deniable fact.Secondly, Matt Damon's acting is truly riveting. It's the only reason that kept me watching this film till the end.Thirdly, all other aspects of this picture are disappointing. For example, the hand-held camera style of filming made it very hard to see what's happening.Because of all the reasons above, I gave it 2 stars.Rottentomatoes website shows it made 33.1 millions at the US box office."
2,Used Disc Re-Packaged by Amazon,"The movie was good, but has anyone else received blu-ray discs from amazon that appear to be used, and re-packaged as new? The disc arrived in flimsy shrinkwrap without the bar code sticker at the top of the case."
4,Another Action Adventure :),I rented this moive for the airplane. It was a entertaining action adventure. Matt Damon is great in these kinds of roles.
4,Great photos of a cross section of churches,"Great photographs are herein presented of 100 Chicago-area churches. A must-see, must-have for any Chicagoan--for any Midwesterner, for that matter. The cross section includes the ""bold and beautiful"" as well as the ""plain and ordinary"" and the store-front church. The book is not limited to Christian churches, but features worship sites of other faiths as well."
5,Chicago Churches,"This is a brilliantly crafted, mature work from a remarkably young artist. The photographs are magnificently rendered to show not only the architectural beauty and diversity of Chicago's many churches, but also the neighborhoods they are a part of. This is a book to pour over again and again, a must-have whether you're religious or not!"
5,Can you handle the truth..,Ever cheated on your partner? Has your partner ever cheated on you? Have you ever felt that something wasn't quite right with your relationship? Do you feel trapped? Want to leave? Been dumped? Ever looked at your partner and thought hmmm - is this right? Do you maybe even think that domestic viloence is a part of your normal existence.. This is for you and me then. It's an amazing collection of songs from the ex Bawl / Fixed Stars boy. 12 excellent songs - not a bad one amongst them but be warned - you may feel uncomfortable at times when you recognise yourself and/or your life in certain songs. But it's honest - that's why it's called home truths. They hit home. Discover Pony Club - you'll be glad you joined.
5,Probably the best Sveshnikov book.,"This is an excellent book. The author says that he loves this opening and it shows. Special features of this book include a separate chapter at the back with 40 important annotated games (see Brodsky-Kramnik 1991 for a violent treat), comments in the introduction on strategies and piece placement, etc, and a two-page index of variations with assessments right there. The only minor problem I have is that the lines contain so many sublines and variants I can almost get lost. You can't play this opening with NCO alone. There are just too many savage alternatives for each side. Which brings me to my last point - are you considering taking up this opening but are not too sure about it? Then be warned, this is not the opening for those who believe in weak squares! You need to be an aggressive player who loves piece activity and despises draws."
3,A satisfying compilation,"Signs of Chaos: The Best of Testament is a seventeen-track compilation that was released in 1997. It covers Testament's first seven studio albums--The Legacy (1987), The New Order (1988), Practice What You Preach (1989), Souls of Black (1990), The Ritual (1992), Low (1994), and Demonic (1997). Two of these tracks--the previously unreleased ""Sails of Charon"" and ""Draw the Line""--are covers of songs by Scorpions and Aerosmith. In addition, this compilation is not in chronological order. ""Demonic Refusal,"" ""Practice What You Preach,"" and ""The Legacy"" are favorites. The hard-hitting ""Demonic Refusal"" sports magnetic vocals from Chuck Billy. ""Practice What You Preach"" is a memorable tune with an engaging refrain. And ""The Legacy"" is a well-crafted, gratifying composition. In regard to the CD booklet, it includes an informative essay but no song lyrics. The CD's runtime is just over seventy-six minutes. This is a recommendable compilation."
4,GOOD COMPILATION!!!!!,"TESTAMENT is one of the best THRASH METAL bands of all time, and this compilation is a nice way to hear some of the greatest hits from this great band!!!! I miss many amazing songs like THE PREACHER, DISCIPLES OF THE WATCH, SINS OF OMISSION and ENVY LIFE...but if you want the basic from a FANTASTIC THRASH METAL band, this is a good compilation.......but after this, you may like to buy ALL TESTAMENT albuns, because they all ARE GREAT!!!!!"
4,A Must-Have for Testament's fans,"If you are a Testament fan you would have heard most of the songs in this collection. This is a great compilation because all the songs are the best from Testament's albums throughout their music career. Over The wall, Electric Crown, The Ballad, Low are the best! However, the sound quality is pretty bad. The sound is a lot weaker than a normal CD. I have to pump up my volume when listen to this CD. I wonder if I got a defect CD from Amazon? Hope you won't get the same problem when buying this. Bang your head! Long Live Metal!"
4,As Advertised,Received the Perfume in a timely manner. The price was fair. I would definitely recommend them.
2,Do not buy this battery for your Dell Inspiron E1405.,"Reading reviews of this battery before I bought it, I was assured I had the correct replacement Battery. If this was the correct one, it sure did not last long enough. What a waste. Very dissapointed, and am reminded sometimes you have to spend the money to get what you want. Buying off brands to save a little money did not pay off this time!I'm sure the waranty is up, 8 months and the product is worthless!"
1,Inop,"Battery arrived swollen, with the casing strained, as though one of the cells inside had already exploded.It had some charge when plugged in, but was unable to be recharged. Sender took a couple weeks to get back to me, too long to be able to initiate return. Left holding bad battery."
1,Terrible!,"There is about as much information in this 'book' as is on a badly researched Katie Holmes website. It has all of the obvious information that you probably already know. It is a mere 32 pages of large font and about 6 black and white photos. I could have written more and published a better book than this! Rather get ""Katie Holmes Scene""."
3,A Difficult Textbook,"I thought that this book had difficult wording and was more a college-level book rather than a high school-level book. However, it covers a wide range of civilizations and concentrates on a fundamental theme to compare different times, places, and societies: the interaction of human beings and the environment. Emphasis is placed on technological development and how technology underlies all human activity. It also caught my interest because it included a unique phonetic guide to unfamiliar words."
5,finding your inner joy,i love this movie. such a talented cast. i love uptight characters that meet kookie characters. finding his inner joy and the box of moonlight...
5,One of my favorites,"One of my favorites, since buying it several years ago, I still like to watch it again and again.This is one of my favorite movies, when I want to watch a fun movie where I'll feel good about people without fairytale sappiness, this is what I grab from my stash of DVDs. Al and Kid are wonderful opposite types who remain themselves throughout the movie, yet add to each other through the friendship that they form. The feelings of camaraderie are portrayed well with a freshness that comes right through the screen and I end up taking life a little less seriously after watching it."
2,Running on empty,"'Box of Moonlight' feels like a short film painfully dragged out to four times its natural length as John Turturo's uptight clockwatching engineer finds himself facing a typical indie movie midlife crisis after a job ends unexpectedly early by going on the road in search of childhood memories and finding himself caught up in standard indie movie issue eccentric Sam Rockwell's free spirited lifestyle. It's supposed to be liberating, but Rockwell's Johnny Depp impression quickly outstays its welcome and you have to wonder about Tom DiCillo's notion of freedom (destroying other people's property, cheating on your wife, giving your unsupervised small child fireworks to play with). A few quirky moments aside, such as Catherine Keener's warped phone sex girl, it's not a road worth taking."
1,GOD AWFUL,"This is the reason independent movies get a bad name. It painfully ambles from art house cliche (the wacky free spirit, strained offbeat dialouge) to standard cliche (the pent up businessman, all Southerners see Jesus image in a decaying billboard) As if it werent bad enough to begin with, it runs a good twenty minutes longer than it needs to, as if the film maker had so much banal material he had to tack on just a little more. It offers the viewer no insight we havent all seen better executed before. Rent or buy Living in Oblivion, by the same director- It has its cliches, but it is about making fun of them instead of perpetuating them."
3,"blah, blah","Light hearted feel gooder from DiCillo. Some interesting moments, but mostly leaves viewer wanting more. Turturro is good as usual. Check out Keener as an insecure backwoods hick, far from her usual angst-ridden Manhattan hottie (but yummy all the same.) Her performance alone is worth a look."
5,"""I'm off the grid, man!""","I'm only writing this review because I noticed that no one else has bothered to praise this film in about five years. It is a wonderful film. No, it didn't win any important awards, didn't make a billion dollars at the box office, and didn't star any tabloid-worthy, of-the-moment celebrities. What it does have is a subtle yet compelling story of hope and self-discovery populated with full, rich characters that are the kind of people we all secretly pray will find their way into our lives, but so rarely do, and fill it with meaning in a sorry world that is otherwise devoid of honest feeling and emotion. With all the sham and drudgery in everyday life, isn't it worth a couple of hours of your time and a few bucks to get out of the grave you've dug for yourself and feel what it's like to live life rather than just tolerate it."
5,Offbeat Fun!,"This movie is a surprising delight.John Turturro is great as the uptight engineer who loosens up after meeting a quirky characterplayed expertly by Sam Rockwell.Catherine Keeler is wonderfull in this movie,too.I never knew where the movie was going but enjoyed the journey.You will too !"
4,"Cute, funny, and somehow a little addictive!","I've seen this little movie twice, and I'm still here buying it. Boo on you if you pick at it and can't close your eyes to its little imperfections! This really is a ""little box of moonlight"" that deserves more credit than it has gotten. The actors are great, the story is timeless, and ""the kid"" is Peter Pan reincarnated. Al Fountain is all of us, and we all need a break, don't we? This movie is not a ""blockbuster"" or ""action-packed"", but for some reason it does stick to your bones, and you don't go away hungry."
4,Ignore the review.,"The review at the top of this page is, at the very least, as stilted as it claims the film to be. Don't be fooled. This film will leave an indelible impression. I haven't seen it in 10 years, but think of it fondly."
5,****SAM ROCKWELL WAS PERFECT IN THIS ROLE*****,"ONE SINGLE GRAY HAIR FALLING SLOWLY ONTO AL'S BAREFOOT BEGINS THIS WONDERFUL TRIP INTO CHILDLIKE INNOCENCE THAT SEEMS TO HAVE ESCAPED THE STIFF ""AL FOUNTAIN""....THE TOUR-GUIDE OF THIS TRIP IS COURTESY OF 'KID' (ROCKWELL) WHO PLAYS THIS ROLE WITH MUCH BELIEVEABILITY AND JUST OF TOUCH OF MISCHEIVENESS. THE INTERRACTION BETWEEN TURTURRO AND ROCKWELL IS GREAT AND EVEN THOUGH TURTURRO HAS A BRIEF FLING WITH A FEMALE, I FEEL A GREATER LOVE PASSED BETWEEN AL AND THE KID, (EVEN THOUGH THEY WOULD NEVER ADMIT IT).***RENT OR BUY IT***"
4,This is great!,This game pushes the playstation to its limits with outstanding graphics and amazing cut-scenes that help develop the storylone. The soundtrack can be heard in dolby surround sound and each mission has a complete audio briefing and debriefing. This is a must have for any PSX owner who enjoys sci-fi or sim-style gameplay.
4,PS2 console no longer reads this disc,"CWV is the best cw game in its trilogy-sans the difficulty level!Unfortunately,my ps2 console no longer reads this game disc-which is'nt surprizing considering when it did load up-it sounded as if it was rippin my console assunder.Does anyone else have this problem?"
3,Good but if you can get the unedited version,Even though its edited its still has its share of laughs. but if all possible get the edited version because certain calls have lost their humor without the profanity.
1,Three out-dated pages.,"$2 for three pages of material that could be obtained easily and free from a web search seems excessive. I fault Amazon more than the author. If I had know that this ""book"" was only three pages long and that it was four years old, I wouldn't have bothered. Unfortunately, that kind of information is often not found on Amazon listings."
3,well.....,"""bootee"" is a hot track and the best is ""bang ta dis"". it's a very haunting sounding song and it's got one of the best beats ever. this guy doesn't deserved to get dissed. he owns source magazine and before xxl came out everyone was reading the source. you can't hate it; it would be like saying krs-one is lame. at least this guy isn't some lil flip or b.g. or memphis bleek or fat joe or whatever else.....man there are just so many wack rappers today. but as for benzino, i think he's becoming a good rapper. this album was hot though"
1,"He tries, he really does","It's kind of sad when you're from Boston (like myself) and never hear this guy get any air play in his own city. His flow is mild at best and his content (Drug Dealing, Murder, ect) has been done to death. But if thats what you're into, try Eazy E, Big L, or even LL Cool J. They do a better job at it and they always draw you into the story. But hey, its your money."
1,"Benzino is the Second Rakim, ain't he?!!!!","Oh My God!! Benzino is the most creative Hip-Hop artist ever! All other artists can't even dare of thinkin of competing with him!!! This album is a masterpiece, a classic, lyrics which make me faint with their deepness! He doesn't discriminate anyone, he is peace loving! Even doesn't diss any other rappers, especially Eminem! Since he is half white and half black he doesn't say anything against the white race especially and thinks that hip-hop is open to everyone even to white people!! BULLSH**!!!!!!!! Benzino go ---- yourself!!! and ur mag too!! u're makin hip-hop look stupid! if hip-hop was u....man this ain't music! this is a bunch of cliche lyrics put together to get some quick bucks by dissin someone who's talented not like u!! By the way i didn't buy the album i just borrowed it so i'm not dissappointed that i gave you some of my cash!!"
1,Skinny Beach,"This is one of the worst rap albums eva. I got this when it first came out and was sadly disappointed. This is garbage and the movie aint to far behind it. Don't buy this. It's low budget, has bad beats,the lyrics are bad, and have anybody ever heard of these rappers. We know now why they are unknown. Except for Biz Markie and Eightball & MJG"
3,It's ok,"I probably didn't read the description close enough, but it is really small. So if you are looking for something that is decent sized, this is not the product, but if you are looking for some small favor or something to add to the gift then this is perfect!"
1,Dangerous for children,This toy contains lead. It should absolutely never be used by children. I returned it for this reason.
3,Money making Scam,"29 minutes is all you will get. Its hardly the worlds leading country stars greatest hits is it?What are they thinking , Greatest Hits, more like lets stick an album out and make a quick buck.You can buy better collections.The only reason why I give it 3 stars instead of one is because she sings, ""I will Always love you"" Whittney did a good job, but Dolly owns it, just brilliant"
3,Dolly Partons Greatest Hits,"I have injoyed this tape for many years,but when I switched over to CD's I found that the CD was missing three of my favorite songs from the tape Applejack,me and little andy and heartbreak express i was dissapointed."
3,The Most Ridiculous Album Cover Ever!,"Dolly's Greatest Hits...A fairly obvious title I suppose, but whose idea was that ridiculous album cover? I can't decide whether to be offended or to die laughing. That may be a natural pose for Dolly, but it just doesn't look right. As for the music: It's a decent sampling of Dolly's early country pop fare but is rendered almost as ridiculous as the cd cover when you realize there are only 9 songs on this disc (for a most ungenerous total of 29 minutes)."
3,You people are crazy!,"I have listened to this tape as long as I've been alive. I grew up listening to Dolly's songs, because they have no foul language (something hard to find in today's music, thank you), and they made those long car trips at age 5 go by fast. Someone should give this cd credit, and that will be me. Dolly did a wonderful job with this album, and if you want one you can share with your kids, this is perfect. I am now 18 years old, and this is still one of my favorite cds ever, and ""Me and Little Andy"" and ""Applejack"" are some of my all-time favorite songs."
2,Inexcusable,"Dolly Parton's 1982 album GREATEST HITS is a poor excuse for a greatest hits album. What was RCA thinking? First we only have 9 tracks on here. On the cassette, there are 3 additional songs which do not show up on the CD, which makes no sense. ""Applejack"", ""Heartbreak Express"" and ""Me And Little Andy"" fail to make an appearance on the CD. Instead we have 9 songs, which don't even make up 30 minutes of music on this CD. There are some great songs though, like a new version of ""I Will Always Love You"", and classics like ""It's All Wrong But It's All Right"", ""Two Doors Down"", ""9 to 5"", ""Islands in the Stream"", ""But You Know I Love You"", ""Here You Come Again"", ""Old Flames (Cant Hold A Candle To You)"" and ""Do I Ever Cross Your Mind"". Nice songs, but overall disapointing considering her catalog, and the amount of music each CD can hold, this is not good. Save your money and buy another compilation which has all of these songs, and more."
1,Dolly playing it safe,"I must agree with the Amazon review. This is Dolly playing it safe, and Dolly is always best when she pushing the envelope a little and keeps in touch with her roots. Pass."
3,Need A New Remasterd Version,"The record company should re-release this version with a few additions. They should remaster this hit collection, and add a few other big hits from that time-period. The tracklist should go like this:9 To 5But You Know I Love YouHeartbreak ExpressOld Flames Can't Hold A CandleStarting Over AgainBaby I'm Burnin'Me And Little AndyApplejackHere You Come AgainHard Candy ChristmasTwo Doors DownIt's All Wrong, But It's All RightDo I Ever Cross Your MindYou're The Only OneHeartbreakerIslands In The StreamI Will Always Love YouThat's only 17 hits from that time. Only 5 more than the original 12 track album."
2,need more carefull in shiping,"I just received the box with three CD's, one of them has the case broken. but the quality of sound is very good"
4,Compassionate view by author,"I found this book provided a compassionate and insightful view about the lives of the Onassis family. Kiki, the author, was closely involved in the family's affairs and business matters, so her perception is close enough to dispell some of the gossip and rumors often associated with their tragedies. The descriptions of the Greek lifestyle and traditions are beautiful. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book while on vacation in the Greek isles portrayed by the author."
5,Before you read any book on Jackie read this FIRST!,"I have read numerous books on Jackie O and feel this INSIDERS view of Jackie speaks volumes. One learns about the close relationships she had with her sisters-in-law, the strained ones with Christina and Alexander, and the fullfilling relationship with Aristotle Onassis. The world wondered what she saw in Onassis and this book provides many answers. READ THIS BOOK FIRST before any other Onassis bashing novel so that both sides of Jackie's later years are explained."
3,Poor Christina!,"I read this book to learn more about Jackie, the most famous Onassis woman, and yet I came away feeling terrible for poor Christina. As Kiki says, this woman seemed to have never spend an entirely happy day. Callas, as well. Onassis may have been a terrific employer to Kiki, but he certainly left wreckage in his personal life."
2,"Interesting, but definitely sugar coated!","Kiki Feroudi must obviously still be in the employ of the Onassis empire. This book is such a blatant valentine. There really isn't any new dirt, just page upon page of praise for Aristotle Onassis and anyone close to him. A much more realistic book which is just now available on amazon.com is Oh, No...Jackie-O! by January Jones. This book gives us a totally different Onassis and one that is much more malicious and capable of committing the perfect crime of this century."
3,Nothing new. Too much author's self-importance!,"Although Kiki admired and grew to love her employers, I think she sugar coated many of her observations. She also made quite a few mistakes, so I wonder how much is true. The anecdotes she narrates are mostly known, she could have made up the whole thing. In all, a good account of a family who despite their wealth -or maybe on account of it- had many failures. But she does present them as human beings, with their good and bad qualities. Easy reading, but not much content."
2,Very good insight,"If Onassis wouldn't have had any money, nobody would have bothered to take a second look at that man. Having money brings power but not necessarily good manners and kindness. The man was rude, vulgar and arrogant beyond belief. He treated Maria Callas like a servant, wich is unforgivable, and Jackie went through the same treatment. As for Christina, the poor girl suffered all her life from the lack of love and affection from her father. I found the book very interesting, the author gave us a good insight of what was really going on in the Onassis saga. A very sad story indeed."
3,O.K. Book if you are interested in the Onassis Family,"I rate this book as pretty good. The author, Moutsatsos thinks that the Onassises can do no wrong. Aristotle Onassis was a hot headed, power hungry, controlling, egocentric, unfaithful philanderer, as detailed in the book. Moutsatsos chooses to ignore all of this and portray him as this wonderful person.The book seems choppy to me. It was like the author had a checklist of past recollections that she wanted to mention in her book and she just lists them out paragraph by paragraph with their details. The writing just doesn't flow well.It is obvious that most of the information in the book comes from Aristotle's sister, whom the author was very close to, not 100% eye witness account."
2,Disappointing,"This book was nothing like the other two. Where was the imagination, the magic, the fun? The book was preachy with a trite message. It was nothing like the first two. I did not find characters to care about. Worst of all it was boring! What a terrible dissapointment."
1,Don't bother,"I was extremely disappointed in this book. I only finished it because I started it and thought eventually it might get interesting. I expected to hear about how the city of Ember was built, but instead, all we know is Nickie's dad goes off to work on a ""secret project"", which turns out to be Ember, 50 years later. I appreciate it was written for a younger crowd, but after the other two, I expected so much more. This book would NOT inspire me to read the City of Ember or the People of Sparks, which were much more interesting books."
2,Not what I expected,"I was disappointed in this book. I loved City of Ember and even read it aloud to my 7th graders. People of Sparks was a great book showing what happened after they left Ember. This book didn't tell me anything. I wanted to know more about what led up to Ember, but it wasn't there. Yes it showed how the world was in battle and things weren't going well, but that's about it. I kept looking for hidden clues to people in the other stories, but there just wasn't anything there. I will make sure to make this clear to my students when they want to read this book. Read it for it's own merit, but not to link to the other two books. Even then - I don't think it's a very good book. It dragged while waited for something big to happen. It never did. Too bad too."
1,Almost no connection to the City of Ember,"The first book in the series, City of Ember, is brilliant. The second book, People of Sparks, is still interesting, although it does not live up to its full potential.The Prophet of Yonwood, a prequel to City of Ember, is completely dull. It takes so long to get to the point (the point being how Ember becomes Ember and exactly what has happened, etc.) that I rushed through all the pages to find that there are only 2 pages at the very end to connect the plot in Yonwood to Ember. It's so disappointing because I was earnestly hoping that all the details and mysteries that are just hinted in the City of Ember would be unraveled in Yonwood."
1,Not part of the Ember series,"The book itself was kinda of ok, but as part of the Ember series it was horrid. It only ties in on the last page. The entire story is preachy and anti-religious. I was excited to find out how the City of Ember was built, who was chosen to live in it, how they stocked it for two hundred years. The Prophet of Yonwood did not address any of these plot elements. This book is not a decent stand alone book. Instead, it was combined with the Ember series because it was the only way it would sell. Do not waste your time, skip this book and go on to book four of the series."
2,Not as good as the others,"I was a bit disappointed with this one of the series, even the way the book finishes up seems to be rushed. The tie in to the seriest doesn't come until the very end. The entire first 9/10ths of book could be misconstrued as any post-apocalyptic book."
1,to call this the thrid book of ember is a lie!!!!!!!,this book has nothing to do with the ember story line. it was a waste of my time and money
1,Don't Bother!!!,This book really made me mad. It had nothing to do with any of the other books. The only part that explained why this book was written is the end. How the Disaster (mentioned in the previous book) caused for a specially selected group of people to go into an underground city to wait for the right time to go back up into the world to populate the world again. This book had the most irrelevant characters... Ever!!! This book was practically already explained in the previous book. It feels like the author just threw in some boring characters and plot ideas just for the sake of making another book to explain how the world came to be how the Emberites found it. Just do everybody a favor and save your hard earned money to buy a better book.
2,VERY Disppointing Book - NOT about Ember,"SPOILER ALERTAs a children's book, this might be OK at best. However, calling this book a prequel to The City of Ember is a deceptive action. This book has the feel of a book that had already been written about one subject and then, after the success of The City of Ember, the author tacked on a FEW pages at the end saying that the heroine in her old age was going to go to Ember. There is none of the magic nor any substantial continuity to the story of The City of Ember. I suspect that trilogies sell better than three standalone books. I suspect that the author's motivation was to increase sales by calling this book part of a trilogy. The book was boring and a let down."
4,a prequel in the middle of a series - unexpected but worthy of reading.,"It is a good way to wrap it up as to what happened before ember and why everything was the way it was. i just love it, if your into the ember series its worth it - not only for that, but also as a book in general."
3,mat.skye,"good read good history of how the story got started, show how people can get the wrong message, show how to stand up for your self."
3,waste of time,i really wished that jeanne duprau could have written a better book than this. i thought that after city of ember and the people of sparks that this would be a good book and i spent my report card money on it. boy was i disapointed im 12 years old people i dont need to waste my time on this book it had nothing to do with the first 2 books and i really disliked it i gave it a 3 because im nice and i didnt even finish it and i dont think i will unless im bored.
2,Should not be part of the series!,"This book is not bad if it was written to be on it's own, however, I think it was a bad choice to pretend this was somehow related to the City of Ember series. It seemed more like the author had an idea for a completely different story but decided to link it to the Ember series just so people would bother reading it. The connection to the series is so weak it's laughable. I was very disappointed."
2,Should not be included in City of Ember series.,"After reading the first two City of Ember books, I was excited to read the prequel. I was anticipating the story of how the City of Ember was established, instead I found a completely unconnected story. Not only was this not a prequel to the other two books, but it actually seemed thrown together and even 'dumbed down' in its style.The only reason I kept reading this very disjointed story, was in the hopes that there would be some unveiling of information in relation to the other two books. Unfortunately, it comes in the form of a tacked-on paragraph on the last page of the book.There were so many possibilities for a wonderful prequel but, honestly, this is not worth the time it takes to read."
2,Prophet of Yonwood - Definitely not as good as her other books,"I read the City of Ember and the people of Sparks a while ago and I thought they were fairly good well written books. So I decided to read this one, the prophet pf Yonwood. It was definitely not as good as her other books. The whole time I was waiting for some sort of suspense or climax (neither of which happened at least in a way that put me on the edge of my seat). I liked the idea behind the story but it was only the last two pages that said anything that really interested me or set up for her other books. Overall I was disappointed that this book wasn't better."
1,I'm Not Even Going To Bother,"I""m not even going to bother reading a book with so many bad reviews and has no tie in to the adventures of Lina and Doon. I'm moving on straight to the Diamond of Darkhold because I have heard from over 100 people that this book should have been a stand alone and that it wouldn't even be good if it was!"
1,"Useless prequel, don't waste your money here","This prequel is not directly related to the City of Ember. I really tried to like it, but till the end it was just a big disappointment with no real revelation. Feel free to avoid this opus!"
3,Decent non-ember story,"It's an okay standalone story, with a slight bit (~1 paragraph at the end) tying it to the ember series."
1,"Boring, nothing to do with Ember","I deeply regret having bought this book. It has nothing to do with the original Ember novel, the thin connection is mentioned in the last five pages. The story is somewhere between absolutely boring and ludicrous. A albino bear being confused for a terrorist in the woods? A humming bracelet? Uh, not my liking at all."
1,Skip This One,"This indeed is a stand-alone book, telling a story of a girl's experience. The postscript chapter tells us that she was one of the founding inhabitants of the City of Ember when she grew up.So it was disappointing, as I had thought it was going to be a prequel to City of Ember, which it really wasn't (and which still could be written).Even alone, the story didn't have much of a plot, and what there was, was annoying. Some people of faith could even be offended by the strong theme of everyone in town blindly following one person's interpretation of the prophet's mutterings, causing people to put up strong social restrictions and to severely punish sinners if they broke the religious rules."
2,Not What I Was Expecting.,"So, i read the City of Ember a few years ago. It was amazing. I loved it. A year or two later, I read the People of Sparks. Not bad, but could have been better.This book is really not that good. It takes 200 pages to figure out what the book is about, and almost 300 before you figure out what this has to do with the other books. As a stand alone book, it would have been easy reading chick-lit. There is no real plot/ character development. It's basically about a girl who spends some time in a town trying to please god, and who adopts a dog. Not some fantastic story of people who live underground.I'm just disapointed. I was expecting so much more from the author of the City of Ember.P.S. If you want to read a good Science Fiction book that just came out- read Scott Westerfield's 'Specials'. It's part of a trilogy, and absolutely amazing."
2,Doesn't Seem to Fit in the Series,"I haven't finished the book yet, but I'm halfway through and have lost interest. It really doesn't seem to fit very well into the Ember series. I loved The City of Ember, was intrigued by The People of Sparks and really wanted to read the 3rd book but it has been a let-down."
2,A dud,"Well, I tried to get through this and my daughter did too but we both gave up about halfway through. We loved the first two books but this one has none of the characters from the previous books and it's just confusing and uninteresting. I assume it's meant to be a prequel to the others but I just can't get into it."
1,Prophet of Yonwood,"I hate this book. I wanted the apocylipse, i wanted world war watever the people in that book had gotten to. I wanted the Phalanx Nations to reign death and destruction upon the unsuspecting populous of Yonwood. Instaed, i got a crazy old lady, and even crazier old lady who should be arrested, and a whole town full of otherwise crazy people, acceptign a few people of course."
4,good book,An interesting interlude in the series. It wasn't what I was expecting but it was very enjoyable.
5,The great book,Prophet of yonwood was great. I loved all the exciting thing that were in it. I would love to read it over and over again.It was just how I expected it to be. I hope there is a 4th book.
1,So Sad,"This was a great disapointment after the first two books. The plot slogged at a slow pace. Perhaps I've missed something, but I found very little relation to Ember or Sparks. Oh yeah, one sentence in the last chapter. Wait for the paperback or go to the public library!"
2,Not relevent to series.,"I love this series. Just like the Harry Potter series, it's fun and I consider it ""brain candy"". For kids its a good series to get them into reading. As an adult, I have enjoyed it as a way to relax and chill after a long day of work. However, this installment in the series was a wast of 5$. The story wasn't good and only the last chapter had much to do with the series. Everything else was elusive. If you have time and money, go for it. Otherwise, pass this book and go straight to The Diamond of Darkhold."
2,Doesn't belong as part of the series,"The Prophet of Yonwood should not be considered part of the Ember series. It has some valid story lines that include the impact of blindly following orders, and it's relevant in this post 9/11 world. With that being said, this book has nothing to do with the Ember story line, except for the last chapter, which felt like it was a hasty addition and irrelevant to the remainder of the book. I can't imagine any child being enthralled with this book, or appreciating the deeper, more somber undertones that Duprau practically beats the reader over the head with. Overall, it was a disappointment and a completely unnecessary piece of theEmber saga."
2,Not related to other books in series....,"Prophet of Yonwood was disappointing because it didn't show any relation to the previous two books in the series, until the very end of the book. It wasn't interesting. Not a good plot. The second book in the series left me hanging, so I was so eager to read this one, but it didn't go anywhere. If anything, this book could have been the first in the series. I really like the first two and I can't wait to read The Diamond, but I don't recommend reading this one."
2,This is a prequill!!!,"I was not aware when I began this book, after reading the other two. It was a little bit of a let down for me."
1,Horrible!,"This book was horrible! The first two books were not particularly well written, but they were interesting enough. This book however, had no plot and was not related at all to the other three books in the series, minus a five minute blurb at the end. You don't learn anything new, other than the name of the woman that left the notebook behind in book 1.I highly recommend you skip this book - even if it is free - as it is a waste of time and not interesting at all. Skip right ahead to book 4, and I promise you won't have missed a single thing."
3,Yonwood,"Well, I really liked the end, but I felt like the rest of the plot really had nothing to do with the city of ember, besides the vision, too, I suppose. I wish more if what happened was explained.I also felt those three goals were pretty tacky, but yet they were the main parts of the story.I was expecting more, honestly."
3,Prophet of Yonwood... ok,"This book was good. I think it was more of a prologue to the Books of Ember, and it should've come earlier in the series. However, you learn more about Ember, and some questions from the first book are answered. However, Jeanne could've put bits and pieces from the end of this book into the beginning of the first book. This book wasn't needed, but it was still well written."
3,Groundwork Laid,This book filled in the back ground of how Ember came about. Some of the situations made the reader make too many quesses. It was an O.K. book.
3,Beats beats beats,"When i bought this cd, i was buyin it from the impression i got off the track he did with ""waste lanz"" on the cd ""next up"" On this track royal flush spit some insperatonal lyrics over a hot beat. Now on ghetto millionair there are still hot beats, but Royal Flush's lyrics are really wack. Im not sayin this cd is not worth checkin out, but it is not that good. If you are a dedicated hiphop fan, looking for sum underground artists here is a list of sum underground artists u should check out 1.Wast Lanz 2.JIG Mastas 3.Ranjahz 4.Boot Camp Clic 5.Deltron 3030 6.A plus 7. Young Bloodz 8. Grand Puba 9.Sadat x If u would like 2 discuss underground with me contact me at sosodeaf1@aol.com"
5,QUEENS,"CLASSIC, CLASSIC, CLASSIC.The perfect lp for driving on a rainy day.A Very underated MC but when you hear him you'll be a fan for sure."
5,And he's slept on?,"It's a shame when I see Royal Flush is another slept on artist that on this debut album would make anyone get down to. By that I mean, but just any hip hop fan from underground to mainstream that you should get this one.Ghetto Millionaire without a doubt is an awesome album and although it looks like he only released one album 'cause of Amazon, he's released one or two more I believe and still is in the game. But you'd have to look elsewhere than here for that.Get this album now!"
3,Lyrics & Beats,"This was a hot album. Royal Flush shoulda been able to make another album. The beats, rhymes, and story-lines were dope then, and now. I don't wanna wish bad on nobody, but I heard something happened to him a few years ago. I hope it aint true. Either way, I wish him Peace & Blessings!"
1,WRONG GAME,How can I review this game when I was sent the WRONG DAMN GAME?! How is it that I order The Sims 2 and instead get a damn Hardy Boys game for Nintendo DS? It doesn't make any sense at all!
1,WARNING not for kids!,"My wife bought this for my 1st grade daughter. I pointed out to the wife that it probably was not appropriate for her since it was rated T for Teen and had sexual content. I mentioned this on several occasions. Imagine my shock when I walked in and saw my daughter watching a naked couple frolicking in the sack. She tried to cover up the screen with her little hand and was embarrassed. I told her ""let's go get Mom"" and when we returned the man had left the room, but the woman was in bed rubbing her privates. Again, NOT APPROPRIATE FOR KIDS!!!"
5,great game,"Great game, can be quite an addiction though, so watch out! Got this so I could pay cheap since the 3rd sims came out."
4,FUN NOW,"The first time I got this game it would not work it kept sayin ""please enter original disk"". I call EA and the man pretty much gave me the run around. Then my husband brought me another one (guess he got tired of me hahaha). And the new one works great haven't had one problem and its been 1 full year."
3,"""Sim""ply the Best!","At a quarter of the cost of Sims 3 the Sims 2 Deluxe has loads of entertainment to offer! Explore town and meet a vampire! Take your next door neighbor out on a date. Personalize turn offs and ons to find the perfect match for your sims! With new build mode templates and buy mode furniture and decor create truly unique homes that fit your specific tastes! Even customize colors! This game is perfect for any Sims enthusiast of all ages! Also in comparison with Sims 3, the Sims 2 has higher quality music and sound files that are sure to be melodically pleasing to your ears! With new radio stations like techno and metal you are sure to find something to fit even eclectic sims' musical tastes."
5,"Classic game. Sims 3 bogs down in too much detail, Sims 1 has almost no subtelty. Sims 2 is Perfect!",Must have game for the house designer (those architecturally inclined or fashion inclined). Create and live out your relationship fantasies on your PC. Go live on-line if you'd like.
4,Love it!!!,i really love this product! my daughters loved to go download it and got to make vampires and things like that!i have no complaints.My daughter always would love to pretend to be a sim and we just love to have the interactions. my favorite part is when the sims raise their own child. i recommend this game very much.
3,Great game but not optimised,I'm partial : I love that game! Really! like no other game since Baldur Gate !But i definitively don't like the anti copy protection ( secureROM to name it ) that create many bug with other software under window !And this game is not really optimised ; When you have download or create some big houses or too many clothes each lot take a veryyyyy looooong time to load.
3,"Great Game, A lot of potential problems","First of all, when buying this game, make sure you are aware that it can only be played on a computer with a CD drive that can read DVD formatting. Second of all, DONT BUY THIS GAME USED. Many of these games are plagued by problems in the installation process. Took me half a day to get the game to actually be installed.Other than those two speed bumps, it is a great game."
2,Freezes,"It freezes up in the creating family part of the game, can't even play it through on automatic play... so disappointed.."
4,One of the best games,"This game describe the real live environment with fun stuff and a lot of free online add on object which you can download from ea (The sims) game website and also you can share your own stuff....etc, so enjoy the game."
1,Buy this game - if you're into crappy bugs and crashing,"Sims 2 is an awesome innovative game that brings together many great elements of gaming which thousands of reviews cover in detail. Unfortunately ALL of these cool features will end up being worthless for Joe Gamer, after he spends hours building a Sim family only to have it crash on him. Does EA even test these games before releasing them. Aside from the crashes - which let's face it are intollerable when it comes to gaming - the actual game play is buggy enough to be annoying. If you are into researching cheats online to fix errors, spending hours of time on projects only to lose the data, and overall frusteration, then this is the game for you. Nice try EA, but next time finish the project."
4,Vista users,"Enough has already been said about the Sims to fill a book. I have, however, heard from several people having trouble running the Sims. Either the game stops or the launcher shows that there are no expansions installed.Very annoying. The fix for me was to simply right click the shortcut and select ""Run as administrator"". I didn't even need to run it in compatibility mode. The only issue that remains is that in building mode, whenever I place something, everything disappears, momentarily, except the terrain and the floor tiles. But I'm about 90% sure that it's a video card issue.All in all building is a great stress reliever..."
5,Great Value,"This is one great value. It gives you two games for the price of one. The Sims is an addicting game that will consume hours of your time. But it is fun and always interesting what you can do with them. And you can also download content to add onto the game, extra careers, skins, items. Its amazing what you can do with this game. A game that will never get old and you will come back to at least once a month to play."
3,Ive been spoiled,"This game is fun, esp if u havent had the fun opportunity of playing it on an ipad. I used to love this game, a lil cuz broke it and i got it again after having played recently on the ipad. def 2 dif experiences, but its a fun game. I still like it."
4,Content,I have been playing this game for years on my cousins computer so I decided to get it for myself. I like it but I haven't had much time to play with midterms and now finals coming up. I would always recommend The Sims to anyone though!
2,Doesn't Float,"This vest I thought looked great when I got it in the mail, and when i tried it on, it actually did fit like a glove. Its small and superlight weight, so you don't really feel like your wearing it. All that changes when u get in the water. This thing is more of a floatation aid then one that actually keeps you afloat. Its fine if your not strapped into a wakeboard or waterskis, because then you can use an arm or leg to give a kick to keep your head up every 5 seconds. So if your using this NOT with a wakeboard or waterskis, your okay, but if you are, have fun trying to keep your head outta the water while waiting for the boat to get set or putting the skis on with your head under water. I really don't recommend this product."
5,Rock for ever,this is my first electric guitar and i luv it soo much!!! at first i was gonna get a Epiphone SG but naaa i got this 1 insteadRoCk N rOlL 4 EVER
5,We Are Iran is Awesome,"This book is a must-read for anyone who enjoys getting the in-depth story from the actual people who are living it, rather than the politicized, over-simplified version that you get from the mainstream media. If you've ever asked yourself, ""what is up with Iran?!"" this is the book for you. Ms. Alavi risks her life in publishing it, as do the bloggers. It's a testimony to the extraordinary value of free speech that we who have it must never forget to appreciate. This book contains excerpts from blogs written by Iranians. Ms. Alavi intersperses the blogs with historical, cultural, and statistical information about Iran (and Persia). It's fascinating, easy to read, eye-opening, encouraging, and very well-written. It's the kind of book that students in Iranian studies classes should be reading."
3,A selective view of Iran,"Any information on ordinary people of Iran is welcomed, but this book tends to be selective (only a small portion of Iranians have blogs) and this book has an agenda which should be openly acknowledged. It becomes polemical, and reflects the author's own opinions on the government of Iran. Anything positive that has happened in Iran since 1979 is in spite of the revolution and a ""paradox"", and all the bad things that have happened are because of it."
4,Almost as good as the movie!,"The book begins with Cole visiting a museum on a class field trip. As he wanders off with his best friend, Jason, they witness a plane crash. The crash victims, who have died, begin haunting Cole. They won't leave him alone until he helps them. As the book progesses, new characters are introduced.... a dead girl from the crash who befriends Cole, a detective who is trying to get Cole to help him figure out how the crash happened, and other various victims from the tragic crash. The book will keep you on the edge of your seat, just like the movie! And the ending has a great twist.... which you have to read to find out for yourself! I look forward to more books in this series!"
4,The start of something new...,"I, an adult, read this book (aimed at younger readers) in one night. I couldn't put it down. The book captured many highlights of the film, but it specifically left out Dr Malcolm Crowe. While he is mentioned in the story, Malcolm has accepted his fate and moved on. This story sets up a few new characters who would be nice additions to future books in the series (of which I'm certain will follow). A police officer who knew someone with the gifts and 'believes' was a nice touch. The book begins with his mom believing, but there are still struggles for the boy wonder. Although a shower scene reminded me of the unnecessary duplication of moments from the movie to the book, I was satisfied that the feel of this story matched the movie. I look foward to more books in this series."
3,Afraid to ask?,"This book is very reminiscent of the movie.In the book There's the usual ""STOP IT!WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?!"" (chpt.11) and there is some parts in which you are in for a stomach-turning rollercoaster excerpts.But we don't need to know how these ppl died;there's nothing but anti-climax ahead for us in S.S. Book 2."
5,The Sixth Sense.,"I liked this book because of the ghosts that Cole can see, and that it was a very good book to read. Some of the main charactors are Cole, Detective Brown, Cole's Mom, and Emily. The content of the book is that a girl Emily who survives a plane crash and can see gosts like Cole. Cole has the sixth sense and can see, hear, and talk to ghosts. This book is a mystery and you don't know what's coming next."
1,A WASTE OF TIME,"Few Times Do I Regret What I've Done In Life, Well I Regret The Purchase Of This CD/DVD. It Was The Most Unfunny Supposed ComedicPerformance, I HAVE EVER SEEN. Nothing But Rehashed Old Jokes ThatWere Maybe One Time Funny To Someone, BUT NOT HERE. I Like Gilbert, I Usually Enjoy His Comedy, Not This Time. Sorry Gilbert. Better Luck Next Time."
3,Not the best.. but not bad either,"I wasn't too sure what to expect from this album. I had heard Freddie B and Playdough on their PC album but I had yet to hear him go solo. I bought the Lonely Superstar album first and was expecting the same skill, and energy out of Freddie's solo album. I was sorely let down. The production get's really annoying sometimes because it's hard to make out what Freddie is saying. His rhymes on this album don't have any energy and lack anything that would make them really stand out. They're really plain. I mean don't get me wrong he's a dope MC but I don't feel he put forth all his effort and skill into this one. I was left with a feeling of ""That's it?"" at the end of this album. I feel he could've done better. I would check it out but I wouldn't say it's a must have for any one."
3,Razor Blade Smile,I Love this Movie! Its a class act Vampire Movie! When they made vampire movies with a bite!!!1
3,Leather clad Vampire assassin...ahhhh,"If you are a lover of indie flicks, and horror flicks to boot..this one is a winner. I have owned it for years, and is among my favorites. Shot on a shoe string budget this one is entertaining most times...and a little cheesey others...but still just what the hit man ordered!"
3,The Avengers As Vampires,"This film seems to have been inspired by the old British TV series ""The Avengers"". Lilith Silver looks like Emma Peel and most of the story would have made a good episode for that show. A lot of the British slang is quite amusing and the witticisms are typically British. The film does not take itself seriously enough to be an effective horror movie. It is more of a crime drama that uses its vampire theme for laughs."
2,Razor blade smile,"I have always been a vampire movie buff. I watched this movie and thought it had potential, but all in all, it had too much bad acting and too much going on, it would have been better to just concentrate on Lilith and her lover. The only redeeming factor of this movie were the costumes ""Lilith"" wore and the contrast of colors used, but that was it"
3,What is here?,"I am probably in the wrong section but I am trying to find people who have seen the unrated version of this film as well as the R rated version. When I saw the R version I felt as if something was missing in the continuity. Certain points seemed to jump forward, leaving me with a feeling that the director had a mood to construct that the censor did not want shown. All in all it was a very entertaining film but I wanted to see more and hopefully that will be fixed by seeing the unrated version. Any comments?"
1,Hit the fast forward button a lot,"This movie is something that is in the category of""wannabe."" It is made in a ""wannabe""Tarintino-esque fashion, supposedly totes HK-level of action (but even American TV has better fights scenes), and still plays with the weary old ""vampire eros"" vein that truly kills the genre of horror itself. ""Blade"" is a better movie to see for action and vampires, while new movies like ""Habit,"" ""The Addiciton,"" and ""Chronos"" truly bring the genre full circle to the root of vampirism: depravity. ""Razor Blade Smile"" has only one saving grace, which is the way it was shoot, but artsy photography does not make a movie. Hit the fast forward button to the ending credits on this one."
1,Problem with version of DVD,"Hi,I have ordered this DVD because I am a fan of this film but there is a problem with the DVD itself. It cannot be read on my DVD player with my TV or also cannot be read with my recent computer (2009) either.Thank you for your help,Eric S."
2,This movie is just terrible.,"I blindly ordered this DVD after reading a cool review of it that highly recommended this movie. I want my money and my life back. This movie is low, low budget. The acting is way over-dramatic, to point of being plain cheezy. The costumes are all leather and zippers to the extreme. The script itself is pretty bad. The characters have no depth and you never have reason to care about them. The photography tries to get artistic or something hip at points but it just doesn't help.I mean, I wanted to like this movie but there is not much good to say about it! How did this film get enough support to be released as a Special Edition? I'd have a hard time recommending this movie to even the hardest of vampire fans. Stick with Anne Rice."
2,If you like this Vampire movie then you know...all?,"Dear oh dear oh dear. This movie is hilarious. A female vampire as a modern-day assassin? Sweet as. Problem is she runs like a girl. How is she spoed to be able to kick all these guys...? Anyway her human lover is being hunted down by these guys called the ""illuminati"" which is all very mysterious. She's being hired to kill the ""illuminati"" one by one. Ok fine. Makes for an interesting vamp movie. But the biting looks pathetic. The martial arts are d-grade, and she sounds like a british stripper and wears clothes to match. The movie dribbles on and on going around in circles until it becomes clear at the end that the only way to kill a vampire is to cut their heads off.(""Highlander"" anyone?) It's trite, slow and takes it's humour far too seriously. If it was a college slasher movie then I might understand."
1,Warning,"Believe me, don't waste your money on this. Bad acting, no characters. The positive reviewers must have seen a different movie."
2,"Stylish yet, ultimately empty.","This film has a number of things going for it, including a terrific lead performance and some pretty flasy visuals. However, it ultimately comes up empty. That's too bad, because the film is actually quite engaging for most of its running time. I was left wanting more. Perhaps, that is a good thing. The director shows a great deal of promise. He is certainly one to watch in the future. That said, the film is not perfect. The action in, particular, falls flat. The fights/shoot-outs/sword fights just aren't believable at all. The artistic flourishes are stretched out into absurdity, calling attention to themselves rather than aiding the story. Razor Blade Smile is an OK film that deserves to be seen, if only for its good parts."
2,Razor Blade Frown,I love vampire movies. I even love bad cheesy ones. This is one of the rare exceptions. It's hard to say where Razor goes so wrong. It just does. Decent cast and look for a low budget film but the story fails to live up to its potential. This could have been so much better.
1,A bad joke...,"This film is neither funny, clever, well acted, well shot, thought-provoking... I could go on. It quite obviously has NO budget. It's supposed to be a kind of 'live-action' anime, but, as with all other live action anime, it really doesn't work. It's not worth seeing even to laugh at. Steer well clear."
1,Hot Garbage !!!,Hot Garbage = Worthless or nonsensical matter. rubbish Refuse; trash.Im forreal I want my money back!!!
5,Sexy Vamp with a gothic feel,"Forget the detractors on this B-flick. This is a Well made fun movie. Also lead Actress Eileen Daly is absolutely delicious as Lilith Silver. She can drain me anytime. The campy fun during this film can be found throughout. Lilith just loves the blood, and from what I read Eileen drank it like water during the shoot. A word of advice for parents, this is a very violent and sexual film, especially the unrated version. For those of you who are looking for another Blade, or Interview with the Vampire, don't bother, cause this is a B-movie in the true sense of the word. No big budget, in fact the 20,000 pound budget, Appx 35,000 US was far less than the touted Blair Witch Project. Best tip: Get a bunch of friends together in a living room, aquire a lot of salty popcorn, turn down the lights and watch. To think that the budget of this was less than the one day catering bill for Titanic!"
4,A vamp with sense of humor.,"I'll admit I'm not your typical vampire flick chick. I enjoy most of what I see on video because I might be a little too easy to please. But this movie had a twist that was most satisfying. I too get tired of the typical moaning and groaning vampires or those who dwell on nothing but the action side of vamp flicks. This movie displayed the action well enough, along with your regular love of beautifully sculpted dregs of the dead. But Lilith goes through it all with a sense of humor that belies the opressive atmosphere. It loves to poke fun at the usual stereotypical vamp flick. Something I feel sets it above the rest. I also like the low-budget side. It's almost as though it's thumbing it's nose at Hollywood. It's worth it in the end!"
3,Required for school,"I find this book difficult to read as time wise it jumps all over the place. Not only that, but the print is so small I am constantly having to pull out my magnifying glass to read areas, in particular the captions on the pictures."
3,"LOVE Linatone Plus... hate ""EntirelyPets"" Seller.","Linatone plus works awesomely with my GSD... he sheds when he actually has to, not just whenever, which is great.EntirelyPets was a WHOLE other story. Talking to them is like talking to a wall. I had issues with my order, and really only got $5 back from all the problems. Don't bother ever trying to email them or call them - calling will lead you to being on hold for 20-30 minutes (no joke, I timed it!), and emailing will lead to responses that have nothing to do with the severity of the issue you're emailing about to begin with. Unfortunately due to this experience, I'm going to have to look elsewhere for Linatone Plus, even if I pay extra."
1,It didn't work at all,I was really disappointed with this product. My dog is actually shedding more after I bought this. Do not recommend at all. I want to returne it.
4,Good for a shiny coat,"While waiting to decide to order the Linatone, I gave my dog cod-liver oil for a month, and the results were remarkable. One problem she had was a dull coat and heavy shedding all year long. With the cod-liver oil, her coat became very shiny (looked like it was oiled), and her shedding stopped entirely. When the Linatone arrived, I switched to that, and she has resumed her earlier heavy shedding. I ordered this Linatone, as I had used it with my previous dacshund, and had good results. It still works fine - she loves it, and it does make the coat shiny - just less than with the cod-liver oil. One note, however - she absolutely loves the Linatone, and was openly unhappy with the taste and aroma of the cod-liver oil (aren't we all?)."
1,"DON'T BUY THESE, ESPECIALLY FROM AMAZON","I purchased these shoes about 60 days ago. After verifying the fit and apparent quality, I put them away until closer in time to a trip I will soon be taking. I started wearing them about 2 weeks ago. I have worn them maybe 15 times. The sole on one is coming unglued from the body of the shoe. Amazon is of NO HELP WHATSOEVER in resolving my problem. They can not provide any way to contact the manufacturer. The mfr's web site does not have a way to contact them [COMING SOON it says]. Amazon offered a $30 credit toward the purchase of another pair?!?!?!?! Not hardly. Amazon has permanently lost my business."
3,Interesting topic!,"Big on all things Japanese, the author teaches in a Japanese University. I enjoyed his book. It is an intriguing topic. The puritan elders upheld that enlightenment and sexual activity are incompatible. However,Tantric Buddhism (Vajrayana) says that ruthless suppression of the natural propensity to seek union with a member of the opposite sex sours people, making them morbid, compulsive and neurotic. We should re-direct and transform our natural desires instead. Now the question is: are the teachings of the tantras to be taken literally or just imaginatively? In Tantric sex there is always a sense of detachment, an emphasis on transcending the physical form of one's partner, and focusing on his or her impersonal, universal aspects (see Sexual Secrets). Check out The Prayer Mat of the Flesh by Li Yu."
4,Good resource for my daughter.,This product is a good one for your high school kid. The trick of course is to motivate your kid! That's the kicker on self study vs SAT prep classes -- the classes drag your kid along.
4,Nice tutorial,"Great book. Many, many different scenarios to match all kinds of situations. Not much in the way of practicing but interesting"
4,I can hear clearly now,"Clear, concise and accurate communication in aviation is key for safety! This is a good guide for private and commercial pilots on radio telephony and phrasiology."
2,A bit dated,"A nice read but a bit dated. I am a private pilot and wanted to get some help on traveling through Class B airspace and there was basically nothing about this. To help a student with his cross country, it was good, but for more serious flying, it was lacking in details and examples. I was disappointed."
4,Great--but not for a total newbie,"Excellent book but it does require that the student pilot have some stick and radio time. Otherwise there will be information that simply doesn't make much sense.My one early beef with the book is that he doesn't talk about the essential mnemonic for radio communication with a tower: 1) Who are you calling? 2) Who are you? 3) Where are you? 4) What do you want? and, possibly, if you're taxiing, or inbound for landing 5) what ATIS information do you have?He does address these issues in a piecemeal fashion but I found the above memory device from my instructor extremely helpful."
5,Awesome student pilot aid,"As a student pilot, this book clearly and logically laid out the purpose, requirements, and a mind set for aviation communications for me, and as a result, I had a very smooth transition into controlled airspace. I'd recommend it to anyone going for their private."
4,An engaging account of America's foreign policy,"What an absolutely intriguing tale of America's foreign policy and chronology of events during the Bush Administration. The only thing I would change would be to add a timeline. The events may have happened in the past 10 years, but it is easy to get lost in history."
3,"Interesting format, a bit disjointed though","This reminds me of the ""high performance car, low performance driver"" thoughts I have as I watch some bad guy on those reality based TV shows wreck as they are chased by the police. Way too much dry, casual information, not enough human emotions in these pages, was my first thought upon finishing this book.A bit too much time is spent on Russia, not nearly enough time spent on things here at home. Left me thinking that maybe there wasn't too much energy focused on internal problems (US) and there was way too much energy spent on the rest of the world's problems.I read Bush's ""All the Best"" just prior to reading this book, and I highly recommend it over this book. I'm not even sure how useful this book will be to those of us who are historical buffs."
1,Whitewash,"This book would have taught me how disorganized and incohesive with the Bush foreign policy. I recall Bush as an elder statesman, perhaps weak on the domestic policy, but a genius on diplomacy. I am forced to either admit that I was wrong at the time, or that this book failed to grasp the brilliance of the Bush successes as they really happened. I am forced to conclude that Bush was a good president, but that he can't put together a book for beans. This book is boring, ill-structured and lacks the cohesiveness which was so ably demonstrated at the time. It's self serving without serving the president well. I don't buy the ego in this book. I'm proud to award it one star. No credit for effort."
4,GREAT BOARD...NO INTERNET,A great sounding board. The new technology Casio implements certainly makes for very real and warm sounds. The keyboard is intuitive and reasonably easy to use and learn.The problem is the alleged internet capability...it is NOT internet capable. The Casio Software downloads easy enough but do NOT try to download data or songs....Tech support is working with me but they have tried for a month to no avail. If they would design their software to work this keyboard would rate a 5.
1,How Do These Get Made??,"Seriously, does the ""director"" have a huge trust fund? ""Gee, I think I'll round up a few barely 20 year old studs and put them into an inexplicable, barely-there plot line that results in them being periodically knocked out, tied up, and stripped to their tighty-whiteys."" Yikes. Whoever is behind this series of art films - spend the money on therapy. Lots and lots of therapy."
1,Taylor Dayne - Naked Without You - Boxed Set,"This site is misleading, and contains inaccurate information. There were two CD's listed for this title, and both were listed as a boxed set which included one CD of original tunes, and the other CD contained dance re-mixes. I was not sure which one to order at the time, so I selected the boxed set that had 1 additional song. When I got the CD in the mail, it contained only 1 CD! There was no second CD, and it was not a boxed set! Now I get on the site, and only 1 CD is listed, and it specifies it is a box set! What gives? Anyone else have the same problem?"
2,Average at best,"Well, what a disapointment. I'm not sure what CD the other reviewers are listening to but its sure not the copy I have. If you purchase this CD you will be sadly disapointed. I was very excited to hear that Taylor had a new CD only to be shocked by the weak song writing and poor graphics. Find a new graphic designer to do the covers. Awful! Taylor should leave the writing up to others and stick to doing what she does best. Belt out powerful songs. Don't get me wrong all of the songs aren't bad. Just weak. I would have expected more from her. Her ""Can't fight fate"" CD was a masterpiece. Sad that she can't get it together anymore. My CD's in the resale pile. Only problem is no one wants it."
3,Mounting studs not long enough for 1993 Ford Taurus GL,"The 1993 Ford Taurus GL headlight assembly was well packed and arrived very quickly in good condition. Lenses were very clear and OEM design. The 9007 headlight bulb was included, but the turn-signal socket and bulb were not included. Fit was fairly good, but the mounting studs did not come through the mounting holes far enough to install the retaining clips. I thought about using the old mounting studs, but I was afraid of breaking something if I tried to take the new mounting studs off. I filed down the plastic bases of the mounting studs to get them come through the mounting holes far enough. This worked, but it took me about an hour. Aim adjustment is controlled by 4 mm hex studs, same as OEM. The Headlight assembly illuminates the road fairly well, but should spread the light more evenly. I will leave these new TYC headlight assemblies on my car, but I am much more satisfied with the Eagle Eye assemblies I installed on a 1996 Toyota Camry."
5,I love this I Ching,"I love it, and I am very picky about my I Chings. The different aspects of the text are presented in ways that are transformational and insightful on both conscious and subconscious levels. Very beautiful and complete, and the wisdom is present in an accurate and unadulterated way. It really matters which I Ching you get, and provided you're up for a little depth, you can't go wrong with this one."
5,Intuitive Source,"This book is actually my second. A friend wants to get started with the I Ching and I got it for her. In my reference library on the I Ching, I have six other books to understand my answers. Once I bought Stephen Karcher's book ""Total I Ching: Myths for Change"", it resonated with me and my issues and now the other books are rarely used. If you are searching to make sense of things, this book is for you."
1,Not for beginners,"This is a VERY in depth book on I Ching. As a beginner, I was lost. I am sure this is a very complete explaination of the topic but it was way over my head. So if you are a beginner, start with another book."
3,Review for Total I Ching: Myths for change,I received the book in 5 days. I would order from the seller again. Thanks
4,Outstanding Recording,"Recently saw Ann in person with the Cleveland Jazz Orchestra. Album is excellent, and seeing her performance in person was outstanding."
5,The mood of sophistication carried to its highest,There is not a selection included that is not fresh and exciting. I have the original LP also a remake of the original. Wanted to own the CD so it could be listened to on the PC system. The Beat and Tippin In are my personel favorites. This approach to rhythm and swing `is where Mancini belonged but he had to cater to more of the commercial stuff...Great music ...Great man
4,"Beware of of crappy ""remasters""","the music on this album is fantastic-after all it's from America's best composer!- but be extremely careful of buying so-called ""remastered"" copy from bmg/spain! it is truly crappy! sonics are rotten and whole album sounds like bootleg project; spend a few more bucks and get JVC version from Japan: That is spectacular!"
5,"Zildjian and Bill Stewart, you have given birth to a gem!","I just got this ride and it is amazing. It has such a wonderfully expansive sonic pallete. This is a very versatile ride, not in the sense that it can be used in many different styles though.This ride is versatile in itself. Elvin Jones could get twenty different sounds from just one ride cymbal. I shudder to think of the number of sounds he could get from this cymbal.This cymbal is dry, wet, raw and aggressive, yet sensitive and delicate all together. The stick definition is very dry but this cymbal has plenty of wash and spread. The crash is very similar to the nastiness of a china.If you are looking for a light cymbal that sounds like the beauty of a K Constantinople crossed with an A China Trash, get this cymbal. I have yet to get a chance to really lay into this cymbal on a gig, but I can't wait to.Get it!"
4,Paul's review,I liked this book. It was good because it had lots of detail. It is the third book in the Masquerade Cycle. It is based on the card game Magic: The Gathering&#61666;. You do not have to read the other books in the series to understand. All you have to know was some things about the game.The book is about a war between Keld and Jamuarra. It features characters from the cards. It is a very detailed book and is very violent.This book is by a different author than the other books in the series because the company uses different authors. You would like this book if you play the card game. You may not like this book if you do not like books that are long with small print.
1,Prophecy - A letdown of the Magic community.,"Every title in the series of Magic: The Gathering novels has been wonderful. This book is the main exception. This book is horribly written; instead of the exciting spellcasting and creature duels of the previous books, there is political debate and horrid plot changes.Mageta, The Lion (a hero of the cards) is written to be a machine wielding coward, and a beloved character is horribly murdered. The other legendary spellshapers make cameo apperances, put in only by demand of the Magic team. The author changes characters, warps the plot, and basically ruins the ideals of this set.If you want to buy this book to learn Magic's storyline, save your money. There's no storyline here whatsoever. The only possible reason to buy this book would be to complete your set of Magic novels, and if you buy for that reason, I urge you not to read it."
2,Yawn,"This book HAS been out for a few years, and, having gone back and re-read the Mercadian Masques cycle, i must say, after the first two GREAT books in this cycle, Prophecy is a bore.Jumping from Rath (Books 1 and 2) to Keld (Prophecy) was a bit of a headache.... a BORING headache... the storyline itself is FAR removed from the importance of the actual planned INVASION, and instead, for some reason, chooses to focus on a very boring SIDE story (not even a back story) to the Magic realm.I would only suggest this book if one was a RABID fan of the game, or just liked the Prophecy set of cards (and there were/are not many...)"
3,"Good on its own, but dissapoints when compared to the series","Ive read this series since the brothers war and i must say this is the ONE book that stands out as a dissapointment. I dont want to give anything away, but Prophecy really takes a turn away from the main story. At some times its refreshing but at others the plot seems pointless to the over all Phyrexian plot to take over! By itself, Prophecy its a great book, but overall it does little to advance the main plot, which led many of us to buy this book!"
2,DISAPPOINTING,"This review is actually from my 12 year old son, who has read about a dozen books in the Magic series, and is also an avid player of the game.This is his least favorite of all the Magic books he has read. He follows the story lines that come with the various Magic expansions, and has kept up with the material on the Wizards of the Coast website. This book does not follow the storyline, and actually contradicts it in some spots.He was most disappointed by the omission of what should have been crucial plot elements. There are no Avatars, no testing of Artifact War Machines by Latulla, and only a brief mention of the Keldon Winds, which is really what the Prophecy is supposed to be all about."
2,Why write this book,"This book comes at a crucial moment in the fight between the Weatherlight crew and Phyrexia. After the dramatic events in Mercadia, this book is an absolute flop.In the story, Moore takes us between the Keldon armies and their quest for reclaiming their heritage and Teferi and Barrin;s attempt to thwart them. This has nothing to do Urza and Yawgmoth. At all.While it may be a good breather and allows for the reader to see what was going on back on Dominaria, the book is not written interestingly enough to make this worthwhile.However, the next three books by Robert King are excellent, and you will be glad that you have familiarized yourself with Keld, Barrin, and all the event sin this book... despite how painful it may be."
1,Incredibly Bad,"In my opinion which everyone may not agree with, this is the worst book of all the magic the gathering books. It does not fit it very well if at all with the other two books of the cycle which by the way are very good books. Its protagonist leaves much to be desired and well the book was just a drag to read. Maybe if it was a stand alone, outside the Urza/Phyrexia like the anothologies MAYBE it would have been a good book, but it really really wasn't how it was placed in the series."
1,Not the best by far...,This book was very confusing if you havn't read any other magic the gathering books or collected the card game. i don't recommend this book to anyone. it was poorly writen and half the time i had to restart a chapter several times just to understand what was going on.
1,This book is just plain bad,"What can I say, this book is badly written.It had very little to do with the rest of theMagic the Gathering books and it is just a shamethat it exists."
2,The most disappointing of the cycle.,"A poor book overall which disregards events in both Mirage/Visions and the Prophecy expansion itself. Firstly, many of the questions this expansion raises - what happened to Sidar Jabari and the other Mirage leaders? Where is the Vintara forest and what is its relevance to the story? Where does Shauku come in? - were left unanswered and the unique Jamuuran flavour of Mirage is nowhere to be found - it's just a place where generic fantasy battles are taking place, with the aid of improbable constructions themselves bearing no relation to anything that went before, and with no backstory describing the emergence of the new nation from those in Mirage. The characterisation is minimal to nonexistant, with everyone being a warmonger regardless of whether they are nature mages, planeswalkers with a penchant for experimenting with time or lecturers at the Academy. Again, no reference is made to the past of any of these characters - Jolrael in particular is badly used."
5,Most Excellent.,This was my first journey into the realm of MAGIC -- what a great story! The mood and detailed descriptions transports you to the forbidding and alien lands and right into the ferocious battles. Most excellent reading. Can't wait for the next book by this author.
2,Not Very Good,"I got bored of this early on. Most of the other books in the Magic series I really liked, and the other two in this cycle (Mercedian Masques & Nemesis) were much better than this. However, I think the Invasion Cycle was the best of all of them.This was an OK book, but not very good. I wouldn't suggest getting this unless you want a complete collection of the Magic books."
5,Weir Cooking in the City by Joanne Weir,"I have 3 other cookbooks by Joanne Weir, but I'm still very attached to this one, as well as all the other books by her that I have . Her recipes are excellent, and utilize many interesting tastes, and fresh ingredients with interesting twists.This is a wonderful book, I've used it so much the pages are falling out, so I just ordered a new copy."
1,Shockingly Bad!,"Left me in shock for some time! Eric Burdon mutilated his songs so badly, he has forever ruined what was once some of my favorite music. Now when his old stuff comes on the radio, I flash back to this horrible concert. His voice is bad, his stage presence is bad, sound quality is bad -- I'm stunned that they would even release this. He should be embarassed."
5,A great way to unwind and remember Eric The Great again,"This video is for animal lovers who have beenpatiently waiting for Eric to return and hopefullynever fade away.Eric has never lost that wry look and self confi-dence about him and the way he has to sing the way he does if absolutely amazing at that age.Sit down and hook this video into the best soundsystem you can get, have a cool one and by thetime you get into 45 minutes of this music youllbe pumped up and toe tappen to all the musicians.Long live Eric and please bring back Chris and PatCouchois on the next album......."
4,Great concert from Eric,"This DVD really captures how Eric and band were at the time, and still is. Erics voice is stil going strong, and he's as energetic as ever.Old fans who haven't seen or heard of him in 30 years, might be disappointed because they haven't heard his work between the old, a bit boring Animals and this DVD. His version here of f.ex. Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood ain't all that weird. He's been playin' this reggea-like version since the mid 80's!The band is extremly good, but some of the spirit disappeared with Larry Wilkins in the grave, but Dean's doing a great job and so is all of the others, too!So if you know Eric well, or know how he is nowadays, BUY THIS DVD! But if you're an old, narrow-minded Animals fan who expect it to be just like the old days, forget it. But still it is a great DVD anyway"
2,Is Eric Bored?,"The video image is okay and the audio is decent, but Eric Burdon's performance is disappointing. Has Eric lost his voice or is he just totally bored with his old hits? I was disappointed in the stylistic changes made to standards like ""House of the Rising Sun"" ""Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood"" and ""San Franciscan Nights"". I didn't expect him to exactly duplicate the songs Burdon made famous with the old Animals, but I didn't expect him to take as much liberty as he did either.The one neat thing about the Eric Burdon video is that it is multi-angle on at least two songs. You select the view you want (there are three to choose from.) That's kind of cool."
1,The worst DVD concert video ever,"The Animals were one of my favorite bands in the 60's, so I had high expectations when I bought this disk. Boy, was I disappointed! A mediocre band behind a washed-up has-been singer. Burdon at one time had one of the great voices in rock, but sadly it's gone now. The melodies have become monotone, semi-shouted parodies of once-great tunes. If that weren't bad enough, the video is grainy and the sound quality is poor. Don't waste your money on this dog."
1,ERIC BURDON AND THE NEW ANIMALS,"I can't believe the other reviewers on this item!!!! I thought it was the worst concert I've seen (and I've seen a few!!!). I thought Eric way overdid his performance....too much ""jive""!! My wife got a c.d. of his recently that had updated versions of his old Animals classics..and it was great!!! I have no idea what happened here??? He seemed like a tired old alcholic trying to be (way too) cool!! What a dissapointment!!!!!!!"
3,Half right,"While the first half of the book is OK, the second half drags. There were lots of places in the second half where more detail would have helped, instead the narrative became choppy and incomplete."
2,not the best workout or dance video,"The most disappointing thing about this video, besides the pretty lame dance moves, is that it is from 1995 not 1999 as advertised. There is nothing worse than thinking you bought something somewhat up to date...and then finding yourself doing the ""skater"" to Naughty By Nature songs. However, I did sweat a little....but I would suggest buying a different video if you are looking for something with more recent music and moves."
2,This is a dance routine in disguise--not a workout,"When I bought this video I thought I was getting a hip exciting video.Well, it's moves and music are hip but overall it's very repetitive.It's more like a dance number than a workout.I found it somewhat boring doing the same thing over for an 1/2 hr. I doubt I will do this ""workout"" again and I wish I could return it.I did not feel like I got a good workout even though I did break a sweat. It does not target any problems areas of most women (hips and thighs).If you get bored easily, stick to the Cindy Crawford workout and suffer thru the boring music-you will get a better workout than this video. I wish someone would have told me this was a dance number rather than a workout or I wouldn't have purchased it."
3,Grind,"I brought this video a year or so after having brought the first Grind workout video. I do like some of the music in this video. The stretching in the begining and end is good. I like dance workouts, but in this one they show you a dance move and then break it down and then do it at tempo. It is repitative. I hardly break a sweat with this workout. My fingers got a good workout with having to keep rewinding."
1,HUH?,"The Stretching is waaay to long! Get to it Already! 2ndly The Dance moves are not properly gone over, so you're left LOST threw out the workout. By the time you take your pulse rate, mine was way below, since i was mostly wandering around my workout room in confusion. Eevenn Eric Niles can be seen confused and screwing up. 3rdly wheres the instructor from the first grind workout, and who's this crappy fitness instructor Wanna be with the bad hair that looks like she had soda cans in it all morning? STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE! Garbage"
2,Medium-Low rated fun,"Fun, if you are not much of a dancer or a work out buff an are looking for something to jump around to. The most annoying thing in this tape is Flava's grunts after almost every 8 counts. A couple of the men look good and show some style, but the girls look like they have no soul, or funk, just robots with smiles. I wasn't trememdously impressed with this ""exercise"" video."
2,"Fun, but not a great results-getting program","It isn't a very intense workout but it is different than other workouts. The music was great (even though it is old now), and the dance steps could of been a little better, but were fun anyway. One more comment, when are they going to get some real people to do workouts, I'm not fat in any way, but everyone on this video made me sick, and they are all stuck on themselves, get over it!"
3,a little cheesy but fun,"I had wanted to get this when it first came out back in the days of the Grind. Today this tape is a little outdated but still fun. Eric is a little cheesy (yo yo yo!) but I still think he's cute! Tina Landon is awesome, altho her hair is really scary in this video. The moves are not too advanced but still fun for more experienced dancers. The thing I didn't like about this video (which is a common problem in workout videos) is that a lot of times when you're trying to watch what they're doing, they cut to a shot of someone's face for way too long and you miss the moves. But overall it's a fun tape, it got me moving & burning calories, also there are some basic yoga stretches at the end if you are interested in yoga."
3,Container Broke,"the class container broke when I got the package, not sure whose fault this is, but it was quite disconcerting as the there were glass pieces everywhere. And I got spooked that there might be little pieces of sharp pieces of glass in the tablets.However, seeing that I already spent money on the product, I took my chances and took all the tablets. They seemed to do as advertised.I didn't get hurt (at least not noticeably). And finished the 250 tablet (a great value) without incident.I did feel like the number of pills needed to take per day was a little much though, but it appears that most other calcium supplement suffer from the same drawback."
4,In a mob family there's nobody free of guilty!,"The British films about gangsters, have their own profile. The last giant film I remember is from 1980, ""The long good Friday"" that somehow represented the British answer to ""The Godfather"".In this opportunity, we assist to the tragedy of a decadent and crumbling empire that is about to end, and how the wild instinct of preservation and survival simply ignores (like in most of cases happen) transforms this wealthy clan in a huge bloody swamp.Filmed according the rules of cinema verite, still accent the anguish and the inner demons that nestle beneath their souls.Good film but never a great one!"
3,Slow but engrossing UK Crime dark comedy,"Think Coen Brothers meets a KEN LOACH movie and you'll get the jist. Small budget but Great Acting finds this quirky British story of a Father & Son just out of a short stint in Jail. Someone close to them & their nefarious family business has ratted them out to the police. The family's downward spiral of paranoia adds to an ever increasing body count. Real Life Father & Son actors are fabulous. Mom is outstanding & a regular in several of Edgar Wright TV & Movie projects. Docked 1-Star 'cuz the tone's not even throughout the film. Instead of balancing the Comedy w/Drama...The 1st hour of film has more funny offbeat humor while the last 20 or 30 mins offer very little brevity. A couple of neat turns you dont see coming. Worth a rent if you like quirky, talky British Crime Comedy/Dramas. Definitely lighter but along the same lines as Sexy Beast, Bronson or 40 inch Chest."
1,Piece of Shite,"Horrible! Horrible! Horrible! I'D GIVE IT ZERO STARS IF I COULD! Don't let the cool cover graphics and description fool you. This Has to be the worst garbage all around I've seen in at least a year!! I gave it a full half hour of viewing before I couldn't take it anymore and turned it off. In the first half hour NOTHING happened. No tension, nothing really interesting, etc. I could tell the writer, director, actors, producer were trying to build up to something but what I don't know. Save your cash and run, don't walk, from this Dog!"
2,Hiking Montana's Bob Marshall Wilderness,"I was definitely disappointed in this book as I had expected to have it provide more information on the Continental Divide Trail in the Bob Marshall wilderness. The trail descriptions were difficult to follow without a detailed map in hand to keep track of where you were. For some reason Mr. Molvar was reluctant to identify the trails as being a part of the Continental Divide Trail. I never found any trail he described that I knew for a fact was on the CDT that he so identified. Consquently the book was not of a great deal of value to me, as I had hoped to use it to plan a CDT hike."
4,Valuable resource for Out-Of-State Backpackers,"I purchased this book as well as the author's book on Glacier NP. The Bob Marshall Wilderness was our backup if we couldn't get permitted to Glacier. Glacier was packed (even at the end of the season) so ""The Bob"" was where we headed. Without this book to guide us, we wouldn't have known where to go. The trail descriptions and pictures were very helpful and were consistent with what we experienced when hiked the trails the book described.There was one short-coming with this book was that I couldn't have found the trailhead based on the description in this book. If I were a Montana native relatively familiar with the area, I probably wouldn't have had problems. Just as a word of caution, if your circumstances match up with mine, I'd advise that you call ahead to the ranger's office in the area to make sure you get good directions. The book had phone numbers and addresses for each district ranger office, so we didn't have to search for those numbers."
2,Hard to follow,This book needs better locator maps for the trails. In order to map out a hike I was searching back and forth for the next trail section. It would be much easier to follow if each map had a locator map on the intro page to help you know where to look.
1,Cheesey;there has to be better footage out there someplace!,"The Ike and Tina Turner Review was an amazing ensemble, but this video does not do them justice. The choice of songs is weak, and some of the performances are lackluster (although this may not be the editors' fault). The editing is terrible, with shifts into the middle of songs and shifts out of songs before the singing is over. The psychedelic backgrounds are annoying. Worst of all, the camera pays too little attention to the amazing Ikettes as they go wild; instead, you get a lone arm flailing unaccountably into a shot that is focused solely on Tina.I love Ike and Tina and it pains me to see such slock circulating!"
3,an upgrade has been released,"there is a 2005 release called ike and tina turner live that has a purple box. that one has a better picture and sound! the stereo mix on that 2005 release is wonderful, even more than the 5.1."
4,"Great Performances, but ...","Their is nothing wrong with Ike, Tina and the Ikettes performances on this DVD. This is a high energy collection, but the special effects used are used just a bit too much to stay enjoyable. It would be great to see a whole Ike and Tina show on DVD or Laserdisc released with just their show and no effects used. The best songs are ""Acid Queen"" (no effects on this song) and ""Delilah's Power""."
4,Great ike & Tina DVD (no region CODE),Tina and Ike at their best ever! Wild performance at the German musicladen studio's. They rock ! (This is an NO region DVD)
5,Feelin' The Vibe,Don Cherry&John Coltrane have alot OF Chemistry on this Set.I'M Feeling The Structure&Tones all the way thru here.I Like Hearing Great musicians Vibing with each other.it's A Very Solid Disc.it's Worth A listen.
3,Not for Model Railroaders,"Orsi has written an extensive history of the SP that I found informative and interesting from the viewpoint of a historian. I was looking for help/insight in my planning of a model railroad centered around the Southern Pacific and quickly discovered I was looking in the wrong place.Fortunately one of my other hobbies is History, and Orsi came through for me in that respect. His research was quite extensive and his access to the SP records uncovered much that I had never read or heard about previously.What caused me to rate this book at 3 stars instead of 4 0r 5 was Orsi's tendency to repeat events in different chapters. I found myself frequently going back to an earlier chapter to verify I had read the information eariler.History buffs, particularlly those interested in California History will find this a good read. Model railroaders that are looking for specific information should probably look elsewhere."
1,What?,"Basically that is what I was asking myself through the entire book. What is going ON? I dunno, something abt a typhoon and these two gay guys on a ship I think ... Conrad needed a therapist. I think he was confused."
1,Huh? What was that about????????????,"I basically have no idea what the author was writing about throughout the whole entire story. Conrad confused me...obviously he was very confused when he wrote it, too! Also, if he was trying to convey a story about a couple of fruity people in Typhoon, it worked!!!"
2,Not recommended,"This headset is comfortable, but it had great trouble connecting to my bluetooth-enabled phone. It works well when connecting to its own base stand, but if you want to use this to connect to a different bluetooth device, I would not recommend it. It would refuse to connect often, and sometimes it would drop the connection to my Uniden ELX-500 handset. I replaced it with a Plantronics Voyager 510, and I've very happy."
4,Shoe rack,"This shoe rack works JUST fine. All I did to prevent it from falling apart is used zip ties where the sections connect to each other, this prevents them from sliding apart. I recommend this shoe rack, just buy some zip ties to help keep it together."
2,Breaks after a short time of use.,"I bought this item in January and it is now May. I never put the full amount of shoes on the rack and still the plastic bent under the weight. I came home one day to find all my shoes in a pile on the floor and the plastic bent so that the sections wouldn't stay together. I tried duct tape and still the thing would not stay up. It was great while it lasted, but clearly the plastic can't handle as much weight as advertised. I'm currently looking for my reciept so I can return it."
1,Really bad Shoe Rack,It fell apart as soon as I put shoes on it. A real waste of money. I wish I could rate it a zero-star.
1,Falls apart immediately,"Because of the way the three sections fit together, the shoe rack falls apart very quickly once you put shoes on it. Even with additional screws to mount it to the door, the sections slide apart from each other and we ended up with shoes crashing to the floor in the middle of the night twice. I took it back. This product is awful!"
1,waste of money,"I have bought two of these and they both broke. One was full of shoes and it snapped in half, the other one was not even full and it broke as well. I was excited about having all of my shoes off the floor, but they ended back there anyway. Also, i had to make sure my heels went on bottom shelves and flat on top shelves, or the flats would fall through the back. I hate I bought these."
2,"Holds shoes for a couple of months, then falls apart","I was really pleased with this shoe rack when I first received it because it does hold 36 pairs as advertised.But after just a couple of months, the rack is falling apart. I have now been woken up in the middle of the night twice to a loud crashing sound (terrifying in the dark, let me tell you). It was all of my shoes crashing to the floor.The plastic just won't support the weight of the shoes anymore. I don't have particularly heavy shoes (flip flops and sandals mostly); the rack just can't support the weight of 36 pairs of shoes for any extended period of time.It's a shame more sturdy materials weren't used in the making of this rack, because it would have been great otherwise."
3,FIVE stars for Joan...but not for the CD,"First, I must say this movie is a guilty pleasure... Anyway, after seeing the movie I was really taken with the song ""At Last"" at the very end. I was like who is that? And it was really nice to discover it's Joan Osborne. Her singing is magical. I'd say her cut ""At Last"" is by far the strongest track on this CD...probably even out of place next to the other mediocre songs. Paula Cole's ""me me me me"" song is annoying along with the bad Savage Garden song...but hearing Juliette Lewis sing was nice, she sounds pretty good...and the Lemonhead's cover of ""Mrs. Robinson"" is nice, too (why it's on this CD is a little odd to me...but whatever!). All in all, it's quite a mix...but like the other reviewer, it's a must have just for Joan Osborne's ""At Last."""
4,Savage Garden,The Animal Song is goin' to the top!!! I can't wait for the CD!!! Savage Garden RULES!!!
1,Very misleading title,"This video is extremely misleading -- it says ""120-minute Casper Carnival"" -- but there was only one very old Casper cartoon at the beginning (so old it was almost sepia-toned colors), and then everything else was assorted older cartoons. Some were interesting, like Betty Boop and Felix the Cat -- some we didn't even recognize. We were very disappointed -- we had hoped from the title that this would be all Casper cartoons. Customers need to be aware that this video is not what it sounds like!"
2,"A brand new chapter, yet maybe a different book","A panic fan for nearly a decade now, I realize that the show can't go on forever like we always hoped it would. With the changing of the band over the last year, the sound has changed as well as the bands creative direction. For the boys to put out a new album without road testing it at all is not only unprecedented it might be a bit hasty. The sound of the new album sounds rushed and undeveloped. However, if I am wrong, than the stable of fans presently dedicated will dwindle as the new song selection is vastly different. With minor exceptions this album is so lopsided it doesn't sound like the panic of moontimes, it sounds like the panic of the era; In that it seems to transcribe a transitional era and not necessarily a new era. We all miss Mikey, but George has shown moments of strength which don't sem encapsulated in this album. Though at least we don't have Randall on the new album. Enjoy this year as it may be the last for a while."
3,Not bad at all,"I'll admit it. I was skeptic. Finally got around to listening to this 4 days before the boys L.A. run. Nice album, and they worked it up really well Live."
3,"Well, a new road sure is true but....","I first saw Widespread Panic performing in a concert on tv one night, and I immediately fell in love with them. But when I went out to buy one of their new cds, I sure was surprised. I popped the cd in and could've sworn I bought the wrong band. It sounded nothing like what I heard on tv. I haven't even listened to it all, and I've had it for months. It sounded like some country guitars and singers mixed in with some latin percussionists or something. I was totally disappointed and have lost all interest in the group unfortunately. I heard somewhere that they had a new lead singer in this album, so maybe thats why is seemed so different to me, but even then, the emotional scar I received after hearing the first few tracks of it has smothered all interest that I once had in them. Maybe 4 decent tracks on the whole album."
5,Panic Keeps It Even Without Mike,"I just picked up this CD a few hours ago, and have to say that it's really good! I was honestly expecting this to be not that great, given that Houser's gone. But it's good--I could see a lot of these songs getting radio play, even. But don't get the impression that it's overproduced--it still has the trademark Panic sound. I especially like ""Sparks Fly"" and the folkish ""Longer Look""."
4,The guys are getting along considering their loss,"This is the first release without Mikey and he was one of their best and strongest writers. I don't think George played a role in the writing of this cd too much. I was actually surprised to find a handful of really really good tunes on this disc. Mikey's song at the end of the cd is awesome, but very sad. I think the guys did pretty good for their first release without mikey. Thanks!"
5,WP ROCKS!,"Ball is a wonderful addition to any WP music collection. I, personally, own every single one of WP's CD's and have seen them live many times. Listen to this CD with an open mind and feel the groove. They just keep getting better. Of course it sounds a little different than what we're all used to, but a little different is a good thing. As with all WP, it's best listened to from beginning to end in one listening session (whether you're at work, in the car, whatever). Give it a go at least 4 or 5 times and you're bound to be hooked. I can't wait to catch them live over the summer so I can hear the cuts from this album up close and personal."
1,"Horrible book, don't waste your money on this one","I just wanted to say that this book was the most awful book I have ever read. It was unrealistic, and the plot was ridiculous. This book is not worth even reviewing so I am not going to sit here and waste my time writing a lengthy review on this pathetic novel."
2,Should have read a comic book instead.,"Although I was initially intrigued by the Electra concept and a search for identity, I was disappointed by the lack of depth and realism in this book. After laying a groundwork of excellent prose, an interesting heroine, and some sharp humor, I found the much of the body and ending of this book to be simply ridiculous. Maybe I missed something, but I couldn't believe how this book ended. The main character (Debbi/Devi) doesn't seem to have completed her journey to find her identity. There wasn't any reasonable resolution, just a crazy plot. I would have been more satisfied reading a comic book."
3,"that was a cool book,ms. mukherjee!","i think my title to this review says it all! leave it to me was the hippest thing i ever read...all that free-flowing wit,the sex,the violence,the too-clever-by-half heroine,knowing just when to stop pushing a certain strand of karma too far and start reinventing herself...it was a phantasmagoric trip wasn't it?the poignancy of knowing that the pitcher was broken(jasmine) and that lil clear-water-iris-daughter had to go lookin' for mama was unbelievable. i just finished reading ""jasmine"" today and i'm blown!"
1,Whatever...,"This book was a big enough waste of money that I would like to warn other people not to buy it. There is no need to read this story because you have heard or seen the violence, quirky associations and conversation, zany characters, strange plot twists before. Chances are very good that you've heard or seen it done much better.This story is so ridiculous that I can't imagine anyone who reads this will walk away feeling more informed about the psychological nuances of adoptees. People do not inherit any traits from their ""bio-parents"" at the age of 19 - this was just irritatingly simpleminded."
1,don't waste your money. This is a horrible book,I don't want to waste my time reviewing this god-awful insult to adoptees everywhere. This book isn't worth the effort. This has got to be one of the worst books I have ever read in my life. This book is highly unrealistic. debbi/devi is a revolting character. What made Bharati Mukherjee write such a novel?
4,BHARATI DID IT AGAIN-- LOVE EVERY PAGE,"for all those people who hated the book- good for you! I love this book. It does not read like an american novel. It is full of fire, lighting, heat, water and blood. If you want to have serious reading this book is not for you (read Thomas Hardy or GREEK Classics) but if you want to have an enjoyable trip--I MEAN ENJOYABLE TRIP, BUY THIS BOOK. I read it 3 times in one year. I took it on a cruise and still could not put it down. Call me naive! - but I really enjoyed this book. Bharati may not sell many books compared to other American writers but this books sizzles like a heap of HOT RED CHILI PEPPERS in a heated pan ready to explode. YOU GO BHARATI!"
2,Waste of Time,"Bought it cheap from a bargain book table, read it fast and regretted almost every minute. If you like language for its own sake, you might like this novel because there are some awfully pretty and interesting turns of phrase. But if you actually read because you like reading an interesting, well-told story about characters that at some level seem human, skip this book. It's worse than a violent pulp novel, because at least those types of books make you work to reach the end of your bad story. Reading this felt like hard labor, and I'm not even sure how it ended after reading the ending twice."
3,Beautiful Prose In Scene After Pointless Scene,"That probably isn't fair. I'm sure Mukherjee did indeed have a point to her novel. I consider her one of the greatest writers alive today, but, after the novel smacked me in the face, it kept sailing right on over my head. Something to do with genes, karma, gods of destruction and indirectly murderous young women who flank directly murderous men? unfortunately, motives which might have clued me in to meaning were missing from the story. It all began beautifully, but seemed to mutate into a pulp horror novel for hipsters. I was disappointed, yet occasionally enlightened and generally entertained."
2,Road to Madness,"Sometimes I think people write to exorcise personal demons. This is one of those times, and I was not sorry when, like at the end of an overblown grand opera, all the main characters died. Catharsis. Baas. The end.The main character is an adopted girl who has had a safe and secure Italian-American childhood in Schenectady, NY but goes in search of her birth parents. In California, she discovers that they are both dangerous and totally whacko, and that she, herself, is more a product of nature than nurture.This has a better story line than any in Mukherjee's short story collection entitled ""Darkness,"" but it is equally wierd. ""Leave it to Me"" and ""Darkness"" are similarly creepy books and not up to Mukherjee's usual brilliant standards.Kim BurdickStanton, Delaware"
2,Disappointed,"Feels very comfortable when I first put it on, but after wearing it for an hour or so my ankle starts to swell, becomes painful and I have to take it off. I'm recovering from an ankle sprain and wanted the security of support on that ankle. Very disappointed."
5,i love this c.d all my friends have it go get it...........,i think busta rhymes and janet jackson did a great job on there newest c.d. they should get back together sometime and make another one.
5,BEYOND BOMB!!! MUST be played at all clubs!!,"This song is way too bomb! I start dancin wherever I am when I hear it. Busta Rhymes is the ""ULTIMATE"" Black Man. He is way too sexy. Janet's vocals help keep it poppin. She was entirely lucky to do a track with ""THE MAN""!! Much props girlfriend. People should at least tape this song from the radio. Everyone in the world should own this single!"
5,"Songs like this don't come along very often. ""masterpiece""","Everything from the drums to the lyrics were superb. If I could I would give this 10 stars. Busta Ryhmes' pure, ruff, ruggedness with Janet Jackson's sensuality made a combination that only Hype Williams could portray in a video. Whoever produced this track should be given an immediate raise, because the track alone is pure bliss in itself. Janet, Janet, Janet........you cannot go wrong with that woman. Busta, congrats., to a man who gets to touch on a woman like that. The video, the track, the lyrics(words from a god might I ad), the people (Busta and Janet): MUCH LOVE!!!!!!!~~~~~""........gonna make, gonna make, your body scream out yeah........."""
5,GREAT SCREEN !!!!!,The Monitor came in great condition and my Mother loves it. She can see things on so much easier now and the price was fantastic !!!!! Thanks for sending it so quick.
5,GREAT UNIT,"COLOR IS GREAT, THE PRICE IS GREAT, AND IT IS PLUG AND PLAY.I NOTICED THE REVIEWS COMPLAINED ABOUT THE ""SPEAKERS"" I HAVE NOT EVEN TRIED THEM, JUST BY PASSED THEM AND USED OTHER BIGGER SPEAKERS.THIS A GREAT 20 INCH MONITOR. AND IT HAS A 3 YEAR WARANTEE. HOPE THIS HELPS :)"
5,Great Inexpensive Monitor,"I purchased this monitor below $200 and it was worth the price. The thin bezel and profile make it a good fit for most workspaces. I've actually bought 2 of these and both have performed well so far.This isn't an expensive monitor, meaning you're not getting adjustable height and other features you will get from a pricier model. If you want a good basic monitor and you'd rather have a 20"" instead of a 17"" for the price, then this one will work fine!"
1,Horrible!,"When my Sony LCD monitor died, I had to replace it. This Acer looked great in the store. But it was too loud in there to hear that the built-in speakers are terrible (tinny and not nearly loud enough) and the whole unit emits a nasty buzzing noise that is driving me crazy (I'm not sure if it's due to this Acer's built-in speakers or what... but the Sony was almost completely silent in comparison).I will be returning this and getting something else."
2,Not as described,"I don't do many reviews, but the kit came just in time for us to create our derby cars. To my surprise, the wooden blocks were not rectangular blocks as shown in the picture, but rather triangles (they were cut in half). All of our cars had to be triangle shape because of the kit.Other than that, it was of decent quality which is why I gave it 2 stars."
5,Cheaper derby car kits,"These cars are just the same as the ones you get at your local Boy Scout office. But cost less. If you are short on funds for your pack, I would get these car kits."
2,Something so simple goes so wrong.,"Whoa! A block of wood, pair of wheels, and some nails. I could not believe how complicated these all got. I made six cars and each one had a problem, some the same. Nails for axles; these are crimped and do not go thru the wheel hub very well. The nails then go in the groove provided to keep the axle straight; not so, the nails tend to angle up whether pushing (hard to do) or using a hammer. Play with the wheel/axle too much and the would starts chipping. I had to super glue the wheel hubs on 4 different wheels, the plastic was low quality. Most of the cars had to go to the shop for repairs and not a one actually ran straight. This is not recommended if you are looking for something simple and easy."
4,The textbook of assertive living,"Although somewhat dated to those in the field, Your Perfect Right is great, user-friendly beginners info on how to claim your rights as an effective, assertive individual. I have recommended it to clients many times. I would follow it up with ""Where To Draw The Line"" by Anne Katherine and/or any of the Harriet Lerner books."
2,Better Twist Toys on the Market,"My son loves to play with similar products like TanglesTangle Therapy by Tanglebut this item really didn't have same range of movement and in-turn less ""play value"" for him."
4,A good basic Science of Mind text,"Bailes was an early Church of Religious Science minister. This book is a well-written explanation of Science of Mind ideas, less a ""tome"" than Ernest Holmes ""Science of Mind"", which was the foundation work for lectures and meetings from which the church more or less evolved. Although Science of Mind writers tend more to argue for their ideas than to really ""evangelize a faith"", this work has the slightest flavor of an evangelical work. The reader should not worry that it is off-putting, however. It is readable and its ideas are easy to access. If you wish to understand new thought ideas and an argument for their practical application, this is a good place to start. You may not be a convert (I am not), but you can find a good bit to understand what these Californians were doing, and how it links up with the entire new thought movement."
5,Basic Principles of Science of the Mind,"My book arrived in excellent condition, on time, and the price was reasonable. I wouldn't hesitate to order in the future."
1,Elevator Pipes,"Having received the CD ""Dance of the Celts"" as a gift recently,and having enjoyed it immensely, I decided to hear more of Declan Masterson (Leis Lacha,An Ghaoth, et al). I have tried listening twice to the CD, ""Drifting through the Hazel Woods"". I not only wasted my moneyon this CD, but have classed every title on the CD as bland, needing personality, and not even good background music. I rated this CD 1 star only because 'ZERO"" was not an allowed choice. That will be the last time I choose a CD because of a single title heard elsewhere. I chose the CD using a PC without speakers, so I didn't preview it. At least I have a new target for the next time I go 'Pinging'(That's 'target shooting')."
3,ABBA number ones,"This product is great, but Ineeded to have it reformated to the Australian Regentcey number which cost me more money."
3,"Nice Alternative to MP3 Players, Horrible Software","I have had this product for a few days now, and after playing with it in every possible way, I can say a few things. First, the software is horrible. It tends to lock up if you are running other applications. I have tried the application on my normal run of the mill home pc, and my power house pc at work. Either one, the software [is not good]. When it doesn't lock up, the software is very functional. Another problem with the product is that it will not record digitally without an optical cable in. You can run a normal digital cable into the recorder, but it records in analog. Overall, a great alternative to MP3 players with its size and flexibility with file types. Awesome memory capacity and power consumption."
3,What About my MD Collection??,"A major shortcoming of this offering is that you cannot convert your existing MDs into mp3 files. I wrongly assumed that since you could place MP3s onto MDs that you could perform the reverse operation, BUT you cannot.Therefore, my existing MDs cannot be converted to mp3s, which is exceedingly frustrating.If anyone knows of an offering where this is possible, would you post it here??"
1,Sony should stand behind their products,"I own a MZ-N505 that was given to me as a gift less than a year ago. This product does not currently put out any sound through the headphones. When I contacted Sony I was told that it was past the 90 day warranty period and that I would have to pay 95 dollars to have it fixed. The unit was only worth 150 dollars when it was given to me. In response to my dismay about the large repair cost, Sony responded there was nothing they could do and I should either pay to have it repaired or buy a new unit. I have bought many Sony products for myself and as gifts of the years but after this fustrating experience I will not buy another Sony product. Why should I when in less than a year it will not work and they will expect me to fork over more money to them. I recommend not purchasing this product."
4,Cool !,"This is pretty cool ! With Mini discs (they are really mini) costing $... each, this beats any Mp3 player on cost. Its size beats any MP3 CD player. Sound is excellent, DOES NOT skip, and it pretty sturdy.Don't have to use OpenMG and get messed up in their copyright protection stuff...I use RealOne and its straight forward...Only downside is the time required for ATRAC conversion. It requires some patience.A winner from Sony. Worth every $."
5,A Perfect Product,"I recently bought the net md mz-n505, and it's great. The software is easy to use works well. After reading other reviews of this product I was concerned about the simplicity of putting MP3's I have recorded off the net onto the player. Well they must be stupid because it couldn't be easier. What I love most about the unit is its size. It is so small and easily fits into your pocket. I highly recommend this product for everyone who demands quality and performance."
5,Great!!! Pure Gold!,I got this minidisc player last week and love it. The software it came with is limited but besides that it is great. I am new to minidisc and found it really easy to use. I put 6 cds on to the minidisc it came with the first day. It is very small which makes it great. You can put on all your track names and stuff right from the player. I would recomend this to anyone who is look for an alternative to cd/mp3. If you want a player to record live concerts this one isn't for you. 5/5!!!!!
4,Great player - annoying software.,"I love the size, battery life and long play formats. However, the packaging is somewhat deceptive. Of course, the device does not play mp3s - instead, one must go through the time consuming process of converting them to the Sony format. A few minor gripes, since the strengths of the device have been covered by others, no protective case or remote is provided, the display is tiny and the headphones stink. Otherwise, a great product at a superb price."
5,Software is OK,"Although the software occassional locks up on mp3 playback, I am otherwise blown away by the ease & convenience of this gizmo. The alternative, a flash card-based device, is just too darned expensive when you strive for comparable storage capacity.Sounds good, runs good, easy to carry, reasonably affordable, more convenient than CDR. No, I don't work for Sony. Added benefit? The technology is still rare enough that you don't have to worry about people asking you to borrow (ruin) CDs.I haven't tried the highest compression yet, but the LP2 mode is quite good."
4,Sony Scores with Net MD,I had the unit installed and 5 CD's recorded to it in less than 2 hours. I spent more time reading the material than required as the software is very intuitive. I have a large playlist of 'favorites' that are going to end up on MD so that I can play them in the car. I plan to use this little guy for travel and when riding the mower in the summer. Great price and great value.
1,Don't buy,"Sony's NetMD software is not user friendly. In about a year after purchasing any Sony MD player you will be unable to record onto the minidisc. You will see a ""Blank"" or ""Error"" on the LCD. I have both the MZ-N505 and MZ-N 707 with the same problem. Buyer beware don't throw away your money on Sony's crappy product."
2,Buy a disc based mp3 player instead,"This product does not play mp3s. It has to convert them to ATRAC, which takes for ever, and eats of disk massive amounts of disk, since you now have copies of your songs in at least 2 different formats. The tranfer to device is reasonably fast over USB, but the conversion from mp3 to ATRAC is no where near as fast as ripping a CD.The disk format does not allow folders within folders, so you cannot group by artist and album.Also, the software has the concept of ""checking out"" music, so you cannot delete a song on the player without connecting to the original computer you used to download.I'm planning on returning this item ASAP, and getting a good Samsung mp3 player instead."
2,Good while it lasted,"I have had this player for a little over a year and a half and it has just stopped recording. I called Sony and they said it can be replaced for $109 (not including tax and shipping & Handling) which is clearly not worth it. I tried to search for a fix online and found that a lot of other people have the same problem with the player. Not only that but the problem occurs at around the same time, a year and a half to two years. Before the problem occured the minidisc was a great player. I would buy a five pack of minidisc and be able to record and carry 25 to 30 cd's worth of material in my pocket. The player is so good that after it broke I still thought about going to get another one, but after reading the other people who have had problems with the system I think I'll be moving back to cd's. It was good while it lasted."
4,Great and almost invincible,"well for the pros- it doesnt skip EVER, the minidiscs are extreemy cheap for what and how much they hold, it is small, light, and tough(dropped it many times and ran it into a wall) the sound is pretty good, can barely tell that it is less than cd quality. convienient, it transfers songs very quickly and if the recording fails (rarely) you can still have the previous songs on it. Cons- no light on the lcd, sometimes the open md jukebox gets corrupt, with it had an aluminum casing just incase it does get smashed somehow. wrapparound headphones, more volume, and the paint eventually comes off of the corners. otherwise its an awesome music player thing. i bought a mp3 player and it doesnt even comeclose to matching my minidisc player, it also sometimes cuts a song in half but to fix it just make it so u cant record back over it."
5,This has got to be the best portable device ever!!!!,"I dont understand why Minidisc is not more popular? It is a great medium, to take the place of cassette tape, cd, etc.... I have been able to consolidate my entire cd collection on to about 15-20 minidiscs, which I can take with me everywhere. I love this thing. The only problem i have is that the minidisc is not more popular. I have been researching the minidisc for a few weeks, and have visited my local Best Buy store, that had no units in stock!! they had a ton of mp3cd players, but no minidisc. What is up with that???? Long live the Minidisc!!"
2,Unuseable software,"Believe all the reviews regarding bad software. I didn't and am now returning as the software crashes continually and renders the hardware useless (Windows XP Home, 512MB Ram). If you like to monkey around with software workarounds and waste a lot of time then the Sony NetMD format is probably OK. But I am going to buy a flash memory MP3 player."
