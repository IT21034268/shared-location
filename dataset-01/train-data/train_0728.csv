2,"Great toy, not made well",My children loved this toy a lot--they had lots of fun with it and two and three-year-olds especially love watching the cars go down. Younger children many need assistance as you have to line the wheels up with the track for it to work. But it was not very well made! Both the stand itself and several of the cars broke even though I supervised my children while they played with it and they did not abuse it. Other manufacturers make similar toys--I plan to replace this with another brand.
1,Disappointed,The cars for some reason to not stay on the track. They launch off the end of each ramp unless your hand is there to block it. I am very dissatisfied.
4,Weeeeee,"My 19 month old son loved this at first. He was fascinated with letting the cars go and watching them. The novelty wore off within a few weeks, but he still plays with it one in a while. It's not something that will keep their attention for more than a few minutes, because it only does one thing: the cars ride down the tracks. It's a nice, well made toy and I am glad I got it for my son, I've also had other parents ask me where I got it."
3,Fun - but watch the wheels,"My son got this in 2008...and while my daughter was playing with it today, I noticed a wheel in her mouth! They were recalled in Canada but not the US (???), but you can call Alex Toys at 800-666-2539 if you have an older model and get replacement cars sent."
2,Does not work properly,2 year old son played with it for 10 minutes after getting as gift and the cars rolled correctly about 10% of time. He came back later to try again and got mad at it. Poorly designed. Wished in laws had asked what he needed. Oh well now we are stuck with it!
2,Broke the second day we had it,"Rainbow Rollers is a fun idea and I was so excited to give it to my son for his birthday. He had a blast with it! But the second day he played with it, the track started to come apart. Needless to say, it didn't last long. Wouldn't recommend this toy, unless they revamp the way it's held together."
2,Price too High and Not well made,"While I have no problem spending money on a nice toy, I was slightly disappointed. This is a sort of toy you could make yourself. When I opened the box (purchased at Learning Express), it had wheels that had come unglued and was clearly cheaply manufactured in China. There was even globs of dried up glue on the bottom (not pretty!) I felt it was asking too much for what it was- should have been like 15 bucks and instead I paid 40. 2 of the cars come attached together and that's not really clear on the box either unless you look at the picture closely. Save your money for another toy!"
4,Rocks my Stereo,CGT is an amazing trio of innovative guitar players that come from or are inspired by the Robert Fripp school of guitarrist. These live interpretations stand as a great overview of both their work and the ability to transform different styles and other's work into the trio's musical style. The three guitar arregements are clever and sometimes so good that it's almost scary. A fine example if Queen's Bohemian Rapsody... It truly blew me away the first time I hear it through my stereo. The trio is also augmented by Tony Levin (another King Crimson member with Fripp) and this provides the needed bass sound to make the trio's sound more complete.This is a band and album for those looking for challeging music in both intelectually and performance wise.
4,good first hand account,"I've always enjoyed reading books written by people who were there. The foot soldier has a unique view, different than that of commanders. My only criticism is that I wish the book were a bit longer. However, it is a free book, so that is only a minor concern."
3,needed more graphic detail,I was looking for more insight from the author about what feelings he had and more graphic detail of what the fighting was like.
5,A Classic!,"Since first published in 1986, this work has been the most representative social survey on experience of sexual violence. It is a classic!Russell describes her monumental study in five parts: study, problem, victims, perpetrators, and families, which involves all the relevant aspects. And each section is rich with case examples and very readable. What fascinates me most is the way she approaches these individuals. This should be a reference for all of those working with violence survivors.Though method of analysis seems a bit out-dated after 15 years, but that is what you expect in classics. Likewise introduction for 1999 edition is not at all concise. You don't need all the details of what happened since the first edition. Because the classic remains the same regardless of time."
3,oops,"Don't buy this if you have a ds lite, it is for the older original version of the ds. i don't know if this is a good product or not since i have a lite and could not use it."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS VACUUM!!!!,"I've had this vacuum for about a year and the only time it had good suction was the 1st time I used it - after that it was all down hill. I use it to clean 2 regular size rooms and a hallway and I have to bang the filter clean after each room. The so called ""powered"" floor wand hardly ever works b/c it runs on the suction power the machine does not have. Every time I vacuum with this thing it takes me 3x longer than it did with my old one. Replacement filters are no where to be found. BUYER BE WARE!!!!"
1,I don't recommend anyone to buy this vacuum,"I bougth this vacuum about a year ago...and now looking for another one. It is terrible on carpets (especially if you have an animal in the house). It's ok for hard wood floors, but I think that if you are looking to buy a vacuum cleaner, you don't want one to clean floors and another one for carpets. That's nuts! Filters are imposibble to buy too!"
4,Great on hardwoods,"I have a small apartment with hardwood floors, so I don't need some big and expensive canister vac to suck dust. What I bought seems to be just as good the larger, higher priced models. This thing has great suction; you'll need to clean the filters often, but even if you don't, it will still suck well. It's easy to tap them into a wastebasket, and every 8-10 runnings, you should run the filters under the water faucet. The attachments are fine. The cord rolls up into the machine, which is nice. The exhaust gets a little warm, so make sure there is enough room around the unit for air flow. If your place is larger than 1100 or 1200 sqft, you may want to get something bigger. I'm satisfied!"
1,Not for houses with heavy use,"If you only accumulate light dust in your house, I guess this good looking yet useless machine MIGHT do.I am going to try the Dyson DC07 because I am sick of kneeling on my carpet to ""scrub"" the nozel over each bit."
1,Terrible Vacuum... do not buy!,"I bought this vacuum today because I thought euro-pro was a good name. But, when I got it home, the power cord was about only 1 1/2 feet long, and I had to bend over to even vacuum. I am very disappointed in this vacuum. I have returned it already. Didn't even have it for 1 hour."
3,Seems Like a Lot of Work to Clean!,"Since I have mostly tile floors, I wanted a good canister vac that would be easier to ""pull"" around than my expensive upright. I finally decided on the Shark Euro-Pro Bagless vacuum. This vac claimed to have the most suction power and the filter was ""tap"" to clean. After receiving the vac and reading the manual, I found that there are actually three filters and all have to be replaced every so many months. There was no information on where to buy the filters. The vac does seem to have the power, but the manual states that the power will deminish if the filters are not cleaned/replaced properly. The clean-up of the filters is a time consuming job and must be done after each use. The vac comes with two floor tools (one powered). I use the power tool for all cleaning (tile and carpet). The way the floor tools swivel at the end of the wand makes getting into small places easy."
3,Lightweight - a little too lightweight,"This vacuum is lightweight as advertised. It has good suction, however, the rotating floor brush is air driven and doesn't really get the job done if you do any heavy cleaning. I have to take the hose off and just use the bare hose to clean up a lot of things from my carpet."
4,Very Poor Customer Service,"I have been attempting for two months to get a replacement head that broke off after only having the machine for four months. I called for the third time only to be told the part is on ""back order"" and they cannot tell me when it will be in. I liked the machine so much that I purchased one for my daughter, who is having the same problem now as I -- and can get no answers."
5,Luck of the Draw,"I bought this CD for one song, and one song only, 'I Can't Make You Love Me.' Bonnie Raitt sings this song like no other, with heart and grit. I get emotional every time I here it. Can't really comment on the rest of the CD because that's the only song I play."
5,Bonnie Raitt,Thank u so much for the CD. It's great. I use to have this CD years ago so i wanted it again. It came in good time and it was better than i expected it to be. So im enjoying it! Thanx
5,edtac56,"I would like to say how great this company was about notifying me that they received my order and my CD was shipped the next day to me first class. I received it in three days. I would definately recommend ordering from edtac56, as their service and their merchandise is tops. (My order was ""Luck of the Draw"" Bonnie Raitt)"
5,Romance,"The c.d arrived in perfect shape! Bonnie Raitt is great! It is a great c.d for couples! Thank you,Scott Kyle"
5,Homerun,"This one's outta' the park for Bonnie.She's hit a grandslam and the other team's in shambles. There's not a bad song on the entire Cd (which is odd because I generally don't like every song on anyone's album). Delbert McClinton lends his soulfull voice and John Hiatt wrote a song or two. Not bad players to have on your team, eh?"
4,Good Solid Read,"Picked this up when I stumbled across the customer reviews on Amazon; I liked and enjoyed a lot, did not get the ""can't put it down"" feeling the other reviewers did; But great writing and great characters; understanding the love between two men and understanding what this disease can do directly and indirectly to so many individuals; Like the story line that built on the love for Rich, love of his career and how health took it all."
2,Beware of buying,"I purchased this backpack in December. It was nice at first, but then stitching started coming loose and the inside pocket has a big hole in it (only lipstick went in that pocket) Due to Amazon's return policy (30 days) they were not able to help me with the bag. The Amazon Support was wonderful. They did help me find a number so I could call Prada.Prada would not honor their quality of the backpack because I bought it at Amazon. If I bought it in a store, they would fix it for me. The first person I spoke to at Prada Corp. was rude and condescending. The second person I spoke to was much nicer, but once she found out I bought the backpack on Amazon, she was a little bit condescending.The moral of the story is, I won't buy Prada from Amazon again due to being stuck with a substandard product and no way to ensure Prada will fix it."
2,Same situation as the first review.,My fiance bought this bag for me. Within 2 weeks the straps/handles ripped off. Amazon wouldn't do anything (between purchase date and actually using it - it was past 30 days). Prada also would not exchange or even fix it. Condescending staff. I had the bag fixed at a show cobbler. The interior lining also ripped very easily.Luxury good? Not so much.
1,Fake,"I believe that these must be fake. Please take a look at the emblem on the inside lining. If the logo edges are not perfectly clear, then it is fake. Also in the genuine article, the nylon is thicker and more durable. The nylon does not wrinkle neat the leather trim. Also, the stitching is very durable."
3,The Confessions of St. Augustine,I was introduced to this book by watching EWTN. Many scholars have said this book is truly a wonderful book to read. It is highly intellectual. It will take an average reader a considerable amount of time to fully comprehend its impact.Do not give up. Read it slowly. It is profound.
3,"Complex Ideas, Difficult to Read","Despite a superb translation, ""Confessions"" was not the autobiographical classic that I had hoped. Broadly, the first half details Augustine's pre-conversion life and paints an interesting portrait of life in ancient Italy. The relationships and stuggles that he details are as relevant today as there were in centuries past. The second half, however, is profoundly theological and lacks the personal touch I had hoped for. Similar to Emerson's essays, Augustine writes chapters on various aspects of bibical literalness and catholic doctrine. I found these musings to be difficult to follow and disconnected. A profound work, but one that the reader needs to be prepared for."
4,"Great literature, Difficult to read","This is a wonderful piece of classic christian literature. I would certainly recommend it to anyone wanting to dig a little deaper. But be warned, it is difficult to read. That's the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars. I struggled through it, enjoying his words, but wrestling with the language."
2,only good as a supplement,"This CD helped me add some vocabulary to the Croatian I had learned from other sources. But just repeating isolated words is a very ineffective way to learn a language, especially one with so few English cognates, and it's misleading to imply that it can be done quickly. (""In Flight""? Are you kidding?!) I worked first with Pimsleur, then with a book called Teach Yourself Croatian, and only then did I find the In-Flight Croatian any help at all -- and only after listening to it over and over and over in the car. Very boring. The good thing is that it DOES provide some new vocabulary, which I needed."
3,This thing is big!,This thing is huge!! It is much bigger than it looks. Otherwise good quality in manufacturing.
1,Pyramid Bicycle 9/16 in Low Fat Type Plastic Mountain Pedals with Clips and Straps,"The pedals felt great and had excellent grip on the road, but the interior structure is made of plastic and broke under heavy (daily) use over a three month period. If you off road, ride trails, or are heavy user of your bicycle a complete metal or alloy pedal would hold up better. A great pedal with strap and clips, but not for extreme biking."
3,Good device - not great.,Pen works well enough. Really liked the old BD pen which was discontinued. This pen is not at sturdy. But works well enough.
2,disapppointing,"After reading all the rave reviews I ordered this DVD. It's terrible. You flop around like an idiot pretending to do sports moves, then the cardio part is over in only 20 minutes. I could have done all this without a DVD. The people in the video are really irritating, too, shouting lots of ""woo!""s and ""yeah!""s and my personal favorite ""you're a rock star."" The whole thing is annoying and an unsatisfying workout."
5,excellent workout,"Great workout. Initially, I didn't know whether I should choose individual segments or if I should do the entire thing, but I did the entire thing and I was worked out. I even opted to choose the cardio segment and the strength segment separately and it was still great. The environment Amy Dixon creates with her assistants/cohorts in the back was extremely motivating and upbeat. I would recommend this to anyone... even beginners (who just need a bit of practice)."
5,Amy is my FAVORITE,I have all of Amy's workout DVDs and I love all of them. She is a great instructor. Her cueing is good. She is encouraging without being annoying.The workout itself is challenging. After a vacation of sitting on the beach I came home to workout with Amy again and I was really tired. It's amazing how much endurance and strength you loose in a short time! I specifically like the segmenting of the video. This morning I did the cardio portion and tomorrow I will do the strength portion. I workout in the morning and don't always have enough time for a full workout.
5,Perfect Workout,I am 49 years old and have not worked out in years and this DVD is the perfect one to start back up again. The work out is gentle on my knees but yet good enough to keep me motivated. I love this DVD it was like it was made just for me.
5,Amy Dixon is my new best friend!,"This is an awesome DVD. I love that there are three different sections so I can mix and match. The workout is hard, but not impossible. Amy cues very well, and she is motivating without being obnoxious! I am steadily losing the baby weight!"
5,You MUST check her music out!!,"Ember Swift is an amazing singer/songwriter. Seeing her live, with her longtime musical partner Lyndell Montgomery (who is also an awesome musician and poet), is an unforgettable experience. They are smart, funny, talented women who have much insight into life, and their music reflects all of that. If Ember plays in your area, don't miss the show, and BUY THIS CD!"
5,They Were Big In Utah,"I bought this CD when it first came out and have ended up replacing it several times over the years because it gets borrowed and never returned.Fuzzbox is another band in the long list of bands that should have been bigger than they were (Hanoi Rocks, Jellyfish, D'Molls).The songs in this CD are well constructed and performed, and still stand the test of time.Fuzzbox started out with a rougher punk sound and finished with a more polished hard rocking Bangles sort of sound."
2,Caution -- track list descriptions could be inaccurate.,"Just ordered and received this CD, but there are only 2 songs instead of the 4 most people are describing below. There are two different versions available, so you may need to confirm with the seller which one you are ordering."
4,Not Bitter,"""Bittersweet Me"" is a strong rocker from the New Adventures in Hi-Fi album. It has a nice guitar riff and catchy chorus. The three bonus tracks are strong especially an inspired cover of Glen Campbell's ""Wichita Lineman""."
4,Gluten Free,I was very excited to finally purchase this book. It is so helpful and easy to follow. Excited to make the recipes.
3,very nice book,"I briefly looked through this book and then I returned it. The recipes look great. However, I live in a very rural area and have trouble getting all the different flours needed for the recipes."
5,The Best Gluten-Free Family Cookbook,"If you are gluten intolerant or wheat sensitive, this is a ""must-have"" cookbook. I have tried quite a few of the recipes. In almost all cases, the results were a superior, tasty product. In fact, my family, which is not gluten intolerant, prefers the muffin and waffle recipes over traditional wheat products. As a final bonus, the authors have incorporated higher fibre and nutrient dense grains to guard against nutrional deficiencies."
3,Just ok...,"This cookbook was ok, but seemed to have MANY ingredients to make each thing. If you have a lot of time, then I guess it would be worth it."
5,Finally!,"I purchased this book for my mother. She was recently diagnosed with allergies to wheat (gluten). She already tried a couple of recipes and loves this book. It is a must have in her opinion. She has found some of the ingredients difficult to find in her small town, however they travel to a larger metropolitan area about once a month and she picks up what ingredients she needs there at a health food store."
2,Lullaby of Broadway,"I am very dissapointed with this product. I played it only once and The second time I tried it my blu ray disc player rejected it, didn't read it. Unfortunately is my fault since I din't notice it was a library copy and a very used one. I am so very sorry because I had grest expectations about it."
2,Old Musical,This is a fairly entertaining musical movie but doesn't compare with the old MGM musicals. Doris Day is always good but the movie doesn't hold up with the changing times.
5,does what it is supposed to do,Fit right into my Intel case. Be sure to get a suitable power supply if you're going to add drives.
1,junk,these blades are junk. the supplier probably bought a batch of seconds. they are not sharp and barely good for one shave!!
5,Gilette Sensor Excel(lent) Refills,"Ordered the 30 pack several months ago and received them within a short time. Had some concerns about quality after what a few people wrote, but after opening the first pack and starting to use them I realized that my concerns appear to be of no consequence. The first blade appears to be of excellent quality. Extremely sharp and gives a good, close shave. Just what I expect from the Excel blades. If the other twenty-nine are anything like the first, then these will have been an excellent choice. The package states that they were made by Gilette in Germany and appears that these were made to be distributed in Australia."
2,not Sensor Excel,"In other words this *isn't* 10 Sensor Excel cartridges, it's 9 or 10 regular Sensor without the microfin rubber, and *one* Sensor Excel blade. It's bad that merchants mislead in Amazon postings about what they're selling, what its UPC code is, what the product photo is. Buyer beware."
5,Good buy!,"With Gillette moving on to newer razors with more expensive cartridges (ones with more blades), I am content to keep using my Sensor. Most discount retailers and wholesale clubs don't stock the refills and if they do, they are priced higher than this. Well-priced."
3,Gillette Sensor Excel Refills,"The order arrived quickly and seems to be of the same quality as the locally purchased refills. The only difference is that the local ones are manufactured in Brazil and the ones I received in this order are made in New Zealand. But as I said the quality seems the same so far. My only complaint is that I also ordered an excel razor handle as part of the same order and although they were all shipped together, I was double charged for shipping. This Is the same as I would have paid if I had ordered them as two separate orders and received them in two separate shipments. Otherwise I would have given a five star rating."
1,Counterfeit blades?,"Absolute horrible out of the box - painfully dull blades. Packaging references Gillette UK and blades visibly different than those from reputable local sources. Judging by suspicious packaging and poor quality, suspect these may be counterfeit product. Will be contacting both Amazon and the seller regarding this purchase. DO NOT BUY!"
3,Very honest review,"What I like about this blade is that they are super cheap these days. I got 30 blades for $35! I used these blades from 1993- 2000 and just went back to them when things got put on a very tight budget at home. Who wants to pay $20 for 4 fusion blades that are just out of hand. Here is the deal that I hate to admit the 4 blade fusion blades do a much better job , when I use the Sensor excels I tend to get cut easily and have a 5 o clock shadow by 10pm. I'm going to use these until the economy gets better but I admit I miss my fusion blades. OH AND JUST AN FYI I was going to try the Mach 3 blades from Amazon since they looked like a good deal but sounds like a bunch of fakes are floating around so watch out"
5,"I don't need 4, 5 or more blades","I think the razor industry is getting carried away in their desire to seem innovative. 4 blades? 5 blades?? The Sensor Excel works well, and the head is narrow enough to not be unwieldy in small spots like under the nose. I'll keep buying these as long as they make them. I'm just afraid they will stop because they think they can charge more for more blades."
4,The Zealot in My Closet: Searching for God in All the Wrong Places,"Joshua Watson grew up in the fundamentalist churches of Hillsborough County, Florida and has lived to tell the tale in his book The Zealot in my Closet. Aside from a full-time job and college schedule, he also writes and speaks on the flaws of Christian fundamentalism and the growing views of Progressive Christianity. He has written for sites such as RawStory.com and was once the mind behind the site CureIgnorance.com."
2,No Ending,"The dvd ,cracking the profetic code I had seen before but I didn't own it and wanted to see it over again. Big mistake buying it here. I had to stop it several times and rerun several times just to get it to work , and after it seemed to finally be on track it stoped 15 min befor the end. The recording was good when it was playing but with all the stopping and skipping I definatly won't buy at this site again and be leary about other sites selling religous material."
3,"Good songs, pleasant voice","Suzy Bogguss is probably one of the best kept secrets in country music. She has never really been a huge superstar like some other female artists, but her music is perhaps more real, heartfelt and honest than some other singers. She does not have a belting, shrieking voice like Martina McBride or Reba McEntire. And she is not as flashy or ""pop-sounding"" like Shania Twain or Faith Hill. She just sings pure, simple songs with her rich, textured voice.This is probably her best studio album with strong cuts such as ""Outbound Plane"", ""Someday Soon"", ""Letting Go"" and the title track ""Aces"". I first bought this CD back in the early 90's when it was originally released. The tracks don't seem a bit dated all these years later.If you are just looking for a Suzy Bogguss hits package that incorporates all of her hits, check out her ""Greatest Hits"". Recommended."
1,waste!,The light wont go out. We just installed it tonight and its starting out with the light not turning off. So..figuring this will only last a couple weeks until the batteries die. At least I bought it when it was on sale and only lost $5.00 buying this.
1,could be great if it continued to work,"This could be a great faucet light if it just worked for more than two weeks. I have had two of these fail now. The first one ran for a week and a half, and then the light wouldn't go off. I took it apart, dried it, changed batteries... it wouldn't go out. I tried everything. So I bought another, figuring I had just been unlucky. The next one worked just great for two weeks, and then it wouldn't go out. So I did all the same things over again: I couldn't get it to go out. Obviously I can't change batteries every 2 days, so I have to consider this product faulty and not worthy of purchase. It's a nice faucet, too; I'm really disappointed it doesn't function properly. I can't figure out why nobody else has had this problem here. I'm already $40 in the hole; I give up."
2,Washed out,"I can't give it more than two stars for breaking so quickly. Bought this over a year ago. Worked great for a few days! Got to show it off, everyone was impressed. How futuristic! But then the light wouldn't turn off, so I removed it from the faucet and took out the battery to save it. Unfortunately, this product is only impressive if attached to the faucet. I never reinstalled it. Bottom line: don't spend the money if you can't afford to lose it."
1,NOT SO UNLOCKED PHONE,PRODUCT ADDVERTISED AS MOTOROLA RIZR Z3 ULOCKED GSM QUADBAND CELL PHONE-BLACK. EVENTHOUGH THE PHONE IS TAGED TO T-MOBIL'S OPERATING SYSTEM AND WILL NOT LET ALL MY ATT NETWORK WORK.CALLED SELLER AND HE ADVISED THAT I CONTACT T-MOBIL FOR HELP/ THEY COULDN'T.
1,Did anyone edit this book?,"The writing is erratic. The information is suspect and does not actaully explain a number of things. Having to flip several pages to get to a referenced illustration is also really irritating.I certainly won't be using this as an admin reference, and I won't take a stab at the CCSA until I can track down a number of things that either aren't explained to my satisfaction, or that I find the author's explanations of contradictory to what I know."
5,A classic Christmas Album,"This is one of the great classic Christmas albums. The Beach Boys included original tunes like ""Little Saint Nick"" and ""The Man With All the Toys."" These tunes are now standard tunes heard during the holidays. The tune ""Christmas Day,"" is a very pretty song. But the highlights are the older established songs. Brian Wilson's vocal arrangements are magical. ""White Chritmas"" and ""I'll be Home for Christmas"" are beautiful renditions of these well worn tunes. While many pop artists fail to capture the Christmas spirit on their holiday albums, this recording shows the true musical ability of this venerable group."
5,I Love This Beach Boys Christmas CD!,This is an awesome Christmas CD and I'm so glad that I purchased this one! I love all of the songs from the more traditional ones to the songs to the modern ones by Brian Wilson ad I love the alternate take tracks on several songs and I highly recommend this CD!
2,Mopar Six-Pack Carbs,I was very dissapointed in this book as I thought it would delve more into how to set-up a six-pack but instead this goes into the history of the six-pack instead showing which cars had them etc. Virtually NO information even as how to set the linkage or vacuum lines...
5,Everday Blessings,Worthwhile reading for time-strapped parents who want to be more present in their everday interaction with their children.
5,a must read for all parents,Highly recommended. I keep this book within reach and often pick it up and read a chapter when in need.Truly feel like this book helps me realize I can be a mindful parent and it does create peace within the house.I have two boys that have a lot of spirit- now it's time my husband reads it!
5,the best parenting book I have ever read,"Since becoming a new mother in February of 1999, I have read every parenting book I can get my hands on. This one was given to me as a gift and I have had a hard time putting it down. I have even written excerpts into my journal. Some of the words are so beautiful I find myself reading them out loud! I am a single Mom who struggles with finances and raising a little boy on my own. This book has helped me appreciate each moment with my son and find the good things in every day. It has truly changed my life and I plan to share it with other new mothers as well. I feel fortunate to have found it this early in my journey as a parent!"
5,Helps to keep life with my son in perspective,"I keep this book next to my bed and dip into it whenever I feel like I need some perspective on the wonderful (but often frustrating) life of parenthood. I never really got into ""Wherever You Go..."" (maybe wasn't yet ready?), but this book feels really on the mark about the emotional, intellectual and spiritual issues that surface while raising a child."
3,Tepid,"The Kabat-Zinns have written a unique book in as much as it is one of the very few that apply mindfulness to parenting. Those portions of the book, where this application is described, are very good. Afterall, Jon Kabat-Zinn has done a fair bit towards popularizing this form of meditative practice. However, the book falters when the authors advise about bringing up children and disciplinary issues. They fail to distinguish, in any practical way, between utter laissez faire and much-needed corrective action. The reader is left to his/her own devices to figure out a path that should be followed. Well, one really does not need a book to tell us that the path is unique and must be forged by each parent. The manner in which mindfulness can help in charting this path is poorly described.Overall, I recommend this book only for a few chapters (approx. 75 pages) that are very good. The rest does nothing to improve parenting skills."
5,The ultimate feel-good movie,"This is one of my ultimate ""feel-good"" movies. If I'm feeling down or blue, all I have to do is pop this into the VCR and I'm soon feeling chipper again. Just hearing the theme song can cheer me up. Maybe it's because this movie came out the year I turned 16 and it reminds me of a happier, simpler time in the U.S. Two of my favorites, Dom De Luise and Paul Lynde, are charming and hillarious as supporting cast.I agree: this SHOULD DEFINITELY be put out in DVD in widescreen! Extra features such as an interview with and commentary by Doris Day would make this a true collector's edition. Anyone listening?"
3,About The Glass Bottom Boat,"I am a huge Doris Day fan, I bought this remembering it from when I was a kid, it must have been funnier then I guess. Not worthy of her, Paul Lynde made this film watchable"
3,DORIS DAY AND ROD TAYLOR IN A 1960'S MUSICAL COMEDY,"A spy theme (a la James Bond--all the rage at the time) with songs (none very good) and laughs (far to few) that, for the most part, is boring to mediocre. That about covers it, unfortunately. Except for the few scenes with DICK MARTIN (LAUGH IN) that I thought were really funny, this is just an historical piece of cinema (it does have a GREAT CAST that is wasted on a poor script). Despite all the 5 star reviews posted in this forum, I have to give this one a THUMBS DOWN. At best, it's just barely OK."
2,Times sure change,"I saw this film years ago and loved it. NOw seeing it, I can not watch more than a few minutes. EIther it has changed(it has not, of course) or I have changed. Geez, at the time, Ms. Day's daring costumes were considered risque', whereas now, noone would take the slightest note; sort of an early Lady GAGA."
2,Glass Bottom Boat,"This had to be the most boring and horrible films to ever come from MGM. Fortyish Doris Day trying to act like she's twenty, an red-faced Rod Taylor trying to act big time. I bought it to see Eric Fleming, who had been the star of RAWHIDE. Too bad Eric wasn't the leading man in it!"
5,Check out the U.N.C.L.E. cameo!,"In the party scene, there was a cameo that had me on the floor -- watch closely when Paul Lynde (in blue sequined dress and towering red wig) is on his way to the bathroom. He passes, of all people 'Napoleon Solo' of ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E."" played by Robert Vaughn! UNCLE was a huge hit at the time, and no doubt this was an in joke, as the company that made 'boat' also made 'UNCLE'---You even hear the UNCLE theme music as Solo turns around! Now if only they sneaked Ilya Kuriakin in there!Great, silly movie, Doris is fab as always, and Rod Taylor is as sophisticatedly sexy as ever!"
3,Very Mild,"Doris Day and a galaxy of great character actors give expert performances in this story of an innocent tour guide who is suspected of being a spy--but very regrettably, the script is not up to their talents, and the story quickly degenerates into a series of loose ends. Still, Day's light touch with comedy and charming turns from the likes of Arthur Godfrey, Paul Lynde, and Dom DeLuise are very enjoyable on their own; viewers who don't expect too much will be amused."
4,"""The Glass Bottom Boat"" - Doris Day","I bought ""Glass Bottom Boat"" to add to my Doris Day movie collection. It's not the best of best but it comes close to it."
5,I Love this movie!,"This has been one of my all time fav movies sense I was a child and is a fav of my grown daughters as well. Funny, witty and a great family movie!"
4,Quality movie,"As bright and colorful a movie today, as when it was produced. Often these great actors of the past simply produce a better movie."
5,A Family Favorite That Also Spoofs '60s Spy Films,"This movie is able to be a sweet Doris Day comedy while adding the sarcastic humor of Paul Lynde to become a spoof of '60s spy films. It's a nice mixture of what would have been pretty adult material with family fun. The supporting cast is filled with comedians at the top of their game. And though Rod Taylor is an acquired taste as a Day leading man, he seems to fit his hard-nosed scientist role. Most fun is seeing Arthur Godfrey in a great film debut. Yes, he sings and Doris sings (Que Sera Sera again!). But it all moves quickly and has enough action that it keeps the whole family's attention."
5,Surprisingly durable educational tool!,"If you're looking at abacuses, you probably already know all the uses - patterns, counting, basic mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, and basic multiplication). In the packaging Melissa & Doug provides a longer list of uses as well, which was helpful.While I use this with my preschooler, my toddler is fascinated by it as well. It is well made, but the most surprising durability has come from my little guy standing and jumping on it when it's laying on its side. He likes the feel of the beads, and his 25 pounds don't even cause it to flex. (I do try to keep him off of it, but life happens. ;))"
5,"Not so much made, as built.",Strong solid construction. Made for use. Very good value.Very useful even for adults. And NO BATTERIES REQUIRED!Highly recommended.
3,Not a real abacus,"Although many reviewers tout this toy as highly educational, I find that beyond working on color recognition, fine motor skills, and simple counting, this toy is very limited because it is not a real abacus. Yes, it has beads on wires that you push back and forth, but it doesn't have the right number of beads grouped together. There should be groups of two beads and five beads in a row--not 10 all together."
4,Quality Abacus,"I'm not sure why other reviewers have complained about this being dangerous for younger children. I have three kids and bought this to help my daughter with math. My youngest just turned four and I don't see where it poses any danger to her. Children any younger shouldn't have one of these anyway because the purpose is for counting and math, and it's just not necessary to 2 year olds. The metal rods are plenty durable, the wood pieces are screwed together solidly. If a child breaks this, then he's a destructive kid. Yes, beads would be dangerous for babies, but again, it's not meant for babies. I thought this was a great buy, and is much better quality than Walmart junk."
4,great toy!,"Though it seems like it would be a boring toy, this is great for my 3-year-old who is currently obsessed with counting everything, all the time. We've had fun making patterns with the different colored beads as well. The base piece of wood is a bit warped, however, so it doesn't sit flat. It doesn't really detract from the fun of the toy though--just makes it a bit wobbly."
4,Great learning toy but it should be wider...,With the help of this toy my daughter now gets what adding and subtracting means. I wish it was wider to actually give better visualization when separating one side from the other. It needs to be at least 3/4 longer in my opinion.
1,Not for little kids,"Our kids were 4 and under. The abacus fell apart, exposing 10 pointy metal sticks and dropping wooden balls all over the floor. Choking hazard. Toy did not work out for us. Maybe for older kids."
3,Good product,"We bought this for our 3 year old, so that he can develop his counting skills - so far he has not shown much interest in using it for counting. But it seems like a sturdy and colorful abacus and we are hoping he'll soon develop interest in using it."
3,unsteady base,The base on the abacus I got is badly warped. I will have to somehow build up a corner or edge to keep the abacus from rocking too much. I imagine this is not a common problem.
5,"Well made, very sturdy.","Well made, hefty piece. Very sturdy. Great educational tool and kids love it, they think its a toy and fight over it."
2,"NOT a ""classic abacus""...however it's a good ""counting frame""","This product is NOT a ""classical"" abacus; the true Chinese abacus has thirteen stacks of beads with two each in an upper section and five each in a lower section! This is a ""counting frame;"" which is good for children to use to learn counting by ones and tens."
1,ugh,"my wife bought this and had me hang it up for her one day. Within several hours, i felt so nauseated from the unhealthy toxic stench that I had to rip it down and toss it away from my apartment. It took another 3 hours of several fans blowing air from the outside to get the smell out.ugh."
1,it sucks (not litterally),"I bought this vacuum less then a year ago. It now stops in the middle of my vacuuming. It leaves black marks on my new white carpet. It is sooooo hard to push. To empty the canister it takes about 30 minutes you have to turn the knob until you get fed up and then you have to get a stick or something long to push all the dirt and dust out which then goes in your face and gets you all dusty, not good if you have allergies. This all has happened in less then a year. I now have to go and buy another vacuum, because this one turns off by itself. Oh and it also has lost it's suction. Not even worth it if it cost $20.00"
1,Dust Blaster,"When I call it a dust blaster it is not meant as a compliment. This vauume worked really well the first few months I owned it. In the first year the belt broke, one of the lights went out, the plastic holder for the attachments broke off and I was constantly running over the cord. Now the hose has no suction and at times it blasts dust out the back. I would not suggest anyone buy this vacuume. I had a Hoover for 10 years. I never had any trouble out of it. I'm going back to purchase a Hoover!"
1,Total junk!!! Do not buy this item,"I wish I read the reviews before I bought my twister at J.C Penneys. Like many others, after owning a Fantom Fury for many years it was a no brainer to buy the twister after my Fury died after 5 years of service. Their is a MAJOR electrical problem with these units that causes them to turn on and off while vacuuming. I have had 2 that had the same problem and Penneys won't take them back after 30 days. Euro-pro customer lack of service department wants you to pay shipping back to the company then pay shipping back to you only to get another bad unit. Plus you have to do without your vacumm for 6-8 weeks. Ridiculous!!!!!"
2,I give up!,I like many other have experienced the power going off/on while cleaning. I have owend the vacuum for about 2 years and was pleased with the cleaning ability. I was about to take it to a repair shop and read some of the reviews. I will invest my money in something else.
1,Not Even Worth One Star,Save your time & money. I have Low to Low/Med Carpets and the motor would slow down and the brush would sometimes come to a complete stop. The light went out in the first month. To empty the container is a mess...you have to dig your hand into it and pull out the dirt or take the whole thing apart. It's very top heavy and will fall backwards...I could go on.Believe it or not the best vacuum cleaner I ever had was the Thunder...that's why I bought the twister. Just returned from where I bought it (Thank God for their $20/4 yr policy) and they were very nice to exchange it...I just paid the difference. Don't even bother calling the Fantom company...you will go round and round with them. I now am the proud owner of a Hoover.
1,Electrical Failure after 3 uses,"I had a Fantom Lightning canister model for 5 or 6 years. No trouble. I purchased the Twister to replace it. The Twister started out strong. After 3 uses the motor burned up. After looking at the reviews, I'm gonna try a different brand. It seems like others have had the same problem."
4,Love the Twister,The Fantom was everything I thought it would be. It was easy to maneuver for a fairly sturdy machine. The bottom emptying dust bin was a great improvement from my old vacuum. I really did not want to spend this much money but I'm glad I did.
1,Don't waste your money,"My husband and I bought our first Fantom when we were married in 1999. We absolutely loved it. It finally gave way in September '03. Naturally we had a good experience with the first Fantom so we automatically bought this one. Worst mistake ever. It broke down within the first month, it (We've only had this vacumm for only 6 months) would constantly loose power. We took it to a local dealer and we were told this is the NOT the vacumm to own. Needless to say it was fixed but broke down again a week later. Called the company and the only option given was to ship it, which takes about 8 weeks to get back. So not only did we loose the money we paid to purchase this, but now we would have to pay for shipping. BUYER BEWARE!!!!!"
1,Awful! A big waste of money!,This vacuum was a waste of money. I had it for about six months and then it broke. It is very heavy and hard to manuever. The wand that pops out is not long enough to do a decent job of cleaning anything. It tends to fall over a lot when using the attachments. The twisting handle that empties the dirt does not work. The only way to get the dirt out is to pull the large clumps out with your hand. I would never buy/recommend this product to anyone. It also does a horrible job of picking stuff of of smooth floors or low pile carpet.
1,don't waste your money,"This vacuum is junk. My roller brush assembly burnt out after 3 months. Customer service is terriable, its the worst I ever dealt with. This vacuum is very cheaply made and like the others the lights and belts go out fast. This is my third and last fantom product. The good reviews are probally people who work for fantom.Please don't waste your money on this product."
1,Worst Vacuum I have ever owned!!,Today I am returning my second Fantom Twister to Target. The first one lasted about a month before it started making an awful noise. I think it was one of the bearings on the brush going out. The second one that I am returning today made it about a week before the belt broke. So I though no big deal and just replaced it with the one that was in the box. It worked for about two weeks after that and now it won't even turn on. We bought this vacuum because it was a good value for what we thought we were getting. Don't be fooled by the fancy exterior of this vacuum. It is poorly constructed and will not last very long. Avoid this vacuum at all cost.
5,SATISIFIED USER,I HAVE BEEN USING THE FATHOM THUNDER SINCE 1996. I ALSO LET MY KIDS USE IT BECAUSE WE ALL HAVE DOGS AND ALL THE OTHER VACUUMS THEY HAVE DID NOT GET THE HAIR. I HAVE NEVER EVER HAD A VACUUM THAT PICKS UP LIKE THIS ONE. IT EVEN OUT DID THE MORE EXPENSIVE ONES PEOPLE CHALLENGED ME WITH. I AM SORRY TO SAY I WORE IT OUT AND WAS TRYING TO GET IT TO LAST TILL THE NEW ONE CAME OUT. I AM THRILLED IT HAS MADE IT ON THE MARKET AND AM SURE IT WILL BE A NUMBER 1 SELLER AGAIN AS THEY ARE MADE TO LAST AND GET THE JOB DONE. MY HAT IS OFF TO THE MANUFACTURER OF THE FATHOM.
1,it sucks (not litterally),"I bought this vacuum less then a year ago. It now stops in the middle of my vacuuming. It leaves black marks on my new white carpet. It is sooooo hard to push. To empty the canister it takes about 30 minutes you have to turn the knob until you get fed up and then you have to get a stick or something long to push all the dirt and dust out which then goes in your face and gets you all dusty, not good if you have allergies. The hose that is for the attatchments came out of the it's so then naturally it doen't suck anything up. It's cheaply made. This all has happened in less then a year. I now have to go and buy another vacuum, because this one turns off by itself. Oh and it also has lost it's suction. Not even worth it if it cost $20.00 This doesn't even deserve 1 star!!"
1,Good Vacuum.......When it works,"Just purchased the Twister in December. My wife and I have four cats and one dog so I needed one that works well for pet hair. I was very happy with the suction power of the vacuum. It worked well on the carpets and tile floor. The turbo brush attachment worked great on getting pet hair off the furniture. This past week it started having electrical problems. The motor will stop while vacuuming, but the light stays on. I called the company and they said that my only option was to ship the vacuum back to them and they will fix or replace it. I was told this would take 6 to 8 weeks. It seems I'm not the first person to have electrical problems with this vacuum. I would not recommend this vacuum to anyone."
2,worked at first!,This vacuum worked great the first time.After that it would shut down constantly due to the short in the system.Worst vacuum I ever owned.
3,Fantom of the Terrible,"I received this vacuum cleaner as a Christmas gift. At first the suction was great and I loved how the on/off switch was big and easy to turn on and off with my hand instead of a kick switch (on/off button at the base of the vacuum cleaner). But unfortunately within months the vacuum started losing suction fast, so I took it to the repair shop and I was back in business (so I thought). About a month later the suction started to fade and I felt that I had just gotten a bad vacuum cleaner out of the bunch. After reading several reveiws I see that this vacuum cleaner ""sucks"" and might I add the head lamp worked only one time but it made the machine give off so much heat, that I would work up a sweat every time I used the darn thing. Once the canister got 1/4"" full the vacuum cleaner became very heavy and dragged across the carpet hardly sucking up anything. No setting seemed to work. This is an item for the dumpster."
1,One Night Stand,This charger worked as advertised a grand total of one time before it failed. I left my iPod in the charger for several hours on at least three other occasions with no real measurable results (the battery charge status light did not change from orange to green). I charged the iPod via one of the USB ports on my PC for about three hours and the battery status light changed from orange to green. So much for the portable charger.
2,not sure if it works...,I purchased this one and the car adapter and they don't charge my zune at all...I don't know if it's a problem with the zune or with these items...but via usb it charges perfectly...
5,Works well,This adapter works well in charging my iPod Shuffle 4th Generation. I was previously only charging it on my computer so using a wall outlet is a welcome option.
4,Good for price,"It charges my iPod 4gen pretty well, but when I plug it into the wall, a red spark the size of a small piece of rice appears.Overall, it's a good product if you want an inexpensive USB charger.I live in Canada, by the way. That may have an effect on the charger..."
2,Glitchy,"I suppose due to its generic nature, the charger is quite useless if you plan on using your iPod/iPhone while it's charging. As it is working, it causes several technical issues, such as freezing, glitches, and crashes. It does, however, charge.Buy this only if you are DESPERATE for a cheap charger. If not, just spend a few more dollars and get a better, more reliable one."
5,Pistons Videos,"What an excellent product! And delivered in less time than recommended. Great quality. My husband now has hours of playoff games of his favorite team ""DEEE-troit BAS-ketball!"""
5,A Basketball Lover's Dream,"This Pistons team won championships when the NBA was at it's peak, when Bird, McHale, Magic, Barkley, Jordan, Olajuwon, Drexler, Ewing, Dominique, etc. etc. were in their prime. The Bulls, for instance, had their dynasty when the league was at it's low point . . . Jordan beating Magic, Barkley, Isiah and whoever was on the Sonics in 96 when they were all past their prime. NBA history to me is made up of the Celtics, Lakers and Pistons, and that's what makes this collection a must-have for any real fan of the game."
5,NBA DVD -you've swindled me again...,"I hate the Pistons and yet I'm still going to be forced to buy this because it has 6 games featuring Michael Jordan, including 5-27-89 game 3 where he scores 46-17 in the 4th and the game-winning bank shot over a helpless, inkless Dennis Rodman. Also, 6-2-89 game 6, one of Jordan's most famous moves: he steals the ball, saves it inbounds, gets it back and does a hanging, back-to-the-basket layup with a foul from Laimbeer. Could be worse, I could be forced to buy the box set for one game instead of six."
1,Kit was dried out - not worth the money - didn't work either,"It might say #1 trusted brand, however it was anything but. The kit was dried out when I received it and was really only worth MAYBE $0.25 (if that!) It only included 2 small test strips and the other materials were dried out and seemed old. I am extremely disappointed. I've used LEAD test kits before, but I've never seen anything as poor of quality as this. And the worst part is that this isn't really a product you can return... it obviously didn't work, but if you use the strips, then what is there to return? It isn't worth the time or shipping costs to send it back! I wish I could get my money back on this because this was the biggest waste of $10 I have ever spent on Amazon.Typically, I trust Amazon for quality, but this failed in quality in a major way."
4,Worked great easy to use!,This product was easy to use and worked great. I found out in minutes where the lead in my house was.
3,Only 2 test swabs!,"The product seemed to work fine for the price; I didn't get a positive result for anything, but that doesn't mean it wasn't working. It shipped fast, I think it got here 2 days later. The only problem is there was only 2 test swabs in the kit and it said there were 6 on the package."
1,Danger!,These two small pieces are sufficient for two tests. No way is there six.The first one shredded.The second came up negative for lead paint. I am ordering another brand.I am working in a hundred year old house with many layers of paint. Thebuilding inspector told me to assume there is lead paint. This kit is junk.
1,IT WAS A DUD!!!,Wasn't worth a dam!! RETURNEDIT FOR A FULL REFUND!! That part was good!! Item itself wasn't worth a plug nickle!! Should be taken off market.
1,This kit DOESN'T work!,"We are very concerned that the paint dust created by our back neighbor's painter, might have lead. We decided to purchase this kit to test our soil, since we have an organic veggie garden in our backyard. We followed the instructions to the T. Even called the 800 number. The paper doesn't turn ""orange"" like they say, when it's ""ready"" to begin the test and they confirmed that on the phone. They said it's a barely visible orange-ish blush. OMG!!!! I have been a Color Stylist for multiple Studios, such as Disney, Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network to namedrop a few, and I KNOW color. There was hardly a color shift! I even tried testing one of our lead crystal glasses. The box said 40% PbO. The strip gave NO reaction!!! If I could give it a ZERO star I would!"
1,Not a guide,'Stocking stuffer' size book with brief overview of champagne in general. Not in depth. Not a guide.
4,good,"Compare to some other books on case studies, this book has less cases than others. However, it gives more details and explains by different forensic methods. It helped me a lot with my forensic-case-study paper."
4,methods of forensic detection,loved this book.it got right into detail about everything you can think of when it comes to crime scenes.happy to add it to my collection
5,Got it for a class,Needed and this place usually has the books that I need. Even better it comes quickly and most products are in great condition. Was a good read and will be a keeper for understanding crime scene analysis.
4,Sharp Grill and Nice Quality,It took longer to remove the plastic rap and the glue than it took to install the grill.The grill looks awsome and changes the look of the truck in a good way.The hole down clamps could have been designed a little better because they should of had two tabs on them so the pressure would be more equally displaced.Don't bother tring to register the grill because there isn't an on line site so i called Putco and they said to hold on to the reciept and if there is a concern then call them first and get a return number and send it back to see if they will warranty it.Over all i am pleased withe the product and the price i paid but the information to register the product was misleading.By the way the grill came in super fast way ahead of time!
2,It's too expensive,"I did not have chance to use it yet, but I feel it is too expensive. $12.99 for one small piece I hope it can last long."
5,A great story...,"...about a great league! The cradle of basketball creativity, and the original Showtime! The NBA held the economic advantage, thanks to larger markets, but the ABA had the better product. The infusion of ABA talent and technique revived the NBA game in the late 1970s. In the first NBA Finals post-merger, it was no accident that 5 of the 10 starting players were ABA alumni. Their story is told with humor and flair in this very enjoyable video."
3,Good product,"This product is a good one, but one word of caution- it will not work for a dry /chapped lip condition, only cold sores."
3,Standard Grace Livingston Hill novel,"I must say that I was expecting a very different story because I clicked ""LOOK INSIDE"" to read a few pages. The sample pages were so interesting to me, I ordered the book immediately. Unfortunately, the Amazon quick view has ""The Best Man"" by Harold McGrath, which is a very different story. I didn't notice until after I received the book. Be careful! Grace Livingston Hill's ""The Best Man"" incorporates some of her usual plot devices: mistaken identity, good versus evil, train travel, love at first sight, a wealthy & beautiful young heiress, greed, blackmail, nature scenes, etc. Once you suspend your disbelief during the wedding scene, I think you will enjoy it. This book also does not overtly mention God or Christianity, it only alludes to certain Bible verses. I read elsewhere that GLH did that in some of her stories, which was a bit disappointing to me. She does have exciting chase scenes in this book. If you are a fan of GLH, you will probably enjoy this story."
4,Pity if it really is presented at 1.33:1,"A fun sequel to ""Snow"" it actually reunites all the major characters from the first film and is great holiday viewing. Tom Cavanagh is charming as always (sort of as if ""Ed"" were Santa) and it's wonderful to see Ashley Williams again.However, it's a pity if it's really 1:33.1 as described as it aired on ABC Family not only in 1.78:1 but also in HD; it would be a shame if DVD viewers get the sides of the frame chopped off."
2,It's a movie of boring standards.,"My wife is the one that wanted it, I wanted nothing to do with it, other than that, it was something to watch when nothing else was worth watching."
3,Not as good as the first one,"LikeSnow,Snow 2: Brain Freezeis a cute Christmas movie. Unfortunately, it doesn't quite recapture the magic of the first. Santa, a.k.a. Nick Snowden (Tom Cavanagh) loses his memory. This takes some of the charm and goofiness from his original character. Also, there are a few other changes for the worse. Hector, the wisecracking sidekick is MIA in this film. Also, Sandy changed her hair color, which was just odd (I thought she looked better blond).Snow 2: Brain Freezereally only takes off late into the film. It gets better near the end, but by then it's too late. It's still decent, but fans ofSnoware likely to be a bit disappointed."
4,Better than most.,"I was looking for a product to get my children started on learning German. They have had a little instruction in the past, but not enough consistency. They are 6 and 8 years old. This DVD captured their attention and my older boy was excited about the interactive games. They both liked the songs and even tried to sing along. Overall it was a positive experience and I think they will watch it again on thier own. On the down side, it is a little short on content and adults won't be overly impressed with some of the child acting...but it's fine for what we wanted. I have not tried the Muzzy DVDs so I can not compare it to them, but this product is better than many I have seen."
3,interesting video scenes,"I bought this for my 7 and 2 year old children as a supplement after finishing the German for Children CD series. This video covers all of the same ground (eerily so: does everyone learn their German colors from a balloon seller?). While my children loved the ""home movies"" of Sebastian and his friends at a birthday party, the quiz portion is tedious after you've done it once, and the songs on this dvd are not nearly as catchy as those on the German for Children CD. There's also a lot of cheesy low budget animation. Go with the CDs series."
1,Not a Learning Video,"Poor sound quality. We could not understand the speaking, because the German was spoken by natives, at normal speed - and spoken by children to boot. All of us tend to mumble in our native tongue. Definitely a lot of mumbled, slurred words and phrases. Not a chance in the world we were going to pick up one word with confidence."
2,Basic - gets annoying,"Trying to learn German? Go with something else. It did help us remember colors and give us some basic words, but it really goes too quickly to be of much use and the music gets obnoxious quick. My daughter didn't learn much of anything from this, as she just couldn't keep up- she's four. Might be better suited for older children in 4-7th grade, but is really cheesy for kids too much older."
3,Okay,"My daughter wanted to learn German, so I bought this program for her. She's nine and loves dogs. She was bored with the program and thought it was for babies. She wanted a more rigorous program and basically refused to have anything more to do with this one. I thought it was okay myself--colorful, cute dog, nice kid, etc. I think she would have learned quite a bit with it, but she was more interested in grammar than conversation. (Strange child, I know.) I would recommend it for another child, especially younger or less sophisticated."
4,classic and versatile,You can't go wrong with the white skimmer in summer - fortunately the leather is soft. I'd recommend buying half a size bigger than what you normally wear.
5,Most comfortable shoes I own!,I LOVE these shoes...I have been searching for the right ballet/audrey hepburn style flats for years. I also love the price!
4,i love flats,i absolutely love these shoesthey are super cute and look good with basically everythingthe only sad part for me is that ive got fairly long toes (as my boyfriend tells me) so the tips arent at a perfect point because the shoe has formed on the side to my toes
3,"For ladies with narrow feet, plz!",I have relatively wide feet and these shoes run narrow...so for the ladies whose feet aren't petite...stay away!...aside from that though the shoes are comfy and its made of quality leather...yet another shoe that makes me envy the girls with small feet...
4,Wrong Size...,"Looked really nice, a little long, and I ordered a size or half-size too big. Metallic gold very pretty color."
5,Hepburn rules!,"I have two pairs of these. They are extremely comfortable, look great on my feet, and the price is right. Quality seems a bit flimsy and they may not hold up for long, but who cares? I may buy a pair in every color I can find."
3,meh,"i cannot claim enthusiasm for this shoe. if i had not worn them on concrete and by doing so marking the soles, i would have returned them. they are very flimsily made; the leather created creases around my toes as soon as i first put them on. they seem very pointy on, and there is also toe cleavage, which is not to my liking.i bought these with the idea to wear with my wedding dress. i have found another pair that suits much better."
3,good...but not good enough,I don't have access to the box of Horchata I can get in California. So I have to settle for this. It's good but not like what I get in the box. It has an after taste.
4,Close to being home made,"Pretty good product, especially for being a concentrate. A friend had brought into work some home made horchata using his families recipe and let me try it. I tested our friendship by drinking most of it. That was the first time I had tried horchata. Well I had been hooked and wanted to get some for home. I ordered 2 bottles of this concentrate. The first bottle I used water, the second 1% milk. I definitely recommend using milk. It was very close to being home made. Needs to be stirred every time before pouring. But the taste was there. Shipping was quick. Slightly pricey. Will order again when I need a fix."
1,Not what I payed for !,This was a rip off . In stead of all 6 figures I only got 2 ! DO not buy this1
1,Booooooooring,"In Voyage of the Frog, David Alspeth, a fourteen year old boy sets sail on the Frog intending only to fulfill his Uncle's last wish,to dump his ashes far out into the deep sea, a place he has long pleasured. Unfortunately a savage storm unexpectedly slams into the tiny sailboat. David goes through some adventures trying to survive and get home. The first one is when he gets hit by an oil tanker. Also he experiences starvation forcing himself not to eat. Finally when he is found he refuses to go because he fears leaving the Frog behind.I would never recommend this book. Although there were some good parts in this book such as when a shark attacked his boat and when he was knocked unconcious, I feel it still needs more action. Also there needs to be quite a bit more humor to it. In my opinion this book is very dull and you should not read it."
2,A WASTE OF MY TIME,"I recently read The Voyage of the Frog. The story is about a boy named David Alspeth who is told by his uncle to drop his remains in the Ocean where land was not seen. After this short task a huge storm hit and David hit his head causing him to lay in a pool of bood. He then realized if he was going to save the himself he would have to save the Frog first. The night of cleaning the boat he was starving and had an encounter with an oil tanker. After starving and thirst, he found himself after a smaller storm in the Bay of Whales. The funniest thing was one of the whales popped up and shot snot in David's hair. Seeing a ship he had an opportunity to leave the Frog and get home. He refused to go, and just took some supplies and went on his own.I did not like this book because it was boring. It also did not have any humor, except for the whale snot. It also had no action. This book was a waste of my time. I loathed it. I think it was obtuse."
2,A numerous amount of downsides,I recently read The Voyage of the Frog. The book starts by David having to scatter his uncle's ashes in the sea. He is soon hit by a huge storm. He hits his head and becomes unconscious. He survived many other things such as a shark and a near collision with an oil tanker.The book had numerous downsides. I wasted much time reading it. The only part I liked was when he got whale snot in his hair. I was disappointed with Gary Paulson because I've enjoyed many of his other books. The only reason I read this book was to fall asleep.
2,Quite Dull,"This book is about David Alspeth who is 14 years old. He went out in the Frog to fulfill his uncle's wish to have his ashes scattered on the ocean. After David was done, a horrible storm came. David goes through many adventures to get home. He first when the Frog is almost hit by an oil tanker. He also must deal with the struggle to survive with very little food and water. When he is finally found, he refuses to give up the Frog. Instead, he decided to sail home by himself. I really found this book dull. If it was humorous I probabley would have liked it better. Also if the action wasn't in clumps. If I think of books to recommend to my friends, I would definetley not because it is dull."
3,This takes you on a scary but unforgettible ride.,I like this book it was almost like I could watch evrey thing in this book in my head like I was watching a movie and I wanted to know what happend. The chapters are small to that means this is a good book to read if you dont have much time but you want to get some reading in. In a week you will prabally be able to finish this book.
4,This is a must read book for the sea-lovers.,"This was a very interesting book and it had more action then I anticipated. This story is about a fourteen-year old boy who grants his uncle Owen his dying wish. When Owen dies David was left his boat. When trying to spread the ashes of Owen, David gets a taste of mother nature. David is stranded with little food and little water in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. After many close calls with everything from sharks to killer whales, David is given food and water from a research ship. He then starts on his journey back up the coast. I would recommend this book to teens who enjoy survival stories and action filled books."
2,"If you don't like the sea, you won't like this!","The Voyage Of The Frog is about a 14-year old boy who is told by his uncle the day he died to take his boat, the Frog out to sea and sprinkle his ashes in the wide, blue ocean. David goes out in the Frog, and sails out where nobody can see him, then gives the sea his beloved Uncle Owen's ashes. When coming back, he encounters storms, and sharks that turn him around, and back out even farther to sea. After being so hungry, he finds land, but realizes there is no sign of civilization. He sails back out hoping to find someone, and runs into a whale research team. Then, he begins the long journey home.The Voyoge Of The Frog is a two-star book. I thought it was very boring. When there were exciting parts, he almost described them too much. There were also some disgusting chapters. If you are not into the sea, you probably will not enjoy this book, or understand much of it. That is why I rate The Voyage Of The Frog with two stars."
2,The Voyage of the Toad,"The Voyage of the Frog was about a boy named Divid trying to survive. David dumps his uncle's ashes in the ocean, but while doing this he hits a storm. The storm takes him to the middle of the Pacific Ocean. In between the begining and middle of the storm, David hits his head and gets a concussion. A few nights later, David woke up to a shark bumping the boat. The next week a tanker went by, but does not see him. The wind picks up. He finds land. When he awoke from his sleep there's whale junk on him. Then,atlast some whale watchers find him. At the end David is going to travel home.This book was a very sluggish book. I think it was a dull book because it had no humor, excitment, or action. David just woke up, drank four cups of water, looked at the ocean, or cleaned, and then went to bed. The action was very little and had no excitement at all. Plus, I didn't like the part about David reading Owen's diary. I would not reccomend this book."
1,Boooooooring!!!,"The book The Voyage of the Frog is about a boy who goes out to sea to scatter his uncle's ashes. Then a storm hits and drives him far out to sea. Then he is becalmed and many things happen to him. First while he is drifting an oil tanker almost collides with him, and then he is attacked by a shark. Finally he is blown down the by the coast and a whale research ship finds him and offers to take him home. He refuses because if he were to go with them he would have to leave the Frog behind. So then he starts to sail home and the book ends. I thought this book had some action but mostly he just sat around on his boat. I also thought the ending was to sudden. I would not recommend this book to anybody because nothing ever happens and he just sits and feels sorry for himself. This book was dull and boring."
3,A Big Scary Story,"I like the book, but it's not the book I'm looking for. I'm not looking for sailing books. The writer will want you to read it by the way he ends the chapters and the book."
3,Not enough action,"It was an OK book, but at times there was nothing really going on.Read it if you want but the Book of Three is alot better!"
2,A book about a boy who is put against the forces of nature.,I thought that this was a bad book. The reason was because of the books abrupt ending and how it is almost the same of Paulsens other books. The only reason I didn't give it Zero stars or one was because other than the ending this was an average book. Although it was the ending that was the biggest flaw that made me not like it very much. Although if you like Pualsens adventure books and dont care about the ending then this is the book for you.
2,The Voyage of the Frog in my view,"To me The Voyage of the Frog is not a very good book, I would not like to recommend it to anyone. I wouldnt even recommend it to the author himself, Gary Paulsen. For all of those who do read the book, you must be some person that is extremely obsessed with boats. You could also be one of those people that just has to read every book that they can find. I didn't like it, because I dont understand how a fourteen year-old is able to live on water for like two weeks with seven cans of canned goods, no radio, and no clue of where he is. I also didn't understand all the fancy talk about the boat gears and gadgets. This book is a good book for the sailor or fisherman in all of us. Some will like this book and some will not, but I surely didn't. I say good luck to all of you who try to read it."
2,very boring book,The voyage of the Frog was detaled book. It was very detaled about the whales and the boat he was in and how he got it. It was hard to understand and it didn't started from that book because it started at how he got the boat.
1,The Voyage of the Frog,"The book I read is The Voyage of the Frog. The author is Gary Paulsen. This book is a fiction story. The plot is a 14 year-old boy, David Alspeth, set sail to his Uncle's boat, THe Frog. But when a massive storm throws the tiny boat all over the place, David is stranded. Little water, low supply of canned food, no radio, and no wind. The storm is only one of the many problems he must face. I recemend this book to the ages from 10-14. I really liked it because it was about boating and I love to boat. It was also about adventure, anybody who likes adventure should like this book."
3,Hazard,I remember hearing it and watching the video when I was 6 or so... And it's still haunting. Probably his best song.
1,I thought he had a good voice.,"I put this CD on and his voice sounds terrible. He is screaming and I can't keep it in the player. Listen to his next CD, notice his voice is back in control.Richard's voice breaks up too much for me."
3,Too much hard rock---not like Richard!!!!,"RICHARD, RICHARD, RICHARD!!!! Are you out of your mind???? Or is it just a rebelious stage that you're going through!!!! Almost every song on this album is nothing but heavy head-banging rock that just drives me bonkers!!!! Please stick to the ballads and the soulful duets with Luther Vandross!!!! Yes, I will say that I do like some of your songs off this album such as ""Keep Coming Back"" and ""Hazard"". But the other songs I don't really care for! And while you're at it! Get a haircut!!!"
1,WORST RICHARD ALBUM! DULL! BLAND!,"Out of all the great albums Richard Marx made, I don't like ""Rush Street."" While I liked ""Hazard,"" the rest of the album I didn't like. It had too many bland songs, too many faceless power ballads, the writing was limp on most cuts, and it just didn't rock enough for me. It just didn't match to the greatness of his '87 debut or the album after it. And his rival male competition, Bryan Adams, made a better album that same year in 1991 than his! Fortunately, he has proven to be a better artist long after this. I'd rather hear his other albums than face hearing these 71 minutes of crap!"
3,"A Couple Favorites, But It Hasn't Grown On Me Yet","Although ""Rush Street"" isn't my favorite album, it does have some good songs on here, like my two favorites: #3 (""Keep Coming Back""), with Luther Vandross accompanying Marx at the end of the song, and #5 (""Hazard""), an eerie, melancholy track about a young man in Nebraska suspected of killing his girlfriend. The latter song is actually the main reason why I purchased ""Rush Street"". The remaining songs will probably take some time for me to get used to, but I'd still recommend this CD to Richard Marx fans, as well as pop/rock listeners."
5,Real good clutch disk,"I have used this product many times before, this disk is smooth and grips well. No chatter ever,would reccomend to any one that has 400 t0 600 HP aplications extremely durable under harsh conditions.Would recomend to anyone looking for quality."
3,Somewhat disapointing product,I just purchased this from Amazon. It takes a long time to heat the water in this device and you must wait about one minute after each minute of use in order for it to build up pressure. As a result of this it is time consuming to use. It did not clean built up mess in my oven. It did an excellent job on the tile in my bathroom. It did not do well on the soap scum on the shower door and I had to use windex and elboe grease afterwards. It creates a large mess in that it sprays debris all over the place. You must be prepared to clean up after your cleaning with this.
1,Beware Of Cap!,"This product is AWFUL! Do not leave the cap on when storing it after several months of non-use. The cap will rust and become impossible to remove. I even tried channel lock pliers and spray lubricant! I called Customer Service and they want me to ship it back to them and charge me a repair fee. After that, I am expected to pay to ship it BACK to me! Forget this product. Euro-Pro is euro-trash!"
1,Non-existent Customer Service,"This item was shipped without the manual (not from Amazon). Operation is NOT intuitive and a friend who was trying to help out was scalded. Unfortunately the Euro-Pro Company uses a call center that is apparently located in a third world country. In other words, unless you speak Hindi, forget it. After 6 months am still waiting for the manual. I hope someone here can help out."
2,"Worked like a steamer should, then broke","I've used several different steamers of varying cost, and I didn't find this one to be that much better, considering it's costs. So I figured it cost so much because it would last a long time.About 6 months and 10 cleans later, the heating unit broke. I never use the EP961 on full throttle, in fact, I at most use it at half power. 10 uses and the most expensive component goes out? I can't recommend this product."
2,Great machine short on longevity,"Its very sad that Euro-pro has made an excellent product that doesn't last and offers consumers limited options for repair. For the past two years I have used this machine to remove wallpaper, a calcimine ceiling and eggs pitched at my house on Halloween. It is has been amazing at cleaning the usual household objects and freshing clothing. I loved it so much I purchased a smaller version to keep at my parent's house and I have recommended it to at least 20 others.The internal gaskets must have failed and now the safety cap leaks steam and the machine makes frightening noises. I am just going to pitch it because it is dangerous and is too costly to repair.To paraphrase Ricky Riccardo ""Euro-pro you have some 'splaining to do."""
4,beautiful little earrings,people the ictures do not do these justice. if you think they look good on the internet wait until you see them in real life. the rose gold overlay is absolutly flawless and the tanzinte cz are full of fire! I absolutly reccomend purchasing from this company!
4,Alarm Watch,"The watch itself is very nice and all I expected. The alarm wasn't described well and I would like it better if I could set the alarm once and didn't have to set it every day since I use it to remind me of a task I need to do every day at the same time. Also,it would be better for me if the sound on the alarm were louder."
5,Great Value,"I highly reccomend this watch for any one looking for great bang for the buck. I think the gentleman was having trouble with the second hand moving, because the large second hand is for the stopwatch feature, and the small one is acutally for the clock. Great watch!!"
2,Seconds hand does not move,"Though the watch runs, the seconds hand does not move. I gave the watch as a birthday gift to my nephew, thinking he can read the instructions and figure out a way to move the seconds hand. But, that did not work. It was a bad idea to buy something like this online."
5,Easy style to follow. Great companion to the daily podcasts.,"James MacDonald is a relatively undiscovered treasure of good Bible teaching. I happened to hear James MacDonald on the radio by accident as I was passing through the range of a christian radio station on a trip. I found his website and subscribed to his daily podcasts. Now I have purchased three of his books. His style is biblical, easy to follow, sometimes entertaining, but always practical. ""When Life is Hard"" was a book that speaks directly to a christian's struggles with life. ""10 choices that will change your life"" are great messages to keep you on track in your spiritual journey of following Christ. This book is a good biblical reminder of responsibilities and best practices that will fix a family or keep one working well. James is a Bible teacher, not a psychologist, which means you are getting God's advice, not just good advice."
3,okie dokie,This is really really good if you have trouble sleeping. I used to and had to take sleeping pills because I had trouble falling asleep. I bought these because I have BPD and wanted to be happier and increase my serotonin but it didn't do that :(
2,may work for some,"I had heard so much about L-Tryptophan, but could not find it for years. One of my friends told me about Source Naturals. I purchased a couple of bottles, varied the doses, but never slept through the night. I won't be buying any more."
1,Tryptophan 500 mg.,"I DID NOT THINK THESE PILLS HELPED AT ALL, THOUGH OTHER BRANDS SEEMED TO. PILLS ARE ALSO HUGE, AND DOSAGE IS 3 CAPSULES.WOULD NOT RECOMMEND."
1,Waste of my $$,"This product may work for others, but since I've been taking it for about 2 weeks, my anxiety levels have gone over the top and even my blood pressure is higher. I'm sure the L-Tryptophan hasn't caused my pressure to rise, but anxiety can do that; and I've been experiencing very high anxiety since using this product. I stopped it. Scary..."
1,unaffected by this product,"Bought from Amazon, I had high hopes for this product after seeking it for many years. Sorry to say though it had unnoticeable or no effect at all."
2,I don't know,I don't know if it was just me but when I took this before bed I had terrible nightmares. The nightmares disappeared when I quit taking them so I don't know what to tell anyone. except good luck.
1,Not worthy,It did not do anything for me. It made me numb and spacey. The effect was negative. I am going to cancel monthy purchase.
4,Does help with sleep,I have a very hard time falling asleep but after using this product on some nights I got the best sleep I have had in a long time. It does not work for me on some nights but most nights it does work and I try not to take it every night so that it doesn't lose its effectiveness.
1,makes me way too spacey,"I would not recommend this product. It makes me way too spacey. I much prefer Thorne L-Tryptophan. The effects are very subtle. I barely notice anything, but when I run out I really notice a difference."
4,Great for sleep aid.,"I pair this up with 0.3mg melatonin, because melatonin alone won't give me a fully enjoyable sleep. With tryptophan, you enjoy a full 8 hours sleep and more. I also notice less dreaming with this. For those with mood problems, it seems to have some effect. On the next day, I felt a little more elevated. I could be wrong because everywhere I read, it should gives more of a calming effect.Dosage = 3pills, 1.5g taken approximately 2 hours after last meal of the day. Together with or followed by 0.3mg melatonin."
1,Sad this didn't work for me,Made no difference to my hapless sleep pattern - I had high hopes after reading the reviews but found it didn't work for me - my husband and I shared the bottle and he sweetly suggested it 'might' have made a difference.
3,Side effects,"I started this supplement hoping that it would relieve my anxiety problems. But it made me too groggy in the morning, for several days. I had to discontinue the product for side effects. It slowed me down too much. could not obtain benefits from this supp."
3,Made me sleep but I turned into a depressed zombie,I'm perimenopausal and am having a awful time falling to sleep and if I awake during the night It takes me forever to get back to sleep. I needed something and I want something natural.It worked like a charm on getting me to sleep but after a week my husband noticed I seemed really tired and depressed. I couldn't decide if it was this or maybe just my hormones. lolAnyway he suggested I stop taking it to see what would happen. Well within one day I felt like a cloud had been lifted and I had some energy back. (?)I was taking 250 at bedtime. Wondering if cutting back more would help. I'm bummed because it really did help me alot to sleep but I just don't want to wake up feeling like I'm in a fog and sad.I sure would recommend to give it a try.
5,Anxiety? Insomnia?,"Man- I have got to say, HANDS DOWN, this is the ONLY natural ""medicinal"" remedy that has ever worked for me. 1-pill for anxiety & 3-pills to sleep. I never built a tolerance either. FIVE STARS!"
3,Didn't notice results,"I guess this product affects individuals differently. After trying it several times, I was unable to notice any effect. It did not make me feel sleepier or change anything regarding sleeping patterns. I couldn't identify anything as a result of trying these pills."
4,L-Tryptophan,This is a wonder product.It is shipped quickly and arrives in good condition.The product does just exactly what it claims to do.I am very happy with product and will continue to order from this provider site.
3,L-Tryptophan,"I have a hard time taking pills. I did use it, but, honestly, I really didn't see any differance. But, that's just me."
2,Didn't work for me,"Got no effect out of this. Waste of money in then end, but worth a try and better than getting hooked on something like ambien or xanax"
3,Not sure if it worked.,I think it made be fall asleep but will still take awhile 4 hours before I fell asleep. It also did not keep me asleep. I will keep these on hand because I think it will be safer to take this instead of medication.
5,This stuff really works!,"I always take this if i am having trouble sleeping.. i take 2 and wait about 30 min or so and just like that..im in a deep sleep. I don't know why but it seems to give me very vivid dreams, however when i wake up i feel very well rested. I highly recommend this for a sleep aid."
2,nothing great,"I was really looking forward to getting the record bowl. It was only so-so. It doesn't really seem like a record, and I never heard of the artist.It seemed kind of cheap."
5,The Best Macaroni and Cheese Recipe Ever,"I received this book as a Christmas present and was surprised to find that I actually enjoyed reading it. Not just trolling for recipes, but READING it! So much good information and so many recipes that range from simple to complex. There is something for everyone in this book. I also love the variations that Bittman lists--you can tweak a recipe according to your mood or taste. The macaroni and cheese recipe has become part of our holiday tradition; it's gone within ten minutes! I definitely recommend this book."
5,Excellent for the non-cook!,"I thought I was a total loser in the kitchen before somebody gave me this cookbook as a gift. The recipes are really easy to follow and so far have been absolutely delicious. I'm not a total loser now, and can happily cook some incredible poached eggs and pork loin dishes.If you're a lousy cook like I am, then give this book a try and see if it can help you improve your kitchen experience."
3,Shame about the binding,"This is a wonderful cookbook. I love the tone, the clear instructions, the many variations for recipes. I think it's the best general purpose cookbook since Joy of Cooking (in fact I've started using some Bittman recipes in place of old Joy favorites because they're easier and more flexible). HOWEVER, the publishing company really did this excellent book a disservice when they put it in such a cruddy binding. After about a year of normal use, my copy is falling to pieces -- another reviewer has noted the same, so it's not just a fluke. If the publisher would rectify this situation or release a new and improved version, I'd be happy to give this book 5 stars."
5,"I'm a not a Cook, but these come out great!","TONS of recipes, truly of every variety, and many of them are very very simple. I'm a baker, but not a cook, and this book is perfect because he explains everything. I absolutely recommend this to everyone who needs to start or add to a cookbook collection. A great 'moving out on their own' present as well."
5,Fantastic!,This book is a great idea for people like me that want a family in the future and don't want them to dread 'mom's cooking' all the time. It's great for people who are just starting out and a great mind refresher for the mature chef out there.
2,"If you have other cookbooks you like, don't buy this one.","I got this as a gift, and it is an okay book. I've looked up some misc. things like how to cook barley or good proportions for a milkshake, but generally the recipes are overly simplistic, for boring, middle-American food. The author's style also tends to overpower the recipes (his constant advice to eat leftovers and freeze 5 extra lbs. of stuff really bugged me and my tiny apartment freezer). This book is just not written for the sophisticated or simply urban cook or diner."
3,The book does not meet my needs.,Last year it was the New Joy of Cooking and this year How To Cook ... My problem was the same with both books -- don't have a recipe that calls for a sauce that is made on page 924. When you list variations don't write it like prose -- it is a cookbook not a novel. The book is too large with too many strange ingredients for me.
2,Only If You Already Know How to Cook Everything,"We purchased this book and tried to several of the recipes. He follows handbooks, cookbooks and the like to a T. I know how to cook pretty well. This title is misleading; it seems it would be great for a beginner or anybody that would like to incorporate more into their repertoire, but really, if you don't know to fix mistakes in the recipes like how to fix pancake batter so they don't come out like hockey pucks , this book may make cooking seem harder than it really is. The taste of everything was just ok, nothing spectacular. Buy if you want to see someone's take on some of your faves (and then be prepared to alter the recipe), but if you are looking for something that will introduce you to mind blowing meals, this is not the book for you."
2,The CD doesn't work with Macintoshes,Nowhere in the review or dust jacket of this book does it reveal that the CD-ROM of this book is for Windows machines only. It does not run on Apple or MacOS systems. Really crummy.
2,Rarely find what I'm looking for . . .,"I get so frustrated with this book. Each time I have a whim to prepare something (usually something straightforward) I reach for this book. Granted my is a few years old and perhaps has improved. Today I wanted to make artichoke dip. When I reached for it and could not find anything it was the last straw and I decided to go write a quick review. I can't tell you how many times this has happened.The book is filled with a ton of basic information, but on the recipe side I think it is very lacking."
2,Not So Good,"I was enthusiastic about this book when I first scanned it at the bookstore. Later, after trying a few recipes and spending more time with it, I found it to be mediocre."
2,Recipes need changing!,"The person who wrote this cookbook obviously likes everything fatty and unsweetened. I found this cookbook useful only if I changed just about all the recipes by reducing the fat content by half, and doubling the amount of sugar.My daughter didn't know this and baked some cookies using the original recipe in the book. They were disgusting! They weren't at all sweet and extremely fatty. Yuck!I use the corn bread recipe all the time, it's excellent if you know what needs to be changed. Do not add any butter at all (the recipe tells you to add 2 tablespoons), and add 3/4 cup of sugar (the recipe tells you to use only 1 tablespoon)."
4,Great Cookbook with a Lousy Binding,"The topics in this book are well organized and really do seem to cover almost everything. Each section has a nice intro with some background information and general strategy. The recipes come with many variations. Everything that I have made (about 30 items) has come out well and I've repeated several of them.The recipes are very clear and obviously designed for the normal limitations of an amateur or even serious amateur in a home kitchen.My only complaint is that a book called ""How to Cook Everything"" should be built to last, and the pages are falling out of mine. It's well written, but not well constructed."
5,An Inspiration To Cook.... Everything!,"Bittman's book is an inspiration to cook… everything! Its clean layout and step-by step instructions make it easy to find one’s place, mid-recipe, even while busy in the kitchen.Each section is prefaced with the concepts behind the recipes to follow. Even an amateur cook can adjust recipes without creating food-disasters.Recipes begin with a brief description by the author as well as any important preparation information a cook would need before her or she begins. It also notes the number of servings and average preparation time. Often following the instructions, Bittman will list a number of variation ideas to enhance the recipe. Although there are no end-result pictures, the pages are sprinkled with helpful diagrams.A detailed index and glossary follow the recipe section, as well as several pages on menu planning.Dishes turn out delicious every time. This is one complete cookbook no kitchen should be without. It would make an excellent gift...."
3,Good Basics...Recipes need help,"I purchased this book because I wanted to start cooking more. This book has a lot of the basics, reads well, and fairly easy recipes. The problem? I was extremely disappointed with the results. All of the dishes I made were ""average"". I haven't cooked anything that I would cook again. Good, but nothing great. I'm sure I will continue to use this book as reference, but I'm not looking for any new recipes, just a new cookbook."
3,Good basic tool,"It was an okay purchase. I can't pinpoint anything good or bad to say about it. I have heard a lot of great things about Mark Bittman, maybe my next purchase of his work will excite me more."
3,Heavy,I should have looked closer before purchasing! It is a tome for a paperback! Love Bittman so I'm happy to have him in my kitchen but should have a hard cover investment!
4,great cookbook!!,"great cookbook- but, description said book was new, however, all edges were slightly damaged :("
4,Great vegetables,"I've never been a veggie eater, because I didn't know what to do. This book has simple recipes that helped me overcome my problems."
5,This book actually tells you how to cook everything!,"As a beginning cook I constanly refer to this book to answer my questions. It is also a great reference if you have other cookbooks that may have instructions that aren't quite clear to you. The glossary in the back is great and it has many basic recipies for things that you may not find in other cookbooks. It is also very flexible and gives you room to add your own flair. I have quite a few cookbooks, and this one is definitely the most useful!"
5,An excellent kitchen reference,"I own several general cookbooks (as well as many more cuisine-specific ones) and this is my favorite so far. There are a few (especially the Culinary Arts Institute Encyclopedic Cookbook) which have meals which don't seem authentic, healthy, or well described. I can unwaveringly recommend this book as a general reference for experienced cooks (for instance, trying to remember how to cook acorn squash) as well as people just buying their first pan. The recipes are well thought out, described, and the book is very user friendly. The recipes may not all have the exact flavor I associate with each dish, but all have been good so far. Other good just starting out cookbooks are the Better Homes and Gardens New Cookbook and the Betty Crocker Cookbook."
4,"Not everything, but pretty useful","This is the cookbook I use the most these days. The recipes are fairly contemporary and there is interesting background information on ingredients and the like. There are no color photographs, so it's not the sort of book you flip through to find something to cook. Rather, it's a good reference when you have an idea already what you want to make. The only really problem with the book is that the recipes were not completely checked for glitches and are not completely idiotproof. Sometimes steps are left out or vague language is used. I prefer ""chem lab"" level cookbooks that don't leave anything to doubt, with exact specifications--this book is a little loose sometimes. And occasionally an ingredient doesn't show up in the step-by-step recipe, making you guess when it should be added. However, for the most part this cookbook is quite good."
1,"There are other, better references out there if you know how to cook","I don't understand why this book gets such high marks from so many. The recipes don't work, for me or my family. We're cooks. We cook all the time. We bake, we cook, we decorate and we are capable of some pretty complicated, intricate stuff. But this book and its recipes...wow. Just doesn't work for us. At all. Ever. We've had it in the house and we've tried to like it. But the proportions are off, for the spices and the baking and just about everything. I can make pudding from scratch in my sleep. But if I try the recipes in this book, I end up with liquidy mess. Far better to try other classic cookbooks, at least for us."
4,fun to have,this book is descreptive and easy to understand (i'm not very good at cooking and any help is appreciated)however since i don't have a computer in my kichen and don't have a printer the cd still hasn't helped me out in improveing my skill.
2,Not impressed,"I've owned this cookbook for a couple of years now...while the recipes are not incorrect, I've found them to be very bland. I've found simpler and better tasting recipes on the back of food boxes and cans."
4,Not durable,"This book gets 4 stars from me instead of 5 because the binding is nothing short of pathetic. It lived in our house for less than a year before huge chunks of pages began to fall out. For a cookbook intended to reside in a kitchen, I find this lack of durability unacceptable.The publishers should have taken a cue from Good Housekeeping (my grandmother's copy from the 1930s is not missing pages). If I had known, I would have taken extra precautions to prevent the book from falling apart."
5,Great for Beginners and Experts Alike!,"As someone who is learning to cook only late in her life, I was apprehensive and embarrassed about asking simple basic questions of friends and family. Perceiving this, my parents gave me this cookbook, and voila! -- I can cook!With step-by-step instructions on everything from cookware, ingredients, buying, preapring, cooking, and serving, there's nothing this book can't handle. It provides recipes to prepare foods in the simplest ways, all the way up to complex gourmet dishes. And it covers every imaginable food -- if it isn't in here, I can't imagine where you'd find it.The language is straightforward and encouraging, with appropriate editorializing on the author's preferences, and the layout is clean and easy to read. I can't say enough good things about this cookbook -- it never leaves my kitchen counter."
5,The most useful gift I ever received,"This book is excellent. What can I say? It has introduced me to a whole new world of cooking -- allowing me to make dinner every night on a busy student schedule, yet without resorting to canned or boxed foods (his emphasis on pure ingredients has given me a whole new appreciation for things like real Parmesan cheese and extra-virgin olive oil). My favorite thing about it is that I hardly ever have to buy more than a couple of things to cook one of his recipes -- he relies on basic pantry staples, no weird ingredients to go out and search for. If you enjoy cooking but feel overwhelmed by the time and effort usually required, this book is for you. The food is fresh and delicious, yet easy to prepare. Miraculous."
5,Wonderful,"Finally!!--a reason to throw away my Joy of Cooking. Bittman's ""How to Cook Everything"" delivers what he promised. Fresh ingredients, recipes anyone can use and information needed without all those details that most of us will never need nor care about. This is the only cookbook I have in my vacation home. I love it."
5,I really like it,if you are a beginning cook there are a lot of simple recipes and techniques. The total number of recipes is great...every time I wonder if it has a recipe for something...it is in there...it is a great basic book for experienced cooks as well.
5,A Great Book for First Time Cooks,"I just graduated from college and this book is the one I refer to all the time-- Mark Bittman gives great advice on everything from how to choose knives to what kinds of oils are best used for what dishes. His advice is economical, in terms of both money and time. I highly recomend this book to anyone who is just starting out or wants access to a vast amount of recipies that can be made under 30/40 minutes using household staples."
5,This may be dumb but,"what sold me on this book is how he's included recipes even for the simplist things - like how to make popcorn from scratch. How many people under 35 know how to do that?I agree that the binding leaves much to be desired, though."
4,YUM!,"I wish everything truly was in here. My husband got an itch to try to cook some enchiladas and, unfortunately, this book didn't have such a thing in it.However, the recipes are great. If you are just getting into cooking, this a good start. Mark Bittman spends a HUGE amount of time explaining how to do everything from picking out veggies and fruits to cooking a whole chicken. There are useful diagrams and tips on changing around the recipes.This cookbook is truly the best I have so far,"
2,The most underseasoned recipes I ever made,"I bought this cookbook because I needed what looked like a general but slightly sophisticated cookbook to take with me to Armenia where we don't have a lot of selection in ingredients. I tried several recipes and they tasted like. . . nothing. The spaghetti bolognese sauce did not have garlic or a single herb or spice. I finally had to start putting things in it to give it SOME flavor. Compare this to the Basics cookbook recipe by the Silver Palate duo. His stir fry dishes are tasteless, too. This might be a good cookbook if one has not really attempted cooking before but it doesn't help someone who has some experience. (I don't really take umbrage with the title since it is a big thick cookbook.) The Silver Palate series or Gourmet or Bon Appetit magazines provide much more successful recipes. I'm curious if all those rave reviews came from people who just READ the cookbook rather than actually trying to make some of the recipes."
2,I really wanted to like this book...,"I really wanted to like this book, and I guess I do find it useful from an idea standpoint, but the truth is the food doesn't taste good. We've prepared between 10 to 15 recipes from this book and all of them disappointed. Contrast this with the less exciting but always tasty Joy of Cooking, and Joy wins every time. I wanted a sort of workhorse cookbook for everyday and I quickly realized this was not it. It went from lying open on the kitchen counter, to the bottom book on the kitchen cookbook stack (when I would thumb through it to get an idea for a dish) to being returned to the bookshelf and I'm afraid that's where it's going to stay. We had such high hopes, but thankfully, there's always our Joy of Cooking..."
5,a staple in my kitchen,"This book is great. It has recipes for virtually anything you might want to make, and many of them are very simple. I use this book all the time. I have dozens of cookbooks and this is one that I get a lot of use out of. I do love cookbooks with photos, which this one does not have, but it gets more mileage than any of my others."
5,I love this book,"I received this cookbook for Xmas last year and have been turning to it over and over again through the months since then. The recipes are consistently simple and fun but, most important of all, TASTY! As I just ate the last bite of the ""Cranberry Nut Bread"" (p. 246) that I made a couple days ago, I just HAD to sit down and leave a review to help some undecided cook that, YES, you should buy this one. I just ordered his 'How to Cook Everything Vegetarian' (my husband is one) and am looking forward to more top notch recipes. Thank you Mr. Bittman!"
1,must I be lectured?,"I find Bittman's tone overbearing, almost untenable. Must he constantly shake his finger at me, telling me what I have to freeze, or why I have to do things exactly his way? Perhaps some people who don't know how to cook ""everything"" will appreciate the fingerwagger's way to prepare and cook. ""Dice exactly according to instructions."" But if you know as much as a very little, you might be put off by someone who so obviously knows everything."
3,Call me crazy...who doesn't know how to cook basic veggies?,"I was anxiously anticipating the arrival of this cookbook in the mail, only to be disappointed when it finally did arrive. I found nearly all of the recipes in this cookbook to be WAY too simple! I wish that more people would have mentioned this in their reviews."
4,Great all-purpose book,"This is my first cookbook and it has proved very valuable when I have to fend for myself. It's filled with basic recipes, techniques, and general information for the person who may have never cooked before. Bittman has clear disdain for ""prepared"" foods and once you try making pancakes or mayonaise from scratch, you'll see why you don't need store-bought brands anymore."
2,SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR THE JOY OF COOKING,"If you are serious about cooking, this is not the book for you. Top restaurant chefs and good amateur cooks know that excellence in cooking is the result of ingredients, technique, and presentation. The recipes in this book are over-simplified, there are very few illustrations, and very little about technique and presentation. Several of my favorite (and common) recipes were not in this book (but were found later in my ""Joy of Cooking"").If you know how to cook, this book provides little of value. If you don't know how to cook, the ""Joy of Cooking"", and several other well-known cookbooks, will be of far greater value that this pretentiously titled tome. If you want to learn professional techniques try the cookbooks of Le Cordon Bleu school of France."
4,"Simple, Good Information","I love this book. It explains all sorts of things. Like where different cuts of meat come from. How to make different sauces. How different oils impact the taste of your food. Very few are the times I've been disappointed. I think his idea of sweet tends to be not that sweet, or rich. Like the basic butter cake that involves a whole lot of butter and ground almonds--incredible and simple. I find the cookie recipes to be so-so.Every meat dish I've made from here has been great. Sometimes I just read the book to learn about food. I think the level of the book is basic to medium, which is fine for me. And if you are a dessert lover, than get another book in addition to this one."
3,A Little Disappointing,"A better name for this book might be ""How To Cook Everything Mark Bittman's Way"". That's not to say that his way is all bad; however, as much as I enjoyed some of his guidance and instruction, I found myself a little annoyed by the ""my way or no way"" tone at times. A book such as this should cover all points of view on how to cook everything, not just the author's.This book is worth a look and is a very helpful reference book in many respects, but if you want a true non-biased ""How To Cook Everything"" book, then buy ""The Joy Of Cooking""."
4,"fabulous philosophy, so-so recipes","I read this book cover to cover, which I have never done with any other cookbook, and loved the author's approach to cooking. As a relative neophyte to cooking, I especially appreciated Mr. Bittman's emphasis on acquiring intuition about what things to put together and how to improvise. I would have given this book 5 stars except that the quality of the recipes is inferior to the quality of the prose. In all four of the recipes that I recently tried, the proportions for the ingredients were off and I had to figure out ways to rescue the dishes. I guess I learned a lot--it certainly taught me to improvise--but I would have liked the recipes to be better in this otherwise excellent book."
4,a good basic cookbook,"I have had this cookbook for a few years. There are quite a few recipes that I make out of it on a semi-regular basis: clam chowder, calzones, tempura, ravioli, spaghetti carbonara, lamb curry, etc. Sometimes the recipes turn out a little bland, I definitely have to modify them to my own tastes, but these are excellent basic recipes.The binding of this hardcover edition didn't stand up to regular use. We are not hard on our books at all, but large chunks of pages have started falling out."
2,The food's just not great,"I know I am going to offend so many people who worship this guy, but I'm just not that impressed. I bought this book because I wanted to make delicious meals for my new hubby. I didn't know how to cook alot of things, but I know my way around the kitchen. I was very disappointed that out of 15 or so recipes, none had much taste. Maybe I am biased because I am from Texas and we like our food spicy - or at least flavorful - but I thought everything was too bland.Instead I recommend ""The Ultimate Southern Living Cookbook"". It does not claim to have nearly as many recipes, but the recipes it does have are flavorful and easy enough that novice chefs like myself can make a meal you'd be proud to serve to company or your beloved.Oh, in Bittman's credit, I think his recipes from his TV show are much better, probably because he is competing with world class chefs who inspire creativity and flavor."
4,"Great reference book, recipes are a little mundane","I use this book all the time, when I'm looking for simple recipes to cook ingredients I have on hand. The recipes are all good and consistent, but none are really great. It's good as a one-stop reference book, but nothing exceptional"
4,A good solid cookbook,"This is a good book. The recipes are easy to follow and prepare. The food is quite tasty. I agree with the reviewer who said the book falls apart with usage. Since this book is likely to be used a lot, the publisher should do a better job with the binding. Even with that problem, this is a book worth having since you will use it again and again."
5,the only cookbook you'll ever need,"This is the most complete, contemporary cookbook I've ever used. I don't get through a day without it. The perfect gift for a new couple."
5,This is the book I've been waiting for!,"FINALLY! Instead of the usual recipe collection with a few tips written in the margins, this is a genuine ""how to"" manual. Every recipe I have tried has been accurate, delicious, and most of all, non-threatening. I recommend this book to cooks and non-cooks alike."
4,"Excellent reference, refreshing attitude","Although more and more cookbooks attempt to convey a ""been there, here's how it's really done"" attitude about cooking, this one succeeds in many cases. It's offhand insights about technique and about choosing raw ingredients reduce anxiety when attempting new recipies and using new ingredients.The book seems to say ""nothing's a big deal."" It helps make true the saying, ""If you can read, you can cook."""
3,"Good, but disappointing in some basic ways.","While this is really an excellent basic book, it might better be titled ""How to Cook Everything: At Least, Everything You Might Want To Eat if You're a WASP or Yuppie Who Lives in The Northeast US and Don't Eat Much Spicy or Ethnic Food but Italian."". I was really jazzed by the reviews of this book, but found no recipies for: Vindaloo, pretty much anything mexican, anything but really basic chinese, and at that point I stopped looking. A good basic addition to your recipe sets, but hardly how to cook *everything*."
5,Gotta Have It!,"I have over a hundred cookbooks and this one is used more than any of the rest of them. I have had this book for five years, have referred to it again and again for new ways to cook old favorites and as a reference for everyday cooking. This is my favorite gift to give for a wedding shower."
5,BEST cookbook ever!,"Beats betty crocker's book even. I have about 30 cookbooks that I use and I use this one the most by far. it has literally everything, even recommended cooking times for turkey and other meats. a fabulous find!! :)"
5,Best Cookbook Ever!,"I used this book to cook a Thanksgiving dinner last year. Every recipe that I needed was in there, even the random appetizers I decided to make. I have been using this cookbook for all of my recipe needs ever since. I highly recommend it for all levels of chefs."
4,A Great Cooking Core Book,"I come from a restaurant family and am an avid collector of all types of cookbooks from vintage to Martha and I consistently grab Bittman's How to Cook Everything for how to ""cut to the chase."" His writing style is terrific for: explanations, definitions, useful tips and information, technique and recipes that I can't find in my vast collection of cook books. I must have in anyone's cookbook library."
4,Great basic cookbook,"I love this cookbook. Don't let the large size intimidate you, it's chock full of recipes that are simple and easy to follow but delicious. Since buying the book, I've tried about a recipe a day and they've all turned out successfully. It even covers the basics, from how to select and buy specific foods, to what you tools you should have in the kitchen. Very useful to all cooks, novice or otherwise."
1,No Pictures!,"While this looks like it might be comprehensive, there are no pictures and only a few illustrations. Considering that it is supposed to be a primer for new cooks, it appears to be less than helpful.A couple recipes look interesting, but a few obscure things that our family knows quite a bit about, would have been destroyed using the methods described here.It is going back...."
1,Not as good as Yan,"This book is about greed, lust, and unbridled enthusiasm. But Yan cooks it up better."
4,A big book with a pretty accurate title,"This book is really quite good at covering everything a beginning chef could want. It probably won't be the last cookbook you own, but it should probably be one of the first.Like many amateur cooks, I can manage a few decent meals, but tend to shy away from recipes that I have little experience in. This is really a shame, because cooking something new is almost always fun and a good learning experience, even if it doesn't turn out quite like you imagined.Armed with the great guidance of this tome, however, I feel confident in tackling just about any meal that sounds healthy and delicious.In addition to the great recipes, the authors tone and obvious love of food and cooking comes through on every page, inspiring you to make things you haven't made before.In short, this is a great, instructive book that will have a place in my kitchen for years to come."
3,It fell apart,"I really like this cookbook and use it as much as The Joy of Cooking. However, my ""Joy"" is holding up very well after about 25 years of use, ""How to Cook Everything"", which I have in hardback, started falling apart within the first year. And after about 3 years of use, it is basically just a bunch of loose pages stuffed into the book cover. This is not what you want in a cookbook. ""Boo"" to the publishers, IDG Books, for doing such a shoddy job with a good cookbook."
4,An In-depth look into two aspects of service,"I found this book to be very informative. It focuses primarily on two aspects of Victorian-age servant life: footmen and the laundry. The section on footmen is particularly useful, because it is very difficult to find any in-depth documentation of footmen's duties, working habits, everyday lives, etc. Ms. Sambrook covers this area very well, using the private diary of a footmen, as well as other expert sources.Additionally, she goes in-depth into the laundry facilities and procedures used in English country houses during the last century. Once again, its clear that Ms. Sambrook really did her homework when writing this book- she writes with expertise that is hard to find on this fascinating subject. I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did."
4,The innocence of heroism vs. the realities of life,"Standoff can be read both as a parody of virtue and as a philosophical look at multi-sided conflicts. Despite the fact that only one main location was used throughout the film, one hardly gets bored watching it thanks to the concrete and cunning narrative. It may not be a masterpiece of cinematography, but the kind of characterisation it depends on is one hard to find in today's cinema. Standoff is ""Reservoir Dogs"" meets ""Seven"" meets ""The Untouchables""; and what makes it different is that it underlines the inevitable dissapointments awaiting innocence and idealism while awaking a long-forgotten kind of heroism in the personality of a real-life Luke Skywalker."
5,Good product and GREAT customer service,"I got the version of this product for my iriver clix2. They worked great. Then it turned out the iriver clix2 was incompatible with the Windows version I had (XP Home Ed 2002 sp2). Bummer. When I called Gomadic to see if this charger would work with my new MP3, the man worked with me to figure out what I needed (kindly explaining AT MY LEVEL), THEN said he would send me the needed conversion tips FREE (AND the product was even past the warranty period). To me, ""it don't get any better than this""."
5,Well worth it,"My favorite essay in this thick, heavy, door-stopping book is a humble writing of G.K. Chesterton entitled ""A Piece of Chalk"". I absolutely adore drawing with chalk and so of course I felt connected to him right off the bat. It was actually the first time I'd ever read Chesterton before, and I instantly fell in love. There is something in his writing that resonates with something inside me... in other words, it feels good. This anthology also includes other masters, both classic and modern such as Didion, Seneca, among many, many others. Despite the size, it's very easy to read through and find your own favorites thanks to the table that sorts the essays by theme."
3,College book,The book was good it has a lot of highlighting and the edges are worn in making it look old. It has the story's I need so it works well
2,Easy to miss...,"I had to read most of the essays in this book for an English MA course. The best essays were the ancient ones. The moderns ones were often dry and dull, with the exception of George Orwell. His memories of his school days were like something out of a Charles Dickens novel, which was depressing and shameful, but rather interesting."
1,Lee Greenwood: Live dvd review,"I purchased this dvd specifically for the song ""God Bless the USA."" The dvd is set in a bar. The quality is not that good. The bar room setting takes away from the quality of the songs and music."
4,A fun read nothing more ... but what a fun read,"The River is a coming-of-age novel set in Bengal/India. The older sister is becoming interested in men; a particular man with adjustment problems is becoming interested in her. The younger brother is ""a kid"" with an interest in a cobra. The middle child can't quite figure out what's happening. The local color makes the story a delightful read and transforms the coming-of-age story into a stronger plot than many similar novels.This novel will not challenge your view of the world ... but it will give you a bit of thoughtful (not thought-provoking) fun."
2,Great Movie........terrible tape!,"There isn't much I can add to the great reviews which I am in total agreement with. Doris Day and James Cagney give stellar performances, the story of singer Ruth Etting is great, and the music is terrific. My major problem for the 2 stars rating is the horrible quality of the picture. Filmed in CinemaScope, the VHS tape wrongly presents the movie in a full frame format. The result is a movie that is distorted, fuzzy, and missing key scene elements. For example, in one scene James Cagney is yelling over a sitting Doris Day who is heard crying but not seen. In the proper widescreen format she would have been seen sitting on the lower right side of the screen. Update: This movie is scheduled for release on DVD on April 26, 2005. Hopefully all the aforementioned problems will be corrected. Stay tuned...The DVD was just released and it's FANTASTIC...5 STARS!!! Great picture and sound!!!!!! Yeah!!!!!"
5,A 1950s musical gem about the 1920s starring Doris Day.,"""Love Me Or Leave Me"" is a musical gem! It is a very polished and extremely entertaining film in which Doris Day plays 1920s singer Ruth Etting. James Cagney's fine performance of her gangster manager-husband and the vintage songs highlight the picture. It was made in CinemaScope and only by watching it in its original widescreen format can the film be fully appreciated."
3,Nice crime-musical,"MY RATING- 7.3This one is a curious mov made when James Cagney had already left his crime movs. It also stars the popular Doris Day as the singer who is sponsored by him.Cagney gets his crime movs touches to create a gangster who loves Doris Day in his way. In the end, she'll stay with Cameron Mitchell.I never liked too much Day, cause of her image too ""goodie goodie"" yet she proves to be a good actress here. She sings some fine songs like one of my faves-""Shakin the Blues Away""."
2,Curiously sterile,"Some years back, I read a bio of Ruth Etting, upon whose life ""Love Me or Leave Me"" is based. A big singer in the 1920s, Etting married her goonish manager, and when she wanted to leave this ill-advised marriage later, he shot though did not kill her new boyfriend. Now in the wake of stories like the OJ Simpson trial or the Dorothy Stratten murder of 1980, a viewer would be very tempted to see this movie, especially as it boasts two fine stars, Cagney and Day. But something is wrong with this movie. Day is not as appealing as she usually is, somehow much colder and yet not as smart as such a woman portrayed that way is. Frankly, I kind of understood Cagney's point of view much better, and that's not really supposed to happen. ""Love Me or Leave Me"" disappointed me--though I didn't leave it until it was completely over, I was very far from loving it."
4,Day at her best,"James Cagney gets the best of Days acting in this steamy story of Ruth Etting and her tribulations with Marty The Gimp( Cagney)Its in this film where Days solid dramatic acting actually augments her fine singing powers.At the AFI tribute to Cagney, Doris Day gives a fine tribute to Cagney..is there any doubt that this was her best role in films."" well ya gotta admit one thing the gal can sing..about that ..I was not wrong"" I think Cargney wanted "" City for Conquest"" (1940) to be a big success..it wasnt....""Love Me Or Leave Me"" may have done it for him."
4,Excelent Film,My wife and I really enjoyed this film. We selected it because Dorris Day said in an interview that it was her favorite film. Very nice um-expected twist at the end.
3,"""Love Me or Leave Me"" is a great movie!","I can't wait to see this movie on DVD. I first saw it about 15 years ago after taping it on TNT. This movie contains what I think is Doris Day's greatest performance---and what a shame she didn't get an Oscar nomination for it. This role showcases all of her talents and hints at the truly great acting ability she had and rarely had the opportunity to show. So many of her roles were lightweight. Nevertheless, she was one of the greats of her generation. I hope the Academy rewards her with an Honorary Oscar one of these days. If you're on the Board of Governors, think about it."
5,A Mozart veteran losing none of his prime - definitive live performances of late,"Buchbinder is a powerful and intelligent exponent of Mozart, and there's no one else more suitable to debunk the myth of Mozart as a roccoco figurine than this maestro.The maestro knows his Mozart ""inside-out"", evident through the effortless spontaneity in his playing, intricately and intimately captured on this very fine recording of superb quality.If you own other live recordings of Mozart's 20th, you must be sure to own this as well. I've not come across another recent live recording of the majestic 25th, and this is definitely a recording to own, not just in lieu of Buchbinder's faultless and definitive playing, but also of his own cadenzas that are dazzling and virtuosic, if not entirely complementary to the reserved classicism of the piece itself."
4,the earth moved for me too...,"gurge rocks my world, the happiest songs with the weirdest lyrics, would not live without it. the only minus must be that the songs could be a liitle longer, the cd finishes to soon! - very hard to get a hold of in denmark, though."
1,"Essentially This Is The ""Message From The Country"" Album But It's A Very Shrill sounding CD...","The mastering on this CD is very thin and shrill. There are other sources for these songs with much better sound. One Way Records released a CD of Message From The Country that has essentially the same track listing (except for a few songs) and sounds wonderful, very close to the original UK vinyl.The recent EMI remaster of Message from the Country has been heavily processed with digital hiss removal which makes the whole album sound smothered and muffled, similar to an MP3. There was also a lot of low end EQ added which cuts down on the clarity even more.I'd suggest seeking out this wonderful album but with the One Way Records CD."
4,the b sides are worth the buy,"strange currencies, from the cd monster, is a very good song. Some similarities with everybody hurts, some might say, but still a great tune. lets talk about the b sides, which are the ones that really matters to the people who already own the cd. three great live tracks, the first a very diferent version of drive, the gem of automatic for the people, here the song is much stronger and electric, the second one is a cover version of funtime, a relative short (2 minutes), but still very solid version. the cd closes with a hit from the first years, radio free europe, a clasic..."
4,Mills Ahead(excuse the pun),"One of the masters of the base returns with somthing special 4 all u techno lovers out there.Millsart,purpose maker or just Jeff what ever u wanna call him this C.D. is pure mills relentless base, the synth tickling your ears what more can u ask for.some might call it minimalist but there is so much to his work that u need to hear to undertstand. like an abstract painting its what u see in it yourself that counts>"
1,OLD BOTTLE,"I am a big fan of Lagerfeld. Imagine how disappointed and embarrassed I was this Christmas, when I gave this bottle as a gift. I don't know how long this particular bottle was sitting around on the shelves, but it is old, and stale. It stunk. I wasted a lot of money. I am still a Lagerfeld fan, just won't buy from here anymore."
3,No Mix And Match,Don't mix your memory and make sure is matches as pairing it up to something that is of the same may not be as compatible as it should because it's a different version or from a different manufacturer. I expanded the memory and it didn't work together...so get two or three or what if that is what is needed and they should work...right? Right.
1,PFB Vanish,I would not reccommend this product. The roll-a-ball dosn't function properly and to much of the product comes out at one time. It takes long to dry and has a smell! And last it dosn't stop bumps! Stick to Tend Skin!!
2,Does not work very well,I tried this product and I really don't think that it works. I tried it for a week and it did NOTHING.
2,Too Small Too Weak Two Stars,"I own a three year old Eureka Enviro Steamer that has gotten pretty worn and leaks water readily now, so I bought a big Euro-pro Steamer that I thought was way too loud for little jobs and just tried this Mini Steam Zapper today and give it two stars max.The Zapper weighs more than 5 pounds which feels rather heavy for its size when full of water, but the water capacity is less than 10 ounces or 300 ml. That amount of water lasted less than 30 minutes and the Zapper did not even finish cleaning two small round bathroom sinks.It is cute but ineffective, heavy, and just as noisy as the big steamer. Get the big steamer - it's replacing my old Enviro-steamer on the floors and does the little jobs better than this mini steamer. This mini steamer is not worth the price."
4,We loved it!,"It worked great for us. After it is heated, spray it over a sink to let some of the water out. It did spray water on clothes sometimes, but it doesn't effect the look of the clothes once dry or the effectiveness of taking out the wrinkles. I could steam one days worth of my husband's & my work clothes with out refilling. I bought this for my wedding dress & took it on my honeymoon. It is a little heavy but I got used to it. Works best going from top to bottom moving at a slow rate. The only problem we had was a house guest screwed the lid on wrong & stripped the groves. After using this we will not go back to ironing."
2,napoleon complex?,"This product did not clean my shower walls/glass windows as advertised. It started off doing a great job cleaning tile grout w/the small brush attachment, but, as in other reviews, the bristles melted/disappeared after scrubbing. Now the Zapper's not being made anymore & I can't replace it. Guess I'll have to go back to the toothbrush...Also, the amount of water you fill it with doesn't produce enough steam to do a decent sized job. I have to stop, let it cool for 5+ min., add water, plug it back in & let it reheat before continuing (for another 3 minutes!).I'd say it's a good product for a very, very small job."
2,No much of an assortment,"Just Received this item and there are only about 3 or 4 sizes in the package, the smallest being about 1/2 an inch. For most of my applications, this is too large. These won't go to waste, but I'll have to order something else in smaller sizes. Bottom line, it's not what I thought I'd be getting."
4,Give 'em an Inch?,"There is a lot of tubing - 40', and in a variety of sizes. However, the sizes indicated are a little misleading in reference to standard cylinder/pipe/tube sizing. I knew this would be thin wall, and aware of its shrink ratio, but I needed a one inch tubing. I figured I would just stock the rest for other projects. The 1"" and other sizes the description refers to is actually half of the circumference (pressed flat and measured across the width- it is not a 1"" diameter measurement, it is actually less than 7/8"" in diameter. So I did find some other tubing with a true as described 1"" diameter. Now I have a bit more to stock for another project. And chalk these up as knowledge learned. They do work properly and at a fair price at .30 a foot. Just be aware of the non-standard size if it is essential."
4,Interesting and underrated,"This is a pretty fascinating little film. The other reviewers have pretty much told the story , so I won't be repetitive on that.But what is really interesting is the portrayal of the Black characters. The film aviods rank stereotypes of the time and most of the Black characters are shown as decent, intellligent, and well-spoken (aside from the thuggish rioters, who are not the main characters). Similarly, it's also good that the film makes differences between the wild White rioters and the decent White characters who try to stop the madness. Overall, a very anti-racist film for it's time that deserves to be better known. Yeah, some of the dialogue and actiong are corny by modern standards, but it's still a good film that is really more about good vs. evil than Black vs, White."
5,a story to talk about,This movie is not only entertaining but very enjoying as well..the story line is well thought out and follows the script from beginning to end..The Well is a Hollywood classic I watched when I was a child. I purchsed this movie as one to share with my family and friends. The well is one movie in my opinion to be one of the best of the rest.
4,Same filter for less...,"Same replacement filter as Shark factory for less money. As with factory filter, it's a pain to clean it, but that's due to overall design and not a flaw with performance of the Euro-Pro product."
4,"works great, but expensive","My wife bought the shark euro-pro small vac a few years back, and always had trouble finding the hepa-filter. But with Amazon you can literally get everything! These filters work great in filtering dust and dirt, but they sure do get clogged quickly. An old toothbrush is needed to clean the filter, so you can re-use it multiple times. Sure wish these cost less than they do."
5,Wonderful; stays with you,"Around the internet, it seems much has been said about the found sound & almost mad carnival-esque nature of this record; how it was produced (personal home recordings over the course of several years), the identity of every friend-of-a-friend musician (Flying Saucer Attack, Movietone, etc) but one question I cannot find the answer to - Whatever happened to Debbie Parsons? She produced those mysterious sounds after all. Debbie are you still out there?"
4,Sparkling Example--Fantasy Slave Girl Training,"Solidly written with moderately believable scenes of punishment. Sex scenes are well written with eroticism included in the descriptives, unusually well done. There is a minimum of page wasting ""crack, scream"" monolog and a maximum of actually well written prose, focussing, of course, on the experience of Stephanie. The inclusion of the female ""owner"" of the operation is a useful plot theme which makes some of the rest even more realistic."
2,Borrrrrrrrrring,"This book has little to recommend it. The plot (what there is of it) is so boring that I barely got through the book. Stephanie so clearly enjoys being a sexual slave, that it doesn't seem like she's a slave at all. Also, the pain that she suffers comes through clearly, but not erotically. Unfortunately, the end is just as boring as the rest . . . . The only reason I give it 2 stars instead of 1 is that it is moderately well written."
3,Interesting,"I have never read a biography of Napoleon, so there was a lot of new information for me here. It's a good read if you are interested in this kind of thing."
3,Works,Don't know why the product always comes in a used bottle with the cap looking already open.This stuff has been used in my computers system for a few years now (i change it every 6 months)... and its been working decently in the loops.There currently is some white build-up taking place throughout the tubing. The tubing is suppose to never have problems (Tygon) and has been in system for many years. So I am going to just blame either the product or some dust got into the loop and has manifested some nasty infestation.Product works fine and I recommend it to anyone water-cooling their PC.
5,Great for liquid cooled machines,My rig needs coolant every 6months and this product does the trick. It was here quickly after ordering and help me avoid down time. If you have a liquid cooled ri you should give it a try.
5,My Jacket From Brazil,This is a great iteam. Especially since there were no others available during the world cup. This is great. An all around weather track jacket.
5,"As good as Chaucer, and probably one of his analogues.","A wonderful satirical look at late 12th century society with special emphasis on inter-monastic rivalries as well as the increasing influence of ""secular"" clerics. A must read for anyone interested in medieval Anglo-English satire."
4,Good Read,I found this book to be very enjoyable. It kept my interest and was nicely written.I am looking forward to more books from Bruce. I would recommend buying this book.
1,Good concept - really BAD writing!,"While I know that the FR novels are meant to entertain and not endure as legendary works of literature, I thought the writing in this book was very poor. Lines like ""Marrec felt he could feel the cold ..."" were very annoying and found throughout the book. The bad writing caused me to put this one aside. I often wondered if an editor spent any time at all on this novel.The concept overall was interesting and I will pick up future installments in the Priests series (the Rogues series was quite enjoyable). WotC seems to be looking for new authors for the FR line, but Bruce Cordell should stick to game design. If you must read this novel (I try to read every novel in the FR and DL lines), borrow a copy from a friend or the library."
2,Boring and unengaging,"This didn't feel like a Forgotten Realms adventure. It was hard to care about the characters, and the plot meandered. Not bad, as such, but just not very interesting."
5,BRUFORD'S RHYTHMIC TOUR DE FORCE,"Without question, Bill Bruford is the greatest drummer of his generation, with a creative thirst unmatched by any other working artist. This recording, visually as well as sonically, is a joy! The remarkable interplay among the musicians delivers a cross-polination of ideas that build to a veritable rhythmic tsunami. There is no rock-star preening or inane pounding. Instead you have subtlety, nuance, grace and daring at every turn. The melifluous streams flow Arican, Hispanic and European, pouring forth as this one irrepressible world rhythmic cadence. The essential instrument for dance has always been percussion and it is here in spades, obviously, with enough inspiration to have you discard any concern for a top melody line and dropping you right into the essence of a groove. This is a brilliant recording by any standard of measure. Considering it is from Bill Bruford, we should not be surprised!"
2,Ponderous and incorrect,"This ponderous, slow novel is not devoid of interest, if one likes his historical novels to resemble history essays, and biased ones at that. Carthaginians weren't innocents: they, too, fought for political and economical power, and the spotless heroes Durham made of them are ultimately unconvincing. They sacrificed babies to Moloch, though probably not on the scale Romans purported. The city of Tartessus in Spain was obliterated utterly by Carthaginians, as Carthage would be. But the error I can't countenance is the alleged Hamilcar's son Hanno Barca. Hamilcar's irreducible political rival at Carthage was Hanno the Great, and the two cordially hated each other. It is unconceivable, then, that Hamilcar would give to one of his sons the name of his hated rival! ""Hanno Barca"" makes as much sense as ""Catilina Cicero!"""
3,"A man, a woman and an elephant--a classic triangle","Hot and cold story telling of a fascinating historical figure, Hannibal of Carthage. Author brings in some very nice detail about the back biting and fragile alliances among the various participants in this story.For me, however, this book took a long time to get through because of the unnecessary time wasted on the tender side of Hannibal in his relationship with his wife.Book could have been 100 pages shorter and been much tighter. Hannibal's life after defeat by the Romans (hope I didn't spoil ending) is glossed over very quickly. Too much soap opera overshadows a great story."
1,"Bad history and bad substance. Writing's average, though","I knew from other reviewers that the history was flawed in this book. I also learned from reading it that the dialogue is sluggish and sloppy, with such english-centric and Phoenicianly incomprehensible puns like ""Watch your ass---your donkey, I mean"", and endless internal dialogue paragraphs in between lines of actual dialogue that SHOULD be happening in a fluid conversation.The story I gave up on twice, and had to force my way through, until I came to a point where I simply could not continue, and just read ahead to different points in the novel. The characters are so lifeless and one-dimensional, it's painful trying to care about them.There was no chemical reaction with this one; total bust."
2,A long haul,"While I wasn't as negative about this book as some critics, I do think it took a very dynamic time in history and rinsed all the excitement out of it. It seemed the novel lost any impetus after the battle of Cannae. Ross Leckie's Hannibal is about half the length and a much better read. Try that one first, gentle reader."
2,"wanted to like it, but...","i really wanted to like this. i'm a big fan of things roman and thought it would be great to read about the second punic war from the other side. but this book is about as dry as a text book, and far less informative. the characters are stiff, unrealistic, cardboard heros. others who recommend this talk about epic, sweeping battle scenes. uh... no.if you read this, not only will you have to slog through over 500 pages of awkward writing and ungainly characterization, but you will gain an innaccurate understanding of the events of this war. this book has little of what makes historical fiction worth while."
3,An average book for a great figure,"Overall, the book is o.k. The prose is generally good although there are times when Durham goes a bit overboard (it seems that everyone who slips or falls down is searching for ""purchase""). I agree with the reviewer how wrote that the book runs out of steam at the end. The battle of Zama is dispensed with in a few paragraphs (this, for the fall of mighty Hannibal?). The ending is abrupt. Hannibal looses Zama (sorry if that spoils the surprise for anyone who never took a history class) and then walks home to Carthage and sees his son. That's the end. That's it. Ugh!I would have given this book four stars (mainly because of my fondness for Hannibal) but the ending is weak and there are too many loose ends left unresolved for the reader."
3,Fair but not compelling`,"I love historical fiction, especially set during Ancient times, and anxiously picked this up to 'learn' about Hannibal. Unfortunately I found the writing uninspired and characters lacking development. Further, as the characters 'drop' in and out of the story it can be difficult at times to remember what there role was."
3,Fogerty's A Survivor,"This album was made under stress with John Fogerty battling Fantasy and his past.What came out was a mixed album and public indifference.I qualify this release as a worthy failure,with such stellar tracks as ROCKIN' ALL OVER THE WORLD,LONELY TEARDROPS,and ALMOST SATURDAY NIGHT. Unfortunately,there are some clunkers,too:THE WALL,YOU RASCAL YOU,SEA CRUISE.John sounds in fine raspy form;the production sounds tinny,though . This album showed that Fogerty would continue to fight his CREEDENCE image to the very end and try new approaches.Unfortunatelu,his record company refused to release his next album HOODOO,and as a result,Fogerty would keep silent until CENTERFIELD."
5,Underrated,"This Album was part of JCF's obligation to the Fantasy records then owned by Vanz Kant Danz, whom screwed CCR big time and got richerrrr. The song ""You Rascal You"" is also about the guy who later sued John for ""IMMITATING HIS OWN SONGS'.Any hooo, this album was popular outside US and the Payola system was the cause here. I have 2 new CD's for keeps sake. Why it is not being remasrered is beyond me.""The Wall"" is pure Bayoo CCR. Almost Sturday Night is great. EXCELLENT. Buy it if you find one."
4,A Must-Have if you're a really Fogerty's fan.,I've always wanted to have this vinyl but i had to wait until now to get it. It's pretty cool and the sound is very similar to Creedence but you can hear more of Fogerty's originality.
2,It's all in the sound.,"The album is excellent, brilliant songs, great saturday night listening but that's spoiled by the unbelievably bad cd quality , it's shocking! , a contender for the worst cd mastering ever.John fogerty deserves better than this."
2,A Bootleg Could Sound Better,"I have been a Recording Engineer. This CD is one of the worst I have heard -IF it is a studio mix. The guitar is so loud it drowns out most everything else. There is no bass, the drums sound like they were two doors away when recorded. John's voice when you can hear it is good. This has a good selection of songs but the mastering makes me wish that I could return it. I have heard bootleg albums that sounded better in my opinion. A BIG disapointment. A waste of my time ordering and money."
2,Not the best experience,"I don't like these because both the color and the overall quality. Some appear to be flat - and don't ""reshape"" very easily. Plus the white ball gets dirty very easy and is not easy to keep clean. Might try the black - but also might search for other alternatives."
2,Conscientious and dull,"A disappointment for Greene fans, or at least this one. I found this movie conscientious, slow and obvious, and the acting duo of Burton and Taylor didn't help. Burton's usual tired self loathing seemed phoned in. Taylor's lack of depth gave him nothing to play off of, assuming he was ready to try. She was so carefully made up and coiffed that one was always aware that it was a star turn for Taylor. And the movie is long. What would have been interesting, and might have made an effective movie although it would never have happened, would have been to cast Guinness in Burton's role and Burton in Guinness' role. Yes, Haiti was awful then. And, yes, Haiti is awful now. But no matter how serious the message, a movie's first responsibility is to be well made and effective. The Comedians tries way too hard to be ""meaningful."""
5,the dynamic 60's couple at there best!,"There was only one Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton. They were the most famous on screen and off screen couple of the 60's and you can see why in this great movie collection. This 5 disc box set includes four of there all time great films. 1963's the v.i.p's, 1965's the sandpiper, 1966's who's afarid of virgina wolf?, and 1967's the comedians. get it today, you'll love it!"
4,Where is BOOM!?,"Great collection, but how ridiculous to release this without the inclusion of the cult classic BOOM! It's Burton and Taylor at their most strung-out and self-absorbed and one of those films that must be seen to be believed."
2,Worth an lazy afternoon watch,Has anything really changed in Haiti? I wonder. Shocker was I thought Taylor was imitating a FRENCH accent and turns out she is GERMAN!Didn't sound German at allOK movie if you lived thru that era which I did. Nothing special but for a lazy Sunday Afternoon....OK
3,When is Boom ...,"About the missing chef-d'oeuvre ""Boom"", let's quote Tenessee Williams :""This is the best movie ever made after one of my plays"".It says it all.But we can add : It's a film by Joseph Losey, there's a superb music by John Barry, and Noel Coward is at his best. Not to mention Burton/Taylor.But -please- this is not a ""camp"" film. It's a very poetic film, that 's all. If you want ""camp"" by Losey, you can watch ""Modesty Blaise""."
4,"Amazing cast, fascinating adaptation of Graham Greene novel","Echoing the same all-consuming desire that epitomized their mercurial off-screen reltaionship, Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor deliver superlative performances in this powerful drama of politics and passion. Adapting his own best-selling novel for the screen, distunguished author Graham Green delivers a devastating indictment of Haitian dictator ""Papa Doc"" Duvalier and his regime of terror. Starring: Elizabeth Taylor Alec Guinness Richard Burton Peter Ustinov From the novel by Graham Greene Co Starring: Paul Ford Lillian Gish Screenplay by Graham Green Produced and Directed by Peter Glenville"
3,"Some, but not all","This is a great set of 4 of their best films together, but it is missing at least two other great works: The Taming of the Shrew and Boom!. Under Milk Wood would have been nice, too (though I haven't seen it yet).If you're thinking of buying Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf for the special features, just get this for $17 more (everything on the 2-disc is on this one). The VIPs is at least worth it, and there's enough interesting bits between The Sandpiper and The Comedians to rewatch later."
4,Arrived earlier than approx. ship date - in great condition,Arrived earlier than approx. ship date - in great condition. I would definately order from them again!
4,Great shoes,"I have to wear sneakers all the time because of a bad ankle/leg injury. My physical therapist recommended New Balance because they prevent me from rolling my feet outward. These shoes indeed keep me from doing that. They fit very well and are true to size (I have 11 M). My feet feel secure and most importantly, my ankle feels secure in these shoes."
5,love these shoes,I bought these New Balance 844's in a 7W and they fit wonderfully. They are wore out now so I bought the New Balance 926's in a 7W. They are way too big and look like clown shoes on me. They make the bottom of my foot sore below my big toe. Heavy socks doesn't help. I want to get a new pair but I don't know what size to order. My Reebok's were always 6 1/2 W and fit fine. I don't understand why New Balance shoes don't fit the same in different models. They don't have any left in my size in the 844's.
5,Excellent book!,"J.D. Brown recommended this book in his recent article, therefore, I ordered it. Undoubtedly, this is an excellent book on survey instrument. It guides from constructing the survey to reporting it. I wish It had provided detail steps for analyzing the survey instrument, particularly statisticaly procedures."
5,I'd give this a 6 if I could,I've listened to all sorts of alt-country but this is IT! Unfortunately this band has broken up but this CD belongs in your collection even if you don't like alt-country that much.
4,Christopher Cross - Rendezvous,"Excellent, clearly one of Christopher's best efforts. Superbly crafted lyrics and captivating tunes. Too bad this album has remained quite obscure."
5,good from what i heard on the samples,Does anyone know if that song where soloman and the other guy are riding down the hill on their bikes is on here?If so I'd like to know who it's by......thanks
5,"Men, a great gift for the woman in your life!","Someone purchased this for me about 20 years ago & it has since become my signature scent. I never leave home without putting it on. Then I forget it is on, can't smell it but obviously others can. Thru the years, many people have asked me what perfume I am wearing...most often men asking because they want to buy it for their significant other. She'll be glad you did!!"
5,SUBTLE SCENT,My daughter used to use it when the economy was good. I wanted her to have what she loved so bought it for her Christmas gift in 2012.
5,BEAUTIUDL SCENT!!!,NICE ORIENTAL SPICE ALONG THE LINES OF MAGIE NOIR TYPE OF PERFUME. IT JUST DOES NOT LAST LONG THOUGH. I HAVE NOTICED THAT THEY ARE WATERING DOWN THE PERFUMES THESE DAYS AND YOUR MONEY'S WORTH IS BECOMING A THING OF THE PAST. SO WITH THAT IN MIND IM NOT SURE I WOULD PURCHASE ANOTHER BOTTLE BUT IT IS A WONDERFUL FRAGRANCE FOR AS LONG AS IT LASTS.
2,Paloma Picasso-- Pretender or just too Old?,"This is not the ""real thing"". I have been using Paloma Picasso Eau De Parfum for at least 15 years so I know what the ""real thing"" smells like and so does my husband. Either this is a fake or it is so old that the fragrance has changed.Whichever it is, I feel as though I have been cheated. Unfortunately I cannot return it because it has been opened and tried.However, I would like to caution others not to trust this vendor based on my experience.I give this a ZERO STAR rating, no matter what the review publishes because I noticed there are 2 stars and I cannot change that now."
1,False Advertising,"I ordered and paid for 2 bottles of 3.4 oz. Paloma Picasso perfume. I was sent two bottles of 1.7 oz. by the website. When I complained both toAmazon and to ANTOnline, I was told to return the 1.7 oz because ANTOnlie had made an ""Advertising"" mistake. I said that when I buy something in any store that is marked a certain price then the store is RESPONSIBLE and legally contracted to provide what was advertised and for the price I remove it from the shelf. I was refunded my money of $102.99 but I believe that I wasted a lot of time ordering and should have been given what I purchased. ANTOnline should be penalized for its ""false advertising."" I will never purchase from ANTOline and will advise others NOT TO PURCHASE FROM ANTOnline."
5,I love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I really think that is one of the most delicious perfumes all times!!! and the quality of this i got was perfect. trust on the seller
5,have bought it before. loved the price!,"this is the au de parfume, better than au de toillette. great perfume and if you can find the $100ml for below $70 go for it! tax free at JFK will be more expensive"
1,Can't Realistically Hold a Fender,"These were a great idea - they are highly adjustable and could be used in many places on the boat - through a cleat, over a rail, over a wakeboard tower, etc. So, it was with great excitement that I purchased these... Unfortunately, even with as much velcro as there is length-wise, it's not strong enough. After a few tugs on the fender, the velcro came loose. These could not be used when tied up to another boat or dock as they wouldn't last more than a few minutes.These might work much better if they were wider and had more gripping power..."
3,Not exactly what I was expecting.,"The hammers aren't as long as I was expecting. They are only about 9"" long. When I hold it in my hand, the hammer head is nearly touching my hand. It seems like, if you need to bash out a window, you would need to hold the hammer near the very end of the handle. Otherwise your hand may get cut up from the glass.The orange handle is really cheap plastic.They blade and the hammer heads look to be high quality though.Overall...okay purchase for the price. I trust that they will work for what they are intended for."
5,emergency hammer,"The recipient of these hammers was very pleased to receive them. Really liked the size, which makes it easier for storage in the car."
5,hope i never need it,All my old cars had crank windows i know that seems strange today but its true so when i bought my new pickup with power windows it made me think alot more about this product . after watching mythbusters show about getting out of sinking car that was all i needed to see. I am very happy with this product its well made put 1 in wifes car & 1 in mine seat belt cutter is also a nice touch im not one for wearing my seatbelt but with all the new laws i now put it on so i dont get a ticket . I hope i never need to use this tool but the next visit to the junk yard sounds like a good place to try it out. Tool is well made and looks like it will last a lifetime .
3,smaller than i thought,"since it's a promising brand, i sellect these. smaller than i thought. i had an old one and it's bigger/longer/havier. no place to test these. should work, i suppose."
2,Where's the Quality,This product has no heft to it. Why? The handle is hollow and seemingly made of cheap plastic. There are a myriad of other materials that would have made this a better life-saving tool. It is much too expensive for the cheap materials used.
3,the duck and the decorated shed,"venturi's book highlights the inherent complexity in today's post-modern society, coupled with the depth of comprehension often mistaken by critics. A must buy for Architecture students!"
3,Ok if Architecture field or class,Didn't even open this book but if you are an architectural major this might be a great book.
1,Fingers,"I have realised that my last review was completely wrong. This book has gone down in my estimation when i realised how little coverage of finger-mazes is contained within the glossy text. More finger mazes please, Adrian."
3,Something to talk about sound track,I bought this soundtrack for the title song - but it's not on the CD!
5,Gorgeous,"These earrings have become a favorite. Beautiful, look more expensive than they were. Wish I could get them in more colors. Definitely a great buy."
3,Great idea/theme but lousy quality,"I bought this for my almost 3 year old girl. She has played with it a couple of times but gets frustrated because the slides & rope thing keep coming off. It would have been nice if this toy were a bit larger so that the small kelly dolls can get up and down and through it more easily too.I would recommend something else like the fisher price loving family playsets, if you want a realistic, not too large playset. They are of MUCH better quality."
5,4 year old loved it!,"Kelly playland is one of my daughters favorite toys, she got it for her 4th b-day. She likes to move it from table to floor and vice versa, this makes it frustrating, since everytime you move it, you have to put the slides back on. It has small balls, little brother loves to put them in his mouth. Other than that, it is a great value for Kelly fans."
1,Would be a 5 rating if it did not fall apart continuously.,"I purchased the Kelly Playland for my daughter about two weeks ago. Assembly was easy. Once my daughter wanted to move this toy to another part of the house, the purple slide fell off. Next as I set the playland down, blam, the rolling slide fell off. Each time my daughter plays with this toy, something falls off. Sure you can re-assemble it with no problem, but who wants a toy that is so much hassle? I plan to phone Mattel with my complaint as this is absolutely unacceptable. What a complete waste of my time buying this toy and my money!"
2,What happened???,"I had high hopes for this book but I never really felt a connection with the main characters; Joe or Nicky. I've read a couple other books by Robards and liked them; ""Obsession"" and ""Guilty"". Maybe it's the mood I was in, but I didn't enjoy this one."
1,Boring psychic trash,"I'm sorry to be so hard on a writer that I usually like. But I'm sick of psychic things. Some people is disgusted to read too hot or porn sex descriptions, I am disgusted when I find esoterical things, magic, people who ""sees"" dead people and all those things that, for me, are just rubbish. I think it should be tagged that way: ""weird-fiction"" or something like that, so people like me that like reading a good love story but do not believe in occult ""sciences"" can have a good time.Apart from characters that see dead people, the plot is boring, there is no sexual tension between the characters, not an interesting landscape,... I don't know, I was hoping the killer came and killed them all about the page 50."
2,What a disappointment!,"I agree with the other reviewers who touched on the fact that Ms. Robards dragged the story at a snail's pace by cramming even the most insignificant of sentences full of ridiculous descriptions. Considering she took forever building up the suspense, the ending seemed outrageously short.I did like certain aspects of the plot, I even liked the main characters and their relationship development but boy did this novel just not live up to its potential."
2,DFK,This is my first book CD that I have listend to from Karen Robards and I was very disapointed. The book did not keep my attention and I thought that there was too much explainations on just everything. I do think that Joyce Bean did a wonderful job of narrating and she saved the book for me.
2,Soft Porn and Silly,"I think what killed the book for me is when one of the characters had their hands handcuffed behind their back and yet still managed to reach into the front pocket of their pants.Soft Porn? Some of the descriptions were a bit too much, many of them focussed on Nicky's upper body. Nicky seemed to be in heat throughout most of the book!Authors - Adjectives are good when used judiciously. However using adjectives to modify other adjectives does not mean you have command of the language.This book had a variety of plot potholes that should have been patched during the final edit. Shame on you editor.Finally I would describe the ending of this book as probably the best example of deus ex machina ever.Let see, Southerners check, girlfriends with kids check, pet pigs check, island check, extended family all under one roof check, psychics check, smartass reporter from Chicago check, hunky chief of police with checkered past check. I think that about covers it."
1,Fail!,"Cheesy! Silly! Unbelievable... and ... boring!I actually forgot I was reading this a few times. The plot is lame, the romance is sad... Just ehhhh!"
3,so so,"This was my first karen robards book, and it was alright. I liked the charactor interaction and the pace was good, however there were parts that woren't developed well at all. The psycic angle could have been much more interesting for example if the spirit guide and the block had anything to do with the story, not to mention the blocked psycic ability had been explored. I also didn't like how the story was stumbling along and then out of nowhere all the loose ends get tied up in a neat little bow and it turns out being people who have very little bearense on the story itself. I wouldn't recomend it as a fabulous read but it's certainly not the worst book I've ever read and it was interesting enough to finish."
2,Where's The Beef?,"Superstition by Karen Robards has an interesting story line, but not enough to justify trudging through all the obvious filler. More is not always better. Of the book's 478 pages, eighty percent is padding. What a waste of paper."
5,Another Great Book!,"This is another book I would give 10 stars! Even loved the little pig, Cleo! Read it, you'll love it!"
1,"Okay what is a Hippocrene, anyway?","Hmm...This book does combines parts of a dictionary and a phrase book. The bad parts. OKay, when will authors learn you CAN'T learn Korean using translateration? The phrasebook part of this book provides much less than even the smallest Korean phrase book and to call this thin tome a dictionary is just plain wrong. It provides, oh, so much less than a normal pocket dictionary, it is not even funny. Shell out the cash and, oh may, buy both a dictionary and a phrase book. Go ahead, treat yourself..."
3,its a dictionary,"good introduction for language student. great help finding words easy to use,extra information needed by student of Korean LANGUAGE AND CULTURE"
3,"Roshell Anderson's ""Steppin' Out"" both hits and misses.","Roshell Anderson's 1990-released CD ""Steppin' Out"" has a much more contemporary feel than its predecessor (1989's ""Sweet N Sour Rhythm & Blues""). Slow-tempo ballads and mid-tempo numbers like ""Twilight State"", ""Bodies Talking"", ""Passionate Transition"" and the socio-conscious ""Peace"" and ""Victim Of A System"" all show that Anderson is a true disciple of Old School 1960s-'70s Soul but the overly-synthesized and electronic/programmed beats-based production and instrumentation both make the material sound dated and are not the best choice for backing a singer like Anderson (who obviously owes a huge stylistic debt to the likes of Al Green and Curtis Mayfield)."
4,a revisited classic,"This CD gets better as you play it. It first introduced me to Angel Moraes and he's a supabahd DJ! :) The original song on ""Disco"" is kinda boring. But they really jazzed it up this time around. I'm a Pethead extraordinaire and I can honestly say this is one of their best CD singles."
1,No good,"I am disappointed with this puchase. Owerall quality is very low, band was made recklessly and rude. Tubes have different size. Velocity decreased about 30% comparing with Trumatk standard pull. It is very unpleasant to recieve such low quality product"
4,Fits perfectly and works like a charm,This slingshot band fit perfectly in the slingshot that I've had since I was a kid. It's powerful and has a long life time.
4,Slingshot Band,"Haven't actually tried it out yet, but it went on nicely and seems to be tight. One tip: Once I put it on and it was still wet and movable, I pulled back slightly with one finger to make sure each side was evenly adjusted. You can adjust each side accordingly before it dries. One thing I didn't care for was the magnetic ball pouch. My other band had a soft leather pouch that wrapped around the ball tight. This pouch seems rather stiff and hard to bend around the ball. Like I said though, I haven't put it to the test yet, so maybe this will break-in a little.Overall though, it was easy to install. Just follow the directions and wet it good. Let it sit overnight before trying to be sure it is dry."
1,Never recieved,"I never recieved my order, after communication from the seller I contacted the USPS with a tracking number (per their instruction). They said it was delivered... I order from Amazon all the time, this is the only product I have paid for and never recieved. Neither the Post Office or the seller are taking any responsibility for my missing order... Order at you own risk! The seller has changed from the military trail gear shop from whom I ordered to cheap humididors."
5,My Vintage,"This act was composed of the children of The King Sisters of the King Family. Tina Cole is the most recognizible since she went on to star on My Three Sons as the wife of the character, Robbie Douglas played by the late Don Grady. Like Lawerence Welk, they were a staple on Saturday night. Mr.Welk had the Lennon Sisters and The King Family had The Four Kings but unlike the Lennons they were not as successful. Two of the original Lennon Sister still perform while these women chose Motherhood. But if you are my vintage you will enjoy it."
3,Not for the weak,"This book contains verbatim case decisions from Supreme Court cases, District level cases and Appellate court cases. Each case is followed by a detailed comment section written by the editors which explains in plain English what the Justices are talking about. All the way from the First Amendment and Marketplace of Ideas theory to broadcast regulation, this book covers all major cases that have developed media law into the beast it is today. Good for the classroom, but better without a time limit."
5,AN EXCELLENT SAMPLE OF THE PIAF I SAW AS A CHILD,EDITH PIAF VISITED THE U.S. IN THE FIFTIES AND I REMEMBER SEEING HER BUT DID'NT FULLY UNDERSTAND HER SIGNIFICANCE. THIS CD IS A WONDERFUL EXAMPLE OF HER UNIQUE AND HAUNTING VOICE. A VOICE I CAN REMEMBER AFTER FIFTY YEARS. IT IS A GREAT WAY OF INTRODUCING FRIENDS TO THE SPARROW.
5,Better late than never,"I have just discovered Edith Piaf. I had bought a DVD called ""Forgotten Broadway"". One on of the tracks it has her signature song from her life story musical ""Piaf."" I have loved Broadway for years but i guess she was much before my time.What a discovery! I've been reading everything i can get my hands on about her and her life. Her voice and songs are amazing and it's funny how many of her songs now that i've discovered her, i have heard many times before.This CD is wonderful and has many of the songs that i've heard as a child and now becoming extremely found of. What a joy it must have been to see this amazing tragic women in person. All of her songs are so heart felt and give me goose-bumps. I have always found French music to be so romantic anyway and this CD really does it for me. Enjoy it with a nice glass of red wine."
5,Edith Piaf still sings,"To those who are not familiar with Miss Piaf's singing soon will become fans of this woman. The recent bio-pic ""La Vie en Rose"" has stirred interest in those who had not heard her before. They will be richly rewarded with this album. My favorite track is ""Non, je ne Regrette Rien""."
4,Excellent Selections of Her Recordings,This Edith Piaf collection is great. She recorded a tremendous amount of music. This CD captures the best of her recordings.
3,A Visit to the Past,"The sound on this c.d. is excellent. I enjoy listening to the music and the VOICE of Piaff. The only reason my stars stopped at three is, there are at lest three serious glitches that sound as though the person taping from a recording, hit the turntable and moved the record so that the music is interupted by NOISE. I am surprised that a c.d. containg this much interferance is on the market. And I am surprised that Amazon lists this flawed c.d.I purchased three different Edith Piaff c.d.s. Each of them contain the same disturbance of a botched recording session from turntable to c.d. Was this a home made C.D.?"
5,Simply perfect,"This album is simply perfect and it is by far the best compilation of her work. It contains all the great chansons she sang (Milord, Non Je Ne Regrette Rien, La Vie En Rose and my favorite L'Accordéoniste) though I miss Padam...Padam and Sous Le Ciel De Paris. It is Piaf that makes everyone think of the fantastic French culture and that ""French mood"". Everytime I listen to this CD I feel like I'm being in Paris. And this expereience never fades. In fact it gets only stronger."
3,The Voice of the Sparrow: The Best of Edith Piaf,"I bought this because I did not have a CD of Edith Piaf. She is unique, still. I enjoyed it, but would not play it every day."
3,Je chante pour raviver les memoires,"Les chante pour desveaux a la spirale duface. Ete si'il soussaint je ne pleivous a tesefioux. A voux voureis tesel prix choc messengous. Quasous tes va ca coutete vouasne. JE CHOAN TES VOULEUR QUE DUS DE LA ""EDITH PIAF"" QUASIFOUTIN.AT"
5,CLASSIC!,Edith sings the standars as well as her classics! She is wonderful to listen to and her voice can be heartbreaking. You know what she is conveying in her voice without knowing French!Absolutely romantic.
4,Little sparrow with a big voice.,"If you were not familiar with Piaf before, this would be the perfect retrospective of her work to learn what made her such an Icon. She was a Diva long before the word fell into overuse. Had this on CD and needed it on Kindle Fire!"
5,Great CD and good buy,This CD is great I am studing French and wanted some real French Music. It arrived in good condition and I am very satisfied with my purchase.
2,Voice of the Sparrow,"I was looking for a sound more representative of Piaf in an intimate Paris nightclub performance. Too much orchestra, and recording quality was disappointing."
2,Not Great,"As a science teacher I thought this would be a great resource. It is weak for h.s, maybe it would be good for elementary."
3,Some tools required!,"This book has some great really great projects and yes it does use low cost and recycled material BUT be warned to use this book to the T you will need some tools like a Caliper,clamps,a Vise,a few files,a few different saws and drill with drill bits!Now these are not something thatI have sitting in my garage,so something to keep in mind before buying this book.There are a few experiments that dont require you to use the above tools,so its not a total wash,just dont expect to open the book and start doing all the projects right away as you will need to make a trip to the hardware store!Just a fyi Iam using this in a home setting and not in a school."
5,Very Beautiful,"This has become one of my favorite sets - each CD is just beautiful,and makes wonderful background music for whatever you are doing. I highly recommend the set."
4,THEY ARE SO BEAUTIFUL!!!,"This silverware is really pretty. I won't give it the max. 5 star rate because they are a little bit heavy for my taste. But for the value, I believe they are truly a jewel."
4,an entertaining look at medicine,"it is not a encyclopedia in the traditional description. it is more of a leisure read,concerning medical topics. with the expected diseases and historical figures, come the little quirks;the elephant man, zombies and midwifes. the index makes finding specifics difficult, but if you're looking for fun and weird facts to scare your friends, then this is the book for you."
3,"Hazy, folk- and psychedelic-tinged melancholy","This is an interesting CD. At first I didn't like it very much, but it grew on me. Hope Sandoval's voice takes some getting used to, but eventually it becomes a distinctive part of the music. She sounds very world-weary, slurring her notes up and down often. Sometimes she sounds just a bit off-key. The accompanying instruments are mostly acoustic, though there is a distortion-drenched guitar in ""Blue Flower."" The style doesn't sustain my interest for an entire CD's length, but nevertheless there is some pretty good stuff here."
4,Worked for me!,"Sometimes when I order c-ds from Amazon I get broken plastic, missing covers, only the c-d itself however I was pleased with my Mazzy Star album it rocks! Thanks Melany!"
5,Mazzy Star - She Hangs Brightly,"It's a great CD. It was recommended by my fiance. It's like the doors with a soulful, bluesy, female singer."
5,my title,"Really uplifting album. Its fun, its bright, and it doesn't drag. Its an energetic album with a dated sound but nonetheless its has a feeling that is reminiscent of the 90s-seattle-grunge-indie era that I'm surprised it wasn't on the singles or reality bites soundtrack."
1,Awful Re-recordings,"This album does not contain original recordings. I compared ""Yakety Yak"" to the version on the ""Stand By Me"" Soundtrack album. THAT one has the real ORIGINAL RECORDING. This album has re-recordings from a vocal group who may contain members of the original Coasters, but it is very obvious that these are NOT the same ORIGINAL RECORDINGS. Even the album cover artwork is awful and bogus. The image has NOTHING to do with The Coasters. Don't be fooled, as I was.By the way, the aforementioned ""Stand By Me"" Soundtrack album is a wonderful source for a nice mix of great Oldies, with outstanding sound and TRUE ORIGINAL RECORDINGS!"
5,What A Great Christmas Memory Book!,"Having reviewed several similar memory books, ""Our Christmas Memories Book"" is the best I've seen. It is beautifully laid out, well-made and thoughtfully organized and provides an excellent repository for preserving memories of friends, family and traditions. ""Our Christmas Memories Book"" has become ""my"" Christmas memory book, and I know my family and I will cherish it in the years to come."
3,More Of A Can Cruncher Than A Can Crusher,"Be aware that this does not flatten cans from top to bottom, but crunches them in the middle. The cans become smaller than they were, but not by that much. It does not have to be mounted, and it is pretty sturdy and easy to use. The shipping was costly and not very speedy. Overall, it is better than nothing."
4,oceanview,"This can crusher has worked really well for us.It sits on our kitchen counter where the cans are ""produced"". It does not take up much space and is not unsightly like the wall mounted ones. Easy to use with a little elbow grease, light weight and basic design makes it highly useable and convenient."
3,It's OK,"The bottom of the crusher is too rough for my counter, I had to glue a rubber mat to the bottom to feel I could use it on the counter. I also wish it would crush the cans just a little smaller. It works well enough but just quits a little too soon."
2,Missing parts when received,It was received with a missing part (the pin that should connect the arm and base is missing so it doesn't crush-just pushes the handle up and you cannot apply pressure). There was no broken piece in the box so it was shipped defective. I have contacted the vendor about a replacement so I will see if there is a quick resolution and follow up. As others said-it doesn't make it too much easier to crush the cans-you still need to apply a bit of pressure with your hands - but it beats using your feet and having to bend down over and over to pick them up when doing full bags.
2,A sweet tale but a weak novel,This novella is the weakest of Mark Harris's Henry Wiggens books. It is to be read by those who have to read everything in the series but compared to The Southpaw and Bang the Drum Slowly it comes up short. Weak in plot and in inventivness but strong in sugar.
3,OK Book,Novel was ok but what the heck was that preface in the front of the book???? Crazy ramblings about writing and nothing whatsoever to do with the novel. I guess they needed filler to make the book a little thicker
5,Christmas Movie,"THEY WERE FAST SHIPPERS, WITH NO PROBLEMS. BOTH MOVIES WERE SWEET AND WORTH THE PRICE. THANKS A LOT. HAPPY HOLIDAYS"
3,About Family,The Christmas Child is a wonderful story of family. A one person's search for the truth of his last leads him to his future.A time to Remember a sad story of how losing a loved one can be a challenge.
2,Strange.......,"This set is very much a mixed bag. The first problem is that the discs are presented out of order. If you know anything about the chronology of WW2, you can figure out their correct order.Ike's son, Gen. John, provides linking intros to the ""videos"" as he calls them. The ""videos"" are actually WW2 footage with narration. I really can't tell if they used government produced documentaries, or if this is just an old television show about WW2 (similar to VICTORY AT SEA).The footage used is a mixed bag as well, some of it looks great, though. I would only recommend this for the most ardent WW2 enthusiast."
3,great detail on the subject,"great rip murals,the pics are well taken and very professional.most of the pics even have the sad story as to why the murals was created.very sad but its the life of the streets.a good buy worth the cash"
4,WHAT I REALLY WANTED WAS A NEW COLLECTION OF PINKWATER'S,"NPR columns, particularly the ones when he was looking atbeing a person-of-size in America, but since no new ones havecome out, I picked this up as one of his most recent young adult novels. I expect much of this is autobiographical but it is very funny and wise and has a two-page reading list that I believe mayactually BE a list of the books Pinkwater read in High School. Chances are if you are even reading this review, you have already decided to buy this book. So, go ahead."
3,very strong deja vu,"I, too, have read Pinkwater's essays and some of his fiction. From what he tells the reader elsewhere, one can't help but wonder if this is his own (very thinly veiled) autobiography. If so, it's pretty dishonest to simply change the names and call it fiction. Writing fiction ought to take a bit more creativity and spark than that but sadly often doesn't. Revisiting the same old territory again and again (fat kid with wacky Jewish family hates school, but finds people and ideas he can relate to outside of it) may result in faithful readers buying anything you publish, but it doesn't do much to let you grow as a writer."
5,I suppose I should wait until my head stops swimming...,"I finished reading this book not but half an hour ago, and it's one of the most amazing things i've ever read. Pinkwater at his very best, but a great deal more than that -- invites favorable comparison the the works of Saki and the early Vonnegut. A witty, astute, hedonistic critique of American culture and education. Buy it right now."
3,The Old Magic,"A nostalgic read, as I haven't dipped into the Pinkwater pool since early middle school. His easy style hasn't changed much over the years, and this was a super fast and light read. Fun stuff."
5,Brilliant,"An absolutely brilliant, enormous work on the subject of preaching, the best of its kind. Edwards studies the various movements of the history of preaching with attention to both individuals who shaped oration and historical trends that affected the discipline. A helpful CD with exemplary samples from various periods is included inside the front cover. This book will be a standard manual for the next century.James W. Miller is the author ofGod Scent: A Devotional."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE,"The programmer ruined my ECM, and had to have it replaced. $190 later car is running stock again, The item I received was a return and sold to me as new. The programmer had another VIN in it before I got it, and I did not know, lesson learned, take it to a professional and have a performance shop do it, a lot cheaper in the long run."
3,Costly for what you can do,It's ok. Not a lot you can do with it. Maybe you can do more with newer model cars?.?.? I just needed to adjust my speedometer and it did the job.
5,Fire escape Ladder,"I purchased this for my daughter who is living in an upper floor apartment. I worry about escapecapabilities, even if there is a carbon monoxide/fire detector in the building. This works to insurean escape - heavy, but can be stored under a bed for emergencies."
4,Sturdy ladder - requires lots of practice,"The kids begged for this - little fire safety buggers they are. But at 4 and 5 years old, they would only climb up the ladder from the ground instead of out the window from the bedroom, lol. I went out the bedroom window and the ladder was fine. Only problem - I have a window on the floor below, so I was real worried about the ladder not having a wall to brace it for a 6 foot section down."
4,Surprisingly good!,"I don't recall how I managed to get a copy of this CD, but I am glad that I have it. I never realized that Vanna White could actually sing....and sound good doing it! If the story and songs on this CD don't get you into the Holiday spirit, then nothing will. The music is by Leslie Bricusse (who wrote the story), Henry Mancini and John Williams. The CD also features Tom Bosley (as Santa Claus) and Tony Danza (as The Tap Dancing Elf). The story is about how Santa had to deal with the growing population of the world and it's modern inventions and how he threatened to resign in 1999.Track listing:1. Holiday Time2. Christmas Story3. Father Christmas4. Somewhere In My Memory - featuring Tom Bosley5. Making Toys6. Every Christmas Eve7. Santa Claus Is Coming To Town8. Christmas Children9. Santa's Last Ride - featuring Tom Bosley10. A Christmas Carol11. It's Christmas Again12. Giving13. Christmas Wishes14. Thank You Santa"
4,"""Uniquely You"", by Betty Nethery :","I was most impressed with the obvious calibre of this authoress's character and insights. It is much more than a fashion book. The only lack is that it was written way back when, and it needs to be updated into 2003 color charts and the way women wear amkeup and clothing styles. This book is a classic, though.The concepts are timeless, as is the general advice.I appreciated the Christian influence of the book. Very tasteful and appropriate.I particularly likes the advice about how to dress parts of your body you want to hide. I have not seen this advice anywhere else. She looks beautiful on the cover of her book, but blue eyeshadow is definitely out of style now. Also, no one wears bow-tie secretary blouses anymore either."
3,Interesting Period Piece,"""Uniquely You"" combines sound and thorough fashion advice with a weird, regressive Christian take on a woman's place. At times a throwback to the days of ""The Total Woman"", this book may offend some, but others will find a great deal of unintentional humour. If a reader can disregard the intrusive bible quotes, and get past the ludicrous chapter on helping your husband dress himself (no, this is not meant for spouses of paraplegics) there is quite a bit of good information on colour and style. Mind you, the model on the cover wears bright blue eyeshadow, so one might choose to read with a grain of salt handy."
5,bathing made easier,"I bought this item about 3 weeks ago and have used it 3 times now. We have 2 dogs, a labrador & a cockapoo, and it works for both of them. Our lab is very strong and he didn't pull this off the bathtub wall. Both our dogs are active and try to jump out whenever they can during bath time and this tie down held them both. I am thinking about buying this for my mom who has two small yorkies that never stop moving!"
5,I would not be able to give my dog a bath without these!,"My dog hates baths and will do anything to get away. Without these tethers, it would be impossible to give my dog a bath without another person's help. These do exactly what they say they will do and the price is right. I highly recommend this purchase!"
5,Helps me with bath time,I have a 10-month old chow-lab mix who is deathly afraid of water. It was so hard keeping her in the tub before but with these she has not choice but to stay in the bathtub. Your tub has to be clean and dry for the suction cups to stick and the straps are a bit too long for my size tub but they still work great and keep her still.
5,This things are strong!,"Pros:1. Suction is very strong, once pressed against my tub's bottom I had a difficult time removing them.2. Holds my dog's head still and helps to prevent her from leaving the bathtub3. Straps have a solid construction feeling to themCons:1. Does not hold her rear in the tub(though not designed to do so) as such she will put half her body out of the tub if I am not watching.Other Thoughts:1. These should make bath time much easier if you have a dog that does not like bath time. Make sure to position them on the bottom of the tub, they have a very strong suction, but if placed on the sides will slide upwards freeing your dog."
4,Hold That Doggie!,"We gave these to our daughter for Christmas and she was delighted. She was looking forward to the additional ""help"" while bathing her dogs."
2,Not Happy,"I have two dogs, 40 lbs. and 80 lbs. These tethers will not hold either one. Also, they will only stick to a smooth surface. So if you have a textured tile shower, forget it."
4,Old School,Reminds me of the old days. Fun songs that help me work out. Glad that Amazon sells music.
5,"BBB and R""H""V dropping the bomb!!1","HOUSE CONNECTION is an awesome hard-bangin house Cd that all dance music fans should check out. I bought this Cd when it was first released and I still continue to listen to it all the time. BBB and RHV keep the music flowing and their mixing here is flawless. I like to mess around on the truntables, but I wish I had the talent that these 2 guys have. One just has to check out the quality of this Cd and you can see why these 2 guys are probably the best house Dj's in the country right now"
4,Dated hard house CD,"Excellent mixing, lots of different tracks, classic hard hosue CD. BUT, a lot of the tracks are dated sounding and some have cheesy vocal samples that take away from the quality of the driving hard house sound (cheesy as in cheesy bad, not cheesy good). The sound of this CD is less energetic and more funky than other CDs. Its OK. I might have loved it in 1996, but its kind of boring now."
3,FYI...Not for Keurig B70,If you want a small cup of coffee this is probably great but the water goes through the filter too slow to make an 11oz mug. It will overflow with the keurig B70 on the large size.
2,Not of interest to me. A little distressing.,"I'm glad I didn't buy this book, now that I've seen it. Although the reproduction quality of the photographs is very good, the photographs themselves aren't interesting to me and are even a bit distressing.I haven't seen the film(s) or exhibitions about Nan's work though. There is some information about her work on the web - take a look at Yahoo."
2,No way to learn a language,Forget trying to learn a language this way. Try getting into a videa chat room with people from other countries so you can REALLY practice. Forget these scam programs.
3,Ok if you are REALLY into maps,"I got this book for my boyfriend (who is Armenian) because I thought it would be a fun coffee table book that anyone could pick up. Unfortunately, the maps are too overwhelming and the descriptions of the maps (obviously) talk more about the creation of the map than the history of Armenia. I'm sure he'll like it, but not the others around the coffee table."
3,Item Description,"This item is a PAMPHLET, which is to say that it is a few pieces of paper stapled together. It is not what most people would identify as a paperback. While ""Content is King,"" in this case, the full contents of this pamphlet could probably be made into a website in about an hour (without scanning). It is unlikely that you will be pleased with the shipping costs for what can easily be mailed to you in a regular business envelope."
3,Good primary source,"Nice to show children the past through recorded history. Also, it is a great way to jump start conversation among the older folks. I would not recommend this series for the serious JFK assassination sleuth. There is much better material out there in form of books and raw, unedited footage on You Tube."
5,Award Winning Footage,"Excellent DVD containing unseen footage from years past. It was interesting how the show went from black & white to color and how the events unfolded as they happened. I have seen bits and pieces of this footage over the years but it nice to see more coverage of events for example, when Kennedy was in Fort Worth giving his speech or the interviews of the Dallas police and the witnesses of the shooting. Was interesting to see how live television broadcast the news live back then. I was only 5 when JFK was killed, so I barely remember the events, although I seem to remember watching the funeral on tv with my parents. This show will not settle the debate between the lone assassin and the conspiracy buffs, but if you want to see a piece of history as it actually happened, this DVD is a excellent source, though tragic and sad."
4,Sturdy DVD case saves space,"These Slappa Hardbody 90 DVD holders are decently built, certainly more sturdy than the types available at retail stores. My only gripe is that the interior sleeves should be at least another inch away from the binding, as I've found it much more difficult to place a DVD and its artwork in those sleeves. If you have a ton of DVDs, these cases work well. I do believe, however, that Slappa 70 DVD boxes work even better, and look more natural placed in an entertainment center or bookshelf."
5,My Favorite Szabo Album,"This album is my favorite of Gabor Szabo. Only available as an expensive Japanese remaster. It is good, solid 60's experimental jazz with Szabo's distinctive guitar front & center. By this if you are already into Szabo & want these good songs which are not available elsewhere."
5,Perfect,"Great price and value for these heavy duty wrenches. All sizes one could ever need. Made well, can't go wrong with Stanley."
5,Exactly what it should be,"I ordered these for my son and they are exactly as they appear. Good quality, and enough sizes for regular use."
3,Good enough,"The ruler does not fit in the case properly, it is slightly too long for the designated slot. The dial caliper is made in China. The micrometer and ruler source were not identified. The micrometer action is good. The dial caliper has required frequent zeroing."
5,"Works well, great tools","I didn't expect for the price that these would be as high quality. They are very usable and very nice tools; calibration is easy. The only minor criticism is that the ruler provided does not fit in the slot in the case. I wish this came in metric sizes for the price, but it is a very nice set of tools."
4,Little cheesy but works,"For the price you can not beat it, but, and will work for light use. I only plan on light use and this will do just fine."
2,disappointed,The bag that I received with my order was nothing like the bag advertised.It looked nothing like it and didn't even have a front pocket. It was very frustrating.It took a while to get things together from them for the return which was also frustrating. A few weeks later I finally got my money back. The tripod seemed great though. But I never ordered anything else from them.
4,Great Product,I have been using DCL Glycolic Acid pads for a few years now under the instruction/advice of my Dermatologist. They help control my oily skin & help lighten my acne scars.
4,Spine-Tingling Conspiracy!,This book was certainly a page-turner and is interesting reading for anyone!
5,Poignant read,"These RTA series of books are based on the television series that ran for seven seasons during the 90s. The show is beloved by fans and is one of the best family-friendly shows ever screened on television. I have all the DVDs and watch them every year. These books follow the television episodes quite faithfully.This is one of my favorite RTA story. When former Avonlea resident Romney Penhallow comes back for a visit, Hetty King gets into a tizzy because Romney was her childhood sweetheart and also the man who once jilted Hetty for Rachel Lynde. Though still resentful over the past, Hetty gradually thaws toward Romney given his charming overtures. Little does Hetty realize that Romney harbors a dark secret, one that could jeopardize their fragile relationship. This is a poignant and bittersweet episode that deals with old love, friendships, and memories."
2,I EXPECTED MORE FROM THIS BOOK,"Much too simplistic and not alot of meat. Talk about many topics but not deep enough.Sometimes she says we should look for a friend in people who have same interest with us. Common sense. But I expected she will use a law of attraction to tell people how to attract great friends and people around us in our lives.Than you ask yourself a question: should you be using law of attraction or a common sense. I did not like that many pages are filled with big letters and quoatations. But that is only my opinion. She deserves a credit for a book, but she failed to deliver a message. She talks about abundance, law of attraction, and many other things but just simplistic. Not much meat inside."
5,The Only Jewish Cookbook You'll Ever Need,"Being the owner of over 100 cookbooks, it is rare when I find one that piques my interest as well as my palate. Faye Levy has done it again with this new addition to her stable of Kosher cookbooks. If you are looking for that ""special"" recipe that reminds you of the one that momma used to make or looking to try something to satisfy a more modern taste, chances are that you will find it here."
5,Great even for non Jews,"We had been to a friends house who had prepared a dish from this cook book. Since we liked it so much we tried to find another copy. It is great. All or most of the recipes have a letter to signify for Passover, meat, dairy (which is handy for glancing through for something new)Latkes, potato soup, and lentil soup are Great."
4,Excellent read,"Overall I enjoyed the book. As pointed out in another review with a slightly lower rating, Scudder demonstrates his apathy towards a morally depraved criminal but unlike the other reviewer, I don't see this as a flaw in the book, rather as a flaw in the protaganist. In fact, the subplot is Scudder attempting to define his moral code, and in a very well written manner, seemingly panicing that he may not really have one.My only criticism is that I enjoy a bit quicker moving story. Personal preference is all, but why I didn't give it five stars.If you like the darker suspense genre with great character development, this is a must read."
3,Not bad early Scudder with a disturbing flaw,"""Time to Murder and Create"" is the second novel in the Matthew Scudder series. Like many of the earlier Scudder tales, it is relatively short and not a greatly complex story. The plotline is clever; an extortionist gets a premonition of his own murder and hires Scudder in advance to investigate if anything happens to him. The story is well told, and this still being Scudder's drinking period, it is full of plenty of despair and loneliness. One major flaw exists however. One of the people the extortionist is blackmailing is politically connected figure who has sex with underage boys. Scudder's lack of outrage at the man's activity leads to a less than approriate conclusion of the story. If this had been Andrew Vachss' Burke, the pedophile would have gotten his just desserts. Overall, this is a fairly conventional mystery by Block standards. But it does have its moments."
5,Great Tie!!,I got this tie for my husband at a great price. He wears it to work many times. It feels good and looks good! We love it!
3,Great graphics but boring as hell,"I actually think this anime is very boring. I didn't know about this title, but decided to buy it from the excellent reviews on Amazon. I shouldn't have.... I almost bought Season 2 together with Season 1. Good thing I didn'tElsie is adorable, but Keima is such a loser. The way that the girls fall in love with Keima is superficial. I was expecting something for dramatic and profound.Anyway, despite my disappointment, I am giving this anime an overall average rating due to great graphics."
1,Misogyny with a storyline,"Any self-respecting woman would see through the nasty messages in this anime, but luckily with its target audience, people don't care. But for those of us who don't want to blunder into something where women are basically worthless, take note.This is a story about a boy who takes advantage of girls emotions, and often their bodies, as if it were a game. The aim of the game is to get them to fall for him head over heels, after which he dumps them and heads onto his next mark, over and over. There is a halfhearted excuse given for the boy's actions, but it doesn't ring true.What does ring true is the way this anime depicts men as senseless, ruthless players, after women for nothing but a little fleeting fun. Worse is how women in it are nothing except for game pieces, that need to be emptied of their innocence, emotion, and ""treasure"" before they are forgotten about."
4,Textbook,"This book is being used for a graduate course on heaven,he'll and afterlife; great text for the class. I received the book in ample enough time for the class."
3,History of Religion,I have been studying early Christianity and the cultural context in which it took shape. I have found this book to be a good resource.
4,wing a ding is a delight.,"the characters and the dialogue are endearing. the illustrations are perfect. my 5 year old son loved it, but couldn't get over the fact that we still don't know what a wing a ding is."
1,You toss most of the book,This is basically a pop out tricycle that is fun for five minutes while yo assemble it with your child. Then you toss the bulk of the book in the garbage and watch as the tricycle falls apart until that too ends up in the trash. Lame.
2,OM MY GOD!,"I sincerely believe Ram Dass himself probably doesn't want you to watch this film. Shot in the very early days of his return from India, the film captures Dass apparently trying to turn a group of Caucasian drop-outs into Hindus For A Day. Dass' primary message is that Raja Yoga can give you an LSD-high without the expense and illegality. The film makers try to back that claim with low-tech attempts at psychedelic visuals that merely wind up looking ludicrous. Hippies doing shoulder stands appear no more mystical when projected upside down.Evolution of a Yogi would be good for a laugh if it wasn't for the $2.99 rental price, which is exorbitant for a 28 minute short."
4,Bad service,"Was charged for this item and it wasn't delivered. Contacted company and the finally sent the item. Later after I rated their site, not too good of a rating, by the way, they sent me e-mail and said if I removed the bad rating they would send my a gift. Just for the heck of it, I removed the rating and guess what....it has been 4 months and I have not received any gift. So I suggest before ordering from this place you make sure you really want the item and good luck getting it."
2,Great history....but incomplete storytelling,"The Columbia Sportswear story is one of the most compelling business building stories of our time. However, this books is a totally incomplete treatise. It is well written and somewhat captivating, but way too summarized if you expect to learn anything useful. It is a waste of time to read, although you'll only have to waste 20 minutes to read the entire book."
2,Not as Good,"I picked this book up from the library after my son (20 months) and I discovered ""Wake Up Engines"". Neither one of us cared for this one at all. It was missing the fun truck sounds that made him love the ""Wake Up Engines"" so much. The pictures are still beautiful but we didn't enjoy the story. The most enjoyment I got out of it was the look of horror on my son's face when he mistakenly brought me this one instead of the ""Wake Up"" book. Back to the library it went with no regrets."
3,"Trashing ""Trashing the Truth""","I rated this book three stars because I haven't read it yet but wanted to make a few remarks regarding the above review entitled ""Trashing the Truth."" The review was not helpful to me because its author doesn't address the content of Mr. Arnold's book, preferring instead to resort to the informal logical fallacies ad hominem, circumstantial ad hominem, appeal to emotion, and appeal to force. I won't make a hasty generalization about environmentalists, but I can say that the doomsayers seem to get quite a bit of mileage out of fallacious or shallow arguments and omission of relevant facts which contradict their conclusions. It is unfortunate that intellectual immaturity so often carries the day. Read Julian Simon, for goodness sake!"
3,The collards are worth it!!!,"I could see that most of the recipes in this book were garbage (esp after the biscuits came out terrible) but I cooked both of the collard greens recipes and they were OUTSTANDING. I even cooked them for die-hard southerners and the response was overwhelming. Thank you Sylvia! I bought this book knowing that more than just Amazon reviewers complained about the recipes. I think the biscuits came out horrible because she uses lard in hers but didn't want to let it out. I still made her peach cobbler filling though, and used the Yellow Farmhouse cookbook for the dumplings over it, and it was excellent, served with home-whipped cream. I don't dare try most of the other recipes, as just looking at them isn't even appetizing. But those collards ... WOW!"
3,Don't know what to make of it!,"Sylvia's Soul Food cookbook should have been more detailed particularly with pictures of the recipes' outcome. For someone like me, I'm a novice in the kitchen. Since I have been dying to go to Sylvia's Soul Food restaurant in Harlem, New York for the longest time, I thought this book would be a nice read but I have mixed results. The book is quite bland in style. I hope that her other books would show colored photographs or illustrations in showing the result. Since I'm not a cook, it's hard to say if the recipes would work or not."
2,"DON""T WASTE YOUR MONEY!","I bought this book years ago and regretted it immediately. They recipes are ridiculously unflavorful. Why write a cookbook if you don't really want to share your recipes? I kept the book only because I hate to throw my cookbooks out and maybe I hope one day I'll find something I could enjoy in it. The peach cobbler recipe is ok but even it needs tweaking and she advises using half peaches and I hate huge peaches in my cobbler. So I use sliced.I was very disgusted that she would rip us off this way. I ate in her restuarant in 2002 and was not impressed then either. It was not bad but definitely not delicious either. Even if she comes out with another cookbook, I've lost my trust with this one. Anyone who gives this 5 stars doesn't know jack."
1,What is this???,One word...H-O-R-R-I-B-L-E...these are not the recipes used at her restaurant...Mac and Cheese was absolutely disgusting...
3,Test recipes before serving to guests,"Mrs. Woods' book offers some real gems - those biscuits and that pound cake, for example. It is risky business, though, to prepare the recipes as directed - they usually require much tweaking and additional flavor. I hope that is not really the barbecue sauce for the world-famous ribs - when I made it here at home, it was thin and flat. The pound cake is delicious - but DO NOT try to bake that huge cake in a 9"" loaf pan - a 10"" tube pan bakes it nicely. I really wanted to trust this book, but Mrs. Woods obviously shares her secrets as grudgingly and as vaguely as most good cooks."
2,No secret recipes shared here,"As a soul food cook and a person who has eaten at Sylvia's, I can assure anyone that Sylvia shares none of her secrets in this book. This book lacks creativity and instructs to season with salt and pepper only. Any good soul food cook knows that seasoning is the key to great taste and one must season with much more than just salt and pepper. Better book choices with soul food recipes include the ""Essence Great Cooking"" cookbook as well as the tried and true ""Ebony Cookbook."" Also see juanthom11's listmania list ""Burnin' Soulfood Cookbooks."""
1,please do not waste your money !!!!,"I have had the pleasure of eating at Sylvia's in Harlem and the food is wonderful I love it,but this cookbook is horrible. The recipes in here are not the one's she uses in the restaurant if they were she would not be in biz. I realize that she does not want to give her secrets away but please do not give people the impression that these are the original recipes because you no they are not. I wasted my money not only on this book but on the food I bought trying to make the recipes. Sorry Slyvia but this one is not cutting it."
1,Poorly Cast and substandard production,"This movie was slow, poorly acted and scripted and boring. The ""plot"" meandered on and on without redeeming qualities whatsoever. Perhaps that appeals to some people, but I destroyed my copy. It was a waste of money."
5,This One's A Keeper... Great Show,"Beautifully acted, this delightfully different story had me spellbound. I couldn't look away for a minute. Great soundtrack. Magnificent performances and dialogue. Perfect sets. This show has a deep quirky-ness that intrigues.You become one with the story; it's THAT good."
2,This boat sinks!,"Adapted from the Off-Broadway play and filled with a solid cast of veteran character actors, this disjointed and quirky film never really gets any footing and flounders to an unspectacular ending.Many Indie films feature odd and quirky characters and situations not usually found in mainstream films --- and this is typically a good thing. Unfortunately, the pace in ""Jack Goes Boating"" is so slow and deliberate that any unique character traits and situations become mired in the muddy text and lack of activity.It's a shame that Philip Seymour Hoffman had to make his directoriral debut with this stinker of a film. Also, he has played the forlorn sad sack too many times and therefore has nothing we haven't seen him do before with this character of Jack. The film's title references the lead characters ability to overcome his fears and face new things in life. Regretably, after sitting through 91 minutes of this film, you won't care."
1,"Jack Goes Boating, I went to sleep","Jack and Connie are two seemingly lost souls who find each other in the hustle and bustle of the city.I got that much. After that, I was lost. JACK GOES BOATING didn't hold my attention, it was definitely a film for bigger and more prestigious minds that the one I possess. With an R rating, I would not allow children under 17 to watch.For me, this was not a film I will ever watch again.Natalie S. for Amazon Vine"
2,Left not knowing what to think,"I enjoy a good movie now and then, and when I read the plot of this movie I was looking forward to seeing it. I love romance movies, so when I read that it was about two people looking for love and being set up with each other by friends, I was excited about watching it. As I began to watch it, it became more and more difficult to keep track of the actual plot. There was a lot of going from seeing inside the thoughts of Jack to seeing what was going on while watching his thoughts. I did not appreciate the purchase of drugs or the use of them being shown in the movie. I was mostly disappointed by both the acting and the overall plot because when seeing the star cast I expected more of them. Seemed to be a C-List movie made by A-list actors."
2,"fair, but not enough to keep me awake","I watched this because I like Hoffman - he was okay (not great) and the rest of the cast were boring. Its one of those movies, I just couldn't get interested in"
2,Don't Watch on a First Date!!!,"Even at 84 minutes this movie was slow and boring. You would think the Director Philip Seymour Hoffman would have required the main character played by Philip Seymour Hoffman do a better job with his hair in the movie! How ironic the two male leads are doing drugs and the apply for the MTA. Wait until they fail their drug test, won't go from driving a limo to driving a bus!!! Sad as one couple are breaking up another couple are finding each other. The only comic relief was Connie telling Jack that she though his was sexy!!! I guess there is a reason this was an off-broadway play and maybe the Producers of this movie should have left it off-Broadway! In the extras they even mentioned how some plays don't make it onto film, how prophetic you are about this film. It just doesn't make it on film."
2,DREARY,"I'm not sure what the other reviewers find so amusing about this film, to me it seemed very dreary and depressing. The acting is top-notch and I really liked the characters, but definitely felt the story was a major bummer.If you are a big fan of Philip Seymour Hoffman, this DVD has some extras that detail how his original play went from the stage to the screen so it might be worth adding to your collection. If you haven't seen it before, though, give it a rent before purchasing to make sure you ""get"" the humor. Apparently I am just not on that wavelength!"
4,A film with Philip Seymour Hoffman written all over it,"Philip Seymour Hoffman makes his directorial debut with Jack Goes Boating. While watching this film it was easy to see the influence of Phillip Seymour Hoffman's personality and acting style in the characters and film's pace, mood, and message. The dialogue and characters' mannerisms are humorous at times (especially the final date scene), although the film has an overall subtle melancholy running throughout. The film moves a bit slow, with a heavy focus on dialogue and the character's emotional states and self-esteem. The entire film has that eccentric feel of New York City.If you enjoy watching Philip Seymour Hoffman in his acting roles, then you'll enjoy this film. The characters are very unique and quirky. The story has a few unexpected happenings and the final scene will make you laugh."
3,"Different, interesting, enjoyable...","It was a new experience for me. If you don't know Black Sabbath yet, please, get away from here and go grab Master of Reality or Paranoid! You you're a fan, it might be interesting to taste this! There are really good songs like Anno Mundi, Jerusalem and The Sabbath Stones."
3,"Best of the Tony Martin era, for what it's worth","First, other than the presence of Tony Iommi, this album has nothing to do with classic Ozzy or even Dio era Sabbath. However, if you can get beyond that, it might actually grow on you, though this is not necessarily a good thing. I bought this after listening to ""Sabbath Stones"", a now discontinued greatist non-hits album from their ""Are they still around?"" era. Anyway, if you like real cheezeball metal, you'll like this. It's so completely irrelevant, it's actually somewhat enjoyable as background music. Just don't buy it expecting killer riffs. Better choices are the new Iommi album and ""Plastic Planet"" by G//Z/R, both of which have much more to to with the classic Black Sabbath sound."
5,"One of the best Sabbath albums, ever","This cd caught my attention a few years ago when a friend gave it to me. I was like many narrow minded people and couldn't accept a Sabbath without Ozzy. But as I listened to the cd I began to realize how tight of a sound it was. Everything is solid on this album especialy the singing of Tony Martin, the most underrated lead man for Sabbath. You cant compare this album to classics like Sabbath Bloody Sabbath because it just doesnt. You have to compare this album to quality. The quality is just as good as any Ozzy or Dio era albums. The album deserves at least a listen to one song. Highlights are Anno Mundi and Valhalla."
3,Could've been better.,"A cool album (love ""Anno Mundi"" and ""The Sabbath Stones""), but has some ""cracks"" and ""gaps"" here and there (as a whole album). Headless Cross is better, much more solid. My opinion."
1,"Terrible, Terrible album!!!","Please don't waste your money on a terrible Black Sabbath album that has only 1 original member, the desperate Tony Iommi. Although the Norse mythology is attractive, the songs are poorly written."
1,This is as bad as it gets,"Without a doubt, this is the worst album ever to bear the mighty Black Sabbath name. 'Feels Good to Me' was an extremely poor choice as a single. Tony Iommi can still rock and rule the doom metal world, but the songs were weak. I do not like the Tony Martin era at all, Cross Purposes is the only solid album they managed to do with Tony Martin."
1,Are you Kidding!?,"Look guys, I appreciate the real Sabbath fans trying to be objective about this but you are praising one big pile of ish! This album, for all intents and purposes, is horrible. Tony Iommi is the man but he isn't the man on this. There is nothing remotely cool about this album. Generic production, generic singer (Tony Martin, cmon, the guy drives a cab) and the song structure is nothing even close to vintage Sabbath. If you own all their other albums, you're gonna wind up buying this anyway but to the new kid looking to get into Sabbath, don't trust anything after 1975. After that, buyer beware. Tyr stinks, bottom line."
1,TYR More like TURD.,"C'mon people this album SUCKS! I love Sabbath and no I amnot one of those ""If it don't have Ozzy it's not Sabbathcrying kid"" but I just do not feel anything for this album.I like Martin,he is a very good singer and I feel The EternalIdol is a fantastic album. This however is flat too me.AnnoMundi and Valhalla are perhaps the best songs on here andthats sad for they are filler tunes at best.If you likeIommi solo projects than buy THE ETERNAL IDOL-HEADLESS CROSSand Seventh Star(though Stranger to love makes me ill)andstay away from this TURD.The fact Amazon does not sell thisanymore and you have to purchase from private dealers say'sit all. CAN YOU SEE ME-CAN YOU HEAR ME-CRYING BACK FOR MY5 BUCKS!"
4,very good!!!,"This is is refreshing album from BS, even though its price does not say so. It is full melody, good lyric, rythm. Tonny Martin sounds like Geoff Tate which is positive thing here. His voice upgrades BS. and opens new horizons for BS. Worthlike!!"
5,"NO OZZY OR DIO? SO WHAT, THIS ROCKS!","Instead, the vocalist here is Tony Martin, and he's arguably the finest singer Black Sabbath has ever had. Enough of these ignorant automatons stating ""this isn't the real Sabbath."" This is Sabbath alright...Iommi's still on the axe, and he's in top form here. His solos rip, and the late-Cozy Powell's drumming is exceptional. Neil Murray's bass lines aren't too shabby, either. All in all, a damn fine album featuring a Black Sabbath with an evolved sound. And for the price, you can't go wrong."
4,Mythological concept galore,"Well, this is the sort of Sabbath album you would never expect: a concept album. The weird thing about this concept album is that it dwells into Norse mythology. I always thought Tony Martin dealt more with myth and lore in his lyrics much like Ronnie James Dio. It's actually surprisingly good music, but you have to listen to it many times for it to finally sink in. ""Anno Mundi"" is a good track, as are the three that flow into each other: ""The Battle of TYR,"" ""Odin's Court,"" and ""Valhalla."" The best track on here has to be the ""Sabbath Stones"" and I absolutely dug the last minute of this song!"
4,"Valhalla, Here We Come!","""Tyr"" is not quite as wonderfully done as ""Headless Cross,"" but I still love this one. The reason I knocked the album down to four stars was because of two songs I felt really could have been somewhat better: ""Sabbath Stones"" and ""Odin's Court."" I am a fan of both bone-crunching death metal (my Slayer reviews) and great heavy metal, and I rank this album as a ""good 4."" I don't know why, but as soon as I heard ""Anno Mundi,"" I fell in love with the song, catapulting it to #5 on my top-ten list."
5,Oh my ... Sabbath of the Eighties was underrated,Fused reminded me that Sabbath of the eighties was not appreciated after Dio left and it is a shame. This is Iommi's masterwork. Martin shines on vocals and Powell is a monster on drums. A must for rock fans.
2,A disppointment..,"Quite a let down when you compare with other Sabbath albums..not just the ones from the Ozzy Era but also one's like Headless Cross.I have listened to it once or maybe twice since I picked it up but there's nothing that distinctly would qualify as heavy or the traditional Sabbath sound.The ones that I might say were better than the rest of the tracks were-AnnoMundi,The Battle of Tyr & Heaven in Black.This album for some reasons seems to have just come out for maybe want of a Sabbath album.I'll have to agree with the majority out here that if you're looking for a Sabbath album pick up anyone from the Ozz / Dio days or maybe go for Headless Cross(compared to this even Forbidden would sound better).Musically and lyrically speaking it's weak..almost like having a pint of beer with water..no buzz is what you get."
2,Flashes of Greatness,"Just flashes. Anno Mundi (4/5) being the best song here and what a great kick-off. The Sabbath Stones (3.5/5) is quite good also, but all the rest MAY grow on you, or in the case of tracks like 'Feels Good To Me' (0/5) they are throw-aways the first time you hear them. Sad too because the production is generally great. All the levels are in place, Tony sounds pretty good, it just comes down to the songs... they just don't amount to much making this more of an EP if you take out the good ones. If you are looking for life after Dio, there isn't much here. Better than Born Again for sure, but not even fit to tie Sabotages shoes."
2,The second worst Tony Martin album,"I'm rating it two stars not because this album is that bad, but because, comparing it to the other Tony Martin's Sabbath albums, this is the second worst by a large margin (""losing"" this distinction only to FORBIDDEN) Production values are high, but the songs and riffs are simply not memorable at all, they all mix with each other, the songs have no identity, it seems Iommi was really uninspired.Anyway, for such a low price and if you're a Sabbath completist, this is a good buy."
4,working for me,"I have melasma from my pregnancy and this product has worked well...it's not totally faded, but I can really tell a difference in my skin. I think it works best to let it sink in for about ten minutes and then apply your moisturizer."
1,no sun protection at all,this product didn't protect my skin under the sun. I used once then threw it away!
2,Get the Avotek ones!!,"I got three books from this ASA series and I couldn't be more dissapointed: compared to the Avotek core books these are kids books. Way less information, barely no photos, poorer drawings and diagrams... They are useless for me, an airplane maintenance student. I feel I have wasted my money and wished I had gotten the good'ol Avotek ones, which I already knew :(I would only recommend these as a light reading / introduction to what Part 147 really is about. Seriously, if you are into this business, Avotek is the real thing!"
1,No Game just puzzles,"I thought we were getting a game to play not just a series of lame puzzles.........very weak, even for a three year old."
5,Perfect fit.,This is a great way to mount a flag pole to the stern of a boat. It mounted perfect on our 1 inch pushpit and allows us to fly Old Glory with pride off the starboard stern of our sailing vessel.
4,Sort of Spellbound,"I bought this CD primarily for its title song, which I like very much. There were a few other tunes that were quite good and others just so so. The worst thing about this CD was that the jewel case refused to release the CD. I was afraid I would crack it before getting it out but I finally managed to do so. It will not be returned to the case."
4,Wonderfully eclectic sensibility; unique and deeply moving playing,"Take a Latin rhythm section and add a Hungarian immigrant with formal musical training and a love of Jazz and Gypsies. Then place in a recording studio in 1966 with a producer with the courage and deep pockets to let the music happen largely unplanned. Now add a touch of genius and a sprinkling of bad taste and you have Spellbinder. I have to say that I can easily forgive the vocal because it is so charming. It really is disarmingly silly. And the overdubs are out of place. BUT Spellbinder and Gypsies Queen are well worth the price of admission, and most of the other tunes are very moving as well. This is one of the most enjoyable, spontaneous and heartfelt guitar albums of the 60s. No, Gabor Szabo is not Jimi Hendrix or Johnny Smith. Let's say he is to Hendrix or Smith as Scriabin is to Brahms. It is a wild and magical trip complete with an occasional Hungarian guttural. Relax. Close your eyes. Let it happen. Take the trip."
5,Flizzzy Ridin High,"Memphis Rap is the best, And Playa Fly is #1. His Flows are so smooth and sweet. It all just goes together. I love ann am obsessed with all his music, I got all his albums and theres not a bad song on any of them. If you dont have any of his music, I seriously suggest getting some."
5,crown him,This album is on hit from track one to track 11. His music is some bumpin ass down south rap. This niggaz got flows.Three six mafia should be beggin him to rap with them again.Bill Chill has his vocals on hit too. this hole album is bout it.
4,A Flowin' N*gga',"I think Fly is a very talented rapper/artist. I don't really care for too much rap, but every since my boyfriend got me listening to Fly, I've been listen to more rap. My favorite songs are IBN and Nobody needs Nobody. I will just like to tell this talented young black man to keep up the good work and don't let no one discourage you, especially of something that you do well. May God continue to bless you. PEACE!"
3,p.beecher,this movie was ok. but watching it from an adult viewpoint its definately not for everyone. not realistic.. stuff that only happens in the movies
1,Like it,I very much like these movies and wanted them for future Christmases as often they stop showing them after a couple of years.
4,"The paper worked fine, but","Its hard to ship things that are 35 inches long with out some problems.A few of the pages had some crease in them, but the printer handled them fine.It would have been nice if the paper were heavier in weight."
5,Very Pleased,Ditto on the previous review. This Banner paper was better than expected - printed out lovely on my printer with plain paper setting and high quality color printout.The shipping was extremely fast and the packaging was so well done it was almost over the top. I would buy this paper again.
4,Good...But Not As Good As Their First Album,"I have been looking forward to this album for quite a long time...and when i first heard the first single, ""Gangsters & Thugs"", i was really looking forward to buying the album. when the day came for the release i rushed out and bought it...and now that i have listened to it a few times i can say it's good...but not as good as their first album...i do really enjoy songs like ""Gangsters & Thugs"" and ""American Guns"", but i just don't think thats enough to make this album better than their lasts. So if you're a fan of the transplants or punk...i do recomend u go out and buy this album...but just don't expect anything better than their last album."
1,holy crap,"maybe 3 so so songs and the rest is crap. i realize that this is not rancid or blink but i did expect something a little more musically sound than this coming from these guys. if you are thinking of buying this because you like what tim and travis do in their full time bands, dont. this is not punk(but then again, neither is blink anymore and rancid is teetering on the edge). anyway, take you money and donate it to the ""get rob aston out of music forever"" fund."
2,Not half as good as the first,"I agree with the majority of reviews I read, this album was a let-down. I really enjoyed the first one. But this album was just... I couldn't get into it I guess. No real flow in the songs. Too many rap cameos. I can listen to it but I always have to put in the old one to redeam my respect for the Transplants."
4,can somebody tell me the difference?,between the deluxe edition and the regular one besides one case is paper and one is plastic?
4,Indeed,"people classify Transplants as being Punk-hip hop crossover, but that's not what they really are. They are more like a genre that takes from punk, reggea, hard rock, soul,and Hip-Hop. They are mostly a punk band, though. This is a really enjoyable album, the only bad song is ""what i can't describe."" I recomend this album, but first buy a Rancid c.d."
1,Dreadful,"Ok so after 'Transplants' I was looking forward to the Transplants new release.The album 'Transplants' itself is one of my favourites in my huge collection. Its just great. There are some great tracks on there, most famously Diamonds and Guns of course, but also D.J D.J , infact the whole album is a joy.So why the hell is 'Haunted Cities' total crap . I dont understand it. To go from good to crap in a space of 3 or so years i dont get. The ONLY good track on this album is Gangsters and Thugs.. and even then that track name is kind of similair in name to the one above I have already mentioned. Listening to this album, I really do get the feeling that they 'couldnt be arsed making it' Well sorry guys, but I cant be arsed to listening to your tripe. Ill stick to 'Transplants' thankyou."
4,"Good, But Not As Good As The First","I thought that ""Haunted Cities"" was a god album, though its not as good as the first. As someone who enjoys all types of music all of the songs appealed to me, most noticably ""Doomsday""""Crash And Burn"" ""What I Can't Describe"" ""Hit The Fence"" ""I Want It All"" and ""American Guns"". Waiting for the release, I couldn't wait to hear what it would be like. I thinks its an awesome CD, but it can't compare through and through with the first one. The main difference, Rob's screaming is nowhere near as hardcore, and where the first album had themes everywhere from killing, passing loved ones, partying, life's problems, and backsabbing friends, you can't listen to a song on this new one that doesn't have to do with drugs, or killing.And did anyone else realize that it went from 15 to 12 songs?"
2,A Big Disappointment,"I love the first Transplants cd and couldn't wait for Haunted Cities to come out.........I will more reluctant for their 3rd release. Haunted Cities is too R & B and ""rapping"". It's not angry enough, and hard driving like their debut, which I listen to all the time. Track 4 is the worst."
1,Biggest let down of 2005!,"Wow, what happened to these guys? What was once a great side project has become a group of ""thugs"" who sing about nothing for an entire record.Everything loveable in the last album is not here: no creative crossover tracks, no guest stars that shine, and no lyrics with depth. There is just _nothing_ special about this record...it's predictable and BORING.I almost died laughing while listening to this album; the lyrics are simply absurd. Any person who is at all critical of music could not take this album seriously...All of the raving reviews must be by 15 yearolds with ears that are not mature enough to be critical. Just because Tim Armstrong made some great records in the past should not make you dumb groupies blind from how truly bad this record is. Avoid this record at all costs."
2,B-O-R-I-N-G,Review by Chris Conlan:Who needs Lunesta to fall asleep when you have the new Trasplants album? Track after track the album gets worse and worse. Tim sounds like he is about to fall asleep in a couple of the songs and the beats/melodies are very bland. There is not one song that sticks out or even can keep your interest. Haunted Cities sounds like they just went into the studio and threw something together in a day. Travis Barker couldn't even save this album.
4,Mixed emotions,"Ok...ok...I can see how some of you seasoned fans of Transplants, or just Tim Armstrong might be disappointed in this album. Honestly, when I first heard the record, my initial thought was that it is better than the first Transplants album....but as it progressed, it all began to sound the same. The whole ""I'm such a thug, and I can shoot you at anytime"" theme got pretty old. The album is worth a try for all of us longtime Rancid/Transplants fans...but, it may be wiser to just download the material and save your $$."
5,Delicious!,"These are absolutely amazing! I tried all the other kinder candies before, but never these. I'm glad I did, & I should have bought more!"
2,"Looked like a good quality part, but not ready to be installed out of the box.","While the materials used to make this part look good. It isn't ready to be installed on arrival. The brass pegs used to attach this part to the hand-brake are not pre-installed to the shoes. Unless you have proper equipment to do this right, this is not a good one to buy. I instead bought a comparable product from the local parts shop with this brass part pre-installed. I'll be returning these to Amazon. I believe this will be the first automobile part I return to Amazon."
2,Correction,I was not aware of the archaic use of 'intestine' to mean 'internal.' My bad. This was not the only instance of a wrong word being printed. I have found the Banner of Truth Trust edition more satisfying.
5,Great quality,Great quality and now I never worry about my Bass slipping. Product his sturdy rubber supports exactly where needed. Very glad I bought this stand.
5,Best stand under $100,"I started with the folding Hamilton stand (didn't we all?), bought a fancier metal stand that kept flopping around, and finally ended up with an Ingles. It's sturdy, fully adjustable, and stable to where you can put your nice fully carved instrument on it and walk away without worrying. And as another reviewer noted, when your instrument is on a stand you're much more likely to practice regularly than when it's lying on the floor zipped in its case. The only better stands I've seen are custom made wood stands that cost several hundred dollars."
4,Every bass player should have one,If you're a bass player you have got to have a stand. My bass is always at the ready for me to quickly grab and start playing. No more wrestling it in and out of the bag before and after practice. This stand is pretty sturdy and well suited for home use. The only issue I have is that the padded material covering the two bottom hooks started to break up right after I first started using the stand. It wasn't a big problem. I wrapped some soft cloth around the hooks and secured it with a few rubber bands - problem solved.
4,Does the job very well,"Holds my kids bass so the end pin stays out. Wish it were brown to match the furniture but hey I can always paint it if it bothers that much. Practically, it is vey effective and I keep it out of the normal traffic pattern in a corner (back wall) of family room. No worries at all."
1,Terrible photo printing,The quality of the reproduction of the photos in this book is terrible. A fuzzy mess. The publisher did the photographer a real disservice in reproducing his work in such a poor manner.
5,Any thing to do with the Simpsons is a must own!,"I love ""The Simpsons"" and anything to do with it. The Fifth season is one of the best seasons out of all the 16 seasons. I, along with my family agree that ""The Simpsons"" is one of the greatest TV shows of all time. No matter how old an episode is, we never stop laughing!"
3,Confusing DVD,"Don't know why but they changed the layout of the DVD from the previous seasons. It's very confusing.Otherwise, same good stuff, of course."
4,"One of the classic seasons, one of the funniest","The episode boy scouts N the hood with Earnest Borgnine, where Bart and Homer are on a river raft with Ned and his son? has one of the funniest bits of all time. its always deleted from the Simpsons on tv, so you can only get it on dvd.Ned Flanders is a great guy, but he starts whining. they are lost on a raft and Homer uses up all the water, Ned starts saying we're done diddly done for... done diddly doodly done diddly and Homer jumps up and says snap out of it Ned! and starts slapping him. It was the most Ive ever laughed at any Simpsons episode, yet its not shown on tv? Im sick of the recent Simpsons now, the writers ruined it, but I want this dvd because maybe sometime later Ill watch it."
5,I love the season,Apu who works at the Kwiki E-Mart convenient store gets busted for not selling fresh food. When a food droped on the ground he picked it up and put it on the shelf. Lisa is making her own dolls called Malibu Stacy. Also Homer goes into Outer Space but he's not famous for it.
5,Another fantastic season,"The Simpsons continued to blossom with season five. There are some fantastic scripts in this one, which led to animating situations (homage to the beatles) and places (deep space) that continued to expand the simpsons universe. It also engaged further in character exploration (you have an Apu episode in this one). Worth the price!"
4,yes!,"Simpson's are like my own family, minus the cat, dog, baby and little sister. Oh yeah, I'm from India! Keep the DVDs coming guys!jpg"
5,Hate the waiting!,"I love The Simpsons through Season 8. I wish we didn't have to wait an entire year between Season releases. I could do without the commentary and fancy menus - I just want the original, uncut episodes."
5,"homer, you're drooling on the mic again!",I have been watching the simpsons for a long time. its my favorite show. my favorite this season is rosebud. (bart rocks)
3,Great Programs - Substandard Packaging,"These discs are essential for any Simpsons fan, most everyone already knows this.However, the Canadian release of Season Five has decided to omit the die-cut window in the front cover and include additional French text on the cover and spine - as if any French Canadian would not understand 'The Simpsons' and need to see it spelled out as 'Les Simpsons'.As a result of this the fifth season packaging does not match uniformly with the other four seasons, which do have die-cut windows and no French. This is picky to be sure, but these are advertised as collector's sets and this is the sort of thing that is sure to annoy off your average collector. Order your set from the US instead."
5,Another Great Seaon,I have the first 5 seasons and Im gonna get every season cause the Simpsons is still a great show. I laugh with every episode that I watch. Gets better every time I watch them.
5,Problem With Disc 2,"I had this set since December 25th, and yet the $pringfield episode on Disc 2 is already having playback problems, if amazon is going to sell things that have playback problems, I will start buying my movies from a SC Best Buy, my mom says is the #1 store in DVD purchases. I have DVDs from that store that are about 1 1/2 old, and they still show no signs of playback problems. [...]"
2,rush2112,Some of the discs had alot of stratches on them. There were some freezes on the showings and skipped some scenses.
5,Mmmmmm.....great DVD!,"The Simpsons- The greatest TV cartoon show ever! My favoutite show for years and years! Fantasticlly charming animation, brilliant stories (Rosebud!), Danny Elfman's energetic score, Bart's pranks and Homer Simpson saying ""Doh!"" This is an essential addition to anyone's DVD collection."
5,Another Great Simpsons Season,This season is very good and funny. Since the DVD hasen't come out yet I don't know what the DVD looks like and can't explain what it has but you can be sure it's going to have extras and eggs. This season has 22 episodes. I recommend fans to buy this DVD when it comes out. In other words go buy it when it is released.
5,best season of all time,"This season is not only the pinnacle of the simpson's humor, but of humor in general. I've never seen or heard such rich comedy in my life. Nothing comes close, the only things that do are obvious rip offs. Seriously, its called simpson's humor, it was invented in the early nineties, and every decent sitcom since has used it. Unfortunately now the simpson's no longer do, but that's another review for another time."
5,Worth the wait...,"I just read that someone DOESN'T listen to the commentary on the Simpsons DVD's. That's just CRAZY! I have watched all of them with and without commentary, and believe me, it's well worth the wait! I've listened to A LOT of movie commentaries, and most of them are incredibly boring, but listening to Matt, Al, and Mike (and sometimes Conan, Lovitz, etc.) is SO entertaining! Be patient...it'll come soon!"
4,A TRUE TRIP TO DRAG CITY!!!,"THIS IS ONE GREAT CD THAT HAS ALL THE BEST CRUISIN SONGS ON IT, EXCEPT FOR ""HEY LITTLE COBRA"" BY THE RIP CHORDS. THEY INCLUDE PART ONE AND PART TWO OF THE BEACH BOYS' ""SHUT DOWN"", AND THEY INCLUDE REALLY CLASSIC SONGS BY THE CHEERS, MR. GASSER AND THE WEIRDOS,THE SPACEMEN, AND LOTS MORE!! A REALLY GREAT SUMMERTIME CD.--PETER A."
5,Love it!,"It's a great durable puzzle but what I really love is the image on the puzzle. Dinosaur, sea life and farm animal puzzles seem to dominate the children's puzzle market. This one is a great image that keeps my kids' attention."
5,Dalrymple is a genius,A masterpiece--but then nearly everything Dalrymple writes is. Moving and thought-provoking. Impeccable research and supple writing. A real must read!
3,The White Mughals,"William Dalrymple, Has researched this subject well. To read however I found it scatty and piecemeal, he deals with the christian influence on the changes in the relationship between The British and Indian's but does not tie it up.Nor does he deal with the relationship between the Board of the East India Company in the UK and the Admin in India in regard to his subject.For someone who has spent some time in India and is interested in seeing this part of of Anglo Indian history dealt with, the book is really quite disappointing."
2,Okay read....,Some of the stories were not very good and really short. Overall it was just okay! Liked that the stories were based in mn!
2,Disappointed,"I absolutely love William Kent Krueger's books and looked forward to this book as a way to find new mystery writers to enjoy. However, I was very disappointed and didn't even like the one written by Krueger. I think that the theme of having them all incorporate certain items into the story handicapped the writers."
5,Great chair!,I ordered this for my daughter for Christmas and was not disappointed! It's a fun and surprisingly comfie chair. The price was one of the best prices compared to Limited Two and PBKids. Free shipping made this deal even sweeter!!
3,Mi Pais Inventado,"Todo lo que escribe me gusta pero aunque es buena no es una de sus mejores novelas. En algunos capitulos me aburri, al principio la encontre un poco lenta."
2,Misleading Advertising,"These boots have ""faux"" or synthetic shearling, which make your feet pretty much rot. Don't buy these - they look great, but it is too much money for fake. Go for the Ugg or other real shearling boot."
4,"Quite good, especially for the money","Great value coffee here. It's a bit darker a roast than I prefer, so I might try the French Roast next time."
2,A Mixed Bag-Read the first half only!,"Both books are of the female abduction/submission scenario. 4 Stars first half, ZERO stars for second. Olivia, the heroine of the first novel is actually well written and develops the character as well as a delivers a reasonably well written series of sexual vignettes, numerous bondage/discipline scenes and some real eroticism. The second novel (Lucy) is an execrable piece of trash, again dealing with the female abduction/submission scenario. This portion of the book utilizes the time ""honored"" scenario of ""humiliate, beat, rape"" and then the ""beat the woman, then humiliate her"" followed by the usual violent rapine scenes. This part of the book is trash, written poorly and only worth shredding. Personally, I tossed it in the trash."
3,Good Introductory work,"As an introductory work, for basic uniform details for most of the participating NATO members, this book is a decent deal for an overview of NATO during the 1980's. However, the work is dated and is in serious need of a update. Would have also appreciated if Osprey had included more thorough TOEs. I also understand why Osprey chose not to include British and American forces in the book, but then it makes the title a bit misleading."
5,My son loved this book!,My son was thrilled with this book - he loves sharks and absolutely loved this book!
3,Kim Lankford is still gorgeous,"Not too bad, Kim Lankford is still gorgeous. Any chance of dvd release and another reunion."
2,Very Disappointed,"Bent has produced some eerily beatiful tracks that I've come to love. However, I just don't see anything in the songs on ""Intercept"". As another reviewer pointed out, this album goes in a decidedly different direction, and I decidedly don't like it!Bent's other albums seem to be filled with a beautiful, sublime emotion that is difficult to put words to. I find that feeling missing from ""Intercept"". I'm giving this album two stars instead of one because I like the first track (""Excercise 7"")"
4,Still Bent but not as Bendy,"I absolutely love this band. And yes gone are the wonderful wacky chilled out beauties they are known for. But I find with them there is always something that makes owning the album worth it. That one song that sends me and on this album it is Stay Out All Night. Wonderful. I also really like Leavin Me with the sample from Anne Murray. At moments they really sound ELOish but without Olivia Newton John unfortunately. Simon Lord is okay but he isn't Katty Heath.It isn't programmed to love that is for sure, or even Everlasting blink It is a strong enough musical effort. I for one hope they bring back some of the lovely melodies, strangeness, and sirens."
3,Good and Bad,"The Good: Attempting something different. Stay Out All Night and Waiting for You are excellent.The Bad: Sounds like Erasure had an influence, and it's the weakest effort from them. Even the Exercise is a bit muddy and erratic.Beautiful Otherness is still the best song."
2,A major disappointment from a fantastic group.,"This CD is profoundly disappointing. Gone are the wonderful, wacky, chill-out tunes like ""Donkeys in Heaven,"" or that song where the cat meows through it. Fully half the tracks here sound like Oasis outtakes, with a lead singer who'd be booed off a karaoke stage. Banal lyrics are repeated over and over again until you run screaming for the ""off"" button. Maybe three tracks are reminiscent of the Bent we know and love, but they're not worth wandering through the dross.I don't know what happened -- if, like with Wham!, the talented part of the group left -- but this is a major disappointment from a wonderful group."
1,WTF?!?,"This album is a total MESS...unfortunately, it can be too much of a shock when an artist evolves into something completely incomprehensible, and I most certainly DID NOT get this album at all. Needless to say I promptly got a refund..."
5,Very comfortable shoe,I've been wearing Asics exclusively for about 5 years now. The first couple of years for running and now for walking. They are consistently comfortable and don't require much of a break-in period. Highly recommend.
5,I love these shoes,This is my third pair of Asics Gel Kayano's. I don't think I'll ever buy a different type of running shoe. I can't say enough about the comfort of this running shoe!
4,For Asics fans,"I have worn Asics for years and this year splurged for this model -- immediately noticed a difference. These are really excellent running shoes -- well cushioned, supportive, light."
3,This book is not so good,"Look, if you have a Phd in English or Linguistics, then this book is the book for you. If,on the other hand,you want to learn a simple, slower-paced method to master English Syntax do not, I repeat, do not get this book. It often leaves the reader lost, and at times it is like trying to learn the rules of football by throwing a novice out in the middle of the field with no idea what to do next. Plus, the price is a little steep. There are many other options out there, so I urge you to at least search other grammar books. Good Luck"
2,"Maybe good for english teachers, but not for linguists","I got this book by mistake, when I was enrolling in a fairly intro-level linguistics course at my school. The book I needed was Syntax, by Andrew Carnie. The Carnie text was fascinating, and gave a good enough balance of depth and translations for laymen that I was able to keep up in the class (I'm not a wiz in this subject).Analyzing English Grammar, on the other hand, barely scratched the surface. I tried to use it as a supplemental study book, for which it proved useless, and I tried to read it for fun, but the large print and shallow treatment of the material left me feeling cheated. You could overview everything covered without actually buying an entire textbook; this one is a waste of space.It's pricey, too."
3,"um... well, okay","I too purchased this textbook for an upper-level undergrad course at my university. Let's just say I'm thrilled the class is over, and now I'm more than a little neurotic about my grammar.The instructor presented the material much better than did this text. However, there are charts within the text that condensed the information well.Perhaps I should have taken the reading assignments more seriously. This text vastly improved my understanding of clauses and the numerous types of verbs.If you need this book for a class, I wish you the best of luck. Talk to your instructor and ask lots of questions! The book is just supplemental."
5,High quality,This grill is the top of the line. If you love to grill with charcoal this is a grill for you. The money you spend on this is well worth it.
1,not what I expected,"I was very disappointed with the Tracks and Scats Encyclopedia because of the hand drawn tracks. Len boasts ""ample use of photographs and line drawings"" for identifying tracks. His photographs are of animals, of which I am familiar, and his line drawings are of the scat and tracks; disappointing because it was for authenticity of the scat and tracks that I purchased the book. I wanted actual pictures of tracks and scat, a representation of what I would see in the field, not something I would use in a greeting card or placemat. I would not recommend this book to anyone that has spent more than 2 days out-of-doors. I may actually donate this book to the high school library and buy a Peterson's Guide."
4,Has anyone actually read this book?,"Agreed, the book could benefit from good photos, and the publisher should never have let it reach print without them, but if you're looking for a factual reference to learning how to track wildlife, there's not one in print that's more comprehensive than The Encyclopedia of Tracks and Scats. Expert trackers will all tell you that beginners look for tracks, while experts read sign - sign that cannot be adequately illustrated in either a photo or a drawing. If you want a comic book, try Marvel or DC; if you want a hardcore tracking reference, this is the book for you."
5,replacement,"this is a replacement copy, have had this book for many many years, gave my original copy away. so i had to order myself a new copy"
1,A VERY POOR EXCUSE FOR A COFFEE MAKER!,"I purchased this coffee maker as a replacement for one that had lasted a couple of years and then died. This one lasted 35 days and would no longer heat water. When it worked, it was very difficult to keep the coffee warm enough for more than 15 minutes, even in the carafe. I would strongly recommend that you reconsider the purchase of this coffee maker."
1,Don't Buy It,"No matter how much I tried to correct it, the carafe leaked coffee every time you poured it. I returned it and purchased another coffee pot."
1,One of the worst products I've ever ordered.,"I didn't order this from Amazon but got it from another on-line retailer. This coffee maker now resides in the local dump. Both of the coffee mugs leaked slow leaks. The Carafe leaked so badly it barely held water. The coffee maker itself was cheap plastic. Extremely low tech device.Coffee is heated and then dispersed from two small tubes. If you want to use just one leaky coffee mug be sure to place it so both the tubes will drip into the leaky coffee mug. If you want two leaky mugs of coffee then be sure to position both leaky mugs so they each get their own tube to leak from.If you want a leaky Carafe, grab hold of the cheap plastic housing, turn it over and turn the cheap plastic knob on the back. This extends the cheap plastic housing a couple of inches so the leaky Carafe can fit under the two tubes. Now your ready to make a BIG mess !!!Did I mention this thing leaks?"
3,Does the job fine,"This is a fine little coffee maker. I was attracted by the dual spout feature that dispenses coffee right into two travel mugs. Personally though, I miss having a hot plate. The carafe just doesn't keep the coffee hot and warm coffee, just isn't the same. Fine for the price and great for the occasional drinker but not an ideal piece."
2,Stopped Working After 5 Months,I was so happy with this coffee maker when I purchased it from Amazon.com in June 2005. Then in November it happened. Only some of the water would come down into the stainless steel mug provided and the coffee maker would sputter and spit hot water all over the counter. Eventually steam would pour out of the top even though the lid was down. I gave it 2 stars only because of the design.
3,Dark Oak Finish Wood Home Office File Cabinet w/2 Drawers,Cabinet had a ding in the top where something had hit it. Made in China!
4,See what happens when...,"Reality TV and two of the best parody writers around collide.You get Castaway. This is what it looks like behind the scenes of those outrageous TV shows when they put together an unpredictable group and then insert their own people to influence the ratings and the outcome. However, things don't work out quite the way the network planned when their `plant' falls for one of the contestants.As always, Advocate and Fanatic hit the mark directly on with the outrageous humor of this book. It's an absolute riot from start to finish."
3,Maybe it's been too long...,"Let me begin by saying I love Advocate (aka Blayne Cooper) and Fanatic (Ryan Daly). I have read a lot of their fan fiction and would give most of it 6 stars on a 5 star scale. I was anxious to read Castaway when it appeared in my mailbox, so I grabbed a beer, curled up in my favorite chair and began to read. I was almost immediately disappointed.I realize this book is a spoof on Survivor. I also admit I have never been a fan of the show. However, I expected more from these gals. Maybe it's been too long since Survivor's debut year and the novelty has worn off. I don't know.I did enjoy the humor and wit, but the basic story was anemic. Fun for an afternoon, but this one didn't stick with me."
1,Badly researched and badly written,"I am a Maltese historian focusing on this period of Mediterranean history. I bought this book because it was cheap, and cheap it was.Look elsewhere if you want a truthful account of history. The Great Siege: Malta 1565, by Ernle Bradford is one of the best contemporary books around."
2,Not impartial.,"Mr. Pickles's scholarship aside, the dedication of this book and the afterward reveal a strong bias in favor of the Knights of Malta. The book is dedicated with gushing adoration to Mr. Pickles's father-in-law, who apparently was a modern member of that order. The afterword professes that chivalry lives on in the modern era, epitomized by the charitable works performed by the current members of the order. Mr. Pickles's personal enamour for chivalry in general and the Knights of Malta in particular cast doubt on the impartiality of his conclusions."
5,thumbs up,"A wonderful novel, that perhaps is not as wonderful as its reputation suggests. But nonetheless first-rate. It's what Dicken's books should be. And Thackery was rather brave in that his main character Beckey Sharp is a bi*ch. And not an endearing one like Scarlett O'Hara. But you still enjoy reading about her."
2,Regarding the Free Kindle Edition,"I stopped reading this free edition when I came to location 568. At this point of the ebook there is a section of repeated text - about six to ten paragraphs repeat. I was a little concerned that if this free edition contains repeats - does it also contain omissions? I'd hate to read this 12,000+ location ebook and wonder all along if I were missing important text.I decided to purchase the illustrated version offered by Art & Poetry Publishing. That ebook does not contain repeat text at the spot mentioned above and the illustrations are coming through nicely. Small, but a nice addition to the story.:-) I don't work for Art & Poetry Publishing - I just feel a solid ebook file is necessary, even when it's free.Jenna"
5,Biting satire on life in early 19th Century England,"""Vanity Fair"" is Thackeray's masterpiece and on a par with the best of Dickens' work. Alternating deftly between tragedy and comedy, it is a story rich in character development and historical accuracy. The famous pre-Waterloo ball given by the Duchess of Richmond is described in detail and is one of the highlights of the book. Becky Sharp is certainly a model for all the other treacherous femme fatales that follow her in literature, particularly Scarlett O'Hara. ""Vanity Fair"" is undoubtedly one of the great works of the 1900's and it has surely stood the test of time. It may be ""A Novel Without a Hero"" but its characters are real flesh and blood human beings."
1,Don't Buy - Words Run Together...,"This book is not properly formatted for the Kindle 3 and several of the words run together (i.e. severalofthewordsruntogether). If you are seriously interested in reading this novel, buy a version from a different publisher. Amazon is going to notify the publisher and with hope this problem will be corrected sometime in the future, but do not look for it to be corrected anytime soon."
4,Despite dated writing style characters are timeless.,writing style is dated. His descriptions of his characters and his portrayal of their flaws and good points is timeless..
1,Fixed font,"This version uses a fixed font that causes inappropriate line breaks, making the book difficult to read on my Kindle. For example, some lines have only one word. I returned the book to Amazon for a refund."
4,Thackeray's Vanity Fair: The Victorian Society,"When I read the book I got the impression that I was given a unique oportunity to look at the Victorian society and recognise the things that were both good and bad about it. The novel is ""without a hero"", as Thackeray proclaims, but it is about the life and development of two women Becky Sharp and Amelia Sedley. By comparing and contrasting the two of them, Thackeray manages to show his readers that society in the Victorian Era influenced the development of the character of his heros, but not to the point of actually making them what they turn out to be. It is a wonderful book, full of insight and ever so true for our own time as well. If you want to know many truths about the Victorians and their lives, that's the book to read... You will, undoubtedly, enjoy the experience"
3,Classic for the sake of classic,"Vanity Fair is an important book. Its implications about feminism, greed, lust, and manipulation were prevelent then and are prevelent today. The book has doubtlessly provided a model for many modern satires, and thus there are many modern books that are much easier to relate to. Read this one because it is a classic, not becuase you want a good beach book. If you don't take time to absorb the period wit and atmosphere, you might as well read something else."
2,On the abridged audio version,"The abridged audio version of this book boils 800+ pages down to 3 cassettes, which results in a recitation of the plot with little characterization, historical background or social context. The reader was very good however, and if she does the unabridged version I'd opt for that one."
4,"A nice book, I think.","Rebecca Sharp, although charming and witty, isn't born into the nobility of England. But she is determined that she will become part of it before she dies. Her best frinde, Amelia Sedley, has a sweet and gentle neture. Her only ambition is to be married to a handsome army officer called George Osborne. However, Rebecca flirts with George eben when he is marrived to Amelia. Will the friendship of these girls last ?This book is quite interesting and attractive, but the beginning is quite boring. I also think that their are too many names in the beginning and this make me confused. I need to read for more times to get the meaning. But this is a nice book for us to read during spare time."
1,Book condition,"Book was sold as ""good"" condition, and priced somewhat higher than other editions. When I rec'd it, I found it heavily underlined, and should have been rated only ""fair"" at 30% lower price."
1,Not good to me.,"I read a lot of the reviews & can't help wondering, were we all reading the same book? There were a few I agreed with, in that I found this book so boring & the narration was so long & full of nothing that it was like someone just rambling on & on. I normally spent a good 4 to 6 hours a day reading on my Kindle. But this story did not motivate me to pick up my Kindle much so I read it about 1 hour each day, until I couldn't take it anymore. I was forcing myself to read this book, when normally I have to force myself to put the Kindle down. That is when I have found a good story that has grabbed me in the first few pages. This book was like forcing myself to swallow a huge bitter pill. Maybe I missed something, so hey, take the advice of the 5 star reviewers & read it for yourself."
3,"Disappointing and dull for a ""masterpiece""","I was excited to dive into this long British classic, thinking I was possibly in for another Middlemarch, which I loved. The first section is fantastic, when we meet the girls and they leave boarding school and go to Vauxhall. But after that, it just dragged and dragged. We don't get nearly enough of feisty Becky, and instead it's all boring side stories about Bute Crawley and the entire extended family. It took forever to read and -- as I approach the last 20 pages -- I can't say what I really got from it. Sorry."
2,Vanity Fair,I think that Vanity is the most boring book I have ever read It has absolutly no meaning.
2,Get on with it!,"While interesting, I found this to be a laborious read. The first 135 pages are spent setting the scene and building atmosphere, thereby setting the pace for the whole novel."
4,Worth reading more than once,"Hmmm, somehow, I feel that when Thackeray abuses Amelia as bland and soppy, he is only playing devil's advocate, and she is really his idea of the perfect woman. Becky Sharp grabbed me from the beginning with her rebellious spirit, and I think it is only pure Victorianism that she ends up....well, the way the novel ends, she's obviously on her way down.But as for the novel in general, it's a soap opera that keeps you tearing your hair out, because everytime you are waiting with your jaw hanging to find out what happens to character A, Thackeray suddenly switches to the storyline with character B, or off on one of his little side discussions of his club buddies or something. There's no better way to maintain suspense! The many humorous bits, especially Jos Sedley :o) , add to the books considerable charm.Boring? Never!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Seiko Men's SLC 028 Two-Tone,"I can not comment about the watch because the watch I recd. looked as if someone used it for a good period of time and then returned to Amazon. The box it was sitting in was also not like fresh looking, my heart broke to see the condition of the watch and the box and even though I had liked the picture and features of the watch but I could not keep it in the way I recd. it, hence I returned the watch by next post. So it's not about the watch folks."
2,Great watch but expensive price on Amazon,"I have had one of these watches for many years and like another poster would probably buy another if mine failed. I have had 3 or 4 crystals replaced, as they seem to scratch easily but I like the look and feel of the band. It keeps good time, though the date window is a bit small.But I think that paying $200+ for one of these is nuts. Citizen turns out watches just like these that sell all over the planet for 1/4 that price. I think that I bought mine for around $150.It's a great watch but a lousy price. Check with your local Seiko retailer (like a jewelry store). They are dead these days and would love to sell you a watch for a few bucks over cost."
3,Great album,"I bought the album on a whim when it first came out in 1995. I've enjoyed the music for the last 8 years, it's great stuff. Hard driving rock and roll, good solo materials & powerful vocals. They don't have many ""hooks"" per-say, but every song has it's own flavor & I can easily listen to it twice in a row without getting bored with it. If you find a cheap copy, pick it up and take a listen, you'll probably ejoy it if you like 90's rock. Also check out the band ""Nothing Said"" (...)"
4,Very interesting,We watched this on the history channel. It's fun to watch it again. There is so much information. Takes several times of watching it to absorb all the info.
5,Check it out!,"I have personally used this book many times at work to find the meaning of Samoan words. It is written very well, with all of the diacritical marks - including the okina (glottal stop) and kahako (macron), to allow for correct pronounciation. The book is beautifully bound in a neat hard cover, with burgundy red as the main colour, and with a yellow flower motif running down the side, and a yellow title line, ""Samoan Dictionary"".Go check it out! Its worth the price. Soifua!-Kaliko Trapp, Hilo, Hawaii"
5,Better than i thought it would be,"I don't know the quality of other mattresses in the market, but this one is much better than I thought it would be - its thick, sturdy, delivered on time and was packed really well. I would highly recommend this mattress for the price I paid"
5,A must for any Christian's library,This really is a must have for your library. Although this is a popular text for the seminary level Systematic Theology course it is extremely readable. Reymond follows the Westminter Confession of faith and builds on each chapter showing contemporary arguments from the various proponents of divergent views. Well written and well organized!
3,Not every one loves Reymond,"Having read the longer reviews on this site, I have to agree that there are some serious flaws in this book concerning Dr. Reymond's rejection of Nicene trinitarianism. However, those who can recognize these errors can benefit greatly from this volume.For instance, his presentation of presuppositional apologetics is one of the clearest in print. Part three--""Our 'So Great Salvation'"" is worth the price of the book, especially the section on the unity of the covenant of grace. And his defense of Calvinism, particularly limited atonement, is without peer. While I can't recommend this book without reservation, I can tell you that if you read it with discernment, you won't be sorry you bought it."
5,Great enjoyment,"Just beautiful and easy to enjoy. Beautiful music and exceptional staging, dancing and costumes. A great addition to the various Cinderella based creations, like Prokofiev's ballet, Rossini's opera (La Cenerentola) and obviosuly Disney's movie. A great way to introduce children to various music art forms!"
3,chess with characters,"Kasting's writing is highly engaging and his vision of the distopian near-future, though published years ago, seems very apt again. The fact that internalized and externalized homophobia should remain unchanged and foremost through a nuclear disaster is made easily believable.His story held me in thrall throughout and his settings stayed with me after the reading. It's nice to have a musician and a karate expert as the central characters, emphasizing the energetic and spiritual forces as embodied by Leo and Rafael.Finally, though, the book reads a bit like a chess game -- sacrifice so many pawns, exchange the rook for the bishop, the queen ... it plays painfully on the fact that fiction is ""not real"" -- and the characters never quite emerge from being game pieces which is too bad. Because they almost became people one could care about."
5,Fantastic Book!,"This book is a fantastic introduction to and reference to stats in genetics (I bought it for a genetic epidemiology course). Sham works through the concepts with enough detail that you aren't wondering what is going on, but so that you aren't bored either. The explanations are clear, the writing is excellent and the organization of the book can't be beat. Highly recommended."
2,125 best cupcake recipies,"there are a lot of original and wonderful flavor ideas. many of the recipies are quite pricey to make due to the liberal use of dutch cocao powder. the basic cake recipie on which most of the cupcakes are based makes a rather dry cake that has a rough texture. the basic frosting recipie is too dense. i like the flavors but not the recipies. i have adapted the basic cake and frosting recipie making the end products much lighter and airier, with good results."
5,A great addition to your cookbook collection,"If only for the inspiration, this book is a winner. The recipes are simple, clearly written, and look amazing. For the most part the ingredients are things I usually have in the cupboard, so delicious ""scrath"" cupcakes are now always less than an hour away. I will never use a mix again. There's no excuse to when these recipes are so easy.Last night I had to make cupcakes for a bake sale but had been unhappy with the frosting I'd previously used for that particular recipe. So I pulled out this book with it's variety if icings, and voila! the perfect match to raspberry cupcakes: vanilla cream frosting. It's like a normal buttercream, but the addition of whipping cream instead of milk makes it light, smooth and melt in your mouth buttery delicious!My cookbook standard is if I can get at least one recipe I'll use over and over, it's worth whatever I paid for the book. As someone who loves to bake, I get the feeling I'll more than get my money's worth!"
5,This was a great book!,"This is my third cook book from J.Hasson and I love them. They are easy to read, very personable, and the idea's are great. The recipes are simple to prepare. Our favorite so far is the Orange Chocolate Cupcakes, followed by the Candy Bar Cupcakes. The Halloween leftover idea is perfect!"
4,Fun Cupcake Book!,"I have been having a good time trying the different recipes in the book. Everything is from scratch, but the recipes are practical and once you have the basic ingredients there are many different recipes that you will be able to try without a trip to the market. This would be a nice book for someone teaching a young person how to cook!"
1,No Good Recipes,"I've tried two cupcake recipes and three frosting recipes from this book. The frosting recipes were only OK after I added milk - they wouldn't come together, and certainly wouldn't have spread otherwise. Both cupcake recipes were terrible. They just didn't taste like cake. The flavor and the texture were just off for both of them. I really don't trust any of the recipes in this book."
4,Great Book for Baking,"I love this cookbook. It has so many wonderful recipes. (cookies and cream cupcakes and frosting, chocolate mint cupcakes, etc.) My only complaint is the only chocolate frosting recipe has chocolate liqueor in it and maybe I made it wrong but it was really thick. Every cupcake I have made is so yummy and easy! I would buy more of her cookbooks because the recipes are so easy to follow."
5,My bible.,"I love this recipe book, I use it all the time. The Best Chocolate Cupcakes and the French Toast Cupcakes are amazing."
5,Great for beginners!,"Bought this book when I first learned to bake. Easy to follow instructions and so far, none of the recipes failed me yet."
1,BO RIN G G G,"this book is boring , pictures, colorless, cheap print, i would not recommend this to any of my friends! :("
2,Did she try ALL of these before writing?,"I just made the Pink Lemonade cupcakes... page 107. WOW. they were AWFUL. Not nearly enough flour. I am hesitant to give anything else a try in this book! this totally wasted 3 hours of my time.I wonder if she actually tried all of them... I know some of the recipes appear to be winners... but there are definitely some bad ones... ""lemons"" if you will."
1,NOT a direct fit,I ended up having to take it to a muffler shop to have pipes bent and to flare the inlets and outlet of the muffler
3,THA SONGS,I really love owning the original movie soundtrack to Enter the Dragon but I really do wish that every single piece of music would be included on the album. Most of the score is included but they need more
3,"Not Bad, Could Be Better","This is not a bad overview for a newbie project manager, but it tries to cover a lot of ground in a small area so essentially each point is only given a paragraph or two. Because of this, not much context is provided or a discussion of various situations that may arise. This is much more like one version of the ""what"" and not much of the ""how""."
3,Project Management 101,"This book is great for those unfamiliar with the fundamentals of project management and in need of a quick and easy guide designed to acquaint you with the basics. Also, for those working in project management, it is a good refresher of the essentials.The basic outline is as follows:1. The basics2. Planning3. Execution4. Reviewing progress5. Making changesA nice feature of this book includes a self-assessment at the end, so you can evaluate how you rate based on your past practices and the knowledge gained from reading the book."
3,"Nice chair, not true to color","This is a nice chair, the color is not beige in the traditional sense. It is more of a salmon color. It is an ok chair, the padding is not very thick, and gets a bit uncomfotable after a certain amount of time. Price was great. Chair is good, just not what I thought."
5,One Touch Ultra Glucose Control Solution,This is the only product for testing One Touch Glucose meters. It does what it's advertised to do.
5,Does what it is supposed to do,"I recently had to start monitoring my blood glucose level and I selected the OneTouch Ultra2 meter. As part of the measurement routine, you are supposed to periodically verify that the meter is within the measurement tolerance. That's the job of this control solution. Instead of analyzing a drop of blood, this solution is applied to the test strip and the reading should fall within a pre-determined range as printed on the bottle containing the test strips. My current batch of strips says the control range is ""120 to 160 mg/dl"" and the meter read 127. I don't think I'll ever use up all two vials of this control solution before the expiration date (12/2013); one would have been more than enough."
2,A collector item,Don't miss this one. Soon it will not be there and it will not happen again. One of the best.
5,an oldie but a goodie,"This cd reeks of rodeo and the west. It's Chris in his native element. I don't think many did story songs quite as Chris has and this cd is missing only the dirt in your teeth as the wind 'blows away another part of Colorado' and the rattle of the innards at the jump of ""them bareback horses"". Easy driving music - awesome cd before Nashville."
4,Full circle,"A fascinating look at how Siberian shamanic practices fit into the work of psychiatry. I always love it when two seemingly unconnected parts of the world slide together, especially in the world of medicine and healing. Suddenly we realise that we were talking about the same truths in the first place, only we approached it from different directions.I would like to honour Olga for her bravery in setting her experiences down on paper in order to share more healing with the world"
3,"Get Excited, then learn elsewhere","Like the Celistine prophecies, this book does well to inspire the reader. It is a fascinating read but runs the risk of overplaying the glamour at the expense of ""What now?""Knowing secrets does not lead to living them. Also one requires a context for this way of living, since it is not some bolt-on to your life.More practical books like ""Shadows in the Twilight: Converstations with a shaman"" by Lujan Matus provide context for the modern person who seeks the evolution shamanism promisses and that needs to be earned through committed living."
5,On the grass in the sun - Suddenly in Siberia on a non-moving bus - And then all the way home again.,Worth more than one read. Awakening to the spirit. This book took me from behind my desk in the corporate software development world into the spirit world of shamanic. It opened my eyes and heart to the sublte work done by people who work from the matured instinctual place that guides people who in crisis are beyond the excuses of intelectual safety and in desperate need of the real change. Thank you Olga.
3,Where is the focal point of life?,"Healer, Shaman, Hunter, Warrior, Magus, Messengeror Executor...which are you?This book reveals one woman's journey towards theancient religions of Siberia, believed by some tobe the cradle of all religion. The mountains ofBelovodia have many names and may be the sacred peaks of Buddhism, Zoroastrism and many others. In these mountains Olga Kharitidi found her spiritual identity and was taught about her inner being.The author does not try to persuade you that you must believe all she says. It reports one woman'sjourney of the heart and allows you to decide foryouself. More importantly, it tells how she has been able to blend her spiritual life with her practical life as a psychiatrist in a Siberian hospital. The blending and balance of spiritual and physical is a lesson that deserves our attention."
4,entering the circle,I found the book very intresting .I don't belive evrething that is siad but it is a diffrent piont of view.
5,"The only fin to use, period.","Viper surfing fins are simply the best bodysurfing or bodyboarding fin on the market. This is the fin used by the best watermen, lifeguards, bodysurfers and bodyboarders in the world. They are designed to provide the maximum thrust from each kick to propell you into every wave you want to catch. I have used these fins for almost 20 years at the Wedge, Pipeline, Teahupoo, and many other heavy bodysurfing spots. I used these fins all duing my years as a lifeguard and have saved many peoples lives wearing them. I always pack a pair in my board bag and have taken Vipers all over the world to swim, surf and dive with.Don't risk your life with anything else... Vipers are tools not toys!"
5,It's like cheating in the surf,"I grew up in Hawaii and am stationed here now with the military. I've used many different fins over the years (I'm 42 y/o so I've tried a lot). Without question these V7 fins propel me through the water better than anything I've tried. The first day out with my buddy (we each bought a pair) he turned to me and said he felt like we were cheating :). We caught triple the waves we normally would have with our other fins and current wasn't an issue. I've used them in waves up to 6 feet Hawaii scale (12 foot faces) and love them. They allow you to stay way ahead of the white water with a periodic kick while boarding. My only issue is that they're made of such rugid/thick material it rubbed the outside of my ankle and cut it a bit after two hours in the water. Got a fin sock and all is good now. They are a bit expensive, but there is a reason. You're getting what you paid for."
1,Warning! NOT Captioned!,"For all purchasers that have hearing disability and rely on captioned movies like I do, don't buy this like I did. DVD was created in 2007, yet not captioned per 1993 federal mandates for all movies for public viewing. Very disappointed at being excluded from watching this movie!"
5,A Favorite,"I have been looking for A Boyfriend for Christmas for a while now, it is a favorite on Hallmark around Christmas time. I was so happy to find it here, and the price was good, thanks!"
4,xmas romances,Very cute and fun to watch. Steve Guttenberg is a fun Santa and makes the season a verry merry and happy Christmas.
5,a cd for any guitar player...this was a guitar Master,"Carlos Paredes was a very talented guitar player with lots of soul.....He plays this wonderfull traditional guitar of 12 strings like noone else...mainly this guitar is used on ""Fado"" (dark and missing lyrics songs)He is famouse because of this song ""Verdes Anos"" and i have to say it's worth this all album!From what i've heard this cd was offered to Ben Harper in one of his shows here and he got blown away!!!Rest in peace Carlos..your music will live forever"
5,"Different, and Outstanding","Carlos Paredes was phenomenal.Paredes, who died in 2004, was Portuguese. His instrument was the Portuguese guitar. If you want to know about the Portuguese guitar, the liner notes being unhelpful, you have to do a little research. It turns out that the instrument has twelve steel strings, strung in six courses comprising two strings each, and has a distinctive tuning mechanism.The tunes on this album, the arrangements, and the performances are all wonderful. Since nobody else is credited with any of these, apparently they are all Paredes.I wish I had the vocabulary to describe this music. You had best sample it. All I can say is, I have quite a few guitar albums, including some I am very fond of by Andres Segovia, and this is like nothing else I have ever heard.It's no accident that this album has received nothing but five-star reviews."
5,Carlos Paredes Portugeuse Guitar,"First heard Carlos Paredes and his Guitarra Portugesa on ABC (Aust) Radio National and was blown away. The CD received was everything I had hoped for, there is something about Carlos' music which goes straight to my soul! I have always loved Spanish guitar but this CD has converted me to Portuguese. Maybe it is the vibrato and as well the notes are particularly clear. Whatever, I shall be buying more of Carlos Paredes work."
2,"Excellent service, not so excellent product.","The tool chest was flimsier and cheaper than we expected it to be. When we opened the box, some of the metal had bent/dented during shipping (back, and inside with the drawer holders). Of course, for the price, we aren't going to get a high quality chest, but I was hoping it would be a little sturdier than it is."
1,what the hell?,The item came damaged in multiple places. It was not packed correctly. The assembly instructions were vague and for the most part useless. I have a part that I can't figure out what it is for or does. the manufacturer's website doesnt seem to have the instructions anywhere or any additional info. The price was right but that's all.
4,"Short, Sweet, and Smart","As with the entire Penguin Lives series, this book was written by an expert who was given the challenge of sharing his knowledge in less than 200 pages. John Keegan succeeds brilliantly. As an expert on World War II, Keegan has written many wonderful and insightful books and this is no exception despite the literary constraints placed upon him. His clear and beautiful prose make the book a quick and enjoyable read, but he does not sacrifice information. I did not know a lot about Churchill before reading this book, but now I feel that I have a good understanding for his achievements and why he was so significant in his own time. It is a fabulous book for an amateur historian who does not want to spend dozens of hours wading through a biography several volumes long and simply wants to know significant events and some good analysis by a renowned historian. A wonderful, well written, and interesting book."
5,"""Blood, Toil, Tears and Sweat""","In 192 pages of superb prose John Keegan sketches the life and times of Winston Churchill. This little book belongs on the shelf of every person who reads the English language and has a fondness for liberty. Churchill was quite simply the greatest Englishman and orator in the last century, and this book tells his story exquisitely. Don't let the brevity put you off--this is a terrific biography."
2,Looks Can Be Deceiving,"This tool box is ""definitely not"" for the tradesman. Although it is a nice looking product, enhanced by the stainless steel body plates, it lacks the durability necessary for either on-the-job exposure, or the back of a pick-up truck. It makes a for a good ""home owner's"" tool tote."
3,Ok for at home use but not tradesperson worthy,The front clip broke off shortly after i started using it - now i just store tools in it at home. looks good but not sturdy
1,Adult Version of Jekyll & Hide,"I really liked the camera work to show the gender transformation. The blonde actress was gorgeous. I could not tell if the male Jekyll had knowledge of what was going on when he was his female alter ego. It seemed he had no control over Hide's actions. I was not a fan of Hide cutting off the Sailor's dick. That seemed random, and out of place. It is an older show, so don't expect high def film."
1,Carafe exploded!,Be careful with this carafe. I have been using mine 6 months and when using a metal fork to retrieve tea bags it exploded showering me with tiny shards of glass. VERY DANGEROUS!
5,Lyrical journey,"Mr. Pittalwala is a gifted writer and a keen observer of the individual spirit. I have never been a short story reader; I prefer losing myself in the pages and chapters of a novel. Dear Paramount Pictures changed that! With his perfectly chosen words and incredibly sensitive insights, Mr. Pittalwala magically captures sights, sounds, smells and emotions in his stories about a rich culture of India, both in that homeland and in the U.S. Each story took me into the hearts and minds of the characters, and leaving me satisfied that I have shared their secrets, fears, discoveries and resolves."
5,Excellent,A great book. A much needed easy read. Excellent stories and could relate to quite a few of them. Great humour with serious undertones.
2,Did not fit outlet,"Apparently many outlets in hotels are recessed and this converterdid not fit the socket. My son ended up tossing this out.Maybe with an extension cord it may have worked, not sure."
1,FAILED TO PERFORM AS DESCRIBED,"This is a 50 Watt converter, but when used with a 35 watt shaver it did not work, the shaver acted strange and would not perform, attempting to return."
1,does not fit,Does not fit Type E or Type F sockets. Makes it more or less useless in most places in Europe without an additional adapter.
3,It is beatable,I used WIKI strategy for a little help. Without a manual...this is unplayable. I had to find what items and where. I tried to beat the game quickly and get to the RUBIAS the main boss but I ended up being shy on adequate Armour. Sadly I found a code which gave me the highest items but the rest I did on my own. I took a lot of health with me to Rubias. I enjoy the fact that this game can be beat.
2,Room for improvement,"Although the book is helpful in providing close to the most accurate forms. It does however lack factual information for example concerning adoption records for the state of Mississippi. According to the State of Mississippi, adoption records are sealed. You cannot obtain any records unless you have a court order. If you are seeking adoption records of deceased persons, you will not be able to obtain them even if the records are beyond 1970. I was disappointed to know that I could not request certain records from different states. Some information was misleading or incorrect."
5,Vital,The Vital Records Handbook is indispensible for obtaining records from US States and foreign countries. The forms and directions are there and ready to go. I use it frequently to obtain records for genealogical research.
5,One of Paulsen's good ones,In my opinion Paulsen writes some great books and some so-so ones. This is one of the great ones for the description it gives of rural life and values and is tremendously evocative of a sense of place and time. I don't know if young people will have the same reaction but I'm going to give it to my eleven year old son and find out.
2,Popcorn days and buttermilk nights,"The book Popcorn days and buttermilk nights is sorrt of a good book.It is a sort of interesting book. i fell asleep one night when i was reading it. in some places it was interesting but it ran off alot.sincerely, nikki wiley"
5,Gold buckle dreams,"wonderful chris ledoux songs, such a true picture of rodeo life and antics. great songs,great presentation, very glad to have the cd"
3,disapointed,"We thought this was A little More Country Than That, By Easton Corbin. But it still has some good old songs on it. That was our falt!!"
1,Disappointed,"I bought it for one song (""Music in My Mother's House""). It's the only one on the album I liked."
5,artist-full hurricane!,"blonde redhead is the art-iest band out there. and sitting there reading this, you'd have to agree the songs they put together are simply mind blowing. everyone of their songs is a little huracane all on its' own. with *screach* guitars and loud and *in-your-fave* vocals, you'll have to get more and more each time."
3,SO So,"The paper looks great but...it is rather difficult to work with. I know another reviewed said it was great for flowers but its not as great as other papers. When trying to do certain folds it is almost impossible to get the foil to behave. The sheets curl up witch also make it hard to work with. Im not saying it doesn't look good though. It looks great very nice colors and textures, Im just saying unless your a pro at origami this paper is going to be a little tough to deal with. For 3.99 I am happy though."
5,"Cool book, great service","We had a conversation about the book with a friend while on vacation, went to the amazon.com site and found it at a great price. When we returned, the book had arrived. The Kindergarteners in my room have really enjoyed reading it!"
2,Very out of date.,"This book reads like it was written in 1990 and the author never bothered to do any further research. It makes some good points, but it should not be a first choice for a survey of the state of the art with regard to functional, OO, and logic programming."
3,60's Rock goes 70's Latin Disco,"I first heard this in the 70's. There are a couple great songs: ""Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood"" & ""Esmeralda Suite"" which really get you going. Of course the required cover of ""Gloria"" is here too. The rest is so so at best, but I can listen to the first two over and over. And by the way...I HATE DISCO!"
3,Disappointing transfer to CD,"After reading the reviews I was pumped to get this hot dance song from my high school days. Especially the fact that the first 2 songs were recorded to be continuous play like one long mix. That is how I heard it recently on XM radio. Imagine my disappointment when I played the disc and when it gets to the 2nd cut there is a second or two dead pause, sounds like an interruption. Some CD's indicate the track has changed but there is no interruption in the music if its a continuous play mix. Wish I hadn't wasted my money. I have a turntable so Im now searching for the vinyl record. The first and second songs should be considered a medley without the stupid cut in the middle of the music. Very distracting at best."
1,Don't Bother,There's only one song on this cd that's worth anything. Big disappointment so don't bother. I love latin music but this cd just doesn't make it.
4,CD replaces album,"Music is just as I remember it when I had the album. Only now, I can enjoy it in the car!"
5,Fantastic,"This is a classic. I could listen to ""Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood"" all day long. One of the best songs ever."
5,Definitely disco - The BEST example,"I must respectfully disagree with the first reviewer. This is definitely what I would classify as disco. And I was both a club goer in NYC and sometime DJ ""back in the day"". Contrary to popular belief, disco produced a lot of excellent music, and Santa Esmeralda is one of the reasons why. They were very hot in the clubs, and for good reason.If you want to know what the REAL disco music was like, circa 1977-1980 listen to this record."
3,Not as great as it sounds.,"I bought this program mainly for the 4 CDs. However, most of the ""on-site"" recordings are unclear, being too fast for the untrained ear. Plus, the narrator verbally repeats the written instructions for each exercise, and makes comments in english, meaning far more english than arabic is spoken on the disks. If you're a beginner looking to improve your oral comprehension, this is probably not it.On the plus side, there is a short lesson on arabic script at the end of each chapter."
1,Did this guy really go to Wake Forest?,"I went to Wake and recently graduated and this book is a little misguided. Not only are the school colors WRONG (hello-maybe a publishing error but come on!) but the quotes are silly and shallow. ""Girls wear pearls..., people are preppy..."" etc. Also, many of the author's descriptions are off the mark. Some things are accurate, however. For example, how you can always find a group you fit into, etc. If you are looking for info on Wake Forest, or any other school, don't buy these books. They are written by students and not written by professionals who interview students but actually confirm information. Get a credible guide book and go visit."
5,Love,I am learning a lot from these. I write sentences then one of my housemates that speaks Spanish checks them for me. It is really fun and it brings up lots of fun conversations when people come to visit.
4,I love it!,This kit is awesome! ...Magnetic Poetry - Spanish Kit (World Series)but sometimes can be difficult to form some sentences with irregular verbs in Spanish. I recommend it for a gift.
2,Introducing a Car Even More Grotesque than the Toyota Echo,"An incredibly ugly, demonically possessed 1971 Lincoln Town Car terrorizes a small town community in Utah, driving over most of its inhabitants. Unfortunately it never got to the director or screenwriter."
2,Bad acting and bad directing,"The acting is terrible in this movie, which I also blame on the director. About the only special effects in this movie is done by speeding up the film to try to give the illusion of speed, which looks terrible. This film was definitely done on a low budget and it shows. About the only thing worth watching in this film are the women who are wearing very tight pants.The overall plot is not bad though. In fact, I would like to see this film remade with some decent acting and direction, a substantial budget to create the special effects, and a little more substance added to the story.Overall, if you are bored with nothing to do, then watch this movie. Otherwise, your time and money is better spent somewhere else."
1,Can we say cheese??,"Automatically this movie gives off a typical seventies version of a horror movie, complete with skin tight jockey shorts, fading pastel colors and scooby doo hair doos. The beginning leads the viewer to believe that something evil is learking off in the distance, like a predator seeking it's prey. Yet how far can one go with a black car, with tinted windows who spends most of the movie gunning people down, off the roads. Never is there any evidence that someone is behind the wheel, for all the viewer knows it could be a 16 year old with a remote control out for kicks. It's VERY far fetched, and annyoing to watch, as no one is clever enough to just blow the stupid thing up, until the very end. Not to mention all the graded, loud music that sounds like someone scraping together pieces of metal...it's not enough for any true horror fan to stand for a whole hour and a half....not to mention there was never any hope for a sequel...""Car The Revenge??"" Give me a break!N.C."
1,Good for a few unintended laughs.,"This low-budget '70s popcorn flick is worth watching for sheer camp value, but unless you're less than eight years old don't expect horror or suspense. Or, for that matter, good acting, dialogue, cinematography or direction.Too bad cable's late, great ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" never got around to featuring this turkey. They could've had a lot of fun with it."
1,SILLY SILLY SILLY,"A mysterious car with no driver wrecks havic in a small town. However, no logical explanation is even given why the car has strange powers. To bad it didn't run over the person who did the screenplay."
4,better ending needed,"this movie was good from start to finish, but the ending was confusing to me. the cut i saw showed the car going off the cliff, the explosion & the deputies reeling in horror. heard the devils/ monsters face is shown -but not in the print i saw."
5,Movies I love...,"I had thought that I'd seen scary movies in my time, but this one really is a nail bitter...It starts off fast, then zooms through with a scare a minute...It's just a great film...Georgia"
3,"Fun, cheesy 70's horror flick","There is a maniac on the loose and he is behind the wheel. No, it is not your daily commute to work on the expressway...it is a black Lincoln that is terrorizing a town. James Brolin is the sheriff of this small desert town, a single dad with a feisty lady friend who verbally challenges The Car and saves the town's children. Ronny Cox is a deputy with a drinking problem, and The Car challenges his vows to stay off the sauce. Just when you think it is safe to leave your house, The Car always seems to know where you are and what your plans are..."
4,Satan's hod rod Lincoln,"I remember seeing this one alone late at night (in my parent's house with the big picture window facing the point where the road forks to bypass our house and car light shining into the darkened family room) when I was little and I watched most of it from under a blanket. I watched the DVD from under a blanket as well. Despite bad acting, a dumb script, and some looooong parts with no action, the movie really manages to create a sustained feeling of dread that never lets up until the (admittedly hokey) end. The cinemetography and special effects are great, and George Barris' Car is really menacing looking (See Barris TV & Movie Cars in books- it has a short section on it), and a better actor than most of the stock cast. Great, creepy fun."
5,Awesome Car,"I am very happy that I found this movie to order it, I have been looking for it in video stores for so long now, I remember when the movie first came out back in 1977, I saw it in the theater three times in a row and I also got to see it on television a couple of times, The movie the car is so intence and I just love the way it honks it's horn and the engine sounds like it is really high performance for racing, Also it looks like there is a face in the head lights, I also think that it's cool that it don't have any door handles and it's got bullet proof tires,Not firestones thats for sure, I'd like to own the Car Itself,Great Movie."
4,The Car,"I enjoy scarey movies, not gorey, but the movie keeps you involved.The movie has a good storey line, great actors.I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys old classic movies."
3,The Car,My husband had been searching for this movie forever. Delighted to find it I ordered it but upon watching it the movie freezes and skips in parts.
4,The Devil is in the car !,"This is an underrated movie. Ive seen this several times & own the DVD. A car - basically the devil in the car kills people in a small western town. James Brolin is the hero. Its really not a bad little horror movie as the car runs down people on bikes,pedestrians,etc. It is tense,moody & has a few scares. The car itself succeeds in having an evil aura when you see it. Easily worth a look - but dont expect an all time classic. Still very cool and better than Trucks :)I own the Anchor Bay DVD, but you cant go wrong with way with AB or Sony"
4,Available NEW from Amazon Germany : $12:99 Euro,"This movie is silly... I know. But , it's nostalgia and excitement and memories too. Either you can't help but love it.... or it is totally irrelevant to you. ""The Car"" represents ""B"" grade horror at its best with great special effects, humour, and that strange ""Jaws of the Road"" connection.Best of all.... it is available now for purchase from Amazon Germany. New fresh prints with English/ German/ and French soundtracks.I hesitate to recommend this German edition because it will probably re-appear in the USA soon enough; but perhaps not. There seems no rhyme or reason to some of the marketing decisions made concerning DVD releases. Personally, I have chosen to grab the new German edition while I can....."
4,Excellent suspense horror flick.,"The Car appealed to me because I'm always after a rare movie and this one was very hard to track down. This thrilling, action packed film is a 'must see movie' for fans who enjoyed similar movies such as Duel and Christine. It keeps you in suspense and with hardly a dull moment. A small flaw would be the lack of visual killing scenes. Other than that I definitely enjoyed it and I'm sure you would too."
5,This Movie Was Wicked,When I saw This Movie In The 70s I Thought It was the phantom Driving that lincoln and when it started kiling people i was like oh S*** who is behind the wheel of that lincoln and then i found out the hard way but man this movie is wicked
4,Some bad movies can really scare the hell out of you!,"I was only 7 when The Car first appeared in theaters. As a seven year old, this ugly black mean looking sedan with the devil's horn scared me so much, I wouldn't ride my bike in the street or sit in front of our picture living room window. As I got older I realized how awful the acting is and how amusing the storyline was.Released before Christine, The Car could not be destroyed, scratched, dented, so on. The front of the car looked like a sadistic face, with the headlights, the front fender and the silver grill. Even the engine sounded mean and frightening. The Car was the true star of the show. So if you're looking for a good fright without a believable story or great acting, The Car is for you."
3,look both ways before crossing the road,"I've seen this movie a really long time ago but for some reason still remember it even though it wasn't such a great movie . As a kid I thought at times it was very unbelivable , but lets face it , if you are going to make a movie about a killer car you should prepare to make some sacrafices like why all those pepoles insist on staying on the road when being cahsed by it when they can go sideway ?"
3,vintage movie watcher,"""The Car"" is well acted, lots of action, good acters and actresses; but is also packed with lots of foul language, very violent scenes, and is on the sinister side of movies. It's entertaining, and James Brolin plays his part very well. I don't recommend that kids be allowed to watch this movie that are under 13 years of age. It's an adult movie, with adult language, and does have adult sexual scenes."
4,Early cable cult classic finally on DVD!,"It seems like I'm not the only fan of this little gem of a movie. This wound up having a following because it was always on cable in the late 70s, and I hadn't seen it since.When I saw the DVD advertised, it was like finding an old toy in the attic.This took on a following just like ""Over the Edge"" did, because of cable. So that explains the excitement of some of the reviewers.This movie is a hoot, would be in your ""midnight at the drive in"" DVD collection, and a classic in its own right.There's not a lot to the story, good vs evil, possessed car, one of the cheesiest endings of all time but a lot of fun.I have a feeling if there is a remake, Paris Hilton will be in it, because the 2 girls who play Debbie and Marie are both sisters of her mom."
4,A guy movie!,My husband loves this movie as well as Duel! It is a campy movie but still very fun to watch.
5,"Good, even if you don't understand the words","The first time that I saw this movie, I was resting in a Prague hotel room after a long day of sightseeing. Flipping through the TV channels, I stopped on a movie that was just starting. The titles were all in German (I think), as was the dubbing, so I had no idea what I was watching. But from the first scene where the demon car delibrately attacks the bicyclists, I was hooked.A few years later, I posted a description of the movie on a forum, and someone recognized it. I rented it, and, to my delight, it was indeed The Car. Yes, some of the acting is wooden, and the script a bit cliched. But the car itself, with its mystery and mocking horn, sticks in my memory."
5,Makes you want to RODEO,The Passenger has to be one of the most haunting country songs ever. If RE-RIDE doesn't get you adrenalin flowing you are probably dead.
4,Great bubble solution!,Really happy with this bubble solution and it comes with a long double wand inside the bottle! No problem getting a LOT of bubbles that are very light and floaty! Just what I wanted.
5,Uniquely helpful atlas.,"Size is right. Organization is right. Graphics, colors, and font sizes are right. Facts are right. Paper weight is right. Even price is right. There is no true replacement for this exceptional product."
3,Georgia Atlas & Gazetteer,"This State Map is the best I can find. I have several of these, and use them frequently to choose routes that I want to travel. The Best!"
3,Too large...,"Had I know the atlas was this large I would not have purchased it. Really, at this size I cannot use it at all."
1,The worst Documentry ever,"I was so disappointed. I own about 50ish documentaries on the law of attraction, positive self talk, making changes in ones life, etc. This movie gave so suggestions on what someone can do to make changes in their life, other than just quit your job and follow your dream which may work for some, but without the ""how to"" part, I found it quite useless. To date, I have loaned it to 4 people and they gave it back with basically the same report. This is the very first time I have bought a video and felt that I totally wasted my money. Usually, I get something out of everything I watch."
2,ok,to make a movie about making a movie ...well I didnt like it very much I liked the scenes from the school in africa though lots of talented kids there
2,Sorry,"Sorry,This video just didn't do it for me. Was really expecting something much more. You know you pack up and take off somewhere and let things happen for you. Not really a new idea."
1,annoying!,"Maybe I just never ""got it"" When this band was big, people loved them, I despised them. I think this guy cannot sing, and people say he was the best at it? I found death metal singers that didn't grate on my nerves as much as his voice does, and that fat bee girl pisses me off too. This is way to hippy dippy for anyone.....shame on all you!"
5,the most underated collection of recordings ever heard,"5 stars does not do this album justice. an unequivical masterpiece. if you don't appreciate this album,i'd hate to see what you do appreciate. i do think it is kind of special though that few can feel in their soul what shannon is expressing in his music. it is a gift to those that can hear and feel it. may he find the peace he never could here on earth. ""soup"" is also a wonderful album. if you are a fan you must also own ""nico"" though it does not enrapture as do its predecessors."
5,Don't let the legacy of blind melon die,"Without question, this is the single most unappreciated album of the nineties. When most attention was being thrown to bands such as pearl jam and alice in chains, blind melon had a spirituality that touched listeners unlike any previous records. It is obvious that a tremendous amount of heart and feeling went into this album, which makes me respect it even more. With the death of Shannon Hoon, the popularity of blind melon has dwindled, aside from hardcore fans. How sad is that? This album is pure heart and anybody that enjoys being moved by music should no doubt check out this album."
5,Green album turns gold,"This is the first album from Blind Melon and it shows how green they were at the time. With singing sometimes drawn out a little to long and jamming not far behind. These can be debated as imperfections or seen as an incredible first for a group so young to the industry at the time. Most of the songs are happy hemp friendly jingles like the hit single NO RAIN. Some are serious lyric driven songs with tones that will survive the test of time such as CHANGE. This album illustrates young musicians exploring the common world of first freedom from home and the questions that arise from it. Since I've so far told you how green and these guys were; let me move on. More songs worth noting SOAK THE SIN, TONES OF HOME , TIME, PAPER SCRATCHER, I WONDER. All great. The sonics are a 3 out of 5; being critical.If I had to describe there music it would be Groovy rock. It's groove makes you want to dance with your eyes closed and lay in the grass."
4,Easier to Play than the Video,"For me, this is the kind of album which makes the selection features of CD technology worth having. I only have two favorite songs on this album at this time. When I bought it, ""No Rain"" was the only one that I ever wanted to hear. Then someone who knew about my interest in the therapeutic use of music suggested that I listen to the song ""Change"" on this album, and I already owned it. I don't care about how much other people might dislike the other songs on this album. Any group that could get together to play the song ""Change"" is begging for forgiveness for all the songs that they have done that other people didn't like. No one has to listen to these songs to see how sorry they are, but there are times when I would recommend it."
3,It's alright,"Nothing special here aside from the song ""No Rain"", but it's still a pretty good album. Decent rock form a decent band."
2,A Hair Band Without The Hair,"Although they are frequently mistaken for an alternative band, Blind Melon are really a hard rock band in the tradition of The Black Crowes and Led Zeppelin. Fans of 80s metal will find much to admire, as will fans of hard rock of any time. I find them virtually unlistenable. D"
2,"Not My Thing, Really","Although they are frequently mistaken for an alternative band, Blind Melon are really a hard rock band in the tradition of The Black Crowes and Led Zeppelin. Fans of 80s metal will find much to admire, as will fans of hard rock of any time. I find them virtually unlistenable."
3,"Not bad, not that good","Sleepyhouse and No Rain are alright songs, but this isn't anything mind blowing. I guess they had potential..."
3,All I can say is that....,"Really, I don't know what to say.... While I think Blind Melon is a good band that was certainly overlooked, their music don't really work in the long run. Both here {and on their second album, ""Soup""} they have some good moments {see tracks such as: ""I wonder"", ""No Rain"", ""Sleepy House"", ""Change"", ""Seed to a tree"" and ""Drive""}, where their mixure of The Greatful Dead, 1960s hard rock and blues really works, but in the times it's not it can be really fairly not interesting."
5,this is the best album ever made.,"this is the best album ever made...and yes, i am serious. so just go buy it, it will change your life."
5,Incredible,"Shannon Hoon had one of the best voices in 90s rock, and it's quite a shame he died. Every song is a killer, espeically ""I Wonder"", track three. No Rain is great too, no matter how many times you hear it. Over all, great great stuff.-Dan"
5,"#1 blind melon fan! - Pompano Beach, FL (217)","Dearest new listeners, I first tuned in to blind melon in 1992. They were only playing in little bars and clubs. Although i never heard them play, at the time, i still read about them. i bought this album in 1993, i believe. i have to agree on bmelon2076@yahoo.com from cleveland-remarks. I have never been so lost and then listend to this album only to realize I'm not the only one. It made me as if I was touched by an angel. Blind Melon, as one, is full of soul and energy. I think that the rest of the band are not given enough credit, when they all produced the musice together. please email me if you'd like to chat more on Blind Melon. lizweaver@hotmail.com -thanks! And god bless!"
5,One of best albums of this decade...,"Like most people I purchased this CD for the single ""No Rain"". At first I was disappointed because the rest of the tracks didn't sound anything like ""No Rain"" so I buried at the bottom of my CD collection. However, when I dug it up a few months later it instantly became one of my favorites of all time. It has a unique sound that fuses hard rock, grunge, funk, folk, etc. underscored with really great guitar work and distinctive vocals. Buy this CD!"
2,Hard Read,I bought this for an International Business class I am taking and I my grade did not require me to read this book I wouldn't have. Instead of writing a book he should have written a 10-20 page article in the business journal. Most of each chapter is regurgitated a few times and he never really gets to a point. There is something to be said to teach and not write.
5,The Best Way To Start For The Beatle Beginner (Part 1),"For those just starting out as Beatles fans.....Welcome. Not sure how to start ? Look no further. Instead of buying different albums or discs trying to figure them out start here. This is the start and pretty much the best of their early work and hits. It will bring alive The Beatles and yea your going to get hooked. You'll play these songs over and over again. They say you can't ware out a CD. You can and you will with this. The only down fall is that you WILL DEMAND MORE. Dont let the heavy price get you. You will find that this is more then worth it's price and a better start then ""1"" or Past Masters. Without a doubt this is the best way for a new fan to start. I was very happy to open this disc and see it on Apple too. Enjoy and please also see my review on the 1967 - 1970 disc too./No Neck"
4,"YOU CAN'T GO WRONG WITH THIS BUT CONSIDER THE ""1"" ALBUM","A very good compilation, nothing to say about the songs included here. But I think that if you're looking something to start, you can buy this item and the blue album. Another good choice would be the CD called ""1"", but you wouldn't get some tunes included in this item and its companion (the blue album), but surely a far better sound since the ""1"" album was given a very good remastering that this compilations lacks, (that's the reason for which I rate this item ""only"" with four stars) and you will pay less for a single disc compilation. Both choices are here, and each one has its pros and cons, but anyway you can't go wrong with any choice you take."
3,The Capitol Records Getover.,"As far as the music contained on ""Red"",I give it 5 stars.But honestly,Capitol Records could have fit both albums on 1 CD.They did it with ""Endless Summer"" by The Beach Boys. I can see ""Blue"" being on 2 because it is too long to fit on 1 CD but ""Red""? You do the math.The Beatles put out some good music in their career but as usual,Capitol Records is finding a way to scam the record buying public.Wait!..they could have put some bonus tracks-oh,that's too much like straight."
3,"Good, But Obsolete","It's not that the songs aren't great on this 2 CD set. It's just that a poor value on CD has not aged well, and is approaching obsolescence with the advent of the Beatles 1 CD (release date set to 11/14/2000). If you look at the lineup of songs, you could buy the new Beatles 1 CD, and Rubber Soul, and have most of the major tracks on the red set, plus several from the blue set (1966-1970). In addition, songs like Girl and Nowhere Man are missing here, so the combination of 1 and Rubber Soul gives the avid Beatles listener more bang for the buck, at a much lower price....Otherwise, my recommendation is to buy the new CD and splurge on Rubber Soul for a much more complete sense of what the Beatles were about."
2,Shame on you Capitol Records...,"First off,as far as the music is concerned the album deserves a full 5.I don't care if certain songs are in mono or stereo as long as they sound good.Second off,for some reason unbeknownst to me,Capitol Records chose to put ""1962-1966"" out as two discs.It could have very easily fit on one disc,thereby slashing some of this re-issue's HUGE overprice.Capitol Records is why I'm only giving this album 2 stars.Third and finally,""Revolver"" was poorly represented.Capitol could have added a couple of tracks from that album as bonus selections."
3,3 stars only because of the price,"The only reason to get this collection instead of the individual albums is that this is the only place you'll find many of The Beatles' early hits remixed in stereo. All of the early albums were mostly in mono, so some remixing was done to get what is on the red album (the same was true of the LP). If you can live without the stereo remixes, the get the original albums."
3,Sixty-Five Minutes of Music on TWO CDs? Can You Say RIP-OFF?,"Most people have already heard most of the songs here, so I won't review them except to write that they are almost all of five-star quality.So why the lower rating? Well, this is a two-disc compilation, which means there's room here for two and half hours of music. But the combined length of the ""Red Album"" is 15 minutes less than the potential length of one compact disc. Consdering how much good early Beatles material was not included on this, the CD release should have added more songs. Or it simply could have put the original two LPs on ONE CD -- as apposed to wasting an extra disc and setting the list price of this collection at more than $30. What a disgrace!"
1,Beatles 1962-1966 (the red album),I was not very happy with this purchase or the last purchase of the pianist.The pianist was defective and i had to return and pay shipping charges then reorder and pay charges again.I could have bought a copy at best buy for less money and trouble.Then i ordered the beatles red album and it was defective.The 2 cd set is labeled right but all the songs off of cd 2 is on cd 1 & 2.I sent a complaint and find out the cd was sent from England now i am concerned about sending it back and paying shipping charges to England.So for now i still have the beatles cd that is defective and i dont know what to do. Charles Lund
1,non-existent,"There is ""the White Album"", the real title of which is ""The Beatles"", but the Beatles never recorded an album entitled or called ""The Red Album"". I love and very much recommend all Beatles albums, but this isn't one."
1,overrated treacle merchants,Music that's as heartfelt and resonant as a chewing gum commercial jingle
1,Not enough tracks,"All reasonable songs, but there's about 95 minutes worth of disc place where they could put the whole of Revolver (quite a good album IMHO) and a good deal more of Rubber Soul and Help (not bad albums) on it to make it a much better value package. A bit like they did with the Rolling Stones Rolled Gold when they re-released it recently."
1,overrated rock band,"Oooopssss....The Beatles are one of the most overrated rock bands of all time. Their music is just OLD! Whoever said this album was great must been SMOKIN' because this stuff is BORING.I'm sick of people calling the Beatles the greatest rock band of all time. There are several other rock bands better than the Beatles. Listen to my 3 favorite bands of all time. They are Green Day, Dire Straits, & Guns N' Roses, & they are the BEST.Buy any album from them and stop wasting time with the BEATLES!HAHA."
1,It actually deserves less than that,The Beatles are one of the worst bands around. I and many others believe that they should die like John Lennon. That is all I have to say
2,"CHILDISH, POP MUSIC","The opitomy (spelling??) of how stupid this album is as a whole is the one song ""Paperback Writer"". The rest of the songs make even less sense, except for maybe a few, or they sound like rehashings of songs already on this Cd; ""Hard Day's Night"", ""Eight Days a Week"" and ""Can't Buy me Love"" are the kinds of songs even a kareoke singer could have made a living off of if they knew how to write a basic song AND they all sound the same. The rest of the songs are just plain too darn easy to overlook 'cause they're STUPID!!!If I were to give The Beatles credit for being good songwriters I would use most of the songs from the companion to this CD - 1967-1970 - as examples."
1,never again with Amazone,"I did not hear it yet I ordered it only a few minutes ago. I am trying to change this order but for some reason I cann't, I keep getting a run around. I wanted o get a better grade of the album I ordered and also tried to combine the two orders. This is my first try at ordering onthe internet and this was a bad expierence...never again good bye MrOrsino"
1,MOST OVERRATED BANDS IN HISTORY,"MY GOD!! THIS IS EVEN WORSE THAN THE FORTY LICKS OR ZOSO OF THE ROLLING STONES, AND LED ZEPPELIN. THE BEATLES ARE ONE OF THE MOST OVERRATED, STUPID, LAME, AND LOUSIEST BANDS OF ALL TIME.LOVE ME DO HAS TO BE ONE OF THE LOUSIEST SONGS I HAVE EVER HEARD.ANYONE WHO LISTENS TO THE BEATLES MAY HAVE NO TASTE IN MUSIC. EVEN METALLICA IS BETTER THAN THESE LOOSERS. GET THEM, AND AVOID ALL ALBUMS FROM THE BEATLES. THEY ARE JUST AS BAD AS OTHER LOUSY BANDS LIKE LED ZEPPELIN, ROLLING STONES, WHO, BOSTON, LYNYRD SKYNYRD, BLACK SABBATH, PINK FLOYD, QUEEN, STEVE MILLER, AND AC/DC. GET ANY ALBUM FROM GREAT BANDS LIKE DIRE STRAITS, METALLICA, NIRVANA, GUNS N' ROSES, GREEN DAY, AND FOREIGNER INSTED."
5,Could you ask for a better CD????,"The Beatles are the best there is, was, and ever will be. This has to be the best CD ever. Who could ask for more, She Loves You, Please Please Me, Help, Ticket to Ride, Yesterday, and more. If you are thincking of getting this CD, DDDDOOO IIITTT. There might be only one flaw and that is that they don't have I Sould Have Known Better. but not everyone is perfect. BBBBBBBUUUUUUUYYYYYY TTTHHHHHHIIIISSS CCCCCCCDDDDD"
2,BUU THE REAL ALBUMS,"For not that much more, you can buy all the albums that this album contains, and it is WELL worth it's weight in gold. This album is a decent grouping of trendy songs done buy the beatles, but if you want the REAL beatles, get the albums. It is well worth it."
3,Shame on them for not remixing this,If you have the box set make your own set and reward yourself with a few bonus tracks. If you don't have the box set then you will be pleased with this because every song is a masterpiece.These songs were lifted from the 2009 remasters. If they remixed them I would have given it five stars. It is a five star collection for the casual fan or the die hard fan who doesn't have the box set.
4,It could have been better,"The remaster was good. One thing that I had not notice since I first got the album back in the 70s is that there's no George Harrison tracks. I don't know if it was done on purpose or what. I think that if your ending in the year 1966 with songs from ""Revolver"" you could have added ""Taxman"" to the mix instead of having ""Yellow Submarine"" to end the album. So let me get this straight Ringo gets to sing but George is left out. They could have a least included on George Harrison song. Then again is they just wanted to stick to Lennon-McCartney tunes I'm pretty sure they could have included one that George sang. I think that this was a great injustice that was corrected in the Blue album. I think it could have been better if they would have included a song from George Harrison he deserved that much."
1,RUINING PRODUCT SALES AND HORRIBLE COMPILATION,"Why not buy the Red Album? Becuase it contains the ""early"" beatles which is much like bubble gum music, becuase it has bad compilations of songs, becuase it is just plain bad! They forgot a lot of classics including ""Till There Was You"", ""I've Just Seen a Face"" ,""If I Fell"", ""Think for Yourself"", ""Good day Sunshine"", ""Tomorrow Never Knows"". And no biography or discography! buy the albums and live the beatles."
1,Unforgivable,"This and the ""blue"" album are responsible for my introduction to the Beatles when I was in the 3rd grade. This was probably more appealing to me at the time, and for that I am grateful, but I still petulantly grant this one star.First, it perpetuates the idea that there was a clear break between the early and late Beatles in 1966. Second, it gets the songs so wrong, e.g., omitting Tomorrow Never Knows and Taxman, let alone No Reply, while including Yellow Submarine, the comic relief from the lads' best album.When I tell people that We Can Work it Out is my favorite favorite of Beatles song, they often look at me like I'm a child. Why, isn't that pretty much like Love Me Do? I blame this album for the fact that the peak Beatles (65-66) are often dismissed as simplistic and inferior to their later work. Nonsense."
3,just a singles and b-sides collection,"fair enough most on here are class and should be on but most are singles and there b-sides showing how good they were. but there are only a few albumn tracks on here and drive my car should be off with im only sleeping, she said she said, taxman and here there and everywhere on it it would be 5 star nevermind the other tracks that should be on here but good all the same classic rockn roll mostly from me to you is fantastic so is all my loving on 2nd cd girl, paperback writer, norweigan wood and youve got to hide your love away standout.good but should be better."
4,Good Compliation of Classic Beatle Favorites,"I bought this double album CD set because I wanted a good collection of earlier Beatle hits to put on my iPod. While the first four songs are in mono, the rest are in stereo and sound great. It was announced a few days ago that the entire Beatles catalog will be reissued in remastered stereo in original UK editions. I have held off purchasing the Beatles hits on CD because they have not been remastered. I still have a large selection of records of their music and will be looking forward to the remastered CDs coming later this year. It is great to hear these songs on my iPod since Beatle music is not available in digital form yet. The Beatles still rock!"
3,Why 2 cds .... when it can be fitted on one .,"Yes an amazing collection of early beatles classis .... but still why the two cds when it can be fit on only one .... The WHO's Tommy is now on one cd , even though it is 74 mins long ...This is an unfair policy of the record company to sell it on two cds when it can all be fit on one .. Well what to say being a great bealtes i had to purchase it and fill the gaps in my cd collestion ... :)5 Stars for the music .... But 2 stars for putting it on two cds..."
4,My intro rock's best band!!!,"Like so many other Beatles fans born after their breakup (multiple decades, in my case), this is where I was first exposed to the Beatles. My parents owned (and still own) a vynil copy of this, and I remember listening to it obsessively, constantly replaying tracks such as Please Please Me, Can't Buy Me Love (that particular band of the vynil is probably worn out by now!) and Drive My Car. And then I used to sing Beatles songs at school, which would often earn me stares from several fans of MTV. Shortly after, I blew most of my hard-earned money on Beatles CD's. Sorry...Anyway, the music...OF COURSE IT'S GOOD! OK, maybe All My Loving is very skippable...and Revolver was DEFINITELY under-represented. (TWO cuts? Gimme a break!!!) However there are so many GREAT songs on this collection, it should be bought by any music fan!!!!"
4,The Red album,"Assembling a compilation of the Beatles is a difficult task, not only because they had an enormous number of hits, but also because singles didn't tell the full story; many of their album tracks were as important as the singles, if not more so. The double-album 1962-1966, commonly called The Red Album, does the job surprisingly well, hitting most of the group's major early hits and adding important album tracks like ""You've Got to Hide Your Love Away,"" ""Drive My Car,"" ""Norwegian Wood,"" and ""In My Life."" Naturally, there are many great songs missing from the 26-track 1962-1966, and perhaps it would have made more sense to include the Revolver cuts on its companion volume, 1967-1970, yet The Red Album captures the essence of the Beatles' pre-Sgt. Pepper records."
5,The best from the best.....,"Back in 1973,the four ex-beatles were asked to pick the songs that best represented their early career... here it is,I think they did a great job!"
2,Pointless,"Nearly every song The Beatles recorded is great, so why waste your time trying to pick out a few as the greatest hits? This (and the accompanying Blue album) are the only Beatles ""greatest hits"" albums, besides THE BEATLES 1, which is strictly No. 1 singles, rather than the debatable ""best of..."" While it is a good compilation, it still seems pointless to try to pick out the best of the Beatles."
5,Get Backstreet Boys instead????,"This is one of the biggest albums ever made. I am not a huge Beatles fan, I prefer Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Alan Parsons. But I must admit these guys were geniuses and their music put the base of what most people listen to nowadays. Simple and plain. That kid who recommended getting the Backstreet Boys instead, oh my God!!! I'll give him/her a recommendation back, go get Barney's music and videos instead of Backstreet Boys stuff. At least Barney looks less gay."
3,Hoodwinked.,"This is a ripoff. I've copied both my CD and LP versions onto one CD. There is no reason this should cost 30 some bucks.The remastering of ""I Feel Fine"" is cleaned up and, sadly, has lost its original character. If you have the original LP, keep it."
4,62-66,"The first disc is simply great. The second disc starts off strong, but ends with a mere shadow of the greatness of disc one, because the final tracks (with the exception of the wonderful Paperback Writer) are weak songs from Rubber Soul and Revolver. Overall, a good sampler of the early years."
1,Smells like cashing in,not many tracks considering the price. people need to get into perspective that this is just an over rated band. the most over rated in history i would argue! Certainly some amazing songs especially the ballads but no where near worthy of the best band ever title. All these songs have been flogged and there is a smell of cashing in about these remastered albums.
5,Good Selection Of Early Hits,"The ""1"" collection simply does not cover this period well. If you need a collection for the car, this will work fine and price is now right. Never mind that it all fits on one 80 minute CD. I changed my mind in favor of it once I had it.NOTE: The first four tracks are in Mono. The Please Please Me is off the mono 2009 remastered set."
3,"Similar to, but better than ""The Beatles 1""","PLEASE PLEASE ME 1963""Love Me Do""""Please Please Me""WITH THE BEATLES 1963""All My Loving""A HARD DAY'S NIGHT 1964""A Hard Day's Night""""Can't Buy Me Love""""And I Love Her""BEATLES FOR SALE 1964""Eight Days a Week""HELP! 1965""Help!""""You've Got to Hide Your Love Away""""Ticket to Ride""""Yesterday""RUBBER SOUL 1965""Drive My Car""""Norwegian Wood""""Nowhere Man""""Michelle""""In My Life""""Girl""REVOLVER 1966""Eleanor Rigby""""Yellow Submarine""Singles""From Me to You"" ""She Loves You"" ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" ""I Feel Fine"" ""We Can Work It Out"" ""Day Tripper"" ""Paperback Writer""____________________________________RUBBER SOUL was way too over-represented and REVOLVER way too under-represented. ""Girl"" and ""Drive My Car"" are not quite worthy of ""best of"" status, while ""Taxman"" from REVOLVER is. But for the casual fan who is just getting to know the Beatles, I highly recommend this set. It is more comprehensive than ""The Beatles 1."""
4,IMPRESSIVE BEATLES PACKAGE#1,This is a great compilation of Beatles tracks from 1962-1966. It mainly concentrates on the 1964 Beatlemania era but also has a wide collection of songs from Rubber Soul however it lacks enough tracks from 1966 (which had some great Beatles songs recorded at the time!)I would reccommend this album to a fan who wants to get into the Beatles. It covers quite a bit but lacks any 1966 tracks. Still definetly worth it! Remains one of my favourites!
5,the best!,"this is the greatest beatles collection u can have! it brings back all of the oldest memories of my child hood in albama... if you like the beatles, you have to have this one!"
3,The album is okay,It's not my favorite Beatles album but it does have some good songs. I'll have to say that the 1967-1970 album is a lot better.
5,The best CD to cheer you up!!,This cd is great just to listen to on the road. It has some of the beatles greatest songs ever. If your really board just listen to this it will cheer you right up!!By this CD today!
4,top notch but not the best,"if you're just getting interested in the beatles and have a preferance in music too diverse to get all the albums of any particular band you like (as plenty of reviewers seem to recommend when reviewing any greatest hits compilation) then you're in the same possition I was a month ago. The solution? well, seeing as how they're the biggest band EVER I decided I'd make an exception to my ""1 CD per artist"" rule and bought both this and 67-70. If you can afford to do this go for it! but if you really only want 1 beatles CD, get 67-70. It's pure genius"
1,"Great music, but Apple/Capitol is ripping us off!","In 1973 Apple/Capitol released the RED and the Blue albums,to chronicle the Beatles career. When released on vinyl the Red album was a two record set. However in the age of the compact disc,Apple/Capitol decided that they should release a 60 minute album(80 minutes of music can fit on a single CD)in a two CD set and sale it for about $32.00, when in all reality it should sale for $10-$14. All the hits you would expect are present, but the price of the CD is poor, and the sound quality could be better. I recommend purchasing The Beatles 1 instead."
3,Where's the rest...,"This is a GREAT Cd! I absolutely love the music! However, I think they should have included other songs like George Harrison's ""Do You Want To Know A Secret?"" Or The first song Paul ever wrote ""I'll Follow The Sun."" And where is that Kite song? Where is ""When I'm 64?"" Forget that gawd aweful Drive My Car song. None of these songs are on the Red, White, or Blue albums.Maybe the Beatles were too good for their own good and not everything could be included. Blah! But I like to compare the cover photos of the old Beatles and the older Beatles."
2,Beatles,Disk One - outstanding. Every song a classic.Disk two - mediocre. Too dominated by awful music from Rubber Soul and Revolver.Overall rating - 2 stars. Better to buy Beatles 1.
1,"The ""red"" and ""blue"" of it all?","Being a big time Beatles fan since 1964. There is still no other band that gets as much play around my house. Great choice of songs here that any one would love to hear over and over again.The ""RED & ""BLUE"" albums are examples of stuff the record label was putting out. With no other reason except to offset the sales of Paul McCartney & John Lennon solo lp's. In their pitiful effort to force The Beatles back into reforming. (Along with lp's called, Rock and Roll Music & Love Songs) Notice they would always release them at the same time John or Paul had a new solo lp coming out.? Just buy the official Beatles cd's and all your dreams will come true, lol."
5,Great,"Only 3 songs - Eleanor Rigby, Yellow Submarine, and Michelle - make this less than a perfect offering. This is a great sampler of Beatlemania before they moved into the Magical Mystery Tour and Sgt. Pepper era."
3,finger picken,This is well written book with some good arrangments of songs. However I only gave it 3 stars because the tab is so small it is hard to read. I do not think you could take this book to a gig and read it. They mixed it up so much some of the tab is big and some is so small. the writers of these books should realize that if someone is going to the trouble to transfer a song to tab to make it big enough to see.
5,Bernie and Sam are a HOOT!!,I so miss Bernie Mac. This was one of his funniest movies. I so enjoyed it. Samuel had me in tears.
3,"Not bad, if you can get through the first half hour","I almost turned it off, but my husband asked to stick with it for a few more minutes to see if it got better.It does. The first half hour is continual cursing. I understand that, but didn't care to go through another hour of it. The next hour was completely different.Yes, there was cursing, and there was contention, but the musical episodes were great fun, as was the rebuilding of relationships, and living dreams. Seems they wanted to cram most of the cursing into the first part of the movie.I wouldn't recommend it as a movie to watch with chidren, but it's worthwhile if you like a movie that is both comedy and soul-searching. Samuel L. Jackson is, as always, one of our best living actors."
2,soul men,I thought this movie was going to be so funny but nope it's just stupid if you ask me. It's a shame too cuz usually Bernie Mack is pretty funny.
2,no soul in soul men,"Proves the point that you cant out-act the director. Nothing wrong with the script or actors, the director must be the one to blame. Not a total waste of time, but pretty close."
3,Soul Men Review,the blu-ray picture is clear. the sound is good. the movie not the best i seen. i heard it was super funny or decently funny i thought it was just alright nothing super. still got it at a good price here at amazon so will keep buying.
3,Not very funny,I expected more from this movie. There were very few truly funny moments although I am fans for both actors.
2,It is funny only for ADULTS,"Some may find it funny not all, it is because it too offensive with too much of bad words and too much of naked intercourse going on, my christian mom turned her mom wouldn't watch it. I already knew from a sec. when I saw first part that she would not watch it because when he was in bed with a woman that made him speaking gibberlish ...I was like oh man! Mom ain't gotta like it. anyway I kept it to watch it for myself, my bro, or dad also family/friends. I also don't blame ppl who don't want to. But at the end, it is like too nice with his friend and him making a bonding with daughter."
1,"the ""F"" word is used through out this picture","i don't think the ""F"" word is necessary to make this picture. i would never let my wife or daughters watch any kind of picture where the only word used is the ""F"" word. this is an example of poor judgement on the part of the producers and director. i do not recommend this movie, another piece of garbage."
1,Soul Men,This movie was awful. I like it for reasons being that this was Bernie and Issaic last movie before thet died.
5,worth it,"I turned 16 during the summer of love ('67). Played my first gig when I was 14. If music is in your blood and the Buffalo Springfield, Hollies, Byrds, or a multitude of other groups was any part of your growing up in the 60's, this book is worth the time. It is extremely detailed and at times may seem boring or redundant-- but gives a behind-the-scenes, inside view of the personal relationships and problems/benefits that go along with the territory and is actually a smooth read. I've read all the books that everyone has written on this stuff---but still came away with some new insight on CSNY---- and especially the individual players that made the group. Definitely worth it and I'll read it again."
4,A good biography...,"I really enjoyed this bio; well-written, well-researched, cooperation from the subjects yet not fawning as many are when the subjects are still alive. The author brings all of the band members to life and their lives are very interesting in the way he tells about them.It was impossible not to feel for David Crosby during the time while awaiting sentencing and then being released from prison, as he was honest about his fears, his emotions, his feelings, etc...also during the period of his liver transplant.This was the first book I have read that made Joni Mitchell seem likable, I have to say. Perhaps because the band members all liked her so much, but other books I have read concerning this musical era make her out to be much more of a prima donna. She is not profiled here, but appears often.Worthwhile, enjoyable book."
4,"Crosby, Stills & Nash: The Biography",This book is easy reading. I'm a CSN & Y fan and I'm finding their individual and group stories very interesting. I would recommend this to anyone who followed the band in the 70's.
4,SLANTED,"NOT TO BAD BUT A BIT SLANTED TOWARD PLUS SIDE OF GROUP..LOTS OF SONG ADVERTISEMENTS AND ""ATTA BOYS"" IF YOU ARE A CSNY FAN YOU WON'T BE OFFENDED ON ANY NEGATIVE CRITICISMS OF THE GROUP AS THERE ARE FEW"
3,Glossed over some details,"I love CSN. I still listen to them with as much love as ever. While this book gave lots of detail, some details were glaringly absent, like David's long descent into a very serious drug addiction. When he was unable to record or do shows, the book glosses over this by saying, ""he was sick"" or some such nonsense. All of the information is out there, we the fans know the story, so it would have served us all better to just be honest about it. It could have been a story of redemption; a cautionary tale, a life lesson; the story of enduring friendship with all of the ups, downs, and pains. But it was all but left out. It loses stars for that."
1,Price Gauging on small piece of German chocolate,"While German chocolate tastes very good, I grew up with it, charging $4.99 for this is pretty lame, yes I did read the description and bought it, however this store or seller is taking it from the living, in other words, I don't think I come back to buy, to expensive!"
2,Shame on Skylink,Skylink knows there is a problem with the auto dialer. From reading most of the reviews I can back them up. I can't stop the false calls to my emergency number. I un plugged the unit and took out the telephone cord. The darn thing will not stop calling. The instructions just aren't good enough for this problem. I will spend my day off next Saturday trying to fix the problem myself because Skylink is no help. I want to return the dialer but keep the other half of the system. I will fix the problem one way or the other.
1,Bad Quality! Broken in less than a year!,I bought the complete 1000 system. Everything still works EXCEPT the dialer. The temp sensor needed relocating a curcuit to stop it calling every day (customer service did help with that) but now the dialer is totally dead! i bought a different brand motion detector and temp detector and still use the other parts of the 1000 system for its alarm function only.
1,Leaves a lot to be desired,"The Skylink AD-433S dialer came with conflicting instructions, and despite three phone conversations with their tech department, we could not get this to dialer to work properly. I finally sent it back to their ""repair"" office, and it cost me an additinal $19.00 in postage. I still waiting for some response from the company."
3,pilot,"The first time I was testing, it quit and the screen went blank. I had to take the battery out and start again. Skylink should not include batteries because half of them arrived DOA. The casing is cheap"
1,This dialer is a piece of junk,"The construction is shoddy, the controls are non-intuitive and the unit I received did not function. The support from the manufacturer is by email only and not very helpful."
1,Skylink AD-433S Emergency Dialer,Instructions are marginal; fortunately I am technical enough to read. Big problem for me is that it will not dial over my VOIP line but that was never stated in product specs (that I could find). I don't know whether it is design relatd or defective dialer. I use Vonage system. Do not recommend purchase.
4,"Good video, just wish it were available as a DVD","My 15 month old son likes this video, but I would really prefer a DVD format. In general, his favorites are ""A CELEBRATION OF ME - GROVER"" & ""ELMO'S SING-ALONG GUESSING GAME""."
3,Too short and lacking to hold my toddler or family.,"This collection was really too short to be a collection and was missing the two skits that we were out to collect; ""But I like you"" and ""Dance myself to sleep"". It did have a cute song about friends, the moon song and the association of ""W Lovers"". Other skits were songless and entertaining for older viewers, all three of them: Egypt, movie,and camping. A portion of the twenty-five minutes or so were filled with joining but not particularily interesting discussions of baby sitting and photo albums. Our parting words were ""What! That's it?!?"""
2,A little slow,"This video was a little slow moving for my 10 month old daughter. There isn't a lot in it to hold her attention. There weren't as many songs in it as there are in the other Sesame Street videos, and some of the skits were obviously VERY old (70's)."
3,Needs more Ernie and Bert,"What if Sesame Street made a 'best of' video and didn't invite the stars to the party?Poor Ernie and Bert don't even get the chance to introduce their favourite bits in this too short, half-hour video. Instead, the viewer gets stuck with Big Bird and Gina. Whatever goodwill is generated during Ernie and Bert is swept away with the useless banter between our hosts.While we get to see Bert playing checkers with a pigeon, where's Ernie singing Rubber Ducky? That classic bit should have been a no-brainer for this compilation.Two great talents get the short-thrift from their superiors on this one. That's too bad."
4,"Entertaining for kids, nostalgic for adults","I have to agree that there's no way to get all the great Ernie and Bert skits and songs into one movie, even if they made it longer than 30 minutes. This is a nice start. Maybe we'll see more collections later. Anyhow, my toddler loves this (though the talking statue in Egypt scared him a little at first, now he laughs)and we find it brings back memories of our own childhoods."
2,Maine Mama,"My 17 month old has been real hot on these characters... so I ordered this video. It simply did not measure up to other Sesame Street videos we have bought. There are many others that are far more engaging. As likeable as Bert and Ernie are, I think this one is kind of a snoozer"
2,Too short and lacking to hold my toddler or family.,"This collection is really too short to be a collection and was missing the two skits that we were out to collect; ""But I like you"" and ""Dance myself to sleep"". Not even ""Rubber Duckie"", which is an Ernie classic, is included. It did have a cute song about friends, the moon song and the association of ""W Lovers"". Other skits were songless and entertaining for older viewers, all three of them: Egypt, movie,and camping. A portion of the twenty-five minutes or so were filled with joining but not particularily interesting discussions of baby sitting and photo albums. Our parting words were ""What! That's it?!?"""
4,Wish it was longer!,"My son loves Bert and Ernie so I had to buy this video. It's not his favorite, Kids Favorite Songs 2 is, but he does sit down for this one. I can tell he's anticipating the rubber ducky song! A little disappointed it's conducted with Gina and Big Bird looking through a book to show you little clips on Bert and Ernie but it's a good video overall. Just wish it was a bit longer like the one hour Elmo tapes! By the time the half hour video is over and I can get another one in the vcr, my son is gone."
5,"Clymer, Haynes, Chilton....","A manual from any one of these three will suffice but I do like Clymers. Also, I'm not even sure the other two publish bike manuals. Seems to me like Clymers has less tech talk and more real instruction from my experience with the other two, not to mention more pictures. A manual is the first thing I buy for all my vehicles as they are truly worth their weight in gold if you are willing to get your hands dirty. I've picked up a CR125 since I bought this and went ahead and got the Clymer manual for it too. I guees I'll be buying Clymer manuals for my bikes from now on... Haynes or Chiltons for the truck... Even if it isn't this one, buy a manual. It will pay for itself the first time you use it and the next owner of your vehicle will really appreciate it."
5,Very appealing scent,I loved this scent when I first smelled it on someone back in the 80's. Yes that long ago. So I bought it for my son in high school. He gets compliments left and right on it. They absolutely love it. Even the guys are asking what it is so they can get it. It is a shame that you cannot find it in the department stores anymore. But you can get some good deals on line. Just remember one scent does not always smell the same on everyone. Your body chemistry plays a huge factor in how a scent will smell on you.
4,Kouros ....not the old,Kouros of the 1977 are much better than the one of 2012. Please keep the old standard. Thanks. smell fades away fast.
4,ALWAYS A CLASSIC FRAGRANCE FOR MEN,"For me, a classic is something of which I never tire. That's surely the case with this men's cologne.Kouros, the classic figure of a Greek youth, in all probability an athlete, is an apt name for this scent from Saint Laurent. It's vigorous, dynamic and free-spirited.A combination of a woodsy fragrance and spicy notes make it popular - a man's cologne with scent-appeal.The container is trim, rather stately, reminiscent of a Greek column"
1,Not recommended,"Some people really love this fragrance, however, this is a very controversial cologne that many people will not like. This takes a lot of patience to learn to enjoy, so this is difficult to wear in public.The smell is not clean, it is ashy and floral. The scent is strongly similar to a urinal cake and sweat(and I am not joking). You can see the hundreds of reviews on Basenotes.com for Kouros, and at least 1/3 of the reviewers acknowledge that this smells like a public restroom. Not everyone will make this association, but many people will.This is not safe to wear in public and I wouldn't recommend wearing this at least until you try a sample first.I don't want to be dogmatic and say that nobody will enjoy this. Some people really love this. But personally, I would never wear this."
4,Kouros US,"I have been using this French product for many years. Its smell seems to arouse sympathy at any place I traveled to in the Americas, Africa, Asia and Europe. This time I was able to buy some containers at the lowest price met anywhere during the past 15 years, probably due to the economic slowdown. Many thanks to the Amazon purchasing department, which obviously obtained surplus stock at a deep discount from a respected manufacturer."
5,This Book Teaches an Invaluable Life Lesson,"Hi. I am eighteen, and this book is totally and without exaggeration invaluable to me. The main purpose of this book is to instill a passion and a sort of optimism into young teenagers for investing. It succeeds in this area without a doubt. Because of this book, I am opening a brokerage account and mutual fund even though I have but an incremental amount of money to invest. This book does not simply start talking about investing in the foremost chapters. Instead, it gently warms the reader up to that point, talking of saving, making smart decisions, and the introduction of novel ways for a teenager to make money, like working in a bank! In short, I absolutely loved this book and will cherish it throughout my life!"
2,Too detailed for teens,Good concept but few teens I know would have the interest to read this very detailed book. It needs I suspect that the teen I bought it for may benefit from it when she reaches 30 years of age.
3,Outdated information,"The overall concepts in the book are presented well, but the details are out of date, especially telling kids they can expect an average of 11% annual return each year from the stock market. Wish that were true today but, sadly, it takes a lot more work to get that kind of return. If teenagers read this and believe it, they will be sadly disappointed at reality. Still, much of the book - saving money, defining compound interest, explaining owning stocks vs. mutual funds, etc. - is still relevant and well presented."
5,Good book for teens,I purchased this book for my kids last year. I am ordering more copies for my mother-in-law to give away to her other grandkids.
5,Canadian Ecstasy,"The Canadian Tenors DVD is two hours of pure bliss. We were mesmerized. Thank you for getting it to me so quickly, as usual."
2,Sad quality,"The sound quality was poor. It doesn't do justice to the incredible talent of the Tenors. I had just seen the tenors ""Lead with Your Heart"" special on Public Television, which puts this DVD to shame!"
5,Great gift,"A relative requested this as a gift and was very happy with the fact that she received the DVD instead of just the CD - these singers are incredibly talented and the repertoire varied enough to please everyone, from opera buffs to musical theater and pop music fans."
5,Canadian Tenors Fan!,"If you want an enjoyable concert to view, this one is tops! It was so good, I had to purchase more for gifts!"
5,Awesome!,"I recently discovered the Canadian Tenors and absolutely love them. I purchased this DVD for my Dad for Christmas and now he loves them too. I'm very pleased with this purchase, and Amazon is my new best friend!"
5,The Canadian Tenors: Live At The Royal Conservatory of Music Toronot,"This is absolutely fabulous. These fellows are so very talented, each with a different type of voice. Thus far, in my opinion, Celine Dion, Josh Groban, and now the Canadian Tenors have the voices of angels!"
3,"Great concert, but the audio mix is disappointing","I love this group and purchased this DVD with great anticipation. Sadly, the recording is (almost) ruined by the poor quality of the audio mixing. Some songs are mixed correctly, but on too many the instruments significantly overpower their voices. I keep wanting to reach forward to a mixing board and turn up the sliders for the voice channels. There also could be more surround sound content.The concert itself is well-done and features many of their signature songs. It may have sounded much better in person. I am still glad I bought this disc and listen to it with some regularity, but I would never use it to demo my music system due to the poorly done music/instrument mixing/recording on several of the songs. I hope they record another concert and hire a different sound technician next time."
5,Can't get enough of these guys,Spellbinding music - and with the DVD you can watch as well as listen. I just love these guys and their song choices.
5,I love this DVD,"I'm very happy with this product. It ws the first time i bought on amazon and it's fantastic, i like it so if you're not sure yet to buy with amazon... just do it now!! it's easy, fast and great."
3,"Pretty good, especially for free","Ella Fitzgerald is always enjoyable. I don't know when this was recorded, but it is good middle-of-the-road ballads and swing. I'm surprised that it's free. Like, how does Amazon make any money doing that? But for the price it can't be beat."
3,I ordered it but never received it.,"I don't know why Amazon prompted me to write this review. I ordered this book through Amazon, but never received it."
3,A Cold War Story,End of the cold war was an end of an era for great espionage books. This book is a nice addition to a collection of espionage stories of the era. The story is moulded around the debriefing of a defector. There are not a lot of thrills. But it'll hold your attention throughout.
4,Sitting Bull - 'Trip Away' (Long Hair),"Originally released in 1971, this was the obscure Bremen, Germany band's sole effort. This short-lived ensemble has sometimes been 'tagged' as krautrock - but 'Trip Away' is more in the bluesy psychedelic direction. Tunes that lured me in were the ten-minute title cut ""Trip Away"", the somewhat spine-tingling ""Everytime"", ""Hopeless Love"" (reminds me of Jefferson Airplane), ""Lonely Love"", ""Clean Survival"" and the rocking ""Your Lovin' Man"". Personnel: Piet Schimkat - vocals, Rolf Brockhorst - guitar, Benrd Zamulo - bass, piano & vocals and Achim Brierley - drums. Should definitely draw in serious fans of Quicksilver Messenger Service, the previously mentioned Jefferson Airplane, West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band and possibly Moby Grape."
5,King Crimson's Great!,This tape is a must for any King Crimson Fan. They are so great Live. They are just so in sync with each other. What a great performance.
4,"Best cases out there, somewhat",I bought this case because it was the only one I could find out of thousands that had a screen protector and a wheel protector. It is so cute and colorful. Not just a solid color. It has a clear back so you can see the engraving I have on the back of my Ipod which is cool. It has wholes in the bottom for the headphones and to charge it and one at the top for the hold switch. Very easy to get on and off. Very derable plastic. The only thing I'm not thrilled with is the thing is thicker then some of the other cases I've seen and it is sometimes hard to use the wheel. You really have to push hard on the plastic to get the wheel to work sometimes.
4,excellent,"This is another album proving Impulse was so much more than a free jazz label.This early issue, A-13, is exquisite hard bop features great Fuller compositions, ""Ladies Night,"" with masters like Jimmy Cobb and Freddy Hubbard backing the valve man. The prize has to be their take on Sinatra's ""Wee Small Hours."" The impossible is done: one of the most potently depressing songs is turned into a whirling jam.Why my fuss about the catalog number? This was one of the first released on the amazing black and orange, probably 1961, as this numbering system was only used the first few years of the label. I found it on wax yesterday and it sits on my shelf, spine strong as iron and gloss in tact. Hats off to the golden age of vinyl."
3,Grat smell!!,"Because this was to little, I can tell you how this worked for me, but I love the smell. I'll buy the big one next time!!"
5,Like a souped-up time machine delivered a house party!,"This is a slab of vinyl that I am DAMN glad to see dressed up for digital! Peter Zaremba enlisted delegates Wendy Wild, Barrence Whitfield and others to throw everything they had into this collection of 60's garage faves and note-perfect originals. I defy you not to be drenched in sweat after a single listen -- the horns, guitars, and sing along vocals have an infectious energy that is IMPOSSIBLE to fight.If you're heart's in consternation, don't waste time -- Send in the LOVE DELEGATION!"
5,"By far, my favorite",I am a portrait photographer and I pull this book out all the time to review lighting set ups and get inspiration. A definate must have for any photographer. I especially love that the book extensively covers one and two light set up and using foamcore bookends. You don't need a bazillion lights to create amazing images.
3,Great if you want Art photography,"This book is the one for you if you are interested in learning to light for art photography. In the second paragraph of the introduction, the author says ""if you are intersted in social photography this book is not for you."" In other words, if you are interested in taking flattering portraits of family and friends or typical clients, it is not for you. The photographs in the book are very artistic -- one is of a woman with an egg cracked on her face?"
4,very heavy,Bought it for my daughter for her first Mothers Day. She loved it but said it was a litttle heavy around her neck all day
3,Do not fit,"I bouhgt this for my Nissan Sentra SE-R20 like the trim idicated it has a 2000cc engine everything bigger in this model, starting with the engine, the body, the bars off course so the bushing did not fit and I had to adapt them by wearing the inside of them. They work fine but I'm not that happy with the part finder, I feel like it is not that dependable."
3,I recommend it to aviation lovers .,"This biography is , in my humble opinion , not perfect but you'll know more about this fantastic pioneer : Amelia ."
4,Convincing investigative work,"I always thought that the B20 story was a little bit fictitious and Michael Asher puts forward a convincing logic to his story. If you read his findings you'll start to see holes appear in McNab's and Ryan's versions. By Asher's accounts, these men have already disgraced the regiment by bad-mouthing a fallen comrade and lied about/embellished the rest.Asher goes back to the LUP, where the whole cock-up begins, and then traces the supposed journey all the way through to its conclusion by talking to local people who were present at the time. Unless the whole of the Iraqi people were there to spin a yarn, it's hard to deny that the truth is not what is in the other books. There is no disgrace in the truth."
3,A man with a grudge and a pen,"It would be fair to say that the members of the patrol, those who lived, didn't agree on the events. But they didn't attack the other members of the patrol either, there were disagreements but nothing to get particularly upset about. Having read all three of the accounts written by members of the patrol I was never under the impression that they were destroying the characters of the dead, it takes a book like this to do that.I'm sorry that Mr Asher is upset about how his friends died. But I don't think this does anything positive for their memory."
2,pro islam,"Eye opening, quite a difference from the original book, it's obvious that Ashser is pro islam, In several instances he quotes that arabs don't lie when they take the name of GOD. Yet in the koran, it's acceptably to lie and deceive if promotes islam. It shows to what degree arabs will go to obfuscate the truth."
4,Fast Paced Horror in the Old West,"This manga is a wonderful start to a series. The main character is a Priest who cursed God, and sold half his soul to a demon. In return, he was given immortality, and a quest to destroy a rival demon.These facts are only sparringly revealed through short flashbacks, and this helps add to the drama. However, drama does not appear to be the main focus of this series. The focus is on action and no-holds-barred fighting, all of which takes place in a western setting.This book is almost cover-to-cover action, from train hijacking to assaults by the undead. It is definitely not for younger readers due to the vast amounts of blood-letting, but there is no real carnage beyond this. Still, the book's suggested audience is 16+, and I whole-heartedly agree.Beyond the violence, this is a great opener to what promises to be a very memorable series."
3,"Zesty, mindless destruction for blood-thirsty readers!","'Priest' Vol.1 is a very unique manga. Its got shoddy animation, which is sometimes difficult to decipher, and the storyline is a bit unoriginal (kill as many people as you can). However, the animation does make the story much more intense and pleasurable to read, and I do love the gunfights you read in the book.Overall, it's decent. It lacks consistent plot, mainly all you see is the guy shooting people or talking to Satan. But, the scene on the train is truly awesome- read this when you're angry, and you'll undoubtably feel like shooting someone, so only read this when you can control your sanity.I can't really say it's a classic, but it is definitely one-of-a-kind, despite its shaky plot and storyline. Oh, by the way, its rated OT for a reason- TONS of people die in this manga."
2,Plot?,"Plot is for wooses!Who needs a plot when you have zombies, demons, blood, guns, zombies, gore, bullets, zombies, psudo-religion and plenty of death?Oh, did I mention zombies?Hopefully it will not remain like this in the next book, but after the first I doubt that I'll check it anyway."
4,Must have for any Bob Mould fan,"Highly recommended for any Bob Mould fan. Among the better concert DVD's I've seen in a while, very clean & crisp audio and video production. Concernt footage provides topical overview of Sugar, Husker Du, and solo work with emphasis on most recent album release. Extra's include interviews with Bob and bandmates."
2,Bob M.,"Ahhhh, well something is missing.I love all of Bob's work and seen him in concert,but there is a lack of energy and I did not feel it.I saw Bob acoustic and that was great, but this DVD,well did not do it for me.Still a big big fan."
4,A fine re-issue,"I like detail---and accuracy of detail, especially when it comes to firearms. However, a better editor might have fixed the shakey references to hot-rodding an American Cadillac engine, and there were a few typos and grammatical lapses. Otherwise, Doolittle is a treasured find!"
1,Stink,"The perfume stank. The company did offer to take it back at a discount and a credit for another item, but I did not trust them. I gave the perfume away and even that person tried to give it away, nobody wanted it. Do not buy this product and check the store's return policy to."
3,shipping and book in good condition,"""The shipping was fast and the book was in good condition, although i really haven't wanted to make anything out of it as it had unique and differant kinds of recipes i wouldn't make!"
2,not a good fit,This was a bit to big in the bodice for me and the cups did not fit as I hoped. I am a natural 32DD/DDD and I need much more support. Had to return.
2,"Good cleavage, bad tummy","This bustier made pretty good cleavage, but the boning was awkward. It pressed in just under the bust to push up for cleavage, but then the boning stuck out at the bottom. The boning that went over the ""love handles"" to enhance the natural waist definitely enhanced the natural waist, but the love handles grew. I have a long torso, and even I couldn't sit comforatably (especially when the boning in the front got caught on my other clothing since it stuck out so far). So if you have an average or short torso, do not buy. If you have a long torso with very little plumpness on your body, I'm sure this product will be perfect for you because it enhances cleavage well."
3,This is LOUD.,"This whistle is LOUD - so loud that I didn't find it very usable even in a decent-sized park in the city.I think there could be a bit more variability in the tones, and it is nearly impossible to tell which side has the ball and which doesn't - not ideal when you want to act fast. The shape of one side should be different or there should be some other way to quickly tell them apart.NOTE: The point of this whistle is NOT to stop barking - it is to signal your dog. If you want to stop barking, it should be a part of more comprehensive training. Look up books by Karen Pryor to get started."
3,EVERYTHING IS NOT AS IT SEEMS,"The medical accounts in this book are interesting at times, but if your in the medical profession, frankly you'll find that boring. Dr. Helzner adds a great deal of information for dramatic effect as they say in hollywood. As one, personally related to this effort I can relate that, this is a one sided account of his practice, as a matter of fact I'm sure his legal troubles are not yet over if those he writes about recognize themselves. This is a fairy tale!!!!!!"
5,great,"it is ashame that a book whose profits go to a scholarship fund for Afro-American gets anything but 5 stars. the book was interesting, well written, and enlightening. It is too bad that somebody who has a personal vendetta doesn`t review the book,but reviews what is no doubt their own internal viewpoint. great book dr h!"
4,A great book for 1 & 1/2 year olds and up.,"This book is a great adjunct to the TV show. As new parents we are just learning about ALL the kids shows. We can't stand the Purple Dino, So we like Tele-Tubbies and such. We discovered this show on the Disney Channel and Our child likes The Big Bear, Luna the Moon, and all the songs.As for the Flaps, as all parent know or will find out, little kids will pull them off if not watched when they play with the books on their ownShe can already find all the characters by name and loves to point to them as we say the names, since she still has a Caveman vocabulary."
5,Great Book - AND Durable TOO,"I don't usually do reviews, but this book has survived for 3.5 yrs now which is unusual for the ""lift the flap books"". I have 16 mo twins and my little girl twin likes these kinds of books but finds them to be the ""lift and rip and tear"" books. Not so with this book - the flaps have actually survived her curiosity and destructiveness! And of course, we all love Bear, Tutter and his friends. A worthwhile purchase for your kids library."
4,very nice,"Okay, if your child loves Bear in the big blue house, like mine does, you can't go wrong with this book.It is cute, entertaining and will keep the little bear fan happy for a while.The colors are bright and the entire book is nice, truly a lot of things to see and to point out and hey you can start telling your own story with items you see in the book. Ask your child questions about the items and what bear or Ojo would do with them.BUT...the flaps are really small. I had to wear them in for my little girl. They stick to the pages very tightly and are hard to open or see at first. Like everything else. A couple of times used and it all works much better. But for the eager reade/listener it is a bit frustriating at first.I also find the story a bit short, but hey it is bear.. he rocks and we love him no matter what.Enjoy it, it is a nice book"
2,lid doesn't fit on with filter in place,"The top/lid for this tank just sits on top, but the filter that comes with this clips over the back edge of the tank (hangs inside the tank) and even at it's lowest setting still sticks up too high so the lid sits up on it, which is right in the water stream going over the filter and then the back edge of the lid and top of filter get moldy. Not to mention that the lid's lamp has never worked even though the bulb is good (we tested it) and I think it could have something to do with the huge amount of condensation that collects up there all over everything. Also, the tiny flap that you are supposed to use to put food in the tank through is very small so generally catches some of the food. The shape of the tank is pretty, and the colors are nice for kids, but it's frustrating that the parts don't fit together."
5,Great product,"I've had Packet8 for two months or so. It has been tremendous. I was concerned that voice quality wouldn't be good, but it is great. Setup took just a few minutes. I was amazed that I was making calls after two minutes of setup. I have never had a service outage since I got it.Caller ID doesn't show the name, but that doesn't bother me much, because old phone company's caller ID often didn't show the name."
1,Want a customer service nightmare?,"Beware, while the equipment works alright, the customer service is atrocious. I had packet8 service for several months and decided to go back to a standard landline for quality and bundling issues. I ported my number, and called the cancel my packet8 service. I believed everything was taken care of. Packet8 billed me for 5 subsequent months after the number was ported out, and even after escalating the issue to their supervisors, they refuse to give me credit for the service fees even though there was no number on the account on which to use the service.If you choose to purchase this product, you are warned, you are dealing with an unscrupulous company that is so happy with their terms and conditions that they cannot use reasoning to make a decision."
1,Worst customer service,"I have been using this just for one week and the call quality is the worst. Regret my decision. And when I call for technical service, no one answers even after 45 minutes. Hearing just music."
4,very cute,"These are cute and sexy. Comfortable to wear with great colors. I'm on here ordering more and the cami to match. Cheap price, quick shipping, I have been very pleased. They fit with a low rise, and a wide front coverage. The lace not itchy as I had expected. The only thing not perfect about them is that they fit a little loose on me around the lace on the legs in the front."
5,Buy it every year.,"I no longer have a ferret, but owning this allows me to rekindle fond memories. I have either bought or requested this calendar for Christmas every year. Once, I ordered a competing ferret calendar without understanding the difference between them, only to find the quality of the photos were really rather poor compared to the ones in this calendar. The ferrets in each of the photos here are really amazing. You'd think they were really skateboarding, playing an instrument...or whatever. I have hung select images from previous years in my office at work--and even in my kitchen pantry (one of a ""baker"" ferret!). It's really a cute calendar and you'll always want this brand vs. another once you view it."
5,No Ferrets Were Unhappy Over the Making of this Calendar,"Of course not - these photos are adorable and make you laugh...especially if you've ever lived with ferrets. Jeanne's love for ferrets comes out in her calendars, and the photography (with the use of human themes and props) captures the fun these little guys bring to our lives. I've had one of her calenders hanging in my kitchen each year and each year they get better."
2,Poorly Done Calendar,Not the best calendar ever. I've seen better. Also just learned the dates for some holidays are not correct. I hope next years is better. I give this calendar a D+.
5,Jeanne Carley truly has a gift!,Jeanne Carley had an amazing gift to capture the little subject (ferret!!) on film! Her pictures/scenes far surpass any other ferret calendar on the market. She has an imagination for the unusual and an eye (and patience) to make it a reality!Thank you Jeanne for yet another fabulous calendar....keep 'em coming!
5,This calendar is my life!,"I'm a surgeon and my husband is a superior court judge. We have three little fuzzies and every calendar made by Jeanne Carley. Each one has hung in our bathroom with our life engagements marked each and every day. When we replace it, we lovingly pack it away in a place where it is easily accessible so we can see where we were and what we did on any given day. It's also an excuse to schmooze over the adorable pictures -- pictures that may not show ferrets in their ""natural"" poses, but doing things I know those bright little guys would like to do."
4,Great calendar & Good works,"A great calendar as many others have described, but I also appreciate Ms. Carley's work on ferret legalization, and on education & outreach issues. Keep up the good work!"
5,Calendars So Dear To My Heart,Ferret Music Calendar in one word...Exceptional...I purchased not one but two...Why??? One for work where I spend a great deal of time and one for home of course...All I need to do is look as these spectacular pictures of these gorgeous little critters and one can't help but smile and feel all warm and fuzzy...Only problem when I am at work is that when I look up at my calendar I ache to get home to my own little guys and give them a hug and kiss!!!!!!!!!Just when you think this is the best calendar ever Jeanne Carley tops it the following year with another amazing job.
5,"Charming, Fun, and for a good cause","Jeanne Carley always puts out a wonderful calendar full of delightful ferret photos and 2005 is yet another outstanding example of her artwork. If that isn't enough to sell you, then surely the fact that some of your purchase price goes to help sick and abandoned pet ferrets should certainly do the trick! I am a loyal subscribet for several years. One of the highlights of my year is seeing what crazy ferret pictures she creates for each new calendar.Stephen"
5,"whimsical, humorous, colorful, high quality, artistic work",In my opinion this is the best calander made! I've been buying and enjoying them for years. I even save each year's issue because the photos are so wonderful. They are made by a ferret lover for ferret lovers and can be enjoyed over and over by any animal lover with a sense of humor. They're a high cut above everything else out there.
5,Another wonderful year for the Ferret Calendar!,"I've got every year since the Ferret Calendar first came out and I love them all! I keep them for the terrific photos; they decorate my ferret room year-round (I also have the original screen saver on my computer!) This year's calendar is another winner. I adore the 'opera diva' pictured for September! Jeanne's photos are so superior in their subject matter and quality to the other 'cheesy' Photoshopped ferret calendars, there's just no comparison. Her imagination knows no bounds! Get this one before it's gone!"
5,Great Ferret Calender,"Once again, Jeanne Carley has out done herself with the 2005 Ferret Calender. It is always such a joy to see what kind of photographs she will think of next. Only in these calenders can one of the most adorable animals become even more so. I have one on my wall and look forward to each month and the photo that goes with it. Can't wait for the 2006 calender."
4,I Love the Ferret Calendar!,"As a ferret lover, I get a real kick out of the ingenious and fun ways ferrets are portrayed in the Ferret Company's ferret calendar. For the past four years I have received this calendar as a Christmas gift, and everyone who has seen it has really gotten a kick out of it. If you like humorous photos that capture the quirky characteristics of ferrets, you will love this calendar! They also have some adorable cards and ferret accessories available on their website!"
5,Ferret's Aplenty,"Lots of wonderful photo's, Ferrets are beutiful, and cuddly. I bought this callander before when i lived in an area where i couldnt have ferrets, and i buy it now that i have 3 as well."
5,thanks jeanne!,"i had ordered the ferret calender late , but called jeanne and received my calender before xmas. thank you very much. the calender is great and so are you."
3,more dusting that OEM,braking performance is similar to OEM but I have reservations recommending these pads if you're looking to match nissan/infiniti performance related to brake dust (none) vs these pads (less than standard but more than ceramic from other mfg including oem)
1,For FI cars only,"Disappointing. Says is covers '84 on, but nothing on pre-'88 carb cars, other than a mention that they're orphans. Better advice on the Web for carbed cars. Disappointing."
3,"good info, but not what i expected","Book has some good info, but still leaves a lot of questions. Doesnt cover some of the finer details to actually finish the swap and make it run."
1,Honda Engine Swaps,Don't buy. Waste of money. Simply put. You'd be much better off getting factory service manuals if you want to do it right
3,repetitious,"Bumbling Barthalomew is rescued again and again. The fat proctor eats and eats. They sit around discussing the problem over and over. The author drags in Cynric, the Welshman, from stage right to save the day and then throws him back again. And, oh yes, am sure Cynric would rather be a poorly paid servant to a bunch of disfunctional clerics then work for a wealthy merchant and be his own man. The plots are good but perhaps the author is paid by the word as it could sure be tightened up and be less predictable."
1,This Book is Painfully Ignorant,"This book may have been interesting pop psychology back when it was written in 1988, but anyone who reads it today and espouses its perspective on why men are the way they are is the equivalent of a member of the flat earth society. (And that's not going to get you any women.) Men, you can read this and believe it if you want to, but recognize that you're doing so only because it makes you feel better. That doesn't mean the information in it is true. If you really want to understand why men are the way they are, you'd be better off reading The Blank Slate by Steven Pinker or The Moral Animal by Robert Wright, both of which are 5-10 years old but vastly more intelligent, and accurate, than this book. Those books don't pain a pretty picture, but at least the picture they paint is not a self-delusional one. Warren's book should be reclassified as mythology or recognized as an artifact of old and discarded psychological theory."
1,Awful stereotypical thinking insulting to both men and women,"Where to begin? Bad research (if it can be called that),fallicious reasoning, pandering (quiet genocide, please!), and dated. No women I know read the magazines upon which Farrell has based much of his description of women' attitudes. Nor do they read romance novels, wear makeup, or expect men to pay for their dinner. Men are driven to be successful so they can attract the most beautiful women. What? So men receive no intrinsic satisfaction from being the best at whatever they choose to do? There is so much simplification of this kind in this book. Men and women are complex individuals. Is it not better to approach members of the opposite sex with an open mind rather than a bunch of preconceived cliches which this book promotes?"
3,A Heart Attack Waiting to Happen!!!,"This Cd is so freaking fast, It's like 190-200 BPM, not like other Happy Hardcore which is 165-175 BPM. The one good thing about it: Most of the songs are exclusives, so you won't find them anywhere else. It's so fast, you really gotta slow it down to play it, unless you want to die from a seizure. I didn't really like it. Take my advice, buy something else, like Original Hardcore 2: the Battle, or any of Anabolic Frolic's Happy 2b Hardcore series. Those are way better."
1,Completely incomprehensible,"This book is extremely misleading by title. There is NOTHING in this book to help either identify Netsuke or the artists that carved them. If I wanted to know WHO had written books on Netsuke I would have used a search engine for free. I was under the impression that this was a book about identifying Netsukes NOT a list of everyone that ever wrote an article ABOUT Netsukes.This is probably my own fault-my brain passed over the word Bibliography and stuck on the word ""guide"". I am unsure of who exactly would use or need this book."
4,The best of one of golf's best writers,"Funny stories from this talented writer and lover of the game. Having followed golf from such a priviledged and close position, what makes Jenkins writing so enjoyable to me is his historical perspective. This guy can really put the contemporary players into historical perspective for us."
5,Same towelettes I see used in my doctors office,"I like these towelettes for cleaning around a wounded area and cleaning hands prior to helping a family member bandage a wound. If you have a medical condition that requires cleansing prior to treatment twice a day you can use quite a few towelettes. These appear to be the same ones the nurse uses prior to drawing a blood sample in my doctors office. If it works for them, it should work for me.The reason I purchase them from Amazon is that I have trouble finding them locally. I could drive 20 miles to a neighboring town and stopping at the surgical pharmacy. They always have them but my local pharmacy is normally out of stock."
1,False Advertising!,"The Benzalkonium Chloride product I rec'd was a cheap brand made in China, not the PDI that is pictured. You wouldn't put a picture of a well established brand to sell a less reliable brand of soup or a car or anything else. It certainly shouldn't be done for a health product."
1,Buyer beware!,"I am completely dissatisfied with my purchase with this seller. It says 100/box, which to me suggested I was ordering a box of 100 wipes, not one wipe. I paid 6 dollars in shipping for ONE wipe! Don't be swindled like I was, buyer beware!"
2,I am worried,"The box it shipped it was open. Since this is a medical product, and I have a family member who is immunocomprimised I am worried. Seems it should have shipped more securely."
1,NOT A GOOD BUY >> TO DRY JUST ALL MOST MOIST<<,I SHOULD SAY ALL MOST MOIST .VERY DRY FEELING TO THE TOUCHAND I THOUGHT THEY WERE SUPPOSEDTO BE WET .
4,Dope album....Deep Bass,"I remember this album back in 91. The production is much better on this album as oppose to the ""In the Hood"" album. However this album clearly has more of conscience side to it."
1,very poor customer service,"I loved my first trager backpack. After many years of use it eventually came apart at the seams. I liked it so much, that I bought another. The same thing happened, the seams came apart, but this time it happened almost immediately. I contacted Trager and they asked me to send it in for repair or replacement. I did this. Then I NEVER heard back from them again. I have emailed, called and left VMs and tried everything. They have never responded to me. I now have to buy something else as I have been without the bag I was using every day. I will not buy another Trager product."
4,The Cat Came Back ROCKS!,"The Cat Came Back is one of the funniest animated shorts I have ever seen! I'm not thrilled with the rest of this video (though kids may appreciate it more?) but it's worth every penny just for those few thrilling minutes. A ""must"" pre-movie short for any library."
4,A College Professor With Sparkle,"Art Lee was one of my college professors. This book is exactly like his lectures. You'll feel what it was like to be alive at the time. He was too young to be drafted during World War II. This book tells you of his adventures (good and bad) and his memories (good and bad) during this time, all set with the Norwegian community in which he lived as the back drop. An easy, enjoyable read, but you will go away learning something about life in a small town in the U.S. during the ""big"" war."
5,Required Reading,"This book is brilliant. Seamlessly combining archaeology, history and anthropology, Hans van Wees re-works long-standing notions about the evolution of Greek warfare. In contrast to the works of Victor Davis Hanson, van Wees' theory is amply supported by the historical record and reflects a deep understanding of Greek culture (particularly its often dark and brutal side). It is a portrait of the Greek warrior as he was, rather than Hanson's vision of the Greek hoplite as a reflection of ourselves. It is correspondingly much more convincing, if less flattering to our modern cultural ego."
5,so far so good,O.k. so i bought this for my daughters B-day in dec. So she wont get it until then so i can't accurately tell you how much fun and how educational it is at the moment. I just wanted to comment on the fact that even though it doesn't look exactly the same as the one pictured it is close enough. I did take it out and test it out while my girl was sleeping. It worked beautifly. It popped up with ease and was just as easy to put back in its carrying bag. It seems very sturdy and I think we will have it for a long time even when used outside. It's plenty large enough for two kids. I think four kids could probaly still have a good time inside. My only problem with it is i wish i hadn't ordered it so early cause i can't wait to give it to her!
4,My Little Girl's Castle,We bought this for our daughter's second birthday. She absolutely loves dragging her toys inside and playing in there. The unit is light but very well made and seems like it will last a long time.
2,NOT VEGAN,"We ordered this specifically because it was vegan, however the actual ingredients on the package when it arrived are DIFFERENT than the ingredients on the website. This item now includes ghee and is NOT vegan. Oh well, very disappointing."
1,This Muse is a slumber!,"Actually, I thought I had ordered the CD of the TV show. Unfortunately, it wasn't. Amazom staff admitted that the pics on the sell page were misleading. We've listened and it's not worth much. Curious how a TV sound track can be so engaging and another CD so trite and shallow. Buyer beware."
1,Boring,"I was not pleased with this purchase. The music is not to my liking, monotonous and boring. I blame no one but myself because I did not know this artist when I purchased the CD. I thought it would be new age, like Enya, but it's not like her at all."
5,Great CD,"This CD has become my last best new CD. This CD made me buy 2 more Loreena CDs from Amazon,and I feel this one is the best,"
3,"Good, but not great!","Not as impressed with this CD as all her others. It's still good, but not ear grabbing!!"
4,ENYA WILL NEVER BE LOREENA,"Perhaps I could have given this cd 5 stars as some have, but as already mentioned for the time it took to reach us it doesn't quite reach the stars, where her music should take us. I'm listening to it again as I write this. Loreena is a fantastic singer and I will always buy her music because she will never really let her fan's down. She is that good. This cd is still beautiful. My title is as such because as a example Enya who's music I used to look forward to has not had a decent cd in 3 attempts ( which for her is forever ). She's trapped in some creative block and now gimick which she can't get out of. Welcome back Lady McKennitt, we missed you."
5,surprising,I had never heard Loreena before and was suprised. I loved her voice and the music was an impossible combination of celtic and middle eastern. It sounded like something that would have come out of the crusades. It was original and enchanting. I love to listen to it while I'm driving. Brava Loreena!
5,beautiful,i got this cd and after listening to it i went to see her live in concert and the music was more beautiful in person live then the cd thou the cd is still very beautiful
4,Another Skillfull Tapestry,"Reviews for ""An Ancient Muse"" seem mixed between those who expect some radical new departure from Ms McKennitt, or from fans who will love everything she does. This sounds odd, but I think of her as being in a similar space to Sting. Quite out of the over-stimulated mainstream, where people expect more outrageous heights and highlights every time an artist hires a studio.An Ancient Muse fits into a slowly developing style, but with craftsmanlike fingerprints that go back to the earliest McKennitt work available. This album is a welcome contribution from an artist unlike any other, and the mix of folk, celtic background, mysticism, romanticism, and an eastern slant would sound great, even if this was the first I had heard of McKennitt's work."
3,Sad Muse,"This music is slow, sleepy and lacks the lilting emotional adventure of other albums. Pleasant enough but nothing in particular seems to stand out which makes this collection very forgettable."
4,An Ancient Muse,"Gave this CD as a gift to my son who had driven clear from middle of PA to near Gloucester, MA to see her perform it in concert. I know it will be loved and appreciated."
5,Loreena is fabulous,"After recently attending a concert of Loreena McKennitt promoting this album, I purchased this. It's not the same as being there, but pretty darned close. :)The music on Ancient Muse is a trip down Silk Road and sampling of music found there. How can one truly describe the rhythm and beats of the music? You can't. But if you are a fan of Loreena's previous works, you will like this one as well."
4,Great album,"This is my first Loreena McKennitt album. I am thoroughly enjoying the music; however, I wasn't expecting the middle-eastern influence. The music still has a celtic sound to it, but not quite as much as I had hoped. Her voice is as beautiful as I have ever heard, and the music is very moving and wonderful. A great work. The only reason for 4 versus 5 stars is that it wasn't exactly what I expected. But hey, that's a sign of a good artist."
5,LOVE IT!,Loreena McKennitt has gone all out and combined the celtic style with a middle eastern flair. SO GOOD. if you like Loreena McKennitt I would definately get this album. If you're looking for some good music to relax too and you like celtic music then you should get this album. I love to listen to it when i'm reading or studying. LOVE IT
4,Coverted to (Celtic) Folk Music,"After seeing this lady on PBS and then just having to get thie CD, I am a true convert! While I'm not crazy about the first cut on the disk, I am mesmerized by the remainder and have intrigued my co-workers with new choice of music in my office. Loreena has a most ethereal and soothing quality to her voice. I cannot wait to acquire more of her music."
5,all over cultures,"The artist ,Lorena McKennitt, know how to integret classical musical culters, together with poetry to an plesent and hearable music. we realy not based on the pentatonic chinees music, or the complicated arabic-jewish poetry that had written in meadavel spain , 1000 years ago ."
4,More of the Loreena we love,"While not significantly different from her previous two releases, An Ancient Muse is just as good and will sweep you away into her lush world. The Middle Eastern rhythms and traditional Celtic tunes take you on a musical journey through the world of the Celts. Put it on repeat, light some candles, and go on the journey with her.The only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is because it contains DRM that prevents you from loading it into iTunes and taking it with you. I believe that if you buy music, you should be able to do what you want with it as long as you are not giving it away to someone who would otherwise have bought it."
3,No new journey here,"Loreena's music, for me, has always taken me to new places in the musical landscape. Sadly, An Ancient Music takes no new paths. Many of the songs are very similar to some of Loreena's past efforts. Even so, it is still Loreena, and that is worth 3 stars."
2,just another run of the mill effort,"sorry lorrenna, noit your best work. it is tired and overdone. remix her other albums and you get this one. not worth the money"
3,"Very good, not as spacey as other LMcK titles.","I liked the music, but wish there were more songs with more long spacey rythyms. I still like Loreena's music. A good effort - those who like Celtic sounds or other McKennitt music will like this album."
2,Too repetitive...,"I am a big fan of Loreena, but I have to say that most of the songs of this album are very repetitive and dull. You can hear the same melody over and over. Most of the songs are very long and hearing the same melody all the time makes everything very boring. On the other hand, I don't know why they decided to add drums to most of the songs. It breaks all the magic atmosphere of her previous albums.Very disappointed."
3,I miss the Fire,"I was really hoping for more of the middle eastern essence of ""The book of Secrets"". #5 is good and makes me want to move and drum, which is what I was looking for. The other songs are beautiful, crooning ballads, and good for that mood. What can I say? I don't think Loreena McKennitt could do anything except enchanting mesmerism. When will her next be out?"
1,OBNOXIOUS,"I've been a fan of Loreena McKennitt, but this one was a negative shock. To begin with - ONCE I was forced to play ""An Ancient Muse"" on my portable CD player, I still found that while my back was turned, she hasn't done anything by way of building on what she'd started. To make matters more obnoxious, every time I tried to play the darned CD on my computer, I only got directed to Ms. McKinnitt's self-agrandizing WEBSITE. Not nice, and my system is pretty much set up to play what's thrown up there.I wish I'd had a chance to preview the latest. Had I been given the chance, I would have passed! So much for trust in consistency! I DO hold out hope for the DVD she's supposed to be putting out in March. It begins w/ a piece that I've loved for years. Go figure.If you haven't bought the ""vintage"" Loreena, I DO suggest you do so - if her website doesn't block you from previewing you from previewing her earlierm and much better stuff. I recommend ""The Mask and the Mirror"" for starters.Barb Taylor"
3,"Happy to Listen, but Want More","I was very excited to receive this, being another LMcK fan that's been waiting 10 long years. I enjoy this recording, especially at sunset, but I agree with some other reviewers that it lacks something. All the songs are slow, and seemingly weave into one another so that the entire CD seems to be one song. The only break comes from ""Beneath a Phrygian Sky"", which oddly echoes the ""Bonny Swans"". There are other references to M&M throughout. It's beautiful, yes, but it doesn't really take flight. PS: I also love her adaptations of poems like ""The Highwayman"" and her renditions of Shakespeare, but here it is mostly all her own words. I think Qntal has taken over in the ""adapting famous poems"" department (ie: Ozymandias)."
3,A lesser effort from a musical genius,"I have nothing but the highest praise for Loreena and her amazing band, That said this is no Mask and Mirror. I can't fault the execution by the musicians or the production quality, it all comes down to lack of memorable passages. There is just nothing here that isn't immediately forgetable even if it is nice while being played. nothing bad just nothing new."
3,Sacred Shabbat and Uska Dara,"I bought a couple of copies of this CD when it was released, one as gift for my wife and one for a friend of ours. Overall, I enjoy it, but not as much as some of her other works.One thing that troubles me; Loreena McKennitt takes a writing (music) credit for the song Sacred Shabbat. However, the tune is a Turkish folk song called Uska Dara, which was covered by (of all people) Eartha Kitt and can be heard on some music sites. I spent a lot of time in Turkey growing up and I recognized the tune on An Ancient Muse."
4,She seems sad,"I love Loreena McKennitts music, she usually takes me away from the everyday ho hum. This CD is good, but I feel sadness in it from her."
3,an ancient muse...,"I like the CD as I like this kind of music, but it seems a little slow and repetative of some of her others."
5,Another Hauntingly Beautiful Album,"Loreena McKennitt has done it again. I love this album. While there are some similarities to Mask and Mirror, this one still stands on its own. It's lovely and satisfying."
3,The Contractual Obligation album,"I have loved Loreena's music as long as I have known it and that has got to be around sixteen or seventeen years now. In fact when I bought Elemental I think that was the only thing of hers you could find. Every other album of hers I would give a perfect FIVE STARS. However this album seems forced to me, somehow she is just not in it the way she was immersed in the other albums. I would still cut off an arm or other bits of anatomy for a chance to meet her or hear her play in concert.Note: on this album I am particularly fond of track number 8."
4,Ethereal,"Loreena McKennit, although Canadian, has the Irish faerie voice down pat. She combines Enya with Middle Eastern influences and comes up with some of the most dream inducing melodies. I ordered ""An Ancient Muse"" and ""Buddha Bar XII""Vol. 12-Buddha-Barfrom ImportCDs, who delivered this and other purchases quickly and on time. It's always wonderful to have that kind of service."
5,"Great album, Great Singer!","Love this album! I can't say enough about this woman's voice (and music). Amazing! I saw her in concert years ago and she is just as good in concert as she is on her albums. If you get a chance to see her in concert (not sure when she will be touring in North America again), it is well worth it.Her lyrics are also very original and you can tell she has put a lot of thought into them, not just put words together so that they rhyme.My favorite songs on this album are Penelope's Song and The English Ladye in the Knight. I can still remember her ending the concert with Penelope's Song. Just beautiful.If you are a fan of her previous albums, give this album a chance. I think you'll like it."
4,Has Some Good Music,Most reviewers like this CD; I agree it is with the purchase price if you like her music. It's probably her second or third best music (I like Secrets best).
2,Disappointment,"Compared to her earlier cds, after waiting all these years, I was sorry I wasted my money. I was looking for more of her ballad type of songs and lerics. After playing it thru three times I took it out of my changer and put it on the shelf. Her voice is just as wonderful but the content of this cd sucks."
2,Same Old .... Same Old,"I was very disappointed with this disc. After nearly ten years without recording new music, McKennitt does not give the listener much to go on. I felt most of the songs sounded tired and mournful. She surely hasn't updated her sound much. Many of the songs had long, dull introductions to them. I kept wondering when McKennitt might sing something. Her voice is still in fine form. Hopefully the next time around there will be a shorter wait with some new ideas for her music."
2,Not up to standard,"I LOVE Mckennitt's music in general, I own all her cd's her video etc. This album (long awaited as it was) is just not up to snuff. Every track sounds similar, with no unique songs that really stand out as outstanding. I was very unhappy with this recording. I hope her next effort is more reminiscent of her earlier excellent works."
1,Good luck getting this to play,Evidently there is some kind of copy protection on her cds that make it near impossible to play them on your computer CD-ROM drive.All you get is a connection to her website where they advise you to right click on the drive and then click run. WRONG. Just takes you to her website and seemingly impossible to get the CD to play. I am furious at wasting money like this.
2,An income provider for McKennitt but little value for the listener,"I bought this album thinking that it would be on par with her others. It is not. Disappointingly not. If you are a McKennitt fan, I am guessing that you buy her music for her expressive voice and lively music. This had very little of either to offer. The album is predominated with overused Middle Easterm melodies and offer very little voice or are melodies with a few vocal sighs. Some of the ""songs"" are almost totally this genre and some of the melodies are tired since she has used them exhaustingly before, but with livlier results. The predominance of music and lack of her usual freshness gave me the impression that she was just filling space to make an income on this ""new"" issue. Don't waste your money."
4,Ancient Muse Review,"This is classic, recognizable McKinnett. If you are a fan, you'll like it. If you are not, you will say, ""What's new?"""
5,Lorena McKennit-Ancient Muse-beautiful music,More of Lorena McKennit's awesome talent. As good as anything she has done before with a broader cultural appeal.
5,Another relaxing and surreal moment with Loreena McKennitt,"I have been waiting for another CD from Loreena McKennitt. And it was well worth the wait.This CD is just as beautiful and wonderful as all the rest of her CD's have been. She creates moments of bliss and wonderment.Thanks, Loreena, for another wonderful CD."
4,Beautiful Music,"It's hard to believe so many years have gone by since McKennitt's last release. She is back in superb form with another expertly produced recording. The shift from ""Book of Secrets"" is subtle and becomes more apparent after repeated listening. The production is stripped down and there is more clarity to the arrangements with just a hint of letting go on a few of the tracks. McKinnett is a journey man and her music reflects her never ending searching for meaning and connection to different cultures and the past."
4,Fans will want it,"This CD picks up where she left off in Book Of Secrets. Its good and I like it a lot but there is something missing. Most of the songs are slow, not like on the last two. Also she is basically covering familiar territory. By this is mean that a lot of the music sounds much like thelast two CD's. This is basically a continuation of what she did in Secrets. Overall, its a fine CD and her voice is great but no new musical territory is explored here."
3,red wine,I did not realize the record was a vynel 33 1/3 rpm . Thought it was CD.I have no equipment to play that record type.
2,"Horrible Horror, Hilarious Comedy!","Ok, so I'm a fan of bad horror. Even still, this one had me laughing so hard my sides hurt. Bad acting, low budget, and such exagerate stereotypes you won't know if you should be mad, or laughing. I chose laughing!! For folks who like B horror, please check this one out. For those of you who are sensative to having your unofficial title of being 'Goth' being made fun of. Don't watch. At either rate, don't spend too much on this one. But it is definitely worth a look if you like laughing at B movies."
2,More Like GOTHSWILL...As In Garbage.,"I had hopes for this one based on the 2 reviews posted in the Amazon listing, but those guys must be on the payroll `cause this flick`s a joke. Low budget,shot on video, badly acted, poorly scripted, ugly guys and women you don`t really wanna see naked are all that`s on parade here - that`s probably why the cover is a painting/illustration and not a shot from the actual movie. Horror? No. Comedy? The joke`s on you. Do your self a favor, have a turpentine enema instead - it`ll be less painful."
5,Love this item!,"I got this puppy playpen to try out, and oh my goodness what a difference it has made in my breeding program! It is easy to keep clean, the puppies learned to go on puppy pads, the ease of taking care of the puppies has been excellent. I would reccommend this to anyone serious as a breeder.Debbie Marshall [...]"
4,Magnificent Failure,"I enjoyed Craig Ryan's informative chronicle of Nick Piantanida's life and dreams. He has provided an honest and insightful perspective on his character, his courage, and even his flaws. I have long felt that Piantanida's achievements had been unfairly ignored. It was especially troubling that during the build up to and during the narrative of Baumgartner's stunning record flight, not one word of credit was uttered regarding Piantanida's record flight and the price he paid. Thanks to Craig Ryan for his work in providing a record of an amazing life."
5,Unexpected Surprise,"I picked this book up at a local Dollar Tree for, what else, one dollar. I'm not completely sure on how that reflects on the book itself. No matter where I purchased it, the story of Nick Piantanida and the Strato-Jump project is just incredible. I am not a baloonist, parachutist, or anything even remotely related, but Nick's story is inspiring no matter who you are. This is one of the best books I have read in the past year. No matter where you find this book, pick it up! Also, the photographs are great! Highly recommended."
5,I think his pictures are beautiful...,This book had the most beautiful pictures of horses that I have ever come across. I would love to be able to draw just like him. I loved how he told about how great the friendship was. And how they worked out their problems together. I want to write and draw just like this someday.
1,Half a Mind Is a Terrible Thing to Waste,"Mind numbing tome is undoubtedly to be used as text book. Pedantic, long winded, and ill conceived, the book further insults its reader by costing a great deal of money. May it moulder unopened in university libraries."
2,Yikes,"I love a lot of Kurosawa's films and his worst is probably better than some directors' best. But The Idiot, in my opinion, really misses its mark. The beauty, depth and humor of the original Dostoevsky novel are totally lost in this film version. (Perhaps they would be in any film version.) I found the acting of the lead character in particular, to be stilted and even a bit ridiculous. Kurosawa somehow turned a rich, dynamic and very realistic psychological exploration into a weepy melodrama. And I can't imagine the film will seem much better if you haven't read the novel. You are much better off buying the book, one of the most perfect, profound and entertaining stories ever written, and leaving this movie alone."
3,Certainly among the great works of Literature,"I have read the works of greats such as Shakespeare, Tolstoy, HG Wells, Huxley, Coulter, Nixon and O'Reilly but this book can definitely give these authors a run for their money. I was definitely impressed with breadth and candidness and learned a lot about one of my boyhood heroes, the Hulkster. You better believe it brother!"
5,Hulkamania rools sucka!,"Me and my tag team partner hulk hallgan think this book is our cup of tea! If u do not like this book our 24"" inch pythons we aint talkin bout our arms and our little hulkamaniacs will run wild on you! POO POO POO POO POO POO POO POO POO POO POO POO IM A REAL AMERICAN FIGHT FOR THE RIGHTS OF EVERY MAN I AM A REAL AMERICAN FIGHT FOR MY RIGHTS FIGHT FOR MY LIFE!"
4,Not bad,"I saw this years ago when it came out.. its not bad...bad acting and special effects.. but its a Lamas film, right? Comes with the territory.Kathleen's body is rocking in this...Okay film for the Lamas fan."
3,Hmmmm,"I was not thrilled with this book. Many of the ideas are useful (but not something most of us don't already know) in the short run. I think that most physicians would have serious concerns about many of the ""tips"" provided. Overall I didn't find new or exciting ideas in here. Much of the book is made of charts that can easily be obtained online at no charge. I feel that this book was not really worth the money. I would suggest passing on this purchase or at least buying a used copy for as little money as possible."
1,Let's forget this ever happened.,"This is, quite simply, the worst thing to ever happen to music (or human beings really). A horrible fad that got taken to new levels. All parties involved should be ashamed."
5,Timelessly iPod,"This was the soundtrack that Apple really wanted in their iPod pitch. This is like starbucks 2099. I love it. If you enjoyed those Susan Vega joints[back in the day], then just point, click, purchase, and I'll read your review later."
3,Not what I thought it was,"I thought this song was gonna be what it was in ""Can't Hardly Wait"", but it wasn't. But, it's still pretty cool. Kind of Bjork-esque, but not too much. You just kind of have to be in a certain mood for it. I really only like the 1st song, but it's still bareable, which is why I gave it 3 stars. Hey, for 3 bucks, why not?"
1,Not the same quality as the rest of the series,"It's rather inevitable, since it's not about Kabuki, the character for whom the entire setting was conceived, but this book completely loses the tone, artwork, and characterization of the other books in the series. The character is uninteresting; the elegance, cadence, and symbolism of the writing is gone; the setting is totally unrelated; and the artwork can't compare to David Mack's. Fans of 'Circle of Blood' deserve better."
3,Dark Breed,"The movie was pretty good, not too many movies have I watched that I didn't like, but what I LOVED MOST about this particular movie was the song that played all the way though it - ""You're The One"" - I have NO idea who sings it, I couldn't even find it in the credits, I suppose it was written exclusively for this movie, a crying shame, because it is TO DIE FOR! I would buy it in a heartbeat! Anyone who might have information you can share with me on this song would be greatly appreciated!"
4,A Telling Snapshot of the South,"The nuances and details picked up in the book are so familiar, and is a testimony to Naipaul's power of acute observation. Anyone interested in a quick yet meaningful snapshot of the South's mindset will find this book both informative and very enjoyable reading. The book delves into many of the issues and stereotypes that grip the South and brings out the complexities that sorround those issues. Overall a sympathetic look at the South, but also a quick rejoinder to Southerners that some of their attributes are not so charming and are in fact a detriment to intellectual and economic progress."
3,always an interesting perspective,"Naipaul went on a brief trip to the South of the US and wrote a travellogue on it. While I do not believe it is as good as the ones he has written on India and Islam, it was well worth the read. What he concentrates on is the struggle of people to realise themselves, to find an identity in the chaos of modern life. As he sees it, the plight of American blacks is very moving indeed, and beautifully written as always.I think that where a lot of people get critical of this book is that they expect it to be academic and somehow definitive, rather than so personal. Naipaul is a novelist, so what you get is anecdote and impression, rather than a comprehensive approach. If that is what you expect, this is a very fulfilling reading experience.REcommended."
1,Zero Stars,"This thing is a piece of junk. It is super flimsy, tips over very easily. Overall a complete waste of money. If there were an option for zero stars, I would give it! Don't waste your money. I am sure you could find something at the Dollar Store that is better than this thing!"
5,Get Organized is a great place to shop,"I disagree with the poor reviews. The tablemate meets its purpose. I think it is great. Get Organized sent it by standard shipping and it arrived as anticipated which was 10 days. Not bad. I am very satisfied with my tablemate. I use it to hold my laptop computer, but I have the option to use it as a table for ""breakfast in bed"" if I so desire."
1,DONT ORDER FROM - GetOrganized,"Two weeks later.... still no tray. My kids watch allot of TV. This was the MAJOR gift my daughter wanted for her birthday. Strange, I know, but we home school and this would be handy. Well, we ordered it from GetOrganized two weeks in advance... they gave a phoney tracking number, and still no product. Customer service for this company NO HELP. We will file an A - Z claim and report them to Amazon. Other sellers have this, and we suggest you try them instead! SAY NO TO GetOrganized"
4,"Works as advertised, not a revolutionary table","I eat dinner in front of the TV most nights, so this table has been quite useful. I never really use the angled settings, but I see no reason why they wouldn't work as advertised. The table stays flat 100% of the time for me and doubles as a surface for my laptop when I'm ""televisiphonernetting."" I wish this product came in black to match my room's decor and that's the only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars."
3,portable stability,"these tables are nice and do not take of much space...My snacks, dinners, and laptop enjoy the tables"
4,table mate,This table comes in handy on a daily basis. It is sturdy enough to place my laptop on and very easy to use.
4,Table mate 2,This product is pretty much as advertised. I think there's probablysomething like it at walmart or some other store like that. It doesits job and we do use it. Thanks.
3,The Table Mate II is fair,"I can not give this table any higher rating than 3 stars. The table is a little flimsy. My wife uses it to hold her laptop. Or, she did use it. I did not trust putting anything on it that weighed more than a few pounds."
3,table mate II,"Shipped on time, over priced. The box says ""Like as seen on TV"" it is even lower quality than ""as seen on TB"". Recommend not purchasing this product."
1,"Terrible product, terrible service","If there was a rating of 0 I'd give you that. As a Canadian ordering from Wonderfulbuys.ca has been a Christmas nightmare for me. Ordered 3 tables, out of stock, failed to mention that to me, received them on January 4th. Put them all together and one by one the pins broke off on every table. Now trying to get an order of pins and they are out of stock.If this is all it takes for these tables to fall apart, then I don't really want them. Putting your own screw on is not much help if you'd like to adjust them or fold them up to put them away.A terrible product, don't buy this."
2,Wobbly,"I wanted this product so I could work on my laptop while at the sofa. It would be everything I needed if it was not made with such cheap materials. The light weight aluminum legs coupled with the light weight plastic tray top makes the table so wobbly that working on it is very annoying. For the price, this item is not worth it. If you can find a similar design made with sturdier legs, and a heavier material for the tray top, then I would recommend giving that a try instead.I had no problems with the sellers, it came fast and in good condition."
5,Table Mate,"Initially, I bought 2 Tablemates out of curiousity. I liked it so much over the last 2 years I bought 12 more and gave them out as gifts. When I just reviewed other people's comments I couldn't believe that anyone would find fault with this product. I actually read all those reviews because recently I started having problems with the table not sliding smoothly. I wanted to see if anyone else was having this problem. If so, see what they did to fix it. Nobody mentioned it. My daughter suggested maybe I should have left the plastic sleeves on the legs. Well, if anyone does have this problem, I found that waxing the surface that touches the floor helps. I still think it's a great product."
2,Convenient To Use But the Top Can Warp Easily,"The top is all plastic and even though it's rated to hold up to 50 lbs., you'll notice it sags in the middle with as little as a 7 pound laptop on it (that's what I use it for).I'd give it 5 stars for convenience if it weren't for this and the fact that the TableMate website has NO contact telephone number - and does NOT respond to e-mails inquiring about a replacement top - it's supposed to have a lifetime warranty against breakage, bending, etc.Mine has developed a permanent warp to the point that my mouse won't even lay flat. A steel shim molded into the top's perimeter lip would have made for a much more rigid design."
2,Good but the adjustable angles are not well designed,"I like it friendly and handy but the angles for the table are limited. Only 3 adjustable angles and they are not good, the angles are too deep that computer and the mouse can slide out the tray."
3,Table Mate II,"Table Mate II is very handy for getting up close to you when sitting on the couch. That is what we were looking for. We also think the tray itself is a little bit too flimsy. We realize the way the table is made is lightweight, but would like to have it a bit more sturdy."
3,Problems With Tablemate II,"I was so anxious to get this. I was adjusting the height upward by pressing the two metal buttons protruding from the holes in the legs, and the metal buttons disappeared and fell out of the leg. The little buttons are on the end of a spring-type clamp. It broke on my third or fourth time to press them. I put a screw in the holes. It works, but you can't adjust the height anymore. That was very disappointing, but I really do like the idea of the tablemate. I feel it should be a little stronger and should be able to adjust to a higher position for tall folks like me."
4,Works for a laptop table,"I bought this table to use with my laptop while sitting on the couch or chair in my living room. It works nice for this purpose. I agree that the materials used to make the table are not quite worth $30 (I got mine on ebay for $23 and that was with shipping). The legs are not as sturdy as I'd like (they kind of wobble back and forth) but they do the job. I do like how legs go under the furniture and I can get comfortable on the couch. Overall, it works for what I'm using it for and I'd probably buy it again."
4,I love it!,"This is one of the best purchases I have ever made. Very convenient. I purchased it so I could use my laptop in my livingroom. My computer gets very warm on the bottom and my legs can only take so much. The TableMate adjusts to the perfect height and is so light and easy to use I can take it anywher in my house. There are only a couple of drawbacks if you are planning on getting the TableMate:1)It isn't very easy to adjust the height. You have to carefully push two spring loaded pins in, slide the legs and re-align the pins to the holes. It isn't hard to do, by any means. It just isn't as easy as I hoped.2) The spill-proof rim that goes around the table surface is really hard on the wrist when using my computer. I had to put an insert in to cure this.Other than that, this is a great product. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for an item like this."
1,Beware,This item is ordered through GetOrganized. You have to pay to speak with customer service and they are a nasty little organization to deal with in my experience. I'd look for this item elsewhere.
4,Cool little table,"Very easy to put together. Packaged well and wrapped. Would like it to hold a little more weight, but okay as is, for most things."
4,Many uses,"It wasn't quite as sturdy as I would have expected, but still great for many uses. Very versitle!!"
5,Just the thing.,"Whenever I used my laptop on my lap, it heated itself up, and it heated my lap up (uncomfortably so). Also, when they cleaned out my computer at the shop, the fans had picked up all kinds of gradoo from my clothing and skin.This table eliminates those problems. The computer stays cool, and so does my lap. And my computer doesn't get full of lint. It assembles very quickly with no tools, and it's stable. It works well with my recliner in front of the TV. Recommended."
5,Perhaps one of the 2 best industrial songs of all time,"Covenant is not one of my top 20 favorite bands; in fact, I am not even a huge fan of industrial music; however, I own several Covenant cd's. Why? Because of two songs that Covenant has created: ""Wasteland"" and ""Edge of Dawn"". These two songs are absolutely amazing; they are complete masterpieces. The vocals are some of the best you will ever find for any industrial act, or any band for that matter. Not since Front 242 or Nitzer Ebb have I ever seen anything quite like this."
4,"Squiggly synths and dancing "" to the sound of sirens """,This was one of the first CDs I got of Covenant ( the other was Europa which came in a package that was a lot cheaper where I was than what Amazon has here )Anyway what I'll say is that the sound is good even though the Cryotank track will have some people being impatient since it goes on for almost 26 minutes but it isn't bad - it's quite good really. Another thing is that the singer sounds like Phil Oakey of the Human League and it sometimes fun to think of the Human League Mk1 singing songs like these and Covenant singing the Human League`s back catalogue
2,Beware - extremely cheap paper.,"The paper which fills this ""sketchbook"" is not of a quality befitting the Moleskine reputation, being a plate-surfaced cardstock which looks suspiciously like cheap office-grade xerox paper, peculiarly resistant (because of sizing or some other coating) to ink washes -- not an inviting tableau upon which to work or draw. The design of the book itself, is, however, wonderful; I just wish that the Moleskine company would choose an interior paper that was actually designed for drawing and sketching; this is NOT. (Their regular blank notebook offers a better surface for drawing, though the paper is extremely lightweight.)"
3,Love the Compact Size,"I love the fact that this bench doesn't take up much space. However, the design (despite being a ""tripod"" setup) lends itself to wobbling (has to do with the way the back legs are bolted to the frame) - this could have been designed better and it's distracting. I'll keep the bench but I'm now buying a different full-size bench that is known for its stability and its capacity to do decline presses."
1,Jargon,Like most strategic management course books this book is filled with generic buzzwords and jargon that are worthless for your career and education.
1,Terrible,"This was one of the worst textbooks I have ever been forced to buy. The authors were unorganized in their thought process, and went round and round in circular logic. The concepts were made more difficult by this writing style."
1,Unable to load,"We thought it would be fun as we needed this first version in order to load a newer updated version, but neither load on our new PC, ???"
5,excellent debut,"an absolute Must Buy for industrial collectors, this album (which was originally released in 1993) sounds much influenced by early skinny puppy. very dramatic and raw; there are quite a few minimalist tracks woven through spooky samples (mostly from the ""aliens"" movie) which often build into very powerful electronic rythms. it also contains some excellent EBM tracks, including the original ""eye over you"" and the club hit ""slugbait"". as a word of caution though, this album has very little in common with their recent work and has considerably more energy and emotion -- so much so that fans of ""less"" might not be able to handle it; this album is a display of genius and is not for the light hearted."
3,A taste of things to come...,"An auspicious debut... haujobb, while still fresh from the womb, musically speaking, deliver a hard assault on the eardrums. It's a long road from here to their later work, and you can certainly hear the Skinny Puppy and Lether Strip influences, but there's a certain quality to this disk that shines through. Tracks like Homes and Gardens and Skullfission are a pointer to future greatness.A word to the wise... this cd is poorly mastered... I'd give it a 4 if it was remastered to the level of the later material."
1,Dissapointing,"I have seen Kevin Eubanks use this technique. He has a small section in one of his books dedicated to this. I had hoped that this book would expand on this but it does not. This book needs some pictures to explain this stuff more clearly and much more explanation, it is vague, and is not worth buying at all. It is better to save your money for a bass book that truly explains this or maybe take some lessons with a bass player. I will avoid this authors books."
1,I really wanted to like this book.....,"I wanted to learn this stuff. I wanted to like this book. Unfortunately, I wholeheartedly have to agree with the other review. Thank God I got this book used and not new."
5,Awesome stuff - not for pinheads,"Yes he's fast! No he doesn't ""explain"" it all. But there's both tab and a CD. So just practice and eventually you'll get it!What were you knuckleheads expecting? Someone to actually play it for you?For those of you with a brain and some playing abilities, this book will definitely open up some new avenues."
1,Trash,I made the mistake of buying this and the authors classical themes books. The cd that came with the classical themes book was sampled! This guy didnt even play it. This author is a joke.
3,stop stealing sheep,"It's a fun little read. There's some interesting play with typography, although nothing particularly special. I was also told that those who had been quoted were not told that their words were being used in the book. But overall, it's a nice little book, a good compilation of quotes and enough to get me off my butt and go do my typography homework."
4,GREAT QUOTES.....,This book has a huge amount of great quotes nicely layed out and graphically done. It is a bit hard to read some of the pages but it is still a great bok to have.
5,"Advice, What's it Worth ?","Throw out all the magazines and tips books you have bought andcommit yourself to really changing, that is the message of this bookand it will tell you exactly how to go about it. I love to listen to Dr. Bob in the car when traveling to the range or golf course because he will put you in the mind to play golf or focus you on your game improvement needs. I rate the tape highly because I needed the information and have improved my game because I followed some of the advice given on the tape. It was the best money I have spent on Golf Improvement in a long time. END"
3,Some dreams are nightmares,"Rotella's, Golf Is Not A Game of Perfect, is a great book that anyone, not only avid golfers, will find interesting and thought provoking. I have bought multiple copies and give them out to friends and my fellow co-workers as gifts. Unfortunately, I did not find, The Golf of Your Dreams, to be of the same caliber. Whereas the former was a crisp read and hard to put down, the latter dragged in many places and seemed to be a rehash of his first book. I am a fan of his first work and hope to see some work from him that can match it in quality and readability."
