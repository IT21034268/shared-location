2,Disappointing,"I am a huge George R.R. Martin fan but I was disappointed by this book. I expected a collection of stories and novellas, but instead got only one novella. The other three ""stories"" were actually a partial novel, a screenplay and excerpts from ""A Game of Thrones."" The most enjoyable parts of this book were George R.R. Martin's introductions to each story. Save your money!"
1,Interesting ideas that fall flat,"I purchased this as a guide to how *not* to write an RPG; I wasn't disappointed. There are many good, or at least interesting, ideas in this book but the overall effect is one of Munchkinism gone awry. It has some positive points such as a surfeit of imagination; however, the overall tone of the book can be inferred by the 'About the authors' at the end, which is as full of hyperbole and imagination as the rest."
5,Great Mormon fiction,"So glad I was introduced to this book as a teenager - it planted a wonderful seed within myself to ""chill out"" about my religion and just enjoy its eccentricities!"
5,Vote Stan!,"I really recommend this cd to all South Park fans. I like its country like sound effects and Cartman's singing has improved, but really I like Stan. If you're a fan of South Park and you're a Stan fan, you'll like the way he sings.If you like South Park and you don't like Stan and you wish he was dead and not Kenny, maybe the way Stan sings'll change your mind."
3,"Not Bad, But Cartman's Singing Is An Acquired Taste","The ""concert"" for Chef that is a South Park TV soundtrack has both its good and not-as-good material. Some of the rap is good (Master P's ""Kenny's Dead"" is a highlight) but see how much you can take of Cartman's version of ""Come Sail Away"". Even for a serious South Park fan, it can be a little much to take."
1,WTF?! BL&U was Actually Good!!!!,"I really like the soundtrack to Bigger, Longer & Uncut, but this completely sucks! At least the movie soundtrack was actually funny while being controversial. This one only has the latter! Avoid like a plague!!!"
5,this c.d. kicks @$$,"buy this c.d. u'm telln' u. even if u dont like south park, u will like this c.d. buy it for cryin' out loud!!!!!!!! it has ur favorite artists. even DMX!!!! get it dammit. the best songs are ""Nowhere to run"" and ""Will they die 4 you"" get it!!!!!"
1,The fall of Hooverphonic continues,"Once Hooverphonic was a great band. Their first album with the brilliant singer Liesje Sadonius was brilliant and also the second album was great with Geike singing quite good. Then came a decent third album with a couple of good moments followed bye a very dissapointing 4. album, a live album I did not want to invest in, and now this even worse album. I have heard it once, and I don't think I will ever hear it again. Not that it is horrible, but it is just not worth spending my time for, and Geike has now lost all the beauty in her voice, and now sings quite badly most of the time in my opinion. I surtenly miss Liesje Sadonius' beutiful voice in this band. Anyone knows what has happened to her? But back to the album and the conclusion. If you did like Hooverphonics first albums best, then do not buy this and be dissapointed once again. But if you did like the 4. album, you will surely also like this."
4,"Old Hooverphonic is dead, long life new Hooverphonic!","The band is changing and this is clearly shows through thier latest album - it is nothing like their first releases. If you enjoyed the original Hooverphonic, you will probably be dissapointed, as you will find ""No more sweet music"" too commercial, almost pop. On the other hand, if you have more traditional tastes, you will probably like this release as it offers a few catchy melodies, more sophisticated sound and a good beat here and there. One item I must agree with another reviewer - the main singer's vocals are somewhat mediocre."
4,Come on people!!,"I need to get my facts straight on this, but I think this was the final release from Albini's wonderful experiment in sonic violence called Big Black. It was also the first record by them that I discovered in the used bin at my favorite local record store, Trader Vic's in Dayton. Later in Chicago I got hold of the VHS recording of this live concert and it is still holding up as one of my better live show recordings. Either you love this kind of stuff or you hate it, but if you are looking for unique hard rocking greatness, you need to catch up with these guys. My favorite was Roland and however programmed those beats!!"
5,Good Buy,"Good buy for the price, they work as well as store bought brands that cost much more. I strongly recommend"
5,How could you go wrong.,This cable works great. Nothing to complain about and it's just what I needed to hookup my new Playstation 3
2,NOT 6 feet,"The only reason why I give this rating 2 stars is because if a company is going to state that a cable is SIX FEET, then when the product arrives, it should be SIX FEET. I'm around 5'4"" and it's less than an inch taller than me. Thanks for the misunderstanding.. BUT, the cable works fine, it arrived before the date as expected and it was cheap. So I'm only complaining about the measurement."
1,Absolutely would not buy again,"Even though it is a cheap cable, still do not waste your money. I tried hooking up my computer and Playstation 3 using the cable and it would only transmit 480 picture quality. It would flicker to 1080p for a few seconds, but then would tell me that the best it could do was 480. Again, I know it's only a couple bucks, but don't waste it on this."
2,Does not work with PS3,"This cable works fine connecting my HDTV to my cablebox, but does not work connecting my PS3 to my HDTV. When I connected the PS3 using this cable I would get frequent flashes and sound static on the TV."
1,HDMI cables,I will not buy anything from any seller on your web site again.Seller did not send the right amount of cables
1,not so good,within one hour of playing my ps3 this cable died on me for what i paid for it i am not requesting to return the item but i would buy another one of them.
2,Garbage cable,"I suppose you get what you pay for... I once thought all HDMI cables were more or less created equal, but I was clearly mistaken. I bought a PS3 two weeks ago, along with this cable. Unfortunately, the cable took a week longer to arrive, so in the meantime I went to Best Buy and bought one of their more expensive cables, with the intention of returning it once the cable arrived. Game play was awesome, as well as audio on the BB cable. On saturday, this cable arrived, and I plugged it in - the video was decidedly more jerky, and audio would cut out randomly. I plugged back in the BB cable, and all worked well... In short, if you're thinking of using the cable for 1080p or 3D content... DON'T."
5,HDMI chord for ps3,This chord amazed me for the 4 bucks i bought it for!!! The chord is like a brand new one from best buy but ALOTTT cheaper!!!! id buy this chord if your looking for a hdmi chord!!
4,Great purchase!,"The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the construction of the HDMI cable isn't top notch like that of overly priced Monster Cables (fancy looking plug ends, extra insulation, etc...). But in all honesty, the construction doesn't matter. It's well made for what I paid for it and it does a GREAT job with no setbacks. There is no reason to spend more money on a fancy cable when this one does the same thing. It's a solid, well built, albeit cheap looking, cable that does the job it was intended for. It goes behind the TV so nobody sees it anyways. I'd definitely purchase it again with no regrets!"
5,Good for the price,Very good and a good buy .this is a must if you need one . No problems and they came in time . A must have!
4,Does The Job,This is a basic HDMI to HDMI cable that does what it is supposed to do. Nothing more and nothing less.
1,Poor Quality Cable,"This cable is cheap, but don't think that means you are getting a good deal. I hooked this cable up to my PS3 and my Plasma TV and the signal had a lot of interference. I then hooked up the PS3 with a higher quality HDMI cable, and it worked flawlessly. Don't buy this cable."
1,this cable sucks,"don""t have to say any hing else the picture suck with this cable.used it for my PS3 for about long enough to reset the video options back to the RCA jacks, it was only $2 for a reason. i gave it one star because you have to."
1,MJP,I saw all of the reviews on these cables and the price is right! So I decided to buy three of these cables. The first one I opened had snow on the bottom of the picture. I sent an e mail to the company and they told me to try the other two to see if they work. The second cable had bad snow all over the picture. The third one had a slight snow ( best one out of the three ) but the picture quality was not there. They told me to send them all back for a refund. Its not even worth sending back because of the shipping. DO NOT BUY THESE CABLES!!! I guess you get what you pay for. I can't understand the great reviews that the other customers wrote.
2,It works?,"Sometimes it will not bring me a picture when it is hook up. They have a loose fit with all my HD product (TV, Bluray,PS 3) I have to wiggle the ends to get it to work, and sometimes it work and sometimes it doesnt. I will not buy this product again"
3,There ok,i went to go use it on my cousins xbox 360 and i got lines across the whole thing but so far the other hdmi cable i have is ok.
5,Perfect,"If you are one of those perfectionists who sits around comparing the difference in quality between this cable and one made by Monster or another brand, then i am sure you can find faults with it. I however and your average consumer who needed a HDMI cable and didnt want to pay a lot of one. Hence the reason i bought this fantastic cable which carried a very low price. If it breaks, stops working or catches fire.. then i could buy 8-10 of them at the cost of one really good cable... Or collect the home owners insurance if the fire occurs when i am not home. Either way, Its a WIN/WIN!Quit reading reviews and just buy it ya cheap ...."
1,Great Price!!!////////Not so good of a product,"The price of these cables are great. Any time you can spen $2.00-$4.00 for a pair of HDMI cables, you have just got a great deal. Now, in reference to the quality, please note that these cables are very thin. They do work, but with a major problem. I connected them to my 50 inch LG Plasma television and the picture started to pop in and out. I then tried the Mediabridge Ultra Series and they worked perfect without any problem. I paid about $10.00 for the Mediabridge Ultra Series. In all for the best picture quality, these are not the cables for you. It's worth spending the x-tra $5.00."
1,Cheap but does not work,"This HDMI cable does not send a constant signal to my TV which results in a ""search for signal"" blip every second. Bad quality, do not buy."
5,"Not a game (weird review questions) - great cable, though.",HDMI cables can cost up through (and probably beyond) $80 for 6ft. CRAZY! This little cable performs great (connects between my PS3 and my 1080p TV) for much less. Shipment was a little slow but it got here.
1,Did not work,"Cables did not work. About every 1 second, the TV would blink off, on, flicker, and then go back to the picture. Totally unusable. Ordered 3, and every one was the same. Put my old cable back on, and everything worked perfectly. Will now be testing their return policy."
5,Highly Recommend,"Great price for this cable. Gold tips to resist corrosion. Don't fall for the ""more expensive cable is better"" scam!"
5,HDMI,I purchased these after reading a review that said all the HDMI cables are the same on the inside the only thing you are really paying for is the brand name once I read that I decided to take a gamble and buy these ones and I think my last cables were an easy 20 plus bucks more expensive and they match up with these ones pretty closely
4,Not what I was looking for,I guess it is but its my own fault. My measurements were off and it my cable box that I have don't have a slot for it. Thanks Comcast. ugh!
1,Cable did not work; verifed by confirmation,"As stated, I confirmed that this cable did not work upon arrival. Due to the cheap price, I will not be seeking refund but will remember this in the future."
1,Did not work,"Did not work with my PS3. Caused a lot of interference. Even tried it with two other hi-def players. Displayed a rainbow of colors and froze the picture. Guess at this price, you have to keep your fingers crossed and hope that your cable is defect free. :-("
3,received,"sorry, i do not speak english much but, i do receive perfect the product envoy thank you very mucho, bye."
3,well made,"the connectors where pretty much new. It's was a very standard cable, and for that it made it's propose. Hope i will never, ever need to buy another cable at all."
1,You get what you pay for,"I purchased this cable ... installed cable ... removed cable ... put in trash. Let us think, I spent $1400.00 on large screen LCD TV. $300.00 on Sony playstation. This cable produces image quality of a 1960s black and white TV using rabbit ears. Don't kid yourself spend the money on a quality cable at a local store. Atleast you can easily return the item if needed. DO NOT BUY THIS CABLE."
1,No Audio,"Cheap cables, and maybe mine are broken, but I just received mine and they don't work for audio. Maybe it's not supposed to be but I thought the HDMI to HDMI connection would play audio and video."
1,"""Cheap"" cables?","Works great, can't believe others charge ten times more. Now I know why they call it ""Monster""."
3,"Average quality, doesn't seem to support 1080p","I bought these to use with my PlayStation 3. At first, everything seemed to work fine, but after every 20 minutes, the screen would flicker. Initially, I thought something was wrong with the PS3, but I just bought it the same day. I decided to test the PS3 with another HDMI cable I bought from amazon basics (the one with the amazon logo). After leaving it on for over an hour, the flicker stopped. It never came back. I used these with my Roku player and it works fine, but the player outputs 720p max. I'm thinking this is only good for 720p resolution. Oh, by the way, it gets hot fast. I didn't have this problem with the amazon basics one."
5,HDMI CABLE,"The product quality is really good. How ever, would be geat if i am able to see the real picture of the product and not the look a like picture before purchase. could do better on this part."
4,Decent Cable,It is a good product. It does improve quality of picture. And for the price on here you can not beat it.
3,"Sorta ok, gives a very basic overview of things..","Luthier Ken looks like he is going to pee himself the whole time he is on camera. And his side kick does most of the talking, and at times has to almost force Ken to talk. I am telling you, the guy(Ken) has issues.The info he gives is very basic, I hate to say it, but I found the whole DVD to be quite funny. The entertainment lies in watching Ken basicly ""wig out"" the whole DVD. He needs some Xanex. It will help him."
4,Nice Text in great shape,text in almost new shape at a bargan price. Detailed positoning with pictures and graphics make it easy to understand. and I recived it fast.
5,A Thousand Shades of WOW!,"This is a book unlike any other and well worth the wait to get your hands on a copy! The blurb on the back doesn't do it justice, and the cover is cool, but it really has very little to do with the story. What matters is what's between the covers. You MUST read this book! A writer and a bodyguard grudgingly hammer a friendship out of fear, torture, pain adventure and family secrets, and I'm so glad they did!"
3,Pleasant Story -- Appalling formating,"This is an excellent story, and I enjoyed reading it the plot and about the characters, Merlin and Morrigan, but what is the deal with this publisher and their inability to format a book anywhere near properly like professional books are created? There are scene breaks in the middle of conversations and indents where they should not be and lack of indentation where it is supposed to be. If the format was corrected, this 200 page book might only be about 175 pages. The book itself has a nice cover, but pages are fragile. By half-way through the book, the pages were threatening to fall out. I wonder if their printer ever heard of glue?I would maybe have given this one 4 stars, but the pleasant story was repeatedly interrupted by the poorly structured set-up and the typos. The author shows promise but either ought to demand better editing or else get a new publisher who knows how to format a book."
5,Excelent Book !,"I just finish to read this book, and I must say that this book is really a manual to be near you allways, beacuse Mt. CarpenterWrote all he learnt in his life about the Mental Science.In very clear words He give you information about how to work with the subconscious mind. This is a very serious issue, belive or not."
5,The book that ends the seeking,I am relieved that I finally found this book. Truly it is the book that summarizes in the most succinct and clear way to working together with your subconscious mind. It fills in the holes that have prevented you from succeeding in the law of attraction and gives you concrete practical exercises for making miracles. Buy it in every form!
2,Lenghty and not original,"I did not find anything original in this book. It is very wordy, repetitive and boring to read. The author presents cases after cases and the pretended messages and methods are not straightforward. Reading the end-of-chapter exercises challenges our patience. A 30-page version of this book would be a much better work."
3,Another review about poor printing,"I think the book is wonderful -- the parts I could read. The printing as referenced by another reviewer, is impossible to read. And I mean impossible. I've tried with more light and/or a magnifying glass, and nothing works. It's black print on charcoal and sometimes black background. Not all the pages in a series of practice recitations are as dark as some, but overall it renders the entire practice sections useless to me. What were they thinking?"
5,Simplistic Genius,"Harry Carpenter is a genius in taking a very complicated idea re: the power of the subconscious mind, and developing simplistic tools, usable tools to learn to surpass the limitations and restrictions we place on ourselves. I have not read another book which was more helpful."
5,Simple and Practical,Excellent easy to use information if you want to know how to eliminate bad habits or help add a new dimension to your success by changing your mind in a real way. You will have to put in some work but it's much easier this way than trying to force a change on your own.
3,John Goodman in Australia,"Dirty Deeds did not live up to our expectations; the script and story line had possibilities, however the audio was well below par, when you consider Aussie lingo at many times needed sub-titles. With Bryan Brown, Sam Neill and John Goodman, we expected much more in enjoyment, but it didn't measure up."
2,"A poor mans version of ""Snatch""...","""Lock Stock and 2 smoking barrels"", ""Pulp Fiction"" etc. I REALLY like all of these movies but ""Dirty Deeds"" just isn't that good. It's got a great cast including Toni Collette (she is the main reason I bought this movie). But the screenplay isn't very interesting. The acting is good but not enough to save this movie."
1,Depressing,Thought this was going to be a war style movie from the cover..Guess I was hoping korean war...But this movie is depressing watching the main character go crazy and a local girl. I dont recommend this movie. Wished I could get my money back.
1,2 DISC SET,"IT SAY'S A 2 DISC SET, WHAT HAPPENED TO DISC NUMBER 2!!Product Details* Actors: Palaestra Trainer* Directors: Palaestra Training* Format: NTSC* Region: Region 1 (U.S. and Canada only.

5,Awesome gift!,"I bought this book for my mom, who loves to travel to Italy and she loved it so much. Thank you!"
4,Great Gift Idea,"I never know what to get people who have everything and are Italian American for a present. This book fit the bill perfectly. The pictures are wonderful, the text is interesting and the price can't be beat."
4,Picture Perfect,"It is my wifes dream to go to Italy, so I bought her the next best thing until I can take her there myself. She loves the book and can't wait to go see it in person!!Billy Wannyn"
1,Worst bookseller I've ever dealt with; Amazon should dump them,I purchased 101 Beautiful Small Towns in Italy from ZP Books last July.They sent me 101 Beautiful Small Towns in FRANCE.I returned the incorrect title and requested a refund.I waited a reasonable length of time before sending ZP a follow-up email.I'm still waiting for my refund.I have purchased dozens of items from Amazon and its merchants through the years and never had an experience like this.Amazon should drop ZP from it's roster of affiliated booksellers.Don't make the same mistake I did. Avoid ZP Books like the plague.
2,Very Nice book--poorly packaged by seller,"I purchased the book ""One Hundred and One Beautiful SammlTowns in Italy"" for friends of mine in Sammamish, WA. Thebook was so poorly packaged that the covers for the bookwere torn--there was no packing material. They told methey returned the book to Amazon and then shortly thereafterthey left for Europe and won't return for a couple weeks.Sincerely, John MoorePS I have one of these books and lent mine to ourfriends when I learned the one I had sent to themwas damaged."
5,101 Small Wonderful Towns!,This is a coffee table book that you'll actually read! It brings back memories of the wonderful places we've visited and well as selecting new places to go.Highly recommended for Italy lovers!
3,not as nice as expected,"The book is full of lovely information and quite nice pictures, however, the quality of the paper was not very good and the photos were dull.Over all, the book is not of the Rizzoli quality that I have in my other table top books."
1,We Need a better Annie Karaoke,"This Karaoke for the Broadway Musical Annie is a disappointment. ""Hard Knock Life"" does not follow the parameters of the original sound track and is a whole tone higher. The tempos are much slower than the original. Why can't someone just take the original and immitate it precisely to the original motion picture sound track. I tried using pitch control and had more tempo problems, but that is my problem. The big problem is that it is not in sync with the original."
2,Not much of a text,"I purchased this text as it is required for my precalc class. The review that follows this review talks about how this book is not a self teaching guide but is to supplement the classroom experience. I can't say that I agree wit that. The book is very difficult to read even after attending the classroom session on the topic. The author does a poor job of introducing topics and drawing out points. Symbols are used in a confusing manner without explanation. The author will introduce a topic, explain it in just a few sentences and follow with ""therefore"" followed by a conclusion that is not explained. The authors seem more interested in proving how smart they are and less interested in teaching. Not really a good book but the graphs are good and odd answers are in the back."
1,An awfully composed book!,"The college I went to required this book but the instructor hated it! To illustrate, on the first day of class she brought 4 precal books from years past and held this book up to them. The first thing we noticed is that this book is 1/2 the size of the older precal books. Looking through it you find that a lot of critical/remedial information has been left out! As a consequence she had to supplement from those books of yester-year or (as she put it) a lot of people would have probabaly made a D or flat out failed because the way this book was structured!I wholeheartedly agree with her!In short, this book is way, WAY too assuming in the sense that you have a very strong mathematical (algebraic) background and practically throws you off into deep water leaving you to tread it for yourself. To the authors, Mr. Faires and Mr. Defranza...you two might be great math teachers, but your textbook writing skills need some serious work!"
3,Would Never Happen,"Some back door. I think there was a deadline that needed to be met or pressure form someone, 'cause I don't see my Xani ever ending things like that. Hope to see him again- she was writing him so well until now..."
4,I am sure we can all say we are highly satisfied.,"Yep, as I finished this book a nice feeling filled me. At least we see the relationship between our two heroes developed in a father - son one. At least the master accepts his padawan. This acceptance is even better and stonger than the first time as gui gong aknowledge their differences and that the path in front of them will be a hard but enjoyable one. The only little thing that annoyed me is that it seems that out two jedis were not as efficient as usual, also sometimes in these books we wonder why Obi Wan is a padawan when it looks like he is doing everything as well as GI Gong (sorry cannot speel it. I also really appreciate the jedi lessons which seem to be good ones even for us. So I hope we will have more jedi wisdom in the next one. Finally why do we have to wait two months to get only 150 pages. Please publish the books two by two and make them much longer."
4,"Love the series, but wish this one was more thought out","Well, as usual i coudn't put this book down, i absolutly love the series. I can relate very well with Obi-wan's search for trust and acceptance. This book's plot was good, i especially liked the way it showed how we can allow the government to control us, as long as we get our money. Greed has been the downfall of many a nation. I really enjoyed the surprise ending too, though to me it seemed too easy. Can Xanatos really be gone? The only thing i didn't like was the fact that the plot seemed rushed, it wasn't as well thought out as the other books. But whatever! Sometimes I wish QUi-Gon and Obi-wan would land in my backyard, and help solve some of this planets problems. I do hope that Jude will keep writing this series for years to come, because i don't think i'll ever tire of it!"
5,"""If this isn't a good book, kill me now!""","I thought I would die of suspense. In this one Xanatos, Qui-Gon's former apprentice, (you probably knew that) shows how evil he really is. I mean EVIL. Also, Qui-Gon's feelings for Obi-Wan are shown. Even though they're not Master and Padawan, they begin acting like it again.Although I missed Tahl and TooJay, Den made up for that. Just as funny and action packed as the rest. I still say Jedi Apprentice needs one hundred+ stars!"
3,A good overview,"This is a good over view of the weapons and warfare in the post-migration period in the British Isles. The author's work on the various items is quite good but he seems to be unfamiliar with the realities of hand-to-hand combat and some of his conclusions about combat in the Saxon era seem to be erroneous. Overall this is a great book, far far better then any of the garbage from Osprey but if you are looking for an in depth look into Saxon archeology you would be better served with a more academic book."
2,Awkward!,I had worked with marcel irons before so I decided to try this one by Hot Tools. Cool color but difficult to control. Curls did not last. Tip too hot to the touch so unable to use the assistance of other hand to control curl on the iron. Handle is marcel so it swivels and constantly moving. Just too awkward to keep so I had to return it. Make sure you are almost a pro at working with marcel handles before purchasing this iron.
2,Not what i wanted..,I mistakenly ordered the wrong iron.. so i returned it and suppose to get another one.. but i don't seem to find the information for it.. can someone please contact me let me know if i'm going to be receiving the 1 1/2 inch iron.. thank you..
3,Warp Speed,"This umbrella isn't bad for a cheapie. The pole does have girth, not a problem for me because I'm not using it with a patio table. It fits perfectly in the 60+ pound stand from Costco without the gromet. When the umbrella arrived the first thing I did was teak oil the wood for protection. Three months later, several of the arms are warped and bowing. The shade isn't Sunbrella, I knew that when I purchased it. I would say it is a cross between nylon and canvas, and seems to be fading. I doubt it will make it through two seasons, but for the money it serves the purpose. My local grocery store is selling a similiar umbrella for $59.00, overall not that great of a deal."
2,read the fine print,"The product description clearly states that the pole is 1 7/8 inches around, but I didn't notice it, and I don't think you would either. Problem is this a larger than normal size (guessing 1 1/2) and it won't fit the hole in my brand new table or my brand new base. I noticed it as soon as I took it out of the box, the pole is huge! It looks good, but it will likely not fit your furniture. I've never seen an umbrella with this size pole before.Also the description states the top is canvas, but it seemed like a much lighter poly material to me. Made in China."
2,"Astonica Market Umbrella, Hunter Green (10 ft Diameter)","The description of this umbrella states that the diameter of the two piece juniper pole is 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Actually it is 1 7/8 inches in diameter. Since most standard tables have pole openings less than 1 7/8"", this umbrella cannot be used with a table, rendering it useless for my purposes. Furthermore, the juniper pole came split.Unless you want to stick this umbrella in the sand or have a holder or table with a 2"" diameter opening, I would avoid this item."
2,"Nice, but...","Waited all this time for this great deal. It finally got here and the top of the umbrella where the canvas attaches to the poles was craked in three different place. It was also cracked at the middle junction. It's a pretty one, BUT!Now I have to figure out how to retun it."
2,"Astonica Market Umbrella, Hunter Green",When removing this umbrella from the box a piece of wood dropped to the floor. Obviously a broken piece of wood. It turned out to be one of the umbrella supports. What's upsetting to me is that whoever packaged this umbrella had to have known that this was broken. The piece was completely broken into two pieces. I hate going through the trouble of returning items and having to deal with extra postage etc. So I've decided to repair the borken piece myself. I think that there should be some kind of steps taken to assure that items are not shipped already broken. There was no damaged to the box so the wood had to have been broken BEFORE being packaged.
1,Umbrella I bought,"The umbrella i bought looks good not broken, intact, but the roundness is way to big for a standard umbrella stand, how the heck am I going to get it to fit? The is obviously not normal size on these umbrellas? I really like the umbrella, I don't know what I am going to do with a stand I cant use for this? Who has stands big enough for this embrella?"
1,Decided Not to Buy the Umbrella,"I was ready to push the ""buy"" button, until I read the reviews. Having read the reviews I am declining to purchase the umbrella. The biggest issue is the diameter of the table opening and the base, which in my case is 1 1/2 inches.Unfortunately several of the reviews state that the pole turned out to be larger than 1 1/2 inches, more like 1 and 3/4 inches instead of 1 1/2 inches as stated in the description.This would render the unbrella completely useless, at least in my case. I was specifically looking for an unbrella pole of 1 1/2 inch diameter. I thought I had such a pole until I read the reviews. I am disappointed because I liked every other feature of the umbrella."
4,Umbrella,"Hello,The picture showed the umbrella with the stand. I was a little surprised to see it arrive and it be the umbrella only. Otherwise, the umbrella is pretty."
4,Works well,It went right through anything I used it on. It even made nice long strands of zucchine that I used as a pasta substitute. The handle is think so it's very easy to grip well. I'm glad I bought it.
3,Cheap little Zester but it will get the job done,Not exactly the sturdiest tool to work with. Does what it's supposed to though. Blade is sharp and creates nice shavings too.
1,A Thorough Disappointment,"I was excited and eager to see a book on Evangelion published in the English language. Upon reading this book, I'm inclined to disavow the existance of this book entirely. The book seems to have been rushed, poorly proofed, and written for no other reason than to have a product about Evangelion for sale. It would appear that the authors made an effort to do some original research, but it falls flat on its face, as it is riddled with mistakes, speculation, mistakes, and misconceptions that had long been disspelled in the fan community. This book will only serve to spread more misconception to fans of the show in their search of answers and commentary. I can't recommend this to anybody but the extremely hardcore Evangelion fans for the purpose of snickering and belittlement. If you're looking for something Eva related to read, I would suggest picking up The Notenki Memoirs instead.Originally published on:EvaMonkey.com"
5,Magnificent book. Beats all others hands down.,"There is a huge glut of ASP.NET books out there, but none with a Visual Studio.Net focus. . . . unless you count the convoluted study/certification guide from MS Press.In 3 hours I had done more with Visual Studio.Net than I had in any other book-to-date. I think the first reviewer's comments said it best.This book rules! I would recommend this book to ANYONE needing to get into the nitty gritty of ASP.NET with VS.NET."
2,Disappointing,"I got this book because it received many good reviews. I was extremely disappointed when I read it. This book felt like a copy-and-paste reference. It goes through code without really explaining why you're programming it that way. Another weakness of this book is that, instead of sticking to code you've learned about, it has you program complex code that they never teach you about in this book. The real-world examples and instruction are also seriously lacking.Overall, I would urge you not to get this book, beginner or not. I went through the entire thing and still feel like I didn't learn anything."
4,was a little smaller than expected,"Its not too bad, just cuts me under the arms a little bit. Maybe get the size up? Otherwise support is good and great quality product."
3,Does not flatten but it's itchy!,"It does not flatten but the material, on the inside, makes me itch and it's uncomfortable. I wanted to be able to wear this for bed but that's impossible. Just to the gym and that's it."
4,Good sports bra,"Provides decent support for jogging, though not the best. I'm not sure if it would be good for longer, more-intensive runs though. Fits true to size."
3,Very tight fit,"I wear a 34 A in a regular bra and had to purchase a 34B in this product. As an equestrian and tennis player, I needed a reasonably priced, high impact, sports bra. This item fits that requirement, but it's difficult to put on and has weird bumps that don't smooth out in the cup area. Those bumps show with tighter fitting apparel. That being said, for the price and functionality, they're OK."
1,colored bras run all over clothes,I bought a pink and black bra and they always run all over my golf clothes after I sweat. I have ruined many outfits this way. I have washed them but they still run.
5,Good bra,"Good support.I have a D-sized breasts, and, without proper support, exercising is a problem , especially running.I hate it when my breasts ""jump"". This bra provides good support but does not squeeze them.Also, I do sweat a lot, and this bra does not keep you wet under it.Overall, good support and comfortable wear."
3,"Decent bra, a bit tight","I purchased this bra in 34B. My normal bra size is 34B/C. My experience was similar to many other reviewers--the bra was quite tight! I would advise ordering a size up. I found it a bit restricting and felt that it ""compressed"" me (opposite to its claims), but it's wearable."
5,Favorite Sports Bra,"I love these sports bras. I like that the cups are lined. They are very supportive and comfortable. I'm not large chested to begin with so I like that I actually have some shape while wearing this bra, and my chest isn't smashed down. I definitely want to buy a few more."
2,way too tight to get on and off,this construction is so tight in the band that I could not get it on and was afraid if I got it on I woudl never get it off. I returned it.
2,Rotten Return Policy,This bra had to be returned because it was much smaller than similar products with the same sizing information in the stores. That was too bad. What was worse is that only half the cost of the product was credited. Why? There was a huge restocking fee. Be careful! You can't get your money back from this seller when the product is misleadingly described.
4,WELL CONSTRUCTED But too snug,The bra was very well constructed but was a bit snug for the size ordered with very little give.Even though the bra says shape it did not do much more than a standard sport bra.Still a quality item possibly better in a slighty larger size.
4,Good low impact bra,I originally bought this bra to wear it while running and it turns out it is better for hiking and other low impact activities.Also I usually wear a 34C and this one is almost too tight.Otherwise it is well made and comfortable.
5,Excellent,"This is the best sports bra I own. I want one of every color. The support is amazing. Unlike other sports bras, it allows you to wear thin clothing and not have to worry about flashing people. It's comfortable, VERY durable, and very appealing. You can't lose with this bra!"
3,Not for larger chested girls.,"I'm a 36dd, and ordered the 38d. I would say this is good for very light exercise. I was just walking on the treadmill today and there was a lot of bounce. But for under a t shirt in the summer it would be good. The seem lines that people are talking about are just seems, but I can see where some people wouldn't like them. But at the gym it's not a big deal. I'm probably going to try to,avoid wearing this bra to the gym again however because the stitching under the boobs gets really itchy and uncomfortable when you sweat. So, bottom line, for larger chested girls this doesn't provide any more support than a regular bra, but its more comfortable for everyday. Not good for gym."
4,not for high impact,"This bra looked flattering for my body type 5'8"" 30C but it didn't work for high impact. I purchased 3 other model and brands and this had the least coverage so the girls could move more than I desired. It is comfortable: the arm pit opening is wide and allows plenty of motion, and the bottom band stayed in place all the time. I preferred the Champion 360 Performance with back closure, which is extremely helpful to remove the bra after sports (when sweaty)."
1,False advertisement,"I ordered this because the description says natural shape with ""high support."" However, I just received my product and it says ""medium support."" I wanted to use this bra for running and need a high support sports bra. I haven't tried it on yet, and am not sure whether to just deal with it or return it."
2,Not great for busty women,"I've ordered two of these, based on the great reviews and regret it. I've ordered a 36D, which is my bra size and works for other sports bras, but this one is way too small. There is no way this is made for a d cup, let alone a 36D. I had to really squeeze my way into this bra and it felt tight and highly uncomfortable, flattening my chest.I have also ordered two ""Moving Comfort Women's Fiona Bra"" and can highly recommend those. They fit perfectly and have become my favorite bras."
5,Best sports bra. Period.,"A majority of the complaints with this sports bra is that it shows through your shirt. If that's the only trade-off, that's fine by me. I don't really mind people knowing I'm wearing a bra, so that doesn't affect me in the least. I bought this bra because a friend said it gave great support and after trying it out, I couldn't agree more!I run 2-3 miles every day and must say, I've never felt this kind of support with any other sports bra (including Nike, Reebok and Adidas). It feels as though your breasts are in an anti-gravity chamber, I kid you not. And with my 38C size, that's no small feat!I'm ordering more, more, more! Love these! Thanks, Champion!"
1,Not for larger breasts. This is a pull-over bra.,"I usually swear by Champion products - and still do about most - but this bra was a flop for my ladies. I'm a 36D and needed a T-back sports bra. I ordered this because my favorite sports bra for the past decade has been a Champion jogbra. Wow did this disappoint. I should've known when it was clear this was a pull-over bra that really can't be adjusted. I like my ladies on lock down when I work out, and this pull-over bra ain't gonna cut it. Returned it."
3,Decent Bra but not worth its own hype,"I bought this sports bra because I was searching for something that was simultaneously good on control for the well-endowed and because they claimed it is ""no show"". Well it is decent on control - although no better than anything else, but it is not ""no show"" as claimed. The ribbing also makes it a little difficult to put on. So overall, decent but not outstanding."
4,Could be a little bigger,"I like the side pockets, but I think it could be a little bigger overall. I have trouble fitting a mat and towel in and oftentimes have to re-roll my mat."
3,not the most comfortable,"This is a good bra for the most part, it does what it is supposed to do. However there are seams along the inside on the sides that chafe and make it somewhat uncomfortable to wear. This bra is not constructed of the same material as the one I bought almost a decade ago of the same design (which I loved)."
4,"Comfortable, Functional, Flattering","First things first: I'm a 34A, ordered the small, and use this bra primarily for running on a treadmill and doing zumba. I was searching for the most movement restricting bra out there. This is not that bra, but it's pretty good.The bra is very comfortable, and it's flattering. I believe it's designed so it avoids the chest smushing or uni-boobing that is usually characteristic of sports bras.As for bounce-resistance, movement is effectively limited so that discomfort is essentially eliminated. I think that an x-small might have been better for my purposes, and would probably size down if I were to reorder. There's no chafing, pinching, or anything of that sort caused by the bra.I'm still in search for the perfect sports bra, but if it turns out such a bra doesn't actually exist, this one would do."
5,Excellent Buy,"This is a great shirt on or off sports bra that is stylish, still very supportive, but not flattening. I am loving this bra. It is also very true to size. The price was right. This was an excellent buy!UPDATE: MY FAVORITE BRA EVER HANDS DOWN!!! I just bought another one and bought one for my track star sister over the holidays. This is super sexy, super fun, super functional."
4,supportive and comfortable,"Supportive, but flexible enough so that it is easy to put on. Fits true to size. Comfortable. Good color choices. I would buy it again."
4,"Comfortable bottom band, insufficient cup padding","Normally sports bras with thick bottom bands end up restricting my rib cage. This one is pretty comfortable! I was hoping the cups would be padded enough to conceal everything in a cold gym, but they aren't."
3,Nice support but a bit stiff,This sports bra is very supportive but is a bit stiff. The fabric is much thicker than I care for and the piping around the neck and arms is a bit cumbersome. Overall I will stick to a less constructed garment next time. I purchased this for running.
4,good for low and medium impact activities,"this bra is very similar to the Champion Shape Scoop Sports Bra, but offers a little more support since it has a racer back. otherwise, these two bras are very similar. I love the look and feel of this bra. it is not a classic compression bra, but encapsulation--it has separate cups. in addition, it is not made of all cotton, but a special moisture wicking material, very comfortable. I have purchased this bra three times, and it was perfect when i was a 34B--provided plenty of support and i loved how it was thick enough that i never showed through my tank top when exercising, but now that i am a 34D, i don't think this bra provides enough support when i am doing high impact activities like running or kickboxing. for low to medium activities this sports is perfect still. but since i have taken up more rigorous activities, i have bought the panache bra (make sure to buy your EXACT size in panache)."
2,I'm picky and this didn't cut it.,"I'm a 34 B and that's what I ordered.Pouring out the top of this bra.The band around the chest felt flimsy to me.The seams (usually I don't care about that)but the seams SCREAM > HEY LOOK AT MY BOOBSthrough any t-shirt... if that's what youwant. Supportive, but the straps are too long onme - (I usually have the opposite problem).Best part is the padding / just enough forno see through - but the seams totally wreckany benefit from that. Nice colors.Good quality. I'm picky. Nasty seams. You'lltell yourself you don't care about the seams,over and over - but you will anyway. I thoughtI wouldn't just like you. Not a running bra.This is a ""I look nice in my bra,"" bra.And you will... but that's about it."
4,All time favorite sports bra,"This is my all time favorite sports bra. I own several of them and absolutely love them because the material holds sweat away from my body better than other sports bras, it has AWESOME support (36C) and I LOVE not sporting a ""uni-boob"" unlike traditional sports bras. The bra stays in place, and is extremely comfortable. It provides a wonderful amount of coverage but not too much. This is the sexiest ""support"" sports bra that I have ever owned and I'll definitely buy more. Some users may not be crazy about the seams in the front of the bra, but I don't mind them at all--shirt on or shirt off. They lay flat and do not hinder comfort in the least. Don't debate too much on whether or not to get this bra. If you want an awesome sports bra that looks good and provides great support and is really comfortable, buy several.Have a great workout.~Chandra"
3,Nice shape but not breathable,"I was looking for a bra that would give me support with out flattening--this totally does that. It's completely comfortable for pilates and other lower impact workouts but any cardio work outs when you might sweat a lot, it gets kind of uncomfortable. It doesn't wick sweat & there are no vents. I love the shape & style, I just wish they made this exact same style with a mesh back."
3,Straps are short,"I am a size 4 (125 lbs) and 34B and I purchased size 34B in this bra. The colours were great but the fit was somewhat small and the straps were particularly short and dug into the shoulders. I also am unsure if the bra is suitable for running as there are no vents on the bra and at the end of my run the bra is 'soaked' and leaves an uncomfortable feeling. There are also lumps as one reviewer pointed out, along the front seams that do not smooth out under clothing (but this is a minor issue for me). I love the colours but I would hesitate before purchasing another one."
5,Great running bra,This is a fantastic bra because it offers both support and nice shaping without any underwires or discomfort. It's my new favorite marathon race bra!
2,"nice shape, pretty but not very functional","It's nice shape and flattering. However, it retains sweat alot which makes it feel very uncomfortable after only a few minutes of working out for someone who sweat alot like me won't appreciate so much. I ended up buying three of these though.. 1st one wrong size, one pink/white, and one white/charcoal. no return policy due to sanitary reason, so choose the right size, you can't return it even if you get the wrong size."
4,Great,Love this bra. Fits perfectly. Holds me up! Highly recommend. I have 6 of them in different colors.
4,"Good bra, good deal","These are excellent medium support bras. I have them in 34C and use them for any physical activity that requires running, jumping, and/or sweating. They have some shape which avoids the tube-top effect, but could be better. Before I lost a large amount of weight and was larger-busted (DD), these bras were great at minimizing under my button-down uniform shirt. They are high-quality and long-lasting (5+ years and still going). My reason for buying these from Amazon: 50% cheaper than in my local store!"
2,They Don't Do the Job,"I am disappointed with these scissors. They don't take care of the little hairs. I've gone back to a good little pair of scissors with sharply pointed ends. I sometimes poke myself, but I cut the hairs I want to cut."
3,See Comments,"First, let me state that I have arbitrarily rated this item with 3 stars because I was forced to make a star rating in order to complete the review. My personal opinion is somewhat mixed possibly because of an unavoidable bias. I purchased this item to replace one I had lost after about 25 years. The two differ somewhat. The Rubis does seem to be made of thicker and possibly higher quality steel, but it seems to be stubbier and shorter. My use has been limited to date, but it doesn't seem to be quite as easy to use as my former one. However, it is serviceable. The one thing I really miss is the old soft plastic case, which was essentially just large enough to hold the scissors and let it easily slide into my ""dop bag"" or a crevice anywhere in my suitcase. The large hard plastic container is excessive and inconvenient."
5,Simply the best,"These scissors are very high quality, and I don't forsee ever needing to buy another pair. They are worth every penny. They are easy to use, and the package they come in serves as a holding case, to keep them away from crowding in with other implements."
3,As described,"Arrived in a timely manner and in good shape. I've watched these movies online several times so decided to by. DVD is double sided (one movie on each side). There is a label on the top of the DVD telling you which movie is on side A and side B, but there is no indication of which side is side A or B. I just guessed that the side with the writing was side A, but don't be fooled the movies are reversed. No biggie though... I already knew about this from another individual's post. Don't affect the playing of the movie at all."
5,lots of elmo,"My daughter is 17 months old. She loves elmo! This is one of her favorites. Elmo and the count are great together. It has good jokes ( that she doesn't get yet, but laughs anyway!). It was a great purchase for Halloween. While the adults and older kids carved pumpkins and drank cider, she and her little friends watched this video. I would recommend it. Be aware that it is only slightly ""spooky"". The count sings about bones and bats. there is an organ that plays by itself, and a knight in armor that talks, as well as a picture of the ""Groan-a Lisa"" Very Cute!"
3,Monster Hits is great but Elmo says boo scared my 2 year old,Monster Hits rocks. Elmo Says Boo scared my 2 year old son and he asked to stop the video.
3,"It's ok, but not my style.","Although the group doesn't fail to mention Jesus as their saviour, the music didn't keep me tuned in for the whole trip. I was expecting to hear a dance/trance album, and what I got was more along the lines of a grudge rock/dance album. Perhaps if some lyrics were removed and some instrumental tracks were subsitituted onto this album I may have been able to enjoy the music more. Not that it doesn't take anything away from the lyrical content this album provides; but for now, it's not my thing.Check out my other reviews for great Christian CDs, books, etc!"
3,We've all seen the trailer,"So, .... what's there to say about bad Denzel. It's a different role for him and he played it well."
3,Fits a lil big,It fits a little big and it really didn't look as cute on me as i wanted it to. oh well that's what i get for buying a hat online
4,mis compras,"Buenos dias, el dia de hoy me tome la molestia para calificar esta compra, la cual nos parecio bien. quedamos conforme con la compra, gracias."
1,Limited in size,"I bought this for my son for Christmas. Several area are pre-stressed to the point of being damaged (ripped fabric). This isn't in the description. The hat is non stretching, and has no size adjustment. Either you fit perfectly or it's of no use. My nephew bought the dark grey one for my son, and it had no rips, and it stretches."
5,Wonderful book!,"After reading the Blossom Street Books, I had to buy one of the knitting books. I ended up buying two! This book looks wonderful and the pictures are beautiful! I used to knit, but have not in years and years. I am going to begin again, with lessons, and also take my granddaughter with me! Thanks for the wonderful book!!"
4,"I don't like it here in France, everyone's so snobby!","This CD is a reissue of an old album that featured bits from The National Lampoon Radio Hour. Almost all of the routines here are included on The National Lampoon Radio Hourbox set. I would recommend getting the box set instead of this CD, but if you don't feel like springing for that, this is good, too."
5,Thats not funny its sick,"Where is it. The classic. How about the olympic ice skating?? EggaMuffin. Give it to us, Please."
3,"That's not funny, that's sick....","I concur with those who say this stuff is good but does not rise to the level of ""That's not funny, that's sick"". When are they going to make this golden oldie available? I've searched everywhere and can not find it."
1,ripoff,"If you search the web you will find the fact that whenever a fair test is conducted with these expensive spekaer cables, no noe is able to detect a quality difference between them and simple lamp cord available cheap by the foot at your hardware store."
4,Worthy introduction to the writings of John Brunner,"This short story collection by John Brunner features 10 tales all originally publish in various science-fiction magazines during the 1960's.According to the ISFDB- Internet Speculative Fiction Data Base - the 1973 Dell paperback is the only edition published. The themes of overpopulation and ecological disaster are featured in some of these stories. Years later Brunner would use these themes in several novels to great critical success: ""Stand on Zanzibar"" and ""The Sheep Look Up"" for example.It is very unfortunate that this excellent introduction to the speculative fiction of John Brunner has never been reprinted. There is an introduction by the author concerning his apprehension for the future written in a humorous vein."
5,This Macally 250OTG Rocks!,"I just got it today and was a little nervous because I only saw a few reviews and they did not address a few important questions I had.1) No external power needed, the USB can supply enough power to charge the battery as well as power the drive. However it is faster to charge the internal LION battery with the charger.2) It would seem you can partition the drive with a small FAT32 and a larger NTFS and it still works. I tested this out with my Treo SD card and it copied the whole thing really fast.Is small comes with a little vinyl case (should have a little strap to secure the case but no biggy. Really well made, feels solid. For not much more than a generic USB you get USB to go.There is no downside that I can see."
3,"Works, but not with all devices","I bought this with the intent to use it with my Nikon D70, so when on vacation I don't have to take the laptop with me to transfer the pictures form the CF card.However, the transfer failed when I put the CF card in a card reader and connected with this enclosure. The reader is a Lexar USB 2.0 6in1 reader, fairly popular, so it didn't make much sense that it would be not supported.The transfer did work when I connected directly to the camera, which wouldn't be my prefered way as it would drain the battery from the camera.Maybe i will try with another reader."
2,A Major Disappointment,"A boring, slapdash approach to what appears to be a much ado about nothing ""mystery."" Colin Wilson handled the subject much more briefly, effectively (and deceptively) in his ""The Encyclopedia of Unsolved Mysteries."" It's worth noting that the Wilson chapter is based on the Gray book!"
2,Blah,The dares in this book are pretty boring and unimaginative. The spinner falls off and doesn't spin well either. It's more fun to just play truth or dare on your own without this book.
2,Mixed...,"What most people find interesting, the history of robotics and artificial intelligence, I found boring. What I found interesting was when he started talking about Roomba and other robots that exist right now, like the lawn mower! When he is explaining the pros and cons of modern robots, what they can do and can't do, how people treat and react to them, that was the bread and butter of the book. At least for me. But I agree with many of the reviews, many people may end up skipping about or skimming to get past the parts they don't like.I got it as a low, low price at Air & Space in DC, so I am not too upset, but I would be pissed if I had paid full price. I suggest getting is used or check it out of the library."
2,"good stories, shallow arguments","The book is full of interesting tales of the robotics revolution and Brooks raises all the good questions concerning the future of robots and their integration into our lives and persons. Unfortunately, Brooks also offers ""arguments"" about everything from the (in)significance of consciousness to the nature of humanity. The arguments aren't worthy of a bright undergraduate philosophy major, much less a distinguished scientist, and in fact his positions could have been supported with references of many other authors whose arguments are less facile. With a bit more effort this could have been a very good book."
3,a gentle chat,"Its a decent book about Robots and AI written in a friendly and honest manner. The first 2 sections of the book are interesting but the third section dealing with the future seems very uncertain.Rodney Brooks seems to have lost his faith in Robots slightly and instead of getting Ray Kurzweils' ranting hyper future we get crappy robot lawnmowers and robots that can open the fridge and maybe get you a beer if you install a speciak fridge. Hmmmm runs out of steam a bit.Still though he has been at it for 20 years and anybody thats been at anything for 20 years is worth having a listen to. And thats what its like, a gentle chat!"
3,Disappointing,"While parts of this book are interesting (the early discussions of individual robotics projects are interesting) the latter half devolves into what are largely stream of consciousness-type musings that veer between the quasi-interesting and somewhat muddled. This is a book that is not likely to satisfy those who are already savvy in the area, and intelligent lay people may feel (like I did) that they plopped down good money for a relatively undisciplined piece of work."
2,Well runs dry,"Most bands are not expected to grow leaps and bounds between albums, but mild Brit rockers Travis seem to completely ignore the concept and if anything, have slipped backwards. It is none more apparent then on this ultra-derivative outing, recreating essentially weaker versions of songs they covered better elsewhere in the past. Colder feels like the only song that matters here."
5,You must see them live,"I did not truly appreciate this album until about a week ago when I had the chance to see them live. I have always loved Travis, but this is now by far my favorite of their albums. They do not let their fans down, so if you get a chance to see them in concert, go! The highlights on this cd are My Eyes, Eyes Wide Open, Battleships, Big Chair, Closer, and Selfish Jean... ok, I know I just named half the cd, but that just shows how strong this cd is."
2,Disappointing,"Too much of Franny being the minstrel and not enough of the band doing what they do best. After waiting a long time for the follow-up to 12 Memories, The Boy with No Name is a monumental disappointment."
4,mixed response,"I love Travis. The Boy with No Name is getting a mixed response from me. I'm absolutely in love with the first half of the album but really, feel luke warm about the last few songs...there's definately some filler. Still, enjoyed the album overall and would recommend buying it."
5,I love this cd!,"I've been a Travis fan since the release of The Man Who and this cd does not fail to impress with their keen ability to craft and write memorable tunes. It is the current fav and most requested cd to be played in the car by my 3 children, ages 6-13. Rolling Stone's biased 2 1/2 star review is so wrong!"
2,Two good songs at best. All else boring...emotionless.,"There is no ""Sing"" or ""Writing To Reach You"" on this CD. 12-MEMORIES is a better CD as a whole with much better individual songs as well. Same goes for THE MAN WHO & THE INVISIBLE BAND obviously. ""Selfish Jean"" is the best (most upbeat) song followed by ""Battleships"" or whatever else. Really doesn't matter since the rest of the palatable songs in the beginning of the CD, while technically good, simply have no emotion and cannot be separated from elevator music. I'm a Travis fan, but don't consider myself a huge fan. Have seen them in concert and purchased all thier albums and dumped the 1st one. This I rate as the 1st or 2nd worst CD to date."
2,Product Sub-par,The comforter and sheets are pretty however they are extremely scratchy and uncomfortable. For something advertised as 250 tc it feels more like 100.
4,Dan River Bed in a Bag,"I have been pricing comforter sets for quite a while and this is a great deal. The fact that you get a dust ruffle and pillow shams along with a great comforter makes it a keeper for me. I haven't washed the sheets yet, I'm sure they will soften up but frankly I prefer sateen so I won't use the sheets anyway. I think it is important to note that the color is more green than blue as the picture indicates."
1,"Cute, but not soft","My daughter's favorite color is blue, and she loves this bed set, BUT they are not very soft even after a washing with tons of fabric softner. She doesn't mind it, but I wouldn't sleep well because it's very scratchy."
1,BUYER BEWARE!! BUGS BUGS BUGS!!,"I bought this litter and loved it, I could flush it, it had almost no dust, THEN . . . one day I opened a new bag, and 2 days later I went to clean my litter box, and there were millions (probably not exaggerating) of wheat weevils in the ""cat bathroom"". It was COVERED in these tiny creepy crawlies. They are so small, you can barely see them, until there are millions, then you can't miss them. And their rate of reproduction is crazy!! I loved this litter for about a year, then I got a contaminated bag and BANG!!! I immediately threw out all of the old and new (unopened) litter. I guess I will be going back to the reliable(but not flushable) clay litter. :-("
4,bay leaves stop the bugs,"I've been using Swheat Scoop for years - switched from World's Best(which, alas, had too much dust for me. Swheat Scoop is fine with the cats and doesn't get tracked around as much as some other brands.There is a problem with food moth and other bug infestations in our now hotter summers. Cure: crumple up a few bay leaves in the open litter tray and pop a few in the bag of unused litter. This also works to protect your herbs, dried beans, grains, etc."
4,Good litter but not good for clumping urine,"I just switched to this brand about 2 weeks ago.Pros: Light smell, really does smell like wheat. Inexpensive and can be found at Target, etc. Two cats adapted to the new litter within hours. Healthy for cats.Cons: I've found that it does not clump well for pee! Urine often is clumped to the bottom and sides of the box."
1,The Worst EVER!,"Okay, my cat of 15 years just died, have one remaining cat that i want to do the best for decided to go with this product as opposed to clay which may have been part of the reason for my other cat's health problems.This product not only does NOT CLUMP, after one pee in the new litter,the entire litter smells of urine! Now if you have cats you know that they are clean animals , and more than not, will NOT USE THE BOX if it smells and isn't clean.Really wish i had saved the boxes, [..] Also, threw out the other litter!!!! This is a mess, i guess i have to go back to clay until something good comes out!!!!!AWFUL PRODUCT will def be calling company in the morning!"
2,Great litter but prepare for bugs,"Started using this litter regularly about 6 months ago. Love that it's natural and keeps the litter area smelling fresh. However our apartment has been infiltrated with little bugs, and they are definitely attracted to the wheat litter. Now they are in the kitchen too. The exterminator has to come and I'm just hoping we won't be dealing with this for months down the road. I'm switching back to bug-free litter."
2,"Great Idea, but full of bugs","I love the idea but this litter spawns beetles that have taken over the house. After starting using saw little beetles flying around the house. Looked in the bag and it was just swarming with these little beetles. Had never seen them before this litter, they must be eating the wheat and eggs laid in it before it arrived at our house. Gross! Avoid this!"
4,Worth every second spent reading...,"This book isn't what I was after. It's not a ""Dummies Guide"" to sharpening planes by any stretch of the imagination. However, spend just a little while reading through the book and you will develop a better understanding of the types of planes that are available to do the job you need. Not only that, but it will show you how to set your plane up properly to do the job you want and show you the best way of sharpening the blade. The photos throughout the book are of high quality, both colour and B&W, making this a book that is both useful and beautiful. I have a better understanding and appreciation for this tool as a result of reading this book and am happier and more confident using handplanes."
2,"Beautiful, but ...","it's not much of a how to book. For example, my smoothing plane was giving me trouble so I went to this book to troubleshoot the problem. The book was useless."
2,One Big Yawn,"If you have other Rozsa soundtracks from the 50's in your collection, you needn't bother with this one. It sounds like a lot of his other scores from that era, sort of self-plagiarism. I suspect Mr Rozsa wasn't particularly thrilled with this assigment, a very weak and dreary film from MGM's Dore Shary days. Though the mono recording is quite good and clear as a bell, this particular score is repetitive and monotonous. It's nothing like ""Lost Weekend"", ""Lust For Life"" or ""El Cid."" Only for Rozsa die hard fans."
1,Unreliable,I tried this remote but it was highly unreliable. I spent more time TRYING to get it to work than taking pictures with it. I finally broke down and bought the Nikon remote which works EVERY time. You get what you pay for.
5,Worth the money!,"I searched for a cable release and found many that were more expensive than this one and based upon other reviews I purchased this device. I use it with a Nikon D300 and so far it works great. I have had no performance issues and it does exactly what it is designed for. I mainly use it for macro and ebay photography. The plastic housing feels thin but I have no plans to use it to wedge open a door or as a nunchuck. The only thing I would ask for to improve it is a longer cable. Unless you need additional features not found on this device, save your money and get this one. Shipping was pretty quick, I received it in a few days."
4,Handy for time exposures,"Quite a bit less expensive than the Nikon version, this is a somewhat cheaply made, but adequate device for taking time exposures. I'm using it for 40 minute night-time photos with a D200."
2,Not recommended - very poorly designed,"I bought and tried this on my Nikon D700 and D200, then sent it back and bought the Nikon part (MC-30) that costs more than 3 times as much. Issues: The cheap cord's screw-in collar would not screw into my D700 no matter how hard I tried, although it did screw into the D200. The Nikon cord screwed easily in. The cheap cord is tightly coiled, which means it won't extend to anything close to its advertised length; the Nikon cord is straight. Finally, the cheap cord has a very flimsy switch with an uncertain initial position; the Nikon has a solid switch that with a solid feel.Electrically, the cheap cord seemed to work OK. No idea if it would hold up with use.So, I strongly recommend spending the money for the Nikon MC-30."
4,Great product for the price...,"I have been using this remote for about two months now and have had no problems. It works well and was a great price. It is a bit light in construction, but with care (I only use it in a studio setting) it will probably last for quite a while. I'm not sure how it would do being thrown into a bag a beat around a bit."
4,"Good release, for a short cord.","Order this item if you want a simple wired release button. Note that the cord is tightly coiled, and is not useful anywhere near the stated 36 inch length.The picture is accurate. Working distance is perhaps 8 to 12 inches at most. If you want a longer cord order the item with a straight cord, or go wireless instead.This item is good if you don't want to deal with a tangled cord, and don't need to release camera from any distance. Build quality seems fine to me, and it works as advertised.I would give 5 stars except the 36"" description is somewhat misleading. You would have to stretch the cord out straight to reach that length."
2,Broke after a few months,"It was great while it lasted. On third or fourth outing, I placed my D700 with remote still attached and screwed in on center console of my truck. Came back a few minutes later to find the plastic cap around pins had cracked and fallen apart. D700 is ok, as far as I can see. It might be my fault but I am going with MC30 for the replacement."
2,Stopped working way too quickly.,"I bought this shutter release last year but never used it. Then I bought a 10 stop neutral density filter before taking two trips this summer and this product did exactly what it's supposed to do. I couldn't have been happier. That's why I gave it two stars. I took it out today to do some long exposures of a spectacular sunset and got one shot with it before it completely crapped-out. Unacceptable. I got home and took it apart so see if it was because of a battery by any chance. No dice. Cheaply made device, not made to last. You get what you pay for. It has always felt a little flimsy and cheap, but I was hoping it was a diamond in the rough. If you have one that lasts I consider it a good buy, but there was no reason for this device to fail the way it did."
2,Off Brand Nikon Remote,"This product looks nice, but does not perform well. It does not lock well into the port, therefore, it constantly needs to be reinserted. I ACTUALLY LOST IT A COUPLE TIMES AND HAD TO SPEND TIME LOOKING ON THE GROUND FOR IT. I would not recommend it to a friend."
4,works fine,"this remote shutter works great except that i can't get the locking collar to lock on the camera. however, the plug is a tight fit and stays on without the collar locked."
3,All Coiled Up,"A simple, cheap, shutter release that works.That coil in the wire can be a real problem if you're trying to have a very stable platform where absolutely no movement is required. The cable transfers movement easily into the camera, so holding the remote while doing some macro shots made quite a few blurry photographs. I did assume correctly before I bought the product that the ""36"" inch length of the wire to be within the coil. That isn't necessarily a problem for me, but I thought I'd just say for those thinking that you're getting a three foot cable you're wrong, unless maybe you stretch out the cable as far as you can. Good luck getting it to stay like that."
4,Works as advertised,"Works very well with my d200 so far, better than spending over $100 on some model. It does the job. Thanks."
2,Pretty useless,"I should have known this from the picture - but this item is not designed well. You want to use a cable release to minimize camera vibration on long exposure. The coiled cable transmits vibrations back to the camera very easily. The cord is too short to set down on the ground or on a stable surface. You can't let it hang, because it will bounce all over the place and transmit the vibrations back to the camera, like a pendulum. If you're doing a bulb exposure for any considerable length of time (1 min or more), you'll find holding the release for the whole time very impractical. Don't buy this - get the longer cable product.Build quality feels flimsy and a few times I had to press the release button twice for it to trigger."
3,Works just fine.,"This is the second remote shutter of this brand that I purchased. The first worked fine but didn't last very long. Don't know why the first one quit working but when it did, I was pleased enough with the first one that I purchase another. The price was the main reason for that decision."
4,Good for the $,"I hooked this up on my D300s. For what you are paying this is a good deal. When I went to Wolf they said $150 for a clicker i laughed out loud. there has to be a better option. This is it. if you are looking to do bracketing through your remote for shooting stars or HDRs than this is not really the remote, however, this is 10% the price of one that does.+The half press to focus works great.+Fits snug on camera+feels well made+affordable-you cant step away from the camera because of the curly wire. it pulls too much tension and moves the camera. so its not a usable 36"", more like 15"" (may be a + for you if you dont want a 3' cable dangling from your camera.)"
4,Good cable remote for D300S,"This remote works really good. It is plastic, but so far has worked perfectly. Press half way for focus, and full for shutter release. It is a little touchy sometimes when focusing i.e you might click the shutter while focusing.A good product, plastic, works as described."
5,Great grandma we love you,"Grandma is writing what I say to you for us. we miss you, and I know your an angel now. But we want you back. moma says we smile like you. we miss your cookies. love Ari and Alexsandra"
5,Reunion day,"Jack is back, and so is everyone else. The series gets much more dynamic and intense. Jack breaks more rules, gets more in-your-face, and the suprises keeps on coming. This season brings up some serious issue about civil rights violation in the time of crisis, and how bad can the good guys get in order to protect innocent people, and in the end, are they still ""good"" guys?A hint to all who buy the dvd: if you've not seen season 2, DO NOT look in the bonus disc (7), or the little guide booklet, and COVER up the right side of the screen when you choose a episode, because the title screen for individual episodes often give away what will happen during that hour."
5,"""MR. PRESIDENT, MY DAUGHTER'S CAUGHT IN A BEAR TRAP!!!""","Wow, an even better season than number one. It seems that all the pieces really started to fall into place with this season as it begins running on all cylinders. Jack is back, after his wife's death, and Keifer plays him with perfection. And of course, Nina eventually is back, played even better this season. And of course, Kim Bauer is annoying and whiny and won't listen to Jack at all (and then gets caught in a bear trap - it could happen?!). I like the addition of new characters in this - Kate Warner for one does a great job although she constantly has a goofy look on her face. All in all, this season is highly enjoyable and my wife watched it in only a few days! Not as good as the 4th season, but still awesome! Do yourself a favor, though, and watch the first season before you watch the second. I hate when somebody tries to watch it out of order and then complains about it!"
3,Enough already. But I can't stop.,"More frustrating than the outlandish plot devices and cougar traps is the constant insubordinate behavior of professionals at all levels in the show. The only organizations that have any discipline are the bad ones. I'm sure, though, that in two week's I'll be all into the 3rd season. The show is compelling and fun and I can't stop popping in the next disc.The scary part it that this is how people probably look at the political decision making process. Just remember its a cartoon and have fun counting down how long it takes someone to be implicated, taken hostage, or has to play a little subterfuge. Oh, and take a shot every time you hear ""hey, it's me."""
3,"Wanted to Love it, but couldn't!","I started out liking the show very much. Watched season one and started to not enjoy it as much. Figured I'd give two a try. I have to say, so many aspects of the show were so dumb, and yet I stuck with it. started season three, got through 5 episodes and cannot do it anymore. It is so far fetched, nothing believable about it. And the characters are some of the dumbest people on any shows I've watched. Daughter Kim is so irritating! Wanted to fast forward through her scenes. I really wanted to like it, but just deleted it."
5,"Great product, great service","The product arrived quickly. Although it had been used, each disc has been flawless. We have really enjoyed this product!"
3,Unpleasant experience. Poor customer service,"I'm a firm believer in the customer is NOT always right, but it should go without saying that anyone in business should provide a reasonable amount of courtesy to his or her customers. I politely questioned this seller about the product, but instead of responding in a professional manner, I was met with sarcasm. I responded with some clarification and thought I might get an apology or a mild form of ""sorry about that,"" but I never heard from him again.I thought about whether or not I would give this seller a poor review. It was not something I set out to do, because I'm not trying to hurt anyone's business. However, he had an opportunity to apologize and he blew it, and this attitude shows a total lack of regard for his customers. For this reason I decided to share my thoughts so that others would be aware. I think I've been more than fair in response to his totally unnecessary behavior."
2,"Started out well, ending up being complete crap","I rewatched this season for the first time since seeing it when it originally aired.The first 17 episodes of this season were pretty decent, the plot about the bomb provided a lot of entertainment. Yes there were implausible things and other stuff that was stupid but for the most part it was entertaining.After those 18 episodes the plot shifts from the ""bomb"" to a government conspiracy wanting to impeach President Palmer and attack the middle eastern countries. Everything about this plot was stupid and implausible. It was so frustrating to watch I can't even put it into words.My opinion is skip this season all together. The funny thing is, they duplicate this exact plot in season 6, like literally it's the exact same thing that happens to David Palmer's brother. This season is an example of an over the top plot that goes in a bunch of different directions.Most annoying things about this season:Palmer conspiracy plotKim Bauer's plotsCarrie CTU agent"
3,"24, season two","The first CD had some gliches. It would stop and then start again. It would go in slow motion. It was aggravating, but it eventually cleared up."
2,It was pretty good but had some problems too,"There were parts of this show that seemed very unrelated. It was boring and frustrating to see Kim's stories which seemed so silly and unrealistic. It just seemed like the writers wanted her in the show so they added totally unrelated storylines. The President's staff seemed fairly stupid and the one lady who was meant to be supporting him didn't communicate well with him at all, this led to more storylines but wasn't very believable. The number of setbacks that Jack had when he almost had proof of various things was unbelievable mainly because these seemed to happen out of clumsiness and stupidity which he clearly is not.Overall there are some interesting stories here but when you look at it as a whole it it all generic. I feel like the writers have locked themselves into needing to write 24 episodes and so have run out of good ideas."
4,24 Season 2,"Product came late, but during Christmas time, was ok. Luckily it wasn't a Christmas gift! Box is in good condition for a used item."
5,Awesome Show! Awesome Series!,"I guard the 24 series with my life, I don't loan it to friends, if they want to watch they get to come over and watch it. George Mason (Xander Berkeley) plays an awesome role in this series. And Jack is as hardcore as ever!"
3,I have to put my two cents in...,"Like so many before me posted, this season doesn't quite stand up to the quality of season 1 and season 3. The primary storyline is convincing. What made this season just average (or slightly below average) is the fact that the story of Jack's daughter actually detracts from the main story. While her role was great in season one, her character should have been cut from the series after that. She does better in season 3 - but only marginally."
5,Explosive!!!,"The fun continues with season Two of ""24."" Full of unexpected surprises that keep your attention. Much easier to view than when interrupted by commercials. Jack Bauer's character and the whole CTU group make for riveting watching as they carry forward the ""24"" brand of TV action. You'll be blown away."
4,"Well done, but over the edge at times","Anthony, you shouldn't be so hard on Chris. People who talk about the ""WORST (or BEST) ever, in history, etc. are either very young or use extremes for discription. Unfortunately that is the trend in this country. I have the first set and will get this one. The reason it is 4 stars is the constant confusion at HQ, with traitors, personal relations, and temper tantrums to a degree NO organization (much less national security) could ever permit. I wonder how long the series can continue--by using ""superman"" plots it is hard to keep coming up with something the audience will accept. I'll be very surprised if it goes beyond 4 seasons--but maybe the writers can tone it down a bit (which would be good anyway)."
4,fun drama thriller,"For those who enjoy paranoid conspiracy thrillers, and cliff hangers on almost every episode, give this a try. Acting ranges from so-so to pretty good."
2,Pas vraiment necessaire,"Trop long et des histoires pas toujours passionnantes, a la fin j'ai plus l'impression d'avoir perdu 24h de ma vie."
4,Addictive,"I truly enjoyed the first season and although, this one was good as well, I'm getting tired of constantly seeing Jack on the wrong side of the law. I mean, just once, can't he work with CTU unstead of creeping around because somebody in his life is in danger again?"
3,The Problem with 24,"24 represents some of the best story telling and acting that has ever been on television. But that does not mean that it's without serious faults. The most dominant of which is the grotesque liberal writing, especially in Season 2. The most obvious problem with the writing is the utter lack of concern to writing stories that are polarizing. You will either love or hate the story agenda.What we have here are writers that are pushing a liberal notion of saving the world that one will either choose to believe or find offensive."
4,"good, but not as good as the 1st","Season 2 is a great season. I like the theme and how there's a nuc in LA. It may be more of a what's gunna happen next thing than the first season, but it still isn't as good. The part that really screws it up is the ending. It's bad! But the season is still decent, so still buy it, but not before the first season.PS- IF U LIKE THESE FIRST 2 SEASONS, DON'T WATCH SEASON 4. IT'LL MAKE U THINK 24 IS GOING DOWNHILL. HAHAHAHAHA EDGAR'S AN IDIOT AND HE'S FAT!"
5,We need heroes,"As human beings, struggling everyday, we need someone to look up to. We need an example of endurance. We need a shining beacon of devotion and commitment. We need a paradigm of virtue.Jack Bauer and David Palmer serve that purpose in the significant and extraordinary ""24"". Watching them in action in every episode is inspiring - and inspiration is the name of the game.In the phenomenal second season the developments in the series are overwhelming; if the first season changed the way we look upon the products of the small screen, the second season enhances everything and take the events and action to new heights we've never imagined.Consider the fact that every bit of information you gather on the show before seeing it will reduce the experience - so all you really have to do is to take a seat and prepare yourselves for one of the wildest rides of your lives."
3,Cougar?,"Yeah, I was a huge fan of the first season. I picked this up hoping for more of the same. I have to say, I was very disappointed until I stopped taking it seriously. The down sides of the season include ridiculous plot twists, and insane events that regularly occur. What saves the season would be the characters and the very attractive women they have cast."
4,Edge of your seat action marred by impossible situations,"I've watched almost through season 2 and I've not been able to stop watching, but the one thing that drives me insane is the mire that each character is put through to get what should be straight-forward simple tasks done. The daughter running into a series of impossible situations. Other characters thrown into situations that are a bit far-fetched. I understand it's entertainment, but by the end of this season it's agonizing to see roadblocks put in front of the characters in a repetitious fashion. It becomes so predictable that you know what's going to happen before it does. Despite this I find it hard to stop watching and want to see what happens next."
1,Whatever,"Some Americans are really taking this 'war on terrorism' malarky way too far. C'mon, it's even infiltrating your television series' now. Viewers in the rest of the world are, via series' like this, force fed this kind of paranoid android stuff every DAY. Enough. The first series was fine, the subtext in this one puts me off completely."
1,In ten seconds the bomb will explode,This show is one of the worst in TV history come on it just plain sucks I predict in the Season Premier there will be some kind of Bomb it will take place in L.A. and this clown has to save us all.I'll take my chances on someone else.Don't support crappy TV like this.The Worst show on Television bar-none.
2,"OK for the price, I suppose","I knew I was buying a cheap printer when I got this, and I got what I paid for. It's fine, but nothing special. It bleeds through ink really fast, which hurts my plan for just getting an inexpensive way to print. One annoying thing is that as it runs low on color ink, the quality goes way down, so you have to change the cartridge even before it's really out. So you go through ink even faster than you think you will.In the end, while there were no real surprises, I think the idea of buying a cheap printer to save money isn't the best plan."
1,dreadful came without cords and ink and was for a pc not a mac,"The seller did not include any cords, or ink and failed to say it was for a pc and not a mac.dreadful salesmanship I wish I could send it back."
1,Don't purchase this Kworld product,"Product installed OK and then went downhill. Poor quality video and audio. Lack of suport from KWORLD, software was marginal and lacked internal help. But a nice DVR, record your 8mm tapes and use your PC to edit the DVD instead. Save yourself the headache of using this poorly designed and very expensive connector/product."
1,Don't worry so much about the lead.....,"... as long as you don't ingest it. Lead sheet by itself doesn't cause any health problems. It's only when you eat it or breathe particles released from grinding or cutting that cause an issue. As an acoustics engineer, we use lead sheet all the time as a means of adding mass damping to ductwork to reduce flow noise. It's cheap and can be formed to complex shapes pretty well. In a car, this stuff would be most effective in adding mass to large body panels (doors, trunk floors, etc.) to reduce the amount of external road noise getting into the car. All they've done here is package it in a convienent form with adhesive backing and added a hefty markup."
5,The Isley's Burn It Up,"The Isley Brothers have gone through many different styles. From the early rock 'n' soul of songs like ""Twist & Shout"" * ""Shout"" to the Motown years of ""This Old Heart Of Mine"" to the funk of the mid 70's, they have constantly & consistently produced great and influential music. The Heat Is On was the band's only number one album and is well deserving of the ranking. From the opening sounds of the fiery ""Fight The Power"", the album moves into funk, rock and smooth soul. Hip Hop fans may not know their names, but they know the beats as the Isleys are among the most sampled bands. The Isleys always made interesting and well produced albums and The Heat Is On may top the list as their best album."
5,One of the Best Isley Brothers Albums Ever Made,"What can I say? This album exposes the Isleys' raw talent in action--'70s style. I loved the way the album was made: Jams on one side, ballads on the other. ""Fight the Power"" is a powerful, yet gritty classic that's worthy of a listen--especially for new IB fans, and Ronnie Isley's breathy vocal style on the track ""Sensuality"" is magnificent and makes for a great tune to add to anyone's quiet-storm soundtrack. Bottom line: ""The Heat Is On"" shines as one of the true testaments to the Isleys' lifelong musical legacy."
3,very good,very good service 100% recommended was what I expected very reliable fast delivery good prices and excellent service thanks in advance
3,A reasonable attempt,"I purchased this book expecting a lot more , I was expecting this to be a guide on the state of the art in accelerated learning with practical examples on how to increase your learning power. However what I got was a summary of all recent research and some half-hearted attempts at practical training. Especially annoying was the frequent use of specious argument and hearsay. If you are looking for more than a relaxing read do not buy."
4,"very interesting, but...","colin rose's ""accelerated learning"" is like sheila ostrander and lynn schroeder's ""superlearning"", where it discusses the ""learning how to learn"" techniques that are heavily based on the seminal work of dr georgi lozanov's ""suggestology/suggestopedy"". however, the former book is much better in presentation of facts and it discusses beyond dr lozanov's work.it is interesting to note that the book applies what it teaches. for example, the book has a highly visual ""memory maps"" at the end of each chapter that serves as a summary.however, i'm a little bit disappointed because of the book's lack of documentation, i.e., whenever there is presentation of an experimental study or a fact, the author occasionally fails to cite the source, whether from a book or from an academic journal. because of this, interested scholars are discouraged to trace the original source to look for evidence."
4,Enlightening,"I found this book to be extremely enlightening on a variety of issues, not just unbroken curses. At times I felt it was a little bit over the top, and was appalled at the personal stories included, but who am I to judge? I do not know for fact what did or did not happen, I only know that it's very moving to read. I have learned a lot through reading this book, and realize I have a whole lot of work to do now..."
1,And these people have a problem with Harry?,"I happened upon this book quite by accident. I was looking for a bad example of ""Christian"" authorship and theology (Frank Peretti specifically) and found this.I thought I'd read it all after reading Neil Anderson books, but this is absolutely dreadful. I'm shocked and dismayed that this book even exists, much less that it can be found promoted on the bookshelves of Christian bookstores.My recommendation is burn this book and read your bible. Specifically Job where it is shown that Satan has NO power over us and can do NOTHING to harm us unless God grants him permission."
1,I have serious questions about the validity of this book....,"Fanciful. Unbelieveable. A book I would like to return and get my money back. Not well written. No documentation. Christians need to beware. Spiritual warfare is real but I am not sure ""Dr. Brown"" is."
1,What Terrible Lies,"This book would probably almost be good if it were not for the many and frequent terrible lies told about the Jewish people from Mr. Yoder. Having grown up Jewish in a tradtional home I know for certain one thing, no Jew would ever kill another, especially not in Israel."
1,Meh?,"You know something? I would much rather be a kind, open-minded wiccan than a bible-thumping, ignorant Christian. Rebecca Brown should think about this."
3,Almost happy,"when I was expecting the book i received a message stating that the item was undeliverable and i was advised to contact to post office.As I was new I was confused and even regretted ordering the book on line. But I contacted the publisher who sent the book and sent them email requesting explanation and that this was not a good experience for me, after about 8 hours I received an email that the book was resent and I also received the book (although delayed ) i was happy to receive it at last with out additional charge for the courier.Thanks"
4,Staying spiritually aware,"This is a marvelous book to own and reread. It helps one to understand scripturally what boundaries we as Christians need to establish in order to protect our lives, marriages, churches and nation. I highly recommend this book to anyone who senses there might be something holding them back from the life God has promised them through His word."
5,Wonderful book!,"Very good book. I wish her books were as thick as the Bible. It is so interesting all the things she talks about and has gone through. I love how she relates her explanations to examples of situations.Make sure to pray before reading books, as you would for any other book out there because God gives Wisdom and understanding like no one else! Please do not forget that God cares about us so much that He has servants such as Rebecca Brown write entire books to counsel us! Praise the Lord.""I am the resurrection and the life. Anyone who believes in me will live, even after dying."" John 11:25 NLT"
2,"Thought provoking, until the fantastical ""true"" stories and incredible antisemitism towards the end","Like many lies, this one contains enough elements of truth to make it appealing.The author equates the Jewish Kabbalah with some sort of diabolical cult. This is at best extremely uneducated--and at worst, extremely antisemetic. Kabbalah is an integral part of the Torah (five books of Moses), although one having no knowledge of Jewish spirituality might be convinced by Ms. Brown's description of ""Cabalistic"" ritual abuse. Ms. Brown makes herself out to be a fan of the infamous Protocols of the Elders of Zion.I urge readers to research Rebecca Brown (aka Ruth Irene Bailey) on Wikipedia and elsewhere on the net before subscribing to the beliefs in her books."
3,Hmmm...,Be educated in scripture to make your own judgments. This book isn't for young Christians. Be studying the scripture and praying if you read this book.
1,They killed it,"I love this album, but what a disappointment this remaster is. Thirteen Grammys and you brought up tons of noise, hiss and it sounds eons worse than the original CD/first re master? The quieter sections are unlistenable through the hiss. And they used so much compression that the whole thing sounds flat and devoid of any air. That pure pristine voice often sounds distorted and like it is oversaturating the microphones. What was once beautiful music sounds like it is drowning in thick midrange soup. Bad. I can't believe Barbra approved it. She should pull all the copies, fire the engineer and start all over. Boo (literal) hiss."
2,"A for effort, C for execution","One does have to applaud Barbra for the effort, for showing that she really does care about music, not just her own. Everyone knows about her forays into pop, rock and even disco. Alas, while her voice is lovely, it seems more like an album of lullabies than classical lieder. She actually did a more authentic classical performance of a Schubert song on her TV special ""Barbra Streisand and Other Musical Instruments."" Alas, this serious effort never comes close to showing the range of her voice that she played with in that 2 1/2 minute song. A missed opportunity."
1,why pay again when the original was good enough,"The original album was great and I've already reviewed its faults. However, here I am reviewing the addition of two new songs. ""An Sylvia"" by Schubert was never a great lieder. It was and still is a butter-churning piece of mediocrity. Even La Streisand cannot raise it to a new level. There WAS a reason it was left off the original album. ""Auf dem Wasser zu singen"", also by Schubert, didn't make it either, and the reasons are very evident to those who care to listen: it's dreary.So, buy Classical Barbra Remastered only if you value the remastering process. The additional two ""out-takes"" do NOT add added value."
2,Waste of your time unless you're into highbrow music,"Listened to this one probably once, I guess I just like pop music, because this stuff really strained my patience!Rejane"
5,Barbra has great versatility!,"I was a little skeptical when I received this album as a gift, but not any more!!! This is a great work by the great Streisand. I have been a fan since day 1 and I listen to this over and over, it is always stacked in my CD player. I also listen to it while falling asleep, try it! Best Streisand gift I have received. Only 1 complaint, album is not long enough."
4,Lullabies from a DIVA...,"It works. Barbra puts a very unique spin on classical music. Some tracks are rather unremarkable-- good bedtime music. My favorite songs are ""In Trutina"" and ""Brezairola."" The latter is one of my favorite Streisand efforts. The French lullaby, I read somewhere, has been used to calm patients in institutions for the mentally ill... Very soothing. Barbra is obviously not an opera singer, but she has never claimed to be one... So, if you're a Streisand fan, buy this album. If you're a fan of art songs, you might find this album flawed but interesting."
4,I had to laugh when I read the other reviews.,"I've been a Streisand fan since the early 1960s and a die-hard opera/classical vocal music fan since 1976. I'm now 63 and still love both with all my heart. Don't judge Barbra because she is not Margaret Price, Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, Renee Fleming, or Susan Graham. Just appreciate her singing and her obvious enjoyment in these songs. It's fun. Relax and enjoy it!"
4,I truly enjoyed this album,"What a nice surprise this was. I found ""Classical Barbra"" in a thrift shop, and never having heard it before, decided to take a chance on it. What a nice way to start a beautiful Saturday morning, listening to this recording. Since classical music is not my forte, it will take me several listenings to reach the level of ""I love it,"" but the potential for that is definitely there. Barbra's voice soothes the spirit, and the exquisite musicianship of the Columbia Symphony Orchestra (cond. Claus Ogerman) creates a beautiful synthesis with her remarkable vocal instrument.And at the risk of having some fatuous expert expel their knowledge and so-called superior tastes in my direction, let me whole-heartedly recommend ""Classical Barbra"" as a way to recover from the grind of the work week, and the wear and tear of living in our conflict-ridden world."
3,Still works but could be better,"My buddies and I play volleyball everyday at lunch and we've had this net for over a year now. It has held up longer than other nets but that's mainly due to the fact that we inserted another steel cable in the bottom tape of the net. The corners of the net have all torn from the grommetts so it will slide on the cables but it still works. For the price, I can't ask for much more from a net that gets used 5 days a week by grown men who don't necessarily follow the rules of not touching the net..."
2,Not for everyone,This is just a so-so recording. Not bad but nothing special either. My collection is huge but I very seldom play this one.
1,A Sad state of affairs,"If these are the top short story authors in the United States and Canada, we are in bad shape. Most of these stories simply aren't very interesting--I found the characters to be generally unsympathetic losers, and very little actually happens in most of the stories.One story, by Margaret Atwood, has some punch. Why don't you just lean against the shelf in the bookstore and read that one, then put the book back? You'll save some money that way, and you won't miss a thing."
4,Product review .,"V7 R15PS 15"" LCD Monitor was shipped and packaged so it arrived on time and received in good condition. product performance great at this time!!"
5,The Aeneid of Virgil (Bantam Classics),"I consider the primary difficulty in studying The Aeneid to be the introduction of more than 250 proper names in the first three books. This Bantam Classic includes the best glossary I have found in any translation or commentary. The Mandelbaum translation is also the one quoted by Professor Elizabeth Vandiver in her lectures ""The Aeneid of Virgil"" published by The Teaching Company."
4,The Aenid of Virgil,"This is an excellent example of classical literature. Mandelbaum excites his readers with his creative translating abilities. He really captures the essence of the classical genre. Virgil's masterpiece is indeed the very work that inspired Dante in his Divine Comedy trilogy. It is existential, authentic, and inspirational. Virgil's epic focuses on the historical vicissitudes of imperial Rome. The epic format is perhaps the only credible characterization that could possibly re-enact for the reader the empire that was Rome. An incredible read, a must for all classical enthusiasts, and the student alike."
3,locket review,"The locket iteslf looked nice, but it was way too small. I bought it for my 7 year old and it looked very tiny on her. I decided to return it and that experience was not what I expected. I though it would be very easy to get my money back, but that wasn't the case. Two weeks after I mailed the item, I realized I hadn't received any communication from amazon confirming the receipt of my item. I was worried that the item might have gotten lost in the mail so I e-mailed the returns department to inquire about it. They responded quickly that they had received the item and were processing the refund. I waited another two weeks and still no refund. I was not happy because I coudn't understand why it should take more than a month to obtain a refund. After calling them a couple of times I was able to get my refund. I feel that I shouldn't have to go through all that to obtain a refund."
4,Nice Necklace,"I bought this for my 5 year old grandaughter in memory of her dad who was killed in Iraq. She loved it. The locket is perfect for a young girl, however,the chain that came with it is very fine and difficult to fasten. I bought a sturdier chain to go with this locket. I am very pleased with this purchase."
1,Too small,This was a cute locket but far too small to put any sort of a photo in it . The only use it would serve would be a charm never to be opened. Not worth the price.
2,"It worked for two months, then it died.",The Optimus heater I ordered lasted for nearly two months before the heater element quit working.The warranty states that the shipping cost for repair is $25.00.
4,A good phone,"I have had this phone for about a year now. I think it is a very durable phone and is not a nusance. I have dropped it many times, and even in water. It has not broken at all and it works very well. I like a lot of the features- but it is very basic. It works well for me, and is a simple phone."
2,Slow starter...,The phone certainly is not going to overwhelm you with features. While the battery life is good. The phonebook is barely passable as it requires an entry for every phone number you want to store for a single person. But the most annoying thing is how long it takes from when you turn this phone on until when you can actually use it. I am about to upgrade to a different phone as I have managed to throw this one to the ground the last time in irritation.
5,Beautiful Lighter,"This is a REALLY nice lighter. I've owned many Zippo lighters and this is one of my favorites. Very quality construction, hinge works great, the lid aligns perfectly with the casing and it closes very tightly and securely. This is everything to expect from a genuine Zippo lighter. I hate to carry my Zippos with nicer finishes in my pocket due to scratches and other hazards but this one is my new ""everyday lighter"" that I plan on carrying with me for years."
3,Impulse purchase,"Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with this lighter and even if there were, I have learned, that ZIPPO would most likely fix it. I discovered the latter after purchasing this lighter (at a mighty fine price, I might add) to replace one I thought was broken forever. In my haste I selected the brass Venetian when I really wanted to match the aforementioned silver tone version. Alas, the silver has been fixed so now I own two lighters. I'm not a smoker but use my elegant Zippos to light my Adirondacks Tiki torches and campfires in the summer -- so I have one each for my gold and silver days."
3,sorry,"I wanted to buy them for my friends in China.But it arrived so late, I didnot see them.I think they should be nice."
1,wrong items,"i bought two of these. however, when i got them, one of them was silver. based on the original price tag, the silver one was cheaper. but i paid for the bronze one!!!feel i am cheated."
5,A true classic,"I first read this book when I was in my late twenties. I have fond memories of sitting with my best friend reading the poems aloud and laughing, crying and agreeing. I was thrilled to re-discover the book and have given copies to my daughter and daughter-in-law. Yes, the times have changed, but so much is the same that they, too, really enjoyed the poems.I have given copies of Viorst's later decade books to my friends for birthday gifts. They are all wonderful, but this one is definitely my favorite.Judith Viorst is such a versatile writer. My grandsons are crazy about her Alexander books, especially Alexander and the Terrible Horrible No Good Very Bad Day. Everyone can identify with that one."
5,Great way to get into mosses,"I've never purchased one of those books Amazon suggests when you're buying other books. But I'm glad I bought this one. Kimmerer is a scientist, a poet, a mother, a Native American and all these strands are blended in this remarkable book about her passion: bryophytes. Each chapter is a story that not only introduces fascinating information about these tiny but ubiquitous plants, but makes the entry into their world easy for a non-bryologist, AND leads to deep reflection about life. I found myself reading the book slowly, savoring and reflecting on each chapter. I plan to read it again before the year is out."
5,Orange...an excellent read,"I must say that Orange is truly an excellent read. I thoroughly enjoyed this book! It was almost impossible to put down. All of the characters are interesting. I left the book wanting to know more about them. I hope there will be more.I will definitely look for more from this author, A great job of writing. It had a constant flow that was very easy to follow. It managed to tug at my emotions and curiosities.I found myself emotionally charged with this writing, as it hit close to home. You can relate with what the characters are going through in their life. I am going to tell everyone to read this book."
1,Yawn.,Can music get any more tedious than this? Can a human being be a worse vocalist than Killdozer's vocalist? Will a less competent group of people ever record sounds together again?
3,Doesn't work for me.,"This heater is what I was looking for, a bolt in heating element to fit in my 6 gallon boat water tank, however it will not work for me. The printed specifications state that the height of this product is 14.5 inches, which would have worked perfectly, filling the length of the tank, however this heating element only extends 5"" into the tank and will only heat a small section of the water. It might bolt in universally, but it doesn't really replace the much longer element that was in there. Also, no ""detailed instruction manual"" was included."
4,Works but not as big as advertised,"As far as it's function, it works well, it is universal, easy to install and sturdy. It is, like the other reviewer states, NOT 14 inches long. That may have been the measurement of the package it came in but the element itself only extends approx 5-6 inches from the base. This ended up working out for me since I was using this for a DIY immersion circulator build but if you were trying to replace a heater in a tank you may be best looking elsewhere."
1,Always read review before you buy ...,Poor quality cable. Worked great at beginning but stop functioning after 1 month.Don't waste your money.
1,poor connection,I got these cables thinking the price was too good to be true. well it was. they are lousy. they continually lose connectivity and you have to go and wiggle the cables to regain it. I f somethings sounds too good to be true it probably is. (that is too good to be true.) Save your dollar and buy some quaility cables from walmart. ontop ofit iwas chharged 20 plus dollarsfor shipping on 2 hdmi cables and 2 tos link cables
4,Essential for Jesus Lizard/Touch and Go fans,"A little too close to the Birthday Party to be truly great, but nonetheless an essential document leading up to the insane brilliance of the Jesus Lizard. Yow manages to sound even more unrestrained in the acid-drenched, art powerhouse known as Scratch Acid. Where tJL is all tight lucidity, SA is a pummeling, amorphous nightmare."
4,"ahh,scratch acid.",just as good as i remembered.i'm so happy to finally find on disc.this is the real stuff. mandatory.just buy it.now.really.
4,Oldie but a Goodie,"I had long forgotten about this band. It wasn't until I heard a band called f.h. hill co. that I had remembered the existence of this unique and very ahead of their time line-up of guys who would go on to become members of bands like Rapeman, the JESUS LIZARD, Shellac, etc. Brilliant I tell you! BRILLIANT!"
4,The seeds of the Jesus Lizard,Stop! Add this one to your list! I have contempt for people who call themselves rock music fans and don't own this record in multiple formats.
1,This is the first video I ever rented when I got my VCR,I thought this was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Don't waste your money or your time on it.
2,Disappointingly shallow and unreal,"Neither of the Moores (whose characters are total ... here) are given much to work with in this manipultave, banal, and indifferently directed story about a little girl suffering from the Dreaded Movie Disease. As expected, it gets more pretentiously somber as it goes along, dragging sluggishly to a predictable finale. And in the second half, it just tries too darned hard to touch us."
5,Excellent film,I love this movie - I wish it could be available for DVD instead of vhs :( Dudley Moore did an excellent job as well as Mary Tyler Moore and Miss Healy. It was so sad at the end.Maribeth
3,Six Weeks VHS,"I viewed Six Weeks about 20+ years ago and remembered it as being ""charming."" I am a ballet fan so young Katherine Healy was of interest, and who wasn't a fan of Mary Tyler Moore? Strangely enough, the chemistry (due to Dudley Moore's height) didn't work for me anymore.It bothered me viewing the movie now; it did not when I was young?Six Weeks is a ""nice"" story and well acted. I will keep it in my movie library as it brings back the memories of the good old days. It's hard to obtain a print of this movie which proves others enjoy it also. Any fan of the two Moores or of Ms. Healy will thoroughly enjoy the movie."
3,Emotionally Flat,"Watching this film, I wanted to care about the characters, but found myself unable to really do so. The acting is credible; the story is good, but it just seems to fall flat. This should have been a tearjerker, but, notwithstanding that I tend to be overly sentimental, I found myself generally unmoved by the film; it lacked something."
3,INCOMPLETE!!!,"The audio portion(4 CDs) of the program was good with many heplful suggestions. However,the program was to have included a workbook and it did not. This, of course, lessened its value and effectiveness. Two of your customer service reps tried very hard to help me find out who or where to call to obtain a workbook but were unable to do so. I'm greatful for their efforts. I think it would be VERY helpful if you were to let customers know that a workbook is needed to get the most out of the program and that it's NOT included.Thank you very much for the opportunity to present my review. I hope it helps.Sincerely,Dan Diesti"
5,Splendid and Touching.....,The storys of Birch and Trudy and their family and friends will touch you and change you. I loved this book so much I bought extra copies to give as Christmas gifts. The Characters become as real friends and their trials and the way their faith sustains them through anything is truly remarkable reading. I would LOVE to see Hallmark or some Christian director make the whole Shiloh Legacy Series into a Mini-Series.
2,More like Mannheim Steamroller than David Phillips,"This was not the instrumental piano Christmas album I expected. I was prepared for some guitar accompaniment, but not all of the additional instruments. If you want a piano Christmas album, this isn't for you."
4,Locking the barn door...,"I bought this wheel lock, which we call ""The Claw"" (rather than the Club), after my car was stolen. I had thought it was hard to break into my car, and it is relatively hard, but the thief had a shaved key, and opened the door, started the car, and drove off like he owned it. So after I got the car back, I bought a steering wheel lock.I like this one because it has four arms to grip the wheel (hence The Claw), and is bright yellow. I'm thinking that a potential thief will see it and pass on to another car, rather than bother with trying to break it.It works well, is easy to use, and has a small key that doesn't take up too much room in my pocket. I recommend it."
3,great but completely INCOMPLETE,"This cd is great but it is incomplete. I enjoy The greatest hit album more. I believe they need to do a greatest complete hits cd. Some great songs are missing from Super Hits and although The Greatest Hits has quite a few great songs it is also missing a favorite of mine; ""You're Gone"". Super Hits is missing such trademark songs as Meet in the Middle, Holdin, In a Week or Two, Walkin Away and Norma Jean Riley. I wish they would do a complete set of top hits on one cd so fans would not have to keep swithching cd's to get complete enjoyment of their work, but this cd is still great but I would suggest checking out Diamond Rio Greatest Hits before choosing."
2,Share the Care,"If you want to spend the rest of your life filling out charts, calling people and constructing a complicated organizational structure, then this book is for you. The idea is simple--GET HELP! But the book is so complicated about how to get that help that it will drive you crazy."
5,If you are a sole caregiver you need this book...,"If you are losing someone you love doing everything yourself, accepting help is very hard. When you are ready, read this book, get someone to help you facilitate the meeting and get the support you need. I did and had a very successful meeting...and now I have the support around me to look after my mom AND do fun things with her...not just the practical."
5,my cusin and i would like to try luvs,iam a kid .i just read a review about a kid who wear luvs .my cusin had the idea to buy luvs to buy it both of us are going to it to try it.i would like to met the girl who wears luvs.
5,I LOVE LUVS,I Love Luvs! I love to ware Luvs. I like using Luvs. They are the best diapers I have ever worn. I think these diapers are great because1. They feel good2. They have cute picturesAnd 3. THEY ARE CHEAP!Ware Luvs and feel like a baby!
3,Historic masterpiece,"Being introduced to the Big Black at college in the 1980's, where they fast became my favorite band, was an incredible experience.I adored their music, it was everything great about alternative/indie music pre Nirvana and Teen Spirit...that is the vast majority of people hated it! Or didn't understand it! Or were confused by it! Or were just of the opinion that because it wasn't in the top 20 or wasn't played on mainstream radio or it wasn't some safe old band such as Led Zepp or Floyd, that it had to be crap!It really felt like my own special music and they were great day's! Sadly I have outgrown this album now...19 has turned 35!! It seems so harsh and silly now! And unlistenable!For those still interested in skinny, creepy Steve Albini, then be aware that the studio tracks ie Atomizer, Songs About F**king are far superior to this live album which doesn't really do the work of the Big Black great justice.""Now it's on to Chicago and let's win there!""Blair"
2,Big Black did a good cover once of Cheap Trick's 'He's a ...,"Whore."" Cheap Trick fans should check it out!"
4,Fiction or Nonfiction?,"I checked this book out from the library and was thrilled to read it. I read the first chapter and found it interesting but seemingly written for younger readers. I kept reading and came across this sentence on page 39: ""Carefully, she placed the two letters with her manuscript on top of her clothes, zipped the bag shut, and walked out of her room."" The person this sentence refers to is Phyllis Wheatley, a woman packing her bag for a trip in 1773. Zippers weren't invented until 1893. This left a bad taste in my mouth, and I lost interest in the book. I wondered what else could be wrong and how many liberties had been taken to make it entertaining. I never finished it, and concider it young adult fiction."
2,Historical Fiction?,"I was highly disappointed in this book. It is difficult to tell what is historical fact and what is fiction in this book. No primary sources are consulted for this piece, leading me to believe that the author was more interested in writing fiction about her historical figures than doing research on them. The section on Mercy Otis Warren alone has obvious errors regarding dates of Mercy's birth, her brother's college career and her marriage. If you choose to read this book be warned that this should be read for fictional value and not for factual information."
5,First rock show I saw,"Growing up in Palo Alto CA my 8th grade buddies and I had the dumb luck of riding our bikes over to the Stanford Fox movie theater on University Ave one summer evening in 1974 to see the Son's of Champlin (for you Elvin Bishop fans). Some noname band that was a spin out of Santana was opening. WOW!I had discovered Genesis, Yes, ELP, Camel, Return to Forever, Zappa==the litany of art/jazz and fusion rock bands, but these guys kicked ass like no one I had heard--and since only Steve Morse and the Dixie Dregs have mixed fusion so well with another major influence (latin blues for Journey, southern rock for the Dregs)in my humble opinion. I've probably seen over 500 shows, but the Journey shows of the early 70's were seminal. Listen to this album on headphones and float back to Winterland. Just don't set the couch on fire with yer spliff!"
5,A Very Different Journey From The Hit-Making Band,"Journey's self-titled debut, and the two follow-ups before the band added vocalist Steve Perry and went mainstream, shows a band with roots in artists as diverse as Leon Russell, Santana, Joe Cocker, the Allman Brothers Band, Steely Dan, the Grateful Dead, Genesis, the James Gang, the Meters, Little Feat, Booker T. & the MGs, Humble Pie, Yes, the Marshall Tucker Band, Traffic, Grand Funk Railroad, Chicago, Rare Earth, and the Mahavishnu Orchestra. These songs blend jazz-rock fusion, blues-rock, R&B, hard rock, and progressive rock in a totally unique way that will always sound fresher than the later hit-period albums. Buy this CD along with LOOK INTO THE FUTURE and NEXT, and you won't be disappointed."
4,Now This Is Journey,"I began listening to Journey in the early 70's. This is how I remember them. They had a progressive edge that usually came out of England. This is when musicians could sing, write good songs, and play their instruments. Many of them were classically trained. The song tracks To Play Some Music, Of A Lifetime, and Kohoutek are excellent. Don't expect any girlie pop songs here...this is before Steve Perry...That was when I stopped listening to them. Now this is Journey!!!"
5,SOLID MUSIC-THE TRUE BEST OF JOURNEY,"The only Journey albums I own are the first four--yeah, I know Infinity has Steve Perry's overpowering vocals but it is a very musical album and I have to admit it grabs me-(especially Neil Schon's solo on Winds of March)..........but this album is a tribute to the brilliant musicianship of Journey. The rhythm section is as solid as they come and Neil Schon's solos make the music soar into space (like the album cover)......Kahoutek is a good example of these guys giving it all they got....Aynsley Dunbar can really lay it down.....the vocals on this album are so much less obtrusive than during the Perry phase,,,and Greg Rolie has a good voice to complement this material.......a good balance of vocals to music.........wholeheartedly recommended."
5,A truly remarkable album,"In the modern age of pop bands that are here today and gone tomorrow, one only has to slip this cd in to really appreciate it. Okay,so it is mostly an instrumental undertaking,you can`t forget that Journey only was intended to be a studio band. If you want a deeply rich, fulfilling musical experience then this is the cd you have been searching for."
4,Fresh view on productivity management,"An excellent book on field of productivity accounting - introduces to Sumanth's approach, where productivity means more than just units per labour hour. Easy to read and detailed enough for applying the framework on a company."
1,skunk bait,Did not work at all. My neighbor used canned dog food and caught four or five skunk. Don't waste your money.
2,Songs all sound the same,I love listening to IL DIVO and enjoy Sebastian's voice especially.....However this CD does not do him or his voice justice.
5,Nice morbid feeling.,"Do you ever feel that horror nowadays is stuck in one place? Like if they can't scare or impress you anymore? Not with this book.Try to remember that feeling of being alone in your dark room when you where 5, thinking that the monster would soon attack, and it is such a live moment; that's how it made me feel, and I love it.Another good thing about it; every story is different. You don't get stuck with the same formula on every page you turn. Is like if you could jump into a unique world everytime you change from story.I really recommend it, especially if you have short attention spam, this will really work for you.You'll be sucking your fingers after you're done.A little note: Me, as a non avid English speaker(or reader), I found it easy to read, If I can read it, so can you."
4,Creepy...,"As a student of Gemma's, I was eager to read something from her short story collection. I'm not really a big horror fan but like to think I'm open to reading almost anything that's supernatural.However, the supernatural side of Gemma's writing seems to be secondary as she really delves deep into the psyches of her characters and in a very realistic and gutteral way. She has a cerebral style to her horror writing and its very effective.So give Kissing Carrion a shot. It's perverse, crude and gross but also very well-written, honest and remarkably creative."
5,A must read for all Strategy evangelists!,"As a keen student of Strategy, I found this book in amazing clarity in thoughts and flow. No book had such impact over me after the great article by Michael E.Porter (HBR 1996) - What is Strategy?. That article had broken the myth of Operation Effectiveness being portrayed as strategy.This book goes beyond C.K.Prahalad with his BOP concept and Prof. Stuart L.Hart (Award winning Article: ""Strategies for sustainable World"" & Book: ""Capitalism at the Crossroads: The Unlimited Business Opportunities in Solving the World's Most Difficult Problems"") to introduce strategies that could help us look at the World differently - both as opportunity and threat.It is a must read for people looking beyond their four walls. All Strategy evangelists must read this book before they preach."
4,A Commendable Start,"This is a commendable start to a discussion that is long overdue. Why are inhabitants of this planet failing so miserably to develop themselves -- and improve conditions on the planet? Most of us should be able to step back and develop a comprehensive plan for going forward. Instead, we remain trapped in institutions that are ineffective and downright dangerous. As the author points out, all of our dominant institutions have failed to deliver the goods.I rated the book at 4 stars because I thought that there could have been fewer lists and more detail on how we develop the power to implement strategy that is effective. (Is this power to be achieved by starting up a new investment management firm as the author has done?)One of the keys to making a strategic shift is likely found in the background and interests of the author himself. He draws inspiration from both Eastern and Western traditions and has, through his work, been exposed to a diverse range of cultures around the world."
1,The worst book even read,"This is the worst book I have ever read. The author has no idea what he wants to convey or achieve through this book. It looks like the author is writing a gap analysis in a consulting overdrive.Anyone reading 'economist' for a year will have better grasp of the topics he is discussing in this book. Pure waste of money, time and energy!!The book is rated 'F'."
2,Major design flaw,"It took my cats about 5 minutes to figure out how to ""cheat"" the timer on this feeder. They can just stick their paws into the tube where the food comes out, and get food whenever they want. This product would definitely not be safe for any cat that needs have his/her food intake controlled. It might be fine for a large dog with paws too big to fit into the tube."
2,"Works for a bit, then they figure it out!","Like some other reviewers here, my cat figured out how to trick the autopetfeeder. Now he's not a particularly bright cat, so it took him about 5 weeks to catch on. During those 5 weeks, he actually did lose weight!! The petfeeder kept him on a regimented diet and kept ME from overfeeding him. Then, he noticed that the food was coming out of the little hole, so he started sticking his paw in there. A few jiggles, and voila instant snack! I'm still fiddling with it, but it seems hopeless. With a small re-design, this product would be perfect. As it stands, it is useless."
3,This series is developing nicely...,"This is book #2 in the Inspector Roderick Alleyn mysteries. Alleyn and his journalist friend Nigel Bathgate (who is his Watson) go to the theater, where a performer is shot with real bullets instead of blanks. Alleyn's job is complicated since most of the suspects are actors...how does he know who is telling him the truth?I figured out the murderer early, which is usually not a good thing. But the plot kept my interest til the end. I'm also starting to bond with the main characters - more so than the first book, and I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the series."
5,Superb narration brings this great mystery novel to life!,"Nagaio Marsh's Enter A Murderer appears unabridged, with James Saxon narrating the story of a theater murder and an actor. It's up to Inspector Roderick Alleyn to sort out whodunit. The narration brings the story to life, with all its strengths."
2,Very easy exams,"The explanations are pretty good, but the exams in this book were way too easy. It barely went over organic chemistry. The PCAT exam is much harder."
2,Just read carefully,"This may work but be careful and do not buy this for the car metal parts. The directions say : do not recomend for sheet metal on cars"" - that warning is not given clearly on the advertisement/product description on Amazon and you cannot return this product."
3,Not sure what to make of this.,"This product promised a black paintable primed surface when placed on a rusty spot. I used this on old metal patio furniture and did not receive that result...but I could have used it wrong? I just painted over the places where I applied it. It appears as if the rusting stopped, but that could have been due to the Rustoleum paint."
5,Excellent cast iron cookware,"I purchased this fryer and a 5QT dutch oven from Farberware during a sale. It was priced lower than Lodge and every bit as good. However, it is made in China while Lodge is USA made. The preseasoning is very good and the pan was immediately usable. I use it when I need a screaming hot pan for searing. For that, nothing beats cast iron."
5,Woodcarving essential,"If you don't have the setup or experience polishing a blade to unreasonable sharpness I would recommend this detail knife as it is sharper than an exacto right out of the package. Since I have the setup and experience I find some benefit in polishing an exacto, however the increase in detailing ability is marginal at best. Overall, this detail knife is well worth the investment."
1,DON'T BUY,"Save yourself the trouble, you can get a lot nicer pair for about the same price. Try the Sennheiser 501.These aren't very comfortable, they get tiring after a while, the plastic thing that allows it to be collaspable digs into your skull. They have 1% Noise reduction, being nice. Mine snapped in half at the plastic part that allows it to be collaspable."
5,Excellent customer service,"Buy from this company. They stand behind their products and replace items quickly if there is a problem. I am extremely impressed with how they handled my issues, which ended up being camera related and not the result of bad memory cards. I will buy their cards exclusively because of this."
4,A Small Christmas,"A great Christmas story in the Fireman Small series - I got it for my Christmas collection, but now my grandchildren are looking for more books about Fireman Small."
5,What you see is what you get. Thanks.,What you see is what you get.Order was shipped and recied as promised.I Glued the poster on Canvas and it's hanging in my office.I love it.thank you!
5,Exactly what i was looking for!,"lets face it, we can't just go out and buy a canvas reprint of Picasso. Or a real print for that matter... so why not frame this beautiful poster print? This is a great print, with great quality, and cheaper then anything i could find. Exactly what i was looking for!"
4,"Good, but ""Artist"" is a good alternative","This is a great book with many of Tolkien's most wonderful pictures (those used in a series of LOTR calendars featuring his art), but rather than pay the usually very high price for it (it is long out of print), I would recommend ""JRR Tolkien: Artist and Illustrator"" (also found on amazon.com), which contains nearly all of the paintings, etc. from ""Pictures by JRR Tolkien"" in addition to a great many of Tolkien's pictures not included in ""Pictures"" (200 total, as opposed to ""Pictures""'s 47). ""Artist"" is still in print, so is much more affordable. The only advantage of ""Pictures is that it has many of the colored versions of Tolkien's pen-and-ink drawings (colored by H. E. Riddet) not included in ""Artist"". While the most obsessive Tolkien fans will want both ""Pictures"" and ""Artist"", most will be content without the far more expensive (and less inclusive) ""Pictures."""
4,This is a great price for amazing product,"As soon as I received this sewing machine, I disappointed from the color fade on the body, but when I start using it, it amazed me to see that it can go through the jeanes very easy, it is a strong machine, all the body made from steel, and I love it now."
3,"""Okay"" Doubler","These doublers are very soft against baby's skin however, their added absorbancy is just ""okay."" I've never used the doubler with a Kissaluv's brand cloth diaper however! (I have used it with BunGenius, Happy Heiney and BabyKicks brand cloth diapers.)"
3,Good Supplement,My dogs are full bred labs 9 and 11 years old and I give them this everyday with their food. A 2.5lb amount will last a long time. My main beef with this is that you can get it direct from Gateway for 20.00 shipped. 16.09 shipping from this seller?? Come on. Glad I found a better deal.
2,"Good Intentions, but Misleading Premise","The author has provided a fascinating look at history and has nicely integrated sexuality and spirituality. She also makes excellent points that reflect both the problems and solutions of today's culture. Unfortunately, her premise is based upon the sacred prostitute as an ideal archetype of the feminine essence, which limits the value and capacity of the feminine to her willingness to prostitute herself, sacred or not. The author forms words like a feminist, but I'm hard-pressed to believe that true feminism would attempt to narrow the female potential to a role of simply beauty, sensuality, and a single-minded willingness to please the male. I'm afraid the author's enthusiasm for her concept has blinded her to the limitations of the sacred prostitute as an adequate archetype to express the multifacetted potential of the feminine spirit."
5,A stellar reference to the kaleidoscope of gang terminology.,"This book is an absolute ""Must Have"" for anyone needing to learn about the meaning of gang terminology. Included are thousands of terms you've heard, plus thousands you haven't. The ""slang"" is referenced against the gang groups that use them, so you're sure not to confuse one gang's terminology w/ another's. Its format makes it read just like a dictionary, allowing for fast, easy retrieval of terms."
2,Another attempt to ring a few more dollars from desperate fans,"As much as I've like Rick, Bun E., Robin, Jonand what's-his-name, the other Bass player(s)over the years, it's getting a bit too muchwhat with all these compilations. The pics hereare from the 'Lack of Luxury'/'Busted' Era ofmediocore 'Trick. It's nice the great song fromthe vastly underrated 'The Doctor', ""It's OnlyLove"" is on this skimpy 10 cut deal, but ""If YouNeed Me"", which was a retracked video (and a prettygood one, too) and Busted are way too much 'Bustedoverkill' here. Busted, Woke Up With A Monster andIn Colour get my vote for 'least best' TricksterLPs of alltime. Back 'N Blue and Wherever Would IBe would have been better. The best Cheap Trickrelease of all time is still 'in the can' as theysay. A compilation of both the Doctor and Standingon the Edge, two of their best four LPs of alltime.The other two? Why One on One and Next Postion Please,of course. Long live Jon Brant, especially with CT!"
1,"Ouch, be careful with this one...","I used the Quicker Clicker line of mechanical pencils for years. They are built to last with high quality plastic and metal pieces.Unfortunately, I learned about their greatest drawback the hard way. The metal sleeve the lead advances out of does not retract. I always carry pencils in my pocket and I did not know the metal sleeve had poked through my jeans. When I quickly moved my arm across it, the metal sleeve caught my skin and I ended up with a 4 inch rip across my forearm. The scar is slowly healing but my distaste for this pencil never will.If you plan to leave this pencil in a jar next to your desk, it will serve you for years and you will be very happy with it. If you're like me and carry a writing utensil in your pocket, beware!!!"
4,Best show on TV in a very long time!,"Although uneven at the beginning of the season, the second season of Friday Night Lights still packed the emotional and dramatic punch of season one, furthering developing the arcs of these characters' lives with sensitivity and authenticity. The show's writing, acting and production is unlike anything I have seen on network television and maybe that's why this show has still yet to reach a wider audience.It is a show that makes you think, feel and want to share the experience with others, like all good art should. It is a beautifully crafted show and the fact that many can't figure out how to market it, speaks to the very thing that makes it great. This show is not about football, or Texas but rather is a lovely slice of American life, capturing the human spirit of this country in the ordinary lives and everyday experiences of a small town. Buy both seasons and treat yourself to a rare treat in network television. It will not disappoint."
3,Huge Drop in Quality from First Season,"I was one of those people who got scarily hooked on the first season. I love the show so much, it was surprising to find myself bored during many of the second season episodes.As others have written, the contrived plotlines made it feel more manipulative of the audience as opposed to being a well-done drama. And the authenticity of the show was hurt by just plain wierd script writing (e.g., high school kid confesses to murder and no one in town notices...) Lastly, some of the characters' personalities change without any apparent cause (I, for one, found the coach's wife starting to regress to a shrill brat at times).Word is the third season returned to greatness, but unless your a huge fan, I didn't think this season was worth it."
5,My favorite show,"With all the trash that is broadcast on TV these days, I can't understand why NBC would do away with a decent show like this one ---- one that has exceptional acting and a great story line. Surely there are many of us who want this show to continue whether on NBC or some other network. I won't give up hope just yet."
5,Friday Night Lights,I agree I admit I just started watching the show this season (although just watched season 1 on DVD)and it is a fantastic show and a lot better then much of the stuff on tv. Also teens and adults can both enjoy the show because it involves both. Hope they keep it on.
2,Very disapponiting,"Having loved the first season I was extremely disappointed in season 2. The stories are tedious and depressing. The constant argueing is simply irritating - nothing more. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because the characters of Tyra and Lyla are just so good looking that I couldn't completely hate it. Also, I believe, due to he writer's strike the season ended rather abruptly - in a way I was happy about that because I couldn't stand the sight of ""Smash"" anymore nor the near constant stuttering of Matt Saracen and Julie Taylor - I mean give it a break already. Let's hope season 3 is better."
4,Nothing deep for this review,"Just a short one -- Friday Night Lights 2 is a heart-warming and sometimes funny show. Many times it makes me laugh; sometimes it takes me back to my high schoold days in the States.There are shortcomings though, the worst of it being the ""ending"", which clearly does not qualify for the word. What happened to the season's final games? What happened to, well, every lines of the whole story? It just leaves you saying, ""What the heck?"" Also, I think there are way too many similar storylines on teenage love affairs. The plots keep repeating and repeating, and you wonder why they cannot develop something else. Anyway, it is still pretty good overall, and I would recommend it to anyone with an interest to American football."
3,Incomplete season,"This is truly one of the best series on TV. Great casting. Great story lines. But, amazingly, incomplete. Not only are not all of the episodes included in the 4 disc set, but the ENDING episode was not included. Like reading a good book with the last chapter left out. so when you start the the third season (also incomplete) you don't know what the heck happened between the last episode on the DVD of 2 and the first episode on the DVD of 3. I felt cheated and swindled."
5,FNL Update,Since the last review announcing the return of FNL the deal has be done. FNL Season 3 will begin October 1 for DirecTV subscribers on Channel 101. The NBC broadcast will debut approx 3-4 mos later.
3,Good but much to be desired,"I was really looking forward to this season. watched the first season and loved it. second season is just as good, however there were a couple of things that really detracted from a 5 star review.the whole smash williams scandal seemed like [..], they could have figured out a better way for him to have gotten in trouble.and my major complaint- it leaves you hanging. there is absolutely no closure, I thought this was supposed to be a ""season"" what happened with the football season, did they make the playoffs or what??? really, it was just a bad place to stop."
5,Love It - Friday Night Lights - Season 2- DVD set,"great value for the money - great series - very highly recommend it to everyone. Extremely well-acted, and characters are great - plots are very realistic and fun to watch. You will love it if you like to watch HS football too!"
4,best tv series ever,This tv series is the best one I have ever seen. Well worth the watch. The quality of the DVDs was pretty good as well.
1,Loopy Stupid Camera Work Ruins Potentially Great Show,"This series had everything: great concept, fine actors, excellent scripts. Then some lame-o decided that it would be cool to film it with all kinds of random spastic zooming, rapid cutting, and, worst of all, unsteady cam--you know, the image shakes as if some drunk were recording it without SteadyShot or some other image stabilization. Many viewers are sickened by this faux amateur camera work. People wonder why this series didn't catch on. Well, the reason is quite obvious: the camera work is, literally, quite nauseating. What a shame!"
2,Do not recommend,"Going tapless was a bad idea. It only takes a minutes or two to clean the groove and apply the tape. The visors were constantly coming loose. I tried applying my own tape and even glue, but they just would not adhere as nicely as the ones that have adhesive on them. I definitely recommend going with adhesive visors."
5,Smooth as Silk (so far at least!),"This PSU looks great and performs great. I am using it to power an ASUS A8R32-MVP motherboard, AMD Athlon FX-60 CPU, ATI X1900XT-X graphics card, four SATA II hard drives, couple of DVD drives, high-end audio card from Germany, and other miscellaneous components. So far, it has done this without even a hiccup.I have a fairly tall case, so it was easy to tuck the extra power cables away. Some folks may prefer a PSU with modular cables, which I have in another computer, but I usually end up using most of the cables anyway.Connection of the main power cable, however, did require a glance at the manual (at least it did for me) because all of my motherboards use a 24-pin connector, whereas OCZ has split their Outlet Power connector into a 20-pin cable and a 4-pin cable. It was not intuitively obvious to me how these two parts connected."
5,Better than I expected,This is the quietest PSU I've heard. When I got it I couldn't believe how big it was and worried it might not fit into my case. It fit just fine. I like the way the cables are marked as to what they are for and the cables are wrapped for protection and cable management. The blue light is nice also.
4,Good power supply,"I bought 3 of this PSU for system i built, its working great as the OCZ customer support great too."
1,must have got a bad unit,"Its a brick, turns system fans for 1/10th of a second. Tested it on my old msi system same results. Took my old 450 w power supply out of my old system tested it in my new one, and the new system works fine. Will be doing a return on this very bad boy. Spoke with Hazel from Amazon, she was very nice and has got a new ocz 700 watt power supply shipping out and emailed me a return label. Tanks Amazon, for standing by the products you sell."
5,Solid after 3+ years!,"I've had this powering my system for 3+ years now and still ticking. It's survived a new motherboard, a new kit of memory. It seems like I couldn't kill this thing if I tried! I highly recommend this power supply. Whether gaming or just surfing the web, it has plenty of juice to get the job done. Great PSU! Highly recommend."
4,A very good book!,"Isles of the South Pacific tells you all about, you guessed it... The isles of the south pacific. These include, Tahiti, The Cook islands, Samon, Tonga, New Zealand, Fiji, New Caledonia, New Hebrides, The Solomons, and New Guinea. With all the stunning photographs from the National Geographic Society!Although this book is rather outdated... But it's still very interesting as well as educational. And at the price of only a penny plus shipping and handling, what have you got to lose?"
5,Amazing!,"My two year old will actually sit still for this entire book. We have several copies, one for the car, his room, the playroom. Inevitably he will always ask for ""Abbot I"" as he calls it. The illustrations are great and it is perfect for kids. I agree with whomever said it is tough to find books about Orthodox Christianity for children. This one is a MUST HAVE!"
5,"More Season Sets, Please!","Beverly Hills 90210 is one of the BEST drama series, I have ever watched! So far, CBS/Paramount has released the first 7 seasons, which I have collected.CBS/Paramount should keep up the good work releasing Beverly Hills 90210 in season sets.Season 8 is where Brandon, Kelly, Steve, David, Donna, and Valerie enter the real world. They also meet Carly Reynolds, Noah Hunter, and Steve's future wife Janet Sosna, in season Eight.Beverly Hills 90210 The 8th Season should be released in 7-disc set containing all 30 episodes.Please keep releasing Bevely Hills 90210 in Seasons sets!"
3,Wear and tear.,"Beverly Hills, 90210: Season Eight is when this groundbreaking drama started losing steam. The storylines became bizarre and lifeless and Hilary Swank was suddenly cut from the show without warning. I believe this was Jason Priestley's last year with the show and Season 9 and 10 were not the same without him - he was the heart and soul of this '90s hit. Jennie Garth is one of my favorites but even her character, Kelly Taylor started getting annoying especially with that whole amnesia storyline, blah! Donna (Tori Spelling) and David (Brian Austin Green) finally seal the deal and the gang graduates from College. Pretty much a safe, bland season but not as horrible when other shows jump the shark."
3,"decent show, terrible transfer","On the whole this set was exactly what we've been getting for the last 7 boxesHOWEVER, the transfer/encode on the final disk is awful, the final episode of the Wedding of Brandon and Kelly has really terrible ""slo-mo"" moments where the movement of the actors is jumpy and jerky (like the end of act bumpers on teh Melrose latter seasons) which really detracts from watching the episodeI really hope this is an abberation rather than the standard for the final two seasons"
3,One of the worst season.,"It's probably one of the worst season of the show for me. The stories weren't that interesting and Brandon... god, I've had enough of him already. Even newcomer Noah is a real drag plus a bad match for Donna and will always be until he leaves the show for good. And with these horrible music changes the season became even more boring and disappointing. Way to go CBS dvd, thanks for ruining it even more for me..."
5,Excellent TV Show from the 90's!,"Excellent series. It is too bad that Shannen Doherty is not a part of the show anymore, but this is still a great season. I really recommend it."
2,"Easy to use, but very little pick up.","Two teeny, weeny amps are not enough power to waste twenty Washingtons on, so if you want light weight and convenience just go garage sale-ing to find a used dustbuster. It has equal power and half the fun is looking."
1,sweet Jesus this is bad,"The readings are threadbare and designed to provoke foregone conclusions. Oh and another thing, the whole book aspires to look like a webpage. The final verdict: brainless and charmless--no way to go through life.Put this book to sleep."
4,Epidemiology of Infectious Disease,I am pleased with my recent purchase. The book is in excellent condition and I was able to save 75% off what my university bookstore's selling price!
4,"Good yoyo lube, adequate strings","The lube in this kit is a good thick lube, excellent for making your yoyo more responsive (if you want to lubricate your yoyo and not increase the response, get some yoyojam thin lube). The strings are nice too, basic cotton, nothing special."
3,ok....,"its very good for basic yoyo's but if you have a nice ball bearing the lube messes up the spin time but helps it be more responsive. as for the strings, they work just fine."
1,DON'T BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK FROM PENN STATE IND,"THIS DEFECTIVE REMOTE BURNED OUT MY DUST COLLECTOR MOTOR, COSTING $290 FOR REWIND JOB, THEN TRIED TO DO IT AGAIN BEFORE I CAUGHT IT. MANUFACTURER PENN STATE IND SAID WITH OUT COPY OF RECEIPT THEY WILL DO NOTHING! (WHO KEEPS ALL RECEIPTS FOR $60 ITEMS?) WHEN I COMPLAINED, THEY ACCUSED ME OF BEING A CROOK WHO FOUND THIS REMOTE IN A SCRAP PILE, AND WAS TRYING TO EXTORT THEM FOR A NEW UNIT! OTHER COMPANIES MAKE PRODUCTS SIMILAR TO PENN STATE IND, DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND BUY FROM SOMEONE WHO UNDERSTANDS CUSTOMER SERVICE AND PRODUCT QUALITY."
4,A Star and A Cross,"As the fate of one child, Hannah, unfolds in this moving tragedy of Nazi horror, a mystery is solved. Or is it? In A Star and A Cross, we will travel to Lithuania with an investigative writer searching for a truth that haunted her mother for fifty years. The trip and the search disturb the seeming tranquility of the small village, as an innkeeper and Sister Sarah gradually reveal secrets long buried. We too travel back in time, experiencing a myriad of emotions evoked by the powerful storytelling of Harriet S. Sherman. Hannah will live in our memory long after we finish reading her story!"
5,Great Read!,"Through Dr. Andrysco's techniques that I learned from this book, I was able to do a task I thought was nearly impossible - train my dog. I was easily able to make my dog 100% housebroken through the methods he has used on thousands of other dogs. I'm eagerly awaiting another publication from Dr. Andrysco (and I hope he checks out his book reviews... maybe he will decide to write one just for me)!"
4,A view from another angle,"I first read this book in college when I had my first dog. Its something that makes you think differently. Now I'm married and I have my wife and daughter reading this. The tips aren't challenging at all, and give you a different perspective. This book is written with taste to keep you interested and a little humor."
5,Happy Pets,"Dr. Andrysco's book, ""Tricks I Taught My Master"", is a must have for all pet owners. His comprehensive techniques are easy to follow and produce results. With the help of Dr. Andrysco's book my pets and I live happy, content lives together. I respect and love my pets unconditionally and in return they respect and obey me now."
4,Solutions for misbehaving pets,"Tricks I Taught My Master covers a wide range of topics important to both the owner of a new puppy and the long-time dog owner. Dr. Andrysco presents basic obedience training, but also offers techniques for correcting many of the problems behaviors some dogs develop - chewing, housebreaking, biting, etc.Easy to read and has a humorous twist of presenting the viewpoint of his own companion, Happy."
1,Kyle does not deserve the word comedian,WTF!I shut this off after 10 minutes because it was too painful to continue. This is probably the least funny comedy special I have ever seen in my life.
1,The Absolute Worst Yet!,"Wow!I must say this guy is the worst comedian of all time! His bland, childish humor was incredibly stupid and annoying ... all rolled up in one!!!!If you want:1. the most politically correct material (North Western blandness)2. to roll your eyes in tear jerking madness of stupidity3. to be bored to tears4. to look at the clock in anticipation of this joker's bit to endThen look no futher! The worst comedy stand up of all time is right here waiting for you!Please Kyle ... Cease your act!"
1,Horrible trash,"Occasionally they work. Sometimes my Yamaha CDRW drive will recognize them, sometimes not at all. Sometimes the DVD drive will recognize them, sometimes not at all. Lots of problems with reading them after they've been written to. If my drive can't recognize them, I can't rewrite them. These are worthless."
2,MEMOREX 3202-3406 4x Rewritable CDs,"I'm sorry, but I've had lots of trouble. Three of the disks were unusable (couldn't be formatted). Two others have gone bad within two weeks of my starting to use them: I used them as backup disks for only about 5 minutes a day; suddenly they refused to accept any more data, even though only 25% of the disk space was used. I'm almost afraid to try using the others."
4,"Smaller than they look, but perfect","I saw these and thought that they were adorable. After much debate, I bought them. Needless to say, I was quite surprised when I got them and they were really small. However, I wore them for the first time today and they are PERFECT. My job involves being on the phone all day, basically. These were small enough that they didn't bother me with my headset on! I was a bit surprised at the size of them for the price, but otherwise, they are perfect!"
2,Too small,They were much smaller than it looks in the picture! They are for kids! I didn't return them because maybe I'll find a little girl to give them to.
2,Please see my photo under customer images,Was incredibly disappointed after opening the box and the lovely blue drawstring bag they came in only to find itty bitty earrings. They look cheap and disposable. Gave them two stars because they would be a cute gift for a kid.
4,great danty earrings!!,"The earrings are perfect for wearing to work. My only bit is that they aren't as shiny as I'd hoped them to be. Overall, though, I'm very satisfied with this purchase."
2,Smaller then a penny,"I typically have great experiences with Amazon, however this time was not so great. The earrings were way smaller then I expected, to the point they became less noticeable then I desired. Fragility of them also seemed to be an issue.Upon the return, the postal service (USPS) took over two weeks for it to get to Amazon...or Amazon dragged their feet. I'm not sure when they received the return.Shipping to me was typical Prime, no damage to it."
4,extordinary hardcore blah!,"although the lungs ep is perty weak (except for the kick@$$ ""steelworker"", this is definitive hardcore. steve albini, to me, is a genius in the music world, but in real life... nevertheless, he is 100% real and his work still stands strong over a decade later"
4,Rewound is Hot,"I do not know what the other reviewer was listening to but this remix cd is nice. You have to listen to this for what it is and not what you think it should be. The reggae remixes are nice and funky. The remix of Until the morning is nice. Not as good as the orginal. I am a little bias as the original is one of my favorite thievery tracks! I give 4 star, as it is hard for me to give remix CDs 5 stars. If you a thievery fan or just a fan of good music you must buy this."
4,Nice!,"It took a little bit to warm up to, but this is a great disc to own for you big Thievery Corporation fans. Nice compliment to The Richest Man... and it goes cheap. My only complaint is that its too short...works nicely if you are ""out of this world"" however ;).Pick it up while you still can...great remixes by the band themselves."
3,What happened to you Thievery Guys!?,"I'm a great fan from THIEVERY CORPORATION, I have all their albums, and of course this one. I'm very dissapointed because this Babylon Rewound is not what I thought it suppose to be, this tracks are not DUB at all, they sounds more like reggae dancehall, so I don't like reggae dancehall!! I hate it!! here in Panama I'm sick and tired of that stupid kind of music! Maybe 2 or 3 songs are not soo bad at all.But once again this is not a DUB album!! so please if your looking for serious DUB don't buy this album, sorry Thievery guys!(or if you like reggae in general you can purchase anyway!)"
3,Allright Already!!,The book and the stories are well written and informative to a point but they all take place in the northwest. Hypothermia and tidal conditions unique to that area dominate the problems described. After a while the book was repetitive and did not address paddling safety beyond that area. I would love to see some variety replace the repetition - the same research and reporting on problems accross the country and perhaps internationally.
4,Great stories with detailed analysis of what went wrong,"This book is loaded with well told, detailed stories of paddling gone awry. Each story is followed by an instructive analysis of the situation--how the paddlers misjudged the conditions, how they might have avoided equipment failure, what training might have helped the situation, etc. It's all laid out in very practical terms that you could put to use yourself. Amongst the stories are numerous sidebars with more information on techniques and equipment that are also useful, but much drier. My only criticism is that the book has not been updated. Most of the stories are from the mid-eighties and while the principles of kayaking haven't changed, available equipment continues to evolve. In summary, a fun book to read full of useful information for any sea kayaker."
5,Sea Kayaker,Purchased this for my son in law. He really liked it. I think he learned quite a bit from it.
5,"This is a compelling and educational ""must-read""!","I have kayaked for almost twenty years, and I read this book twice and will read it again. When paddling in the ocean or sea or Lake Superior, it is all too easy to ""cut corners"" and this book has served to focus my attention back to the essentials of basic safety. I have lent the book to many experienced paddling friends who are similarly impressed."
5,Better safe...,"This book shows how a number of relatively minor miscalculations can add up to big trouble. Kayaks are little boats in a big sea, and learning to read the ocean, file a float plan, study or take the time to learn about the area tides, currents, etc. is critical, especially when traveling solo. I learned a lot about what NOT to do when kayaking. I have been sea kayaking for a number of years and have recommended this book to many people starting out in the sport."
4,Good book,"I recommend this book to anyone who is active in watersports. It made me aware of the seriousness of some dangers I didn't think much about before (like hypothermia). Some stories have happy endings and some don't. Every story is analyzed to determine what the participants did right and what they might have done differently.My only criticism is that most of the stories are centered around one particular geographical area (Pacific northwest). I wish there were more stories having to do with different conditions (whitewater rivers, flatwater, etc.) and in other parts of the country so that we non-coastal people could relate more. Still, a fine book."
4,A kayaking Essential...,"This book should be included with the purchase of every sea kayak sold.Unfortunately, it seems that because the increasingly popular molded plastic sea kayak is made of the same material as a Frisbee, some people treat it as just a toy...The ocean, however, is NOT a toy. It will provide us with immense enjoyment (fellow Yak junkies will know what I mean) for those who have the proper equipment and skills, but it can be merciless to the careless, and very cruel to the poorly attired.There's an old saying, ""You can play in the ocean. If you play WITH the ocean, it might kill you.This book is about people who played WITH the ocean."
4,A guide of what not to do.,"If you are new to this sport or an experienced paddler, this book can provide valuable insight on how to stay out of trouble and what to do, or not do if you find yourself in trouble."
3,"Good Information, Out of date stories.","The stories in this book had some real value to them and any beginner would see the value in reading about the unfortunate disasters of others. However, I was disappointed that most of the recent events talked about happened between 1984 thru 1994, almost 13-23 years ago. Sea Kayaking has come a long way since then, but none the less, the events the book talks about are important valuable lessons to those beginners just starting out in the sport."
1,one of the worst designed books i have ever tried to read,this book is produced by people who know nothing about books The format is so poorly designed that it is impossible to read. Very dissapointing. Hard to believe this book is distributed.
5,AWESOME book!! Very Informative,I used this book as a part of my study and research for my Yoga Teacher course. It is completely awesome! This book is chock of very useful and informative information!! I passed my Yoga Teacher diploma course with an A+ and I believe that this book had a great deal to do with my achievement!!!
4,Good resource,Structural Yoga Therapy is a guidebook for those interested in yoga. I bought this to help identify exercises to strengthen the back of a teen with scoliosis. The writing and illustrations are clear and easy to follow. I'd recommend it.
4,Great Book,This is a great book for yoga teachers and students. Lots of useful information. Great insight into the mind/body connection. I would definately recommend adding this book to your library if you are a yoga teacher...excellent resource.
4,Good Reference for Yoga Teachers,This book is an excellent reference for yoga teachers. I've used the structural techniques in my classes. Highly recommend it for all teachers.
4,structural yoga therapy,A welcome book that is a great help in spotting common postural misalignments in students. It also outlines the areas of the body that are tight or weak resulting from the misalignment. I like his detailed explaination on the joint opening sequence called pavanmuktasana as this can be a good starting point for students that have body bias or are new to yoga.
3,CHINTZY ADOBE PUBLISHING,"The contents of this book are very valuable. The publishing format of this book hurts the eye of the reader, trying to cope with its ADOBE PRESENTATION."
1,A yoga book without photos is pretty useless,"There are no photos, the illustrations are amateurish, and the descriptions aren't all that great. If you need to adapt your practice, the books to buy are Yoga for Wellness by Gary Kraftsow and Yoga: The Spirit and Practice of Moving into Stillness by Eric Schiffman."
5,A loving memory,Back in the early 90's I was fortunate to be given a copy of this little book by my daughter. AT the time I had an all white cat whose name was Gretchen. When she passed on 3 years ago I found this book among my treasures and filled it in with all my memories and thoughts of a loving companion. Over time I have taken out this book and read what the author had written about the loving relationship between a feline and its owner and along with that I added many of my fond memories. In areas there are places for snapshots which I added from the time she was 5 weeks old to when she passed on at the age of 14 yrs. This little book has helped me to keep the memory of her loving compansionship close to my heart. There are many cat lovers who would cherish owning such a memory book of their little pet. The authors have done an excellent job of making putting into words and pictures just what a pet owner feels for the one who loves them regardless.
2,Seeds don't germinate,"Over the last 3 weeks, I've been checking and rechecking my seeds that I have in the window sill, always making sure they're moist... But not a single seed has sprouted. Not one. They've been sitting for 3 weeks. I bought a different variety of seeds and they sprouted on day 3. I'm not pleased with these. Luckily the seeds are cheap, so it's not a huge loss. Go with the heirloom seed packets. My cherokee purple tomatoes germinated just fine."
3,36TH whaaat,"I ordered 36th Chanmber and Return of the Master Killer. I recieved 2 movies with different covers and write ups thinking it was part one and two but they were both the same movie. nobody can tell me the difference in the title for part one and two. Other than that buy the one from this seller, real good quality vs the other with was horribly boot-legged."
4,They work fine.,"I wasn't thinking when I got these. I just needed something to make $25 for free shipping. If you plan on using the same speaker cable forever, they are great. If you want to make changes in the future, get ones that you can reuse. As this add states, they are crimp on, not reuseable. Every crimp (failed or not) is about $1. These must cost about 2 cents to make. The markup on these things are incredible. It's that way eveywhere for banana connectors now. I may just wait for Walmart to start selling them. They are Sooo much easier to use though! That being said, this sale is about the cheapest with free shipping. 32 connectors shipped for $25 (when I got them). Parts Express is close, but shipping is not free."
4,A good value,"I replaced the ends of all of my speaker cables with these banana plugs. You will need a crimping tool to correctly attach these plugs. If your wire is thin, bend it double before inserting it into plug otherwise it will not hold well."
5,"If you don't groove to this, you just ain't punk baby!","The Big Boys carved out a notch for themselves with their unique style of fun and danceable punk rock. At the same time the music is honest, heartfelt, brutal, uncompromising, and ( I can't stress this enough) genuinely danceable. After reading a lot about praise about the BB from fans, and fellow musicians (Ian from minor threat, Steve from Big Black, Paul from the Butthole Surfers, etc. etc.)I bought both this and Fat Elvis. Fun stuff, with a great attitude. If you're looking for a typical rehash of hardcore you've heard a thousand times before, look somewhere else. If you want something all its own, you have arrived. Just get it.This stuff is essential and will make you wish you could've been there to see them live. RIP Randy"
5,Probably the greatest hardcore band of all time.,The Big Boys are a must for any collector. This is a compilation of their first three releases and is one of my favorite CDs in my collection of about 500. The origional recordings of these three releases are extremely rare and a definite buy if you ever see one in a record store.
4,"overlooked, underrated, eccentric...","i don't consider this band to be hardcore by a longshot, but they are nonetheless great. the big boys and the dicks may well be the two top austin punk bands of all time. the big boys could play fast hardcore ('wise up,' 'security') but they were not afraid to lay down some killer funk ('spit'). they delivered their goods fast and honest. this collection and its counterpart are long overdue."
4,Traditional Martial Arts,"This DVD covers, the asian culture of Japan and talks about the type of martials arts they study. Aikido, Judo, Karate, Kendo, Sumo Wrestling and the ways of the great Samuri Warrior are the topics here. I would have liked to see something on the art Ninjitsu. However, the movie has a very clear picture for being filmed in 1982. I gave it fours stars. I enjoyed this DVD very much."
2,Thomas Spencer Family----AMAZON REPRINT,"This item was a great disappointment. The reproduction was so bad you could barely make out what was there. At least 30% of the words were unreadable! I have to keep it however, as it does give the family tree I was looking for. Doesn't AMAZON have some form of quality control for these reprints?"
3,an ok book,"This is an ok book - it was a bit hard to get into/get through and a bit repetitive. I wish it had more science (written in lay terms) woven in. It was more about driving, spotting a butterfly, driving again to the next spot. (Its more about the journey than about butterflies, they're just the excuse for the drive it seems) Did't really capture me like I hoped it would and I didn't learn much. I was looking for a story more based on the butterfly's experiece and what it goes through than that of the author. Monarchs are actually quite incredible in that its not the same butterfly that makes the whole journey from the east coast all the way to Mexico - it lays eggs and the offspring carry out the journey, knowing which direction to go in innately. Then the process reverses in the spring. I was hoping to learn more about all that in this book but didn't."
5,Lovely book!,What a pleasure it has been to follow these very unique wonderful butterflies on their long journey north then south.
5,MY NEW ALL TIME FAVORITE,"This has got to be the most thought provoking book that I have ever read. I heard the story of how and why it was written, so I gave it a look. Once I started reading, I could not put it down. I own and operate a bookstore and I can tell you that it is flying off of my shelves. I highly recommend this book to everyone that enters my store and I came here to recommend it to you."
4,Excellent for sore horses,I found this book to be excellent for my back sore horse and horses recovering from stall rest. It certainly cannot hurt for horses that you don't want to end up back sore or on stall rest. I have seen major improvements in the suppleness of my horses. The spiral bound format also allows you to keep it set up ringside for quick refrence and it won't close on you unexpectedly!
4,Very good resource,"Not only does this book guide you on stretching your horse, it introduces you to the horses physical makeup in layman terms. It is well-written, thorough & I look forward to using these methods on my thoroughbred."
2,Not what I was expecting,"I am not a horse trainer, but I have have been training my own horses for 20 years. I was hoping for a book with lots of pictures that I could glance at to visually remind me of what each exercise was. But this is not the book for me. It goes through each body part and gives detailed explanation of how muscles work, then active exercises and then goes to Passive exercises. So if you were wanting to passively stretch the whole horse, you have to keep thumbing through the book. The idea of the active riding exercises is great except she doesn't tell you HOW to achieve them. For example she states that riding the horse with the head and neck ""Low and round"" will stretch the topline. That's great, but how do I get the horse to do that. I bought the book because I was having trouble getting this horse to do just that. Overall I have to say I was disappointed."
2,VERY CLEAR AND EASY TO UNDERSTAND.,"ALREADY KNOWN EXERCISES,NOTHING NEW.... ANYWAY A GOOD CONFIRMATION. VERY CLEAR AND EASY TO UNDERSTAND."
4,Awesome fence,"I bought this fence as a replacement for the one found on my old grizzly table saw. The instructions are very easy to follow. I did have to drill 2 new mounting holes in the back of the saw for the rear rail to bolt to. Easy enough. One word of caution, the drill bit and tap that comes with the kit are junk so expect to have your own 5/16 bit w/ a 3/8 tap on hand to mount this unit. Other than that the fence was a breeze to install and set square to the table. When you lock it down it doesn't move and stays very accurate. I gave it 4 out of five stars only because of the inferior tap and drill bit. I would highly recommend this fence to anyone that wishes to bring there old table saw to the next level of accuracy."
4,excellent quality,"Perfs are VERY consistent, both in position and tear-ability. High quality matte stock, but inkjet colors aren't as bright as on gloss stock. Sure wish they made that!"
2,Bad Binding,"I was really excited about getting this collection of stories after reading everything in here online but, once I started reading it the pages started falling out. I think I got to the second story. Very disappointing."
3,great comic,"I love this book, great stories but not as nice as the movies.And the pages are very loose.so have to be very carefull."
4,hit and miss,"This is a collection of stories that are split between mind-shattering entertainment and decrepit dullness. Most of the stories contained are stunning examples of smart science-fiction, but then you get a couple of stories that bring the world of the Matrix to the dumbest levels it has ever produced.Out of the 12 stories presented, 8 of them hold up amazingly well. The best story isn't even a comic. It's an all-text story called ""Goliath"", and (IMO) its the best story Neil Gaiman has done outside of his Sandman epic. I would say it's as good as the 1st Matrix movie. It's probably worth buying the book for.Overall, this book is a lot better than the Animatrix, and just as good as Matrix: Reloaded.writing: [7/10]art: [7.5/10]"
2,uncreative matrix stories,"I picked this up after seeing revolutions, thinking that it might glean more info about Matrix 2 & 3. It doesn't. The stories are pre-reloaded plot twist, and thus dwell on aspects of the first film without really enlarging them. Some of the artwork is good; so not so good (particularly one story ""There are no Flowers""; the scene where the guy starts to fight matrix style is laughable it's so bad, and a devolution of the artistry of the movies). The first story by the wachowski bros. and geof darrow is a re-tread of the one of the animatrix episodes (history of matrix pt.1). I liked the story ""Get It?"" because it was pretty funny. But basically the book doesn't acknowledge any thing beyond Matrix 1 (except there is one story with Link in it). That was disappointing; and most of the stories aren't that interesting."
2,cure for insomnia,"Much like the reader from NYC, when I could stay awake, I often found myself wondering how the writer could possibly relate to the many characters. Far too many twists in the plot to keep up. Save your time and money; there are better ones available."
2,The beginning of the end,"This EP began the decline of Tar. Once the band left Amphetamine Reptile for Touch & Go, it seemed like they lost focus. Gone was the stunning interplay of heavy, repetitive guitars and inventive drumming. Instead, the songs became much more straight-ahead and conventional. Sort of a lighter, more poppish Tar. Perhaps they decided to try to broaden their appeal in the wake of the commercialization of grunge.I recommend seeking out Tar's earlier stuff, especially JACKSON. Clincher just isn't that great, except for the cool pix of the aluminum-clad guitars on the cover."
4,Some of Billy's best early work.,"Turnstiles is a turning point, pardon the possible pun and redundancy, for Billy Joel's music. ""Summer, Highland Falls"" marks an elevation in his lyricism as well as songwriting abilities. ""James"" laments the different courses of life that people pursue while giving us a reminder to ""do what's good for you, or you're not good for anybody."" ""Prelude/Angry Young Man"" hint at Billy's bitterness as well as an insight into a young man's life. One has to wonder how much of Billy's work is auto-biographical.A good album and well worth the investment. It's very important as a transition album as well as for the die-hard Billy collectors, rather similar to Cold Spring Harbor for collection value."
1,Defective,"Product looked very nice out of the bag. However, the fabric flowers were falling off and the headband to which the veil was attached was painted with black paint which not only came off on my hands but on anything it touched! Company DID refund money, but strangely, did not want product returned!"
4,Charming book,"Roderic Jeffries, even in his mid-80's, still busily pens Inspector Alvarez mysteries. I have at least ten of them, but this is the first that I've read. It was a charming experience. Sunny island of Mallorca, filled with obnoxious British ex-pats, makes a perfect place for breezy and light mystery. Inspector Alvarez is a delight. Slightly lazy, ardent lover of brandy, but a snappy solver of puzzles.I am glad that i've purchased quite lot of Mr. Jeffries books through years. It is time to enjoy them."
5,"This is good stuff, kids","There was a time, not that long ago, when this was THE sound of indie rock. Loud and visceral, like a shot straight to the gut. Not just Jesus Lizard, but bands like JSBX, Rodan, June Of 44, and labels like Amphetamine Reptile, Touch and Go, and Quarterstick, put out music that wasn't afraid to rock (and I don't mean the annoying, self-aware ""rock""), and that was frequently ugly, threatening, and noisy. Former hardcore kids who grew into musicians and artists, but didn't forget the sound of their youth, and wanted to take it to the next level; which they did, with urgent, yelped vocals, machine-gun drumming, and propulsive, on-point guitars and bass."
5,Jesus lizard fan,"This is one of my favorite bands. You'll never hear a more tight, fast, hard, frantic, energetic CD than this. Read Yow's lyrics before you listen to it though. This CD's even better when you know what the hell it is he's yelling about."
2,Please enter a title for your review,"from Swans' 1983 debut Filth, through Primus, Glazed Baby and The Ex's 90s material, and currently Loraxx, The Jesus Lizard to my ear fall short of being a major player in the tradition of industrialized post-punk, their abrasiveness blunted by too much old fashioned rock n roll and general garagey sloppiness. if you prefer your staccato brutality with a side of The Rolling Stones and The Sex Pistols then The Jesus Lizard may be just what you're looking for."
1,God awful,"I bought this after seeing Mark Morton of Lamb of God reference these guys and Duane Dennison as worth a listen. What I heard was bad production, shoddy vocals, generic guitar, and overall dullness. Steer clear of this is you like good music."
3,The throwing season,"I rated this book a three cause I really wasn't familiar with the sport. I sort of liked it and sort of didn't like it. I liked it cause it had a lot scenes where there was a lot of competition. I didn't like it cause shot-putting isn't my favorite sport. This book is like a lot of books I read, but the other books I read I was interested in and I would have given them a four or a five. In one of the books I read it was about basketball. It was a story about Earl the ""goat"", and it had the same conflicts and stuff like that. I would have gave it a 5 cause I understand the sport. The Throwing Season was a great book. It helped me understand the sport shot-putting better. That's what I liked about it. The story is good but not that good."
5,unparallelled quality in the area of '50-s/60-s TV series,"The one series that demonstrate a boundary-breaking vision on the design and build of crime-TV-drama. As such an example for all producers who are challenged to innovate.I could not find an aspect I did not appreciate. From the cast to the haunting, unforgettable voice of the narrator it represents stunning quality.I hope all seasons will be re-released"
1,NOT THE 7TH EDITION,"This book is the 6th edition. Go look at the Front cover viewing. Again, this book is the 6th edition! Not the 7th!"
4,A nice companion to the text,This workbook contains exercises that really help to deepen your understanding of the concepts covered in the text. It allows you to personalize what you've read and consider how you would operate as a therapist within the different types of counseling.
4,quality material,"This book met my needs for reviewing indepth material. It is simple, quality, easy to read and understand. This book was worth the buy, and it is the best study guide for the hardcover version. Im glad I got it.V. in Baltimore, MD"
3,Pay attention,"I really meant to order the textbook, not the student manual. For the price, I thought that's what I was getting."
5,Very Helpful,"This was a required text for class. As an old edition I could not buy it at the bookstore and had to order it online. Very happy with this student manual, quizzes on each section are VERY HELPFUL and seem to have prepared me for my first test."
1,still waiting,I purchased this last month and it was the wrong product I requested a return and still havent got an email bk
5,great,great book got to me in perfect condition got to me on time with the right packing thanks for sending it to the right adress on time nd that you for the great book very well done
5,defining an era,if i could take one album that could without a doubt hold the energy and excitment of the disco era it is Sylvesters masterpiece work here.this album not only encapsulates the heart and talent of this late artist but what the era was all about. six stars!!!!!!!This album is iconic.
1,DO NOT BUT FROM THIS COMPANY,I wish I could give negative stars.This company sent the wrong item and did not refund money. They said that if I remove this bad review they will refund. This was 2 months ago. I recomend you go to a reputable NAPA store where if you have any questions or the part does not fit you can get a full refund. In short do not buy from here. It might be cheaper up front but if the part needs to get sent back you will never see a refund. They do not deserve a single star.
2,too simple for 2 1/2 year old,"good pictures and the ""slide out"" feature is entertaining, but my grandson at age 2 1/2 was quickly disinterested - more appropriate for less than two year olds"
2,Pass,We love the SG videos we already have and so I was excited for a new one to add to the collection. Too much focus on interviews and talking and not enough on other things made me turn around and sell it right away. I didn't even make it through the whole thing. Definitely suggest SG Guide to Living before this one.
2,"Nice looking solar lights - unfortunately, they don't work.","The lights look very nice. However, there are some major problems with these solar lights.1. Quality problems. I installed six lights. One didn't light up at all. Two flickered (on and off) and after one week all but one were dead.2. The stakes are very fragile. I broke the first one right out of the box. I was very careful with the others and managed not to break others when I pushed them into the ground.3. These are accent lights - ie. they are visible at nights (1 LED only) but are not bright enough to be used to light up side walk or anything. They also didn't last long. By 8:00PM none were still lighted even when they were working.4. The light is blue, not white."
5,another nolimit re-press,this is not the 1992 original release of E-A-Ski - 1 Step Ahead of Ya'll. This is a 1999 re-press it has the same number of tracks and the tracks are not cut at all. It is a re-press. The album looks like the authentic 1992 release and is for the most part is except for the No Limit catalog number printed on the cd and inserts.
4,NO LIMIT EARLY STUFF,PRETTY GOOD CD FROM EASKI - RAW LYRICS AND BEATS - REMEMBER THIS CD WAS MADE IN 1992.ONLY 9 SONGS.
3,Basic and bland,Caro's book typically gets praised because it is one of the only books on tells. This book is great considering the options but doesn't really help much with actually reading players. A book is really not the medium to communicate this kind of information and you would better off with a video. Caro's video is not the right one.
3,"good for what it does, but...","This is good for what it does -- interpreting the body actions you and others display at the poker table. And some of the stuff is helpful. it will improve your game.But body language is not nearly as important as other things. Like understanding which hands to play, how to put other players on hand ranges, how stack size influences play, and so on.So you are better off reading a bunch of other books first. this might be the 6th or so book i'd recommend reading."
4,Good Book,This was a birthday gift for my husband and he has already read it 3 times. He couldn't put it down for the first read through.
5,"May have a limited life span, but that may be good enough","Okay, here's the facts:Read this book (as everyone else will be doing) and you'll learn something. Then you'll have to contend with the people who've read the book and are using ""fake"" signs and tells, trying to throw people off the reality of their hand. That will work for only so long, of course.So do you feel lucky? For how long? Are you playing against a pro or are you just going for some easy money for a night or two? Whatever your agenda, this book may help. But keep in mind that if YOU are reading it, someone else (maybe a pro) is reading it too. There is a learning curve here, folks...staying ahead of the curve is the real challenge...and no one book will teach you that. But this book will do a great job of keeping you on top of the average game, maybe even the above average game... and it might even speed up your learning curve. Reason enough to buy it."
3,I don't know...,"I didn't really buy into this book, but I guess when it comes to basic tells it does the job. The fact is, I'm not a pro, and just this last weekend I played in a home game. I tried to use Caro's tricks and it was only then that I realized how difficult it is to focus on my own cards and also try to figure out tells. That being said, I definitely started to pick up on a few tells from my opponents. Sadly I ignored them twice and lost big pots, but in the future I will destroy them.Overall a good basic ""tell"" book, better than the new ones anyway, especially Helmuths."
2,Basic Poker Information,"If you are new to poker then this book might be worth the money. Frankly, anyone who has watched TV Poker for more than a year has probably picked up most of this stuff from the commentators. Today everyone is an expert, and lots of the stuff they spout is from Caro's book. So newbies will find it useful, but anyone who has played awhile or watched much TV poker might not get much out of it."
3,Too tell or not too tell !!!,"No doubt that this book is helpful, however, following Caro's thoughts as a presenter/book writer could have been easier, so that each tell would have a more direct impact for the reader rather than more sub divisions which are a result of tells. His genius is beyond most readers!"
5,Powerful book for an intermediate poker player,"excellent book - covers the basics, but is so powerful that a quick browse of two pages before i went to play a cash game earnt me about $400... i wish i had read more, because the very next page would have saved me from making a $100 mistake as well.Powerful book for an intermediate poker player"
2,Not so hot...,"I was kind of dissapointed with this book. Most of these ideas are common sense, and not overly ground breaking. The way the book lays out hands is somewhat tedious."
4,Not bad,"It a little bit on the difficult side as to writing style and very out of date when it came to the pictures and graphics, this book is still a good recommendation to any that play poker (of any kind).Harrington recommends this book, at least exposing yourself to the tells others have or that you may be giving is a good idea. I give it a recommendation."
4,Neat,"I loved it. You get to take a look at undestanding and identifying ""imperfect"" information. Then you can use it as a weapon!"
1,Don't waste your time,"I read this book and there are maybe 2 tells in it that I found usefull. The main problem is that he gives all gerneral tells. Thats all and fine, but in poker you really need to learn the individual tells of the people your playing against. I'm gonna give away the best part of the book. If your opponent seems strong he is really weak and if he seems weak he is really strong."
1,longest two sentence book ever..........,"Let me some up this book for you.......... Strong means weak. Weak means strong.... sometimes. If you have ever played cards before, and you are looking to learn something, anything, or just want to read something interesting... look some place else!"
1,Don't waste your time with this one,Caro provides very useless information about poker tells. He tries to make it seem like a unique style but to the trained eye like me this book is full of nonsense. If you want to read a book that not only discusses poker tells but goes into useful concepts such as hand selections and investments. You need to purchase Issa Jouaneh's thriller No limit texas hold'em tournaments.This book will teach you to play like a professional and also will allow you to showcase these skills on the poker table.
2,worthless,"Recommended to me by a professional poker player in Las Vegas. I don't know what kind of chumps he plays against but my friends exhibit none of the behaviors described in this book. I tried his methods first game after finishing the book, lost my farm. I might have picked up one or two pearls that will help me against a really dumb player, but the clever ones show none of these weaknesses."
1,30 pages bound upside down and backwards,this is an obvious tell. I'd rather not own a book that I have to flip over back and forth to read/reference.returned for refund as replacement is apparently not an option.
5,Caro's Book of Poker Tells,Excellent information. Every serious player should read this before putting their chips in the pot.
3,Caro's Book of Poker Tells,It was a decent book. Not really what I thought would be because it is often the same tells over and voer again but I mean they are decent tells. I would recommend it for the beginner getting into the game but not for an intermediate player looking to up their game.
4,Contrarian Use of the Book,"Read the book and then use it to your advantage. I've tried to consciously deceive my opponents whom I know have read this book. It involves play-acting on my part where I throw out the tell-tale signals, only I have the opposite holding of what I'm telecasting. Trying to watch for other's tells is too much work and unreliable :). Still a good read, though."
3,Poker Tells by Caro,"Not easy to read or understand. Bounces back and forth between different types of poker games. If you play live action with 7 car stud, Hold'em, 5 card draw and omaha this may the book for you. I only play Hold'em and felt the book should have been sectioned off by game."
2,Poker Tells,I wasn't impressed at all. Most people that play already could figure out what he tells you and you have to pay him for it... :-(
4,Great,"Definitely a must have for any serious poker player. Really gets into the psychology of tells and is very interesting. Although I don't like how he tries to quantify the profitability of being able to realize certain tells. Also, the game of poker has changed a lot and a large amount of these tells are known my many experienced poker players."
2,Time Has Passed Caro By,"Much of the material in this book is dated. The concepts are good, but the situations are outdated. For example, there is a lot of focus on observing how people smoke their cigarettes. Since most poker rooms do not allow smoking today, there is little value to that material. Maybe the book can help you to focus on observing your opponents' behaviour."
2,Not much here,"It all boils down to ""strong means weak, and weak means strong"". Lots of photos of people sitting at a poker table, padding the size of the book. The photos look like they came from the 1940's. Betting patterns are much more reliable as tells than whether the guy looks at his chips or not."
4,Gets the topic out there,"While I agree that some of the aspects of being dissociative are exaggerated in this series, there is a great deal of realism as well. I can see how some multiples might find it offensive and how some may find it great to relate to. Certainly, every multiple is different and every internal system is different. I give kudos for getting the topic out there!I wish Amazon had a release date for this."
1,Just Sad,"I really wanted to like the show, the acting is nice, I suppose, but the situation is just too abusive for the children, for me to find it amusing in the least.These things don't usually bother me, but the teen daughter is carrying morning after pills, instead of being on sane birth control, and the parents have little interest in addressing this. Very serious issues are overlooked in the cutsie presentation, and I just could not get past that."
4,Showtime....controversial as ever,"I just saw the preview video on Showtime and found it enjoyable and entertaining. Showtime is known for its controversial and over the top shows with twists. Such as Dexter, Weeds, The L word etc......It's what keeps the audience coming back for more. I don't think that any disrespect was ment torward's the patients and family and friends of the people that suffer with multiple personality disorders. As medical profesional I've seen what the disorder has done to families( it's very sad ) and also have seen some stability when patients stay with their medication.I took the show for what it was....entertaining, a wonderful cast of actors/ characters and I would like to see where they take us down the road and how they handle this as a family. Showtime has a habit of mixing intense situations with humor...so we will see. I think as an audience we should give it a chance."
1,I did not buy this,I did not buy this so i can not review it. Where does it show thaat I paid for this as I did no such thing
3,No contempla Sub títulos en español,"Siendo Costa Rica un país que habla español los Sub títulos deben estar en español, no es Portuguez. Esto impide disfrutar completamente el producto."
3,I ordered Dallas Complete Seasons 1-14 and I did not get 14?,"I ordered Dallas Seasons 1-14 and I received 1-13, plus The Dallas movies (which I had already purchased). So, I have 1-13 (no 14) and two copies of the Dallas movies. Really?????"
1,Whatever,"Dallas is OK, but I much prefer ""Knots Landing"" as a prime time soap! I only own the first/second season of ""Dallas"" and refuse to buy anymore until more seasons of ""Knots"" are released!"
2,MY DALLAS MISTAKE!,"My new husband loves the old Dallas shows, so for his birthday I purchased this collection. Everything started off great until season three, the season would jump, freeze, etc...We had purchased season three again. Everything was going along fine UNTIL season ten---jump, freeze, and then it would turn itself off! We are holding our breath for the rest of the seasons. This was a very expensive mistake. I am very sure a will not make a purchase of this amount for DVDs again on line, unless it's from someplace like Best Buy. (in case you are wondering, we did try the dvds on different players)"
3,Collection is Great..but,"The series is great; however, the discs are very poor. Factory sealed cases when opened have scratches and other defects and while most of the time they can be played--I've had to return the set once already and I haven't even finished season 2. So my advice is to open every package and inspect every disc and if there is a problem send it back. Unfortunately, you have to send back all of them--not just the one season or disc. To Amazon's credit, they do pay for return shipping and the turn around is reasonable."
4,Sentimental Viewer,Enjoyed watching the series from beginning to end. Was dissapointed to find one or two episodes would not play. Overall quality was good. Packaging good.
3,Some helpful tips among many irrelevant ones,"I learned some good tips from this book, but find I wish I had spent my money elsewhere. I look forward to matching the slants of my increases to the slants of my decreases, but do I really need to know 5 different ways to wind a ball of yarn? Or all and sundry's ideas for handy yarn containers (from diaper-wipe canisters to plastic baggies)? This is mostly a compendium of readers' helpful hints, and has no center of gravity to it. I probably won't use 90 percent of it."
2,Redundant if you have other knititng reference books,"The tips and ""trade secrets"" in this book were nothing I had not read before in other basic knitting books. These are tips sent in by readers, so there is a lot of redundancy and lack of flow in the book. And some typos. I guess you get what you pay for. Probably would be good if you are a new knitter and only have $10 or so to spend."
3,Useful info for hand knitters...but,"I was a little disappointed in the fact that I typed in the words ""Machine Knit"" in the search and this is the first book that came up. After receiving the book, most of the information is for hand knitters..the machine knitting information is very limited."
2,not for machine knitters,"This book is really not worth it for machine knitters. (I hand knit, too, and I'm still not convinced it's worth owning a copy!) There are only a few machine knitting tips in the entire book, and most of them are either basics covered in any knitting machine's owner's manual or tips for highly specialized items that wouldn't be useful unless you had the pattern in front of you."
3,"Pretty good, but could be better","I wanted to rate this 3 and a half stars. There could have been more tips for the price, and it did not need the machine knitting section--I'm sure there are enough tips (for machine knitters) out there to make a book on its own merits.The tips that are in it are pretty useful though, so while not a ""buy now"", it is certainly a ""buy later""."
4,Cute Christmas Story,"I enjoyed this cute Christmas miracle story about a lonely 60-yr.-old man who felt he had wasted his life with major screw ups along the way. Christmas time annoys him and he feels like he's hit bottom, but happens to go inside a church and his ""prayer"" reaches heaven. Three angels are assigned his case and with their help, he turns his life around and people he's hurt greatly in the past forgive him. If you like happy endings and a light fun read, this is a book for you."
1,HORRIBLE!,One word says it all. HORRIBLE! I'm shocked that John Goodman would lower himself to be in this film. Times must be tough.
3,V-smile pocket car charger,"Received in a very timely manner, acutally arrived quicker than I expected. Great price. Very pleased. Would purchase from this seller again."
4,Wonderful,It's getting harder to find pure cinnamon oil but thats exactly what I received. No artificial ingredients. Thanks!!!
1,This is not the real thing,"First of all this stuff is Cinnamon Leaf Oil and NOT Cinnamon Bark Oil. Olive nation is misleading people by not making it clear that this is Cinnamon leaf Oil. Even the label on the bottle they sent is different to the one on Amazon. Don't get me wrong,this stuff is Potent and will burn your hands if you are not carefull but it has no smell. And what is point of it if you don't get that classic Cinnamon scent? Only Cinnamon Bark oil will give you that. Compared to Cinnamon Bark Oil you can't smell this stuff. I wanted this stuff for my house, after seing them used in hotel in Sri Lanka (where the best Cinnamon Oil comes from)but I might as well throw it."
5,Great Product,"I bought this for my mother to be able to make her traditional hard tack cinnamon candy. She is in her eighties now and can't really make it, but I was able to go to her house and make it for/with her and it brought back all the memories of childhood with the strong smell of cinnamon throughout the house. My mother reminisces the days when she had to get her cinnamon oil from the pharmacist. :)"
5,Ancient Curative,I had purchased Cinnamon oil in Seattle finding it at Pikes Place Market but had been unable to locate a source in Houston (Saddle and gun oil only). The oil is advertised to be pure and if the product is any measure relative to taste and consistency I would say cudos to the supplier. A drop in my morning coffee makes it a bit more palatable.
5,Be Careful - This stuff is Strong,"This is a great product. We have made several batches of cinnamon candy and all but the first batch was great - the first batch was too hot to eat. Follow the instructions in the recipe and work your way up, slowly, if you like it hot! The cinnamon candy we made tastes great."
2,Not that good.,I must have got a bad batch because it is not hot and has very little flavor. It was nothing like the reviews.
5,Hot Damn,"What a product. I made the mistake of tasting it first. Won't never do that again. I made a Moonshine drink called Apple Pie with it. Wow, what a drink...."
4,My review,I bought this for my nephew. He seems to be happy with the game and played it a number of times.
1,Another Broken Disney Title,"Games from Disney Interactive consistently don't work for me. They run slowly, crash, and freeze."
5,Amazing for the price,I was surprised at how good this speaker was for the price. I actually bought it for a college engineering experiment on speaker responses and break in periods. I was so surprised at how good it sounds i'm actually putting it in a box and considering putting it in one of my systems.
3,"Best section available on ""coping"" strategy","If your repetitive strain situation has gotten to the point where you need primarily information on coping with the pain and inconvenience, possibly from surgery, this book has the best coverages of that aspect, among the 6 books I've read. The non-MD author appears to have written approximately 1/3 of the book from a non-technical viewpoint, describing the life experiences and ideas on coping, down to the most intimate issues. Easily worth the ""price of admission"" for any of the ideas you might pick up."
5,MY FAVORITE MALE GROUP,"THE O JAYS HAVE BEEN MY FAVORITE MALE GROUP FOR A LONG TIME.THE FIRST SONG I REMEMBER BY THEM IS LONELY DRIFTER.I DO NOT REMEMBER THE YEAR IT CAME OUT, BUT I KNEW THEN THE OJAYS WOULD BE AROUND FOR ALONG TIME. THE OJAYS HAVE NOT SANG A SONG YET THAT I DO NOT LIKE.INCLUDING FAMILY REUNION ALBUM."
5,Ojays yes !!!!,"Thsi a classic ojays work, if you want to tap your foot and shake you booty then this dics is for you."
5,Memory grabber,"Love this album,this is really good music or feel good music. Someone in who grew up in the 60's 70's would really enjoy. The time period was when you played out side until dark or the street light came on, all the world was safe."
4,For the John cassavetes fan...,"I am a huge John Cassavetes fan. tempest is one of those movies that will grow on you. It's merely a tribute to Shakespeare's last play, not a literal adaption.Stomu Yamashta's music blew me away. It's a shame he has not scored that many movies. It's a greater shame the soundtrack isn't available on CD, though I have one I transferred from the LP. Great movie and a very reasonable price for this rare video."
5,"Cassavettes & Co. ""Show Us The Magic!""","A brilliant adaptation of Shakespeare's play. The ensemble cast of regulars from the glory days Cassavettes' independent films are well represented - included the ageless Gena Rowlands. Casting Raul Julia as Calibanos was inspired. He creates a hilarious and utterly humane character that is as over-sexed and under-loved as it gets. However, part of director Paul Mazursky's ""magic"" is to blend the ""independents"" with Hollywood. Susan Sarandon and Molly Ringwald round out this pitch perfect ensemble cast. This version of ""The Tempest"" is among the best adaptations of Shakespeare on DVD today. Contrast it with Peter Greenaway's ""Prospero's Books"" to see how versatile this play really is."
5,Just a great movie,"I first saw this movie in the 80's when it came out on VHS. At that time the picture quality was not great but the story was. Good story, good music (sinatra) and beautiful locations. Susan Sarandon was just georgous and even Molly Ringwald was cute. Makes you want to go the Greece and live on an island. The DVD picture makes it even better."
4,ok,"This movie was received very quickly and in perfect condition. I am happy with my purchase. It is a coming of age movie, a little slower than I remembered but a good movie."
3,tempest- 80's flick,"Kind of dry but worth a watch. I remember seeing this movie on HBO back in the day, so I went back for another watch."
4,Playful adaption of Shakespeare,"With all the movies that have come out lately with Shakespearean themes, or that are based on Shakespeares original works, this definitly deserves a look-see. Besides the fact that Cassavetes was one of the greatest film makers of all time (IMHO), there are great performances in this movie from Gena Rowlands and Raul Julia. Even Molly Ringwald manages to be charming somehow.If you like Shakespeare, and if you like film that moves at a careful pace (allowing for real character development) with a wonderfully intellectual script, then you will most certainly enjoy this movie!"
3,Soundtrack Savior,"finally found it. ...calling it the tempest is a little misleading. if you're looking to get out of reading the play, this is definitely not the movie for you. many of the characters aren't even functionally analogous to the ones in the text. this movie is, however, decent in its own right. the final shot is what got me to watch it more than once. mazursky's shot of new york from a helicopter is awesome and i love the dinah washington choice.enjoyjeff"
4,Missing soundtrack,"I have watched this movie a few times in the past, but I can not recall the name of the tune played at the very end of the movie. It is a sunset over the Manhattan skyline and a female jazz singer sings about ""how lovely NY is in July"" or something like that. Does anyone know what I am talking about? Any suggestions will be appreciated!"
1,Cloying,"This has not aged well in its last 25 years. There is no heat whatsoever between the aging John Cassavetes and the young Susan Sarandon. It makes no sense for her instant attraction to him. Likewise, the debut of Molly Ringwald is beyond saccharinely cloying. Bad, bad acting, even if she was only a young teen. Raul Julia saves the day a bit as the wacky goatherd, but it's still a stereotyped role. Not worth the bother, and it's too long, besides."
1,READS LIKE AN AD,This book contains no useful tips for recording and nothing about mixing. Instead it promotes products but gives no detail on how to use them.
4,Informative,"Very informative for those of you who have a well water system, as I do. Easy to understand, at least for me. Covers several subjects on which I was in the dark."
5,A great grill at an affordable price,"I recently purchased the Hamilton Beach 25219 Health Smart and I love it. It is easy to use, and easy to clean. I find this grill just as good as the George Foreman, if not better. We liked ours so much that we purchased one for my daughter & her boyfriend."
5,a great buy,"i love this grill.despite the small size, it works great. its quick & amazing. for 3-4 ppl, the meal can be ready in 10-15 min. & theres not much washing needed. overall, i'm v v happy with this grill so far."
3,HOW STUPID,"IF THE GRILLING SURFACE HAD EVEN 2 SQUARE CORNERS, IT WOULD HOLD 2 STANDARD SLICES OF BREAD SIDE BY SIDE. WITH ROUND CORNERS IT WILL NOT."
5,the TWILIGHT ZONE stories you never got to see,"If you loved THE TWILIGHT ZONE, you will love this book. But - fair warning - this book may make you *hate* THE TWILIGHT ZONE for not having filmed all of these stories and screenplays (most of which author J. Neil Schulman wrote for that series). One - the title-story - eventually made it to production; others got accepted and then ended up suddenly pulled as insufficiently ""politically correct."" So mourn what you have missed - but enjoy what you have. Fans of time-travel paradox will especially enjoy Schulman's ""Figure 8,"" which provides the neatest, strangest, hardest-to-guess-in-advance temporal puzzle-piece since Heinlein's ""All You Zombies."" No - I take that back - ""Figure 8"" actually BEATS ""All You Zombies"" on every count: and I'd never have thought that an inveterate Heinlein-addict like me could say so."
1,A disappointment,"I was very troubled reading this book. The women are very weak characters. Their husband cheats on them and verbally abuses one of the wives. The women are submissive and pathetic. I was so angry, that I couldn't even finish this book. As for the historical fiction aspect of the book, it wasn't anything out of the ordinary. If you are looking for a bible story where women are treated like animals, this is the book for you. If you are looking for a historical perspective on the time period, this is not the right book."
1,STUPID BOOK,Just finished reading this book and it was so stupid. Pure fiction everything from Samuel and his fathers 1st wife love affair. Don't read this book will be very disappointed.
5,The Song of Hannah,"I so enjoyed how the author moved the reader through both Hannah and Pninah. It was so interesting to ""see"" the story from both points of view. What really made me happy was to see the humanness of women of the Bible, as well as their strength of character and their strong sense of survival. They could have been women of our time. I am happy to have this insight presented to me. One certainly would not have to be a ""history buff"" to enjoy this book."
2,Just OK,"It starts out OK -- along the lines of a torrid biblical romance. But once Samuel grows up, the story falls apart. The romance becomes far-fetched and rambling. This book is OK as a time killer -- no worse than a soap opera, and better for you than raiding the cookie jar. But it is eminently forgettable. If you're looking for something substantial or thought- provoking -- this book isn't it."
3,"""Desperate Housewives"" meets the Old Testament","This novel, one of a trilogy written by Etzioni-Halevy about prominent women in the Old Testament, is an enjoyable, easy read. The author, who reportedly wrote these novels after ""rediscovering"" her Judaic heritage, has done a good job of making the often bland ciphers of Biblical accounts come to life. The only problem I have with this book (and the rest of the trilogy) is that it sacrifices a great deal of character development for steamy sex scenes. Of course, many readers won't have a problem with this, but many others buy Biblical or historical fiction to learn more about a character, and get their NC-17 thrills elsewhere. If you're looking for a somewhat jarring blend of history and bamp-chicka-WAH wah, this is your lucky day."
1,The song of Hannah,"I loved most of her books, but this one was little story and much sex. Too much for the subject."
2,Small Comfort for those with Infertility,"Etzioni-Halevy weaves a clever tale based on the Biblical account of Hannah. However, considering that Hannah is one of the primary sources of Biblical comfort for those struggling with infertility, it's disappointing that the author infers that Hannah's barrenness was punishment for her fictional betrayal of Pninah. It's too bad that, in this book, Hannah couldn't just be infertile without it being retribution for her crime. It's a slap in the face for anyone struggling with infertility to suggest that it's their own fault. If you are looking for comfort through the story of Hannah in this book, don't bother."
4,"Bible, sex. love, betrayl, adultery, and history","This was a good book that, for me, started off slow but picked up when the conflicts REALLY kicked in!! Makes me in a strange sort of way, glad to see that these biblical icons had the same problems that I/we have. Samuel was no different and it was nice hearing about him and his mother and his attraction to an ""off-limits"" woman. I will definately be checking out this authors next novel."
4,Great Sleeper Album,"I'm surprised to find this album on Amazon in CD and MP3 format. Deanna was my dental hygienist. She always had great music playing in her work area. She gave me a copy of Simplicity one day. When I listened, I discovered a terrific blend of classical and jazz piano styles. I might compare her playing to George Winston, although I think her style has more in common with jazz and classical than with New Age. I've added many of the songs from this album to my iPod jazz playlists. Some of my favorites are What Would Beethoven Think, Dancing with DaVinci and Nevyn. I should add that these are all original compositions...very talented gal. If you like acoustic piano, you will probably enjoy this album."
2,"Not close, no cigar","A decade ago, these cards might have been o.k. but the newer, cheaper, video capture cards are both better and easier to work with."
3,Challenging and Insightful...,"This type of book requires a sizeable committment of time and thought. Armstrong undertakes an ambitious goal of surveying the origins of religion in different parts of the world that coalesced into the Axial Age.The structure and organization of the book was not always clear or coherent. Much of the advice at the book's close devolve into platitudes. Nevertheles, it is a worthy read for those interested in the historical origins of the major modern religions."
3,Inaccurate,"At least regarding the Jewish components, there were inaccuracies regarding translations of words (such as herem meaning holy war), historical timing (such as saying that the exodus occured 400 years rather than 210 years after enslavement), and some aspects of its description of First Temple period Judaism. These inaccuracies affected my sense of the books credibility as a guide to ""The Great Transformation""."
1,Extremely boring.. I suffered through 3/4 of it before calling it quits...,"I've read many books by Ms. Armstrong and enjoyed them all. However, this one was unbearable. At times it seems as if she were trying too hard to write an historical adventure novel, especially when she endeavors to visualize from a third-person perspective what it must have been like to be present at the start of each of the great ""transformations"". It was like pulling teeth to get through each chapter. I've rarely, if ever, given up on a book that I've invested so heavily in. Reading the unabridged literal translation of the Nag Hammadi Scriptures was more invigorating."
4,A History of God,Karen Armstrong is a remarkable historian whose breath and depth of historical knowledge supplies all serious students of the subject to carefully study her writing. A History of God is one of her more remarkable books covering over 4000 years of religious history of the main religious faiths. In a time when religious understanding appears to be crumbling into the dust of untelligent blabber her work will go far to increase the understanding of religion regardless of the adherent engaging in the study.Also her unbiased study and insights are ripe for an age needing a deeper faith to enrich their lives.
4,A lucid and rousing call for compassion,"This is a lucid and rousing review of the history of the major old world religions by Karen Armstrong. Among the surprises: for half its history, Judaism was not monotheistic. And among the messages: faith is not a prerequisite for religious commitment. The idea of an ""Axial Age"" of spiritual sages is chronological contrivance--the span of time from the ninth century BCE all the way to the seventh century CE is just too long to consider a specific ""age"". One might also argue with her implicit assertion that Buddhists, Jews, Jains, et al. innovated religious compassion, while peoples in the Americas, Africa, Australia did what...nothing? Still, Armstrong makes me want to believe in the necessity of religion in society...almost."
3,"Good, not as intense as i thought.","Not bad, i like it; however, it is kinda expensive.I kinda like the white regular Marvis more."
3,"Good, but not my favorite Marvis flavor","I tried both the original Marvis Toothpaste as well as the Marvis Jasmin Mint Toothpaste and really liked them. The third flavor to try was the Aquatic Mint but I don't think I will buy it again. It is still minty but a tad too sweet for me, without any discernible second flavor (like the Jasmin Mint). It is just sweet mint, and that, for me, is not worth spending this kind of money on it. My favorite remains the Jasmin Mint, followed by the Original Mint..."
4,"Pricey, but GOOD","It's difficult to justify spending twice the price of normaltoothpaste,but when it comes to my teeth, only ""the best""will suffice. This is some really good tasting stuff."
5,Feel like Royalty using this tooth paste imported from Italy,Marvis Jasmin mint tooth paste will give your mouth a light bubbly feel with a flowery taste of Jasmin ..You owe it to yourself to treat yourself to this spectacular product .It comes in a old fashioned metal tube with a purple cap ..The box is a pretty purple and metallic color as well ...take the adventure and splurge ..you will be glad you did ....=0)
5,Delicious toothpaste,"I love this stuff, so I bought a bunch of tubes to give to people for Christmas. They all love it."
5,a delightful luxury,"i didn't know what i was missing until i tried this toothpaste!!it makes all others taste artificial and harsh. it's soft, with a nice fine grit that makes your teeth feel extraordinarily clean. the taste is sweet and it's lightly scented, but without any trace of sugar or that saccharin flavour common to most american toothpastes. this is my beauty find of the year - it is definitely worth trying."
3,Great Taste But Doesn't Feel Super-Clean,"I love the taste of this toothpaste and it's certainly novel, but it doesn't make my teeth feel as clean as more commercial toothpaste. I don't know if I would buy it again, but it was nice to try."
4,Eh,"I could take or leave this toothpaste. I have it in both whitening mint and jasmine mint. I find whitening mint to be a little strong at first, but effective for removing light staining on teeth. Jasmine mint is very nice and light, also somewhat feminine. The reason I didn't give it a 5 star review is one simple fact: my breath smells horrible within an hour or so of using. My husband even told me my breath was bad (he's not one to typically say such things). Not my usual Colgate Total. I may buy the Jasmine again (I just love the taste) and get a tube of Colgate for when I know I will be around somebody."
3,"Decent toothpaste, but nothing special.","From other reviews I was expecting a rush of Altoid like cooling and flavor. Instead, this is a basic peppermint toothpaste with the texture of baking soda toothpaste (not sure if it actually contains baking soda). It reminded me very much of the peppermint Tom's Natural which I can get from Big Lots any day of the week for less than $3 for a full size tube. I bought the travel size as a trial before buying a full size tube. Now I know it's not worth the extra compared to basic Crest Tartar Control (original paste) or Tom's Natural of any variety. ."
1,junk ingredients,There was something about the label/packaging that made me think this was going to be special. It's not. It's like any other grocery store toothpaste and even contains 2 kinds of sodium laurel sulfates and several parabens! Guess they think we don't know better.
2,Nope.,"This album really doesn't work. I've been a life long Babs fan and have most of her records. The gap in my collection is most of her 1970's output. I recently purchased this on amazon because I hadn't heard it in a long while and read some of the positive reviews. So I played it a couple of times and realized it's just as bad as I remember it. For me, the only songs that work are Lazy Afternoon, which is really superb; Moanin' Low is fun, but suffers from a clunky arrangement; and A Child Is Born, which I have always enjoyed.I think that Barbra was in a state of confused musical identity during much of the 1970's and was really grasping at straws for most of the decade. This album suffers from sub-standard material and really crappy arrangements. Why, oh why did she waste her time with Rupert Holmes??????? Most of the album is a throw away, in my opinion. I think that Stoney End and The Way We Were studio album are her two best from that era."
3,Folkie Barbra teams with Rupert Holmes,"Barbra moved very smoothly into the folkie mid-'70's with this spare, intimate album. The title track gives one chills of aural excitement, Stevie Wonder's ""You and I"" is heartbreakingly beautiful, ""By the Way""(co-written by Babs, which is why it pops up on compilations)is dramatic and ironic, and Rupert Holmes' ""Widescreen"" features some incredible lyrics. These folkie tunes don't really partner well with the disco-fied ""Shake Me, Wake Me"" or the Cotton Club-esque ""Moanin' Low"", but it's smartly packaged, not too slick, and produced with great care. It's just a bit bland."
2,Not what I expected,"I ordered the Eureka 3684D online after reading many, many reviews and could not wait to get it. I was very disappointed. It has a vinyl hose and the tools do not swivel, which makes it vey hard on arms and hands to manuever. I returned it and bought a Kenmore Magic Blue, which was comparable in price and superior in quality."
1,Overheats,I had owned a Eureka Mighty Mite for 20 years and used it constantly. It was time to replace it and this seemed like a newer model of the one I had previously. The big problem with this one is that it overheats after no more than 10 minutes of use and then automatically shuts down. This makes it virtual unusable as it barely stays on long enough to vacuum a single room. I now use my Miele upright instead which I recommend over this. Too bad because I really liked my old Eureka.
2,Not that great,"Mostly OK, but dissapointed in the cord. It is a very cheap cord, that gets twisted up real easy, and is not easy to store. If I would have known that they would short change you on the cord, I would not have bought it. And it seemed to lose the good suction it had at first, even before the bag is half full! Wouldn't recommend it, sorry."
4,Must View!,"Lenny is a... man and an absolute rock star. Mark Seligar captures Lenny in a way that makes him compelling and makes you feel like you know him just a little bit. The picture of him and his father and what he says is something that I'll always remember. However, if you are not a die hard Lenny fan you will still enjoy the pictures but you will probably not want to own the book. I loved it and then gave it to a good friend who loved it even more."
3,Great if you are already practicing,"These gathas/short poems are interesting and helpful for those who already practice meditation, but may seem skimpy and repetitive to those not already trying to pursue mindfulness.Don't get this book if you are looking for an introduction to Buddhist thought--get it if you are looking for daily techniques to improve your appreciation of the miracle of daily life."
5,One of my five favorite books,"I have incorperated many of the gathas in this book to my every day activities. My favorite one is the one for brushing your teeth, ""... a flower blooms in the garden of my heart."" Absolutely amazing book, I highly recommend it."
2,TiVi compatibility with Sony A-50 receivers,"This product has great recording properties and is easy to use real time, but trying to connect it to my Sony A-50 Direct TV reveivers proved impossible. We have two receivers lashed together with a modulator to send two sattlite channels to all the TVs in the house. They are located remotely and we use an RF remote to control them. With this lashup the TiVo would not change the channels on the receiver using the TiVo remote.Also, the TiVo remote was IR line-of-sight causing us to run long serial and/or IR lines to from the receivers to the TiVo unit, and we could not get it to change the channels on the receivers. Even when we placed the TiVo unit right next to the receivers we were unable to get it to change the channels.After working in this for almost two straight weeks we gave up and are returning the TiVo to Amazon.com."
1,Piece of worthless junk.........,"I bought my Tivo awhile back and have had nothing but problems with it. I have since switched to Brighthouse and couldn't be more pleased. I get 50 hrs of recording, can record 2 shows while watching another one. No cost for equipment. SERVICE IS SPECTACULAR.With TIVO, service was no existant. I had to buy my own equipment and the reception from the satellite company that was recommended was terrible, especially when it rained.Even worse was the customer service people. These people could have cared less about me.Tivo lost my respect and my business.Jeers to TIVO.Cheers to Brighthouse.Tivo is a piece of worthless junk."
1,Replay TV Better,"There is one reason why Replay TV is better and that is because you can connect to the service via broadband. As the only most sophisticated and tech savy people have broadband, this oversight by TIVO is a real slight to us who have more on the ball than the average dial-up user."
2,Picture Quality worthless on Basic Setting,"I absolutely love the concept, the ease of use, etc. The reason I returned my 40 hr Tivo, was you only get 40 hours of recording space if you record with the ""Basic Quality"" setting, which in my estimation is worthless. If you wish to use the Best quality, it takes your recording capacity to less 20 hrs. And truthfully, the best quality is still less than you'd expect from a digital recording."
2,Would be great if it worked,"I bought the Tivo in November, it worked great until the end of December when it began freezing our TV and eventually just died. Fortunately, we did not purchase the life-time service plan because it would not have been transferred to our replacement Tivo. Also, to exchange the Tivo we were expected ship the defective Tivo back to California (from Boston) at our own expense.If your cable service offers an on-demand option, I highly recommend it above Tivo. The customer service is better, it is more reliable and it does pretty much all the same stuff."
1,Don't do it with Tivo,"The idea is great. The execution from TIVO is just that, an execution. It would have been less painful to be shot quickly than to go through dealing with their ""service"" issues. Dial in and get an ""expected wait time 25 minutes"". Please. Then the pitch about ""if you had gone to our website"". Well I had already. Everyone I spoke with was rude and condescending. This company won't be around long because other companies provide better DVR's and service.The warranty is the next biggest joke. You have to give them either $99 or $149 if your unit breaks, which it did, and they send you a rebuilt with a 30 day warranty. You can't buy a brand new one for $150, that has a warranty, and use your current subscription service.Don't use their product our service. I suggest you use another provider or your cable service."
3,Picture Quality Lower Than Before,"Already the proud owner of 3 TiVo personal vido recorders I was very excited to buy the new Series2. However, I was disappointed in the picture quality. I record at Basic Quality so as to get the most hours of recording time and found that the TiVo Series2 60-hr picture quality was not nearly as good as the previous Philips 60-hr machine. Pixellation was constantly a problem and the overall picture was grainier, so I finally returned the Series2 and bought another Philips. Unfortunately, Philips has discontinued their 60-hr model. If you aren't used to the better quality, or if you record at a higher quality level, you might not notice the difference, but it was very apparent to me. Quite disappointing, since I was expecting a quality improvement in the newer model."
4,Welcome Addition to my Home Theater Setup,"You can get a feel for all of TiVo's positive aspects from numerous other review. I, too, love mine, but there are a couple of shortcomings I wish they'd deal with.First, while the unit isn't loud, it does make a enough noise to where you'd want to put it inside a cabinet. Of course, you can't do that with an IR remote, so I would suggest they make it an RF remote.The other thing I'm not nuts about is the toll call I have to pay every time Tivo updates my listings. Major cities are covered, but that's about it. You'd think the monthly service fee would provide for a toll free call. At least I have the option of buying a wireless USB networking card and having my updates take place over my home network.Overall I'm impressed."
2,Great concept but terrible execution,"I have had my Tivo for about a year and I have had problems with the screen freezing and skipping. I loved it and think the concept is great but only if it would be dependable. If you go to the tivo community website which has a link from tivo.com, you will see that there are hundreds of people with the same problem. I have done the same things that people have suggested; unplug the unit for 2 minutes; replace the disk; I'm now at the point that the new disk worked great for a few months but just got stuck staying at the screen that says ""Tivo starting up"" which makes it unusable."
5,Absolutely Essential!!,"I actually won my TIVO as part of a radio promotion, howvever now after having it for over a year I don't know how I lived without it! It is absolutely essential for anyone who has a life..you will inevitably miss your favorite shows and specials without it. It is easy to use. The remote control is easy to read and use. The menus are easy to use and helpful.Even if you were never able to set a VCR, you could easily use Tivo!I am a very satisfied customer!"
5,I love TiVo!,"If you have doubts about getting a TiVo, find a friend who has one! To use it is to love it. To own one is divine."
3,More money then you think!,"Be sure to understand that not only do you need to buy the TiVo (the player) itself, but you also need to buy the sevice!"
3,Got to find a way to muffle it.,"I have one major problem with the Tivo and one minor complaint. While trying to watch a movie the noise from the box is terrible and the only way to stop it is to unplug it from the wall. Right now I,m building a cabinet to stick it in for a little peace and quiet. My other complaint is that I have to spend time every day erasing programs that I don't want and have no interest in. It's a good product but could be even better if I could turn off the self recording feature and the hard drive when I wanted a nice quiet background. All I want is a little control."
5,Beware---Tivo Addiction,"It sounds ludicrous and insane to say that a piece of electronic equipment can be life-changing. But I'll run that risk and say that TiVo is one of the best inventions of our time!No longer will scheduling and commericals stand in your way---watch only what you want and skip the rest! Plus, just wait until you're using the ""Search"" feature and TiVo finds re-runs of your long-cancelled favorite show playing at 2 am on some obscure channel.Absolutely worth the money. My system is great, I've had no problems, and I don't ever want to give it up."
2,watch out!,"I have had this unit for 4 months and was a little bit worried about buying a 'TIVO' brand unit rather than a name brand. The 90 day labor warranty should have been a tip off. Anyway, here I am, 4 months in, and anything recorded or passed through the recorder has an intense tinny overtone. I verified the problem was coming from the recorder by hooking my TV directly up to my cable box -- the cable box sound is functioning just fine without the TIVO. Although news programs are comprehensible, movies and music are just plain painful to listen to. And now I face a mind boggling customer support experience from a startup company that is clearly not set up to support stereo components in the same way as a name brand. Next time I will buy a Sony; my last Sony DVR is still going strong after 2 years."
2,Unit died after 7 months,"This is not about the Tivo service (which is great by the way). This is about this unit. It worked fine for 7 months but the other night died on me. I've read reports of other units dying on people which was why I didn't buy the life time subscription. I called Tivo and because it's not under waranty I'm going to have to pay $100 + shipping and wait 3 weeks to get a refurbished unit. My suggestion, see if the store your buying it from has an extended warrenty and GET IT. Don't even think twice about it. I now regret not getting mine from where I bought it. I'm very disappointed in Tivo with the quality of this unit. With reading reports that this has happened to other people, I'm pretty disgusted right now."
4,Can't Live Without It!,"Tivo is the greatest thing that has happened since DVD's! Get a season pass to record all of your favorite shows and then you can save them to a tape! Also you can set up a wishlist(e.g. a show with your favorite actor/actress) and it will automatically record it. My only complaint is that you can't change the channel if your recording something, and you can with a simple VCR. But besides that it's great."
1,Very disappointed with Tivo product,"I bought a Tivo a little over 6 months ago. One day it wouldn't power up anymore. It took me two hours before I could got hold of a live person at TIVO. Then they asked me pay $99 for labor plus shipping to get it replaced. I couldn't believe it!!! A penalty for a machine I bought only 6 months ago??? I even talked with their supervisor Kyle about replacing the machine. He said - sorry, I completely understand you, but you have to pay. He said that the parts are free. Then I asked him to send me the parts. He said no and I have to send in my units. So, very disappointing... All I can say is that it is the worst customer service I have ever got.... Just be careful. Maybe buy SONY. They have excellent services. BTW, I don't work for SONY. They just have better customer service. We should reward the companies which care about their cusotmers."
2,Bad Image Quality,"Well, I've gotta say, It wasn't sooo easy to hook up, but it could've been worse. Bottom line: the technology behind this thing is awesome and it's a great entertainmnet tool, but.... the picture quality is noticably hideous-like bad streched VHS tape-complete with static lines and everything! Also, does not record HDTV signals yet with cable, only satelite-great... . that's just great.Needless to say, if you've spent any decent money on a TV with good picture quality, you'll have wasted your money on it if you watch any signal through Tivo. Really bad compression used on the video. Uh yeah..that' seven with the best quality setting they have. Sorry, gotta return it 'til the technology gets better. Then I'll think about it again."
1,This is a total scam... in my opinion.,"Recording feature is disabled after 30 days.Which means they let you record for 30 daysso that you wont be returnig it to the store for a refund.after 30 days the recording feature is goneand they want you to subscribe to a $12.95/month tivo serviceif you want to be able to record again.Its a huge scam, dont waste your money on this product."
1,"Just Terrible, and Frustrating","When I opened the box, the tivo was in perfect condition. Nothing was misplaced, and all pieces were there. As I plugged it into the television everything was hooked up correctly but it never started. Out of 4 hours of fiddling around with cables and such I gave up and took it apart for computer parts. I would not recommend this product to someone who is looking for an actual Tivo recorder. I would recommend it to someone who wants something to smash with a sledgehammer when they're mad that it's broken!"
5,Change your viewing habits for the better,"I always thought that Tivo would be way out of my budget until I talked to a friend of mine who had it. It's actually quite affordable, and totally worth the money. I watch a few shows religiously, so I was always setting my VCR--and that worked okay, but I would always find myself with a couple different tapes, not knowing what show was on which tape. Tivo has completely solved that problem. I set it to tape my shows, and it does, and then instead of piles of mystery tapes, my shows are catalogued on the hard drive, so I just click on the one I want to watch and delete it when I'm done. Or, if it's a must-have episode, I can record it to the VCR. That's why I love my Tivo--but there are a million other great features: season passes, tivo suggestioned viewings, not to mention the ability to fast-forward through commercials and pause live-TV!Yay Tivo!"
4,Great for Dishwasher,Wonderful when wanting to put in the dishwasher and you don't want the brush to come out all freaky!
4,how to... make a video of naked girls with a twist,"Of course, this isn't a 'guide to living'... The Suicide Girls are feeling frisky and want to take their clothes off, but they don't like just doing it like that, it needs a story! So the story is that some of the girls have some important life lessons for you: how to roll a joint, how to kill a vampire, how to get girls skinny dipping in your pool... This overall story is actually ok. What's also nice is the little tattoo-bio (tell us about your tats) from a girl following every life lesson. The only thing that bothered me a little was the talking part. As segue into the next life lesson we see some girls sitting in a kitchen, talking about what we just saw. The acting in this part is so clumsy and awkward, I think the video would've been better without it. But all in all, watching this video is fun, sexy and a great pastime."
4,just the basics please,"I bought this phone with a T-Mobile package and have yet to be disappointed.PROS:-Lightweight-Great blue backlight--extremely bright for that wow factor-Indicator light can change color based on who is calling, very cool-Easy menus-Plenty of options for a grown up that doesn't require all the bells and whistles like the newest pop icon's song for a ringtone...although I'm sure that's available for more money...CONS-Numbers are a little small and tough to dial with fat fingers-Plastic covering for socket where you plug in the charger is really dumb design...about the size of tic-tac and not attached-Battery life is not as long as advertised-Silent mode resets to ring when youmake a call and have to continually reset it to silent modeOverall. I'm happy with the phone and reccomend it to people who want a new phone but don't care about all the doodads that a 15-yr old might want. This is just an early review...feel free to email me later for an update."
3,worth the money,"I never did want to take my time to write a review for anything, but now after I read the comment by Mr. David H. about this phone, I just have to throw out some opinions as well.This phone's setting and navigation system are quite simple to figure out. Here is how you can set or adjust the clock:Menu --> Organizer --> ClockBasically I don't have any problem with this phone, including its ringtones. The reason I give it only 3 stars out of 5 is that although its small size makes it look nice and easy to carry around, all the keys are placed too close to one another, which makes it a bit hard to punch a # while driving. Also, internet capability would be nice to have.I recommend this phone to anyone who just wants a phone that works great, with a reasonable price, and doesn't care much for new technology, i.e. internet capability, bluetooth, and camera."
4,good little phone,"I've hade this phone for 12 months. It is a simple phone that does as good job. It is easy to see and easy to set up. I use its alarm for my backup alarm clock. I get pretty good battery life although I have noticed in the last month or so that it seems to run down faster. It is my primary phone that gets used over 4,000 minutes per month. It has been dropped and banged around quite a bit and still works just fine."
2,terrilbe,i hate this phone you cant get a screensaver or id pics and the ringtones are terrible. even if you download one off the internet. it just sounds annonying.
1,Worst Phone Made,"Do not buy this phone it is a piece of junk. I got horrible signals with it and dropped calls. After I upgraded to a motorola my signals were 50x better. ALso, if you drop this phone a short fall, the battery falls off. Every few weeks the sms number would disappear and i would have to call 611 to put it back in. Constantly the textmessaging and aim would go down and i would not be able to get back on or recieve messages sometimes for two days and when i called tmobile they could not help me. It's worth it to spend more money on a decent phone."
4,Simply Brilliant!,"This is a good little phone. I got it for a penny at Car Toys and everyone in my family has this phone because they love it so much. It has normal cell phone features, a bright backlight, and a service indicator light that can change colors. It may be a simple, inexpensive phone, but it sure works well."
3,"Good deal, good phone","I got this phone for free with my plan, and its a decent phone. The best feature is AIM, which I love, but it's free, so you can't expect any outstanding features. If you're looking for a good deal and don't care about the camera or color screen, this phone is for you. But if you want the features, spend the money on a better one."
1,"If you like to send phones back, buy this","I'm on my THIRD unit of this phone. First phone mic. died after a few months. Second phone had screen freezes. The current unit is holding up so far. We'll see if it makes it to the six month point. Oh, also the ""travel"" charger died within six months. That cost me and extra $25. I can say that T-Mobile did a good job sending replacements. The signal is decent as is battery life. Otherwise it's a waste."
4,It does the job,"I've had my phone for over a year and haven't had any mechanical issues to date. My only complaint would be poor reception in certain areas, but I'm not sure if that can be attributed to the phone or the network.I've been very satisfied with T-Mobile (especially the service!) and I'm very hesitant to try another carrier. If not for the reception, I'd give it a ten. It does all you'd want a basic phone to do!"
4,no fancy gadgets but a great phone.,"glad i got this phone. reception is very good, i've never had to step outside to get a signal. i got my phone and service contract through letstalk.com and they actualy paid me 50 bucks to take the phone (because of the $50 rebate). this phone doesn't have any spiffy features but do you really a color screen and a camera? so i guess this is a phone for us practical types."
3,This record has too much of nothing...,"But, s***, it's the Band and how can I give a legitimate and heartfelt complaint? Actually, this record is a brilliant piece of musical history, and while it isn'r flashy, it is worth a decent listen. Uncle Bob sings, well, like he usually does."
1,I JUST DON'T GET IT!?!,"I consider myself to be both a Dylan fan & a fan of The Band, but I don't see what anybody loves about this ho-hum collection of churned out (it sounds as if they were just killing time or something) dirges. Even Robbie Robertson said this stuff stinks. I agree."
1,Not for me,"I like both The Band and Bob Dylan, but I find this album quite forgettable and grossly overrated. The title is appropriate, both because of the poor sound quality and the fact that none of it was worthy of original publication. There's only one song, Katie's Been Gone, that I care to ever hear again. Maybe there's some historical interest in it, but I think the album is a bore."
2,Dissapointing,"I love Bob Dylan and I Love The Band. I was extremly surprised to hear how poor this colaboration of the two was. With a few exceptions, The only good tracks on this album are already the bonus tracks on the much better Band albums ""THe Band"" and ""Music From Big pink."" If you are considering this album I suggest those albums and then the album dylan did with the Band called ""Planet Waves."" This album is only appropraite for extreme Dylan fans who need this album to fill out their collection. For others I am sorry to say this album doesn't cut it and should never have been released.Hopefully I will save you 20$"
4,"Wake up, Columbia!","If these spooky/goofy/amazing songs ever get properly presented in a form that doesn't insult them on every conceivable level, it will be my favorite album of all time. Until then, I'll give it 4 stars and continue to stick pins in my Columbia voodoo doll...."
4,Not as good as the five disk bootlegged Basement Tapes,"I have the five disk, one hundred or so song Basement Tapes. The quality of the disks are horrible, but, it makes you feel like you are actually there sitting around and watching them jam. The official two disk Basement Tapes are pretty much just a serious/greatest hits version of the time spent in the recording sessions. The two disk Basement Tapes quality is a little too clean. It really takes away from the mood and intention of the recording sessions. On the other hand, it's available anywhere and the five disk version is vary rare. This cd is a must have however. A gem of any Dylan collection."
4,Just plain fun!,"While most will speak volumes on the historical significance of the sessions from which this set is sourced, I will just say that it is a very fun listen. Songs such as ""Odds and Ends,"" ""Yazoo Street Scandal,"" ""Please Mrs. Henry,"" and ""Tiny Montgomery"" just put me in a good mood......this is not to say however that there is no emotion or soul to this album. ""Ain't No More Cane,"" ""Ruben Remus"" and ""Bessie Smith"" are beautiful songs with great melodies.The contents of this album get 5 stars, but one star was taken off for the fact that both discs fit comfortably on to one, with about 3 or 4 minutes to spare. Ah, Columbia will do anything to make an extra buck."
4,The Band and Bob Dylan Great Find and Wonderful Music,"Personally I would have just made one excellent single album; a lot of material and marginal tracks, but the tunes like ""Acapulco"", ""You Ain't Going Nowhere"" and others make it a must listen for any hard core Band or Dylan fan."
2,"Essential Recordings, But this version sucks!","These recordings are essential to any serious music fan (all genres). But please take my advice and DO NOT purchase this ""official"" version. I bought a bootlegged cd with most of this music on it, and fell in love with the songs though the quality was dreadful. So I bought this double cd set and sat down to listen to it--YUCK! All the mastering and cleaning has nearly sucked the life out of old Bobby. What's more, the version of ""Too Much of Nothing"" they've given you here is just plain insipid (as opposed to the more ""Dylan-esque"" version on the bootleg). You need to own these recordings, but you'd be better off going somewhere else to get them. A crackling speaker or a distorted vocal might not sound appealing, but in this case it lends Bob and The Band untold energy and ""excitement""."
1,How anyone in their right mind can compare this to Blonde...,"...on Blonde, I don't know. One is a fully realized landmark album recorded with the best studio talent in Columbia's Nashville division backing a genius songwriter at the height of his career. The other is a collection of half-written joke songs recorded who knows where by a painfully average tour band backing a guy who sounds half drunk and bored. And, as others have pointed out, glomming a bunch of lame Band songs onto this mess is both commercially fraudulent and artistically reprehensible. As a bootleg it was mildly amusing. As a commercial release it's an insult.Don't believe the hype on this one. If you're a Dylan fan, you already know how worthless this stuff is. But if you're just starting to work your way through his albums, save your money here. You aren't going to find a continuation of the '65-'66 albums. What you'll find is the beginning of a long period of serious suckitude only broken in 1975 w/Blood on the Tracks."
4,Inspiring,"I like the spirit behind this zany venture, as Dylan explores his seemingly vast knowledge and appreciation of many styles of American music. I'm not as keen on the Band, who seem a little dull in comparison."
3,Is not an essential recording,"It is good but it is nowhere near as good as his breakthrough albums like Highway 61 Revisited, Bringing it all back home, Blonde on Blonde.I've tried to like this but first of all I don't like The Band that much so that spoils it for me right away because they are very prominent in this album. I just can't get past that. It might be great for some people but not for me."
4,"Cosmic mayhem, brewed in the bowels of a lost America","This set is essential to any comprehensive Dylan collection, (""Tears of Rage"" & ""This Wheel"" are worth the price alone,) but it is of course much more than that. Once you've clued into this fact, read Greil Marcus's book and hunt down the rest of the basement recordings. They'll get their hooks in ya."
4,Eavesdropping on the creative process,"Fascinating double-album of the legendary basement sessions with Dylan and The Band. One has the distinct feeling of eavesdropping on the creative process rather than listening to a fully realised album. Like a master sculptor's workshop - there are plenty of off-cuts ""Please, Mrs Henry"", ""Apple Suckling Tree"", works in progress ""Katie's Been Gone"", ""Goin' to Acapulco"" and the odd fully realised masterpiece ""Tears of Rage"", ""This Wheel's on Fire"".An absolute must have for all fans of Dylan and/or The Band."
3,A Partial Story,Not the Complete Basement Tapes and some Band material that is not from the basement - What for Dylan to release Complete Basement Tapes on his Bootleg series or...
4,Strong but delightful musky scent.,"It's awesome scent, I noticed a lady at work wearing it and I had to have it!I like to put it on when I go to work as well, but it's a little strong so you need one spray of this fragrance."
2,Return product service,"Delivery of my product was prompt,unfortunately it wasn't the product I wanted. I contacted the seller and the next day I had a response, with their apology for my dis-satifation.I received the product return address with a promise of a refund.I packaged the product and shipped it to the return address and waited.I tracked my package and when it was delivered I contacted the company to confirm the return. They asked for the tracking number, I sent it. The same day I received the companies return shipping label I was unaware that it was sent. In their defense I haven't ordered many things online and first time returning.The following day I received an e-mail letting me know I received my refund, and I did. It was a little bit of a wait some due to my response time but this company definitely believes in customers satisfaction."
1,I wish I'd known before I bought this product....,"I wish I'd known before I bought this product that the grinding strainer is now made of plastic. WhenI first bought one of these devices in the early 80s the strainer was made of metal. It would grind up anything. Now it's made of plastic. On the first attempt to grind up 3 oz. of tender roast beef, it failed miserably. It just would not do it, regardless of the amount of pressure applied. The device also leaks out of the bottom."
2,NOT IMPRESSED,"The picture shows a metal strainer (the plate with holes that the food comes up through), but what we got was plastic. It falls short of working well other than for soft foods and I would not advise anyone to order this product unless they can ensure they will get what is pictured! Disappointed!!!"
3,Worth the money,This product worth for the money. But remember it does not do the bullet job. Good for the traveling or where ever you do not have electricity. Whenever you use it you need to separate all the parts and wash well because it has a lots of tiny areas which food remains in them (time consuming for a mom). You only can use soft foods like banana or well cooked fruits and always there is a left over piece which you can not grind it anymore so you need to use certain amount of food not small portion.
2,kidco food mill,Not as good as the 2 that I bought around 8 years ago. It had medal gringers. Also one of the new ones wigles a lot when turning because the treads are to long and does not get tight.
2,would not buy except for travel,"I find this product looks like a toy. It is very light, small and does not look solid. I bought an electric mill after buying this one. I kept the Kidco one for travel."
4,Great product!,"Great product. Easy to use EXCEPT putting the grinding lid on. It's a little bit frustrating to get it in just the right place so it will snap in. Easy to clean, but wish they'd fix that darn top part.Highly recommended! It will grind just about anything (we've tried things like fruit salad to steak to shepherd's pie! Comes out perfect every time!)"
3,Very average...requires a lot of effort,"Given the large number of good reviews, we were quite excited about this. Not very useful and requires a lot of effort - we finally went for an electric one"
2,Cheap and doesn't grind meat.,"If all you want to do is mash up fruits and veggies that have to be so soft that you lose most of their nutrients and would like a cheap piece of plastic with a metal scraper on the top to do that job, then buy this food mill. I'm giving it 2 stars because, honestly, it does that and does it well. But, if you'd like to actually feed your developing infant more than mushy bananas AND spend money on something that won't break in a few months, then spend a little more and buy a real food mill. You can make a variety of baby foods with a variety of textures that will get your child through every stage of feeding, and you can then use it for years and years after to make mashed potatoes, homemade tomato sauce, etc. If you still don't believe me, ask yourself this question... ""Why is this product so cheap when so many others are far more expensive?"""
3,KidCo food mill,"This product is so-so, not for someone who wants to make food in large quantities. Also it doesn't make the food smooth, it has a lot of texture so your baby should be ready for this. I will use it later on when I want to make a small (single serving) of something for my daughter that we are eating ourselves."
3,"good, not great","The first food I wanted to use was broccoli. It would work wonderfully, then seemed to get jammed, work again, etc. It does work, but with more effort than I had expected. I tried preparing the food to be softer, but I encountered the same problems. I tried nectarines another day, and it made it very soupy. I guess I wish there was a way to adjust the mechanism to grind the food to different consistencies. My 9 month old son can handle chunkier foods, but with this mill the food is very liquidy. The size and minimal amount of parts/assembly make it very convenient and very easy to move. Also the entire mill can be cleaned in the dishwasher."
2,Just okay,"This grinder was recommended to me, but I have to say I find it frustrating to use. Juice leaks out the bottom when grinding steamed vegetables or juicy fruit, and grinding some things (e.g., green beans) takes a lot of force. While the price is fine, the high cost of ""shipping and handling"" to purchase one unit made me angry; had I noticed before I bought it, I wouldn't have! Since then I've noticed that this is sold at most local grocery stores."
3,It works,"This food grinder works, but it's hard to get the grinder thing in place in the slots & then hard to get it out once you need to pull it apart."
5,great grinder,"Not fancy, but great when you take infants along to other people's house or out to dinner at a restaurant. Been giving this as gifts for over 30 years."
5,Baby Food Mill,It works great and was shipped in a timely manner. Our baby can now eat all the food we eat and she loves it!
5,AWESOME Baby Food Mill.....makes AMAZING baby food!,"I LOVE this product! I was reluctant to buy one for my first child, but I got one the second time around!!!! I don't know how I survived without it!!!!!! I just put some of MY food in there...at home or at a restaurant....add a LITTLE water to make it the perfect consistancy...and whallah!!!! PERFECT baby food!!!!!!!!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!"
1,Plastic grinder not substantial,"I should have read more reviews, but I was in a hurry and the product description said ""Medical-grade, stainless-steel components"". I had one previously that was stainless. This one is not. The grinder is plastic and would not stand up to grinding anything but soft foods which can be easily mashed without it. The description should be changed to be more accurate. It was returned."
1,Terrible!,"This product was advertised as having a metal grater. However, when I received the product, I found that the grater was actually made of plastic, which made grinding very difficult and even more trouble than it was worth. At times, I felt as though I was using my entire body weight to grind simple foods, such as rice and noodles - even after blending them in my food processor first! In the end, I sent it back. I would highly recommend all interested to avoid this product entirely!"
4,Does its job,This food mill is easy to put together and use. I like that I can grind meat effectively with it. One drawback is that it leaves about 1 cm of food unground at the top (I have a predecessor to this model and there is no space at the top). I have compensated by just placing some bread in the bottom and putting the food I don't want wasted on top. The other minor inconvenience is that to clean it properly you usually have to take it completely apart. The small rubber gasket gets food under it. The handle/grinder part also has some small pieces that can easily get lost down the drain if you're not careful.
1,Iam not happy about the product!!,"I do not like how the product leaves about a 1/2"" of food in container! I will never buy a KidCo Food Mill again!"
2,better than nothing,"If you don't have an immersion blender, or food processor, I guess it's okay. But it's almost easier to just mash food with a fork. Or chew it yourself. It wastes a lot of food in the space between the plunger and the grinder. Also, the grinding bit is NOT SHARP so even with a lot of force applied, you aren't going to be able to grind anything harder than a baked potato. It is a frustrating tool, but it's still a tool, better than nothing."
3,Food mill works for boiled fruits/veggies but not so good for other foods,"This baby food mill is really great if all you want to do is mash up boiled/steamed fruits and veggies. However, if you are interested in processing anything hard, or raw, or with texture like raw melon or meats and other things, it is very difficult to get the food through the mill. The problem is that 1) the cutter has no blade, it's just a blunt metal tab that turns when you turn the handle 2) To get the food to go up through the holes, you have to push down manually while you turn the crank, and for anything harder than a boiled zucchini, this can take a good deal of effort. Still, this is convenient for the things it can do well, it is easy to wash, and you can feed the baby right out of it. I'd say to get a serving of steamed pears onto the table takes all of maybe 6 minutes."
5,Great Time Saver,"I thought my mother-in-law was nuts (and a little old-school) when she gave me this food grinder, but I have used it with three sons, a nephew, and two nieces. The beauty of this grinder is that you can put aside some of dinner, grind it up, add a little liquid when necessary, and feed the baby ""right from the dinner table."" Meat with veggies is a fan favorite. Some things are dry in nature, and thus grind up a little more difficultly, but a little added milk or cereal always works. The grinder always cleans up easily and travels well. I love this product and highly recommend it."
2,Kidco food mill,"I was excited to start making my own baby food. Unfortunately, this did not live up to my expectations. It was hard to take apart to wash (there seems to be no easy way to get the crank out or detach the rubber ring). It's not like I have a whole lot of spare time to waste. It wasn't good for starting solids as it did not fully mash anything but bananas... and really, a fork can do that. I am throwing this away and just using my blender."
2,Difficult to use,"I bought two of these mills to prepare baby food for my daughter. I am very disappointed with them because they require too much strength in order to push and turn at the same time. Some food goes through with ease, but most foods don't. I have found that I would rather use my blender. I am amazed that anyone can put pizza or meat through this thing! I have only tried to put steamed fruits and vegetables through it and have had to work really hard at it. Cranking is easy, the pushing down is difficult."
3,Food mill,this product does what it says and is handy but you have to really push hard on it so the food gets pushed up and so the wheel can grind it. VERY MESSY! I used the storage containers you can buy sepratly more than i used the actual grinder.
3,good buy,I am very glad that I got this mill. It is very convenient for grinding up whatever we might be having for dinner to share with the baby. I only gave it 3 stars as it does nothing that I couldn't accomplish with my blender or food processor. One thing the mill has that those don't have is a better convenience as far as tossing it in the diaper bag to bring along with us wherever we might be going.
2,A lot of work...,"I got this because I remembered my mother having one. It does work, but it was a hastle to clean and didn't grind through things like the one I remembered. I was disappointed."
4,KidCo Food Mill,"Good product except there is a big gap after pushing down to grind food. This gap does not allow you to push it all the way down, therefore not being able to grind all the food. The tube needs to be shorter to allow it to go all the way down onto the food to be ground."
5,Had it for all 6 of my kids and a bunch of grandkids,"We like mealtime to be a family affair from the beginning so we love to sit the baby down and grind up whatever we are eating so they can participate. Great, easy, and wholesome homemade food for you baby!"
4,Magnificent,I think secretly I am still in love with Annette and these episodes help to rekindle memories of a nicer time
4,A little taste of the era,"This collection along with the enclosed notes will help any jazz listener, new or old, to savor a little taste of the era. It may also whet your appetite, as it did mine, for more music from some of the featured artists."
3,Horses!!!,"I read this book when I was a kid amny many years ago. It is a great book but now knowing much more about horses than I did at 12 yrs of age, I see a lot of incorrect information...so whoever else reads the book, remember it is for entertainment ONLY. Don't try to use it as any kind of training. I only gave it 3 stars because of the bad info."
4,Very different and comfortable!,This shoe is great. The colors are really pretty and they get a lot of attention. They do run a little wide.
1,You have to be kidding me!,"Well you would think with a picture of a gun and the description of the advertised item, you would you would recive an Air soft gun, with the starter kit and magazine. I was wrong, and so were many others. I also resived the pellets and not the advertized ""gun."" I am dissipointed in the product, and think that all who orderd the described ""gun"" should be refunded their money for false advertizeing."
4,A goo done to buy,"This soundtrack is pretty great. I'm not the kind of guy who listens to a lot of female singers, but I recommand this cd to everyone who does. The New Order's cover by Orgy is very good, but my fav is the Jennifer Love song How do I deal. What a good song. I LOVE that one."
4,Pretty good CD,I would recommend this CD ... it is worth buying rather than burning. It's a good use for money. I enjoyed most of the songs on the CD and listen to it much.
3,It was alright. there were some good songs and some bad.,there were only 3-4 songs that i really liked. it's a good cd to have and the songs that i liked are very good. i don't wish to list them but i'm sure whoever purchases this cd will be very pleased with it.
1,This CD is terrible!!!,"The rap song makes this CD unbearable. To hear good music, search for the Conan The Barbarian and Conan the Destroyer soundtracks."
4,Good Research,"This book is a good research tool for the Civil War period. In addition to recipes used by the soldiers in the fields, there are snippets of camp life and period songs. There's also a section on how the men passed their free time between soldierly duties. To be honest, my spoiled modern palate can't quite conceive of trying most of the recipes, but the rest of the book is a fun snapshot of life for the soldiers of the North and South."
3,for the buff only,"This really isn't that interesting of a book. It's a collection of Civil War recipes--but nothing you'd want to eat. Really, this is only for the Civil War buff."
2,disappointed,"I ordered this for piano for my 8yr old grandaughter. The book is too ""delux"". Pages are so thick book won't stay open on pianThere are only 5 songs and 3 are repeated twice in different keys. Purchaser should be able to know the table of contents before buying. Pictures are nice but really don't need to have lyrics repeated a third time next to pictures when already in the sheet music. Lots of waste."
2,Too Shallow,"Most of this book is a high level introduction to various Microsoft tools (ACT, perfmon, netmon, IIS sever logs, ASP.NET tracing, SQL Server query analyzer, SQL Server profiler) and a little coverage of Compuware's tools. There are 2 chapters on performance prediction: one covering extrapolation (known as TCA) and one covering modeling (Indy).The problems this book attempts to address are not easy; solving them requires a lot more than a tools overview. The chapter on extrapolation is misleading, implying that you can focus on a single metric, and not explaining prediction involving multiple metrics. The chapter on modeling is very unsatisfactory: they show off this cool looking tool (Indy) but never explain where to get it from."
1,It's not the best,when I saw the controller I thought my son would like it so I bought it for him. I gave it to him and it broke about 3to4 mounths later. we tryed it in both controller ports it still did not work. I took it back to the place we bought it and they said that they can't help us.If you know of any way of helping me please contact me at 1-301-728-3287 thank you
2,IT WAS GOOD FOR 3 DAYS THEN IT BROKE,OK THIS PAD IS MEDIOCORE I HAD IT FOR 3 DAYS THEN IT STARTED ACTING UP AND IT WOULD ONLY WORK IN THE SECOND CONTROLLER PORT TO MAKE SURE IT WASENT MY PS2 I TESTED IT OUT ON MY FRIENDS PS2 AND IT DID THE SAME THING THE REASON IAM GIVING IT 2 STARS INSTED OF 0 IS BECAUSE FOR THE 3 DAYS IT WORKED IT WAS GREAT
3,Form versus Function,"I like this toaster but here's the downside: it's huge, and weighs something like 12lbs; it toasts unevenly, the top being darker than the bottom of the toast, the slots are too narrow for bagels etc; and it doesn't pop up the toast. Here's the upside: it looks GORGEOUS, all gleaming stainless steel; it is a true commercial-grade piece of equipment, designed to toast all day, every day; you can rotate the toast half-way to avoid the unevenness problem; the toast stays warm inside the toaster when done, and as a result is crisper and crunchier.The decider for you is the old form versus function dilemma. If convenience and even toast is more important to you, you're probably wasting your money on this model. If you (like me) enjoy something about the feel and look of commercial grade steel equipment in your kitchen, you may well enjoy this."
4,What's missing?,"I was disappointed when I had to buy this on the secondary market at a premium after speculators snapped up all the available copies. My copy arrived two weeks later, shipped in only a padded bag. Ordinarily, this would be fine, but these DVDs come in a tin container that's easily dented. After viewing the DVD, I am wondering whether I got a pirated copy or not?? Many of the features listed in the product description -- such as Donald in MathMagicLand-- are missing. I wrote to the vendor and never received a reply. Any thoughts???"
1,This is not leak proof,I purchased this for my 8 yr old son to be able to pack him a hot soup or hot chocolate for lunch. I purchased this is August and to didn't use it for the first time until now and it leaked everywhere. If you try to close it tightly not even an adult can unscrew the lid and it still leaks.
3,"Not the greatest, but functional","We purchased 2 of these to take homemade soups and such for lunch to work, and for the most part they work okay. Ours are pretty good at not leaking, but the second time we used them, on one of them the heat loosened the glue that fastens the disk that you grab hold of to unscrew the top. My husband had to get a pair of needle-nose pliers to open his lunch. However, once we fixed it with our own glue, it's worked fine ever since. The other one never did fall apart. They've lived through two years of use."
5,Perfect for 4H candy molds,These are pretty standard light weight candy molds. What we liked about them was that they made great molds for 4H candies that we took to the fair.
4,Fun game for those with nimble fingers,"If your child likes Polly Pockets and Disney Princesses, this is the game for her! It is a fun and easy to play game with no reading required. My 6yo got this game recently and absolutely adores it."
2,Difficult and not durable!,"We bought this game yesterday for our daughter. The dolls are very difficult for her to dress. We have to do it for her. Also, two of the dresses have torn already after playing the game only about 4 times. She loves the game and the princesses, and it does teach memory, but it could be made much better."
2,Crowns and Gowns Game Review,"Twice I gave this board game as a gift this holiday season, and my own 5-year-old daughter received it as a gift. While the idea of the game seems good, there seems to be some misleading print on the box. It indicates that the prinesses will be getting ready to meet Prince Charming at the ball, but there is no Prince Charming included in the game pieces--much to the dismay of my daughter! My biggest complaint about this game, however, is with the gowns and accessories the princesses wear as they move about the board. The straps of the dresses are very thin, and my daughter has broken three of the four gowns. She has also broken two crowns and the strap on one purse. My daughter plays with the rubber Polly Pocket things as well, and she has not torn/ripped any of those items, which makes me think the Crowns and Gowns items aren't made as strongly."
2,"Disappointed, not worth the money","Ugh I was so disappointed with this game. The dresses are impossible to put on, and the sleeves ripped. The dolls were tiny and the stands to hold them flimsy. The actual game play is all right, suitable for a three year old but the set up is a pain. This is worth about half the price of what we actually payed for. I'm very disappointed with Disney for this one."
3,Lots of Pictures,"I read only the part of this book dedicated to Greek coins (my area of interest) and learned much. There are many (black & white) pictures of coins as well as text dedicated to the inscriptions and people/gods found on the coins. However, the amount of information contained barely scratches the surface of the subject matter. I would buy the book again, but will continue to look for another title with more in-depth information."
3,Rust-O-matic shades,"I've had these ""stainless"" ventshades for about 3 months. They are speckled in orange flash rust now.I will need to polish and wax them, which is sort of silly.Obviously the stainless steel alloy used in these shades has low corrosion resistance.The chrome on my jeep is 17 years old, and has no rust whatsoever.So these shades actually need a coat of paint, or should be renamed, with some absurd title like (Rust-O-Matic Ventshades, guaranteed to rust in 3 months, or your money...err nevermind)"
5,"Very high quality, inexpensive frame",I was surprised by the high quality of this frame given the low price. The metal looked great and there were no scratches or other blemishes. The backing was exceptional and made it very easy to put photos in while holding them securely in place once replaced. I'd definitely buy this again.
4,Tri-fold Frame,I had a very hard time finding a tri-fold picture frame. This one is very simple and has a nice silver satin finish. It worked very well for our wedding photos.
5,Works Well Compared to Others on the Market,"We've tried a couple of toilet locks and this one has worked the best so far. It is easy to install and does make the seat sit funny like some others do. It is easy to use as well and stay high above the toilet away from any splashing or other ""unpleasantness"". This has worked very well for us and is well worth the investment to avoid toys, books and all sorts of other things going down the toilet."
1,didn't work with our toilet,"We have a Kohler ""Rialto"" toilet, and the way the toilet is shaped, it was not possible to attach the Kidco toilet lock to it. American Standard has a similar model, with the same problem. Have not found an alternative...."
3,Doesn't fit our toilet,"Seemed to be a good design, but fundamentally flawed -- problem is that it doesn't fit our Kohler toilet. The bolts that hold down the lid are too short to accommodate the plastic plate that holds this thing down. Even if we got longer bolts the base is pretty thick and it would cause the seat to tilt forward quite a bit. We're not using it, which is the ultimate verdict I guess."
2,Yikes!,"Wow...really hate this product. I own a Kohler deep, long (whatever it's called) toilet. Not an uncommon toilet. I needed to buy new bolts for the lid to attach this item. As others have noted, the seat is now at an unsupported angle. Also, it seems like my toddler will hurt himself trying to get it open. The lid can still be opened a good 5 inches. I give it two stars, instead of one, because it may work better on smaller toilets than mine---but I doubt it. This is the second type of toilet lock we have tried with no luck."
2,Keeps the lid down at least,"Not what I was hoping it would be. It works, and the install is easy, but the cheap little set screw they us to lock the arm down striped out right away. Luckily the arm sits in the holder without any problems as of yet. We could always glue it in too.The other annoying thing is the push button to open the toilet. We've seen one without the push button and it worked much better than this one. The lip can still be lifted up enough to drop things in which is bad if that is what you are trying to prevent.We might replace it."
2,Broke our toilet seat,"It installs between the toilet seat and the tank, so the toilet seat is at an angle and eventually breaks. I can't see how this wouldn't break all toilet seats, but maybe some are sturdier than others."
3,less time in the toilet,"I let my two toddlers in the bathroom as soon as my husband put the lock on. They went straight to the toilet and both of them started pulling and yanking as hard as they could at the lid and the lock. Satisfied, I walked out of the room for a minute. When I went back in the bathroom, they had ripped off the entire toilet seat lock and all. We put it back on for another pass. Since it took so much effort to rip off the toilet seat with the lock on, they don't mess with the toilet nearly as much these days. I think they really need to work together to get through the barrier. On another note, the toilet seat doesn't sit on quite right with the lock installed. Sometimes it slips suddenly when I sit down on it. It sits a bit off-center now."
1,plastic components are not strong enough,"We thought this was a neat idea at the store, but were really disappointed after we installed it. The major problem for us was that it really does not hold the seat down with any strength. With the lever tightened down and touching the toilet seat lid, the lid is too easilly lifted against the mechanism. We placed the lock on the toilet and then tried lifting the front of the seat, as a child might. The plastic components at the back of the mechanism bend and twist and allow a gap large enough for a child to be able to place their head through. This kind of defeats the purpose of having a lock. Needless to say we pulled it off right away and have ordered a different kind.Additionally - like others have said, it raises the back of the seat so that it does not sit properly once installed."
2,"Solidly constructed, but useless for safety","After installing this toilet lock as directed, I found that the lid could still be opened wide enough for a young child to put in their head and upper-body. Thus, this 'safety device' could then possibly trap the child by making it difficult to pull themselves back out. I've tried several other toilet locks and have finally realized that they are a waste of time and I will simply rely on tight supervision rather than gimmicks/gadgets that could possibly do more harm than good."
1,THE WORST THING I EVER BOUGHT!!!,"I returned this ASAP! It was AWFUL! It comes with a thick bar that you have to place the toilet seat ON TOP of! This elevates the toilet seat in the back and the only thing the seat is hanging on by is the flimsy plastic hinges of the seat!! I figured out quickly that if you sit down on the seat a few times, it will break off the hinges of your toilet seat and you'll have to buy a new seat! Whoever thought up this STUPID design did not think it through! From other reviews, I see people have already broken some seats. Sent this back and boughtMommy's Helper Toilet Seat Lid-Lokand I like it a lot better than this one!Note: NO toilet seat lock will give you a super tight seal. There's always going to be some inch or so that you will be able to open the seat, but at least your child won't drown -- maybe just some of his toys will!"
4,The Game of Life Sponge Bob,"I don't think the original edition of the Game of Life was meant for grade-school age children. Re-vamping the board with familiar Sponge Bob, Squidward, Mr. Crabs and Patrick makes it an inviting game! Visually, the game board looks great. There are slots on the board to insert the Crusty Crab, The Chum Bucket, Sponge Bob's house, etc. The game is a lot of fun and my kids enjoyed it so much. I even enjoyed playing it with them. My only complaint is with the spinner. It is a great looking two-part spinner but when you spin it you have to hold it down. Otherwise it will come apart and/ or come off the board."
4,This game is for little kids,"We bought the game thinking it would be just like the real life game, but with sponge Bob characters. It is a very simplified version of the game. It is geared towards young children. In the game, if you run out of money, you just keep playing, and you are exempt from having to pay any fees, while the people with money, still keep paying...so you are actually better off if you lose your money early in the game. (that bugs me)as far as the spinner goes...it snaps on, you have to press hard to get it to click into place, and it works great. Just a little disappointed, just remember, it's for little kids. If you love the game of life, get the original one...my older kids want me to buy the original one, they don't care for the sponge bob version."
5,great for kids,"as much as i liked the game of life as a kid, the modern version has gotten way too complicated. my kids don't enjoy it at all.This however, being geared for little ones is wonderful. my 7 year old just loves it. she loves SpongeBob, so it's really tickling to be able to extend his life with the game. and although her reading is shaky, this doens't require much skill, but it motivates her to figure the words out. if played with a grown up kids don't have to read at all.great concepts"
4,Very gifted band,"This album features some of the most intelligent and witty lyrics that you'll find in any record. The gloomy tone is extremely easy to relate to and very relaxing. Yet, the melodies lack much variation and get a little drawn out at times. Still a definite ""must-have"" for the rare poetic songs and deepness."
5,Don't You Know That God Stays Up All Night.,"Not sure that YOU have the capacity to like The Silver Jews? Here is what you do:You go and download the song ""Dallas"" from wherever it is the kids these days get their tunes, and then you listen to it over and over again in your car until you understand what's so sweet about it. That's it. That's what you do. Why, you ask? Here's a good reason why:The Silver Jews, like so many other good bands, take a lot of time to really get/understand. So go, right now, and learn to be intimate (ooh la la) friends and/or lovers with a few of their songs. You'll get it. I believe in ye."
2,Warning: Not for all moms,"This book had some practical ideas that aren't very new. Such as having a schedule and such. But I had a hard time, as I was reading the book, believing that her ideas on a schedule were realistic with nursing babies and homeschooling. Certain personality types will struggle with this book, others will probably love it. I didn't feel very encouraged or excited or motivated by reading this book. I suppose it just wasn't written for my personality. I learned alot more and felt more encouraged by other books such as MOTH (Managers of their home) and Emily Barnes books. Good luck!"
2,There's a reason why mother's don't have rules--it's called life with children!,"This book is very unrealistic--both in its suggestions to mothers and to fathers! It has some good points--make time for yourself, your kids, and your husband & do things for love of God. BUT it is written for only one kind of personality/spirituality and wd not be realistic for anyone with a pregnancy, a nursing baby (she gives a bottle) or any kind of chronic illness. That covers a LOT of women!If you think it would be helpful or realistic to try to impose uptight military discipline on yourself and your household, then borrow this book from a friend and see what you think. But if you want some down to earth advice on how to get organized, look elsewhere."
5,Worth Reading (Again and Again!),"I received this book as a Christmas gift from my husband. I was so excited when I began reading it. I am going to be a mother soon (in May) and I really want to be a ""super mom"". This book explains how to organize time for faith, family, household chores, etc. I took out a notebook and started taking notes as soon as I started reading. I know that this book will become a tool for years to come - I am just getting started with motherhood and I have years to come! I will probably keep it on my bedside table, so that at the end of a hectic day, I can skim through and pick out a few pointers!"
2,Not A Woman To Admire,"As it came highly recommended, I read this book...mostly. I gave up after she was posessed by demons. I couldn't take her seriously a moment longer. Not that I'd much liked her before that point. I found her to be very selfish. She considers her kids a burden and must escape them on a weekly basis. If you want an excellent book about family scheduling for homeschoolers, one that considers children a gift and homeschooling a joyful responsibility, look at Managers of Their Homes instead. You'll find it at titus2 dot com, or you can do an internet search for it."
5,Very helpful,"I found this book to be very realistic, very personal. She has given me, if nothing else, a foundation for how to view my vocation as wife and mother, and most of all, child of God. ""Deliberate, Catholic living"" is another way to describe what she explains in this book. I highly recommend it, whether you are considering marriage, are newly wed, or have been married for some time."
3,Some good ideas but it left me cold,"I bought this book for a Catholic book club and enjoyed some of it. I can't really relate to the author in a lot of ways, so that dampened my enthusiasm early on. My chief ambition in life was to be a wife (to the right man) and mommy, and when I became Catholic, that goal was modified to Catholic wife and mother. I know our family life needs more structure than it currently has, but this book just hasn't helped with that as much as I'd hoped. I gave it three stars because it does have some good ideas, and it may all be my fault that it just didn't work for me."
4,Good ideas for organizing busy moms,"I am protestant and this book is really geared a little more for those of the Catholic faith, but the ideas in it are very helpful. I gleaned several to put into practice in my daily life."
5,Fun in the car for the entire family,We recently purchased Rubberneckers for our spring break vacation with the kids. This is a great way to spend travel time in the car with family or friends.
1,Rubber Neckers game,I returned this. My grand-daughter is nearly 14 and was not interested in using it when we traveled last summer.
4,Good for long trips,We found the game to be alot of fun. One caution however -- it does not scale down to the lower age children. I recommend for kids from 10 to 99!
5,Fun Fun Fun,Great game to pass the time while in the car. It not only keeps the kid(s) entertained....it works on us old and boring adults too. Bought this ...for a 14 hour trip and we had so much fun. Just made that same trip again over Easter week and had another great time with the game.
5,It should be reprinted!,I had this book as a child and had forgotten about it until this past Christmas. Went looking for it as a gift this Christmas only to find it was only published one time in 1948. I think it is a gem because of the awe of the animals and the noncommercialism it affords the season.
2,"Good gloves, but....","The glove fit great, but, there is one small problem...they seem to have a dye on the inside...my hands get stained blue...being the gloves are made in China who knows what chemicals could be in the dye. If anyone has had a similar problem feel free to respond with a solution."
1,Horrible,"I bought this thinking that since it was a good outdoor brand, it would be reliable. On the first use, tons of nonstick coating came off, ruining our scrambled eggs, and leaving us without breakfast and without a frying pan in the middle of the woods!"
3,camping fry pan,I liked it for its size and portability but while cooking with it one time the teflon coating is not that durable for that kind of cooking. I wouldn't purchase this again probably.
5,How would you remaster this?,"This has got to be in my top 5 Dylan cds. A classic and if you don't own it, don't wait another minute. I do not pretend to understand remastering...only to know that when music is remastered well I can easily hear it. BUT the premise being (please correct me if I'm wrong) that the music needs to be recorded well in the first place for remastering to have any marginal effect. I'd like to read other reviews before I buy this for the fourth or fifth time."
4,What a team,"Great music, excellent sound, Dylan and the Band were a great team, so easy to listen to and enjoy. Question is why on earth didn't Columbia put the whole lot on one CD - it would have fitted - so that we could hear the whole session more conveniently, rather than reproduce the original 2LP format? Lose one star for that."
1,Why not include the Best Song from these Sessions?,"This release was a bad project in 1975, 8 years after the songs were recorded. If SONY cannot include the masterpiece of the basement tapes, ""I Shall Be Released"" in this remaster, they should not have done it at all. This is insane. The two CDs could easily have include 40 songs from the sessions. Take out the Band-only songs and this CD pair is less than half of what it should have been"
2,Not Very Good,I was expecting some sort of magic here instead it sounds like an amateur band rehearsing in an old barn. Songs and playing are just not very good. You can skip this one.
3,maybe bigger is a little better,"The small size of the phone is convenient, and so far the key pad and display size have not hindered my use of the phone. However, the reception is not very good, in part due to the high degree of background noise through the phone and especially through the ear bud. Perhaps reception issues are due also to the small antenna, but that's just my guess. If you're in the market for a cheap, small, flip phone and are willing to upgrade your ear bud, then this phone should do the trick."
1,"Bad reception, breaks easily","I got this phone in August 2002. I had not had a cell phone for about 2 years. T-Mobile had just launched into Nevada & California. I used this phone from August 2002 - November 2003. I had to get it replaced by T-Mobile 4 or 5 times, which was fine because it was under warranty. The reception of this phone was never very good but I didn't know that as I hadn't ever used a GSM phone before. I finally replaced it in November 2003 with the Samsung E-105. What a different it has made. I have not lost service once in the city like I used to all the time on the V66.I have a family member who also got this phone in January 2003. The phone never worked inside her house. She recently got the Nokia 3595. It actually works at her house! It works really well in fact.I recommend everyone stay away from this phone!"
1,It's small...,"While I don't live in NYC, I do live in a town with 250,000 people that is clearly covered by T-Mobile's coverage area map. I can't reliably use this telephone in my neighborhood (inside the city). It is embarrassing to get an important call and not get enough reception to have an intelligible conversation. I have talked to T-Mobile, who says, ""Sorry, we don't make the phones."" They are willing to give me $50 off a new phone, but that's off the list price (which nobody pays). The phone is small, but that's about all I can say for it. Wait until the rebate pays you $200 to take it, so you can use the money to terminate your T-Mobile contract."
5,Small but Mighty,"I love this phone. Its very compact and easily fits in your pocket, purse or briefcase. It has all of the functions and clairty of the bigger heavier phones, but in a smaller package. I loved this phone so much, I ordered another for my daughter. My only regret is that the display isn't color. I'm sure if you buy this phone you will be surprising pleased."
5,How the phone turns out,"I use to have a Motorola C332 it was a great phone but if you took off the case you would notice how small it was, it was almost as big as my hand. The v66 is less than my hand its soo tiny, i think its great even though some people say the the menu buttons are small. The phone has a status light on the top and can have a changeable antenna. The format of the phone is the same as the c332 but its a flip, changeable antenna, status light and different games the games that it has are:Black JackMindblasterPaddleballThe battery is so small yet the lenght of standby is over 48 houres.This phone is a great phone and CHEEP. If i was you i would go for it.P.S. Never think about getting the c332 it has a built-in antenna but there isnt really one. I find that the worst thing about it is the top of the phone there is a cover for your SIM card and it falls off every time you drop it.Created By Warren F."
3,Small Phone with Features,"We have two of these phones. The volume is best if you put the tip of the phone into your ear. It feels a bit funny at first.It works worldwide, which is handy. We took one to Mexico so people could reach us for emergencies.You *cannot* download ringtones to it.The biggest gripe is the SIM card cover. We bought a decorative cover so we could tell the two apart. The original fits loosely at best and it won't stay on at all after you remove and replace it once or twice."
2,Don't buy it,"I have T-Mobile and got this phone becuase I had previous luck with Motorola flip phones. The first V66 I got would turn off in the middle of a call, even with a strong signal and full battery (not a dropped call or lost signal, it would actually power off and on again without anyone or thing touching the power button). After T-Mobile replaced it, the second V66 was 10 times worse - it shut off during during every call at least once, for no descernable reason - not battery, not SIM card, not signal or usage - it happened in many different places and times and even happened to my husband when he used it. No explanation has ever been given to me for this problem, but I can't wait to get a new phone, and NOT a V66!"
2,Small and light and good standby - but don't get it!!!,"I got this phone as a replacement for the 3 motorola c332 phones I had problems with. It gets a little better reception and battery life and is smaller, but I can not hear the ring sounds unless it is out of it's holster or out of my pocket. The buttons are small and touchy.It is feature packed though - for an older phone!!I do not get near the range of my wifes Sumsung e105 or my old nokia, and I can not use it in my work environment without standing next to a window. My wife gave it to me as she could never hear people on the phone - the speaker is positioned lower than was comfortable for her to hold.If I had my choice, it would be replaced already!!"
2,Bought V66 with T-mobile,"Not worth the money. I got this phone after some problems with my Nokia 3595. Despite my troubles with the Nokia I would gladly trade the V66 for the Nokia. The V66 has much too small of a keypad, bad sim card cover, and a bad screen cover. I have had nothing but troubles with this phone, and would go use a large brick like non-flip phone that gets much better reception and wont break for cheaper than this new phone."
5,"Comact, Long Battery life and very easy to use","This is nice little toy and very easy to use. It is not a expensite state of the art technology. My phone dropped atleat 30 times on the floor/road, but still works great(yah..there were some scratches because it was dropped).I love this phone. I got new T610 phoen, but still love to use this phone."
4,"Made for talking, not much else","Pretty good, some may find very avearage. Not too many features. T-Mobile won't let you download MegaTones or Games. Can't Play Polyphonic sounds. Looks great on the outside. One can buy a silver case and will even look neater. No external LCD. THE KEYBOARD IS NOT HARD TO USE!! very easy don't even have to push hard on the keys. The antennae is a little annoying, especially when in a pocket. Light-weight. OK display, only 1 backlight. So, if u want a phone just to talk on, this is the phone, and T-Moble will have plans to suit your basic needs. If you are looking for a phone to show off with, than this isnt for you. The T-Moble service upstate isn't the best but it works. This phone suits my needs, thats why i gave it 4 stars."
5,Huge Bang for the Buck,"I've owned this phone now for 3 months. I have it because my Sprint PCS plan offered horrible service - specifically, I could never hold a signal and in the middle of a sentence my wife would be saying, ""hello...honey, are you there?"" So I picked up a T-mobile plan and this phone had it all...price (they gave me $50 to have it via a mail-in rebate, and a free car charger to boot), size (it's tiny and super light!) and it's a flip phone which I like because it protects the keys and screen. It even came with a compact plug-in charger as well. And my reception and battery life have been impressive. No, it doesn't have the camera, the color screen, etc. But those phones cost more. And for my needs, those features are neat toys, but not things I anticipate I'd ever need or use."
2,Motorola V66 Flip Phone - Please Read!,"I OWN THIS PHONE FOR MANY MONTHS. IF YOU RESIDE IN A BIG, CONGESTED CITY LIKE NEW YORK(EXAMPLE), DONT BUY THIS MODEL. I HAVE SPENT MORE TIME REDIALING FOR DROPPED CALLS IN MY LOCAL AREA, THAN ACTUAL TALK TIME. IF YOU WANT TO USE THIS PHONE OUTDOORS, YOU WILL HAVE MORE SUCCESS. I PURCHASED THIS MODEL FOR INDOOR AND OUTDOOR USE AS MOST PEOPLE DO. I FINALLY PURCHASED A NOKIA WHICH IS WORKING JUST FINE."
3,from my experience with it,"pretty good source of information. It misses some of the beauty of what the country offers: the food, the arts, the beaches, traditions, etc... Other sources that can help paint a more nicer picture of Vietnam: Vietnam by Olivia Skelton or Vietnam by Audrey Seah"
1,The semester will end and I haven't got my book yet and yet they charged me for shipment,The semester will end and I haven't gotten my book yet and yet they charged me for shipment too. I hope when it comes it will have the CD Rom they promised to have. Otherwise it's going to be a real waste of time and money and I will have to claim my money back
2,Look around for Better,"I am fairly disappointed with Ulead's DVD MovieFactory. There are several glaring problems that I have encountered that Ulead's support team has been unable to help me correct. First is the inablity of the software to burn to my Pioneer DVR-A03. It just won't do it and Ulead support is unable to help me with this. Second the software bogs down terribly when working with 1+ hour videos making it nearly inpossible to set in and out points accurately (I am on a P4 1.8 Ghz with 1 Gig of memory, and Seagate Barracudas in a RAID 0 configuration). However, MovieFactory is simplistic and fairly straight forward to use. I also have tried using MyDVD and it is not very intuitive and it is cumbersome to use. I would suggest investigating alternative solutions like Dazzle's DVD Complete."
5,5 stars for basic video editing and manipulation,"While I have a couple of the expensive packages, I always use this one to first bring in my video or MPEG files. The editor is easy to use, and I can move an hour, minute, second, or frame at a time. I can make quick work of archiving old TV shows minus the commericials by marking the segments and converting. Export is easy and fast. It's strength is file handling.Basic menus on the final products are also available here. But they are basic, compared to the expensive packages."
1,more bugs than an ant farm,"Earlier I posted a positive review of this product, despite the bugs I listed. That was before I discovered that through competitive software I didn't have to struggle with frequent crashes, malfunctioning thumbnails windows, and atrocius splicing, joining, and re-rendering. Unanswered e-mails (outside of ""It's been 30 days. We give up. Reinstall and enjoy the continued lack of performance."" A webboard that could only be clunkier if it was in braille. All this and unimaginative menus, too. I suppose I was just happy to successfully burn a disc.Worst of all, using the built-in capture I could only get 360x240 resolution, which guarantees VHS quality video at best. My ATI AiW 7500's accompanying capture program gets me 720x480 with no dropped frames.There's no perfect dvd-authoring software yet, granted, but this one is bottom-rung."
3,"Decent features, poor video quality","MovieFactory is strong on features. Menus created with it look great, and its thumbnail selection feature is ideal. The only downside feature-wise is that you have to manually add chapter points while actually watching the video (can't just fast forward on the timline to where you want to add them).This said, the MAJOR downside to MovieFactory is the video quality of the resulting DVD. I have a good system and a popular DVD drive, and other software produces great results on DVD's. But Moviefactory produced very blocky video--full of obvious artifacting. And the worst part was, the video would completely pixellate every 15 seconds or so.It's a real shame too. The features are pretty decent. But without features AND decent video quality, the software is pretty much worthless to me."
1,Beware of installing!,"This software is defective and has serious compatibility issues. I was able to create a functional SVCD, but it was very distorted, even though I used the standard resolution for my movie. Installing the product ""hosed"" up my hard drive so badly that I had to restore the system. Stupidly, I tried it on another OS with the same results. I ended up having to restore that machine as well. Both machines more than met the recommended requirements on the DVD MovieFactory box. This is very disappointing software."
1,Does not work!,"Save your money....this product is full of bugs and glitches. I encountered one problem after another attempting to get it installed and running on my fairly new loaded Dell PC (Pent IV, 356 memory, Windows ME, GeForce2 Ultra, CD-RW drive, & 40G HD with room to spare).Repeated email correspondence got the program running on my PC, but it is a confusing and glitchy program. After struggling with it for a week, I was still unable to produce a single functioning SDVD of home movies from my new digital camcorder.In the end, I returned to Amazon.com for refund."
4,Very good basic editor,"This is a very good basic editor for video files. I started using it for editing MPEG-1, but have graduated to MPEG-2. It does basic menus, no more than this, but for most of my projects, that's sufficient. As a plus, it gives me a lot of flexibility when encoding files, and this so far is about the only software package that I can control the encode rate.The only problem I have is I can't burn DVD+R disks (using Philips DVDRW228) that will be recognized by regular players. But, if I burn to DVD+RW, then do a copy with this software to DVD+R, everything works just fine."
2,Can't create DVDs over 4GB,"I spent days trying to find why my program was crashing while creating a Image file to burn on DVD. I tried almost all available upgrades for Windows XP Professional, DirectX, etc, etc but this thing kept crashing. Finally, I found that it can't create files over 4GB on FAT32 disk drive. Which means that all blank DVDs you buy will have to have almost 0.5 GB wasted if you have to use this software.Another major drawback I saw with this otherwise very friendly interface is, it creates TITLES and not CHAPTERS for each file you add to the list of video files to make DVD. The drawback with this is if you select a chapter from menu, it plays only that chapter and comes back to the parent menu. This gets really annoying and I am currently so frustrated that I am already looking to replace this [money ammount] software for which I fortunately paid only [money ammount] due to some rebates and coupons..."
5,gotta have,My daughter kept getting into her closet and making a mess. Was afraid of her knocking door off track too. This is a simple design that works great. Was afraid that it would fall off easy but it is stuck to door and works great. Would highly recommend.
2,Just okay,"I am not too thrilled with this. The first one my husband put on, but it didn't stick right or something. I made the kids leave the doors alone for a day, and then the next day I tested it. With the slightest pressure, it popped off, and took the paint off my door with it. The second one has stayed in place so far, but I haven't dared test it, and I don't know if my kids have either. It may be working, but it just might be it hasn't been touched."
3,There just aren't very many options for locking sliding doors,"Of the options available, this is a decent one, however, you need to make sure that you install these above any panel designs in the door so that it does not get caught in the grooves of the panel and get stuck. You also need to accept the fact that the back of the adjacent door will get some wear and tear from the lock rubbing against the surface."
4,Works well for toddlers,"These have worked well to keep our twin toddlers from opening the sliding closet doors. Our childcare provider, on the other hand, has broken two of them because she forces the doors without thinking about pushing the wings in. Fortunately, they still work with only one wing! For those who have bad reviews, I wonder if the wings were on backward. Notice the direction of the straight vs angled sides. Also, I'd suggest using a better adhesive for longevity. We'd buy again; in fact, we have already."
3,"Great, but...","These are perfect for our mirror closet sliders, but they break so easily--be sure to buy them by the dozen!"
4,security,"Me siento muy tranquila de usar este elemento, ahora mi hija no puede abrir la ventana aún si llegue a alcanzar la perilla.El sistema de subir y bajar es un poco forzado y me parece que terminará rompiéndose si hago muchos accionamientos."
1,Did not meet expectations,"When we first applied the lock to our pantry doors we were thrilled! No more having to worry about every can of soup being taken out of the closet! They worked great for a while (4 weeks or so) then it just didn't keep the door shut anymore. I don't know if the door moved slightly or if the lock flattened out, but it was just a useless piece of plastic stuck to the door. When we removed the lock it of course took paint with it, which was annoying, but expected."
3,Good enough,The sticky back didn't stick to my wooden closet doors. So I had to to screw them into the doors. They work great now though. I don't know what you do if you had to use them on a glass door. Maybe they would stick better to glass though
2,puzzled,im still trying to figure out how to use this product...im keeping it because im sure someday someone will know what to do
1,Total Piece of Junk!,"This did not do a thing and we followed directions step by step. My 29 month old son had it open in no time and it popped the adhesive off while taking the paint off the door with it! Now I have to have the door sanded and painted which is costing way more than the locks. I took them back to the store that I purchased them at, but I still have to pay to have the doors to be repaired. Now that leaves me wondering if all of the Kidco items I have installed with adhesives will cost me a fortune in future door repairs. Anyone else had this problem?"
1,this safety lock doesn't work,This lock does not work at all.My 22 month old daughter still got into the closet.She pulls the door out and slides it open.I think the wings on the lock should come out a few more inches so she wouldn't be able to pull it out and slide it open.I wouldn't purchase it or waste my money.
1,Do I have to give it a star?...,"Terrible, Terrible, Terrible.The first one broke within 5 uses; the second one lasted about 15 uses.There have got to be better ones out there."
1,Breaks with the slightest push,"My two year old simply slid open his closet like normal and both ""wings"" snapped right off, allowing him access. Waste of $."
2,They break,"After a month or so of use, the daily use caused the plastic to snap and the lock had to be thrown out. This happened to several of them."
4,Works for a while,"Here's the deal. If a kid wants in somewhere bad enough and has enough time to work on it, they will overcome safety features. I put this on my toddlers closet door to keep her out. After about 6 months or so she learned to push all her weight on the one side and then pull the other side toward herself. The glue did it's job! the lock stayed in place, but one of the ""wings"" cracked. It still does the job, but she now has it figured out. This is not really a flaw in the product, my toddler just has a way of sticking with something..."
1,Not a good product,It is like unnecessary stuff on my door as it does not work at all. The door simply glides over it. It does not hinder the door being opened.
4,Good product,"We actually got this so that our cat would stop opening our closet doors, and it does the trick. However, I think our doors have a bigger gap than what is ideal, because it doesn't take much force to open them without pushing in the tabs on the lock."
1,worthless,"I was looking for something to keep the children out of the closets in their rooms for now, but my 7 month old pushed on the door once and this lock popped right off. It also took a bit of the paint with it. I would not waste your money on these."
3,OK...but,I thought this was going to be a life saver since my 2 y.o. cant stay out of her closet. It worked the first day until she figured out how to pull her closet door out enough to slide past the lock. I am now looking for a metal closet door holderwhich srews into carpet that wont bend enough for her to pull door out and around lock. If i can figure this out I would give it 5 stars.
3,Doesn't Last,"We got these for our sliding closet doors. Our daughter was able to eventually open the door hard enough that the adhesive came off. As long as your child doesn't try to use extreme force to open the door, they should work pretty well."
1,Do Not Risk The Safety of Your Children,"I bought this product to keep my cats out of the closets. She had it open in under 3 minutes. This is a 10 lb cat. What if it had been a toddler? Don't risk the safety of your children. It is a good idea, but poorly made."
2,Seemed like a good idea.,"I have been searching for a way to keep my 3-year-old out of her closet, and so I was thrilled when I found this product. However, it won't stay on the door. First I tried the original sticker-thing that came with it. No luck. Then I tried gorilla glue. Both the ""lock"" and the paint came off the closet door. My husband says he will try drilling a hole in it and attaching it to the door with a screw.IF you can get it to stay on the door, it works great. However, good luck getting it to stay!"
4,Measure carefully!,"We have had these locks for over a year, and it is just now wearing out. If you have more than a 1/2 inch gap in between your closet doors, these may not work for you. We have vinyl-over-wood (so it looks like fake wood) closet doors and it sticks great, be sure to clean the area thoroughly like the instructions say, and our adhesive worked well. But my son never forcefully tried to open the door, he tried a couple of times, and gave up. We are only now having to replace it because the plastic wing has broken off, but it's after over a year of heavy use! I'm willing to pay $3 more bucks for that long of wear!"
2,"cheap, but works?","this product IS cheap, but it works for now. really, we have no other options that i can find, so i am stuck with this- until it breaks. one thing i really suggest doing is measuring the distance between doors. i didn't think there was much of a gap between the doors, but there is. i had to very carefully bend the flaps up a little more so it would catch on the door. once my kids see that if i pull out on the door a little to open it, this will be useless. i am just counting the days until that happens or it breaks. though, i would buy this again because I HAVE NO OTHER OPTIONS! lol!"
4,Works great,"This item works great, but we had to use a stronger adhesive to keep it attached to the door. Used them years ago with our first child. Was happy to see them still being made."
1,"will only work if you have doors that ""kiss"" like the picture!","My doors have a frame around them so the ""wings"" don't stand out far enough to do any good ...at all. As they are glass doors, I wasn't concerned about adhesives. If you have wood, I think the adhesive would ruin the finish."
2,"Crap, crap and more crap","I should have believed all the other reviews. Broke off the first time Grandma tried to open the closet and didnt' realize we had a lock on it. If Grandma can break it off, pretty sure it wouldn't have been long before the 3 year old could have done it. Don't waste your money."
4,great 80s music,"i bought this cd for my partner and have to admit ,i really find myself listening to it more than he does, i really love heart and soul ,its a great beautiful love song. never get tired of listening to it."
5,To be Or NOt to be,"This was a gift for my son and he loves it! He has even read to be from it. If it were mine, I would comment on the small print because it is harder to read when you get up in age :)"
2,Not What I Expected,"It's my fault. I should have read the product description more closely. Specifically the dimensions of the book. I was looking for and expecting (especially given the price) a nice sized 'coffee-table' type book with big, pretty pictures and interesting text. Instead, I got a small paperback, mostly illustrated with thumbnail sized photos and the occassional full page (but still small) picture.As a practical-travel book it also fails in its mission. Minimal info on sites, hotels or restaurants.The free brochures I got from the Manitoba tourist board are both more useful and more attractive."
4,Rev,"Great book, very relevant to the project i was working on. I recieved it promptly and it was in great condition."
5,Excellent,"This cd is Lore's newest Cd. I bought, and It is great. I really like it when artists put out a cd of their live tours. Lorie is a great singer, and I really enjoy listening to her. If you like Lorie then you should buy this cd. Lorie is on of my favorite singers. I also like the way she did Toute Seule, a new different version. Great Cd Lore!"
1,You get what you pay for.,"The stitching in this jacket is honestly saying...lousy.It is sewn in wrong places,that make its apperance horrible.After removing the new plastic wrap I attempted to button the buttons on the collar,and they broke off.It's a cheap jacket and you get what you pay for. F-"""
1,The Orphan Trains,"This is an educational introductory pamphlet - not a book. I was very disappointed expecting a book with detailed personal stories and instead received a thin pamphlet with very little info. A swipe at the surface of this very interesting bit of American history at best .I would not tell anyone to purchasing this, and am sorry I did. Very misleading."
4,Four for Who's Afraid of Beowulf...,"Who's Afraid of Beowulf is the second novel contained in this omnibus, and the volume is worth buying for it alone. Personally, I thought Expecting Someone Taller was only ok: shortly before reading I encountered Anna Russell's take on the Ring Cycle, and so my enjoyment largely came from comparing the two different takes on the same over-the-top opera. In contrast, however, I really found Who's Afraid to be funny on its own. The Vikings are especially entertaining, as is the way they absorb the modern-day characters into their number. The entire series of circumstances is ridiculous, but the delivery is such that you're willing to follow along anyway. (Or perhaps that was just me.)Basically... if you're a fan of the way Terry Pratchett's dwarves behave, you'll enjoy Who's Afraid as the Vikings are much the same sort of fellows."
4,Nice omnibus,"In case it's not clear from the title, this book is a combination edition of two of Tom Holt's best novels - ""Expecting Someone Taller"", and ""Who's Afraid of Beowulf"". Both are excellent."
4,Slight disappointment,"Overall, I thought this book was well written and was incredibly informative. My only disappointment came at the lack of real hardship they faced on their trek. Walking from Kilimanjaro to the Indian Ocean is no small feat, but I was disappointed that they had all their camps sights (tents, food, etc.) prepared for them by one of the travelers employees. I would have liked to see them carry their own gear and prepare their own meals like true explorers. Besides the dangers from lions, elephants, crocodiles there was never any excitement/anticipation that they may get lost, run low on food, face unknown challenges....it was too much of a planned straight forward trip.That said, the author did a great job telling personal stories of those that established the national park and background info. I'd recommend this to anyone wanting to know more about conservation in Africa...not so much to anyone wanting a true adventure book."
5,"A thoughtful, wonderfully written page turner.",The best book I've read on Africa since Isak Dinesen (Out of Africa)
1,Ethnocentric and quite boring,"I was so disappointed by this book I could not get through more than a couple of chapters. The author may know about mountaineering, but he seems to know very little about Kenya. Moreover, I found the writing to be ethnocentric and quite boring."
3,ok,This DVD was good but about the same quality as what you can find online for free at the various online sites that sell beads and beading equipment.
3,Street Kings,"This movie adaptation of the Elmore Leonard novel by the same name is one of the best Keanu Reeves vehicles out there. It is a gritty crime drama with enough twists which will leave you wondering when the good commander, played by Forrest Whitaker, will finally step in and protect Reeves from those sworn to both uphold the law and to kill him.The uniforms are perfectly done, it's filmed in LA, and features a cameo by Daryl Gates, as the enigmatic ""chief""."
3,Warning Special Features listed on back are absent.,"I was surprised to see this DVD on the shelf at best buy, so I looked at the back of the Bluray, 2 disc edition and single disc edition. All three listed the same special features except the single disc which didn't have the digital copy. I don't care about having a digital copy so I bought the single disc edition. After watching the movie I wanted to watch some of the special features, all I found was the audio commentary and trailers for other movies. None of the others features listed on the back of the case on are on the dvd."
2,Training Day II,"They could have simply called this Training Day II because there really wasn't any ""fresh"" ground covered in this film that Training Day didn't already cover in that film. I mean crooked cops, a ""special unit"" that is ran by a higher-up that is into murder and drug dealing, etc. The role played by Keanu is slightly different than the role that was played in Training Day, but not enough to warrant anything special with this film.And the story was so very predictable. I won't give away the plot, nor do I need to, if your IQ is over 85 you should be able to pick up on it quite easily - they certainly make it transparent enough!Okay so the acting was decent, and there were some action scenes here and there but again, it's all so very predictable. Cops shooting it out with other cops. *Yawn* Seen this many times before!"
3,Missing Special Features,"I was excited about this movie, because Ayer had written two of my favorite movies Dark Blue and Training Day. I wasn't disappointed in the movie.However, you should note that although the box lists the following special features: Audio commentary with Ayer; Street Rules: Rolling with Ayer and Fitzsimmons; La Bete Noir: Writing Street Kings; Street Cred; Deleted scenes with optional commentary; Alternate takes; vignettes; and Behind the Scenes Clips, the only Special Feature is the audio commentary. The other features although listed (per Fox who I emailed about this) are only on the Special Edition version. The packaging of the disks would lead a consumer to believe that the only additional feature on the Special Edition is a digital copy. As most of you know, once a DVD is opened it cannot be returned. So BOO on fox for the bait and switch on what is otherwise a worthwhile product."
3,A fun ride,"Street kings will not get any points for originality...as this is what it is lacking in most, but solid performances by the cast and some really good editing accompanied by a solid soundtrack make this one possible for repeat viewing."
5,Exelent movie.!!!,This movie is really good. I add to my blu-ray collection because is one of the movies than you want to see it again and of course in great definition like 1080p and the best sound Dta HD.
3,"Great movie, dumb double cd","The movie is awesome but the double cd, one blue ray the other digital version, wasnt what I thought it was. I thought that I would be able to play both on my dvd player in my car but was unable to do so because it doesnt recognize blue ray or the digital cd. I thought that the digital cd would be readable on any device, but that is not the case, just a pc will play it."
3,Cle Sloan and Keanu Reeves in the same room an hour into the movie.,Neither Common nor the movie delivered the desired sinister and palpable menace of Training Day. I tuned in to see Cle Sloan because Bastards at the Party was so worthwhile otherwise I would never watch a movie where Keanu Reeves plays a purported tough guy. There are some things Keanu Reeves can't do.
2,Everything about this movie is so over-exaggerating that it's unbelievable.,"Everything about this movie is so over-exaggerating that it's unbelievable. For example in the first scene when Keanu Reeves, as an udercover detective tried to sell guns to Korean gang members. He talked to them in a provoking manner. That's not true in reality. He's supposed to make them to trust him not to hate him in the meeting.Another thing is he killed all the dirty cops around him, I mean everybody. That won't happen in real life.The action is non-stop but that does not save the film."
1,Don't Even Bother,"This movie was so supremely disappointing. It was a convoluted mess. Keanu Reeves should stick to roles where he's not required to talk. When he opens his mouth his words sound like they were pre-recorded in a dark black hole. Stupid dialog, an unbelievable plot, contrived antagonism, and some of the worst acting I've seen since Arnold Schwarzenegger polluted the screen. These men are not ""Street Kings"" they are ""Street Trash."" Bad cops killing bad cops and the worst of the bad cops growing a conscience as he hunts down his own bad cop buddies. Stupid, stupid, stupid."
5,Vintage Instrumentals,I did not know if was possible for older music to come in CD form. The product was great and the timing perfect. The person I got it for is already playing it in her car everywhere she goes.
3,"Street Kings, so-so","Predictable plot, a little overacting here and there. Not too bad. If you're into shooting you'll notice that Keanu's character has had a little training. I liked it overall."
4,Nice movie...,This is the movie that i will recommend people who like simple action movie.The picture and sound quality of the bluray version is superb!!!
3,Slow Hand beats Seduce Me,"Author Michele Slung's ""SLOW HAND-- Women Writing Erotica"" 1992 was vastly superior to her 2004 ""SEDUCE ME--Twelve Erotic Tales,"" even though both are short stories edited by Ms. Slung."
2,An OK book that is out of date.,"This was an OK book in it's time, but it is now completely out of date. This book covers InstallShield 5, which is not supported on Windows ME, Windows 2000, or Windows XP. Both InstallShild 6 and InstallShield Windows Installer Edition are different enought from InstallShield 5 to make this book obsolete."
3,Out of date,"Overall, the book is good. Better than the IS docs anyhow.Bear in mind that the book is written for Version 5.1 and below.InstallShield made a major switch to an event-driven installation and script model in Version 6.1 So a lot of the examples are out of date and need to be converted.I found this confusing as I was trying to learn and port to the new version at the same time."
3,Great for someone creating their first Install program,"I started to do an Install with Installshield that required many custom dialogs and custom features. I got all my information from newsgroups and installshield documentation. I then ordered this book 2 weeks into my development expecting it to answer some of my more difficult questions. It didn't. But, If you are just starting this book should save you some time understanding everything about a basic setup program."
2,"Thin content, cryptic index.",There is very little in this book that isn't also in the manual or in the on-line help. It never gets very deep. If you try to find information in it the index is of little use as it almost only lists InstallScript commands.
2,Not as expected,The sound came out very bad. People cannot hear you very well. I have returned this product.
2,Very Limited Range,"I'm not really picky about a little static, or other features. I just wanted a headset that I could use for hands-free cellphone calls. This headset worked OK when I had my phone in my hand near my chest, but as soon as I put it in my front pants pocket, the headset cut out. The only way I could get it to work reliably was to hold my phone in my hand and around my chest area or higher. If you have a shirt pocket, that's fine. But if not, don't expect to put your phone in your pocket and have it work with this headset. PS: I'm 5'11"", not 30' tall."
3,"Cheap, easy to use, and good if you don't want to talk to anybody","No problem setting the unit up with my Moto phone. But nobody could hear me when I used the headset. Maybe I'm expecting too much, since this is my first try at a Bluetooth headset, but IMO it's useless."
2,You Get What You Paid For,"The sound coming from the earpiece is adequate, however it does not pick up sound so well using the built in wireless microphone. If I used handsfree more frequently, I would definitely buy a higher quality device."
2,Very Bad,"Poor Audio Quality, often i experience noise, [[ASIN:B000GUDPDI Soyo FreeStyler 500 Bluetooth Headset]the voice is not clear and not audible, not user friendly"
2,not so great,"I purchased this as the item of the day to have a second bluetooth headset for my work cell phone. I presently have a motorola 800 bluetooth which I love, thought the soyo would save me from switching that one back and forth between phones and also thought the pocket clip feature would be good. I was wrong. The soyo has a blinking blue light--it doesn't blink just once now and then, it blinks 3 times every 10 seconds. I don't like that and neither do my patients. It also has a hard ear piece that really hurts my ear after a short period of time. The buds that come with it are ill-fitting and don't stay on. When using the pocket clip feature the person I'm talking to can't understand me well. All in all, a purchase I wish I hadn't made. Thank goodness I only wasted $10."
1,Big Disappointment,I'm very disappointed with this headset. Lots of buzzing and very distracting to the person I'm calling. Will be returning it.
3,"Usable, but not good","The price is good, but it's not good to use.1. The voice quality isn't good, there were a lot of noises-ear phone using in-ear headset. but the quality is good if using ""clip""/""wired"" part.2. It's very often disconnected by my cell phone if it's not in use for a while. I had no such problem using my previous bluetooth headset. But it's easy and fast to re-connect it.Comparing with its price, it's just acceptable."
2,"Maybe yes, maybe no","I have a 3 and 4 year old and this device did little to deter or prevent them from raiding the fridge while their mom and I were asleep. A couple of good, hard yanks by your child and this device fails. This might me a good product for infants and toddlers, but if your child is over 2 years old, try something else like the Lock Release Fridge Latch by Safety 1st (but be aware that even though these are by far superior, you'll still have to place about 3 of these Safety 1st latches on your fridge door to keep the little ones from defeating them. That's what worked for us anyway. I'll be so glad when they grow out of this fridge fascination.)"
1,Piece of junk,"The instructions for installing this device are terrible. The way it is supposed to ""lock"" is simply by creating frictional pressure that is orthogonal to the direcitoning of opening the fridge. After I installed it, i found that the level arm bent easily, yielding no ""lock"" whatsoever. Also, note that if you fridge door is not flush with the body of the fridge, then the lever and catch won't line up properly. Do not buy this product!"
2,"It is very lame, but I must admit it does work.","This thing seems to be working fairly well (through 2 weeks). However, I was surprised how rudimentary the thing works. It takes very careful mounting in order to function. I am surprised that I didn't have to redo mine after I mounted it the first time."
2,Didn't hold up to my 2 1/2 year old,"It took my 2 1/2 year old son appproximately 5 minutes to rip this thing off my refridgerator. The idea is simple and seems like it should work. However, the type of glue that is used does not stand up to a child with any determination."
4,Capresso coffee maker,This is a very good product that also looks great. We have had no problems at all with it!
4,Wild Swans Against the Sun,"This album has MMM in all his glory has a songwriter and singer. The album has heart and depth.This album may not be on any bestseller list but if you are an MMM fan; or a folk, country or someone who appreciates lyrics...this rates. The title song Wild Swans Against the Sun could only have been written by someone who has seen, watched swans. With music and words MMM created for the listener the flapping of the wings, he captured their beauty and grace in song. I am also a John Denver fan. Mansion on the Hill in its simplicity, the unplugged, comlimentary voices of MMM and John Denver gives the song heart and soul. Willie Nelson on Rhythm of the Road has spirit. MMM is country singer, a Western man, a cowboy, and a songwriter....original, always.Wild Swans Against the Sun is original too."
3,"""Swans,"" a mixed bag effort.","""Swan's Against the Sun,"" Murphey's follow-up to his breakthrough ""Blue Sky/Night Thunder,"" is a real hit and miss effort. Murphey's songs seem to have worked best in his 1970's efforts when he was singing songs of the old and new West. The tracks ""Buffalo Gun,"" ""Temple of the Sun,"" ""Wild West Show,"" and ""Dancing in the Meadow"" are all a must for Murphey fans. Also, the spirited, banjo driven ""Rhythm of the Road"" (a duet with Willie Nelson) is a quality effort.This album suffers from the same problem as all Murphey's non-western releases; they are inconsistent. The thing with Murphey is the good stuff always carries the day. That is why I am ordering ""Swans"" today to replace my worn out LP."
2,Not One Of Michael's Best,"This was an album from Michael in the mid 70's. The album before this, Blue Sky/Night Thunder is better-maybe 3 stars but this album failed to produce anything memorable but albums following this one has shown where Michael's strong point lies-in traditional cowboy country music where he excels above the rest. Only if you are an avid 3M fan buy this album otherwise steer clear and get one of his albums from the 80's such as River Of Time or Land Of Enchantment. Enjoy."
3,nice smell but not super good quality,This has a nice smell but is not as good of quality as NOW FOODS brand. I'm bipolar and NOW FOODS brand lavender oil in the bath helps when I'm manic. This brand doesn't help as much. But it smells better. I guess I'll go back to now foods.
2,A dry first look at dinosaurs,"This book was not nearly as entertaining as some of the other ""idiot's guides"" that I have read in the past. The book described many of the species of dinosaur, but illustrations were few and far between. Further, the information was presented in a rather dry manner, compared to some of the other books in this line. I also noticed several typos, which took away from the legitimacy of the book. There is some good information in the book, but I feel it could have been presented in more entertaining fashion."
5,concise,This is a book that I purchased for a morality course. This spells out precisely what the Catholic Church teaches about medical issues for not only anyone who is employed in a Catholic health facility but for anyone who needs to know about issues. Most medical issues are noted with references to the various documents.It is challenging reading (not so much of ability) but of true reflection of decisions that may be made in various situations.
4,Every human life is sacred.,"Well organizied, concise and clear, this book speaks volumes about the fundamental issue in today's medical dilemmas. Author covers most medical controversies."
3,Thick but not deep...,"I saw this book at the library and checked it out to read. The book has a lot of chapters and topics, but doesn't go into much depth in most areas. For example, the chapter on Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is 5 pages total. That includes some broad statements about how scanners do OCR, but no discussion of how to improve the processing, specific OCR software, etc.The author seems to own PhotoSuite software (or it came with her scanner) since most examples of graphics software are presented with this package. No help with PaintShopPro, Photoshop, etc. if those are what you use.This book may be useful to home users of scanners to add graphics to documents, retouch photos, etc. but this is NOT the book for people doing serious scanning applications. It is a misleading title that states ""How to Do Everything""."
4,For the Open-Minded,"If you want to hear something very original you can't go wrong with this new opus from Ulver. Mostly based on electronics soundscape, this album will defy the conventionnal sense of song structure building. One song will sound more jazzy, the other one in the ambient category and there are even in some classical stuff thrown in for your listening pleasure. Singer Garm always had a very clear and emotionnal voice and it strangely fits in all parts of those weird song structures. Production wise it is excellent even with all those layers of sound. A must listen if you search for some Avant-Garde music"
2,Rarely red,"2 1/2Appreciate the effort to re-steer somewhere less obvious, but the end result falls between a contrived electronic experiment that smacks of too much trying and something you teeter along with wanting to quit but given enough interest to press forward."
1,BULLVER,"Wow... I don't think I've ever heard stuff that's so stupid. Do these guys even know how to spell?!? Let alone RECORD and MAKE MUSIC. This isn't music. BULLver are just a bunch of homosexuals who think they can make ""complex"" music by playing random notes and saying its art. They should call it ""Jazz"" so that i know to stay away from it. What ever happened to the good Ulver? Their first album and their third album were good. Then that retard Dickster G decided to turn gay and make stupid music. I've had enough of this bull. Check out the first Emperor album and the first 2 Dimmu Borgir albums and the first Old Man's Child album and a couple Dark Throne albums and the FIRST Cradle of FIlth album and any Dark Funeral album for good music. Death to False Music like this. The Beast has spoken.- Angel Beast"
2,"The story behind this book, well known in English History: hanky-panky.","John Dee, the man who invented the phrase 'The British Empire' had a pretty wife who was much younger than he.A much younger man, whose name I forget, helped him to write these books, then told him that the spirits-whom he had consulted- were suggesting that it would be a good idea if he slept with Dee's wife.Dee was taken in, and the man had his evil way with her.You should not take Dee's books unduly seriously.They are a con on many levels.Dee, after all, aimed to gain money and influence through them, as much as his helper planned to sleep with his wife.)"
5,Finally !!!,"""The Scarecrow of Romney Marsh"" was my all-time favorite Disney serialized story (3 weekly episodes) from the classic TV show - ""The Wonderful World of Color"", which aired on Sunday evenings on NBC back in the 1960's. It has been many years since it was last shown on television, and even more years since it has been available for purchase on VHS tape. I have been waiting for a number of my favorite shows from the 1960's and early 1970's to become available on DVD; and many others have become available over the past few years - except this one ! Now that it will finally be available in a couple of months, I certainly will be ordering a copy."
5,Time Travel IS possible,"Suddenly, thanks to this fabulous Disney release, I'm a boy again back in the early 60s. It looks, sounds, and IS great. Thanks Disney! Thanks!"
5,Excellent Adventure,"Dr. Syn: The Scarecrow of Romney MarshI have been waiting years to own this excellent historical adventure and I was not disappointed. I remember watching ""Dr. Syn, the Scarecrow of Romney Marsh"" when it first aired on the Wonderful World of Color and couldn't wait for the next episode. This was Patrick McGoohan at his best and I immediately fell in love with the cool, intelligent, handsome vicar. It's amazing how much of it I remembered after all these years so it definitely made a lasting impression on a 12-year-old. I'm so glad it has now been released so others can enjoy this timeless treasure. It was well worth the wait! Thank you, Walt Disney productions and Amazon!"
4,The Scarecrow of Romney Marsh,"I have waited for years for this DVD and purchased it the day it was released. On a whole the restoration is well done and the sound quality is execellent. There was one error in my copy. A few minutes into TV episode III, there is a scene where the American escapee knocks on Dr Syn's door and requests sanctuary. This scene is actually several minutes from TV episode I! After the scene plays out, episode III continues. I couldn't believe that one of the most anticipated releases from Disney would contain such a mistake. I'm glad to have the dvd, but it is regretful that someone at Disney didn't catch the error before it was produced."
1,Thanks for nothing,"Like others, I was signed up to be notified by Amazon when this dvd was to be released, but never received any notification. Add to that Disney's BONEHEADED move of discontinuing it almost immediately, and you end up with a lot of frustrated customers. (Walt must be spinning in his grave.) I have a hard time paying 250% of the original price for a dvd that was just released."
4,Terribly Over Priced,"I recall this Disney production and even have fond memories, as a boy, of high adventure on 'the southern coast of England'; but the cost of revisiting those fond memories is just too high. Perhaps a more reasonable price would prompt myself, and others, to take that trip back to more youthful times. High marks for the series but zero stars for over-the-top pricing."
1,save yourself from being a Corporate Sucker,Save yourself the greedy price for this . .watch the whole thing on Youtube . . ironic that the main character of this great series would be howling like a banshee at the King's ransom that is being asked for here. Dr. Syn would hang these bastages from the nearest tree.
5,Disney Wonderfest,"DIsney classic -should of been released years ago. Came on time,no problem. Unlike dealing with PBJWORLD, THAT SELL XP PROFESSIONAL WITH FAKE PRODUCT CODE. Then lies and refuses to deal with customers honesty. BEWARE OF 3RD PARTY SELLERSKnow who you are dealing with . Amazon needs to have a better way to deal with disputes between 3rd sellers than telling them to return it to a person who sells fake xp software.A lesson to be learned . Know who your dealing with . Stay away from Pbjworld . No matter what their ratings say .JTS"
1,Horrible DVD release,"I am so furious that I was never notified by e-mail that this was released on DVD. Its amazing that there are billions of people in the world and some genius decided to produce only 35,000 copies of this show on DVD. I hope all you greedy jerks that scalped ten of these at a time get stuck with every single copy you bought. It's unfortunate that disney released such a low ammount on dvd and that there are pricks out there that take advantage of these situations. It's to bad you can't give negative stars in the feedback because I would give this product a -5. I don't care how amazing the show is and looks on DVD, the limited release is what puts this product in the negatives for me. Even if I had obtained a copy of this I would still have rated it this way."
1,Disney is at fault,"Don't Fault Amazon. Fault Disney. They only released copies to those who belonged to their club and some retailers. These areas got them, and are the ones selling them at the nutty prices you are seeing on Amazon.Now here's another kick--You can get Dr. Syn, but it will cost you $500 and it will be included in a Christmas release (if you belong to the Disney club)with a lot of other titles that only had a small number of copies released.I have seen the release pictured here at a friend's house. And it is very good. Personally, I can do without all the extra stuff in the tin and just have the orginial mini-series/movie.At this time, other than the special, Disney is not releasing this again."
5,Excellent production of the classic,"I've been waiting for a DVD of this great, classic Disney show from my youth. This DVD production is extremely well done, video and audio. Really fabulous show."
5,scarecrow of romney marsh,"As I was only 9 when I first and last saw The Scarecrow of Romney Marsh, I always thought the movie was really good but was hesitant about if really was as that was so long ago.I can tell you that The Scarecrow is such a classic.All ages will enjoy the 3-part results."
1,$299.95 No Way,"This is only a comment about the price and not the a review of the movie. The price, $299.95, is absurdly high and multi-millionaire I wouldn't give way to extortion.I was 10 years odl when this appeared on Disney and I recall being excited about it at the time. But like millions of others, I ended watching the Beatles on the Ed Sullivan Show instead. After all these years I was just reminded of Scarecrow and figred I'd check it out. But not at this price."
5,Finaly released,"Sure took them along time to release. Loved watching it in the 60's growing up, on The Wonderful World of Disney. Quality great, a great classic added to the lineup."
5,At last!,"It is about time. I loved this when I first saw it on the Wonderful World of Disney when I was a kid. My much loved VHS tape is wearing out. November can't come soon enough.A great swashbuckler adventure, made for TV film. Based on the novel by Russell Thorndike. Patrick McGoohan is wonderful as the parson of Romney Marsh. Good supporting cast."
4,The Scarecrow,The DVD is outstanding. The movie brought back memories of my childhood when every Sunday we would watch Walt Disney's Wounderful World of Color. The Scarecrow was one of my all time favorites. Disney's marketing of the DVD on the other hand was deplorable. The very limited release with some individuals able to buy up quantities of the DVD and then offering them for sale at 4 to 5 times what they were orignially selling for just plain sucks.
2,The games are okay....,"But, they're not that good. If I had to do it again, I would keep my money and go to download.com to find free games. There are many demos that you'll have to pay for to keep on your PDA if you like them."
5,Decent Buy,I bought this manual through Amazon Prime. It came brand new and it was probably around $10 cheaper than my bookstore so it was a good buy.
1,Wrong size on product discription,The product description says this adaptor is 58mm. It is in fact 52mm . It does fit the camera it says it will .
4,A milestone in Garfunkel's production.,"As a singer, Art Garfunkel has always mantained a quality standard in his recordings through the careful selection of the music and the clean production team. This is not just a simple record but a major production in his discography. It produced his Paul Simon's hit ""My Little Town"" and one the best interpretations of ""I Only Have Eyes For You""."
5,Breakaway art garfunkel,"A friend of mine recorded this album for me many many years ago on cassete no less.. it took me a long time to get the cd now at a time when cd's are becomming obsolete even. There is something about garfunkel's voice that is just hard to explain, but i like it and i really like this album--cd good price too THANKS AMAZON"
5,My Favorite Relaxation CD,"This should be a ""Must Have"". His sound can't be duplicated. This music gently flows and lulls you into a relaxed and feel good state - like a sweet whisper. Some time ago, use to relax to it every night on cassette - gotta have it on CD."
5,Breakaway,"This is a great CD. I bought the vinyl record years ago and have almost worn it out. I decided I needed the CD. The song ""Breakaway"" is one of my favorite songs."
4,"Art Garfunkel's ""Breakaway"" from the best 60's duo","One of the 60's and 70's silken male voices. The mid-70""s was a neverending string of middle of the road classics. Romance and disco filled the air (waves) with hope and possibility. ""Breakaway"" was one of those LP's that went on like a Rachmaninov symphony. Each song blended into the next (and not like mindless muzac). But rather like melodic lullabies you want to forever memorize. ""I Believe (When I Fall In Love It Will Be Forever)"" and ""I Only Have Eyes For You"" are always acknowleged as the two great tunes on this LP. However, the one I thought that really deserved the prize was ""99 Miles From L.A.,"" one of Albert Hammond's best efforts. ""Breakaway"" is a great tune. ""Disney Girls"" and ""My Little Town"" also quickly caught my ear. It was a great surprise this CD available and great to hear it again, only this time on CD."
4,Richard Perry brings out the best in Art Garfunkel,"A step up from 1973's ""Angel Clare"" (which was co-produced by Art Garfunkel and Roy Halee), this 1975 LP is led by the guiding hand of Richard Perry, who filled it with ballads containing lush orchestral arrangements, perfect for Garfunkel's mellow style and ranging vocal abilities. Especially notable on this album are the songs ""I Believe,"" ""Disney Girls,"" ""I Only Have Eyes For You,"" ""99 Miles From L.A.,"" and a beautiful song to wrap up this effort, ""The Same Old Tears On A New Background."" Although Art didn't have the same amount of commercial success as his longtime partner, Paul Simon, this CD is definitely worth a listen, as there isn't a bad song on it."
5,Soundtrack of your life,"Listening to these sublime cuts again, I'm a teen back in my upstairs bedroom, wailing along to ""Looking for the Right One"" and ""Same Old Tears on a New Background."" How refreshing to hear that all these decades later, these songs still hold up beyond their pure nostalgic jolt. The production on this record is just superb -- I don't think AG has ever sounded better on a recording before or since, with PS or without. (BTW, I just saw AG in concert here in Chicagoland and -- wonder of wonders -- he sounds as good at 60 as he did at 25.... a real rarity for pop singers.)Take my advice -- get rid of your scratchy worn out LP -- buy this CD today."
2,Interesting but needs revision,"Jerrell's book contains interesting and original information, but, as a former editor, I find too many errors reduce confidence in the content. Index points to the wrong pages, illustrations are mislabeled or missing, and there are some content errors. I hope Jerrell produces a new, revised and corrected edition."
4,Princess is spelled PRINCESSE!,"The set is beautiful. It has a nice weight to it, so it's not going to move when your pet eats from it. It was too high for my very small chihuahua pup, so I returned it. In addition, if you own other merchandise with the word ""Princess"" written on it, you'll notice that this is spelled ""Princesse"", with an ""e"" on the end. Not a big deal for most, but to some obsessive-compulsive types, it might make you a bit nutty!"
5,Fit for a Queen,The Glamour Pet dish is wonderful. It is the perfect height for my dog. This is the second dish set of this style I have purchased. I was upset when the original one broke and was not able to locate a replacement at the store. A happy puppy is a happy owner!
5,A real thriller!!!,"Thriller writer, Lisa Polisar, is in top form with her second book Knee Deep. I especially liked the setting of this one, which takes place all over the enitre state of New Mexico-from big cities like Albuquerque to tiny dots on the map like Tierra Amarilla. BLM(Bureau of Land Management) District Ranger, Leo Drucker, is up to his eyeballs in an unsolved case. And he doesnt realize until its nearly too late how inextricably tied he is to the victim, the victims sister and the underlying reason for her brutal murder. What I didnt expect is how attached I got to a relatively minor character-BLM underling, Frannie DiCosta. She and Drucker make a great pair, and I'm hoping Polisar will bring both of them back in her next book.Melissa Mackwell"
3,Guess Who? Maybe not.,"The original Guess Who game is my five-year-old son's favorite game, but he doesn't seem to like this one quite as much. The pros: the same easy game to play, inexpensive. The cons: the pictures are smaller, the cards are smaller, the cards fall out of their holders (but this is true in the original game), cheap construction. As an educator, I am particularly disappointed that the chosen characters don't have enough attributes for the guessing part to be engaging or to help kids build skills. Without enough attributes it is hard to throw the occasional game - although I rarely have to take a fall because my son can beat me fair and square most of the time. Also, it seems as if the characters were picked at random and not typical Disney favorites. Get this if you want a change from the original, but don't be suprised if it doesn't live up to your expectations."
4,Like a Spy game,I am 6 years old and this game is kind of easy for me. It is fun. When I first played it it is pretty fun. I like it now to but is easier for me now. You have to figure out who the other person's card it. You can ask one question per turn. It is cool. Other kids like it too.
1,"POORLY MADE, UNPLAYABLE","If you're looking for a toy that actually works like the original ""Guess Who"", don't waste your money. Despite carefully assembling the toy (snapping out, clicking on the ""flip up"" card holders; inserting cards by ""threading"" through the plastic holders), the toy does not function as it should.The plastic holders stick, and when pulled - gently - to unstick, come completely off the base; the cards slip out with the slightest movement.This game was on the top of my son's Christmas list, and was a complete disappointment and waste of money. The toymaker should be ashamed of themselves for riding the coat tails of the popular ""Guess Who"" with this piece of junk."
3,Good Game for young ones,"This is a spin off from the original ""Guess Who"" - but the questions you can ask each other are very limited. The tabs come off this frame very easily and are kinda flimsy. The good thing is for younger children they all know the characters, so reading is not necessary."
4,The Maine view,The book was an easy read on the plane. The characters were easy to get to know and interesting. The plot was not contrived or predictable. Ready for the next one!
3,"Fun, smart and educational!","This book is like the first day of spring, when you can put the top down on your car ... a real joy ride, with the thought that you know it is going to get cold again!An incredibly interesting story, unfortunately we all know from the TV news magazines that there have been actual cases of the surgery detailed in this book done on unknowing patients.However, it is also a delightful trip around Lake Tahoe, the changing of the season's - if you have ever been there you will love reliving your memories, if you have not - buy your tickets now!With easy to follow story lines and characters about whom you quickly begin to care, I'm sure you will find it an enjoyable read!Have fun."
5,Journey Pre Teenybopper music,"Journey Sold out to main stream teeny bopper music scene in the late 1970s/early 1980s. After Next (3rd record) when they gained their lead singer Steve Perry, and lost Greg Rollie they lost their roots. Their first three albums were their best albums. Neal Schon and Greg Rollie were in early Santana Bands, and toured with Santana as opening band in the mid 1970's when Neal and Greg split to form Journey, they were fantastic. I once saw them open for Santana at Cal Poly SLO, then Santana came on and at the end of the concert Santana had Neal and Greg come up and play two encores with them, those were the days. The best music they ever played, then they sold out to the commercial market. Oh, well, thats business, they were excellent once, in the beginning."
3,"Solid, but not as good as the other 2 Pre-Perry recordings","This is a solid CD, but nothing that will shake your world. This is a Pre Steve Perry Journey recording, and the style resembles 1970's Santana (of course Schon and Rolie were in Santana) more than the Journey that most people remember from the radio. Having said that this is a solid recording with good musicianship, and solid song writing. There is nothing on this CD that's going to make you kick yourself for not finding this CD earlier. However, it is a good CD to put in every couple of years, and fun to listen to the excellent quality of musicianship that this band had.If your looking for a better example of Pre-Perry Journey; try Journey's self titled CD, or the CD titled ""Next."" I feel they are both superior to this CD in my humble opinion."
5,A must have Progressive Rock album,I think Corporate Rock killed Progressive Rock in the mid 70s the same way Nirvana killed Hair Metal in the early 90s. But Journey survived through that with Steve Perry at the right time and place. This CD has some great music on it and really this Journey is a different band at this point in time. Nice to still be able to discover some awesome rock even if it's not new. The bands of 2011 should listen to this and get some better influences into their bland sounds.
3,Would like to see a 2nd edition,"I was rather disappointed in this phrase book. An otherwise excellent little book is marred because it was not edited.The drawings are useful. The phrases are useful. The set-up is easy-to-use.However, much of the grammar is incorrect. This could have easily been corrected by a competent editor. I hope Builder Books will issue a 2nd edition of this book with the grammar corrected."
4,handy for a lot of situations,It also has little diagrams with the words in spanish so that you even if the words aren't flowing you can have a discussion about the project. Has been useful a number of times.
4,I love this toothpaste,"""Beaching"" Why the heck is a dentist spelling words like that? I think that this is the best toothpaste I've tried. I've used the colgates, the crests, the aquafresh's & seriously this toothpaste is fabulous. My teeth are the whitest they've ever been. Yes it is a little pricey but I consider the benefit outweighs the cost for a better dental experience. The only con I have with the toothpaste is that Rembrandt gives you only 2.6 oz, which for me lasts barely a month."
5,I love it!!,"I only got this toothpaste a couple days ago and the very first night I used it my teeth felt like porcelain! They felt so clean and polished it was amazing. My teeth had zero plaque on them after and my husband already commented on how white my teeth are! There is no weird taste, no burn, no strong smell. I can really tell its working from the inside out. Im not a coffee drinker but the toothpaste I was using just wasn't "" whitening"" my teeth like it claim but this toothpaste is really doing what it claims. It's working amazing so far but for a long term not sure yet."
5,Awesome.,"This is the only whitening toothpaste that works for me. None other do, this stuff works absolutely great! Combine with the mouthwash and $$$"
2,Rip off,"I bought this toothpaste because my usual Sensodyne was not available at Rite Aid. The first thing I noticed was how plump and full the tube was... Wrong. As soon as you try to squeeze out the product you realize that the damn thing is half full of air.While brushing, the toothpaste created a disgusting cigarette smoke smell which I could only stand for a few minutes before having to prematurely quit brushing. It was the oddest thing, I've never experienced anything like that before.I gave this toothpaste two stars because my teeth do feel very clean and actually already look a little whiter, but I would never buy this again.i don't even think I'll be able to finish the tube."
2,Cheap Tailand condoms,"I was ordering 48 condoms-but I got only 46. I don`t know where they lost enother my 2 condoms. Quality of condoms are very bad. Color is muddy, not transparent and if you look more thoroughly - you can see that inside is like white cream - pulver. Thanks God they don`t broke. I will never agan buy any product from Tailand! Better pay more and get good quality."
1,Anaperna,"I think this book was a buntch of gret humor and enjoyable for everyone. I thought the book was way to long, books should have a 50 page limit. Although too long for my enjoyment I would like everyone to read it. The main charecter was a great person. My friend Whitney says ""this book was not good!"" But i beg to differ it was bad."
3,Instrumental Prowess With Less Defined Melodies,"Sorry this CD falls short of its predecessor Blow by Blow. There are several good jams particularly on Blue Wind and Sophie. Jeff is certainly on top of his game with the guitar. The keyboards are decent as well although I prefer Max Middleton's touches from the Blow by Blow CD.Yes, Blow by Blow stands as a classic fusion driven CD. Those jams just had memorable melodies and awesome jams. Wired is a noticeable cut below as the melodies just do not fully stand out. Nonetheless, Jeff Beck's talents certainly make this CD at least a reasonable listen if not an overwhelming joy."
4,Good but not the best,"It would be hard to follow up a masterpiece and be even half as successful as Beck was. ""Wired"" is a good album, yet I feel that it's not quite as focused or innovative as ""Blow by Blow"" was. It does start out great, and ""Led Boots"" with it's heavy intense funk, is a highpoint, but it doesn't go on so well from there. There's a few mellower tracks that were written by Narada Michael Wilson that aren't as memorable, and ""Blue Wind"" isn't that great to my ears. ""Goodbye Porkpie Hat"" is another slow ballady song, written by a legend (Charlie Mingus), but it doesn't have the effect that ""Cause We've Ended as Lovers"" did on me. Maybe i'm being too harsh here, and maybe I should let it stand on its own. However, you'd expect top grade quality from Beck, especially after following up something so great. It's worth a listen, and again it's all based on preferences. Don't get mad at me for having my own opinion."
5,Amazing album,This album is a very addicting catchy album and that goes along with blow by blow the music is amazing jeff beck is a amazing guitar player and a great influence to me i love his music also jeff beck live a ronnie scotts is breath taking and stunning i watch that dvd so much please take an interest and buy jeff beck if you have never heard him start with blow by blow and wired also get the dvd ronnie scotts
5,cd review,"An older Jeff Beck album which sounds great on cd . Very happy with the quzlity, sound and timeliness of shipment. Thanks"
5,Beck plays Fusion !!,"""Wired"" is a great album. It's better than I expected. I was hoping for a fusion album, and I got it. I like this album !!!"
5,WHOA!,"IF THERE WAS A GOD OF GUITARS, JEFF BECK WOULD BE IT. This ablum is truly a classic. After all, Who Else! is great, and it probably grew out of WIRED! A personal fave: Sophie"
5,Vital record,"No need for words as the music & its performances speak for themselves. The only knock I give it...it's not long enough by today's standards. I've owned on vinyl with 3 cd versions, original-remastered and MFSL and never get tired of listening to this and Blow by Blow.Jeff...help us with all the crap out there and try to revive this even you're outspoken on this being not your best work. Millions disagree with you. Knock off the sounds effects, techno-esque, motor revving dubs and PLAY."
4,It doesn't get more 70's sounding...,"...and those wailing pictures of Jeff on the back, with his super-tight jeans, and goofy hair are funny as hell. This album is very similar to ""Blow By Blow"", only it has a harder, more tripped-out edge to it, and that wirey guitar sound really dates this album more than the others. I prefer ""There and Back"" for its less up-tight jazz oriented, more melodic rock guitar style."
5,Excellent!,"I really like this CD. It is one of my best rock CD I have ever heard. I think he is a NO1 rock guitarlist in the world. His concert was great, too. It was the best rock concert I have ever been to. I like all songs, especially, Blue Wind and Sophie."
5,excellent!!!!!,I have the original vinyl from 1976...and also have the first cd release...this blows that away....no comparison.I agree with the oether reviewers....if you want to hear Jeff play his best.....you need this CD
5,Have the earlier CD release....,"...and it's a little noisy. I'll probably pick up this digitally remastered copy. That'll make 3 copies of ""Wired"" I own, since I picked up the vinyl version when it was released in `76.Musically, this (and BBB) are the benchmarks for rock instrumental. It's easy to see where my current favorite (Eric Johnson) received a ton of his inspiration.I especially like ""Goodbye Porkpie Hat."""
4,Super-Sonic!,"Blow by Blow got the ball rolling, but in my view Jeff Beck's Jazz/Rock/Funk vision was perfected on the wonderful Wired. This stuff is so exciting --like being in a car chase in Jim Rockford's Firebird or riding in a jet fighter plane! Beck plays with both passion and virtuosity, which make a great combination. One of few guitarists who plays as if by will, Beck will sweep you off your feet with his playing on this CD, as long as you're willing to take the ride. 'Sophie' is unforgettable."
4,Works well,Got this for my 2002 Elantra GT. So far it works as expected. Amazon has the best price and free shipping.

3,I WOULD RECOMMEND OTHERS BEFORE THIS ONE!,"The only reason this book deserved a three-star rating is for the nice photography and the basic information. If you know nothing about Persians, and have never had one, then whatever you learn is a plus and you would probably benefit from this book. However, if you are experienced with Persians, you will probably find little here that you do not already know, or have not already read in other general cat care books. Granted, many cat breeds have some distinct characteristics, such as the tendancy of some Persians' eyes to ""tear and run,"" and the extra grooming requirements necessary not only for Persians but for any long-haired cat. It is what you might call ""Lesson 101 in Persian Education."""
5,Arthur Schnitzler: Leutant Gustl,"Schnitzler führt hier den inneren Dialog eines mittelmässigen Leutants ein, der - befangen in antiquierten Ehrvorstellungen - sein wahres Ich im Verlauf der Erzählung zu erkennen gibt. Hervorragend."
1,Not Cobham's best,"I saw this band live twenty-five years ago and still have the original vinyl. It is a very dated disc and does not reach the level of his first four albums:Spectrum,Total Eclipse, Crosswinds and Shabazz which are classics from the 70's."
5,A True Gem!,"This album contains four super-bad players at their creative and technical primes. If you are a fan of any of these guys' other works, you'll certainly love this. (In case you don't know, it's John Scofield on guitar and Alphonso Johnson on bass.)It took one listen to come up with a five star rating for this album. It grooves enough to rock the party and is sophisticated enough to sit down and analyze. Like it suggests on the liner notes, what a shame that this is the only album these four did together!"
3,decent effort,"Some good funky playing on here, but also some totally throwaway silliness like ""Space Lady"" ruins the flow. To me, this sort of fusion jazz sounds a bit dated 30 years after the fact. But hey, it was the 70s so you had to have drum solos and all that stuff. The musicianship is top notch, as fans of Duke and Cobham would expect, but overall I think the material on this album is not their strongest."
3,If Only It Lasted,"This rifle is really great when you first get it out of the box and start using it. However, it is not nearly as durable as similar Nerf guns. For a few hours of fun, I would recommend it. However, if you know your kids like Nerf guns and are into the concept - go ahead and spend a few extra dollars and get the Nerf items - you will not be sorry."
3,This is good but not the best.,I think why it jams so much is because the barrel is so LLLLLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOONNNNNNNNNNGGGGGGGGGGG so if a dart is bent it can go side ways and jam. Plus if you HATE air restrictors dont by this gun (the shells are air restrictores).
1,Pure Wast of Money,"Got this for my 6 year old son because 1) he wanted something to go with his blazing fast Rapid Fire, and 2) he wanted a shotgun to mimic his ""Gears of War"" characters.Open it up, load the shells, and........Nothing. This thing couldn't even shoot the darts out of the shells! Definitely going back to get a refund. It sure ejects the shells nice. Even on the surface though, would you really want a blaster where you need to put the darts into shells, and then load the shells all while you're trying to run around? Plus, you only get two rounds of fire-time before you need to reload. Lame, at best.If you want a ""Real"" blaster, stick with a Nerf namebrand."
1,Rapid Fire? Hardly the case...,"The nerf bullets are constantly getting jammed or stuck inside of the barrel of this gun. Too hard for my 5 year old to use, he got very frustrated and even said it was cheap. Love the 5 year olds honesty! It is a cheap toy. Wish I would have spent more money on something that would actually work."
1,Not good.,"Nice idea, but the shells scattering and they way you cock it is impractical for nerf wars. to reload, you need the shell. if you are running around, you're bound to lose some shells. Also, you may break it if your priming it and running. Stick with the Longshot. Way more reliable."
2,medeocre. massive jamming problem,"this gun is extremely durable. not that powerful. reloading is a pain, the shells pop out all over the place, and when i try to fire, it gets jammed half the time.i wouldn't reccomend it.pros: very durable, portable, ammo container in backcons: not particularily powerful, reloading is a pain, sluggish shot, jamming happens often, sometimes doesn't shoot altogetherbottom line: my night finder is about as cheap as this, and more powerful. no to mention easy to mod. buy that instead."
4,COOL!!!,I bought this gun because it reminded me of the double barreled shotgun from Doom 2. That was my favorite gun in the whole game. I was alays hoping that they would make something like this. When I found this one I had to buy it. I just wish it came with more shells.
1,It's a piece of JUNK!!!!!!!!,"My little brother bought this gun yesterday, and it worked for only one day, and then the trigger wouldn't work right, and none of the darts would fire. He's very upset about this and is sad that he can't get his money back. Spend your money on something else."
1,Piece of junk,"My son saw this and really REALLY wanted it for his birthday and was SO excited to get it. Well, it worked for a couple of shots, then didn't. Then would only shoot from one side. Then stopped. He was pretty upset about it, so I am returning it."
4,Just like a real shotgun!!!!!!!!!!!,I've shot a shotgun and believe me this thing is almost the real thing!!! I'ts very durabal and the price is worth it.
4,"For what it is, it's awesome","Despite its many flaws, this toy shotgun is actually pretty awesome. Currently, its barrel is wrapped in duct-tape (the barrel fell apart), and I've had to open up the gun to fix the springs a couple times; so durability-wise: the toy is a piece of junk. But when living in a dorm, a ""nerf"" shotgun is pretty-much the coolest thing ever (I realize it's the cheap knock-off brand, but really, who cares?). I stormed my RA's room many-times...Overall, if you're willing to work with a toy when it quits working, this one is worth getting. If you're someone who gives up when something breaks, don't get it. Along those lines, don't buy this for your kids if you're not going to supervise their playing with it... they will need you to fix it, and why would you let your kid play with projectiles unsupervised?"
1,Not good,"I got this gun in hopes that it'd be fun to play around with the family, and I got maybe 4 shots that came out with both darts, and then another 5 that were just one dart at a time. And now that I'm the second day of playing with it, I can't get it to fire any of the darts."
1,it is the worst gun ever,"if your shot gun is not working ,just do not take it apart and fixing it . if you do that the gun will not work again . it is just you throw it away than opening it and fixing it ."
4,Cosplay perfection!,"Well, if anyone has played Team Fortress 2 we all know that the Scout has a shotgun called the FaN and this worked perfect for a cosplay demonstration me and 8 of my friends put on. Just saw off the ends and hit it with a little paint and youre good to go! Amazing work on the toy. Love it."
3,Good fun,The kids love this toy. Loading the gun can be a bit of a hassle but overall this is a good buy.
4,Fun Toy,"My son was excited to receive this gun and greatly enjoyed it. I would recommend that it be made easier to cock. My son has to put the barrell end down on something and then lean on it with all of his weight in order to make the darts engage. (And he's not a small child.) Would also like to see offered with more darts. But all that aside, he has loved the gun and it is holding up well."
5,This is great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"i have this gun and it rocks. the only thing is i dont like the colors.it looks weird. so i spray painted mine and it looks soo much better now!!!the range is pretty good even if it is a shot gun. i saw this at targetand knew i needed it so i purchised it with left over birth day money.at first i thought it would break right away. it looks cheep on the out side but i was wrong!i have had it for a year and it is still working great.the reloading time is a pain but. . .i use the nerf shot gun now and every once and awhile i get this out to play with.totally worth the money. works great, feels great, looks great, (after you spray paint), and is great!!!get it"
2,"I love this gun, but...","I love this gun. It's one of my favorite dart guns I have. But I'm giving it 2 stars because it doesn't fire out of both barrels. I knew that might happen. I didn't care if that happened. I just assumed that something was jammed, like a spring or something. I wasn't going to try to fix it, but when I got curious and started trying to find what the problem was, thats when I got a little mad. When you cock open to reload, you can kind of see the inside of the gun if you look below the barrel. That's where the problem was. There was no spring OR the part that pops up the spring so it can shoot on the left side. If there were no spring or part that pops it up, I wouldn't be mad, but since neither were there, I think it only deserves 2 stars."
4,Fun,I went to a Walmart to Find a Nerf gun or something and I found this gun. I bought it and took it home. This thing is completely amazing! Not perfect for long range and the right barrel is more powerful than the left but i had a blast playing with it shooting people. So you should get this gun. :D
4,It's a fun toy for a 10 year old,My son begged me for this toy for his birthday. Some of his friends had one. They all enjoy playing it and since it is 'nerf-like' it is not at all dangerous. It seems very durable so far. I will look at BuzzBee Toys in the future
1,doesn't shoot,"this product blew the whole idea of the Christmas morning hunting with my grandson... only shoots 1 of 10 shots up to 6', the others don't even make it out of the barrel... keep looking"
3,Double Shot!,"When I bought this gun it worked fairly well. It shot about average distance and was pretty acurate. After about 6 months of owning it its performance started to drop. Somtimes it would shoot a few feet, somtimes it would't shoot at all. After a while it just plain didn't work. I am not saying you shouldn't buy it just don't think it will be any thing grand. I think it is over priced slightly. If you are thinking about getting this I highly suggest you look into the tommy mech 20. It is 6 times better, made by the same brand and is definitly worth the extra 10 or so bucks.(check out my review onthe mech tommy 20 for more info)"
1,waste of money,This was a huge let down. my son was so excited to play with it but after five minutes he was frustrated and just threw it down.
3,Lota fun.... as long as it works.,"BuzzBee is NOT nerf. I got this as a gift from someone who owned the nerf version. I was psyched until i tried it and found that the shells don't eject like they should. To me, this is the best feature of the gun and without it, its just a very slow firing/loading dart gun. It seems that alot of people are reporting problems with the gun. Just shell out the few extra bucks for nerf or risk dissapointment this holiday."
4,"Great toy, but the bullets gets stuck in barrel sometimes","This is overall a great nerf toy. The shells ejection action is particularly satisfying. The somewhat disappointing area is the bullets sometimes get stuck in the barrel after the trigger is pulled.You can see videos of this on youtube and the bullets actually travels pretty far (~ 25 to almost 30 ft if you angle it up a bit).There's also sticker instruction on the gun's stock to tell how to fire single shot or dual shot. I have more luck pulling in the trigger hard to get both shots out than with single shot. With the single shot, my second one often peters out in less than 5 feet or failed to fire at all.My son is loving this toy (even with the occasional frustration of stuck bullets)."
4,The icing.,"Many of my clients spend hours by the computer,and from there they head home, to the gym or some conference or party.For this reason they've developed pot bellies.I was looking for a book that would help me view this lifestyle issue from a fresh perspective, and I came across this book.It affirmed my belief in interval training-something that I tailor to my different clients.It also gave me an important message-moderation!, something thatI bless my clients with.Many of them have adapted moderation into their lifestyles, and I thank David for affirming these words in me!you've helped me change lives.The abdominal exercises are superb,I got inspired to even perform the same exercises with my clients.Great inspiration"
4,Very educational.,This book was great and it brought to attention how much terrible things are used to mass produce foods today. I know have a better idea of what to avoid and what to eat a lot of. I have noticed a big difference in my life and the way I feel on an everyday basis.
4,Don't miss this album!,"I fell in love with the way he plays guitar when I listened to whitesnake album, since then I always try to find any record he involves. My wife bought it for me when she had a visit in california, usa. I really like it, the price is rather expensive compare to other CD but it worth my money. Listen to ""do or die"" reminds to ""we all fell down"" blue murder's song, it's a dynamite. Also ""she's all action"" the bass sounds great. I am looking forward to having his other cds. The one thing I feel uncomfortable is the price, why is it always much higher than other cds ?"
4,dated but still the best overall modern biography,"While this is the best overall modern biography of King John, it is a bit dated with so much new research having been done in this field. For those seriously interested in this subject, the works of Ralph Turner and S.D.Church should also be considered. If possible, the best overall biography still remains Kate Norgates but it is ancient at this point."
5,King John,"An excellent history book, factual as a text book but reads like a novel. Hollywood could never dream up a life or character so complex."
3,Good enough...,"...if you have another or a collection of previous Traviatas! Love the male singers. Hampson is perfect as Germont. Of course he can do more than this recording but he is still great. Villazon play Alfredo with passion, nothing new for him but he sounds very ""in love"". Netrebko is not one of my favorite female voices. But she is not all bad at the last act. Her Violeta sounds ill, desperate... enough to feel bad about her sad story. There is a few more perfect Violetas around. Just say Callas or even Gheorgieu!!! I think the real star of this production is Mr. Rizzi."
3,Uneven and unnecessary,"I was looking forward to this Traviata, but Anna Netrebko and Thomas Hampson can do much better than this. Hampson is very stolid, and seems ill at ease in his role. Anna sounds wonderful, her voice is still as beautiful as ever, but her studio recordings of Sempre Libera and her earlier performaces as Violetta were more refined, with more precise coloratura, and this is a step back. Her Italian is not very good, to say the least, I thought she would improve by now. Only Rolando Villazon is really excellent, his passionate Alfredo is the highlight of this album.My main problem is, why get this expensive set if we know that the DVD of this production is coming in a few months? This is not a bad Traviata, it is exciting in places, Carlo Rizzi leads energetic performance of the orchestra, but these singers are great actors, there's no point of listening to a CD when you could be watching them on stage..."
4,Almost great,"I am saving one more star for the DVD, but I think this is a beautiful Traviata. Anna Netrebko's interpretation may be not for everyone, she does sound sick and not just in the last act but as they say, bad acting choice is better than no choice. Also, Hampson is disapointing. But Villazon is absolutely riveting! What a dream pair for this production! Forget about the hissing old recordings, let's not live in the past. Netrebko and Villazon are among the best of the currently performing singers, captured at their peak. I love Gheorgiou's Traviata from Covent Garden, this one is different but still great. This recording is best one to get if you don't have many other Traviatas in your collection, and it makes for a great appetizer for upcoming DVD and- let's hope!- more live performances."
5,Perfect!,"The 1 liter size fits my .75L bottle just fine. It appears to be of good quality. I wanted a strap so that I can hang it around my neck, or across my body, when I mow. I think this will be perfect for me!"
4,"Like the product, but insulation isn't best.","Like the product, but the insulation is a wool-type substance and the water doesn't stay cold. I like that my kids can carry their own bottles and there is a pocket for little things like keys."
4,"sturdy, but size problem","this holder is very thick and sturdy. However, i got the 1 liter size. I have different size, shape and style bottles. It is too tall for all of them. It fits very snug in diameter. I have the top rolled down (like a waist band that's too high). I plan on ordering the smaller size to see if it fits better, though i have a feeling if the height fits, the width may be too small.also, the pocket on the front is pretty small...(compared to my old one)... my cell phone will just barily fit, so i guess it's just big enough for me...(but i have a small phone)"
5,What I had searched for,This is exactly what I had been searching in stores and online for and at a better price than I expected.
1,NO WATER BOTTLES!!!,"I was thourghly disappointed with the Frozen Water Bottles. When I received what I thought was going to be the sleaves and the water bottles, it only had the sleaves. There should have been in BIG letters that the bottles did not come with them!!!The pictures clearly show the water bottles with the sleaves."
2,Insulated Water bottle holder,It's ok but it should really have a handle as it's hard to hold on to and think the water bottle should have been included for the price.
3,The Insulated Sport Sac Water Bottle Holder is very good.,"I took the holder to Disneyworld and it kept the soda cold for a few hours, but the only thing I have to say is that the holder is too long for a soda bottle I put a small towel in the bottom which helped but the container would not stand up straight when put on a hard surface. I brought it home and put a styrofoam disc in the bottom and it works great. In fact I just bought another one for a friend of mine."
3,Wish it came with a bottle,"I bought this as a gift for a friend. She had admired my Coleman one for a few months and wanted something she could store her club card in that she wouldn't lose or forget when going to the gym. I couldn't find anything like mine except for this. It seems like good quality. She has not used it yet, I can only guess that it's because she needs a bottle that fits in it. would have been nice if it came with a compatible bottle."
4,This is worth the money.,"This works well - no frills, just a convenient carrier that keeps the contents cool for a while. I like it."
2,Water Bottle Not Included,"Although a bottle is in the photo, it is not included. Yes I should have paid more attention to the title word, ""Holder"""
3,"Right size....a bit flimsy, but works for me","I had been looking for a water bottle holder for some time, This is still a bit big for my large Camel back water bottle, but I still am very happy to have it."
2,Poor construction,"I purchased this to use with a nalgene bottle. The bottle fit snugly, but when I was tugging on the collar to remove the bottle, the upper cuff tore off, as if it was 'tear on the dotted line'. I can still use it as it was too tall for the bottle, but I am disappointed with the quality. CJ"
5,this almost works too good,"I freeze a bottle of water about 3/4 full and then top it off everynight I go to work. I bought a few a these insulated sport sac's with the hopes that they would help keep the water atleast cold all night. These things work way better then I anticipated!! I've left the bottle in the sac all day while I've slept, and when I've gotten up there was still ice in the bottle and the temp outside was in the 80's. They are well worth the money!!"
3,"Works okay, but not very durable","I bought this product in it's 2 liter size. It did seem to keep my drink cool for a little while longer than otherwise, but at the cost of covering up the bottle's handle and making it awkward to handle in that size. I kept it hung on a hook in the cab of the ambulance, so it didn't really get heavy wear, yet it frayed and ripped after only a few months of use. I wouldn't really bother buying another one."
3,Strap rough,"Needed a bottle holder for hiking. Bought three and the holder pouch is okay but the strap rubs rough on clothes. In fact the strap frayed my shirt. Tried another holder and that one frayed my jacket. So will have to wrap plastic around the strap as a sort of sleeve. Or, see if I can replace the strap from a sports store."
5,Great for Disney World!,We purchased these to take to Disney World and they really worked great. We froze our water bottles and still had ice in the early afternoon. They are comfortable to wear and will hold two smaller bottles of water or one large. The younger girls added a small snack. The zipper compartment was useful for my small cell phone on the water rides.
2,5 weeks and done,I bought this product to use at the gym. I had it for 5 weeks before the top portion seperated at the seam. Not sure if I can have it sewn. I doubt it is worth what they would charge me. Dissappointed it didn't last. It seemed to work pretty well while it was in one piece.
1,"Cheap, shoddy...","Bought this for my wife to use at work on her desk (not to carry around). While it does keep a frozen bottle colder, it began to fray and the insulation outer cover ripped at the seams. It is a good example of slipshod workmanship and material.Many reviewers note they love it, but ""I've only had it a few weeks"" is the common thread. Expect it to last only a month or two, and probably less if you use it while hiking or other outdoor activity.In sum: Don't bother."
3,Water Bottle Holder,"When I first received this product, I was impressed with it. I froze my water and it stayed cold the entire day (in hot summer weather in Hawaii) and I actually had ice at the end of the day. However, after about a three week daily use, the top portion broke. I contacted the seller and they did a one time offer to replace the holder (for this reason alone I have given them 2 additional stars). For what it's worth and the amount you pay, it's ok. Just remember this, it is made in China."
5,These hold the big 32 oz sodas,"I got these for Disney, and taking a drink into the parks. Great money saver. We only get the 16 oz waters, and they fit totally in the case. My 32 oz bottles fit with just the tops sticking out. Can't wait to use them this Dec."
4,Good Product,This product was a cool water bottle that my husband now uses for work. I bought it for him because his favorite color is blue. I rate it A++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
2,"Cheap, but Bad Fitting Size","These water bottle holders were cheap, but they don't fit tall bottle sizes commonly sold in stores. I bought three ""2.2"" liter sacs but a 1.5 liter tall bottle size found in most U.S. grocery and convenience stores still doesn't fit all the way in. These may be okay for light use just once in a while, but look somewhere else for something you want use on a regular basis or carry around for a full day. The merchant did deliver my items quickly, however."
1,Very disappointed!,The bottle holder is of very low quality. It has already torn at the top seam. Really wasn't what I expected. Next time I have to do more research
4,"Simple, but Useful presentation of Marxist Philosophy","This small book, by the American revolutionary George Novack, is a great intro into the philosophical underpinnings of Marxism. A must for all people beginning a study of Marxism. For all young Communists out there, this book provides a way to systemize and understand all those theories we've read about, and act as a jumping off point for further reading and study. Only drawback: It's open to capitalist accusations of being ""outdated"" since it was written in the 40s."
5,fantastic!,Well worth a read for anybody dealing with landscape painting and trying to think through it. It's well worth the $15 I paid.
3,Missing pages,The book was missing the first 13 pages! The rest of the book was in very good condition but I was disappointed!
2,450 pages too long,"The author had a great idea for a book. He collected enough 'meat' for about 30-50 pages and then exploded it into almost 500 pages of boring talk, so typical of many historians.There are a few gems in this book and those few who manage to persevere through the boredom of the text may find it somewhat rewarding. Had the author written a 50-page book that covers the essence of what he has to offer, this would have been a four or five star book."
4,Just needed one change,"This was my first dylan album and i thought was execellent with Hurricane, Black Diamond Bay, and Sara. Maybe make one change replace Joey with Seven Days it would be 5 stars"
3,"Not a great album, but merely good","I feel this album may be overrated a little. True, it's a good album and it does grow on you, but I can't help feeling a little bored when I'm listening to the whole album. I can't say that there are any really bad songs on Desire, but the only really great songs are in my opinion One more cup of coffee, Black Diamond Bay and Hurricane. A nice album, not one of his best."
4,"Put on your list as ""NEEDS RE-REMASTERING""","Certainly worth owning, but to my ears, one of the worst sounding CDs I've ever heard. No, I have not contradicted myself. The material itself is above average, with Emmylou Harris being the sweet icing on the cake. However, ""Joey"" sports some paper-thin sounding vocals, and the rest of the CD sounds poor, but seemingly not near as bad as ""Joey"". Never having heard the vinyl, it's hard to say if the same odd sounds would emulate from my stereo system listening to the record. BUT, I very seriously doubt it. B+ album, get the vinyl!"
5,One of his more laid-back albums yet very adventurous,"The album's sound is rich featuring uncommon instrumentation for Dylan songs (violin, bellzouki) and two extended pieces chronicling two different peoples' lives. There's a lively Mexican-flavored song (""Romance in Durango""), but most of these tunes are on the mellow tip. ""One More Cup of Coffee"" is particularly evocative of the lonesome traveller, while ""Isis"" is a wild romantic tale in part about being a pawn of circumstance. I haven't heard a Dylan album that sounds quite like this one. I consider it essential Dylan and one of my favorites."
5,A great Bob Dylan 70's record,"Everyone should own this record; it beats ""Greatest Hits"" with a stick. Sara reminds me of my ex-fiance. That enough should be enough to raise a glass to a heartbroken guy on St Simons."
4,Almost There,"""DESIRE"" is a great album. Full of wonderful, captivating songs such as ""Hurricaine"", ""Isis"", ""Romance in Durango"", ""Black Diamond Bay"" and ""Sara"".My only problem is that ""Joey"" seems to be out of place on the album. The song is interesting and decent on merit but doesn't really stay in tempo with the rest of the albums superior material.Bob recorded some great songs during the ""Desire"" sessions which never made the album that would have been more pleasing than ""Joey"" including ""Golden Loom"" with Emmylou Harris(you can find this on the ""bootleg series""), ""Seven Days"" and ""Abandoned Love""(which can be heard on the ""Biograph"" three CD collection).Otherwise, a terrific album."
3,"Good album, but not a great one","Following up the legendary ""Blood on the Tracks"" was a tall order, and Dylan certainly did not embarrass himself with the solid ""Desire."" With the presence of Scarlet Rivera's violin and songwriting assistance from Jacques Levy, the album has an ""artier"" feel than most Dylan albums. The presence of Emmylou Harris is yet another benefit that results in ""Desire"" getting a strong recommendation. But in comparison to his monumental work in the 60's as well as ""Blood On The Tracks"" this album lags a bit. In short: a solid album? You bet. Dylan's best? Not even in the running. 3 1/2 stars."
3,nothing special,"Although I am a huge Bob Dylan fan, I don't think this is one of his best CDs. I started off with Time out of Mind, and was struck by the tragedy of it, but after listening to the absolutely beautiful ""Sara"" I can start to understand. Also, ""Hurricane"" is another classic, but the rest of the CD, to me, is forgettable."
4,desire is DA FUNK,"This is an excellent album by Dylan albeit short. Equal praise to Dylan's collaborators on the album. Emmylou Harris on vocals and Scarlet Rivera (the violinist who appears on most of the tracks) bring a lot to the table on this release and mesh beautifully with Bob as accompanyists on superb tracks such as : Hurricane, Mozambique, One More Cup Of Coffee, Isis, and Joey. Don't buy the BS about Dylan's music sucking after the motorcycle accident or after the 60s. He still has plenty of juice here (and still going strong today). A worthy addition to your Dylan collection."
5,Album of the Century,"What a better tribute to ""The Hurricane"" than Bob Dylans song. I have never heard so many great songs on one album. Bob Dylan is successful again with Desire. The best singer, the best songs, Desire...you have GOT to buy it!"
4,A Musical Journey,"Not being completely familiar with other Dylan works, I felt this CD to be exceptionally well done. The combination of the minor tunes, echoes of guitar, piano and violin and Emmy Lou Harris voice, which were the classically well executed ""instruments"" and Bob Dylan's storytelling style of singing is hypnotizing. It also seems to carry one on a narrative journey. ""One More Cup of Coffee"" and ""Sara"" were the most heartrenching. Every one should at least experience this CD"
4,A review by Emily,"I like this record. It's one of my Dad's hippy records that he plays a lot. I don't usually like them, but I like this one a lot. This Bob Dylan guy is pretty good, even though he looks like all the other hippies on my Dad's records. Anyways, some of the songs I like are ""Hurricane"" which my Dad says is about what happened in New Orleans. I think it's kinda spooky how Mr. Dylan knew this was going to happen. I also like ""Sara"" which my Dad says is about Sara Michelle Geller, I guess she was Bob Dylan's wife at some point. The song I don't like very much is ""Joey"" which Dad says is about the guy on Friends. Also, on this album there are some nice backing vocals by Hillary Duff, at least that's who my Dad says it is, but I'm not too sure because she sounds different on her own albums. Ok, well that's it, bye!"
2,Very weak,"If you're a beginner to Dulan's sound, skip this album. If you're a long time fan, you probably already know this turkey.His is he mos uninspired DYlan album I've ever heard."
2,Now sounds lame - get the Rolling Thunder Bootleg (#5),"This used to be one of my fave Dylan discs, along with Blood on the Tracks and Basement Tapes. I just picked up Bootleg #5, which includes live versions of six of these tunes. Each one, especially the uptempo numbers (Hurricane, Isis, and Romance in Durango), rocks, putting the studio versions here to shame. If we had a similar, live version of Black Diamond Bay, I'd never put this disc on again."
1,The worst,"Man, this is one hell of a bad album by Dylan! People say it's one of his best!! Are you joking? The songs dragas and drags withou finishing, it's a nightmare! A big dissapointment, considering the fact that it came after the maervellous BLOOD ON THE TRACKS.DESIRE suc...s!"
1,Not his best AT ALL!!,"Such great reviews for this lousy album. It seems Dylan can do no wrong. He can! BLOOD ONT HE TRACKS is much better than this one here. The only worth track is ""HUrricane"". The rest is..."
5,Fantastic Historical Reference,"I found this book to be the most helpful source of information on unit histories for all ground troops in World War II for the U.S. Army. If you are a World War II history buff, and you really want to know the facts about how each group won the war in the European Theatre, this is your book. It also gives some general history for each unit before and after the war."
5,Big Don,"I dont remember the songs that are not in the show, But Don Johnson is the coolest. I wish season 4 would come out faster, it is like Miami Vice a season a year, it took that long, but i guess the best is worth the wait."
5,I want to go to Santiago de Cuba,This documentary is not just a must see for every Cuba connoisseur but also a delight for those who like to discover the dots that seemingly connect us all.
2,Slightly amusing take on the space visitor theme,"This is a slightly amusing comedy about a naive (idiot?) spaceman coming to Earth, trying to go native. Since the film came out, in 1960, the basic plot has since been hashed and rehashed and re-rehashed by Hollywood, so whatever novelty it once may have had has evaporated. The best part is when the couple go to a beatnik bar (beatnik being the precursors of hippies, daddy-o); that brought back memories."
1,NOOOOO!!!!! DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!,"This game is total garbage!!!!!! Do not waste your money on this garbage. You do stupid , repetitive minigames (all 3 of em) over and over again for each car. It is boring. You cant even see the customizations after you show the person after the end. GET A DIFFERENT GAME!!!!"
3,"""Just a list""",It's more or less just a list of names and the list is somewhat confusing with not all the abbreviations accounted for in the front. :( Was expecting so much more...
3,A decent chance of finding an ancestor if you know they emigrated between 1817-1869,"All right resource if you are looking to find the city of origin for someone who emigrated between 1817-1869 (approximately). From the publisher's website it is stated there are 13,5000 French & German emigrants listed."
1,"Alsace Immigration Book, Vol. 1","This is an alphabetical listing of immigrants from Alsace for a period of time that is not af any interest to me (I forgot what time period it is and cannot look it up because I returned the book).Also, the information is badly outdated.Unfortunately I could not find a brief review of this book before I purchased it."
4,Just a Blast!,"Harold Melvin and the Bluenotes with Teddy Pendergrass and Sharon Paige give us an album that you can listen to, dance fast or slow to, and sing along with. This is a classic album magnificently executed vocally and technically. Teddy is at his best, and his duet with Ms. Paige is still one of my all time favorites. These people are real singers, artists! and the Bluenotes in the background are pitch perfect. It's the music I grew up listening and dancing to and it still resonates in such a positive, upbeat way. When I play this disk, my guests all sing along or dance, or both!"
2,Western's,"If Cut-Throat Nine is a cult classic, cults must be getting more stupid. One of the worst movies I've ever scene. Despite getting 2 movies for the price of one, it still wasn't worth it !!!"
5,Outstanding,This is by far the best divination system I have ever used. I am delighted with it. I have bought extras for friends! This system is so on target it is like hearing from an old friend who knows you and your patterns all too well....and isn't afraid to tell you what direction they see you going in!I have been astonished by the accuracy time and time again. I highly recommend it on it's own or in addition to what you are currently using.
5,If knitting is your bag.,Every pattern is one I am going to try. I am knitting the baby blanket now.
4,Knit along with Debbie Macomer A good yarn,"Wonderful patterns. I love to knit so it makes sense that the patterns are great. Love her novels also, can't wait till a new knitting novel comes out. That way she has new patterns to go along with it. I myself made the Rainbow poncho in Red Heart classic and named it Monet rainbow, it turned out beautiful. All my church friends loved it. Some ladies in my church knit shawls for the elderly and sick and I do help with that. Keep up the good work Debbie and thanks."
3,Differcult to put on,"Good quality for the price, but very differcult to put on when you have to use the add-on sheeve. It took 15-20 minutes to install the sheeve."
4,an end time message for the seven churches,"Although I am the author, singer and executive producer of this CD, it is probably one of the best Gospel CD produced this year. My comments are confirmed by the number of testimonials of how this CD has impacted the lives of so many.The great thing about this CD is that it keeps you flowing. I call it ""The Gospel Sunshine"" because it makes you want to ride. The public should know that this CD was done in mind for those who want Gospel music with the windows down and the top back, which is the way we like to ""roll"" with our music in the State of Florida. In addition, the instrumentals are user friendly for those who are stuck at their work stations and need a little lift.By Faith Baby!!!"
3,Customer Support Totally Absent,"I've had my pc for about 2 weeks. I had ""issues"" trying to figure it out so I called customer service. I can tell you T-Mobile knows NOTHING useful about this product. After over 1 hr (three different occassions) I was transferred to level 2, level 3 and then told I needed to call Microsoft--which I had to pay $35 to fix the problem. When I asked T-Mobile if I could talk to someone knowledgeable about the product they put me on hold again, and came back apologizing that it's a new product! The phone is cool. It's heavy though. It works fine when you finally get support. If you're impatient you may consider another device."
3,+ features - quality,Boy was I excited to get this new all in one phone. Unfortunatly the cell coverage was poor to non existant. At time I could get one bar of signal strength but when I made a call it sounded like i was talking through a tunnel from the moon. The main reason I got the phone was for the cellular connectivity to the internet. I signed up for GPRS service and could not get a strong enough signal to use the service. I'll keep my toshiba e740 and live with internet connectivity limited to the home and office!
4,Buggy without software upgrade,"First I hated this phone because of the freezing problem. However, the latest upgrade from T-mobile fixed it. So now it is a pretty good device! How about making it smaller now?"
4,Great PDA......... OK Phone,"If your main use for this product is a PDA, it is an excellent choice. If you will primarily be using it as a phone..... maybe other options would be better. I have no complaints about the phone service. As with EVERY carrier you will experience a droppped call now and then. It's not your home phone DON'T expect it to be! My only problem is it's size. Excellent for a PDA, not so great for a phone. I use thousands of minutes a month of phone service and by the end of the day I feel like I've worked out. I KNOW someone will say get a head set, they include one. I don't know about you but I don't want to wear the thing everywhere I go and by the time you find it, untangle it and get that little nub into your your ear not only have you missed the call but your car could be wrapped around a tree!In closing I will say I'm very pleased with this product. The few short comings are greatly out numbered by the positive aspects that it contains."
3,celebrate Virginia Cook Book,"I like the book, and own one myself. I would give the cook book itself a 5 star ratings. Lots of interesting recipes, and history. The problem is, I intended to give the book as a gift. When I ordered it from Amazon, didn't realize I was buying a ""used"" book and unfortunately when it arrived discovered it had been inscribed as a gift to some one else. ie ""To Betty and Jon hope you enjoy..."" and was written on the front page. :-("
5,"Not for use in stopping a child, but does hold a door open","I bought this item thinking that I may use it to prop a door open, so that my cats could go in and out to get to their litter box, but so that my toddler could not fit through the opening. The door positioner worked to hold the door in place, but the door can easily be pushed open even by a toddler! I think the product works for its intended function, but if you are thinking of buying this for babyproofing, it is probably not the best product for that job."
1,"Useless, Do not send a open package product!","First of all, I do not want to be sent the one that is open packege (must be a return item, because it does not work!) When I recieved the product, the parts were outside the package and floating inside the envelope. The second of all, it does not work at all. My 1 year old son can easily open the door. What a waist of my money."
3,informative,I learnt alot about my puppy through reading this book. But I still feel there is a lot more to learn as she grows up and I don't think any book can do that .
2,Cute idea,"This was a cute book, but not very helpful. I didn't find anything too dachsund specific on here that I hadn't already read on the internet. Most of the content could relate to any breed. Too bad."
2,Fax,"As a veterinary technician, I can tell you with 100% backup from my veterinarian that dogs should not be fed ANY type of human food. Dogs should be fed a high quality DOG food and nothing else. A healthy DOG treat here and there is okay, but absolutely no human food. Any book that claims otherwise is obviously ill educated on the subject. I have seen the deadly effects of feeding dogs table scraps. I just wanted to voice that FACT so people will know that it is NOT good for their beloved pets."
1,"Crappy, simplistic and wrong","Either the person that wrote the book never has met a Dachsund or just hammered out the first thing that came to mind but none of the habits or actions of the animals in this book resemble those of the numerous Dachsunds I have owned over the decades.You can't raise a dog with a book anyway. Grow up people, get to know your dog and let it get to know you and soon enough you will come to have a great life together. Give your money to the Salvation Army instead of throwing it away on books on ""how to raise your dog"". Cripes!!"
3,GREAT FOR THE PRICE,"I am a Spanish teacher and have seen many different books. One of my students had this book so the other got the same book and I got 1 as well. I think it is OK, but for the price, it can't be beat."
4,not a grow guide,very funny and informative....full of light hearted information and silly stories....like talking with your stoned grand pa. I would recommend to any grand child.
5,She is my favorite!,"This was my first CD by this artist, and she truly is an artist. Even if her lovely voice is not typical of many fado singers, her selections and that very quality have made me a fan. I now have most of her recordings, but this one and Post Scriptum and Corpo Illuminado are my favorites. Mariza has become my second favorite. I also love her intensity."
5,"wonderful item, but i wish that it were larger!","this is an absolutely beautiful item, but i do wish that it were larger! the service was wonderful with this seller. thank you."
4,Fish.,"I ordered this item for my 50 gallon fish tank, it can really fast, and it was packaged nicely. It looks good in my fishtank, and my fish seen fairly happy with it. However it's kind of small, but it works just fine, overall I'm happy with this purchase."
4,Nice looking,"It is a little bigger than we thought and takes up about 1/2 of our gold fish bowl, but it is gool looking and gives the sence of treasure buried beneath the sea. Very fun!"
3,it is small,it is small but does the job. I would not recommend it for medium size fishes. I would recommend for smaller fishes.
1,Was very small,Was very small! Looks a lot bigger in pict! Didn't even end up using it ok for very small fish
5,Good quality decoration,"Decorations don't have to do much, but they shouldn't harm the fish. These ancient pot replicas are interesting, and the fish seem to enjoy them. In the month or so that I've had them they have not lost color, or peeled or hurt my fish in any way. I've got 3 different designs in 2 different tanks."
4,Get one for your Goy!,"I just picked this up and I haven't stopped laughing since I played it. Makes you want to yell ""Hey!"" through all the up-tempo numbers. All well executed numbers."
4,"Music is great, download expereince was horible.","I give the music four stars but Amazon's download process zero stars. After already being charged Amazon then asked what computer system was I using. I chose the system most like mine then an ""Amazon Installer"" application downloaded. The download would not not install so I called Amazon customer support. I won't bore you with all the details, but it took two calls to Amazon to get my MP3s available for download. Amazon was responsive and eventually the MP3s were made available for download, but I will think long and hard before I buy MP3s from Amazon again."
5,A Holiday Must Have!!!,Finally a holiday album that does it different. This collection is innovative and enjoyable. It is much more than a novelty. The quality of the music is exceptional. Mix it in with your other holiday CD's and enjoy!
5,Oy To The World - A Klezmer Christmas,"Oy Vey!!!!! Such a creation. My Yiddish friends think I am a crazy goy, but they love it too. Mazoltov"
4,OY TO THE WORLD,"very unusual and entertaining - I enjoyed the idea of blending the two musical styles and cultures. It has humor and beauty - for example: ""Santa Gay Gesunderheit"" is hilarious and ""Carol of The Bells"" is lovely."
1,Now you change the number of items in package?,"Was advertised as SEVENTY TWO PACKAGES PER BOX, and you substituted these boxes with only 48 pkgs. in them when you shipped to me. This particular store leaves a LOT to be desired. Save yourself some trouble -- shop elsewhere on Amazon. You will be very happy you did."
4,"All access pass to the ""General""",John Feinstein does a wonderful job of letting all of us spend a season with one of the most contriversial men in college basketball history. A must read for anyone wanting to know what Bob Knight is really like. I would recommend this to any college basketball fan.
4,Season on the Brink,"Excellent read, both about Bobby Knight and basketball. You don't need to understand or even, frankly, like basketball to become engrossed in the human drama of this story of players, coaches and an incredibly complex human being, Bobby Knight."
4,Bob Knight Unplugged,The best book with insight into Bob Knight and 1980s basketball. It is a sports book of the first order.
2,Blah,"His French stinks, really mediocre. My mom likes it. I ... wish I were ambivalent and I really don't like it. No feeling and quite robotic and cold."
4,Totally Julio,"I really like this CD. Being a long-time fan of his singing style and melodious voice, about anything he sings gets my attention though. Still, it's a nice combination of songs."
1,I have two words: Rumi/Shams,"In Way of Passion-a wonderful book-Harvey outdoes himself explaining why we need a teacher, and gushes over Rumi's devotion to Shams of Tabriz. Now all of sudden it's ""The Direct Path"", and we don't need teachers because Andrew's burned out with his. Gimmie a break... Enlightenment without a teacher? Good luck. As Rumi said: ""Whoever enters the Way without a guide will take a hundred years to travel a one-day journey . . . . Whoever undertakes a profession without a master becomes the laughing stock of city and town. Do not break with the prophet of your time! Do not rely on your own skills and footsteps! Though you be a lion, if you travel the Path without a guide, you will be a self-seer, astray and contemptible."""
4,Divine bubble baths,"I love all of Andrew Harvey's books (especially his novels...please write another novel, Andrew!). This one is as charming and erudite as all his other books. Having said that, I have one caveat: if you're a wicca/pagan/angel type, you should be forewarned that this book leans heavily toward Buddhist/Sufi/Christian/Hindu. As far as I could tell, he mentions wicca exactly once, and angels exactly once. My own ""Direct Path"" is a magpie nest of Greek goddesses (never mentioned), Scandinavian goddesses (never mentioned), guardian angels (never mentioned) and fairies (never mentioned?). So, although I enjoyed the book, it does not cover everyone's ""direct path"" -- but there are many little glittering bits (I especially like the advice about hot baths and disco dancing) that every magpie can use."
2,Adds no value to what a simple web search would yield,"In general, i advise to stay away from this book. I found it greatly lacking. Basically, the information provided is the same that you would get with a simple web search. Doesn't really add anymore.My recommendation: Save your money and don't bother."
1,Nothing pro in this book,"I really don't like this book, and don't understand the positive reviews it got. It's a vague and shallow overview of a bunch of ajax-related framework that will not help you get anything useful done. Buy only if you have money to waste. If you are a Java developer interested in Ajax, and looking for a useful book, try ""Practical Ajax Projects with Java Technology"". Not perfect but worth some money."
4,Good idea,Works great for me as long as I add a coozie (foam can holder) so it fits in my cup holder in my car. It is the only thing out there that I could find that works and does not cost alot.
2,I didn't like it,"Shipping was super fast and packaging was protective. However, I am disappointed in the product. Paper is thick, which is good, but I thought this was glossy because it says ""picture"". I also thought the picture was 11 x 14, but it is smaller. I do not recommend this poster or the 2 piece hanger. I think I'm going to take this off my wall."
2,Was good while it lasted,"I was given this as a gift by a friend who knows I squeeze my own lime juice and was looking for an electric juicer. It's been noisy, but effective.Failed today with both a flash and a pop after beginning the second lime. I'd be surprised if it handled more than 50 limes in its life.When I finish this review, I'm ordering a juicer attachment for my Kitchen Aid mixer."
2,DeLonghi Juicer,"Loved style and ease of use and cleanup of product, but it kept blowing the circut breaker when used. Sent back for a replacement."
1,waste of money,"Loved it while it worked. After using it less than 10 times the motor still turns but the juicer part doesn't. Sounds like the gears are stripped, probably has cheap plastic gears. You get what you pay for."
1,Not very long lasting,"I have only had this juicer for a few months and it stopped working today. I have probably only used it a dozen times. The last few times I used it, it got extremely loud and today, it simply stopped spinning. The juicer has nice features (i.e. the tray that catches the pulp), but it simply isn't durable. I can't believe I have to throw this thing away after so few uses. Very disappointing."
1,pooly made,This product isn't very sturdy. It also doesn't work well on larger citrus fruits. Mine literally broke into pieces when I waas trying to remove the piitcher from the base after very few uses. Not impressive at all.
1,Noisy & not dishwasher safe,"We trashed the juicer after less than a month of use. The machine makes an unbelievable racket, and the recepticle deformed when placed in the dishwasher. I know it says it is not dishwasher safe, but in 2010 one should be able to assume that kitched equipment is microwave and dishwasher safe."
1,Bad and worse,"I did not realize how horrible this juicer was until it finally died and I bought a new one. The whole time I used this juicer it was loud and ineffective. Buy the Black & Decker CJ525 CitrusMate Plus Citrus Juicer, it's cheaper, quicker, quieter and a million times better."
3,"Nice Idea, Inexpensive execution","Nicely designed, but inexpensively made. I would very much like to have one made of glass and metal. Especially the working parts. Motor and gears are plastic and prone to self-destruct over time and use. Having destroyed other, similar units, I use care. Two size spindle works great on lemons as well as grapefruit and oranges. Adjustable pulp strainer a plus. Removable decanter is nice but awkward to remove. All-in-all, a reasonable product for the money, but I'd rather have paid more for a higher quality machine."
4,Pulp problem,"This is a great citrus juicer. I was pleasantly surprised when I saw how well this juicer extracted nearly all the juice from my limes. My only problem with this device is it does not strain out all of the pulp. Other than that, this juicer would have received 5 stars from me."
1,"""A Pain to Use""","Although it does make juice, and is inexpensive, it rattles, shakes, and makes a ton of noise. It's such a clumsy design, that I'd rather use my non electric juicer over this one."
5,Awsome Unit,I was blown away when I received my T24 it was better made than I expected.($89) My friend said it sounds as good as his $299 Bose unit.It is so good that I felt compelled to get one more just because.
4,Sonic Impact T24 Portable iPod Speaker System,As some others have said the speaker system has great bass range but the higher range is a little empty. The speaks can be played very loud without a lot of distortion. My Hamon/Kardon computer speakers have better overall sound quality. For the price the T24 speaker system is not a bad buy but I will probably look at something with a better overall sound quality in the near future.Sonic Impact T24 Portable iPod Speaker System
2,Going to return,Nice design and look. Volume and sound is not great but good. Biggest complaint (and it's pretty big) is that it won't/can't charge my Ipod Touch 2nd generation. Second complaint; at low volumes there is a crackling/static noise. Definitely going to return even if I have to eat the original shipping cost.
3,Great Sound,I think that this product has great sound but the only thing I disliked about it is that it doesn't charge and when you put music it sounds a bit flaky with crazy noises but when you connect it through the back with the cord it sounds perfect.
2,"Nice sound, but issues....","Update January 2012: After less than a year of mild use, the left speaker is blown. A disappointing piece of junk.I use this unit to charge my 2G Ipod Nano but mainly as speakers for my laptop using the Aux in port. Very good sound quality: crisp highs and good bass response for a small unit. However, the remote control is cheap-feeling and has very limited range. Should you lose the remote or its battery dies, you're almost out of luck as the main unit has no on/off switch--not a good design--and rather annoying as the unit shuts down automatically after 10 minutes with no input. I have found, however, that if you pull the plug on the unit, wait 5 seconds, then plug it back in the unit powers back up. Overall an unsatisfying experience. I would not buy it again and don't recommend it."
4,Great dock for the price.,Sounds great. Remote angles can be tricky. Also the connector for the iPod has a tendency to disconnect at higher volumes. Sound reproduction is outstanding. For the price it's hard to beat.
4,OK,"We got this speaker system for our daughter to use with her iPod. Unfortunately, whenever she tries to charge her iPod, a message comes up that charging is not supported with this accessory. However, she likes the looks of it and can still use it as a speaker system."
2,Beware of False Product Description,"Good overall (sound & ease of use), but will not charge my IPOD 4th! I gave it a 2 star because I don't like being misled!"
3,Reluctant 3 stars,"Overall, this is a pretty silly and near-useless movie. The 2 female characters are likable and there is a great lunch conversation with the two betrothed leads and her totally idiotic and dysfunctional parents.That's pretty much it for any good points. Every male character in the movie is lame, unrealistic, unbelievable and unfunny. Kieran redeems himself in the end but that was so predictable they could have made the entire movie with just the opening scene, the lunch scene and the finale without losing anything useful. I don't even want to waste my time relating this movie's faults. Technically it's competent, but not very entertaining. You could find better ways to spend your time and money."
2,"So, So","Eh, this movie is ok if you're looking to kill some time. Overall I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. The girls are pretty, and the guys were mildly funny. Don't get your hopes up on this one."
2,Stupid,"It is really not very good. Bad writing, really bad acting and horrible directing. I expected it would be a bit better with Kaley Cuoco in it, but the script and direction were just too bad to overcome."
2,A Very Jeuvenile Movie,I watched this movie principally to see Kaley Cuoco. Unfortunately the roll she plays here does not provide a portrait that is complimentary to her. Although she is a principal of the movie her roll is not a critical one to the movie. The movie itself is poor and I did not find it entertaining.
1,worthless,"I really can not believe that people get paid to do this idiotic nonsense. The fact they people get paid a lot really boggles my mind. Whatever they did get paid, should be the new minimum wage, because anyone on the planet could put something like this together. No skill, talent, or intellect required."
