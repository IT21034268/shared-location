3,decent,"the sleeves in the case are ok its worth the price, i use it for my burnt game disc's and it holds up pretty good."
4,"Good deal, fast shipping",Can't really get too excited about this (because it was from a class a number of years ago) but Amazon did deliver a good quality copy for many $'s cheaper than the campus book store.
1,Another one bites the dust,"Just like everyone else, my Rowenta toaster also failed after approximately six months of use. All I get from it is that dreadful blip sound whenever I turn it on. I also had to suffer two Jasper Morrison kettles before giving up on that too. Stay away from the Jasper Morrison line of Rowenta products. They may look cool, but they are way way too expensive for a product that functions only adequately for it's ridiculously short life span."
1,Jasper Morrison Rowenta Toaster,"Horrible product...first one didn't function after 3 months, the replacement lasted about 6 months. Just continuously beeps. A $150 for a toaster that doesn't work? Rowenta should refund the purchase price for this product."
1,shame,"A beautiful and pleasing object that worked fine for about 18 months, then packed up when one of its heating elements went phut. (They're wired in series, so if one goes, the other is useless. Doh.) OK, I thought, it happens; let's just get a replacement element from Rowenta. Forget it. I was told by Rowenta's main agent that the toaster was ""obsolete"" and Rowenta were not supplying any spare parts for it. Attempts to contact Rowenta HQ proved fruitless.Be warned!"
1,The design and the company name completely fooled me.,"My two toasters lasted about 18 months. One I had in a rental unit does nothing but beep, the other beeps and will, if I persist, toast, but I fear it is just a matter of time before it gives up too. I spoke to Rowenta this am. They professed ignorance of any problem with their toaster, said they no longer sell it, and if it is older than 12 months tough luck - So there it is. A once respected company, whose irons and steamer I own, but in future will look around at the competition, loses its good name. Obviously a design flaw. I feel I have been completely taken in. (Incidentally this is my first written review. Thanks for giving me the opportunity to express my opinion)Rowenta-Morrison Collection: Toaster TL 9020"
1,"lovely design, terrible function","Like many others here, our Rowenta Jasper Morrison toaster failed after about a year of light use. Because we loved the look of it so much, we paid almost $80 to have it fixed, only to now have it fail again, after about a year. Rowenta should recall and replace all of these machine. They are worthless. What a shame."
2,"LOVE design, hate quality!","I bought this toaster, along with it the matching coffeemaker when it first came out. It broke within 1yr of use, which was less than once a week. There weren't any reviews out there at the time and having designed my kitchen/applicances with a similar modern feel and loving the design so much that I bought another one even though it was/is double the cost of other toasters. 3months past and the toast wouldn't go down. To add to the frustration, the stupid beeper went off every time I pressed it to lower or raise the toast. I had to use a wooden spoon to wiggle it up and down. It broke after about another 3mths of this. Why hasn't Rowenta tried to fix the problem? Its been, over 3yrs?, since this came out. I would have rated it 1 star but gave it 2 because I love the simplicity of the design.I would not recommend at all!!!"
1,Low Quality. Poor Warranty. Horrible Customer Service. Great Design.,"I bought the Jasper Morrison coffee maker and toaster when they came out because they're such a beautiful design. The toaster was a problem from day one. I contacted Rowenta about the non-stop ""Bip"" the toaster made, and was told it was not an issue. Soon after my warranty expired, the toaster gave up the ghost. I paid to mail this $150 toaster in to the service center only to find out it will now cost $83 to fix it. I'm furious with Rowenta. After it completely failed, I did research online, and found out that the problem I was experiencing is very common. Rowenta didn't disclose this, and let the warranty period expire. Jasper Morrison's warning about electrical failure on all of these Rowenta appliances is shocking too.I am now off the Rowenta brand. My responses from Rowenta customer service have been incredulous: they could care less customers are not happy."
5,little rippa,"yeah like the rest of the reviews on here absolutly loved it, stumbled on to these guys on fat wreck chords,(the only music label I trust) Pure unadulterated pop punk that doesn't make you feel ashamed to enjoy them, infact i think these guys are one of my favorite bands going around with a sound i will never tire of hearing, cant wait for the new album out in a month or so."
4,Nice but a pain at the same time,"This gate takes time and effort to install ... a lot of screws but unlike how some have said you dont have to make a pilot hole, just makes it easier. The gate is very sturdy and I think very nice looking, however it is a tricky one to open and close. The first couple times I couldnt do it at all but once you get the ""feel"" of it its simple. Only problem is when other people are over they can never figure it out. It is also tall so basically impossible to step over. I can however open this gate with one hand ... like I said before you just have to get the ""feel"" of it.Overall I am very happy with this gate because I needed it for a larger opening. I wouldnt recommend it if you want to use it for a regular size opening though. Since it is a little more complex I would only buy it if you need the wider gate. It is very durable and nice though.Good Luck!"
5,great gate and affordable!,"We've been using this gate for approximately 6 weeks now to block a 58"" space between our living room and kitchen. Despite having to drill 16 holes for the screws, it was still installed in under 15 minutes. I don't understand the negative reviews regarding the latching mechanism. It couldn't be easier. My disabled 65 year old mother has no problem closing and opening this gate. Although the gate feels a little flimsy, my daughter has shaken it pretty hard and it has held up just fine. Definitely worth the $40."
1,Don't buy it!,"I had my husband put this up- we needed to add our own 1 x 4 wood to screw in the gate to the wall- their screws are lame so we used our own wood screws too-only to find this gate is way too hard to open/close. We took it down and returned it. This was for a kitchen entrance where there is high traffic, and each time we go through this gate, we had to be very patient, for it is wobbly and you need to latch it shut - have it aligned just right and it is soooo frustrating! The sliding door sticks and gets stuck every time so you need to push and pull to get it to slide open or shut.Once you can get it to slide open, it swings out which is great, but don't waste your time and money!"
3,"Great, but.....","This item is NOT MENT FOR DRY WALL INSTALLATION! Don't waist your time, I tried it and it doesn't work!"
1,Hate It!!,"This gate is awful. It's a good price but not at all easy to open and close. My older children have trouble opening it and closing it. Lining it up and then having to push pretty hard to get it latched is to difficult for the older kids. I would not recommend this gate. The Hands Free gate is so much easier, I just wish it went in bigger openings."
3,you get what you pay for,"My husband and I didn't want to pay a fortune for something we're not going to use for very long; that was a mistake! Simply put, you get what you pay for. We bought two of these gates and we have to open and close them often. One of them is fairly simple and no trouble at all. The other one is a nightmare! We now have to keep a hammer close by so we can bang it shut. Too say the least it is not very practical or convenient with two sleeping children. Instead of paying more money up front, we now get to pay more when we move soon and leave these gates behind."
1,Horrible gate,"Although the gate was not hard to install, it was nearly impossible to get it to latch, even when aligned properly. The one time I could get it to latch, it was very flimsy. I have taken it down and I am returning it. I am not going to fight with this gate for the next several years. It is cheap for a reason."
1,mom of multiples,"This gate is awful!! As a mom of multiples you could not work this gate with 1 in your arm, 1 on your leg, and 1 crawling right for you. I couldn't open it easily and it was not stable with children hitting and leaning on it. It was easy to put up but I was happy to get it down."
4,works for dogs too!!,"we have 4 dogs in the house ranging from 52 pounds to 180 pounds. we must keep the two girls separated at all times and had to gate between livingroom and kitchen. large opening and high traffic area. yes- this gate does take a little time to install and isnt the fastest to open/close. however- it stands up very well to our ""kids"" climbing on it, running into it, looking over it, etc..... the puppy did manage to crack the bottom latch area when he came at a full run and tried to jump over it- he missed....at that time he was around 90 pounds and not real coordinated. the gate did release that time and the bottom edge cracked but we have continued to use it for approx another full year with no problems. we are looking to replace this one after a year and a half of VERY hard use- but are getting another one just like it!"
2,Not for climbers !,"Loved this gate until my son .. 17 months.. learned to climb ! He puts his toes in the gate and just climbs up and over it !It is attached to the kitchen counter, so he climbs up the gate on the counter and, well.. you can imagine the rest !So if you have a climber I would recommend one that has the long slats vs one that has ""holes"" in it for their toes .."
3,Great for large openings but Hard to Close,"I have a 5 foot opening between my kitchen and living room and this is the only product I could find that fits. The gate is sturdy as my 1 year old is constantly pulling on it and it doesn't budge. However, I constantly need to let my eight year old in and out as well as any house guests. It is difficult to figure out how to open it (push down then pull up) as well as open itself. I wish there was an easier gate that would fit such a large opening."
2,Parent Proof Too???,"I really am not happy with this gate. It is hard to open, takes two hands, and just seems cheaply made. It doesn't slide easily, so if you don't have all the panels open, watch that it doesn't pinch your figers!Spend a bit more money and get a different gate, this was one of the only ones at the store when I bought it. I wish I had waited."
3,Sturdy but cannot get bottom and top latches to meet,I ordered this gate to use for my 80 lb puppy. It is a sturdy gate but neither myself nor my husband could get the top and bottom latches to meet. We have been disappointed with this product.
4,supergate V22 62wx31H,Service was great and quick - product good - had it before but wore out. Wished it would be a little less expensive.
3,You'd have to be a giant to clear this one!,"I just bought this gate to keep my 9 month old in the living room. I chose this one because I have a 50"" doorway to block off. The installation was fairly easy, I did have to remove some moulding to get a square fit. I didn't find the latch to open/close very easy to manuver, my husband and I prefer to hop the gates anyway. When I went to step over the gate, I stopped with one leg on each side, I was nearly stuck! I am 5'8"", but the 31"" height of the gate was too high for either of us to walk over. Plus, it was even too high for any of our 3 cats to clear without biting the dust. It was very inconvienent for a high traffic area."
5,Great gate for the price and installation at an angle,"On one side of this gate has wall hinge which makes it very flexible if one needs to install at a slight angle or swing to either direction. Also, gate has no top or bottom so one can mount wall hinge close to the side that swing to desired direction. Another feature I like about this gate is it can be completely removed off the hinge for storage or get it out of the way. So happy I finally found this gate that fit my need perfectly."
2,Impossible latch,We were happy to finally find a gate that fits the irregular opening at the top of our stairs for such a great price. The gate installed quickly and everything seemed great until we tried to open the latch. There is nothing easy about this latch and even my husband--who is a pro with anything even slightly mechanical--had trouble and agreed the value of the gate wasn't worth the fight we had to go through to open it. We had to press down on the tiny square latch release with all our might and then wiggle the gate until it popped off the mounting! I couldn't imagine trying to open the gate while holding a baby!
4,Great Once You Get the Hang of It,"We have an open staircase to our basement that is wider than a typical doorway. Even though we don't extend this gate near as far as it can go, it is great for our needs. I especially like how the gate can swing in either direction. Although I can open the gate with one hand, it really helps to use both hands to close it. It took awhile to get the hang of closing it, and only now, if I'm lucky, can I close it when I am holding a basket of laundry under one arm. But I am confident that this gate is secure, even when my daughter pulls up on it and tries to shake it."
3,Nice gate but hard to close with a baby in hand,"This is a nice sturdy gate but if you are going to close it while your hands are full with an infant....FORGET IT!!!This gate makes me mad every morning because I cannot latch it shut with my son in my arms. Put him down? I could but why am I the one inconvenienced when I should be able to get this gate closed with no problem?The slats do not slide back in place easily either. I have to pull the gate out and slide them back in to get it to close.Yes, it's a good gate and you can buy additional pieces to swing gate to another wall and latch but.....I have 2 evenflo secure solution gates that are wonderful and I am going to buy one of them in a larger size. They are the same price as this gate and I love the 2 I have. They have one latch at the top that you squeeze and lift up on to open the gate and look really nice. I have had no problem with the hardware or the gate and feel they are much better for me and not as bulky as this gate is."
3,Reliving the 80's in rock,"This is an album that I always enjoyed. I first heard it back in the early 80's but couldn't bring myself to spend the money on the vinyl. Later, when CDs came into fashion this was one that had moved off of my ""hot"" list to buy. Now, 20+ years later I'm catching up on a lot of the old music that framed the 80's for me. I bought the CD used and it was well worth the cash I payed. I wouldn't spend $20 for it but under $10 and you've got a winner. Burnin For You is worth the price of admission. If that is the only song on the album you are interested in then go by the mp3 single. If you, like me, was a teenager in the 1980's then this whole album will probably resonate with you. It's different and not for everyone but for me I enjoy having it in my collection. I rated it a 3 our of 5 because the whole album is not great, but it is good. Enjoy!"
3,cult classics,these guys were on drugs obviously cuz this cd felt cursed. wierd how burning up was the only sane sound
5,A pleasure,"It's generally agreed that Blue Oyster Cult's albums became weaker and spottier after their breakthrough Agents of Fortune in 1976, but Fire of Unknown Origin ('81) is one record that can safely be mentioned alongside their early classics. In my opinion, at least. Some feel that the record is overproduced and drenched in synthesizers, but I think the arrangments are tasteful and bring out, rather than hinder, the good points in the songs. This album has a somewhat ""darker"" feel than their early work. Tracks like 'Veteran of the Psychic Wars', 'Sole Survivor', 'After Dark' and 'Joan Crawford' (with its rousing chorus of ""Joan Crawford has risen from the grave"") show something of a menacing stance, but the music is also melodic and driven by catchy guitar riffs and sublime vocals. And of course there is 'Burnin for You' one of the band's most popular songs. Needless to say, anyone interested in BOC should give this one a listen."
5,BOC at the top of their game,"I feel BOC peaked with this album. One of my favorite bands, they started to decline after this release. That said, this is a masterpiece.The good side of all this is I get to see them in concert at more intimate venues for far less now that they are not a major act anymore. It's a little consolation, anyway."
3,Real Heavy Metal,"Ever see the original Heavy Metal Movie? Veteran of a Thousand Psychic Wars was on the sound track, but pretty much all of the songs follow the movie- It'll help you understand Vengence, the Pact."
2,2 stars for 2 songs,"...Well when I saw 'Heavy Metal The Black and Silver', and 'Burnin For You', I thought wowsta I know they're awesome songs, wonder if the rest of the album has that vibe!? For me, it doesn't, it's benign and doesn't groove at all like the songs I mentioned.I tend to like the 'Death Valley Nights', 'Don't Fear the Reaper', 'Godzilla' type stuff. You should listen to the little samples on here first to check (I didn't so the cd goes in my B-class collection ie 1 or 2 good songs on the album, as opposed to A-class masterpieces like Mountain's ""Climbing"", The Beatles' ""Revolver"", George Harrison's ""All Things Must Pass"", The Stooges' ""Raw Power"", Wings' ""Band on the Run"", Lennon's ""Imagine"", Lynyrd Skynyrd's ""Skynyrd's First and... Last"". See where I'm getting at here? Snobbery? Seems so :) Sorry but really this album doesn't hold half a candle to the stuff I mentioned!"
5,"A brilliant, highly creative piece of work! Classy B.O.C.!","This release is way phenomenal, and explores new ground for B.O.C.! Very creative and original in its time, and still to this day stands the test of time. To the person who gave this a one star, you surely need to get the wax out of your ears! This release is a stylistic gem!!!"
4,An '80's Classic!,"This 1981 release is one of Blue Oyster Cults finest efforts.I remember seeing the video for the first single ""Burnin' For You"" in the early days of MTV I was hooked and went out and bought the album (that's what we bought back in the old days before cd's, kiddies). I recently found the disc at a local music chain and quickly snatched it up.The disc opens with the title track followed by ""Burnin' for You"" and ""Veteran of the Psychic Wars"" a track fans of the animated sci-fi classic movie ""Heavy Metal"" will recognize.It's a great flowing disc with well written songs throughout. Check it out!"
1,stick with a greatest hits cd,"I just got this & don't like it at all. I agree with the other reviewer who said it sounds like a ""cheap teen flick"" soundtrack. If u want an original studio album of B.O.C.'s, I'd highly recommend ""Agents of Fortune."" If u just like some of their songs you've heard on the radio, I would recommend just buying 1 of their greatest hits albums, with several to pick from."
4,A really great BOC album,"This is really one of the great BOC albums. Many really great songs here including Veteran of the Psychic Wars (excellent song), Burning for You, Sole Survivor, After Dark, and Fire of Unknown Origin. Heavy Metal & Joan Crawford are a little kooky but aren't bad. Skip the short-sighted compilations and get this album instead. You won't be disappointed. Hopefully they will remaster it soon, but the sound quality is really quite good already."
4,NEVER THE SAME AGAIN,"FROM ""FIRE OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN"" TO ""DON'T TURN YOUR BACK"" THIS CD IS PLEASURABLE, RELENTLESS MUSIC FROM THE SULTANS OF METAL...BLUE OYSTER CULT.1981 BEGINS THE TIME THAT B.O.C. WILL NEVER BE THE SAME AGAIN. THIS WAS THE YEAR THAT ALBERT BOUCHARD WAS DISMISSED FROM B.O.C.ALBERT WAS THE ""LUNATIC GENIUS"" OF THE BAND WITH HIS SONGS, VOCALS, LIGHT DRUMMING...HE WAS THE ""KEITH MOON"" OF B.O.C. IT SEEMS THE BEST ALBUMS OF THIS BAND WERE THE ONES WHERE EVERY MEMBER HAD A SONG CONTRIBUTION ON IT AND THIS IS ONE OF THEM."
3,Maxwell House - Maxwell House,"Another day, another Max Brennan alias. This time, it's Maxwell House, and his eponymous debut goes in more of a house direction, but still with that crazed jazz that made his name(s). ""Sparticas"" alternates between crazed freneticism and mysterious downtempo. ""River Karnack"" is more strictly downtempo, while ""Brogal Frets"" has some bass strums that give it a warm pulse. ""Hilton Box"" has that funk which we crave so much. Overall, Maxwell House is reminiscent of his work as Fretless AZM, but it has its own unique qualities as well -- but for purposes of comparison, it rates a middling Fretless AZM album."
4,"Mouth-Watering,","The recipes in this book made my mouth-water and the Taylors' beginning story made me smile-- A cute introduction to the Taylor Family of Men Chefs:How It All Began, is a Must Read by anyones standards!"
5,What a gifted family of men chefs!,"I bet growing up in the Taylor household must have been a lot of fun--GREAT story about the family of men chefs and how it happened to be--4 generations of cooks, wow! -- The recipes are really easy to follow and yummy--If you are in the mood for a little something different then this is the book for you--it's loaded with unique recipes for all kinds--a few for the healthy eater as well--I'm happy to suggest this book for anyone who enjoys cooking great meals."
4,",But it's features are not transparent","I went looking for a new digital and changed my mind when I saw this cute transparent model. 3.5 quarts is fine for 2 or 3, maybe four. Being clear down to the cooking bowl helps out and helps keep the lid on too. I like this unit and would suggest it to anyone, there are two points to cover first the glass cooking crock does not have any tabs or handles to hold onto while lifting the hot-full of food out to the base so the idea of taking the glass crock out and taking it to the table is not really an option unless it is 3/4 full of less. Second, it has burned a small amount to the bottom of the crock even on the low setting. Avoid that by rubbing a little oil on the bottom or put some root veg. in first, who cares if one small chunk gets a little over done."
2,off-gasses chemical smells,"I bought this glass cooker after hearing about trace amounts of lead in traditional ceramic glazed cookers. Using this the first time, I walked into the kitchen and the entire room and living room REEKED of off-gassing chemicals. Electronics and pthalates from the wiring and electronics were cooking along with my food. After some time, I realized, this is way more dangerous to my health than trace amounts of lead that may never leech out of a normal crock pot. In fact, my Rival slow cooker never off-gassed at all. THis Elite Gourmet would take at least months to off-gas. Spending an hour with this product actually made me ill. I had to toss my food and turn on an exhaust fan. it took an hour before the smell gone from my living room."
5,Book of James,"I have literally listened to this cd over and over--I can never get enough of it. If I'm in a bad mood, I simply put on The Book of James, and my soul is instantly uplifted."
4,Scotland's U2?,"This is a solid collection. I've got the 1990 release, and while it sounds fine, I suspect the import sounds better as it's remastered. Any casual fan should be pleased with the selections. I see nothing essential missing. My only real complaint is with their biggest hit ""In A Big Country"". The song is a classic, but here the intro is chopped off and kicks in immediately with the drums. The edit keeps the song from building in the beginning, losing some of its drama. I suppose some people may not even notice, but.This is a fine place to begin your Big Country collection, however I'm tempted to say many people could just get their debut album The Crossing. It's available remastered with bonus tracks. Sounds good on my turntable too."
3,"Smart, but faulty","Ozick has constructed a remarkably intelligent narrative, but in the end, her portrait of Bruno Schulz is more interesting than her protagonist. Even her supporting cast is more dimensional and fully rendered than her main character. Ozick displays a beautiful wit, but her story leaves us begging for something more engaging"
3,Promising but in the end unfulfilling,"While I can appreciate, from a distance, the aspects of this book others could use to cite it as a great piece of writing, I found myself frustrated by the narrative balance that Ozick used to tell its story. I didn't feel like there was any spot where i could truly jump into the text and hold on. The characters outside of the main character were all very apathetic and one-dimensional, and i felt like the actions Lars (the main character) took towards them, and which were supposedly the driving points of the novel, were not satisfying emotionally due to the simple fact that I had no place from which to appreciate them. For a 140 page book, i think it was a task Ozick shouldn't have sought out to take by striving to cram so many esoteric and subjective aspects of text at the expense of character or plot development. A dissapointing and unsatisfying read."
4,Alchemy and Science?,"Pamela Smith's work, ""The Business of Alchemy"", has a rather startling thesis. We all know that throughout history alchemy and empirical science have been considered seperate, and as soon as such men as Newton and Darwin came along, psuedosciences such as alchemy disappeared lost all credability. Right? Wrong. As Pamela Smith explains, that notion is ahistorical. The only problem with this book is that it is boring. I had trouble finishing even a single sentances without being bored. In conclusion, she should write more books about the history of science in Early Modern Europe. Over and out!"
1,"CHEAP, USELESS BATTERY","This battery was good for exactly one charge before it would not hold any more charges. I have learned my lesson about ""bargain"" batteries. If the price seems too good to be true, do not buy the product."
5,Unbelievable,Finally! Something on television that requires more than a casual glance between commercials. I am already counting the days for Season 3 to begin.
3,Not as good as the first season,"The first season was much better, The characters more more likable and there was less unnessary violence. Season 2 seamed like it was trying doing things just for shock value."
3,Hell on Wheels,It is well done. However the violence and atrocities are over the top which keeps this from being a 4 or 5 star rating.
2,it had potetial,I'd have enjoyed the show if Hollywood hadn't tried to shove another interracial love affair into it. The story wasn't bad and the production value was decent. Despite its positives I couldn't finish it.
1,No sound,No sound on roku. Love this show. Paid 3 bucks to watch and no sound. Please fix this. And 3 bucks per episode is to much.Problem fixed. Thanks
5,Hell on Wheels has set the bar high for television series,"I've watched both seasons repeatedly, the perfect TV series fro Hi Definition viewing & Boise Speakers surround sound. I believe this TV series will be taught in college film classes as a new genre in television. It is truly a first of its kind in television drama, and this series has set the bar high for television producers. We, the viewing audience, are hungry for more like this. I personally will be crushed if they don't continue with a 3rd season of Hell on Wheels!"
2,Not really interested anymore.,"It was good at first, then I found myself repeatedly walking away from the TV to go do other more interesting things. I dont look to see this show return for another season"
2,Got bored quickly.,"This show seemed interesting at first, but it just became boring after only a few episodes. I think if I still had cable and didn't have to pay per episode, I might watch it when nothing else was on. But at this price, it just isn't worth it to me."
3,Slow start to this season's shows,"So I got hooked on Hell on Wheels last year when we had the privilege of watching on DISH and AMC. This year things changed as you know with DISH dropping AMC in some sort of hissy fit. Now you have the chance to get all the episodes from Amazon and watch them at your leisure over ROKU or other viewing means, for about $1.99 each. I have to say I am still awaiting something to happen after watching the first 2 episodes. There is a lot of grunting and dirt and mean glances and, did I mention, dirt. But not much has developed and it is starting to get a little boring for me at least. Maybe things will pick up but as for now, watch Breaking Bad and wait for Walking Dead to return."
5,Hell on Wheels,My husband and I Love this show! The first season was great and the second is even better. Lots of drama and action.
1,Not what I thought I had purchased!,I thought I was buying the series on dvd. I had no idea this was on my computer only. I tried to cancel the purchase immediately but was given no way to do so. I will be weary about ordering anything again!!! I won't be using this purchase at all and would like to return it if possible.
3,bloody,"Nauseated, but couldn't stop watching for fear of losing a crucial little piece to the story that might explain certain circumstances down the road."
5,hell on wheels,Hell on wheels season 2 is as great if not better than season 1 and having it on Amazon Instant Video is also a great thing. The only complaint I have is that I have trouble understanding some of the speech in movies and televsion shows so I always have the closed captions on so I don't miss anything. I wish that the Amazon Instant Videos could get the closed captions feature on the tool bar.
5,Hell on Wheels Season 2,Absolutely loved it. the show is extremely well written. The cast is superb. I really hope they continue the show & the new writers are as good as the previous ones.
3,Plot twist,"Season Finale: The show was still as visually appealing as ever, however, the deaths of a both a major and minor character in these last episodes may make some loyal watchers less likely to tune in for the next season. These episodes were very aptly named."
5,Season Two Has Been Money!!,"We thought that season one really drug on and almost quit watching the show. Season two really picked it up a notch and Hell on Wheels is easily one of our favorite shows. The acting, cinematography and character development has been great. It does a great job of portraying the building of the railroad along with some good old fashioned story contrast to boot. It all builds up to a great and surprising two hour season finale."
4,Hell On Wheels Finale,Great story. I hope this doesn't end the series. It did take a long time to download but it was worth it.
5,WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The best show on tv right now! Great soundtrack and set quality is out this world! Common is my new favorite actor! I absolutely love this show, Im cheating on Breaking Bad with Hell on Wheels but hey same tv station right? Do yourself a favor and watch this show!!!"
5,Best Western series since Tombstone,"Ever since the inception of this series I have been caught up in the multiple plot lines and the character development of this richly layered, action-filled Western, and with every episode I find myself thinking, yes, this is what it must have been like back in those days immediately after the Civil War when the push was on to build a railroad linking the east and the west of this vast country. It is all I can do to wait for each successive episode, and it's nice to know that if I chance to miss an episode, I can pick it up from Amazon. Kudos to all involved in bringing this compelling script to life."
3,Not as good as 1st season,"If you liked the first season this good to watch, but I think it lost a bit of luster. Is it worth $17? I'd prob wait to watch it on Netflix."
4,spoiler alert,liked the series but hated the ending. The relationship between Lily and ...what was his name..Banock? was the most interesting and now that is done. writers could have done better with the story line in a couple of aspects but it is what it is and overall it was good.
5,This series is just great,"This series just keeps getting better and better. We can't wait until the next episode. The acting is so real, it's hard to remember that these are ACTORS!"
5,Realistic Western,"I am a true John Wayne western fan and have all of his westerns and many others.But Hell On Wheels is probably much, much closer to the true west and the storybehind it's development. It is a gutsy, down-to-earth western saga at its best.I bought Season One in its entirety and will do so with Season Two upon completion.Great stuff!"
5,Fantastic,"The show has everything you want. Ups and downs, excitement, love, and the feel of the Old West that has been somewhat lost. Totally worth every penny."
5,Gina,I cannot wait for the third series. The second series was great and exciting.The actor was very nice looking. He is great. I hope the third series isjust as good as the first and second. I have both series. Hurry up I amwaiting for the third of the series.
4,Solid...similar to Deadwood with a little more gunplay,"The first two episodes took a while to draw me in. After that I became intrigued and have enjoyed following the show. Beautiful landscapes, a compelling story and solid characters."
5,Best Show on TV,"This Season ""Hell ON Wheels"" has been the best ever. I love this show. The Lord's Day sure changed the way you thought the show was going. It was so good. New Twist and a new Cullen. Loved it.I cannot wait every week to watch this show. By far the best series on TV. Cannot wait for Season 3."
4,"Not Deadwood, but well done, anyway","AMC has created an intrinsically interesting premise peopled with powerfully drawn characters. The money AMC spent is obvious on the screen, showing the American West, which is unmistakable for any other scenery. The screenplay does justice to all the different points of view, avoiding most stereotypical points of view. Worth watching."
5,Great series,"There's nothing not to like here. It's amazing that Anson Mount hasn't had a major role in movies before this. If you liked Season 1, you'll want to keep going!"
5,I'm Hooked!,There are very few shows that really keep me wanting more and this is one of them. Can't wait for season 3!
5,Awesome,"Loved this, I am a fan of this TV series. I have the first season and just love the second season."
5,Great series,"My husband wanted to watch this, I ended up loving it! Great series and I can't wait for the next season."
2,Not nearly as good as Season 1.,"Season 1 is strong and dense. Season two is flabby and padded with longing looks. I would give season two a pass, but check out the first season. It's very well done -- but still not as good as Deadwood."
5,The inside story on polygamy,This is a good read on a subject that is very controversial at the moment. It gives great insight into the daily lives of polygamists and sheds light on their beliefs. The author talks about her childhood and her relationship with her numerous siblings and mothers. Her father is a huge influence on her life and it is clear he was an influential member of their religious group. This book is definitely worth reading.
1,I didn't like this one...,"I didn't like this book very well. It gave too much history and not enough current events. I have read the history of polygamy over & over & over and would like to read current events. There wasn't too much to read about current events in this book. If you want the history, this book's for you. She's a good writer but I've had their history crammed down by throat enough. I get it!"
3,To much History,"I didn't care as much for this book, there was just to much history. Was a little boring."
4,Great,"Great feeder. I have had one for @15 years and everyone loves it, birds and family alike.I got this one as a gift for my son and Granddaughter."
2,Not what I expected.,"I was somewhat put out with this product. Looking at the picture, and the description, one would think this to be one sturdy bird feeder. Oh, but not so. The tubs are supported by the top, which when removed, allows the tubs to come undone from the little niches that hold them in place. Not particularly good when one is fighting a bag of birdseed. Plus, the bird would have nothing to do with it. Okay, I'm just saying...when I had a gold one, the birds were all over it. This one sat in my backyard for two weeks and I only recall seeing maybe two or three birds on it. Perhaps I have picky birds."
4,Insightful and poetic,"I first discovered this book 12 years ago, while writing a formal credo for a religion class in college, and I found the book invaluable. I had to fight the urge to quote whole pages at a time. Not only did Mr. Miller explain the complexities of a polytheist-centered world-view clearly, but he did so with a poet's light touch. The only regret I had at the time, and have now, is that I was reading the book with a deadline hanging over my head, and could not luxuriate in his writing as much as I wanted (it is only this fact that makes me uncomfortable giving the book a perfect ""5 star"" rating).It is a great sorrow that this book is out of print... But perhaps it will be reissued one day."
5,Great stuff,"This is a really good collection of early Sons of the Pioneers. The tracks are variable in style, but all are good, and many of the songs are unavailable or hard to find elsewhere. While not as definitive as the Country Music Hall of Fame recording (a must), this is very satisfying. I strongly recommend these earlier recordings, with real-life accompaniment by accoustic instruments, over the more recent, end-of-career versions with their overly slick orchestral accompaniment. Worth the price, though stingily filled."
4,leave in scalp treatment,"Fast shipping, tried product and has a soothing feel to the scalp. Thanks, D.Storm"
2,Didn't work.,"I have terrible dandruff. I have seen two dermatologists for prescription medications which did not work. I have tried almost every over the counter treatment and none of them worked. This product was my last attempt, and I used it as directed for two weeks. And again, it did NOTHING to control my dandfuff. I wish I could write a glowing report, but this product was a waste of time and money."
3,"works, but really huge!","This case is surprisingly huge! I bought this one because my Flak Jackets are pretty large, and they don't fit in normal glasses cases. This case is great for protecting the glasses, but it's so big that I can't really carry it in a pocket, jacket, or laptop bag. I can only fit the case in my largest backpack, so that's the only time I use it, and only for long trips. For short trips, I just have to keep the glasses in my pocket because this case is too huge to carry.I wish there were a better hard case that was designed for the size of the Flak Jacket, and not so much bigger that it can't fit in a pocket."
4,over average,the product arrived in very good conditions and it look like the same as the picture. other thing is the time it took to arrived at my home
5,"Solid, good quality,","I love it, I bought a nice pair of Oakley's and I am hoping to make this pair last a lot longer than the last. Previous pair was sat on by your's truly.Should last for a while, good solid construction, hinge is nice and long, interior is slightly padded in a nice cloth. Gonna run mine through a polisher to make it bright and shiny."
5,Oakley Vault,"This is an original Oakley case. When you invest money in a quality eye wear, it is justified to buy the case. Great product both in looks and quality."
3,I expected better from Oakley...,"The item is just like what it's in the picture but what you don't know is that the case doesn't closely that securely as you expected with your regular spectacles case.5 star for the autencity of the product and product delivery4 stars for design3 stars for price (a little overpriced for that quality, I expected better from Oakley, I will prefer my Flak jacket case that came with my shades over this, despite it not made of metal)2 stars for build quality (it feels like a rejected or half-finished product from the factory in China). The spring hinge feels flimsy, thus doesn't close tightly or properly, there's a few mm gap even after I close the case."
1,Not for travellers,"Much bigger than it looks. Not for travellers, especially on planes. Looks like a huge pill capsule. It takes up too much room even for my car."
5,Just what I needed,I was wondering why Oakley doesn't include hard cases for every sunglass purchase...then found out that they sell them separately. You can't use just any hard case with your Oakley's.
2,Buyer Beware! Cheap Plastic.....,These are NOT metal. They are cheap plastic and not worth the $. They are not rugged. They are of average quality and maybe worth $12...
2,Not what was ordered,"The book was delivered quickly, but it was not the edition that was ordered. I could tell by the cover of the book. It looks like a ""Bait and Switch."" When contacted via e-mail about a return or sending the ordered edition, there was no reply. I am not a happy reader now."
3,"Amazon Service (or Lack Thereof), Not Reviews of Book","I was going to order the newer version (2009) of this anthology because I have the 2003 one. However, after reading about the problems with receiving the correct version, I'll pass. Maybe there should be separate sets of star ratings: one set for the book itself and one set for amazon's service in sending it."
2,Not quite what I thought,"It did come quickly and was in good condition, but the picture in the advertisement was of the third edition (the one I needed for the class) but in fact I received the first edition of the book. Which my professor (also the editor of the book) said would not do, so at the end I had to go buy another copy at my bookstore. I was very upset that the picture on amazon did not match the book."
3,Introduction to Sociology,If you are taking Ms. Even's class at South College... DON'T BYE THIS BOOK! You don't need it. We looked at it once! Everything you need to know is written on the board.
3,You Go Girl!,"This book is a great gide to any female teen. It has quotes and tips from real girls, and is relly fun to read. Most girls need a little gidence and words of wisdom as they are teenagers, and whats better then getting that from girls going through the same thing, just like you? It is a great and fun book-HAVE FUN!"
1,do not buy,do not buy this item it looks very cheap and i dint'n get all my stuff it looks like u could buy this at dollar general for a dollar i pay $17.85 for this item
1,Didn't Work Out of the Box,"Received mine last week, didn't work at all. Appeared to power up and get a GPS fix but couldn't identify any object. Upgraded the program using the included disk but no change in behavior. Liked the way idea of this device as opposed to the SkyScout but sent it back this morning and decided to stay with the SkyScout. I was going to give the SkyScout to my son if the Meade device worked because I generally prefer Meade equipment but decided to just return this one and wait to see if the reported problems I see on other sites are corrected down the road."
1,Waste of Money!,"Mine was bad out of the box too. Has been back to Meade for OVER a month now and every time I call Meade they say ""We'll get that shipped out to you tomorrow"". I had problems with my Celestron SkyScout when I first got it but Celestron got it back to me in about a week and it's been GREAT since then. Save your money and buy a SkyScout from Celestron and avoid Meade. I know I will from now on and I own several of thier scopes."
1,Don't waste your time or money. You'll be disappointed!,"Received the unit for my birthday. Very excited at first. Went through a tedious setup process. Realized that the unit was built very poorly with switches that don't seem to be quite right, either recessed too deeply into the device or not as responsive as they should be. Never could get a GPS lock after several attempts. Put in date/time/location manually. mySky was way off on identifying objects. Attempted to update the included SD card per the manual but the ""Programming failed."" From that point forward, the unit never functioned again. I am returning it for a refund."
1,does not work,Has never acquired a gps fix. Cant identify or locate the moon. Batteries go dead overnight with unit off. Meade customer service is not helpful.
3,Prone to problems,"MySky worked well when I used it initially and for about two years thereafter, though I didn't use it all that often. It would be the hit of the evening at star parties, especially with the younger folks. Recently I took it out with new batteries to use and it won't even turn on no matter what I do, and of course it's out of warranty. I don't think it's worth the cost to fix and I suppose I will just junk it. A device such as this should be built and designed to last a long time and be able to stand up to use, even the gentle use it has had. Very disappointing for me!"
1,I should have paid attention to the reviews,"Out of the box, the device does not work. It freezes in the midst of the effort to communicate with GPS satellites and establish time and location. Tried it about 20 times all of the ways that the documentation specified. Meade support is only available during business hours (when I am working, not playing with cool gadgets). One must have a return number obtained from Meade before sending it back. Great concept. Horrible execution."
1,What the ****???,"I bought my mySky a couple of years ago, and it worked fine except for a month ago when it erred out completely. The screen pop-up advised that I contact Meade for an RMA#.I just called Meade and wad told sorry, but they do not support the mySky any longer. They will not repair or replace. I'm steamed, as I paid $400 to Amazon for it.I asked the Meade support guy Well, if you don't repair or replace am I stuck with it with no recourse."" He did not answer me."
1,Whoa! what a HUGE Bummer,"Unfortunately, we were ones who paid the 400 bucks for this POS from Meade. Meade seems to be hit or completely miss on their products... and usually a big miss on service. This thing sort of wanted to work out of the box, then decided it didn't want to. It won't find jack in the sky. I own 4 telescopes, and a couple are Meade. So, I'm not going to put them down completely. This device however shouldn't have ever hit the floor. I hope I'm saving someone a big headache and a few bucks. I thought of selling mine on ebay, but I'd just be doing something wrong. Basically, I've got a 400 piece of trash."
1,Failed out of the box,"I also had a failed unit. sent back to Meade in January it's now the end of Febuary and I still don't have a replacment. Meade says ""I'll ship that out ASAP"" Read all the reviews and you start to see this same message over and over. Go look at the Better Business site for Meade Scientific, they are rated ""F"" for support. (""A"" = good). I will now avoid all Meade Products. People with working unit should consider themselves lucky..."
2,"Made in China, Made in China - Great Idea, Poor Quality",The idea and concept for this makes it a wonderful way to learn and explore the night sky. This product is Made in China and lives up to the expectations that China has set. First I noticed that the volume up press button did not click back up. The volume down worked fine...so you could say there was no sound. I put new batteries in about 4 different times trying different configurations and still it would not power up. I gave it two stars because if Meade got the quality improved I would purchase it again. I am sending this one back today.
2,greatly disappointing,"I thought I had carefully compared the MySky and the celestron product, and made the right choice. BIG MISTAKE. This product took quite a while to set up as far as getting the GPS to work. The pointing is not accurate--it identified Jupiter as a star on the first attempt, but then it worked out. The videos and audio are minimal, not very informative at all. This is WAY overpriced for what you get, and it doesnt seem well made. I plan on returning it and trying the Sky Scout. Hopefully, it works better. Meade promotes its product as having a larging database of celestial objects to find, but does it matter if it doesnt work? LM"
1,"Good idea, poorly executed, unresponsive company","I paid $400 for mine and it sort of worked for a few months. Very difficult to aim given natural shake in one's arms and poor focusing mechanism. GPS takes (when it worked) over 5 minutes to get a take. I found it not as helpful as one of the cheap sky charts. Then Meade came out with a software upgrade - and that made mine completely unworkable. Meade refused to even take it back and look at it. They told me ""sorry"" and that was it. The store (large scope company) where I bought it told me Meade has worst customer care of any one and I should look elsewhere. While I still like my 15 year old Meade scope; I find the company's attitude, and this product a waste of money and time."
1,Dead and gone,"It worked a few times, but now it's dead. The electronics don't work, so all you get for paying the hefty price of $399 is a piece of inoperative plastic--might as well point a wood stick at the sky. I'm trying to see if Meade will take the inert product back and ship one that works.I got a replacement in May, Meade came through well--no customer hassles! Put batteries in carefully, in an hour two of the battery casings split cuz of an internal short that started to fry them--never had this on any other electronic instrument. Using top-notch batteries, not some off-brand. I sensed this issue because the battery cage got to be very warm, and I opened it up and here were these two (of four) split batteries. Perhaps the battery contacts aren't very robust so they can get moved around and either (a) not make contact, perhaps my original issue, or (b) short out so as to burn out the batteries and maybe set fire to wherever you store this."
3,Overrated,"Perhaps I had too many expectations of this book, because it won a Pulitzer Prize and other awards. I enjoyed the wording and style employed by the author; the sentences and paragraphs were both very fluid and readable. My main complaint with this book is that I do not feel that I learned much by reading it, i.e., I do not believe the factual information to words ratio (facts/words) was high enough for me to recommend it to someone else. In some parts of the book, it seems that the author attempts to employ a written form of filibusters. Usually after reading a few pages or chapters of a non-fiction book, I have to sit back to take in all the information. This book never necessitated such a pause in my reading. In short, I believe this book may be interesting to those few people extremely interested in Hirohito's role during and after World War II. But, I believe most people will agree that the best one-word summary of this book would be as follows: Overrated."
1,Torture of the Highest Order,"I started this book with high hopes, but ended up not finishing it because it became too tedious. Let me preface this point by noting that I regularly read history books, so I do not expect perfect prose and/or excitement at each turn. The writing quality was what many would stereotypically expect of a historian, especially an Asian Studies historian. Specifically, the author spent a great deal of time exploring tangents and nuances, and frankly, the vast array of Japanese names required me to keep a list of dramatis personae while reading. While all of the tangents were (eventually) tied together to make a point, it made for a difficult read. I have no doubt the author did a substantial amount of research, but the finished product was difficult to absorb - it left me feeling as though I was missing something or that I had walked into a lecture halfway before the end."
1,Yet another Marixst Nut,"My wife is Chinese, to this day there still exists a great deal of hate in China for Japan and her actions during the war. I say this to clarify I am no fan of Hirohito or Imperial japan.What I had hoped to get an objective review of Hirohito and his role before and during the war. Instead what I got from this book was a foaming at the mouth rabid attack Hirohito all in the first few pages. I really had thought people such as Bix might have grown out of fanatical Marxism.This is the only time I have thought about asking for a refund from Amazon for a book. I suppose I should have read the reviews of others before buying."
4,Detailed but a little dry,"Bix's biography of Emperor Hirohito starts off a little slow. The first third of the book plods slowly through his childhood with great detail, yet rarely giving a glimpse of the ""real"" Hirohito. I do not fault Bix for the later - Hirohito was from birth isolated from the world, to both his detriment and ours. Once reaching Hirohito's ascent to the throne, the book picks up rapidly, and by the time the work reaches the WWII era, I was wishing it would go slower. While the immediate post-war period was covered in great detail, I was hoping for a bit more about information about his role in influencing Japanese culture from 1960-1989, but I found this section of the book somewhat lacking.Overall, I enjoyed reading this book, particularly the parts covering the war era (1930-1945). Bix leaves little doubt as to Hirohito's importance in Japan's unfortunate actions, and places one more dagger into the myth that Hirohito was nothing more than a figurehead."
4,"Long and Detailed, but Worth the Time","I first looked at this book to help me write a chapter in a textbook. Before long I had ordered my own copy and began the long process of digesting this tome! The chapters are long and the attention to detail can lead to frustration. However, this has corrected my understanding of Japan leading up to, during, and following World War II. I will use the information gleaned to correct every history textbook with which I come into contact that covers this period of history. This is a first-rate work and every history teacher should know something of its contents!"
4,Lèse majesté,"It's more of an academic book, with an apparently controversial thesis to defend, rather than something like David Halbarstam would write. So the firs third is pretty slow and arcane, with lots of details about Japanese politics, and history, with relevant Japanese terms tossed in. Things pick up when WWII starts. I missed an overview of Japanese culture, national psychology and interviews with people who lived through this time. But it's not that kind of a book. It's worth reading, I would recommend it for a very different perspective than you get on the History Channel, where they love to refight Midway over and over. Japanese war planners were tacticians, and overly optimistic, with their heads in the sand. None of them, nor the Emperor, served the people well."
1,Of questionable value.,"The central hypothesis offered by Bix relies on the tenuous application of modern political thought to a country mired in over 1,000 years of xenophobic isolation. There is no doubt that Showa was a deeply complex man who often was in conflict with those around him, but this indictment reads more like a piece of historical revisionist trash best left to line birdcages, cat litter pans and wrapping for fish.This absurdity does little to elucidate the Japanese emperor's culpability during the war years, and is as serious a piece of scholarly work as the nearest supermarket tabloid. Don't waste your time with this tripe."
1,An American cultural point of view,"Herbert P. Bix, an American, hasn't written a history book. It is enough just to see the little amount of details and his ""official"" comments about the atomic bombardments. There is no chapter about this matter. The author considered probably this is just a marginal subject. Mr. Bix tried to avoid the subject because he had not enough courage to write that Hirohito was to blame for atomic bombardments of the Japanese cities."
1,Barely readable,"I took the Pulitzer jury's word for this one, which was a big mistake. Another reviewer said this book was 'superbly written' and I am wondering if we read the same book. I found it barely readable. Awkward sentence structure, repetition ad nauseum, at least one contradiction (was Hirohito intelligent or not?), and no sense of flow in the material presented. It appears to have had no editor. It's the kind of stuff that one sees in academic journals where unintelligibility is a mark of genius."
5,Fun and Easy to listen,"You will love every single track of these CDs. Full of nice surprises,makes you dance wherever you are. Full of life and joy."
5,Fabulous music!,"Party, backyard bbq, boat ride, drive in the desert - this is the music to listen to. Jesse Cook is a talented and gifted musician. A great gift for just about anyone who likes great music."
4,Great Cd,I gave this CD as a Christmas prsent and my brother-in-law thought it was great. He is really into acoustic guitar music and loved the CD
4,Great Compilation,"The Ultimate Jesse Cook is not your typical ""Best of"" compilations. Most of the tracks have been carefully laid out and arranged for easy listening. His talent is remarkable. The instrumentals are awesome!"
5,Vibrant Feeling Good CD,"I bought this CD after hearing ""Mario Takes a Walk"" on Sirius radio several times. I found this cd which seems to be a compilation of some of his previous CD's. Althought I had never heard of Jesse Cook before purchasing this cd, the musical samples sounded interesting. I have really enjoyed this cd which is a radical change from what I normally listen to in music."
4,"Some 12"" goodness from Unidisc...","Another strong volume in the series, with almost all 12"" versions and excellent mastering and sound. Tracks:1. do ya wanna funk...sylvester (6:55)2. contact...edwin starr (7:12)3. fantasy...5th dimension (6:28)4. burn rubber...gap band (5:30)5. right on track...breakfast club (7:08)6. chase...giorgio moroder (8:22)7. more love...kim carnes (3:34)8. love is gonna be on your side...firefly (7:10)9. must be the music...secret weapon (7:27)10. atomic dog...george clinton (9:24)11. go deh yaka...monyaka (6:32)"
4,"Hilarious, and so true","An entertaining dissection of the workings of the soul of 3 British (very British) couples. I particularly enjoyed how the author shows the vanity of his characters who go at extraordinary lenght not to be ""found out"" -- not realizing that they didn't fool anybody in the first place. It takes depth to write about ordinary people. I found myself is those characters."
2,Neck??,"I don't know whose neck this is supposed to fit, but it's way too short and a bit too wide for most necks. The Velcro closure is barely long enough to fit a small neck so will never be suitable for most necks.The instructions are printed with errors and grammatically incorrect making them very tricky to understand, if at all.The controls are difficult to adjust having to press and/or hold this button and that for the proper ""mode"" and adjustment. Call me crazy but I just want a heating pad I can easily flip on and use. In addition, the lightweight control is placed upside-down in the very heavy cord making adjusting it a bit of a challenge; however, the cord is long enough to accommodate this ridiculous blunder should the outlet be near.I give it one star for the fact that it is versatile and one for the soft cover. You can use it for elbows, knees, etc., which I suspect, is really what it is for and not the neck."
4,Wonderful Pictures,"Puerto Rico is very beautiful and the pictures you will find in this calender are worth seeing and having in your own home, the pictures are very nice and detailed, and its huge too! Very appealing to the eye, and for those who come from the island, you will also love these pictures, i give it a four star!"
2,mystery dimensions,"As long as Amazon is unable to include the measurements of their handbags, ordering will be a fishing expedition. And like fishing you'll have to throw some back.This bag looked compact and was described as slim. I'm sending it back but thought I would measure it and post it for others who might be interested. The actual dimensions of the bag body are 16"" wide and 9"" high. Empty, it is about 1"" thick.In hand, it's bigger than I expected. That straight 16"" handle sits stiffly and unbended on my shoulder so the bag juts out in 2 directions. I feel like I'm carrying a pizza box.It also arrived with a small yellow spot on the canvas body. I thought of decorating the canvas by painting or appliqueing but the size is just too odd. Too big for a daily handbag and too small for a tote. Back it goes. But be careful as I see they have now added a ""final sale"" line to the product description."
1,Bathouse - garbage,I cannot believe a company with any customer focus would sell these pieces of garbage. The wood is flimsy and the house was broken upon arrival. It was put together with staples. I managed to salvage it and put the pieces back together. No hangers were included. Stay away from this company.
1,Not good,"I'm still surprised that it costs over $20 to build a simple bat house like this one, but after extensive searching, it seems this is a fair price.Unfortunately, this particular house is put together Very cheaply. Simple staples hold the roof on, and the interior wall / slat is not secured well, so it can shakes back & forth. But the biggest problem I have is: after mounting the house on a tree & securing with a single nail (as designed) within one week the back board has sagged & warped about two inches! The house looks like it's about to melt off the tree any minute! I'd return it, but it's been over 30 days now. :("
3,A Woodpecker's Delight,"I bought this bat house last year, and within 2 months, a huge hole was bore by a woodpecker, which has me asking the obvious question, ""Is this commonplace with cedar wood bat houses? Does a bat house have to be made of softer wood to be effective?"" The hole made by the woodpecker has nullified this project, and I have to start over with a new house. I'm tempted to try another type of house (need to research a bit) that may be more durable. One thing is certain: They say to hang it 10-15 feet off the ground. I think 15 feet should be the height. Ten feet doesn't seem like enough height. It's safe to say that you get what you pay for with this product."
4,Nice Little House,House is small enough not to be obtrusive and well constructed.It is made of cedar with the roughness of the wood on the inside so the little bat feet can grab on.There are two holes drilled in the back and this was very easy to hang.Just hang it up away from the house (unless you wants the bats invading your chimney or attic) and wait for the bats to move in!
4,cool,i have this installed (finally) now just waiting for the tenants to arrive - solid construction and easy installation - good price
2,North States Bat House,This bat house was not well built on the inside. One of the panels was not secured and I had to take it apart and re- build it. It would have been better if more attention had been paid to the quality of construction.
3,I'll go in the neutral zone,"Very light weight, hung it up in a tree. and waiting for some bats to find it... they say it can take 2 years to happen! I live in a suburban area. We'll see"
4,the life of one of the greatest poets in english language,"Gordon began her research in 1970. Her first book, Eliot's Early Years, was published in 1977 and its sequel, Eliot's New Life, in 1988. This present book is the result of further research and new information (much of which came to the author in response to her earlier publications), including new access to Eliot manuscripts; confidential letters regarding Eliot written by Emily Hale to close friends; Mary Trevelyan's unpublished memoir of her close friendship with Eliot; and a bundle of Eliot's letters which were rescued from an English pig farmer who was about to destroy them."
4,Eliot and his women,"I read Eliot's ""The Hollow Men"" at age 15, and was transfixed by the intellectual and emotional force behind the words. I still am, but I have not gotten around to reading any biograpy of his before now. I have read a couple of his other poems. This author's approach to the subject, through an autobiographical reading of many of his later works, makes me want to finally get around to reading his major works. It also makes me want to read other biogrraphies of him, in order to get fresh angles on him and his writing."
2,Disappointing,"I bought Ultimate Soul intending to escape from the blandness of radio holiday music by the likes of Celine Dion, etc. Sadly, this set does not deliver. With a few exceptions most of it sounds like unemotional pop. If you want to hear the ultimate in soul at Christmastime, buy ""Soul Christmas"". That collection will move you, in every sense of the word. If you're looking for background music that won't distract from your Christmas party then Ultimate Soul Christmas might be a good choice. If you're looking for pure listening pleasure, keep looking."
5,spectacular,"this is truly what the title says: the ultimate soul christmas collection. all of our holiday favorites are here. nat cole's ""the christmas song,"" donny hathaway's ""this christmas"" and the temptation's ""silent night"" are all front and center. there are also goodies by Lena, Ella, Smokey and Otis. An extra bonus is the warm and smokey Candi Staton track ""Christmas in My Heart"" and the Tri-City Singers' ""Carol of the Bells."" This is a must-have a great price!!!!!"
5,Can't Wait for the Holidays and then some,Looking forward to a laid back holiday season and beyond listening to this CD.
3,Very general,"This book is not that bad. As another review said, it was written in the early stages of the other White Wolf games, so theres a lot of info thats not that meaningful anymore. What it is good as it as provoking your imagination to make your own Hunter characters. After all this is a Storyteller game, so it makes sense to make your own character using broad concepts to flesh it out. Overall, its just ok but not horrible."
5,THE HUNTER'S HUNTED,IT ARRIVED ON TIME AND WAS PERFECT FOR ANYONE IN THE MASQUERADE THEME. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS SELLERAND THIS BOOK
1,"Cursory, outdated and poorly written.","Some of the flaws to a modern reader can be attributed to the era this was written in: There only was hedge magic, and the other White Wolf games weren't in their final stages. Fine. That makes the specific examples it cites fairly useless, but that's to be expected.The real problem is that this only adds slightly to the definitions given in the Vampire basic game of each of the groups of hunters, padding with typically not-so-great ""fiction."" (It must be great to have friends at a game company, and not have to be a good writer to have your fiction published.)What's good in here could be squeezed down into about eight pages. But even those concepts have been expanded in more recent supplements. Either stick with the core rules or buy ""The Inquisition,"" ""Project Twilight,"" ""The Arcanum"" and ""Ghouls"" (for the masterless ghouls who prey on the Kindred) as your interests dictate."
3,A Biased Viewpoint,"Moss gives a good overview of many alternative treatments although the book is no longer current. My main criticism is that he is obviously biased in favor of alternative medicine. A search of the internet for information on the Gerson Diet, for instance, reveals a much more negative view of this treatment's effectiveness."
5,Buy it! Buy it! Buy it! Buy it! and again... Buy it!!!!,I bought this playard when my oldest daughter was born (8 years ago). She loved it!! I was able to get in the playard with her and play and she loved that. She never cried or felt closed in because the design is so open. I took it to the beach and put it right on the sand and she was just as happy as she could be. I've also taken it to the pool. There is nowhere this playard can't go! Now that I've had my second child (3 mos.) I've started putting him in it to keep the dog off him while he's laying on the floor playing with his activity gym. This playard in my opinion is priceless and there has never been a better baby product out there to keep your baby safe from household disasters and keep you sane from chasing them all over the house! Good luck with this product-I know you'll love it!!!
2,Don't Bother,"This product is not sturdy enough. It is good up to about 14 months and then after that it wasn't as useful. Concept is great, but not functional for me."
1,Superyard XT Extension Kit....what a waste!,"After waiting an additional 3 weeks from the time I got the Superyard, I tried to fit the extension onto the Superyard as it was much needed. IT DIDN'T WORK! I guess you are supposed to get 2 of the extensions, but I still don't see how they would fit. Neither myself or my husband could figure out how to connect the extension to the superyard; nothing we tried worked. (And yes, we read the directions) As soon as I can figure out how to return this thing, it's going back! It was a waste, as was the Superyard...."
4,We call it Baby Jail :),"This Superyard is great! It gives about 2 times as much space as a normal playpen. And the extenders make it even better than that. You have to be careful when putting it together so you don't pinch your fingers...but I just make my husband do it, so my fingers are fine :) My son just loves to play in in and we hung a bunch of toys from the side to encourage him to stand and move around. Excellent purchase!"
4,Great play area,"My mother-in-law suggested we get my son a larger play pen so he can have more room to crawl and walk. I thought this item would be too large in my home, but even though it is larger than the standard playpens, it's wonderful. We just keep it over our area rug. He can easily see through it, and the best part is.. the dog can't get him. The other plus... when we go out... it can be easily moved over to our tiled floor area for the dog. There is only one down side. Your rug area needs to be well padded, if your child is just learning to stand, because if they fall and hit their head on the ground, it can hurt them."
4,just perfect,The price/benefit equation is perfect. The only negative comment is that it doesnt come with a standard USB to MiniUSB cable to charge it on any computer.
1,seller did not perform,the seller did not explain the difference between their product and other vendors including the necessary software. i emailed and seller never responded.
2,not too bright,I have found that these are not dark enough or bright enough for me. I feel that they are harder to read than the ones that came with my board.
1,A Real Dissapointment,"I have no idea how these EXPO Low Odor markers can be considered 'Fine Point' as they are thicker than a fat Sharpie marker. The colors are also EXTREMELY faint on use. I have been using EXPO Vis-a-Vis Wet Erase Fine Point markers which are actually nice, thin 'Fine Point' tip markers and the colors are very solid and dark. Lesson learned as I will continue to buy them and NEVER buy the EXPO Low Odor 'Fine' markers again."
2,CD works but case is quite damaged,"I purchased this CD for a friend. When it arrived the case was quite damaged. It was cracked in several places and about 1/3 of the spine was missing. Even though the cd works fine, it was disappointing for her. She had never ordered anything from Amazon before. She had received a gift certificate and didn't know how to use it which is why I ordered it through my account. I think it's fair to say she will think twice before ordering from Amazon after this experience. I have tried repeatedly to attach a picture of the damaged case to this review but it doesn't seem to want to load."
1,Not a good machine!,"That said, I must repeat it - DON'T EVER BUY THIS MACHINE! Krups' quality has certainly decreased over the years and this one is no exception. We have had two of their coffee pots which both exploded all over the kitchen, grounds, hot water, etc. and this one didn't fair any better. Go for a better brand than Krups - ours stopped working the third time we used it and it wound up in the trash can. We just gave up. JC Penney makes a good one! Don't waste your time or money on this one - go to a quality store and take your time and purchase a good one that will last longer than three tries This machine just died, no warning, nothing, then spewed hot milk all over the kitchen. Unfortunately, it happened during a formal party. How embarassing! I sincerely do not recommend this product!"
2,Much worse than older models,"I bought this machine because my old one had started leaking - this one leaks right out of the box and the materials it is made of are nothing as durable as the older models. Lower price, lower quality. Does not make as much coffee as the older model either. The quality of the coffee it makes, although slightly better than the Senseo by Philips, still leaves a lot to be desired."
1,Krups FND1 Flops,"This espresso/cappucino maker replaced a 30+ year old Krups 963 that finally quit. However, the brew from the 963 was superb. The FND1, after one month, has rust spots on basket holder (the part with handle). Also the tab on the basket holder, which holds the filter insert, broke. The coffee tastes horrible. I have not change brand of coffee or water: all of the coffee stuff is the same. FWIW, I cleaned the FND1 per the instructions but still the coffee is YUK!Mike"
2,Not nearly as good as its predecessor!,"Our trusty 16-year-old Krups machine was getting elderly so we bought this one to replace it, and returned it the next day. The construction is cheesy: the coffee holder has a two-flange lock rather than the previous three-flange, so water and steam leaked out around the seal. Also, the steam pipe is now positioned in such a way that even Krups' own steaming pitcher doesn't fit easily under it. Why would Krups decide to offer a new model that doesn't work nearly as well as the previous one?"
4,Not the same Krups Mini,"I have owned 2 of the older models Krups Minis..one lasted 14 years and the other I picked up in a Goodwill that gave me another 2 decent years.This Allegro does the job just fine..price is right, and performance better than comparably priced makers on the market. I am dismayed, however, that Krups is making such a cheap looking product. The plastic casing and fake metal grill are just plain tacky and worthy of a Mr Coffee machine. Handles on carafe and pod are ridiculously long and cheesy to the feel.But for the price, you get a good brew and nice crema."
3,Not as good as previous model ...,"I own a Krups Bravo 871, which I understand is a predecessor model to the Allegro. I bought an Allegro for my daughter and we were so disappointed that she returned it. For some reason, the old model makes much better coffee. It has been discontinued but there may still be a few left around."
4,Pretty good value for its cost,"We had to shop for a new coffeemaker when our Cuisinart machine broke down and it proved to be very challenging to get their customer support to respond about it. So we made it our task to find a new machine. We ran into this beauty that brews espressos, for only $50. Being a Venezuelan coffee lover, having an espresso machine sounded appealing to me, and the price was also catchy. So we went ahead and got it. It's now been almost two months since we started using it on a daily basis and it continues to perform optimally.I take off one star because it certainly feels a bit ""bland"" (the handles and most of it are made of plastic). So I wouldn't be surprised if, sooner or later, something broke with it. But at least I will not have forked over $100 for a coffee-making device at that point! :)"
1,Don't waste your money!!!!!,"After returning this item for multiple leaks, we are moving on to another product. This is the worst Krups espresso maker I have ever purchased. It didn't last more than 3 months. It still runs, but I have to clean up the morning flood after making 2 cups of ""coffee."" This item is a waste of money. It is my second one. They don't make them like they used to."
4,Can't beat it....for the price,"I've had this machine for a couple of months now and am happy with it. It doesn't take up much space, gets me some expresso / latte / capp..quickly. Cleans up easy.Note that it is a cheaper expresso / steamer - it doesn't claim to be anything else. It does what it says it will do, no more, no less."
3,"Great until the frother breaks (that is, soon after you buy it).","This is a good espresso maker. However, the frother is a flimsy plastic attachment that breaks very soon, and there is NO replacement available. So, say goodbye to caps."
1,Not so Great,"After reading all the reviews, I bought this Espresso machine. The truth is that if you want true espresso don't buy a steam machine. The shots that this machine makes are not at all coffee house quality. Very disappointed and very misleading."
1,Leaks Badly,"We had a Krups that we used for 12 years before it finally gave out--solid as a rock.This cheap, low-quality plastic machine is like nothing I've ever seen from Krups before. It immediately leaked all over the place. It's obvious the seal on the thing isn't strong enough, so that when the pressure gets high enough, it fails. At first I looked at the basket and saw coffee around the top of the rim, and thought maybe it was my fault. But after meticulously cleaning everything, and using less that half a basket of coffee, it still leaked, and I realized the coffee around the rim was because the seal had failed.I also note in the instructions that it says not to tamp the coffee down! What does this suggest? It can't handle the pressure.It goes back--don't buy this thing."
1,Krups FND111 no 871,"Just been using this FND111 as a replacement for a Krups 871 I've had for the last three years and I can't say I'm impressed.The main issue with this machine is the pressure. It's insufficient to the task. I like a fine grind and usually make 2 espressos at a time; one for me and one for the my SO.The 871 would spit out a full caraffe in about 3 minutes. The FND111 spits out about half a caraffe then seems to not be able to do the rest lending a burnt flavor to what does dribble out over the course of 5 - 8 minutes. Way, way to long.The second issue is the on switch. It's integral to brewing or foaming meaning there's no way to release the steam without also having the boiler on. No walking away from the machine for you!Given these two objections I'm hunting down another 871 to use for the next few years. Hope this is helpful and don't waste your cash. If I'd gotten one of these initially when I wanted to make espresso at home I'd still be going to the cafe."
1,"Makes good coffee, NOT espresso","This makes a lousy espresso. There is no crema and it produces an average looking cup of coffee, except less volume. I would discourage anyone craving a great shot of creamy espresso from buying this. Spend the extra bucks for a pump or fully automated one."
4,Basic but perfect,"I love this machine, it is perfect for making 1-2 lattes every morning. I found the steam wand was a little too frothy with the plastic sleeve cover on it, so I remove it to steam the milk.great buy, would recommend to any price sensitive expresso lover."
3,you get what you pay for,"I purchased this espresso maker because the older version (8+ years old) finally gave out. I knew it was not a high end machine, but was disappointed that the quality of the unit is not as good as my older model.The plastic parts are more hollow and the metal doesn't really seem very sturdy. The price was low, and it works fine. It's probably a great way to go for someone who is just starting out with making their own espresso. I, however, am saving my money for better (yes, more expensive) machine."
4,Great frother! Nice price.,"I love this machine, for the price. I have had this for 6 months and I still can't believe how well it froths! I do wish it had an automatic shut-off feature, as I have forgotten a few times. I always do my frothing half-way through the drip cycle. That way the steam is hot and ready to go. This does away with the messy water spurting all over the place some people have had.I highly recommend this if you don't want to spend much and still get a quality product!"
1,Terrbile,"This machine leaked all over my countertop. There was water flowing from every seam, top and bottom of the machine. I had about 1 oz. of coffe at the end of the cycle, the rest was water all over the counter."
4,Great little espresso machine,"I bought this last winter and it works great. The only complain I have is that it is just so small. You can make only 2 cups (mugs) of latte at a time. But I only paid $40. So for the money's worth, it is a great item."
3,Good,"I have not had mechanical problems with this machine at all. However, I would prefer the steam maker to be more flexible. It is complicated to use it, specially because it is to close to the main body. I previously had a similar item made by Oster and it was really simple to make my capuchino coffee. Now, I just use the machine to make expresso."
1,Don't bother,"I have been unhappy with this machine since I bought it from Amazon in October. I wasn't willing to pay for a pump machine and my old Krups, which I'd had for 15 (yes, really!) years made pretty decent espresso. On my old machine, I could even get crema if I used the right grind of coffee and tamped it well.This machine is nothing like my old one. A few times it's made absolutely stone cold espresso. A few times the machine spurted steam from every crevice. When it's working, it only works passably well -- no crema on my espresso and not quite enough power to ensure the milk (if I'm making a cappucino) is hot and frothy.I'm looking for an affordable pump machine now -- I've realized my mistake."
1,After 6 Months of use....it died on its own....,"I have had espresso machines before, the cheap models, and I got rid of them because I can't get into the boilng capsule to clean them, so I only got rid of them for higiene purposes, otherwise they where working well. This one dissapointed me since day one. Cheap material, and now with no warning, it stopped working... destination---> trash can.Other downside is that the steamer is too short for frothing.... I take off the rubber for easier cleaning.The other brands I had where Melitta and Mr Coffe, I am looking into a Mr coffee again."
1,DO NOT BUY,"This died just after performing the initial rinsing, as instructed in the pamphlet.Stopped working and doesn't do a thing when the knob is turned. And finding a phone number for Amazon's CS is near impossible on this site!"
2,Allegro Espresso Maker,"There are much better machines out there. I guess i got what i payed for, but i wish i would have just put in a few extra dollars and gotten something that actually makes a good latte."
2,Received item was defective,"Well this maker was received defective, as water drained out of the bottom of the unit when it was turned on. Im still waiting for a replacement from acehardwareoutlet but will probably just go out and buy something else."
3,You get what you pay for.,"For the money, this is a good appliance. I'm concern that it won't last very long...and think it's unfortunate that Krups has used some cheaper components than the older models (i.e. hollow plastic handle). I've paid more for a stainless steel pump model, and prefer this one."
3,"Decent latte, but horrible espresso.","For the price, this machine makes decent lattes. However, espressos are not worth the effort. Furthermore, making a hot coffee with this machine is almost impossible."
5,Great basic unit,"This unit replaced a Krups Espresso maker I'd had for more than 15 years, which I only replaced because the case cracked years ago and someone finally took pity on me and got me a new one. I said I wanted just a new version of my old one, and this is it. It does exactly what it should do and does it well. The new one, so far anyway, is quicker and quieter than my old one. I like the bigger handles on the carafe and the coffee holder, and I also like better the way you select coffee steam or frothing steam."
1,worked for a week,"after the first week of use, the seal started to leak preventing it from working. don't waste your time on this one."
2,Good -- For a While,"I used this machine almost daily for two years. My only complaint is the steam wand's detachable cover that promotes gunk inside the wand and is difficult to clean. That and the instruction manual that is so full of typos it looks like it was written by my preschooler. However, the machine worked well otherwise and I definitely got my money's worth out of it. I stored the machine unused for ten months. This morning I fired it up again, and a lot of what I believe were hard water deposits came out, enough to block the water flow. This despite the fact that I previously used filtered water 99% of the time. It's impossible to see inside the machine to see what the issue is. Two rounds of white vinegar and four rounds of plain filtered water later, I still have a lot of particles coming out of the machine, too many to be acceptable for drinking. I will most likely be throwing the machine away now."
4,Great little machine-saves me a bundle on mochas,"I have to concur with the previous commenter. You have to try what works for you. If you follow the instructions, you get burnt, horrid coffee. Also, because it is new, you will have to contend with that ""new"" taste for a bit while it gets seasoned. It does get better soon. Also, for frothing, I let the espresso brew first, then while that is happening, I pre-warm the milk in my mocha mug in the microwave for a minute. When the brewing is done, I transfer the milk to the frothing pitcher, and add my dark chocolate back in my mug. Then, I switch to frothing and the milk comes out perfect and much faster than doing that first. Lots of nice packed, dense foam over hot milk. A quick cleanup on the unit (release pressure with the steamer to clean the filter) and the nozzle and you are good to go."
2,One minor problem,"I have owned two similar Krups Espresso machines (Model 871). They make great espresso and are easy to use. Both died a premature death due to the same design flaw. The plastic standoffs which attach the steam boiler to the case tend to become brital and self-destruct, rendering the machine useless. Unfortunately replacement parts are not available. If replacement parts were available these machines would be a five star product. I have complained to Krups US customer service representatives about this problem and they apparently don't care enough about their company's reputation for quality to forward the complaint to the responsible quality control department."
1,Died after 1.5 months,"Received this as a Christmas present, and loved this machine until it complete quit working. One day the frother wouldn't steam, and a week later, no water came through the coffee part either. I used it once a day for 1.5 months, and descaled it once. (descaling is recommend every three months for 1x daily use) I called the customer service to get an estimate on repair, and it was going to cost more than the original price! Don't bother with this one."
1,Buy this if you want to burn your coffee (or cash),"This espresso machine burns coffee grind because it takes too long for pressurized water to flow through the grind. I am not sure if my particular machine is defective but it takes about 2-3 minutes for 50ml of water to flow through. The result - just one pure shot of burnt espresso! This is not even the case of what you get is what you paid for. I don't think anyone would pay $[...] something bucks for making burnt espresso. Don't waste your cash. Try something a little bit more expensive, and hopefully it will be better than this one. To be fair, the frother did seem to work fine.Needless to say, I am planning to return it back."
1,Didn't get hot,"I had this machine for about a week before returning it - it was easy to use, and made ok tasting lattes, but nothing got hot. The espresso was quite warm, but I couldn't get the milk warmer than lukewarm using the steam function. I'm upgrading to a better model."
1,"DISAPPOINTING - poor quality, only lasted 3 months","This is our 2nd Krups espresso machine. The first one lasted a reasonable 3 years. This replacement was much cheaper, Krups is a good brand name, what could go wrong? Well, we've used it 3 months and I'm ready to throw it away. It barely steams anymore, won't get hot enough, and leaks all over the counter.I'm searching for a different brand today."
1,Termperamental and a bit violent,"I had high hopes for this machine, as my last Krups model lasted nearly 10 years of daily use. Wow, what a downgrade. Not only the longest brew time I've ever encountered, but the process stutters - stopping up to 2 minutes before continuing - several times before it's done. The engineering is flawed, and steam leaks from everywhere. It's also prone to explosive outbursts, spewing water and sometimes grinds 2-3 feet. This machine has scared the hell out of me more than once. I'm already looking into a replacement."
2,No on/off switch?,"It works, but the lack of an on/off switch to make the water hot is annoying and makes the machine awkward to use."
5,Good Machine for the Money,This was our first Espresso machine and we've used it every day to make Cappuccino. Very easy to use (read instructions first) and maintain. Good value for the money and doesn't force you to buy the Pods. I was skeptical at first due to the low cost but after extensive use I have no reservations recommending it.
2,Cheap and not worth it,"Pros: Cheap. I cannot find anything else since when it works you get coffee, nothing outstanding about it.Cons: milk steam is too high so you have to keep the cup up while it steams milk, unless you are using a big jar with a lot of milk in it. It brings hot water instead of steam when it starts warming up, it should have an open/close valve you can use when the machine is ready to bring out some steam instead of hot water. It can get messy. You can not regulate the amount of water that goes to the coffee or the steam that goes to the milk, it seems that the valve is just an open/close valve.Bottom line: I wish I bought something else no matter if it is a few bucks expensier."
2,Disappointed in quality for a Krups,"I bought this Krups espresso machine to replace a Krups espresso machine I have had for 13 years. I was really disappointed in the quality of the machine, lots of plastic parts have replaced what was metal. Feels a little cheap. Also, where the espresso basket attaches to the machine...it is not so tight and sometimes steam/water comes pouring out.The espress it brews if fine...not fabulous, but fine for the typical user.I am tempted to go back to my old Krups."
1,Defective machine,"We have bought and used several krups espresso machines over the years, but this one is pure JUNK! It is defective, and has never worked the way it should. The machine overheats, and water and steam start pouring out from everywhere. This machine should never have been sold (don't know what kind of deal the vendor got). We don't recommend buying from this vendor."
2,Blows off a lot of steam!,"This espresso maker does not have a very tight seal between the top of the container for the coffee grounds and the socket that it is twisted into. As a result, there is an enormous amount of steam and water that comes through what should be a tight seal. This steam and water dribbles all over the bottom of the espresso maker and the kitchen counter.Aside from the mess that results, the coffee is satisfactory. Just be sure to put in lots of extra water, or you will come up short in the coffee you get to drink (because so much water is lost to the blow-by)."
2,Item NOT as pictured - you don't get the Antler,"After revieing the listing, the picture does say in small writing that the antler is not included, but it's not very noticeable. Product works as advertised, but is not pictured as advertised."
4,Not bad for a little mini vac!,"I purchase this little guy because my big vac did a horrible job on my tile floor so I wanted something quick, cordless and easy. The Shark did the job great! I did learn a few things - clean it out often (my goodness it sure picked up A LOT of dog hair!) because the suction got a little slow and I discovered that the little dish that holds the dirt filled up FAST - that's a good thing, but I do have to clean it out every time I use it. Did a great job on my tile (even picked up dog food). It doesn't do very well when used on the sides so you have to hit the dirt head on. VERY lightweight (so my 9 year old can do the vacuuming now!) Excellent swivel action. Fits very nicely under the dining room chairs, behind the toilet, etc. Quiet? Well, quieter than my vacuum cleaner. Oh, and it even coverts to a hand vac which is great on stairs! For $30, I thought this little guy was very worth it!"
2,Not well made,"When this vacuum worked, it was very nice--light, maneuverable, and swept well. Unfortunately, it worked for less than 2 days. It wouldn't turn on and it wouldn't charge. Disassembling the vacuum to put it back into the box, I inadvertently discovered that twisting the handle turned it on. Experimenting a little showed that this was consistent. This does not speak well about the manufacturing quality. Back to the store it goes."
4,Helpful for explaining prostate problems to patients,"Although this book has information which is not state of the art, the pictures and basic data are very good, and are helpful in describing medical problems to patients. I recommend it.Jennifer C. Logan, M.D."
3,Yummy,"Zapps are pretty good, but not worth the shipping costs they charge you. You'd be better off going to the store buying a bag (or a few, for the price it would cost you for the Zapps with s/h) of Jay's Kruncher chips."
1,Cheap,"Cheap. The blue on top of the shifter is already coming off and the pedals move side to side because of how they are 'secured' on. Just buy something more expensive, my set will be going in the trash."
4,Chain Saw Bar and chain,Took a little longer then I thoght to get here but not bad and it works fine. I would suggest this to others.
5,oregon bar,I haven't used this bar yet but I used one of these some time ago and it will do the job. I think oregon has the reputation of very good quality chainsaw bars and yes I would purchase this bar combo if I needed another one.
4,PLEASURE!,THIS SHORT BASIC GRAPHIC NOVEL WAS SUCH A LAUGH OUT LOUD PLEASURE TO READ. PRINCE IS AMAZING! MUCH LOVE TO SCIENCE...
5,Fantastic,"This is a series of the cutest, most real comics you'll ever read.It leaves you with a warm, fuzzy feeling, not to mention the desire for endless pages."
1,Not what you see is what you get.....,"I bought this product because after looking at every beef jerky listed on amazon, this was the only natural one that did not list wheat in the ingredient list. I bought it for my wheat intolerant daughter who needs more protein. When I got it in the mail, the ingredient list on the bag lists wheat in the soysauce. Amazon does not accept returns on food items so now I am stuck with it."
5,Looks great and easy to assemble,Excellent quality and overall a very professional piece. It was just what I wanted and fits in well with the other prices in the Cornerstone collection - Desk and Return- Staples has the desk and return on Close out but was out of the file draws. Anyhow for a low cost solution for office furniture this is a great deal
3,The product is okay; the experience was terrible.,"The product was okay, when it finally arrived. It was not delivered until three weeks after it was supposed to be delivered. Then the delivery company went out of their way to leave it in the rain rather than leave it on the front porch. Several parts were damaged. I am not sure if that was the way it was packaged or due to the manner in which it was delivered. I requested replacement parts but have yet to receive a confirmation or replacement parts. I might buy another file cabinet like this one, but definitely not from the same seller.Now that it has arrived and is assembled (with the damaged parts), the top drawer keeps getting stuck which is a pain. It looks decent, except for the damaged parts which some happen to be on the front."
3,somewhat disappointed,The finish wore off of the drain pieces in a very short amount of time. Nothing stronger than water and a soft cotton cloth was used to clean it so this never should have happened and considering the price of the item it also should have never happened. The faucett itself looks GREAT.
4,Faucets,Color was a little lighter than I had expected but decided to keep anyway. Have not installed them yet.
2,Religion Wars,"I have read a good twenty Cookson books at this point and all except one have warranted at least three stars till now. I had a hard time with this one. The subject matter did not really interest me as much as Cookson's usual choices. Besides being about a very poor, struggling family on Fifteen Streets, it focuses on the late 1800s/ early 1900s religious tensions between Catholics and Pentecostals.It has the usual dramatic twists that Cookson is famed for, but in this case they were predictable. There is the ""upstart"" struggling to better himself, good sibling versus bad, and a woman attempting to saddle a poor fellow with a bairn that isn't his.Unlike most Cookson stories, I never felt any rapport or kinship with any of the characters, However, in the end, one can read a bit of a moral in the story. Be careful what you wish for. It can often come true, but with strings attached."
5,Works great and lasts,"I've had this over 4 years now and it works well. Once in awhile, I put it in the dishwasher to keep it clean"
1,"interDesign Forma Sink Center, Brushed Stainless Steel","quite smaller than I expected...and, I had to find a slim handwasher bottle to fit in, but the suction is good."
3,Wont rust,"This item wont rust which is great but after 4 months, the screw that attaches to the suction cup broke."
4,"Works well, but not necessary","I love the fact that the rock heater does not have hot spots. I was told that reptiles can cook themselves if it gets too hot, so I also like the fact that it has a temperature control. The catch is that my bearded dragon hangs out under his heat lamp during the day and curls up in his bedding at night. We turn it on only at night or the rock surface gets too hot (with the lamp on). He only uses it when we sleep in and turn the lights on late. Then we always find him warming himself on his rock."
1,BURN YOUR ANIMALS,Hey i have had these before and my reptiles have actually been Burned on there bellies. Hot rocks are definately unsafe for reptiles there are countless reports of this happening BUYER BEWARE.
3,Good performance,"Yo-Yo Ma can play just about anything and play it well, but the selections on this CD are simply not the best. The twenty-four caprices for solo violin do sound wonderful in a lower register, especially when one considers the technical difficulties of playing a violin piece on a cello; and the caprices included here have some fascinating textures and harmonies. However, the Kreisler pieces begin to run together after a while. The recording quality is fair, but the liner notes contain hardly any information on the music. Don't buy this one unless you're really interested in Paganini or Kreisler."
5,I LOVE IT!,"I love Free to Be...You and Me probably because I am currently in the play. I actually have a preformance tonight! I love this book and its a Great Show!!! I actually never heard of it until I started the show. The great songs like ""Glad to have a friend like you"", ""Something For Everyone"", ""Brothers and sisters"", 'Free To be you and me"" and ""Free to be a family"" are all spectacular!!!!!!!! Of course every song is great !!!!!!! The stories like ""Boy meets Girl"", ""ladies First"", ""The Kingdom with no rules or Laws"" are all such good stories especially ""The Kingdom with no Rules or laws"" thats my favortie because in the show i play the mother in that story. I love this book and play b/c its about kids and I'm a kid!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,"Remembered from childhood, but seemed to be MISSING a story I loved!","There was a story I loved from this book as a child - and for whatever reason, in this particular version (which I just donated, literally, last weekend) the story was MISSING. Not as if it was torn out, as if it was not included.It was still fun to go through the rest.I bought this book, oringally, because in my 4th grade class, we sang the song FREE TO BE YOU AND ME at a school assembly. In 7th grade, I happened upon this book in a local library and was thrilled to see the lyrics to the song by the same name, and that there were funny, witty stories in the book.Even in 7th grade I enjoyed it and kept it for quite some time.Now a mother, i wanted to remember those stories and order the book for my own children... Who did not enjoy it nearly as much as I had, especially with the omission of one of my favorite stories.:-("
3,Beautiful drawnigs!!,"This book is listed in a ton of bibliographies, so I thought it was essential reading. The writing's beautiful, but most of the book was for covens, not solitaries. I'm keeping this, okay with the book, but only okay. I doubt I'll be rereading it again anytime soon."
4,Love the language,"What a classic. After reading it in High School it was fun to rediscover it again. Not the best book for a book club though, only 2 out of 6 read it. But we did love the English tea and choclate covered strawberries served."
4,great for the price,"For the price its not too bad (if you have amazon prime or you get free 25$ shipping its even better)My dog loved this toy when i first got it, but unfortunately today 2 and a half months after i bought it, she managed to break one of the knots, so i had to toss it.its a decent size, Do note that this is not mint smelling, i don't think its mint flavoured either, just mint for the colors."
3,It's a rope. For tug. What else can I say?,"Whatever taste or scent this might have, my dog didn't seem to notice (or at least not mind). She took to it right away since she LOVES rope toys. We played tug for a little bit but all she really ended up wanting to do was run away with it to destroy in the corner.I got this in large but really, it's not that big. I was hoping it would be the size of her old tug toy which was much bigger than this. I have a doberman and while she's not a huge dog, she's not small. When she grabs a toy to play tug she'll try to move up the toy a little bit to get a better grip. This toy makes the distance between that and my hand uncomfortably close. So really even for just a medium sized dog, this one is too small.I'd recommend to look for a bigger one. She loved destroying it though but it wasn't much use for tug."
3,Not really as described,"I'm disappointed with these rope toys. The description says that they are 15"" long. Well, if you stretch them out as much as possible and measure from the ends of the fringe, they are about 13"". I know it's only a difference of 2"" but it's not what I expected, and I don't like to feel deceived."
4,Long lasting,Contrary to the other review posted my gate has survived a great dane and three children . My youngest is now crawling so I need another one. My old one is fine. Sorry to the other cusstomer. I would have returned it obviously it was faulty. But Ive head great luck with mine and it is very sturdy.
1,Difficult to open and close,"While the gate is sturdy one it is up, it is hard to put up and take down. There is a ratchet mechanism that turns and then locks into place. I originally bought two of these gates when we first got a puppy and tried to use them when we had twin boys. It worked well for the puppy but so well for the twins. By the time you get it up or down your kids are already where you don't want them to be. Not the point of a gate! There are much easier gates to open and close."
1,Not a gate for the stairs,"I thought this gate was a wonderful deal for the price and the fact you could use it on the stairs. Boy, was I wrong! It works horrible on the stairs. The hinges the company sent are xxx. The gate is constantly falling off them when you open it to go up the stairs."
4,Witherington plants seeds.,"Better than his rhetorical commentary on Acts, which is saying a lot because his work on Acts is also excellent."
4,A great gated area but won't last long if you have twins!,"We bought this superyard for our twins when they first started crawling to keep them contained on the upper level of our 2-story home.The 6 panel set-up was much too small, so we had to order the 2 panel extension to give them enough room to play.This yard provided many months of safety and security for our little ones. The gate is of strong construction and our 5 and 7 yr. olds were able to climb in and out without compromising its integrity.They are now just 12 months old and weigh about 40 pounds together and we MUST unfortunately retire this yard much earlier then we planned because together the two of them are able to push the yard across a berber carpeted floor and together they are not far from being able to have one push on one end while the other crawls out from the other side.This is a very safe and well constructed gated yard and served our needs well! I just wish it had lasted for our childproofing needs a little longer!"
5,Awesome product,"This is the best thing ever! We have 2 dogs, and this is the best solution to keep them out of my son's toys and my son, for that matter, while he is so little. I can put everything inside the yard, and it all stays clean and safe. Really good investment."
4,it's a good idea but....,"When my daughter was too big for a playpen (9 months), we purchased Superyard XT to create a bigger play area for her. I was able to leave her in this yard to play with her toys alone while I was doing housework. This was a perfect idea for only few months until she figured out how to lift and move the yard around. Now I can only leave her alone for no longer than 10 minutes and I usually find the superyard several feet away from its original location. I wish this Super Yard was made of a heavier material."
1,Very DANGEROUS product,"Hi all,I just wanted to warn people about the PlayYard XT by Northstar. It is basically a big playard that measures around 35 square feet with an extention. We had the play yard in our family room next to the kitchen. Anyway, my twins, who were 18 months, were playing inside it. They leaned on one of the panels. They along with the front panel went crashing to the ground. The entire back of the play yard was then lifted off the ground and landed on top of them sandwiching them. One of my sons, landed head first onto the tile floor that is a little beyond the family room. Luckily, except for bruises on his forehead, nose, and chin, he is okay. The other landed mostly on the carpet so he was okay.The only way that I would use this product is if it were securely tied down at the base. This is not in their instructions or recommendations.This incident was reported to the Consumer Safety Comission."
4,Very Nice But Hard To Get In,"This play yard creates a rather large area to play in with the optimal shape being the 6-sided configuration although you can make it into a rectangle or many other shapes. You could even take 2 of the panels out (the set is composed of 3 x two-panel components) and make a sqaure for lighter carrying or travel. It is not recommended that you leave a side open because that reduces the sturdiness of the design.The only draw back to the system is getting in. You have to step over it since there is no gate (that I could find) for adult entry nor is it easy to unclip a panel. Although it's not terribly high, it could be a little precarious doing so while carrying a baby or other item.The construction is sturdy and is strong enough for the baby to pull up on when he begins to do that. Good quality connections. We've enjoyed using ours. ... ."
3,"Great Concept, Poor Execution!","Once your child begins to climb this system is now a child hazard. We have had this since he was 4 months old and used it so we can get done in the morning. He started climbing and now has fallen from the product and almost fell out of it. We still require a product like this but are now trying to find one that has bars so he cannot climb it. I gave it 3 stars because it got us to this stage in his life. Unfortunately now we have to discard this and repurchase something else, he can no longer use this safely. Great concept, poor execution."
3,Good at first.. now i HATE it,"We got this superyard when my daughter was about 5 months old because she was an early crawler. It worked great at first, we loved it and she played nicely in it (my house is ahrd to babyproof) but now its horrible! she just turned 10 months old and climbs out of it!! She sticks her toes in the holes in the side (WORST DESIGN EVER) and can climb on over! I have pictures to prove it! The playyard is in my living room with carpet and a area rug over it and she can push it all over, she goes to the edge and actually lifts it up and walks and pushes it. This would be a GREAT product *IF* the sides were slats or mesh or something!! This design of the holes is aweful. If anybody knows of a decent playyard let me know!"
5,Very sturdy + Nice & Large space,"We have used these gates inside and outside, they are very sturdy, however I have a hard time hooking & unhooking them together, but my husband can do it just fine. Of course that means that there should be no way that children will be able to unhook them. We have moved and I now use this gate in the play area of my home salon, and it works great. I have also taken two parts of the gate and attached them to a large doorway opening. Basically we have gotten so much use out of these, and tey still look and work great. They also resell well used. They are definitely worth it!"
4,Each child is definately different,I bought this for my first daughter when she was about 7 months. I added a mirror and some crib toys to the inside along with the toys on the floor. She played sometimes for hours. My second daughter is now 8.5 months and I bought one for her (my oldest is now nine and we sold the first one). I added the same types of toys around the inside but she did not like being in it at all. It does come in handy now - we broke it down into two parts - and it protects her from the t.v. center and the fireplace. She now plays with the toys on the gate more than ever. She just doesn't like being confined. I agree that it would be great to have a walk through area for parents.
5,New use for Superyard!!,"I absolutely love the Superyard. I have found a wonderful NEW way to use it. I work at home and have a 14-month-old little boy. I put my desk and computer equipment in his room and baby-proofed the rest of the room. I have the Superyard around my desk (corner desk) so I have formed it around in a horse-shoe like shape somewhat. I have a file cabinet secuiring one end and his dresser securing the other. He can play all the time I am working and I don't have to worry about him getting things off my desk or getting into the wires! (the only drawback is that I am in the ""cage"" now and have to constantly hop over it!! :) Makes for a much smoother work day however!!"
5,Superyard Enthusiast,"My husband & I originally purchased the SuperYardXT as a relatively inexpensive way to fence-off the 18"" tall brick hearth on our fireplace when our son started crawling. Once our son started pulling up on things, we fenced-off our entertainment center also. And now that we have a Christmas tree, we've put the SuperYard around it & the fireplace where our son can't get close enough to touch either. Although it's recommended use is as an enclosure, we've found that - if the joints are angled just right - it's quite sturdy as a fence, even when our toddler pulls up on it or tries to jiggle it. For the price, it has more than paid for itself! And if we ever get a dog, we can continue to get our money's worth by using it as a pen, inside or outside. It's a definite must-buy!"
1,Don't waste your time and money!,"Not worth the effort unless you're just looking for a very difficult playpen. It is extremely difficult to open, close, and position. It is next to worthless unless the ends are attached to one another. Using in any of the open positions is downright dangerous! My kids are nine months old today and are pushing this thing all over, including lifting it. It is too flimsey for support when they try to pull themselves up and most often end up falling when it moves (and my kids are only 19 lbs.!) Don't waste your money, I would recommend getting a portable playpen instead."
2,Ouch!!!,"I hate this play yard!!! I have an 8 month old who is crawling but not yet standing. The ""superyard"" does serve it's purpose as far as keeping her safe. It's fine if you don't mind having 18+ sq. feet of your family room taken up ALL the time. This thing is a NIGHTMARE to set up or fold. There are no instructions for folding. I followed the set up instructions and it pinched my hand so badly I now have a cut and a blister. I would not recommend this product. Portability? Not worth it!!!"
2,Not for crawling babies.,"My nine month old son was able to make the Superyard slide across the tile floor simply by crawling over and pulling up on the sides. He began to treat it like a walker...a VERY dangerous walker that allowed him to manuever his way to things that were meant to be out of bounds... carpet didn't slow him down much, although it took more effort on his part to make the play yard move."
2,Don't buy this!,"This play yard seemed to be the answer to our prayers since we have been unable to find a gate to fit across our 74"" door opening to the playroom for our 1 1/2 year old son. Then we took the play yard out of the box, and our hopes were dashed. The set-up was easy, but our son can push any side of it and bend it to his will, so keeping it in the nice roomy hexagon shape it impossible. Plus, the carpet grips are worthless and the yard is too lightweight. He can move it around the room. I cannot leave him unattended in this contraption. It was a waste of our money!"
1,Not strong enough for my little monster!,"I bought this thinking it would be a good way to section off part of my living room that I don't want my 1-year-old to get at. Unfortunately, after setting it up (yes, properly!), he could easily shake and knock it over. Giving up on that idea, I decided to use it as a play yard. It was too large for our living room set up in this fashion, but he could also push on it and it would come up off the ground about an inch on the opposite side. Although it didn't fit our needs, I tried to look at the product objectively and I'm not too impressed. I guess for smaller babies it's a really large playpen, but you better have the room!!"
2,"You can't pen me in, Mom!","Nice concept, and I'm sure it works wonders for some babies. Unfortunately, my 9 month old wouldn't have anything to do with the Superyard. He recognized it as a containment system and refused to play in it for even a few minutes. If your baby is mellow and content to play in one place, this may be your product. I suspect that more active babies like mine will not like the Superyard. As a side note, this product is rather ugly and industrial looking..."
5,Superyard XT Gate,This gate is great by itself or with an additional set for little ones just starting to crawl or even just starting to walk. This gate locks together to keep you little ones contained to a small area. The gate makes a great small play area for little ones that want to be outdoors!
2,Very weak,"It is a great concept, but it is very unsturdy. When my child pulls herself up on it, it wobbles all over the place. She is only 9 months old and only 20 lbs, and it cannot bear the weight. True that it is not bolted to the ground as some reviews have suggested, but if it is for babies, it should be strong enough to hold a baby that pulls herself up on the fence."
5,This makes life so much easier,"This is wonderful play yard. It's big enough for them to play in and still be happy, not like a small little playpen. I always took it on outings and it worked perfectly you just throw and blanket and some toys in and it works like a charm. Plus they can't hurt themselves by crawling everywhere they shouldn't be and it still gives them enough space to play. We also used it to put around our Christmas tree so our daughter didn't pull it over or get hurt with the lights and needles, it worked great. This is a must for the active baby, but once they start walking, forget it, the world became a whole new playground for our daughter and she wanted nothing to do with gates!!!"
2,Mixed Review,"This gate certainly comes in handy. It's versatile and light-weight. I like that you can remove sections to scale for different needs. I think my favorite part is the height. It's a little lower than most safety gates, making it easy to hop over.However, I always struggle when adjusting the position of the sections. My husband eventually broke one piece trying to fold it. It really resists popping into place at times. So I'm not sure I could recommend it if you plan to open and close it often. It's best when set up and left alone.Having said that, we'd be lost without it to keep our son away from the TV. I'd love to find an easier (and prettier) solution."
2,Not safe for very active babies,my son never liked to be held very much. He was walking well at 9 months..pretty much skiped crawling....climbed out of his playpen at 10 months...by 12 months he could push this play yard around and 13 months could pick it up and crawl under...we have an old house so my husband used some boards and nailed it to the floor within a month he could climb out of it...now he's 15 months and can climb in and out of it at will...he thinks it is a game...the holes in this are prefect for little toes to use for climbing and if my son didn't have more ballance he could have busted his head falling from this...if you have a quiet child this might work for a while... but don't spend the money if your child shows early signs of being very active. Maybe you can find something that has up and down bars only more like a safety gate that little feet can't use for climbing.
1,Okay for younger infants only...,"I bought this product the day my son first threw himself head-first out of his exersaucer. It seemed sturdy and large enough to keep him confined for those moments when you need to make a bed, take a shower, etc. Anyway, my little 13-month immediately started walking with it -- pushing it all over the place. He also warped the one side, thus preventing it from forming a circle. To make matters even worse, he flipped the entire thing over this morning and got out (guess who climbed the stairs and met me in the bathroom?)Not a good product for older infants. Strongly suggest for use by 6-9 month olds. For older infants, maybe a good old-fashioned playpen (if you can find one!!!)"
5,Wow! I love this gate for the dog and baby!,This superyard is fantastic! I found it brand new at a yard sale a few weeks ago. Still in the Toys R Us box. This is a fantastic superyard. I am currently using it for my dog and baby. I love that it is easy to use! I have another play yard that has several toys and is portable with alot of extra work to put it together. I put it in the basement! It is a pain to use. This unit is in one piece and folds in seconds. I can't wait to use it on vacation. I can't say how much I love this product! Like I said it can be used with your children and pets to enjoy some fresh air outside. Great sturdy play yard.
2,This is ok,"I recently purchased this gate, its okay, but its not as sturdy as it looks, its moves around and can be moved by my child. I'd think twice before I purchased this item."
4,Not exactly as described,Not exactly as described - the version received was slightly different from what arrived. the neckline and head piece were different.
1,Garbage!,"The only positive I have about this purchase is the prompt shipping. Aside from that the costume is ST8T GARBAGE! I probably could have made it myself. Material SUCKS, construction SUCKS and it did not come with the hat. They did admit to not including the cross but still I feel it was misrepresented! Good thing I have a back up! Ali G! Wag Wahn!"
1,It broke within 1 week,"Wow. This is a record low for stress-ball lifetime. I bought this thing on Sunday, and it exploded on Thursday. I used it maybe 1 hour a day. It was a waste of 5.99$.The only positive to this is that the inside material is pretty cool to play with."
1,Falls apart within months,"I've had my Gravity Gripp balls roughly 6 months now, and with only periodic use, the external rubber coating has totally and utterly broken up, deteriorated, and come off.Can only recommend for limited time use."
1,At least it won't sit in a landfill for long,"This thing's outer layers will disintegrate on you within the month. For that one month it is an alright stress reliever. The one positive aspect of this product is that at the rate it has fallen apart, it won't sit in a landfill for more than a year before degrading to dust."
2,Outer casing disintegrates over time,Outer 2 layers of this ball have disintegrated into shreds just from sitting on my desk. So I took them off and now the originally blue ball is orange! Don't know how many of the orange layers there are left to disintegrate before the innards come out. You'd think they'd use a rubber that doesn't break down over time.
5,Great stories,"My husband is enjoying the stories of the old-timers in Texas. He loves all things ""Texas"" so it's not surprising."
4,"Easy to Install, Easy to Use, Great Webcam for Beginners!","The Logitech Quickcam Pro is extremely easy to install taking minutes to get the cam up and running! The picture quality is not fantastic but just make sure it's running in medium 340x to achieve a decent frame rate in videoconferencing and you will be fine. Also be sure to adjust the contrast in low level situations and you can focus by turning the camera lens on the ""eyeball"". Software is fantastic and lets you even edit your own videos. This webcam is very good for beginners, mailing out video e-mails, live video calls and talking to friends thousands of miles away. Again the quality will depend on your computer, your connection etc but it is very good for the price ... ."
1,Logitech abandons customers,"I bought the QuickCamVC USB version, which worked fine under Windows 95/98. But then I upgraded to Windows 2000, and Logitech, who bought the product line from Connectix, has stated on their web site that they will not develop Windows 2000 drivers for the USB version of this camera, although they do support the parallel port version. It seems that I have to throw out my perfectly good cam and buy another. It will not be a Logitech!"
4,Know exactly which model you are getting,"The Logitech QuickCam Pro comes in a few differing models, but I use the USB version with the DARK focus ring. (Do not be confused with the similar looking camera with the light beige ring) and it works fine. Software version 5.3 is the best for range of set up options including using you own web site for visuals.(Some of the other versions 5.0 amd 5.4 do not seem to allow your own site set up but only to a pre-set Spotlife website) Pictures are good but camera cannot tolerate bright sunlight exposure into lens as it damages the camera over time. This model has been replaced by the 3000 model."
1,No Windows 2000 Support,"I received this Christmas two months before Windows 2000 was officially released. I was running Windows 98SE and all was well. I would be upgrading though when Windows 2000 became available.Logitech promised on their website that drivers would be provided at the end of February, at the time of the offical release date. Made sense.No drivers were ever posted.After multiple emails and months of waiting for drivers, they recently announced they would not be supporting it at all.Of course you can phone them and they will give you a ... certificate for a new camera if you already own one of these. I don't want a certificate, I eiter want drivers, or I want a new camera all together.Don't waste your money or time with this camera."
4,"Very balanced - shows everyone's ""warts""","I liked this book for the fact that the author didn't try to portray the victim as perfect, as so many true crime authors tend to do.I can't understand why a prior poster called the book ""one sided."" Just the opposite!Even Walter Scott's parents didn't come off as completely blameless. His mother, after all, did spoil her son shamelessly. No wonder he thought he could do anything he wanted to any woman he wanted whenever he wanted.JoAnn Williams helped to break up a marriage. She got a man who cheated on his first wife. Did she expect him to magically change? And why didn't she just go ahead and get a divorce from Walter? This is still America - a wife doesn't need permission from her husband to divorce him, particularly if he is committing adultery. Jim Williams should have done the same: gone the divorce route instead of murdering his wife, Sharon.All in all, Scottie Priesmeyer does a good job of story-telling."
5,Excellent Soundtrack Masterpiece,"A knight's tale is one of the best movies ever made in history. It has everything from action to comedy to romance, all which I love in a movie. The soundtrack lives up to the movie. This is one of the best soundtracks ever composed. All the songs on here are excellently performed. My favorite song would be Track #7- To run or not to run. Excellent emotional song, good love theme also. I recommend to soundtrack to all soundtrack collectors. Do not pass this one by, for this soundtrack is already hard to come bye, so if you seen the movies and loved the score get the soundtrack, i guarantee you will not be disappointed."
3,KnightsTale Scores so-so,"As I enjoyed the movie, I to some extent enjoyed the score. I preferred the soundtrack much better, but thought this cd was of equal quality, just not in my personal opinion. I believe that the score was well set up to follow the plots in the motion picture. I would recommend this for anyone who enjoys easy listening that is also exciting and partially up-beat."
1,The Daddy Guide is a dud,"Although bits and pieces from this guide are helpful, the book generally falls flat as far as advice goes for new dads and moreover seems to cater to an upscale crowd with a huge disposable income and the idea that all men enjoy things such as big cars and watching sports on TV (not all of us do). From encouraging cigar smoking for new dads (yuck!) to relieving your child's colic fit by dumping them off with a babysitter for a few hours (sorry, but I would stay with our baby and comfort him rather than drive off to a restaurant with my wife and worry about whether or not the babysitter is calming him down yet), this text is a not-helpful guide for new dads. The only saving grace of my copy is that it was given to me by a previous new father--now I know why."
5,Smooth the skin,I love this product... the crystals slough off the dead skin to reveal a beautiful healthy glow. I always get compliments after use.
2,A crying shame.,"I love the Byrds, but this cd is an embarassment. The lineup is great, especially ""She Don't Care About Time"", but the sound is atrocious, even for Columbia Records, who were notably careless with their early cd releases. The songs are in mono, which is fine for a singles collection, but the sound is reminiscent of a worn-out cassette. Also... the liner notes ramble on about how much better the single version of ""Why"" is, but the version here is the album one, from Younger Than Yesterday. Sony really needs to clean this mess up, or get it off the market."
4,"Sound could be better, but the album rocks","I relistened after reading the comments about the mastering of this, and I have to admit the complaints are reasonable. I had gotten past it by just cranking the bass a little in the equalizer, and accepted that the voices were a little, just a little, muddy, but not enough to keep me from enjoying the album tremendously. Someone suggested having CBS reissue using the original mono and just leave it at that. I probably would buy the album on CD again if they would do that. So much good music here. Buy it if you don't have it on CD yet."
3,Original mono masters,It doesn't sound as good as the 1997 Cd's becasue it used the orignal mono single masters. If you want to hear those mixes then get it.
5,simply beautiful,"This album is incredible. The Sixties, in my opinion, is the greatest decade of rock music. Everything after needs to pay it's respects to these ten years and the artists that played during them. The Byrds' songs are beautiful. The Dylan covers aren't just covers, but re-arrangements and an attempt to fit the song to their image. It works. ""Eight Miles High"" is a classic. Even now the band's harmonizing vocals on that song sound fresh and exhilirating, making one feel that all the groups today garnering praise are all pretenders to the throne. This collection features great songs that would otherwise not be included on a greatest hits compilation or similar release. Well worth the money."
3,Love this brand....,"but unfortunately they were just too long for me, even in heels. I have a pair of these that I have worn for years, but they are wearing out because they are my favorite jeans. I was skeptical ordering clothes since I couldn't try them on. As it was I had to send them back. (at least returns are pain-free with Amazon) I suppose I could have paid to get them altered, but after spending $155 on them, I really didn't want to invest more. Maybe I'll be lucky to find a pair at a second-hand clothing store for a lot less. Great brand, though. I will forever be hoping I can find another pair that fits me!"
3,"Sectional pole rather ""wobbly""...","For the price this is a fairly good bird feeder with a pleasing appearance. However, I had problems with the hollow metal six-section pole pieces. I found it difficult to insert the pole ends together and when finally connected it proved to be a rather ""wobbly"" pole that would come apart if lifted and would curve when burdened with a full load of bird seed. If you don't plan on using the pole to support the feeder then this is a good deal. Otherwise, plan on obtaining a more sturdier one-piece pole to help support it."
2,you get what you pay for,"No way to keep pole upright... first bird or wind that hits it and the thing is standing lopsided in your yard. Albeit inexpensive, it's a waste of money."
2,a waste of money,"This looked like a great idea, I bought 2 other feeders with this one last year. The Pop-up Coach feeder is already in the trash can. I bought it for the pole which lasted one week, it got bent by the wind. I also had problems with the ""pop-up"" falling down. I don't recommend it even to hang up. not worth the hassle or money."
3,a clinical day at the piano,"Perahia is a great pianist, he is fantastic at Bach, solid in Beethvoven - but here he fails to convey the lyrical value of Schubert in my view. I find his playing rather too clinical and lacking in emotional expression. Sorry to all Perahia's admirers (including me). I cannot recommend this."
5,Total Inspiration,"I first heard Daniel Nahmod at the Religious Science Asilomar conference in 1999. He is not only a musician, he is a teacher and minister. His music is inspiring, healing and full of the love we are all made of. I make his music part of my regular spiritual practice -- this album, his Serenity album, and his new single, One Power, which is an absolutely awesome ministry all by itself! Thank you, Daniel!"
2,Hard to read,"This book has many odd semi-repeating phrases. They are difficult to read silently, let alone out loud to your toddler. My husband and I are regular, everyday readers and we love to read to our daughter. However, this particular book was very difficult to find a rhythm or safe pace to read with. The illustrations are sweet."
5,"A warm, soothing read","This is a great read-aloud story. The text has a nice cadence to it, in the mold of Margaret Wise Brown (Goodnight Moon Big BookandBig Red Barn Big Book), and it holds up well to repeated readings. It is a nice little tale about Sam overcoming his fear of walking up to the neighbors' houses all by himself to deliver holiday cakes. The snowy scene and the warm ending eating cakes in front of the fire bring a peaceful setting just right for bedtime. And the illustrations work great."
2,Awkward to read aloud,"As some of the others who reviewed this book said, this is a very sweet story with great illustrations, but an extremely awkward-to-read-aloud text. I find myself making up new wording for every page each time I read it to my daughter because the flow of the text and dialogue is so strange."
5,Must see for all Catholics.,"This is a must see video for all Catholics. Although I saw this long after I left the Catholic church, I wish I saw this earlier."
1,Slick editing and ou-of-context quotes,This video is a great example of propoganda. They take snippets of quotes from various interviewees and weave them together to march their own agenda. Go to catholic.com and you'll see how badly the producers of this video trampled on the responses of the interviewees.
1,MORE ANTI CATHOLIC TRASH!,"Do not be fooled by the editorial reviews of this trashy video about ""devout"" Catholics. This is nothing more than Fundamentalist propaganda against the Catholic Church. Don't these so called ""Christian"" Fundamentalists who keep denying that Catholics are the FIRST AND REAL CHRISTIANS, have anything better to do than to malign the Church? Our Lord Jesus Christ established the Holy Catholic Church as the ONLY institution to teach in his name and of all the Christian religions it is the ONLY one that can trace its origin back to Him. Anyone who bashes the church is bashing Our Lord Jesus Christ.When St. Paul was persecuting the Church our Lord asked Him why he was persecuting HIM. He did NOT say ""Why are you persecuting my church"". Get the picture?"
3,Good tool for teaching the full Christian Truth!!,"I used this video to teach a class on Catholic Apologetics. The class would watch one of the segments and then we would address the material presented (sometimes over a few class sessions). After that idea was throughly explored, we would move on to the next section of the video. In using the video, I divided the material into 3 categories - (1) Correct presentation of the Catholic faith, (2) Misunderstandings of the Catholic faith, (3) Misrepresentations of the Catholic faith. In each case we used only the Bible to refute the errors the video presented. Though it was a little gut wrenching to watch, it was a very valuable tool in firming up the Catholic faith of the class and giving them an insight into the thoughts of the opponents of Jesus' Church and how to defend the truth!!"
1,Will make you laugh and cry...for the wrong reasons.,"A very laughable presentation of what the producers think the Catholic Church teaches, though as you can see from other Catholic posters on here that these claims are far from the truth. In fact, one can simply open up the Catechism and see that the Catholic Church doesn't teach what this film says it does (i.e.- regarding the 2nd Commandment, Marian doctrine, etc.).That alone should keep people from wasting their money on this anti-Catholic propaganda, unless of course you are looking for a chuckle. Unfortunately, I doubt Our Lord in Heaven would be smiling with you."
1,Anti- Catholicism made to look Catholic,"There is nothing to be gained by such an anti- Catholic video.In using small sound bytes and overly edited interviews this video seeks to show the ""truths"" of the Catholic Faith.The truth of the film is that James McCarthy, is a disgruntled former Catholic, who today he is a Fundamentalist minister who describes the Catholic Church and its teachings as ""an insult to the finished work of Christ.""If you want to know the truth about Catholic teaching-- this is not the film for you."
5,Love romeryopf products,Bought this because I read about toasting garlic in the microwave using one. Wanted to try it. Works great and looks nice sitting atop the appliance.
2,Too basic and general,"I was very disappointed after reading this book. All the information contained in this book was something that anyone could gather if they had the ability to think a little, and I think if the book was targeted to law students/lawyers, it's safe to assume that they all can.The first part of the book mainly defined what a lawyer is and provided general guidance about how to find a job, which doesn't differ from any other job book. The second part of the book listed alternate careers, and they are just that: a list of careers with a short description. I found the little personal stories included in the book very unrealistic and atypical, hence offer no inspiration. I did not relate to any one of them, personally.In sum, if you can think of where you've worked at and what type of work experience you have had, try to find a position in that field/industry, and use your law degree to your advantage. That's pretty much the usefulness of the book."
4,The bird feeder of my childhood...,"This feeder brings back memories of watching the birds as a child during my summers in Maine. When the seeds get low, you could often watch the birds on both sides of the feeder, until one bird got a little too proprietary, or the other got spooked and took wing.It holds enough seed so you are not filling it every day, but not too much, since as I remember as a child it is easy and fun to watch the seed poor in from the swivel top.I do heartily recommend putting it on a shepard's crook or placing a baffel over it, since it is user friendly not only for the birds, but for the squirrels, too."
2,Decent product - poor shipping,"The product is what I expected and happy with it.That being said, I purchased it thinking I would get it within 5 business days - I did not. They say 2-3 days processing, and I ordered it with 2nd day shipping. The product wasn't shipped until 7 business (weekdays) days after I ordered it so it wwas actually 9 days until I received it. very disappointed since it was a gift for someone. Just important to note that."
1,FRAUD-- this product is poly not nylon,"This product is misnamed and misadvertised, DO NOT BUY THIS.You are being overcharged for nylon, when it says right on the spool it's ""POLY"", as in polyester. Polyester is significantly cheaper than nylon.I am LIVID with Amazon, especially given a customer has already complained about this, see the other 1-star rating.This is my 2nd failed Amazon order in 2 tries, the store is becoming filled with cheap mal-advertised junk. my last order was a drink shaker that broke on the first day during normal use.Amazon better shape up and start inducing some quality control with their products, this is infuriating for a mail-order company where returning items you can't see with your own eyes is a MAJOR disavantage to brick and mortar stores.So now I'm off to Home Depot, Lowe's, Wal-mart or Target where I can actually get what I paid for, at 6pm on a Friday night. And how much you wanna bet Amazon doesn't let this post go up as written?"
5,Surprisingly accessible entry on an important topic,"I was given a copy of this book because a friend contributd to the work. I previously had no background or interest in the topic, but decided to look through it out of curiosity.As one without a science background some parts of the book were technical and mysterious to me. But I was surprised to find much of it was quite accessible, and drew my interest. This is an important topic for anyone that cares about the economy and ecology. Prof. Westendorf should be commended for compiling an impressive work."
5,"Highly recommended, especially for church youth libraries and Christian households with younger children.","A Child's Bible is an anthology of stories from the Old and New Testaments of the Christian Bible, adapted for young adult readers to enjoy and interspersed with simple yet colorful illustrations on almost every page. Most sections of the bible are rendered into short passages several paragraphs long. Quotes from Jesus Christ and other Biblical figures are typically repeated verbatim; other story elements are often streamlined or simplified. ""St. Luke 8-1-3 Jesus Journeys: Jesus visited every town and village teaching and telling people the good news about God's kingdom. He traveled with his twelve disciples, and certain women whom he had healed, such as Mary Magdalene, Joanna (the wife of Herod's agent, Chuza), Susanna and several others who had money to help support him."" Highly recommended, especially for church youth libraries and Christian households with younger children."
3,Very Elementary,"I bought this bible for myself because I was told that if you are beginning to study the bible this is a good one for adults too. Well it's not a complete bible - missing alot of scriptures - I'd say its a good ""story book"" for a child but no way is it a ""complete"" bible."
2,Not for a beginner or medium player,"Very small print; difficult arrangement, almost same as the original score. Perhaps good for a professional, but a pro would know how to read the score (especially that arrangements are in the same key, i.e. mostly 5 flats or 4 sharps). Love fake books, but not this one :("
1,Judgement!!!,The only thing I have to say from just looking at the preview is: BLASPHEMY! BLASPHEMY! BLASPHEMY! And you will be judged harshly by God for using and misleading the children with this ABOMINATION of a project! REPENT NOW! Pastor Roberts in DC! I also put 1 star because the review page gives no option for no stars which it really rates...
5,Love birds,"I just can't leave this book alone! I read it long ago, saw it once in a used book sale at the library and didn't buy it. Then I came across it again this week at a thrift store. I grabbed it this time. I rarely knowingly re-read a book, this is an exception. Like one of the other reviewers said I am ready to start reading it again as soon as I finish. It was so perfect, I guess we would all alike to think that's the way true love can work out.This one is a keeper for sure."
5,One of my all time favorite books!,I have re-read this book every year. I consider it among the most well written novels in my library...on the par of a Nora Roberts book (and that's saying alot). The characters have great dialogue. I agree with the other reviewer who said she didn't want the book to end.
1,This is supposed to be romantic!?!,"I was shocked by the story of HUMMINGBIRD. The guy pulls a gun on her and makes her kiss him. But because she likes it it's romantic. Had she any self-resptect she would have thrown him out, wounded or not! I enjoyed the era of the book, Spencer is fault-less when it comes to her description of clothes, scenery and people. But the whole gun thing--come on!"
1,Snoring,"Could they have rehashed the same dialog any more times? I love historical fiction, but every time I tried to read this story I fell asleep after three pages. The at gun point kiss, give me a break!!! All this take me by force, sexy bad boy stuff is garbage!"
1,Abuse as Foreplay? No Thanks!,"I enjoyed Spencer's ""Years"" and I looked forward to reading this one. However, I really found the themes distasteful. Being verbally abused and being forced to kiss someone at gun point is not foreplay. I couldn't continue after that scene. If a man ever treated me this way, I would run far, far away, and never look back. The myth that bad boys are bad only because of past bad experiences but become good because of the love of a good woman tells women to tolerate rude, offensive, and even abusive behavior. Skip this book if you have any self respect!"
3,Some Slow Segments,"I have read many of Ms. Spencer's books and this book was so-so. I was intrigued with the first few chapters, however there was constant bickering between the two main characters... Sometimes amusing and yet other times, I just wanted it to stop. I saw a great character arc for Abbie, but I didn't feel that Jessie really changed in any way throughout the book. He affected her character arc, but she did nothing to bring him to a different level. The whole gun thing really didn't work for me. Some readers would find this book in really poor taste, yet I agree that others would enjoy it."
3,Abbie was a little annoying,"This is the first Lavyrle Spencer novel I've read and I think she is an excellent writer. Her characters were well developed with lots of conflict to keep you going but I think I've had enough of sharped-tongue,feisty, repressed women who yell and scream at the hero to hide her own confusion. Granted, Ms Spencer probably wrote this novel way before any of the other ""strong and plucky"" heroines I've read lately, still I think I'm more into the sweet love stories without all the ranting and raving."
5,Best Romance Novel Ever Written,"I have never come across another book I've enjoyed more. The only novels that come close would be Ms. Spencer's other writings. She's incredible. After you read this, run out and get everything she's ever written. I re-read them constantly. I've yet to find an author who can compare. If anyone has any suggestions, please let me know! I doubt it!"
1,"Certainly not an ""encyclopedia "" of all Roseville Pottery.","I purchased both the first and the second of the Roseville series by Sharon and Bob Huxford, hoping that I would get a complete guide of all Roseville pottery with prices. Unfortunately the ""encyclopedia"" was not complete. I guess this is how the authors sell books by not putting together a definitive book on Roseville."
5,A Real Go-to Book,I liked this book's no-frills approach to the classroom. It didn't require much preparation or special items. I think it would be useful for any teacher.
3,Fianlly a decent repaint job that makes since,Ok first off:Aquaman should get a 5 stars. I bought this set just to get an Aquaman.The rest are alright for repaints. At least these fit in with the series and make since on why they would do repaints.
2,Sugar in Beef Jerky,"Short and Sweet: this beef jerky is quite sweet, compared to commercial jerky. In a one ounce portion, there are seven (7) grams of carbohydrates. For those on a low-carb diet, that is a significant amount.I notice that in the more ""natural"" jerkies, they tend to use more sugar. Perhaps it helps the texture and make the jerky a little less likely to dry out.It does show this on the label, which Amazon makes available, so don't make the same mistake I did and buy impulsively.If you are trying to find a beef jerky without preservatives, and from animals raised without antibiotics, etc, then this product is acceptable, if a little sweet. But if you are on a high protein diet, avoiding carbohydrates, then beware."
5,ten times better than cow meat,"For taste, health , original american tradition, low fat, high protein, melt in your mouth flavor, juiceiness, tenderness, conservationism, love for what the North American continent originally had plenty of, happiness that from almost losing one of the best meats in the world it is now available again, and hoping that Buffalo meat eventually replaces a substantial portion of the present beef and pork consumption, this meat product earns the highest recommendation."
5,Great Collection of Cult Movies!,"Hello,This has several great movies, like Dementia 13, Frozen Alive, The Screaming Skull, Jesse James Meets Frankenstein's Daughter."
2,Smith Chart Book,My husband wanted this book for some time. I found it at Amazon at a good price - better then two other places I checked.
5,Works well,My son is a HUGE Bionicle fan - he loved the brush and it worked well. I will be looking for it again this year.
2,poor quality,"Product is understandably inexpensive. It is coarse, rough, and not to absorbent. I'd rather spend double and get better quality."
2,Item received is NOT the item pictured.,"The product displayed is Dynarex non-sterile gauze. Product received is generic (not dynarex) non-sterile gauze. To be fair, although the picture is a lie, the item description is accurate."
5,A perfectly wrought tale of terror!,"Like the American GI's who descend timorously into an ancient temple at the beginning of Christopher Treagus' ""Hunting Sorrow,"" I ventured, skeptically, into a genre I hadn't touched since reading a collection of Clive Barker's short stories almost five years ago. I was pleasently rewarded with a first-rate novel by a first time author that I will recommend to all my friends."
3,"Somewhat dissapointng, though captivating","It's a fun book, and really makes you think about your own relationships and why men are threatened by successful women. However, I liked Stella better and was expecting the same fast-paced stream of consciousness in the narrative. The ending was also somewhat dissapointing to me. Still, I couldn't put it down. A good novel to take to the beach."
5,the best book i've ever read,"this was the first book i read by terry mcmillan. i hadnever heard of the lady. this book is so true to lifehow can anyone not love it. all women can relate to themain character. and men will identify with franklin--especially those of color. just the best book ever. inmy humble opinion, even better than ""waiting"". a must read!"
3,read the book before you watch the HBO movie!!,"this book was good. i didn't like her character too much b/c she stuck with a guy who had absolutely nothing going for hisself (no education or money), who had kids he couldn't take care of and who beat her while she was pregnant (with HIS child). she should've been strong enough not to get involved with his tired ass. or dumped him when he came out and told her the truth. but besides the character, the book was consistent and a good read. however, the movie is TERRIBLE. it didn't show the valuable points the book had. it was horrible! please read the book before you watch the movie."
5,Disappearing Acts is an excelent book.,"I love the book, it was so real and Iam sure that a lot of people agree with me. I will support Mrs. McMillan, on any book she may write. I was hoping that Disappesring Acts be put on film I already had the actors in mind,that should play the parts. Jada Pinkett Micahel T and a couple of other good actors.Thanks for reading my review."
5,Another MUST RE-READ!,"It was probably 1995 or so when I read this book. This is the second book that I completely enjoyed by this author. Disappearing Acts was kind of depressing, but so real! I thought maybe it was based on real life. The writing was supurb as usual for Terri McMillan. I think it is time for me to pick this one up and read it again. Can't wait for the movie! THANKS FOR THE MEMORIES!"
3,Well written but disappointing!,"McMilliam did an excellent job describing the characters Zora and Franklin. You really felt what each character was going through. I was a little disappointed with Zora and the choices she made as far as Franklin was concerned. Before she met Franklin she was a strong, black woman who after meeting the sex-crazed, handsome, ""can't hold a job"" man, became his sole provider on more than one occassion."
1,This book makes me mad!,As a self-respecting woman I say don't take that from anyone. McMillan seems to find romance where most people would find disillusionment. The main character is pathetic. I just wanted her to kick the man to the curb and get on with her life. Then the book might have been redeemed.
2,review of Terry McMillan's Waiting to Exhale,I thought the ending of this book was so disappointing that it really affected the entire story which was a really good read until then. I am disappointed and surprised that the author chose to keep together a man who had actually raped his girlfriend. It also surprises me that so many people are so in love with this book. People do change but there was no realistic explanation of how Franklin was now worthy of trusting.
3,A LOVE STORY???? I THINK NOT.,"To me this novel is not a love story, but relationships like this one do exist. Franklin a lazy high school drop out who thinks that the world owes him something, and Zora a good woman who truly stands by her man. Sound familiar anybody?!?!? Honestly the story itself was very good, I could have done without all of the bad language, and the ending was DRY!!!"
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED,"I am a big fan of Terry McMillan, but I left this book disappointed, and perhaps even annoyed and insulted. I love the strength and self-reliance that Terry allows her female characters. However, I found the main character, Zora, to be unassured, too pleasing, too forgiving, and overall weak. This character was very disappointing coming from Mrs. McMillan. Not to mention that I ended up LOATHING Franklin, who was never truely justified in any of his awful actions towards Zora, his 'love'.I left this book very annoyed and disgusted with the end result. I'm hoping for more strength in the future!"
2,disappearing acts,Enjoyed this novel to a certain extent. Disappearing Acts was good but wasn't as great as A Day Late and a Dollar Short.
4,Searching and finding,"Terry Mcmillan wrote an excellent book chronicling the love and life of two extraordinary people. In searching and finding love, it's easy to accept and reject those that do and do not fit our ""ideal"". However the union of two people as different as Zora and Franklin shows that the union of hearts and minds knows no reason, they just follow their hearts. Yes, Zora is the quintessential woman but Franklin is a diamond in the rough. Yeah, the brother is intelligent yet uneducated, he is artisitic yet lethargic and yes, he's got his share of flaws. However, he is so human, a product of his environment and surroundings, his negative attributes stems from a less than idylic family but he has heart, a great heart that wants to love and be loved. That is what connects Zora and Franklin."
5,Excellent Book!,This book caught my attention from beginning to end literally. I read it in 4 days which I think sets a new record for me. it was an excellent book and i would suggest it for anyone to read.
3,It started out good...,"I was excited and involved with the characters during their introduction chapters. It was well written but a little too much detail for the let down (there were about 100 pages of extra reading time that could have been saved). I expected more than I got. Perhaps that's a flaw on my part. There were too many low points throughout this book and the ending was even worse because through all the drama, Zora still hadn't changed and Franklin got worse."
4,EXCELLENT STORYTELLING; DEPRESSIVE STORY,"No one can take away the storytelling ability that Terry McMillan brings forth. However, her female characters are always usually so weak, depressing and sex-a-holics. I've read all of her books (with the exception of Stella--...You can tell that Terry writes about herself and her family, that's why her writing is written with such passion because she's actually lived her words...""Disappearing Acts"" is about her relationship with her son's (Solomon) father...Terry Mc gets a 5 star on her ability to tell a story, but a 4 on the story and characters itself."
3,"Good, but not the best of Gorey","THE IRON TONIC, originally published in limited edition by Albondocani Press in 1969, comes here in a more widely accessible reprint. It is one of his brief stories where each page shows a droll pen-and-ink drawing with the briefest of text. Here, the tale (well, there's very little plot) is set in at a grey hotel and snowy environs in Lonely Valley, home to various aged and ""unwell"" people. Along with each illustration is a couplet, e.g. ""It's known the skating pond conceals / A family of enormous eels."" Most of the book is made up of the wanderings of a handful of characters and what they see in this strange wintry landscape, where objects fall from the air and a dead orphan lies beside the path.Somehow I didn't find this as satisfying as some other Gorey efforts. If you've never read any of Gorey's work, you can't go wrong in starting off with THE OTHER STATUE. Save this one until you are a bit more acquainted with his art."
1,"Woefully, out of date","The service was great and the book was in excellent condition. However, it was so out dated I threw it in the trash. Glad I didn't pay top price for it."
1,AWFUL MOVIE,"This is just plain bad. Wish i hadnt bought this dvd. The storyline is dum, the acting alright. Wouldnt waste money on this movie."
1,These guys are friends?,The guys in this movie are miserable. And it makes me miserable watching them.
1,None of these Tests Are Given,None of the tests in this book are given anymore. There is no reason to buy it.
2,Waste of time and money,Some tips are hepful but the practice exams are a real let down because there's no explanation of the answers. Most helpful to me in the math section. Too expensive for what little you get out of it. It really doesn't address middle grade professional knowledge. Better skipped to find a more useful study/resource guide.
3,Factual recounting of a proud story.,"This book captures many of the day-to-day decisions and events that lead to the creation of the 1st Cavalry as an Airmobile Division. During my 4 1/2 years in the Division I served, among other duties, as a unit historian and had the opportunity to meet many of the men in the book. The author does an excellent job of putting color to the black and white of printed pages in other books. If you or a loved one of yours served in the First Team, you will want to read and own this book. I have two copies in my home -- one for each of my children when they grow up."
3,Who Really Knows?,"Taken at face value this is quite possibly the definitive volume on the evolution Army Airmobile doctrine, tactics and operational employment throughout the Vietnam conflict. It is well written, concise, and a pleasure to read. The problem lies in the substantiated charges against the author for misrepresenting his military service. This fundamental lack of integrity calls into question the research and conclusions of all works by Mr. Stanton. If you trust his research it's a great book, if not it might as well be fiction."
4,Good deal,Fast fast service and good product. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a similar product in this price range.
4,Works on 1999 Bonneville,It fits my 1999 Bonneville. I can't comment on its durability yet because I've only had it for 2 months and haven't used it religiously.
4,Very Good Bucket Seat Cover,This is a durable cover and easy to install. The only reason I don't give it five stars is because it slips around a bit and I don't have any way to keep it from doing so.
4,Great for protecting my front seat from spills,I ride around in my car with two toddlers and I was constantly placing drink boxes and food containers on my front seat. I finally ruined the leather and had to have it repaired so I purchased this seat cover to protect the restored leather from my abuse. So far it has done a great job. It is really uncomfortable for a person to sit on - very lumpy and uneven. So I have to pull it off if I have a front seat passenger. I would also recommend not washing the cushion that is inserted under the cover - the seams ripped apart and had to be sewn back together after one washing. But the cover itself is holding up very well and despite some big spills it has really protected my front seat.
2,waterproof????,"I ordered these particuler seatcovers because they claimed that they were waterproof. I had just purchased a new subaru outback. I frequently take my 4 small dogs with me; one of which is still only 9 months old & still a rambuncious teenager! He can get into things & I wanted to be prepared for any spills, etc. To make a long story short, he tipped over my almost finished latte onto me & the drivers seat. I immediately pulled over & cleaned up the mess(about 1/4 cup total)! It blotted right up, but when I checked under the seatcover, it had leaked through in that short amount of time. The covers appear to be made of a strong material & they were easy to install, BUT they are not waterproof!!!"
4,Solvit Bucket Seat Cover,"I bought a 2011 Sierra Pick up off ebay at a dealer about 1 12 hour from my home. Dumb menever realized that the interior is a light grey. But I loved the truck so went ahead andbought it. The pick up is my farm and dog truck so light seats are not good. I went to Amazonand found these seat covers and felt they were a great price. Well when I got the seat coverit was only one, who only buys 1 seat cover? Plus it's not soft to sit on, rather slippery. Butit does fit way better then the picture shows and is better quality then I thought it would be.So I went and ordered the second seat cover for the second bucket seat. For my work/dog truckthey are great but feel they need to sell in pairs but then I probley would have bought a differentseat cover because the price would be high. So I'll read the product info better from now on..."
5,Great purchase,This seat cover is wonderful. It is exactly as described and very easy to put on and take off. I also like the mellow color so that it doesn't look so obvious that I've got a seat cover on there when I'm transporting a dog. Highly recommended!
4,Great seat saver!,"This seat cover is great over all. I have a dog with short hair, that is extremely difficult to get out of the seat upholstery, and this definitely cuts down on that. The only issues I have with the cover are that I wish the straps that wrap around the seat had some sort of snaps instead of just an elastic band that must be worked up and down the seat to make it faster to put on and off the seat, and that surface is a little slippery for my dog. If she is not sitting just right, she starts to slide off the seat when I turn corners."
4,serves the purpose,"purchased for new sante fe with air bags in the seat. cannot get fitted covers, therefore this is solution for my dog in the car. easy to put on."
5,a must have with golden retrievers,"These covers are easy on, easy off, yet stay in place. My very wet dog has yet to soak through them and they have definitely collected the sand and hair which vacuums up easily. I highly recommend this product."
3,artistic murder,"Not a great murder mystery as such, but a very interesting novel that challenges our perceptions of what constitutes art.Somoza raises really provocative questions as to what we would do for art, is art good because of the way it is marketed and is it better for having a hefty price tag?The other questions he leaves us with is when is nudity art and when is it pornography? Does this change with how old the model is or how much they want to do it? When does art become abuse and is it excusable because it is art?I found the concept of the novel intriguing, being a futuristic Europe but with current structures of business and employment exploring the ideal of art. That the book was marketed as a murder/mystery/crime novel was unfortunate as that part of the novel really didn't quite work and got bogged down in the detail of art galleries and art works.I recommend the book for anyone interested in art or who likes to be extended with new ideas."
1,"Please, Do Not Waste Your Money!","I do not write many reviews but you must be warned that this book is simply bad! The CD's tutorials and video are too amateurish to provide serious learning. I was becoming so frustrated with the lack of depth, lack of organization and lack of clear explanation. Instead, buy Final Cut Express 2 Editing Workshop by Tom Wolsky OR Final Cut Express 2 Digital Video Editing for Everyone by Weynard."
5,Just what I was looking for...,"after having a few of the bowls from this set broken, I went looking for a few replacements. This fit the bill just great. The price was right, and it was a company I knew I could trust."
3,Great Idea for show,"This is fairly enjoyable. While the script is clever and the premise is suspenseful, I feel that the actors didn't quite meet the expectations and it eventually led to the downfall of the show. I would deffinitely watch the series because it is very entertaining, but you sorta walk away thinking this could have been great but it is missing something. This first season was ABC's top performer when it first aired. Season 2 disappointed with its rating and season 3 didn't have enough ratings for a renew. I own all three seasons, but I rarely watch them because I normally would prefer to watch something else."
5,Best Fantasy Drama,"Kyle XY is one of the best drama series of this generation. It is filled with suspense, family drama, science fiction, and comedy. It continues to make you think and ponder why we make the choices that we do, while showing the best in all of us is possible. Well worth watching."
3,unexpected good,"i was a bit surprised by this show and couldn't actually find anything bad about it. It has great potential.If u r a fan of mistery and scif-i shows im sure u will like it, i did."
5,Kyle XY,A TV series that more accurately presents the pressures teens have growing up today. Some do make bad decisions. Those decisions do not have to control their life. The Sci-Fi story lines just keeps the interest of those not always based in reality or see the world differently. Good blend of veterans and newcomers in the cast.
4,Good Innocent Fun,"I enjoyed this series of DVDs, and would be happy to share it with my teenage nieces and nephews (without having to supervise). ""Good Clean Fun"" is what springs to mind. The lead actor is convincing, and one wonders what series two will bring. I for one will be interested to see."
5,A pleasant surprise,"Just who is Kyle XY? That's what we'd all like to know. I bought this dvd set having only seen 1 episode of the show. I had no real idea what was in store but I was pleased with the result. Kyle XY is a refreshing ABC Family show that will have you rooting for this strange young man with no memory. The first episode will have you in stitches along with having you reach for a tissue. It's a great family show with good values and even a lesson learned. It's fun to watch Kyle grow up in such a short amount to time and even more amusing to watch him learn new things. I'm desperately hooked and you will be too. Rent it or buy it, but definitely love it."
5,A must for your Collection's,"This show is a wonderfull show, I have been whatching it since the beging this is a dvd box set that I recamend to all of the Kyle XY Fans too get.for the show it self is great and the drama is as well wonderfull, the director did a great job in creating this show, this show is not only as an aspet of great charitor well written, and has been done with class, for anyone to whom likes Donsons Creek this show is just as great if not even better. the Chariters in the show are very well done, and you get to know them like they are as part as your family. The only other show that I would even say that would be as well done as this show would be the TV show called Party of 5. Well guys don't just take my word on this great TV Show, see for your selves."
4,Love this show,I love watching this show and cannot wait for the 2nd season to come to DVD and the 3rd season to start.
3,just passably entertaining,"This show is mildly entertaining, mainly because of the charming Matt Dallas as Kyle XY. The other cast members, with the exception of X-File alumnus Nicholas Lea, are mediocre or poor in ability; the scripts are goofy and very predictable; absolutely every cliche is present in regard to teens and their behavior, their sibling rivalry, their silly non-conflicts and issues, and so on. And almost every scene opens with a stock shot of the foster family's house. So it's passably good, but not that great.If you want a really good ABC family show, try Wildfire instead."
1,Lukewarm and bad coffee,"I got this coffeemaker because it was recommended by Consumer Reports. Since I got it, I am really disappointed. The coffee comes out lukewarm, even if I preheat the carafe. The carafe and the travel mugs are not dishwasher safe, so if you dishwash the carafe it gives a horrible taste to the coffee, trapping liquid between the inside/outside wall, liquid that cannot be cleaned. Also, it uses filter no. 2, but the filter holder is not big enough for it. The consequence is that you cannot make strong coffee unless you just make a single mug, because you cannot fit enough coffee inside the filter without having coffee powder leaking into the carafe. Finally, it also takes an eternity to brew two mugs. I strongly recommend against it.Update to the review: our coffee maker broke after approximately 5 months of use. We didn't bother to use our warranty."
3,Their other albums were better.,"If you're expecting their usual ""Macarena"" style tracks, you'll be disappointed. In spite of this, I like some of the tracks. (Nina Piensa En Ti & El Amor) The remakes of Papi Chulo & Cheeky Song are a letdown. But if you like upbeat latin dance tracks, then buy this album."
3,Good but a little vague,"If you are someone who has never considered the idea of sexual energy being more than we realise it is, then this book is a good introduction just to that concept. If you are have already taken that on board, and want more practical instruction, it is a bit of a disappointment. I think Haich is quite an 'old school' writer, and tends to stop short of giving out the real information. I think there are probably much more open books out there these days. But if you are an Haich fan, the philosophy in this book is great."
1,A piece of junk- belongs in the dump,"I would have rated this CD -5 stars if possible. This is NOT music, its a bunch of crap. People talking in childish voices about playing with dead body parts and being retarted and stuff, its all random and just junk. This is not music, nor would I say art, i would like to call it, yes, junk, crap, retarded, all those words come to mind. I found on the entire CD only about 2 complete songs that had an intro, melody w/ a chord progression, a solo, coda, and so on so. THe rest were either a stupid chord progression for 30 seconds or just a random blur of a bunch of notes. DON""T BUY THIS!!!! YOU WILL BE WASTING EVERY CENT!!!! I wouldn't have bought this if it was only a dollar, i wouldn't take it if it was free! It is garbage. Dont buy this, and if you have it, I beg you to throw it into your trash can so it can go where it belongs, at the dump!"
1,This was not music,A year ago I did not even know Buckethead existed. I heard Electric Tears playing in a new age store during the summer and loved every song. After reading some reviews I bought Population Override and Kolma. They both were incredible. Decided to give this Bucketheadland II a chance and was totally disappointed. I could not get rid of it fast enough. It was a painful experience to listen to it all just in case there was something good towards the end. There wasn't!
4,"Don't buy the album, but buy a few songs","First let me say that the riffs and music here is worth a purchase from any metalhead. The grooves and chunky heavy hooks are awesome. The problem is half the Cd is just meandering dialogue and crap. lol Sure, some people obviously like this concept albumn, but I'd rather just stick with the music.So what I did was take all the ""real"" songs, and burn a CD mix with Enter the Chicken and a few other Buckethead Classics like Nottingham Lace...and when you play THAT Cd, it's a classic.So...I'm giving this 4 stars for the actual songs, and taking away a star because of the non-music filler stuff that kills the experience for me."
2,Fair,"Obviously Buckethead is a great guitar player. On the metel sections of this album, you can hear his adapt chord blocks, and he has the magic fingers to play fast leads.But running in place on the upper neck does not make a great soloist, and that is what Buckethead does for most of his solos. There is no real archatecture at work, and there is nothing that seperates him from freeze dried 80s metel wackers. Yes, Verenon Ried employs some of the same techniques, but as part of a bigger, blues based whole.The concept of the album seems to be serial murder, and when Bucket is not scampering in the upper register, he rambles like a demented baby about playing with bodies all night. All this has a midly adolesent appeal, but it sure does not make a great free jazz album.This is flashy at first, then it just gets boring."
3,I live in wyoming 7/24/99,"I live in wyoming, and have read Ghost on the Range. This book has many true storys, but there are some true storys that have been left out from the Lovell and Byran areas. I speak as one who has personaly been withness to the ghostly happenings that have occured."
1,No-Research Book?,"How can an author write ""true"" ghost stories and not bother to do any reasearch on the geography? Some true story.....seems to me most folks would want to make their ""true"" stories accurate. I would've given it a 0 star, but 1 is as low as you go."
3,"If you like ghost stories, the book is very entertaining.","Although entertaining, Munn made several errors of geography. If you are unconcerned about Wyoming geography, you will enjoy the ghosts."
4,Looks really nice but had to buy another piece to attach it,"Looks really nice but had to buy another part from an auto part store to actually get it to attach to the SUV hitch. I wished that there had been a better explanation of the package contents, individual pictures would have been especially helpful. This was a gift for someone and I certainly did not want them to have to supplement my gift by buying an additional part just to be able to use it. Cannot speak to durability, but the quality does look nice so we are mostly pleased."
2,sirius one svi rating,The product was delivered as said. Don't buy this device. Pay more and get one that doesn't cut out. I had an early Starmate device and it was 10 times better.
1,JUNK!,This unit was terrible! Extremely poor quality reception and quit working only after a few days. WOULD NOT RECOMEND THIS UNIT!
2,Problematic,"I have gone through four of these units. Several were defective out of the box. Sirius has the best customer service and replaced defective units without a problem. Buy at your own risk. However, you know it is backed up if there are problems."
1,Battery in Remote,THIS IS A GOOD PRODUCT EXCEPT FOR THE BATTERY INSTALL FOR THE REMOTE CONTROLI HAVE TRIED ALL WAYS AND STILL CAN NOT GET IT TO WORK. DO NOT KNOW IF I JUST CAN NOT GET IT IN OR JUST A PROBLEM. I USED TO SELL ELECTRONICS AND THOUGHT THAT I WAS GOOD AT IT BUT I AM HAVING TO MUCH TROUBLE WITH THIS ONE.
4,Not bad for the price,"Nice and small (about the size of a pack of cigarettes) and comes with everything you need to install yourself. Sound quality via the FM transmitter is decent, though far from being outstanding. The unit does get quite warm which I've heard is normal. Reception (in Los Angeles)has been excellent. Price is right as well, a welcome compromise from having to shell out well over a hundred bucks for an in-dash unit. The best part: being able to once again listen to Howard in the morning."
4,PRESETS!!!!!,"PRESETS!!! - Hope that got your attention if your presets don't work and your radio defaults back to 184 every time you turn it on. I took the advice of one of the reviewers, Alexander Adamov. Although my radio was already activated and picked up all channels, it too defaulted to 184 and the presets didn't hold. I went on line to my account as Alexander suggested and reactivated my radio. It was not until a couple of hours later that it began updating. My screen was reading ""5%, 10%, etc."", and,by the way, this did not happen during my original activation. After that it has been fine...the radio comes back on to the station I had previously listened to, and the presets work now. Thank you Alexander for your input. Hope this helps with some of you who have been having the same problem. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because, as other reveiwers have mentioned, you can't read the screen when the sun is shining."
4,Neat Sirius Radio,I ordered the Sirius One from Amazon after looking at competing (mostly XM satellite service) radios. The Sirius One is a lot more solidly built than the other units I see on sale for $75 or less. It has solid-feeling controls and was easy to set up.Other reviewers have commented that the sound quality is imperfect (definitely not as good as cd - or even a strong FM signal.) I would agree - my suspicion is that this may be a limitation of the Sirius satellite radio service more than this particular unit. For this reason I've given 4 stars.
1,Dead in 1 year,It was fine for the first year. But once the warranty ended - so did the life of this unit.Buyer beware.
2,Defective,"After using my brand new unit for about 2 hours, the FM modulator stopped working. If I plugged headphones into the unit it was fine, but it would not transmit to a radio. I tried two in-home radios and one car radio and it did not work. I also own the Sirius Starmate and that works great. I ended up returning the unit. I give this product two stars because when it did work it was a great little unit."
1,Do not buy this!,"This is my second Sirius receiver. It does everything I want EXCEPT that the display is unreadable, no matter where you place it in your car. At night it is fair, but still not clear! Unbeliebable! I am so disgusted I could cancel both my subscriptions if one of them was not a lifetime sub."
5,DAVE SEAMAN LADIES AND GENTLEMAN!!!!,"funny name jokes aside this guy is a legendary artist in my book!! i loved just bout all tracks here!!! highlights to me are 1)Seann Quinn & Andy Page - SQAP (SIKKKKKK) 2)Nufrequency - Buy Me 3)Chab - Sunrise (these two rockers can appreciate)....to be honest i think the two cds are as close to a perfect set to me as it gets!!! if your a fan of this music genre this gem is an absolute MUST-HAVE!! TRUST ME, you will not be disappointed!!!!"
1,"Not that interesting, and terribly racist.","The story started interestingly enough, but then become more and more convuluted and illogical. A detective novel, but not well done at all. Worse, it is horribly racist with the worst negative stereotypes and language. I do not recommend reading this book. Not worth the effort."
2,A Failed Attempt,"Although this book's marketing material states that it is designed to counter the Hollywood version, the book instead ironically tries to justify the standard Hollywood claim that Bishop Cauchon was a sincere fellow operating under lawful procedures - in contradiction to the many historians, as this book itself admits, who have soundly and consistently debunked that idea. This book does not present any credible evidence to back up its claims, selectively quoting (or misquoting) testimony at the appeal while ignoring both the majority of the witness testimony at the latter trial and glossing over or excusing the well-documented illegalities of the original trial.There have been many other books which give a more substantive and accurate accounting of the Condemnation trial, including previous translations such as those by Scott and Barrett."
5,Smaller version of brush I love - great to carry in purse or car!,"Had larger version of this brush it seems forever & loved it! Concerned it might be nearing replacement time & having no recollection of its origins, I did a Google search which brought me to Amazon. It's identical! It has just enough give in the handle so as not to tug & pull on the hair wet or dry AND does not produce the static that ordinary brushes do. I bought multiples of the large and small versions. Gave them to daughters & granddaughters and kept extra for myself. Never knew it came in the smaller size which I love for carrying in the car or when I'm out clothes shopping and the static from pulling clothes over your head creates a look of fright! Love it!"
2,Did not last that long,"This grinder was OK in producing an even grind. Unfortunately it often jammed and ocassionally stopped working, even though I would not run it for more than a minute. (Maybe it overheated?) Half the time it would not start at all. Finally it refused to work at all when you pushed the button.The last time my husband tried to make coffee he pushed the button hard to get it to go and the button fell into the grinder. I think a 4 year-old grinder that wasn't used more than twice a month shouldn't have fallen apart like this."
3,Put your hand on the top,"So far this is a good but not great product due to what seems to be a common flaw in this model (my ex had one and it did the same thing). It ran perfect the first time I used it. After that, I noticed that it would shut off or not run at all. The fix seems like it was pretty easy though. After you put your beans in and the lid back on, lightly push down on the lid while it is grinding. If it wasn't for this flaw I would rate the product higher."
1,Not ready for prime time,"Not even slightly consistant. No matter how you set it the amount it grinds changes like the weather.Not to mention that the coarseness is virtually the same on any setting.That is, monday it's coarse, tuesday it's fine, wednesday it's like powder. Unless it's raining, snowing or sunny. Then all bets are off. I expected much more from the Krups name.Besides the power button breaking after about a year (just hit the switch with a pen or knife or whatever to make it work if yours is broken) the settings buttons are horrible.Once you grind 3000 pots you get an idea of where you want them set. But... seems no matter what you do there's a different amount of coffee ground each time you use it. No matter where you set it.And it's very easy to bump the settings if you move it and you'll never notice it. Thumbs down for me."
1,Not worth it at any price,"This is my second try at a burr grinder and I guess I'm going to have to pony up and buy a really expensive one now. This grinder is noisy, constantly jams, doesn't really produce different grinds of coffee (and if it doesn't do that what's the point?) and is unbelievably messy. Set at the coarsest grind still gives a really fine grind of coffee. I haven't figured out a way to get the receptacle out without spilling coffee all over the counter; all in all a bad investment."
2,"Nice size, quiet, but...","I received this grinder as a present (per my request)and will be taking it back to the store. The size is fine, and it is very quiet - but the beans continually get stuck. I've tried the unit 5 or 6 times now, with limited success. This early-morning coffee drinker needs a grinder thats a little more reliable!"
1,Not very good for my purposes,"I received the grinder as a gift from my wife. It's primary use is to grind beans to use in my espresso maker. It doesn't grind the beans fine enough even on the finest setting. I have tried cleaning, taking it apart and putting it back together to no avail. I ultimately resort to grinding the beans twice or more which the instructions tell you NOT to do. But what else can I do, it doesn't make a fine enough grind. For now, I grind the beans where I buy them which sort of defeats the purpose of owning your own grinder. I'm going back to the drawing board to find a higher quality grinder."
2,It only looks cool!,"I have had this coffee grinder for going on 4 years now. This grinder has a trendy look to it, and doesn't take up a lot of countertop space. However, I spent $85 on this machine and it has not been worth the trouble. I haven't had a lot of trouble with the grinder it self, I like the different grinding settings and about every 6 months I have to take it apart and clean the grinding components. The mess it makes every time I remove the the grounded coffee is irritating, I end up with coffee grinds everywhere when removing the collection compartment. Frankly, I have tolerated it for all these years simply because I paid such a large amount, but I hate the mess it makes. Would I purchase it for the $30 it is now being sold for? NO, it simply makes to much of a mess."
5,Why did I wait so long?,"This little gem is not to be reckoned with by its competition. Quiet, fast, efficient, and with enough grind settings to satisfy the most demanding preferences, this appliance should be a staple on any coffee lovers counter top. Easy to load, easy to use, easy to clean, this is a must-have to prepare your morning cup of Joe."
4,5 months of experience,"I saw some very negative reviews for this grinder which caused me to comment - as my experience has been good. The product has 2 issues: 1) it will mysteriously not grind if the plastic container is not inserted fully. The light does not go on, and that's the clue. Once you figure this out and push the thing in fully, it works reliably. 2) it is not whisper-quiet. It's quieter than my prior Bodum, and I'm not standing around the kitchen listening to it, so that's not a big issue for me. Other than those issues, the product is a good value, holds a lot of beans and keeps them fresh for a few days (by which time, I've consumed them), and I get no spillage nor mess. I use Cafe Filtre and am able to get the exact coarseness I need. There may be better products out there, but I'm satisfied."
1,Don't go cheap-it's awful,"My son and I were about to put this in our cart a few weeks back, when upon further scrutiny we decided against it because the the bean hopper was much smaller than the model we were replacing, and we just had a general feeling we would not be happy with it. Well the next week my husband and I passed it again in Costco, and decided to give it a try. It is going back today and here's why.1) we could not get a course grind from it--It states 17 grind settings but, the course grind looked closer to an espresso grind, nowhere near what we are use to for french press and drip.2) we could not keep it grinding without holding the lid down.3) the lid over the hopper is stuck and we can't open it fearing that it will snap and break. Don't let the Costco and Amazon low price entice you . . . you'll be sorry.If the lid wouldn't have stuck, I would have rated it two stars."
1,Poor Quality,"We've had this grinder for a couple of weeks and are very disappointed given the Krups brand.1) Nowhere in the instructions does it state that the hopper lid must be held down to begin and during the grinding process.2) For no apparent reason, grinding stops before the desired amount of coffee is ground. This requires starting another grinding cycle.Trouble is, one can't be sure if the proper amount has been ground since bean measurement isn't necessary. Lots of guessing.3) Grinder apparently jams as the burr has a whirring sound, but no coffee is distributed. I can only assume that there is a bean jammedsomewhere within as other reviewers have stated. However, I'm not going to the trouble of disassembling as this grinder is going back.Glad the 20% or so of happy reviewers have had a positive experience but given the statistics, they got lucky. I wouldn't risk it."
2,You get what you pay for with this machine.... maybe....,"I've been using mine for a few weeks. The unit is a bit tempermental in that the top has to be on ""just right"" or the grinder won't come on. Probably a safety feature gone vigilant. No matter how many cups (measurement) I set to grind it always grinds the same amount, so I have several tablespoons of coffee left over leaving me with three options - drink way more coffee than I want, throw away the extra, or make the next batch with ""old"" grind....hmmm. But the thing that makes me the most crazy about this little creature is the mess it leaves on the counter every time I pull the receptacle out after grinding. Haven't figured out how to keep all the dust from landing on my white counters - I guess I could unplug it and carry it over to the sink. Too much work for me first thing in the morming... I've owned a cuisinart grinder and this one has a much more uniform grind and is a bit quieter. But I'm thinking to return it and try another brand."
1,NOT a fan,"My old burr grinder finally died...it seems my caffeine habit is harmful to appliances. Bought this, I mean, how different can one burr grinder be from another? I'm used to some grinds escaping and a little clean up. I didn't realize the shear amount of grinds that get all over the place with this machine. They are everywhere. But that's not even the worst of it. I can only grind when my husband is home, because I can't get the dang cover off the hopper. In order for the machine to work, the cover has to be pushed down all the way....and once that happens, you can't get it off again, at least, not without a fight.Please, if you have any other options, DO NOT buy this grinder! For the love of coffee and sanity! To subject us to such frustration BEFORE we can even down that life enriching cup of black joy is simply cruel!"
1,Going in the Trash,"Ok, it does grind beans - and it does that part well. But in the process, it generates so much static electricity that the grinds are everywhere - all over the grinder, the counter, and you.It might work well in a humid climate - I don't know - but it sure makes a mess in a dry climate."
1,Disappointing,"I have had innexpensive grinders that have lasted a long time. This grinder was purchased in January thru Amazon - A2Z Home Center.I had to leave a message and have not been called back. The grinder just stopped cold and will not start again. I am the sole user, I take good care of it, so it has not had heavy use. Very disappointing."
3,Second try...,"We sent the first one back because we thought it was defective - it won't do a very good coarse grind (for french press), and it will grind way too much coffee; if you set it to 10 cups drip you get twice as much coffee as anyone would put into a coffeemaker. Then we read the reviews and found that these are common problems with this product. The replacement grinder was exactly the same, with the added glitch of beans getting stuck in the burr and we have to stand there and shake it so it doesn't overheat. We looked everywhere for another one, but there doesn't seem to be anything else out there. In summary, this product's features are great, but its performance is poor. Are this a design or a workmanship issues? No one knows..."
3,"Nice unit, produces too many grounds","Like the reviewer above, I too found that this unit produces way too many grounds per cup. I am at least happy to see that it isn't just my unit.If you buy this, I advise that you experiment with the right quantity settings. For us, to produce grounds for 8 cups, we'd set it at 4 to 4+.REVIEW UPDATE - I called Krups to ask about producing too many grounds for the setting. I was told that the setting is just an ""approximation"" and that the finer the grounds, the worse it approximates the number cups you've set.We've stopped using the grinder because it is unreliable."
1,Poor build quality,"I got this grinder because it seemed ridiculous to pay three or four times the price for the nice industrial-strength Kitchen Aid grinder that I saw sitting next to it on the shelf. After a few months of using it, I know why it's cheaper -- it continually fails, even on fresh, oily Peet's beans. As another reviewer noted, when it jams, you have to unload the whole thing into a bowl, disassemble it, note disconcertingly that the insides are made of plastic, and put it all back together.And in actual use, this grinder leaves the largest countertop coffee-ground piles of any grinder I've used.It's extremely frustrating and I wish I'd bought the Kitchen Aid to start with. Poor build quality, short lifespan, and poor design."
1,skip this one,"Used it four times before it permanently quit on me; each time grinding about half a pound of coffee. Unlike other reviewers who claim that the grind was too coarse, my Burr was too fine in the high setting, and just like talcum powder in the fine setting. Save your money and look elsewhere."
2,"Decent grind, annoying safety features","Received as a wedding gift and honestly liked it at first. Gave a good consistent grind for daily coffee and occasional espresso. Then the annoyance and frustration began...The hopper is way too small and requires you to fill it every couple of days. In doing so you must make sure the cover engages with two sensors that make sure it is closed. Overfill the hopper and you're hosed. Get some wayward grinds or dust into the sensors, no coffee for you!The outflow container suffers from the same problem - two little sensors to tell the machine no coffee will fly everywhere. I don't know how many times I cleaned it out just to get a day's coffee only to need to clean it out a few days later. Don't even try to clean the grinding elements, unless you want more frustration.We have since switched to the Cuisinart DBM-8 - loud as a jet, but over 18 months of problem-free grinding (and cheaper too)."
2,good grind but doesn't last too long,"this is tne second burr coffee grinder I bought, neither one lasted too long. Maybe I need a more expensive one. I'll just go back to my regular coffee grinder. I've got a Krups because I have a regular coffee grinder from Krups that's lasted me for years. I do like the flavor from the burr coffee grinders."
1,"Yeah, mine broke too.","Got this as a gift and it worked well for about two dozen uses over the course of two years (we're sporadic about our coffee drinking...). Then, as many others have noted, the power button ceased working. It just would not turn on. There were no jams, no grounds build-up and everything was secured in the correct closed position - just no go.Krups responded with a form email about packaging and sending it insured at my expense to one of their service centers with proof of purchase. Since it was a gift, and a year out of warranty, I'm out of luck. I'd have to spend $50 shipping it both ways anyway.Rather than spending the bucks for a quality burr grinder, I'll probably go back to a cheapie. Skip the Krups."
2,"OK but not great, and then it failed","I owned this for about 1 year before it ultimately failed. I would rate it, when working, as 3 star--it did produce a grind of coffee that you could tailor to your needs. Fine was very fine, near powdery, coarse was definitely coarse. But it was not a real even grind. For example on the coarser grinds you'd still get some powdery stuff (makes a notable difference when you're using a press pot). Cleaning was a pain. You had to do it pretty frequently and it was a messy bother. It is distinctly cheaper than some of the competition, though, and I would have been content if not totally happy with it except that it broke. Just gave up the ghost one day. Stopped grinding. That send me out to buy a comparably priced Capresso, which I'll not review here except to say that it did not hold up, either. That brought me to the higher priced Capresso (the ""Infinity"" Conical Burr Grinder), which has been an absolutely FABULOUS grinder."
1,"Don't Buy, It Breaks","For a cheap grinder, it grounds alright, but the safety features are extremely small and they can break off easily. Once they break, you may as well throw the grinder in the trash."
1,Junk,"Bought this and brought it home looking forward to trying a burr grinder and shelving my blade grinder. Assembled it per directions, loaded the hopper with beans, set the grind at medium, set for 12 cups, turned on, motor spun, got about 1 tsp very fine powder. Emptied bean hopper, disassembled, cleared jam, carefully reassembled, reloaded hopper, set for coarse grind and 12 cups, turned on and it ground every bean in the hopper into extra fine unusable powder, made a real mess all over everywhere. Cleaned up, disassembled and carefully reassembled again, loaded hopper, another whole hoppers worth of beans ground into ultra fine dust, static cling and another big mess. Disassemble, clean up, rebox, and return. Ordered the Breville for 40 dollars more from Amazon and couldn't be more pleased. My recommendation is don't waste your time with this Krups."
4,Reliable and not too noisy,"I've used this coffee grinder for about a year with no problem. It grinds enough for 12 cups quickly without totally ruining one's hearing first thing in the morning. My only gripe is that the removable container isn't that well designed, and getting coffee from the grinder to my canister often seems to result in grounds all over my kitchen counter. Of course, being half asleep in the morning may account for that. . . .!"
1,"It ground about one teaspoon's worth, then quit feeding the beans","Given that Krups does a good job on coffee makers, we expected this burr grinder to be good. Unfortunately, it was terrible. It ground a small amount of beans, then just quit feeding them down into the grinder. It would keep spinning until the timer ran its course, but would not grind any more beans. I spoke at some length with a Krups customer service representative, and all he could conclude was that the grinder must be defective. We returned it and bought another, this time from a local store. The second grinder had exactly the same problem. So we gave up on it and will not try a third Krups grinder. We've had a Braun burr grinder for years. It's noisy as the dickens and a bit of a nuisance to empty, but at least it does the job. Unfortunately, Braun no longer seems to have a burr grinder on the market. So we'll upgrade to a better model, as soon as we can find one under $200 that does not seem to have serious reported drawbacks."
1,A piece of JUNK,"This grinder is a piece of JUNK. My unit broke one month and one day after I bought it. The beans often get stuck in the hopper and won't fall into the grinder area - then the machine just runs at full speed. The only good thing I can say about this unit is that it is relatively quiet - but that doesn't grind coffee beans. Overall, a piece of JUNK that I am returning to the store for a refund."
2,Very messy,"The reason for the low review rating is because of the mess this grinder creates. Yeah, it may be quieter than others, yeah it may have a plenty of space to hold the beans,but what a mess. The plastic container inside the machine leaves coffee powder on the counter when it's removed from the machine. The lid of that container spreads coffee dust all over when it's removed from the plastic container and then you have to pour the container into the coffee machine or your coffee ground canister. This is a poor design. The best grinders have a simple container that does not leave ground coffee dust all over the counter. Keep shopping.............. JIM"
2,What a mess.,"Basically, if you want to get grounds everywhere every time you use this, this is the grinder for you. Especially good for people who have some sort of self-loathing type of OCD in which you like to make messes just to clean them up right afterwards to get that special feeling of completing something."
2,quality control may be an issue,I drink coffee daily and like it a little stronger than some. I grind about a pound a week. Used the large Cuisinart for about 2 years then it stopped working. Tried this Krup and was relatively pleased for the use of my drip maker. I liked that it was quieter than the Cuisinart. Didn't like that it was smaller capacity. Found that it ground coffee much finer than settings would appear to call for. This resulted in overflow of grinds from filter. Quite messy!I was in process of experimenting with grind settings but the unit no longer grinds after only about 2 months of use. I have gone through trouble shooting without results and unfortunately misplaced my receipt so I may be out of luck.If it didn't stop working I would probably rate it a 3.5.Buyer beware.
2,Powder - the ONLY setting!,I have had this grinder for about 3 months. The grind has been stuck on the finest setting (no matter what the dial says) from the beginning. Now the timer has quit working and it grinds (into powder) as many beans as are in the hopper. I do NOT recommend this grinder at any price - unless all you want to drink is espresso!
2,Ain't what it used to be.,"After owning a Krups Burr grinder for many years, we passed ours on to our son and ordered a new one. The switch didn't seem right at first. It was hard to start. Amazon sent a replacement and the new one was the same. It's new stlye switch that Krups is using. We sent the replacement back unused. On either the second or third bag of coffee the motor burned up while grinding. Now we had to send it off to a service center. They called and said that we would get a new one from Krups. After more than two weeks we are still waiting. We always ground 2 pounds at a time with the old grinder but I guess with the new components this machine is just not up to it. I would bet that they are putting Chinese motors in them now. What used to be a great product appears to have gone down the toilet. Amazon has been great. Krups - we'll see!"
4,Great little grinder,"I am not super picky about my coffee, but I prefer not to drink swill either. I use locally roasted custom blend coffee and I like it to be consistent. I started using this grinder in place of a cheap $15 blade grinder. This unit works very well for my application. roughly 4 cups/day. It only took a couple of tries to get the grind like I need it for my single cup brewer. Cleaning is really no big deal, takes only a couple of minutes. The only thing I would change would be the volume, it is a bit loud when I am up at 4:30am making coffee and trying not to wake the kids. However, for the price, I don't really have much to complain about in that area I guess. This unit does as advertises - it grinds coffee consistently and the auto-shut off part is cool too so I don't have to hold the button in the whole time it is grinding. For <$40, I recommend it for sure."
2,Wish I had read all the reviews,"I purchased this grinder about four years ago, and it finally died this week. It would have a hard time on the fine grind settings, so by default I had to set it almost fully coarse in order for it to work. Other reviewers noted that it makes a mess when you remove the ground coffee container - true; and that it tends to get stuck at time - also true. It is also a pain to clean. Save your money on this unit and either get one of the blade grinders, or bite the bullet and get your beans ground at the store. I gave it two stars because it did last almost four years."
1,Bitter Coffee,"I bought this grinder because of all the hype I read about burr grinders. First, it's very inconvenient to use compared to just measuring the coffee into a blade grinder and transferring it to the coffee maker. Second, it makes bitter coffee. According to Krups' instructions, coffee that's ground too fine for, e.g., a drip machine will be bitter...well, no matter how coarse I set the grinder, some of the coffee beans come out as a fine powder...and yes, the coffee is bitter. I'm back to using my Cuisinart and Braun blade grinders...and back to much better coffee."
2,this grinder sucks.,"Okay, this is the first time i've written a review, but I had to because I'm usually very easy to please. NOT this time! This grinder (for $[...]) is awful. First of all, the SECOND time i used it, the grinder was running, yet the beans wouldn't go down into the grinder and it just whizzed away (which by the way, will throw off your cups measured if it thinks it's grinding and it's not). I had to knock on it just to get the beans to grind. THEN, the even on the coarsest setting, the ground coffee was WAY too fine. Just like baby powder. It made horrible coffee that was very bitter. And don't say it's my coffee maker. It's not. Very dissapointed."
1,Save the receipt-- you will return this messy grinder,"1) Transferring the coffee to your coffeemaker is a MESSY process, the plastic ground coffee holder is tricky to remove, the coffee sticks to it due to static; the holder's lid falls off, so you get coffee all over your counter. I have to clean up the area after each use.2) the fineness selector is perpetually stuck on FINE or VERY FINE. It always seems to make a fine powder that gets everywhere around the coffee-making area.3) the No. of cups selector always gives a lot more coffee than you need, so you'll end up measuring anyway,I previously used a $15 grinder which only had an on/off button, gave me big chunks mixed with fine grind, didn't measure the coffee for me, but it WAS NOT messy at all. Overall, I prefer my old coffee grinder."
3,"Good for drip, NOT good for presses","I bought this grinder just before Christmas 2006 to replace our blade grinder. We use coffee presses and the blade grinder didn't grind evenly and there was always silt in our coffee. This grinder did not fulfill our expectations. We use the coarsest grind and it is not an even grind, some perfectly coarse and some fine as baby powder all mixed together. I wanted to return it but my husband didnt, I am now shopping for another grinder because I don't like silt in my coffee, my husband doesn't care.If I was using this grinder for a drip machine I would be giving it 4 or 5 stars. It grinds fast, it's clean and easy to use. We having been using it for almost a year and it has performed the same as the day we got it."
3,Good value for the money,"This burr grinder is good, but I have to admit that I can't see much difference between the fine and coarse grind settings. I was grinding beans for my french press, so I chose the coarse setting, but I was surprised that the grounds seemed more powdery than they should be. I looked in the guide for troubleshooting, and none of the suggested adjustments/solutions seemed to be the answer. Even though I was hoping for a more coarse grind, I find that the coffee still tastes good. So, overall I would say that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages."
3,Krups GVX1-1 Burr Grinder,"While this grinder does a wonderful job with the basic need, some of the features appear to be non-functional. The dial to control the amount of coffee ground for the number of cups selected does not seem to have any purpose - it does not stop the grinding at any particular point. Overall, I am happy with the grind so can deal with the lack of functional features."
1,Poorly designed,"Pice of crap, Don't by this grinder. Stopped working properly after 3 days. What happened with the quality of Krups? Very disappointed."
1,Used for a year,And then it broke but since i bought it on ebay it wont grind until u shake it little ..i thought all small grinders like that untill i bought a bodum there is no comparison between both of them the bodum wins all the way and the reason is :the bodum grinds without the need of shaking it.....krups espresso machines are good but not this grinder........there is other minor problems such as the coffee ground had static on krups and was flying outside the bottom you dont see much of this in the bodum
4,Does a good job,"The Grind is great, but the ground coffee bin is a bit messy. The safety switch prevents grinding if not set just right."
1,"Inconsistent amount of grounds produced, messy",Very annoying. You have to press on the lid or it stops grinding. The hopper is so small you have to fill it every time if you make a full pot. It spills lots of grounds on the countertop even if you are very careful.
2,Messy,"I bought this grinder elsewhere, but it is the same grinder. I keep it in a pie place because it is so messy. Occasionally the beans get stuck in it, but shaking it a bit while it grinds keeps that from happening too often. This is not my first grinder, but it will be my last one like this. I would prefer it didn't make a mess all over my counter."
4,Just Right,"Just the right size, just the right setting from 1 to 12 cups and just the right grinding settings. Only negative is that emptying the ground coffee can be messy. Shopped around and decided Amazon was the best way to buy it. Which was just the right way to go."
5,"Krups GVX1-14 Burr Grinder , Black",Have bought a few coffe bean grinders and so far this is the best for the price.
2,blah cheap pos died,"A very LOUD machine! It died in a year after daily use. I have since gotten a Breville burr grinder and it is far superior and still works! Oh, and the breville is much quieter, too...."
4,Good coffee grinder,"Compared to my previous grinder, braun kmm30 burr grinder, this is much quiter, smoother. It has nice blue LED in the middle of the power button. Overall quality is very good. But it has a couple of problems. First, the most coarse grinding setting is still too fine for drip coffee makers. But it makes fine powder for espresso machines, so if you use this mainly for espresso machines, it is not a real problem. Second, the smallest quantity setting is still too much if you want to make just two cups of coffee. For smaller quantities, you have to time it and push the button once again, then it stops. But, overall, these are just minor inconveniences for me."
4,Quality Product,I've had this grinder close to 1 yr. Nowadays...if a product lasts a year...you're doing good. This grinder is a work horse...I like the safety mechanism...'it won't grind if the hopper is not in the right position.' This feature can save a lot of accidents if you have small kids like I do..who love to press buttons at random. Also...it's sturdy..not too noisy & grinds up a great batch of beans every time. My only complaint with this grinder...& it is minor...is that when you set the grind texture to 'Fine' ...it takes very long to grind & would fill up the hopper if you were attempting to make enough beans for a 10 or 12 cup pot. Since I do so rarely...it's not a huge deal..& I've found that with this particular grinder...the beans grind best with the setting closer to coarse than fine. If I had to buy again..I'd buy this one again...& I'd definitely buy it for a gift as well.
3,Messy but adequate for the price,I think it does better than my old blade type did. It is very messy though. This far messier than my old style blade grinder. I make pressed coffee and it grinds a good grind for that. I probably wouldn't buy this one again.
4,Awesome!!,"I just don't get it. Some people complain about anything. This little wonder works as expected. It is fast, not noisy and never EVER had this fine powder coffee out of a blade grinder. Therefore, my capuccino tastes better than ever. Additionally, you'll get the most out of your beans, no coarse leftovers like with the blade units.Obviously, there are better and more accurate burr grinders out there but they start at $130....Some reviewers complain about static, mess......, well, with a little common sense I manage to overcome this issue just hitting it kindly after the coffee has been ground, therefore all the coffee will fall into the container. Hitting it kindly also help if for any reason no coffee beans get to the burr grinder.It is a well made coffee grinder and it looks great as well."
1,krups burr grinder,"If you like french press coffee, don't waste your money, purchased the Krups burr grinder to grind coffee beans to make french press coffee, even at the lowest grinding setting, it grinds the beans too fine for use with a french press coffee pot"
1,uneven grind and what a mess it makes!,"The grinder won't grind finely or evenly, and makes a mess on the counter and in my coffee maker when I try to transfer the purportedly ground coffee from the grinder to the pot. Also, the beans don't always move into the grinding chamber, and sometimes it runs without beans. And I have only used it for a week!"
2,High Maintenance,I have a high opinion of Krups coffee machines but this grinder doesn't make the cut. The main problem is the beans don't continue to grind. The blades continue to whirl but the bean get stuck in the chamber so you have to shake the whole machine to continue the process.
1,disposable?,"I bought this a couple of years ago. It did not ""do"" all that I thought it would or should but I kept it. Now I sit with a broken appliance. The on/off button is broken, I tried to take it apart and fix it, but thats an impossible task. I don't think a two year life span is enough. Guess I have to go buy another one - rest assured it won't be a krups."
1,Save your money and buy something else.,"I purchased this coffee grinder a month ago and all I can say about it is save your money. I had an old (30+ years)Krups grinder and absolutely loved it, but this grinder is worthless. I like a fine ground coffee, which is pretty much impossible to achieve with this grinder. I have even tried running the grinds thru it several times and it still fails to produce the same quality as my old grinder. Before purchasing the Krups, I bought a Mr. Coffee brand that worked way better, however the motor burned out after only a couple of months. I decided to go back to the Krups for the quality. Very disappointed and would not recommend to anyone unless you like an extremly course grind."
2,"Makes a huge mess, gets grounds everywhere","Every time you pull the cup out to get your grounds, they spill everywhere. If you remove the little lid that is covering the grounds, they fly everywhere. GIANT mess. Also, even if you select Coarser grind, it still grinds it very fine, like for espresso. Not worth the money. Next time I would get a much better one. I thought this would be great since I bought it at Costco, I won't trust their judgement anymore."
2,quit running,I owned one of this grinders for about 6 months and was very satisfied with it until one day it just decided to quit running. Tried everything to get it to run again with no luck. I won't buy Krups products again.
1,Huge Disappointment,"Have almost always had Krups coffee makers and based on past use with them bought this burr grinder. Absolutely hate it - I don't know why they bother to put number of cups because this thing just grinds until it is empty - on the days it is willing to even start. It also grinds the beans all the same - want coarse, want fine, want a medium grind -- just use any setting because they all come out the same. And the mess is unreal. I really don't want to start my day cleaning out the sink or the counter or the floor because this stuff flys everywhere. If I could give it less than 1 star I would. If you are still considering this grinder buy it on Amazon as the price is the best. Unfortunately we purchased at a regular retail store and paid $[...] for this piece of junk."
1,Never worked properly,"Out of the box the product never ground the proper amount of beans. It would either grind too little amount, or it would jam and keep grinding all the beans regarless of the setting. We sent it back after a week of use and at least a couple of hours trying to get it to work."
2,Not good for the price,"I had to return it. It does not grind well (as in coarse) enough for french press, makes a lot of dust instead. Receptacle container is made of cheap plastic that causes coffee grounds and dust cling to it.If you're looking for a garden variety grinder for medium fineness (for drip), $15 blade-type models would do the job for a fraction of price."
2,"grind select failed, then timer","I bought this item about 18 months ago. After about a year of use, the grind selection failed, and it always produces a rather coarse grind. Then more recently the timer has stopped working, so I count to fifteen and turn it off by hand. This was a very inexpensive burr grinder, and while surely I was unlucky, it was too good to be true."
1,beans won't continuously fall to grind- wished I had not purchased,"We are about ready to toss this one into the garbage. The beans don't fall into the grinder. I have to constantly shake it to get it to work. At first this would happen sparingly, but it's progressively worse after only a few months.For the price we paid, I'm surprised and disappointed by the quality of this grinder.We'll be looking for a new one that isn't this model."
2,not working at all,"i bought this product to grind coffee and spices but that did not work at all. Though ""more than 10 different levels of fineness"" claim is there, you only get unevenly coarse coffee/spice all the time. The container-plastic also somehow got ruined and is not transparent anymore. And if you want to grind very small quantities, it does not grind at all!!!"
1,"Great grinding, Horrible static","I bought this grinder because I wanted the ability to control the grind of my coffee better since I brew drip coffee during the week and french press on the weekends. I also thought having a bean hopper would be useful. I like the design and construction of this grinder and I have no complaints about the way it grinds coffee (although I wish the bean hopper were bigger), BUT I'm going to get rid of it as soon as I can because the static electricity is such a problem. I can't open the container where the grounds go without the static immediately throwing grounds all over my counter. I'm tired of my counters being constantly covered in a thin film of ground coffee. I'm done with it and this is going to the thrift store as soon as I find a suitable replacement."
1,KRUPS Burr Grinder GVX1-14 stopped working,"I bought my KRUPS Burr grinder through Amazon on April 26, 2005.It stopped working on August 31, 2005. The blue light goes on, but the motor doesn't. Glad I used a credit card to purchase - there is a good chance I can recover something."
1,Don't bother with this one!,"I have purchased two of these in the past 9 months. The first worked ok for a while. Most of the time, the beans jammed and stopped falling into the burr. Which was alright, just can't walk away. This also means that the cup measuring feature is useless. Then, the machine would work without the lid on it - with no apparent blockage on the lid saftety sensor. Then after 6 months, it died altoghether. Krups said they would possibly fix it if I sent it back at my cost. And then I am out of a grinder for a while. I regretfully opted to then try another one. Same problems with the second one, but luckily within the 30 day Amazon return policy. Back it went!"
2,Does not produce a grind for a French press!,As the title suggest if your buying this to grind for a french press you will be disappointed. Works ok for a drip grind but that's it.....Get what you pay for I guess....
1,Krups Burr Grinder Review,"we have had this type of grinder before and loved it. However this one seems to be defective. You cannot get a fine enough grind with it, even when you put it on the ""finest"" setting. I am planning to return it and get my money back!"
2,Works great for a total of SIX WEEKS!,"The coffee I was making with this grinder was an immediate and big improvement over using my previous grinder. Whether it was for a french press, espresso or drip coffee this grinder did a great job... for a total of SIX WEEKS! Then it just stopped working altogether. Very disappointing. I've boxed it up and mailed it prepaid to a Krups service/repair center somewhere in New York state. The only other option is returning it to Amazon for a partial refund."
1,Disappointing,"The price is right, until you realize that the grinder doesn't last more than about 20 uses. I've had two of these, eventually replaced it with another model."
3,"Good grinder, but didn't last...","I bought this grinder a little over a year ago, and you would think that for the price it would last a little longer than the amount of time I had it. Before this grinder, I had a blade-style grinder that lasted for years before it gave up the ghost (including two years of frequent coffee-making in college). Don't get me wrong, while it lasted, this grinder was great! Easy cleaning, fairly quiet operation, and automatic settings made it extremely convenient and it took the measuring out of coffee-making. You do need to make sure you clean the hopper and blade frequently, though, otherwise the beans tend to get hung up in the hopper. If you have the will to spend the money, however, I would recommend a higher quality grinder that might have better odds of going the distance."
2,Warning - May Breakdown,Be careful if you purchase this product. In 2 years you may not be pleased.I purchased the Krups GVX2 coffee grinder a little less than 2 years ago. The grinder often did not completely grind my beans even if the settings were correct. I would need to shake the contents to complete grinding. A few days ago the motor slowed and then stopped working altogether. I am out $60 after a mere two years of use. I purchased the reliable and simply designed Krups 203 model which is less expensive and will last me many years.The coffee produced by the GVX2 is fine but not better than the more basic grinders. It is very disappointing when an appliance breaks after 2 years of normal use.
1,WARNING!! Bad Grinder.,"Krups does a great job with coffee makers. They should have stuck to what they do well. This is the worst coffee grinder I have ever had. After a few moments of grinding, this grinder will stop feeding beans into the grinding mechanism. You can shake it (which usually causes it to stop), you can remove and clean the grinding mechanism (as I just did)....Nothing helps. It grinds beans when it wants too and doesn't when it doesn't want to. Today it took 5 to 10 mins to grind the beans. Beating them between rocks would have been quicker."
1,Works well but not for long,"I purchased this grinder on May 7 and by mid June, I'm having problems with it. The dial that regulates the amount of beans to grind does not work. It just keeps grinding until all of the beans are gone which totally defeats the purpose of having your own grinder. So I called Krups warranty center, and they happen to have a service center locally. They will get around to looking at it 7-10 days after they receive it. In respect to what others have said about static. I agree and LOTS of it. I purchased this machine for coffee grind but I can only imagine how it would be with a fine espresso grind. It's a very messy machine, if you don't mind having to clean the unit and the counter after each use then this won't be an issue for you. I can live with cleaning up after it but I'm really irritated that it has stopped working properly with light use as we only use it 3-4 times per week. In my opinion, a cheap rip-off, don't waste your money."
2,"Decent enough, when it works","This thing grinds coffee decently when it is not broken. The power button is flimsy to say the least. We have had two of these and the power button has broken off, just pushes right into the grinder, on both of them.I would think that there would be something behind the button so when it's pressed it doesn't disappear into the grinder, but I guess not.Why did I get a second one? Because I thought the first one was an aberration, I was wrong."
1,Messy & unsafe,"I am totally disappointed when I first use this grinder. Coffee grind leaks and mess up my counter. I thought I didn't close the collection bin tight enough but seems like there is nothing I can do to fix it. I don't think I will keep the product and keep cleaning counter every time I use it. Fine grind is not fine enough so I guess it is only good for french press. Also, the upper cover is very hard to open. Lastly, the front panel around the power button produce heat when it is not in use. I believe the electric circuit is not properly engineered."
4,"No muss, No fuss","Simple easy and efficient, does what you want, grinds coffee perfectly. Its clean modern design and controls are easy to use. The automatic grind feature eliminates the need to stand by and wait while your beans are grinding. I'd recommend and buy another one if I had to do it again."
1,Designed by an idiot,"This was a replacement for a Cuisinart that died, actually three that died, and this was the worst choice I could have made. The grind is never even and when you take out the grind container, it drops ground coffee grounds everywhere. Just don't buy it."
1,"Cheap Plastic ""CHINESE JUNK""","At one time the name KRUPS meant something which is why I chose this coffee grinder, but after endless clog ups it finally bit the dust and burned up after 4 months of very little use and is now resting in the local land fill."
1,Cheap and messy!,"We are so disappointed in this coffee grinder. To begin, if there is a difference in the many coarseness settings, we can't see it. The coarseness seems to come out the same with every setting. Next, the plastic is extremely cheap and breakable. The plastic lid is already cracking and the drawer has chipped in several places. But the part that frustrates me EVERY day is when you pull out the drawer after grinding, coffee grounds fall all over the counter so you have to wipe up grounds every time you pull the drawer out. My last coffee grinder was a cheap $10 grinder and it worked great for years without any of the above complaints. Whomever at Krups designed this machine should be fired."
2,not coarse enough for French Press,"This grinder does not grind coarse enough for French Press. Also, the shortest time interval is too long if you only want 2 scoops of beans."
2,Disappointing,Do you want a grinder that the beans get clogged when grinding and needs to be tapped or shook 1 out of 10 times you use it? Get this grinder!!Do you want a grinder that has a power button that is warm to the touch when it is NOT in use? Get this grinder!!Do you want a grinder generates lots of static so that the grounds stick to the inside of the hopper and get everywhere when you tray and empty it? Get this grinder!!
1,Fool me twice . . .,"This is a decent coffee grinder as long as it works. My experience is that it won't work for long.My wife and I grind our coffee every morning. Let's call each use a 'cycle'. I've purchased two of these units. The first worked well for about 300 cycles. . . unfortunately it died soon after the expiration of the warrantee, so I tossed it and purchased another, hoping that I just got a bad motor in the first unit.The replacement only lasted 3 months (call it 70 cycles) before giving up the ghost. I'm sending this unit to the service center, hoping that the problem is fixed, or a replacement is sent. My opinion is that the ""thermal fuse"" has blown and it requires service at the Krups svc. center to fix it. The prior failure was identical to this one and I feel this model is not cooled properly, or that the motor is undersized for the task, or both.Bottom line - You get what you pay for, and this unit is too cheap to last."
2,Not so great,"This was difficult to operate. The hopper top did not open easily and needs to be replaced ""just so"" for it to operate. I did not find that the grinds varied that much despite changing the setting. I shortly donated it to a thrift store. Also, Costco sells for about $30."
2,Short lifespan,"Okay, so you just can't help getting coffee on the counter with all that static. That didn't bother me too much over the course a full ten months and one week of its decent performance. The little button you turn it on with collapsed inside and you can't get into the unit to put it back. It's still under warranty, so I can drive to and from the nearest service center...just less than 65 miles (2 times). There are all of four authorized service centers in California! Wow, that is service! Or I can box it up, take it to the post office, pay to mail it, wait a year or two and hope I see it again. But...I guess I have to buy another grinder if I want coffee before spring. Save your money for something with a five star review.I want to add that I had purchase one of these for a friend, and her's didn't even last as long as mine."
3,COFFEE GRINDER,"Coffee grinderIt does not grind coffeefine as it should.Also it makes more noise then any grinderI ever used,and that is several.nbm,.bnm, fghjkvxcghjkl;nm,cvghjvbj"
2,Creates a mess!,"This grinder does a good job but it's a horrible mess to clean up. There's so much static buildup that once you remove the lid, coffee grind starts flying out. It's just a mess and a waste of coffee grind. I called Krups to see if they have fixed this issue but it seems they are still making it this way and don't plan on changing it."
2,Messy coffee grinder,"This grinder is messy As you take out the bin from the body inevitably coffee frinds spill on the surface of the counter. The bin lid is flimsy as one gets coffee grinds on the fingers when trying to open. Finally, it does not have a very fine grind for Turkish or similar coffees. I would not buy it again"
2,Had to be faulty,"We had a similar coffee mill prior to getting this one. The button on our old one broke off and fell inside. It lasted several years and worked well for us.This one must have had something wrong with it. On the same settings as our old one, it would grind maybe a third of the coffee at most. And despite setting the grind as coarse as possible, we still got a grind that was too fine and dusty. Adjusting the coarseness of the grind seemed to have no affect on the outcome.Not sure if this is just a cheap, weak model, or if we just got a bad one. But it was not usable, and was returned for a refund.**UpdateI decided to order the Mr. Coffee Automatic Burr Mill Grinder to replace this one... it got / gets better reviews than this one and is actually $10 cheaper!**Update 2The Mr. Coffee grinder works fairly well. We are happy with it.. and the bin is really big and holds lots of coffee, the grind has reasonable variability from the coarse to the fine grind."
1,Will not produce different grind coarseness,"Although this thing has 16 different settings for how fine or coarse you want your coffee ground, regardless of the setting it ALWAYS grinds to about the same degree of coarseness: that for a drip coffee maker. It WILL NOT grind coarse enough for press-pot (french-press) coffee, nor will it grind fine enough for espresso. Unless all you make is drip coffee, do not purchase this.I followed the Krups directions for dealing with this problem to no effect. It simply does not grind to different coarseness."
1,Not for the long haul,"This machine does a nice fine grind, gives you a lot of control, and is easy to use, BUT after two years of use, the on/off button broke, and Krups won't replace or repair it free after the 30-day warrantee is up. Is it too much to expect a machine that costs this much to withstand more than two years of normal use by two two-cup-a-day coffee drinkers? Apparently so. It's back to the inexpensive blade grinder for us. Our last one (a Bodum) lasted ten years."
1,Poor excuse for a coffee grinder,"Leaves a mess of grounds on kitchen counter.Quickly overheats if grinding more than a few cups and stops working.Has to be sent into service center to repair thermal fuse!!Forget that, it's going in the garbage where it belongs."
2,Nice while it lasts,"I have had two of these. Each lasted only ~6 months before it broke. We make about 1 pot a day, so not too heavy use. Too bad, cause it is a cute little machine."
3,Disappointed,"This coffee grinder worked very well up until about 3 weeks ago, 2 years after we bought it. The on button on the front dislodged and so made the grinder inoperable! Will not buy it again."
2,Don't buy it if you want a French Press grind,"I bought this grinder to use with my French Press, but wouldn't recommend anyone buy it except for really fine grinds. Sure it's reasonably priced for a burr grinder, but it ALWAYS grinds too finely for anything but use with some sort of coffee filter (drip, percolation), espresso, or Turkish. I also found the grind lacked any uniformity, so I would end up with both medium grounds and fine powder in the same batch. Only buy this grinder if you're not very picky about your coffee or if you brew some sort of coffee that has a filter to protect you from the always-too-fine grind that the GVX1-14 produces."
2,OK...but not great,I have owned this grinder for less than 3 years. I use it 4-5 times a week on average. I grind only for myself.Last week I pushed the grind button and it disappeared inside the grinder.I sent it to a certified Krups repair and was notified that the parts necessary to repair were no longer available (remember it is less than 3 years old and this model is still for sale).I would urge potential buyers to shop around and spend a little more for another manufacturer.
1,Fails To Automatically Grind Coffee,"Two requirements for consistently brewing coffee are consistently grinding the coffee and using the same amount of ground coffee each time.The coarseness of the ground coffee is consistent but the amount of ground coffee produced varies widely from batch to batch. The quantity setting adjusts the time the grinder runs. The beans often stop feeding into the burrs. Shaking the grinder clears the jam, but unless you hover over the grinder you are often left with as little as half the desired amount of ground coffee.Hardly the automatic process desired."
3,Good but fragile,"I bought this coffee grinder about six months ago. Though it was noisy and the beans often jammed in the grinder, it did a good job. But within three months the start button fell into the grinder and couldn't be retrieved. I managed to start the grinder by using the end of the handle of the brush that came with the machine, but today the machine stopped working because another part fell off. I would not recommend a product that falls apart in such a short time. My blade grinder never broke down, but now that I've tried a burr grinder I'm convinced that they are much better than blade grinders."
4,"Recommended for price, noise and ease of use","It is true that this grinder might not produce a grind coarse enough to avoid sediment if you are using a french press, but if all you are using it for is to fill your drip coffee maker, you should be quite satisfied with the results. This grinder is much quieter than any blade grinder, and simple controls let you set it and it will be ready for daily use by just pressing the power button. This grinder also produces much less static than other grinders that I have used, and I haven't noticed any fresh grounds escaping all over my kitchen counter. Interlocks prevent the grinder from operating if everything is not in place, which should prevent any inadvertent mess. As far as I can tell, the (all) black model is the same as the stainless and black model, except that the all black unit is much cheaper. After a month of daily use, I have had no problems!"
2,Problems Starting,"When it grinds, it's great. But shortly after we got it, we started having problems getting it to start grinding. The problem is apparently that pieces of coffee beans easily get stuck near the switch mechanism. We are constantly having to dig them out with the brush supplied with the unit. Currently, there's something that's stuck in there that we're having trouble getting out and, in order to get the grinder to start, it's necessary to apply massitve pressure to push the cover down and activate the switch. I can't push down hard enough to get it to run; my husband has to do it.But when it grinds, it does a really good job....."
1,better off with a coffee grinder,I didn't like this product at all. It wasn't grinding according to the setting. We like French press coffee that requires coarse grind but this machine certainly did not do that. Even though it has a dial to select the type of ground it failed to do that. It only gave us a fine ground.
2,Gets the job done,"This grinder gets the job done but has a number of flaws. Were I to do it over I would probably go ahead and shell out the cash for a better model. The major issue with this product are that it randomly stops grinding sometimes, owing to the safety mechanism that requires the top to be on for the machine to run is very sensitive. As a result you have to stay by the machine and put constant downward pressure on the top for it to run. The machine also requires the occasional shake when the beans in the hopper get jammed. I also find the grind setting to be quite off. The most coarse setting available is appropriate for drip coffee but there is no way to grind coffee appropriate for french press."
1,Krups Burr Grinder,Used this thing a total of about 10 times and it stopped working.Still using my old one from big lots I got for $6 5 yrs ago.Overated as far as noise and ease of use. Container hard to get out sometimes Did not really see any difference in coffee taste.
1,Grinds too fine,"I read and followed the instructions to the letter, and made very sure to install the top burr correctly, but the Krups GVX2 grinds coffee too fine. The grind coarseness control has no effect either way. The coffee is too powdery to use in a French Press. Disappointing... it's going back and I will look for a different brand."
1,Walk away,I bought this grinder and a few days later it died. Before that however it delivered some substandard espresso grinds so at least I wouldn't miss it much. I suppose I should be grateful.
1,"Looks Great, Poorly Constructed and Very Disappointed","First machine purchased was returned when all setting gave talcum powder grind coffee. The second machine broke three months out of warranty when the cool looking blue button you push to turn on the machine just flat out collasped into the inside of the machine. On closer inspection, the button is held in place by a weak piece of plastic that broke off. No, I will not buy another one. They look good but are failure prone. There are better choices."
2,"Fair grinder, but didn't last.","I received this grinder as a free promotion when I bought a Krups coffee maker. On the plus-side, it lasted longer than the coffee maker, but only by a few months. Both were dead after 18-months. The grinder worked well before it died, although the static-related discharge of coffee grinds gets old after awhile. I am looking at buying the all glass and steel Kitchen Aide in an attempt to get away from the static issue."
4,good grinder,"really good machine, just the lid of the coffee tank is not really user friendly, fall really easly in the coffee. otherwise, it is perfect."
1,A pain to use,The coffee beans jam up over and over again during use and the machine winds up grinding air. You will have to stand by it during use and give it a good whack when the beans stick. I have to pick the whole machine up and bang it on the counter to get the beans flowing again.
2,not my first choice,"I had a Cuisinart burr coffee grinder that I loved, however, it died after about 6 months... when the local store didn't carry it anymore, I tried this one... it grinds coffee well, has nice consistency, but it drives me nuts that I have to constantly shake it to make sure the hopper feeds the grinder with beans... I just ordered another Cuisinart and will be returning this one..."
2,Bad Grind Quality,"This grinder is not suitable for espresso and other coffee beverages requiring a fine grind. Grinder has extremely inconsistent grind that is not much better than a $10 blade grinder. If you want a grinder adequate for espresso with a more even grind consider buying a Solis Maestro, Capresso 560.01 infinity, or other more expensive grinder. ."
2,Over-rated,"I went the distance and paid more for this coffee grinder after having a regular blade Krups for 15 years, thinking it would grind my coffee better and more efficiently, and looked like it wouldn't be as messy. It is a pain in the neck, it is messy, it doesn't grind my coffee any better, and in fact, takes more coffee per pot.I would not recommend it...a $20 blade grinder is better."
1,Not for French Press,"I bought this to use with my Bodum French Press, but even using the coarsest setting it leaves a significant amount of sludge in the coffee. An email to Krups customer service went unanswered. I've had no choice but to return it."
1,Enjoyed it while it lasted,"I felt this grinder was attractive did a good job, but after 8 months, the power button has stopped functioning. For the price, I would expect to get years, not months out of the product."
3,OK but not great,"The grinder is not that big as one reviewer felt. It is reasonably quiet and fast, and I don't have any problem with grinds getting everywhere. The motor seems plenty macho to rip through the beans that come its way. The problem is that it doesn't feed beans into the grinding mechanism reliably so you have to open it up and poke the beans down into the grinder from time-to-time. It's not a very big issue, but it is a continuing one and we've never had a grinder before that did this."
3,Just OK,"I purchased this unit several months ago and have had no trouble with it. It is a good size, holds plenty of beans, and runs fairly quiet. The automation in nice once you get your settings down. However, it seems to never get the grind course enough for a French press, or even if you like the grind a little rougher. The grind size isn't uniform for the courser settings, either. For espresso, I believe that it would work great, it can get down to really fine grinds, however I have not used it for this. Another problem with this unit is that it has too many grinds escaping the recieving bin and makes a mess. Then the plastic bin collects a lot of static and the grinds fly out of it once you open the top. By far this is this biggest problem.In the end its just OK, but what is really nice about it is that it is automatic. I have mine at the office and that way there is never a bad pot of coffee regarless of who makes it. Just hit the button and its going to be right."
3,"Shake it, Shake it ...",The grinder is very good except that the beans get stuck during the grind and we have to end up shaking the machine to get things going again. Did not expect a 60 dollar grinder to do that.
3,"Meh, bottom-of-the-line burr grinder but better than blades","Notably better than the spinning-blade type that is only fit for spices, but not a very good burr grinder. Yields 10% - 25% finely powdered coffee no matter the coarseness setting (although it acurately controls the other 90% - 75% of the output.) Easy to unjam if it clogs (just tap it down on the counter, works for me...) Doesn't like to shut off, and doesn't really ""measure"" amount ground well; just pour in what you want to grind, or turn it off manually when it has sucked down enough beans. (Forget looking into the grinds bin while it is running... too many fines stick to the front so you cannot really see in...) Made well enough and does an ""ok"" job for casual home use."
3,Fine powder on coarsest setting,"I agree with the negative reviews--this thing struggles to make an even coarse grind. There is always some superfine powder which ends up as bitter sludge in the bottom of my cup after downing a batch of french press. Not ideal.I found a way to reduce this powder: Remove/unscrew the top part of the mill from the hopper. With the machine set to the coarsest setting, barely screw it back in, (just enough 'til it catches and won't pull back out) The space between the mill surfaces is a little sloppier, thus giving you *slightly* a coarser grind. Still, I would say, the result is what you would want for drip coffee.Still a decent grinder though, easy to use etc."
1,Loved it until it died after three months of once a day uses,"I absolutely loved this grinder. Wish the hopper was bigger to hold more beans, but that was my only complaint. It was really, really nice. Until 90 days, almost to the day, it just died. It go used once a day for those 90 days, less the three week vacation we took, so it worked for an entire 69 days."
1,I truly hate this thing,"I've had this grinder for almost two years -- from the other reviews here, I see that I am not alone in my pain.First and foremost, it's messy. There is no way to remove the drawer of ground beans without leaving a little pile of grounds on your counter, and then no good way to get the rest of the grind from the drawer into the coffee maker without getting a bunch more on your hands (and coffee maker, and in the water reservoir, ...). It's maddening.Second, it doesn't feed the beans into the grinder consistently. I have to babysit the thing or give it a gentle shake for the whole time it's grinding, otherwise it will stop feeding beans and issue a loud angry whirring sound instead.Third, it doesn't have the decency to just break so that I have a good excuse to replace it."
1,Cooks your beans . . . then dies,"Two major cons:1)This machine heats itself when left plugged in. Any beans left in the chamber are cooked.2)My motor died in less than 6 months, even though I used it to prepare only a few tablespoons of grounds 3 or 4 times per week.I have read several other reviews of this machine on other sites which mirror my experience."
4,Krups Burr Grinder a great buy.,I just got through buying my second Krups burr grinder. The first one lasted for 6 or 7 years. The only problem I have had with it is the safety interlock switches are a little touchy and one has to jiggle the top and receiver around sometimes to get it to start. Otherwise a great buy.One comment regarding the static cling experienced by several people. A easy way around this is to thoroughly wash the plasitc receiver/lid. Let them dry and then wipe the inside of the parts with fabric softener sheets. This will eliminate any cling for about a month. For those of you who may be concerned about safety I have looked up Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for softener sheets and cannot find any harmful contents in the sheets. I would encourage you to look it up yourself if you are at all concerned.
4,"Sturdy, yet 1 design flaw",This grinder is a good buy with flexibility to choose both grind fineness and quantity (of cups). The one issue is that the lid has an automatic shutoff if it is not closed--and unfortunately I have to apply a little pressure to the top throughout the grinding cycle to keep it running--if I let go the safety switch loses contact and the appliance stops. This switch may become less sensitive with age (hopefully).
5,from me.,I really like this product! My coffee goes further now that it's a consistent grind. I'll never own a grinder again! The burr is SO much better.
4,Good Grinder,"After receiving two ""repackaged"" products that were either missing parts or didn't work, Amazon made good within a day or two. I've owned Krups grinders and they are good. Good choice on the grind level and reliable. The start button tends to wear out which prompted the replacement. A little pricey for the quality but a good grinder for as long as it lasts."
1,Not for French press users,I'm returning this Krups grinder. Wish I read the reviews before I bought it. This grinder does NOT cut a coarse grind which I need for my French press. I'm going to buy a Bodum grinder. French press users don't waste your money on this grinder.
1,"Poor design, one degree of grinding","This burr grinder will only grind fine coffee, will NOT grind medium or coarse. Because most of the grinder is PLASTIC there is a severe static problem and the only grind coffee that you get sticks in the container for the ground coffee as well as the in the machine itself. The end result is you get a mess every time that you grind coffee. If you don't mind the mess and if you want only super fine (powdery) coffee then this machine is OK. Krups was not helpful and am returning this machine to where I purchased it at. They have a design problem and don't care as they are hitting a price point with an inferior product.I have been using this machine daily for about 1 month. And am going back to using my old blade grinder - it is simple, works quickly, cleans easily - I can get a medium grind most of the time."
1,Poorly,I've enjoyed this machine in the past but had to replace it when I inadvertently burned its wire. The machine which was sent looked brand new but the one button to operate it didn't work. I had tossed out the packaging because I felt sure there would be no problem. Now the seller tells me it must be sent back to the manufacturer. It is this kind of thing which discourages purchasing via the net; and obviously I would not buy from this seller again.
1,Uneven Grind,All different size chunks after grinding. From course coffee to fine powder. Tried several different settings. Krups needs to invent this thing. I agree with another review. Way easier to get a nice fine more even grind with an inexpensive blade grinder. Shame on Costco for carrying this mediocre attempt at a milling machine.
2,Broke as soon as warranty ran out...,"This grinder was fine...not great...it did occasionally get stuck and spin, but that wasn't a big deal. The problem came when one morning I went to grind my coffee and I pushed the on button and it went all the way into the machine...bye bye grinder...it may be a cheaper Burr grinder, but it is by no means that cheap that it should only last a year...do not buy!"
1,Flat doesn't work.,"It's hard to write a review of a product that simply won't turn on. It looks right. The price is right (Costco a little cheaper than Amazon) and the on/off switch glows a nice blue to tell you the electricity is working. But that's it. No noise. No grinding. No alternative but to drive an hour back to Costco. I'm done with this model, but what to get instead? Reviewers either seem to love this grinder or save up for a gazlion dollar one. It's a pity Medaglia d'Oro no longer tastes the same."
4,Krups Burr Grinder,The grinder works well for the kind of coffee I like to drink (regular). The burr grinder will not burn the beans and the settings are easy to learn.
1,Junk - Stay Away!,"The second time I used this grinder, it barely worked. The power button does not seem to respond, almost like it has a short. Coffee beans were loaded to the max line only and all instructions were followed to the letter. The machine is clean with no beans stuck in it, and yet it took several attempts to even get it started. When it did start, it ground beans for a few seconds and then shut off. I shook it a few times and managed to start it once more. Using this ""method,"" it took at least five minutes to grind one batch of coffee.Some products are just bad and this is one of them. Save yourself time and money; do not buy this product."
3,Lasted 6 months grinding flax seeds,"Bought mine at Costco to grind flax seeds for my fruit smoothies and now my glutten free pancake batter. I was grinding about 4 Tablespoons at a time and it did a great job turning the seeds into flour. Then last week, it jammed, and that burned motor smell waifted through the kitchen and now nothing I do will make it run. It's not meant to be disassembled except at the top where the seeds enter and I did clean that out. The spindle moves freely but it doesn't work.For those of you who get one that right out of the box it doesn't run, be sure that the top lid is fully seated and that the capture box is also fully in place. It won't run unless both are in all the way.Anyway I'm shopping for something else to grind flax seeds."
4,Quality coffee made easy,"While I haven't had this for long so can't speak to it's durability I love the machine. While I find the coarseness setting slightly off (I had to set it coarser than I would have expected for a drip coffee maker to get the proper grind) once set it seems to grind consistently. It looks nice enough that I don't mind it being out on the counter and it stores a decent number of beans, it doesn't vacuum seal so I probably wouldn't want to store too many more at a time anyway."
1,Worst grinder ever!,"This grinder is so messy I can't stand it anymore! I am currently searching for a replacement. The fine coffee grounds get all over the place, especially when I remove the collection bin lid. Save yourself the hassle and don't bother....my friend just replaced hers for the same reason."
2,Don't bother,"While this did an acceptable job grinding, the mess was awful. The ground coffee is deposited into a container and when you remove it, coffee grounds spill everywhere. I returned it to Costco"
4,"Grinds very well, with a minor issue","This grinder does grind very well, and can get it fine enough for a magnicent espresso. The only issue is that if it doesn't sense any beans near the bottom it'll spin fast and then shut down. I have to shake the grinder to get the beans to settle down and get it grinding again before it stops itself. All in all though, it's been over two years and it still grinds perfectly, and I've recommended one for a relative as well."
1,Do NOT buy this grinder.,"This is a terrible product. It jams constantly. Worse, it doesn't really grind. It just hacks the beans into big chunks - too big to extract all the flavor. Which means you need to add more coffee. Which means you spend more money and -- because it constantly jams - means you also spend much more time making your coffee. The Krup GVX 2 is a whole new category of appliance: an inconvenience. Don't buy it. Don't even accept it as a gift. And don't ""re-gift"" it if you're hoping to retain your friends."
3,Krups grinder,Revised 5/21/2010: Don't expect it to last. Bought in Feb 2009 and yesterday the on button went into the housing and now it worthless. I loved it till then. It is just cheaply made. You get what you pay for even though at the time it was rated 4.2 stars. Now I see why it has dropped. Still going to give 3 stars but buyer beware!!!!!Feb 2009: A burr grinder is the best thing ever for a great cup(s) of coffee whenever. Only 1 thing or I might give this one a 5 star. Does not automatically stop if you go past 4 cups. Remember you are grinding beans and the oil is sticky. So make sure you clean on a regular schedule. I do it every 4 days.
2,Grinds Well but Pain to Use,"First the good parts:1. It (usually) does a good job grinding. I use a fine grind and it's great at that.2. It's fast.Now the bad:1. As others have noted, it stops grinding for no reason. I have to unplug it and plug it back in to get it to finish the job.2. As others have noted, the ground coffee sticks badly to the hopper. Static, apparently. When I try to get it out into the coffee maker basket, the grounds fly off in every direction and I end up with coffee everywhere. At least they include a little brush to help get the grounds out of the hopper, otherwise it would be impossible.3. The third time I used it, the upper burr came loose and I had a heck of a time getting it back on with half-ground coffee all over the insides.Bottom line, it's a cheaply made device that does a good job if the stars are aligned properly. I'm trying to decide whether to return it."
2,Spend more and get something better,"This machine was our first experience with a burr grinder. We owned it for a little over a year. One day it just quit. While it worked, as others have said, it got the job done but required a lot of fussing around to find the right settings. Sometimes the beans would get stuck in the hopper and the motor would race. Static cling was often a problem (this seems to be weather-related). It was difficult to remove the top half of the burr wheel for cleaning. The grinder surfaces were small, and the whole thing just didn't seem very durable. I am now in the market for something better."
1,Do not buy.,This grinder is $50.00 worth of junk. The push button used to start the grinder fell down inside the machine after less than 12 months of use. Looks like that happened to someone else as well. The beans do not fall into the grinder like they should and you have to stand by and shake it periodically. Bed Bath and Beyond no longer carries this grinder...I wonder why.
1,Terrible Grinder,"This is a terrible grinder, or at least the one they shipped to me is. From day one I noticed that it would not grind the beans in a continuous manner; the beans wouldn't fall down into the grinding area so it would be grinding air even though there were plenty of beans in there. You can get around that by shaking the grinder gently while it is grinding. But then it stopped working altogether, then it worked one more time and now it comes on sometimes when you push the button but does not grind. The grinding mechanism is 100% plastic, I expected it to be metal.I also have a coffee maker from Krups that has a broken LED display so you cannot set the automatic timer, and the water meter was broken on that from day one. The grinder was a gift but I would NEVER purchase another Krups product.It is not worth spending the money on something you have to send to the landfill after 25 uses.Shop another brand!"
4,Neat lil' set,"Figures are waaaay smaller than I imagined considering the description only gives the box size which is 12"". I have to agree with another reviewer in that they should have included Batman in one of these sets! And why oh why is Wonder Woman the one with the least amount of physical articulation??? Her elbows and knees do not bend and I am not happy about that! But otherwise, I love the new colors for both WW & Superman and it's a good addition to my collection."
1,NOT QUALITY I EXPECTED,I have a set of 500 thread count queen sheets that I purhcased on this webiste that were AWESOME! ... Having bought a King bed I needed new sheets and returned to the website to buy them...I did not have the manufactor of the queen sheets so just shopped the website and purchased these...I followed the washing directions EXACT! ... After washing them ONLY 3 TIMES...the bottom sheet now has tiny fuzz balls on it making it scratchy and uncomfortable to sleep on...I hope to return them and get a refund...will update as soon as customer service gets back with me...
2,Stopped working in 6 months,"Basic machine, functioned satisfactorily for 6 months, but then stopped playing or recording. Tech support said to clean the laser, which I knew was not the problem, and of course $15 later it still did not work. They then said that the laser had gone bad. I could take it in for repair. That might cost more than the machine, but I told them I would consider it since the warranty still covered parts for 1 year. I was informed that the company had decided not to honor the warranty any more!I won't buy another GoVideo product."
5,Great Chanukah book,[...]Hershel and the Hanukah Goblins has been a favorite for years! Kids of all ages love this story and I just bought my third copy!
5,beginning are beautiful,I started JKD and found out that this book was the beginning of my course of study. The book brings the reader the essentials of the system with no fluff. The one part that is most useful about the book is that Mr. Lee tells one not ot try to perform the techniques on a skilled wing chun man. Through out the book advise is given and one should take it . This book is a definate addition to all interested in both JKD and wing chun.
2,Badly written,This book is wonderful for the wing chun student who already knows what he's doing and needs no instruction. For anyone else this book is a mess. several times in the book the author seems to jump to ideas that are misplaced with the original idea. Moreover the book does not do a good job of explaining certain aspects of what you're even doing. For a student who is trying to gain insight into wing chun this book is a thumbs down.
2,"goody theory, poor applications","I feel this book is written with passion, but also with little practice of the art or at least no quality in it: theory is correct, but the photos shown here show little resemblance with the text:stances are pure fancy (look at the yee jee kim jeung mah), footwork is totally wrong and there's no mention of hip's use in it, and please, look at the chun choi at the end of Siu Nium Tao! If you're looking for a theory handbook, you can consider to buy it, but wing chun, in reality, is another thing."
3,"I liked the book, but it's only a good intro!","The book is mostly of applications, but some of them seem to be against principle. This might be because of the fact that the author was not actually trained in Wing Chun. Even though Bruce was a had a part in the book, it still seemed like a departure from real Wing Chun. I liked the many applications, but most of them can be found in good Jeet Kune Do books. There isn't much on the system and of it's principles. If you love Bruce and his followers or just looking to see applications then this is an OK book. I just like to collect Wing Chun Books."
1,publication misprint,"whatever your view of this book,it is important to make sure you have the book in its entirety. i purchase this book on Amazon. The version i got was missing 32 pages. the pages go from 1-32 then it repeats pages 1-32 then it jumps to page 65. it is missin pages 33-64. make sure yo ask the sellers to verify that their editions don't have this problem."
1,Not worth it at all,"The form performed by Mister Lee is way off, his stance makes him look like he wants to fly and one could see he is very rigid. I'm a practitioner of Wing Chun and when I bought this book two or three years ago, I thought it was good. Now practising in a more intense and precise way, I see that not many books on Wing Chun offer much, except for history and principles. If you want superficial Wing Chun buy this, but if you want real Wing Chun, seek out Leung Sheung's main student in San Fran."
3,Stick with the original...,"This album is okay but a lot of the songs don't really add anything new to the original. I don't mind tribute albums if they try to expand on original ideas and not just say ""let's just R&B-ize the songs"". When I listen to this album, I usually just end up wanting to play the Phil Collins albums instead.Also, just out of curious, why does TQ change the lyrics in All of My Life to ""Said Enough"" instead of ""Set 'em up""? Do these people not have the original lyrics? Well, I guess I did say I didn't like it when people were just derivative... ;)"
3,wow,the only good song on here is Deborah Cox version of something happened on the way to heaven and or course her voice is awesome like allways but if you like that song look for the dance remix its even better
3,Witch Costume,This costume is of semi-decent material and is a one size fits all. Needs some sort of ironing to get wrinkles/fold lines from being in a bag out.
4,time waits for no man,"If you own a GE or Telechron clock from the 40's or 50's, this is your encyclopedia. lots of pictures and accurate descriptions."
3,Good Model Reference,"The book contains a lot of good history on the company, the founder, and the advertising/promotion meterials. The section on the ""designers"" gets a little boring. The section on repairing/restoring is interesting and has some good information. There is not a lot of depth to it but for most people, it is more than you'll need. I like the model look up list in the back. The price guide will soon go out of date though, and some of the color photos of the various clocks are horribly green. Overall it's a good book and well worth buying if you are a Telechron enthusiast."
4,An excellent data model primer for major business areas,"This book contains many well thought out 3NF data models for major areas of business. The level of the models is necessarily quite high, but many stimulating approaches to classic problems eg. Party Roles are presented. The book should not be viewed as a data warehousing guide, although it has a 40 page section on moving your 3NF model to the DSS environment, briefly touching on the star schema."
2,OK but too general of info and net very usefull,"After a year's subscription I honestly have to say that I am disappointed. Most of the financial info is the same as some of the websites that get my daily news and from one of the major big box stores that issue a free magazine. The only thing this is really good for and what I got out of it is that it confirms what I already know. After a year's time and a few dollars spent on this, I would rather ask my financial adviser instead of renewing another year.Update. While this subscription may not be for me, I do have to say that for someone who does not have a financial background it would be worth the money because not everyone is familiar with finance and CR is very credible for the general public."
4,"Very Good Publication, Mostly Unbiased","I've been a subscriber for several years and still look forward to getting the publication in the mail and reading it. And I usually read it a couple of times - there aren't a lot of pages so it doesn't take that long. Much of the info is general in nature and is available elsewhere if you keep up with basic financial news and events. But I occasionally pick up a ""gem"" from the publication which makes the cost worth it. I wish it contained more information in each issue (had more pages). And in the title of this review I say ""mostly unbiased"" because every person, organization, and company in the world is biased in one way or another, including Consumer Reports. In conclusion, 4 stars = very good, but not great. Will I continue to subscribe? Yes."
3,Fair,I asked for this subscription as a gift and received it. I've read 5 issues so far and I'm not really that impressed. I like information that allows me to take action to change my financial position and there just aren't enough tips in this expensive publication. It's usually about 5 pages long with a fair amount of information that is not useful or interesting.
2,"Poorly made, bad fit, not really for adult","I just got this. It is really not for an adult. It should be labeled ""teen"" only. The torso is not long enough for an adult. the petticoat was jutting out in odd places from the skirt (poorly made). The bust was too tight. Even though I ordered large, it was too small. The price was steep for the quality."
3,Dorothy Costume,"Turn around time was very good for this item...which was very important, since I needed it in a short amount of time. BUT I was very disappointed in the quality of the costume. First, the style of the costume I received was not as pictured. The skirt was very short and poofy and the bodice was completely different. It is a good thing that I sew because I had to take the skirt off and use part of it for a waistband to make it longer. In addition...one of the straps had the gingham going on an angle and the other one had the gingham going straight... unfortunatley I just had to go with it because I only had a few days. After all I had to do to alter the costume, I really wish I would have just sewed it from scratch. It would have been cheaper and would have been a better quality."
3,itchy,"This costume is cute, but the slip underneath is so itchy...you could die. Also, the waistline on it is made for women about 5 feet tall. I am 5'7 and the waistline ended up under my breasts. They made the costume for women without a torso (mine is of normal size)."
2,Not the same as what is pictured,Costume came quickly but is completely different than the photo and much cheaper looking. Also much shorter and one of the reasons I ordered this was because the skirt did not look short and poofy. Not enough time to send back with the Halloween party so close. Really disappointed in how I was misled based on the pic as it does not represent the actual product you receive.
2,very small size,"We purchased this costume last week for a play this week. It was advertised as being a standard adult size (fits 8-12). When it came it was labeled ""teen"" and it was very small. There is no way it would have fit an adult. Fortunately, it was for my teenage daughter and it just barely fit. BUYER BEWARE--this is very small. It is made by Rubies and the shipper was lynx-lair. It seems to be offered by several different vendors."
4,my costume,"For Halloween me and my friends are being wizard of Oz characters and I am being dorothy. I ordered this costume it came quickly but it turned out a little different than the picture. The dress ended up being long in my opinion because it is a little farther than my knees, the top is little big on me and it is really wrinkly so I will have to iron it. The fabric has good quality and for $27 it was a good deal were I found it at other stores for $40! Also the waist band is elastic so if your not sure that you will fit in a size remember the waist is elastic! I would recommend this for people who want to save money and and who don't mind having too sow a little if needed for you."
2,"Perfect look, horrible fit!","The costume is the perfect look however, the sizing if way off. I ordered a large to be safe and it was still tight to the point where it was uncomfortable. The bands around the arm were made for a medium. I had to wear shorts and a tank top underneath since the elastic wasteband was so uncomfy. I had my costume on for 2 hrs max and had to change to be able to enjoy my party."
1,Disappointing at best,"Quality was very poor. One button was missing, style was not as shown. Hated it so much, I couldn't wear it. Delivery was fast, but overall I am extremely disappointed, and would not order again."
2,very small size,"We ordered the dorothy adult costume last week for a show this weekend. The costume was listed as being adult size standard (fits 8-10) but when the costume arrived it was labeled ""teen"" There is no way it would have fit an adult. Fortunately it was for my teenage daughter and it just barely fit. BUyer Beware--this costume is very small. The manufacturer is Rubies Company. The shipper was lynx-lair.com. It looks like this same costume is sold by several of the vendors."
1,a disappointment,I was very disappointed in this book. The portion sizes are very small. I certainly could not satisfy anyone in my family with a half cup of beef stir fry (noted as the serving size for this receipe). The receipes were good but you must figure on two serving sizes for each person for most main dish receipes. Explanations of food exchanges was very helpful.
3,Buyer Beware,Fine print states that these are recorded by original artists with an original band member but they are NOT necessarily the original hits from the radio. Buyer needs to know this before deciding to buy or not to buy.
5,Lifetime Memories,I was raised on these tales of the wiley rabbit. My mother read me to sleep with The Songs of The South. Being from the heart of Dixie I have a very personal feeling for these wonderful colorful and enlightning tales of old. My middle age has allowed me to pass these tales on to my children and I am now reading them to my Grandchildren. In fact they are in demand from my kids wanting to read them to their children them selves when not convenient to do so by me.Uncle Remus spins a whimsicle yarn and uses old time forgotten vinacular that titilates the imagination to heights that brings a giggle to the staunches personality.The are truly an endless means of allowing imaginations paint colorful pictures and creating cool summer breezes under an old sycimore tree decked out with lazy spanish moss.Highly recommended and truly a milestone in our Southern Heritage and culture of The Old South. Song of The South will endure and hold on like a Mississippi snapping turtle.
5,"This book was really, really great! I loved it!!!!!!!!!!!!","Dear Kids and People, I would like to tell you about this book. If you like fairies and if you are like me and love to read, you will think that it is kind of easy. But if you are 5 or 10 it will be fun. I liked this book because it was really, really full of adventures. I believe in fairies and I think you will too after reading this book. Reviewed by an 8 year old."
3,Some Highpoints in this otherwise mediocre Book,"I am a big fan of Ray Bradbury. There is so much irony in his words. He is one of the last great authors of our time. This collection does not do Him Justice, however. The first story is okay. ""Beasts"", and ""Leftovers"" are lacking in most areas. The ""Dragon danced at Midnight"" is great , ""Fore"" is one of Ray's Best. If you are not familliar with Bradbury's work this is not a very good place to start. Start with ""The Illustated Man"". But for seasoned fans, this is not a horrible book, but not His best works. Still, not bad for His early eighties. Keep on writing, Ray!!"
2,The anti-bradbury,"There's a reason most of these stories had never been published. Ray Bradbury is a master of unveiling events in such a way as to hold the readers interest and keep them guessing. Even until the the end the reader sure isn't quite sure just what is going on and how it will end. His endings are full of ironies that not even the most clarvoyant person can expect. Unfortunately most of these stories lack these tallents. Most of these stories are uneventfull, uninspiring, anticlimactic and contain little or no irony. If you're a Bradbury fan, and want to see a master fail, here's your chance to do it."
3,"Not his best, but still worth reading","I have decided that short stories must be more difficult to write than novels. I absolutely adored Ray Bradbury's Fareheit 451, but his short story collection One More For the Road only had a few good stories. It is also possible that his writing ideas are inversly proportional to his age. Some of the stories were thought provoking, some were entertaining, some were skin crawling, and some were just boring. I would recommend the Illustrated Man as a substitution."
1,i can't believe i bought this book,"What on earth was with the dialogue? No one speaks like that! The storylines were nothing more than tripe, and I regret the fifteen minutes I spent forcing myself to attempt reading this awful array of words written by this so claimed ""fantastic"" author.My expectations of quality were misled by the backcover, and I regret purchasing the book. Never again shall I set sight on this man's awful writing. I would never recommend this book, the short stories, or the author, to anyone. What a waste of valuable reading time."
2,Not What I Was Expecting,"I very much enjoyed Bradbury's Somthing Wicked This Way Comes and The October Country and, even if it was a bit slow moving, From the Dust Returned. I thought One More for the Road would be in the same vein: thought provoking, a little twisted, a little chilling.This book does provoke some thought, mostly on the ends of lives and loves, but it is almost totally devoid of ""chilling"" and ""creepy."" My reaction to most of these stories was, ""Yeah, okay, and . . .???""The cover with its skeleton hitchhiker is totally misleading.I think I'll look for some older, more fun Bradbury."
2,Watch the price!,"Bought this product on the recommendation of a friend. Paid $17.99. The day the product arrived, I noticed it was now priced at $5 less than what I paid. Very disappointing the prices can fluctuate that much within a few days. Especially because I almost didn't buy it because it was such an expensive item."
5,Lets you explore your artistic side while building!,"From advice on 'snuggling' foundation rocks together to practical explanation of creating the right mix..Becky really shows she knows how to work with earth. I began a cob bench after falling in love with photos of hers. I don't know any other way to sculpt, have fun, get dirty, and still create something useful. People might not build a whole house, but a meditation room, or garden shed, even animal house would be doable. Local cobbers I know respect her skills highly, I'd love to see more finished home and project photos. Anyone can do this, it's fun and gets you in touch with dirt!"
5,Lucynda Riley,"I found the book to be very informative. She made the entire process, excluding the plumbing and electrical, very simple and easy to follow. I don't doubt that with a little help with the plumbing and wiring I could also build a cob dwelling. Actually I have made plans to build a round cob excersise and meditation room off of my straw bale home when it is completed. The scuplted walls and window shapes will make for a very peaceful place to exercise and to meditate."
4,Great starter book with info. you won't find in the others.,"I found this book invaluable. With it's simply put illustrations and descriptive nature. It's a simplified context that compliments ""The Hand Sculpted House"" wonderfully! Between these two books and a little research on site and with consideration to additional components of the structure to be erected, I feel confident that even a novice builder (with proper planning and a little guidance from some pro's) could complete a humble starter home of their own. I only speak from my little (16 years as a builder) experience with completing homes. *never built one like this till now* With another couple years of planning and designing, hopefully mine will be completed."
4,Cob Handbook.,I am building a hybrid cob/straw home for my family in the spring. This and several other books have been quite helpful. Especially since I am unable to leave my home and take a work shop.
5,Very pleased,This was a gift for my fiance on his birthday. He loved it. The book has virtually every bit of information one could hope to find about cob building. This is the perfect book if you seriously want to build a cob structure. We are planning on starting small by building a couple of dog houses for our dogs before we actually build our own home. The book is very easy to follow and covers every detail you can imagine. You can tell this is a labor of love for the author and we appreciate her sharing her extensive knowledge so that beginners like ourselves can build a cob structure like an old pro. iIt is definately a must read for anyone seriously considering cob building.
3,PNY Always Reliable,I work in the technical sector and this usb drive is great. I like that it does not have the U3 crap software that takes up space and is useless. You can make your own customized bootable USB key or just transfer data which is what I prefer.
4,Not bad,"Not a bad product, although its own file managing system and program isnt that much of a hassle and pretty simple to work with I prefer to not have it on the drive. It also takes up a little bit of space on the drive as well"
2,Not all it's advertised to be,"I wish 'real' programs would run from this drive. My main issue is that it works in some XP computers and not in others. The cursor just 'flashes' at me forever when I plug the drive in. Great idea, not so great execution."
4,Data Storage Device,Does what I wanted....Would like it better with more capacity..but it beats a CD...would purchase another
5,Great quality t-shirt,"Be careful when ordering the size - runs bigger, so choose a size down from what you wear otherwise is a great quality t-shirt."
5,One of CCM's Best Voices,"I'M A BELIEVER is an uplifting and energetic project that has stood the test of time remarkably well. The gorgeous, soaring voice of Amy Morriss elevates every track and leaves a lasting impression in the best of ways. If you can find a copy of this CD, I highly recommend it for any music lover's collection. There aren't many voices which compare to hers."
2,not a good purchase,It's a decent size cooker for cooking baby food. I don't like it however. The lid is not tight so you can hear the clicking noise of the lid hitting the pot when cooking. It doesn't keep the moisture lock in and food dry out faster than other slow cookers.
4,Counter Candy!!,"This is really cute, and it works too!! It has become one of the kitchen extras that I will leave out on purpose. I wish my toaster and coffee maker looked this good! :) It looks great on the table too."
3,"Perfect for a single, lazy dude","I love this because I can cook all kinds of stuff in it without having to cook a week's worth of food. I love it's size, and I love the fact that it has different heat settings. I wouldn't do it any other way.***Update***As much as I loved the size and flexibility of this little guy, it died after about 7 months of moderate use. I've dropped the rating the reflect my disappointment in the short life of the item. Up until the day it died however, I was very pleased with it. I won't complain too much since they are so inexpensive."
5,Love it,"I love this mini slow cooker. I used it for Thanksgiving to keep the gravy warm. I used it for making oatmeal. The only bummer it you have to wait 2 hours for it... It's a perfect size also to make meals for my 2 year old. Love, love, love, the compact size..."
1,Pot arrived with chip,"Hard to tell whether the Elite is a factory second or whether chips somehow appeared on the inside and outside finish of the crock pot in transit. After having experience using these gadgets, I'd go with an alternate method. I don't believe that slow cooking is an end in itself, and I think that the crockery liner with its unfinished edge at the bottom is a durable or safe idea."
1,A WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME,"I used this item two times and on the seond attempt I noted a burn mark on the bottom of the ceramic bowel. I tried using it today and nothing....no heat at all. It is a waste of money and I wish I saved my information so that I can get my money back. Sr. Marilyn Dunn,OP"
5,mini-crock pot/slow cooker (Maxi-Matic),"VERY NICE LITTLE APPLIANCE! WE USE IT TO MAKE OATMEAL OVERNIGHT...JUST HAVE IT ON A TIMER AND IN THE MORNING, FRESH OATMEAL AWAITS US! SO FAR IT WORKS GREAT! WOULD RECOMMEND!"
3,Works OK,I bought this crock pot to replace my old small one that had gotten broke when I moved. I have two larger crock pots for making meals this one I bought for the sole intention to use for dips. Its' smaller size and shape is perfect for making dips. So that part I like. The first time I used it was to make queso for a party. I put it on the high setting to melt the cheese. Once the cheese was melted and I had added the other ingredients I turned it down to the low setting to keep it nice and warm. This is where I got disappointed after about an hour the queso was starting to burn. I then would have to turn it off for 10 minutes and then turn in it on low for 15 minutes to keep the queso warm and not burned. It worked but was sort of a pain. However the price was cheap enough that I guess you get what you pay for.
3,Too small!,"Too small! I wanted a small crock pot because we are a family of two and don't want too many leftovers but this is too small. I would like maybe one that is two quarts,so you could half most recipes that are for a 2quart crock pot. But its a nice red color and it fits in with my other red kitchen things. It cooked ok,but did run over the side into the inside."
4,So far so good,I've had this crockpot for about a month and it works very well. Made perfect polenta with it last week. I did have trouble with overnight Oatmeal but I am going to give that one another try. The best thing about it is that while most of the small crockpots I have come across do not have multiple heat settings - this one does. And it is pretty enough to keep out on the counter.
5,Best beans and stew ever,"I am disabled and cannot always cook at the stove. This little dandy is a life saver. I can put dried beans or a stew in it and my husband can handle the rest. Since the stoneware can also go in the fridge, he can even be sure the food is put away if there is any left. This is a great size for a couple or small family."
1,Lemon Product?,"I was so excited to receive this crock pot. It came promptly and looked so beautiful right out of the box! BUT...I cooked 1 recipe of pinto beans for my daughters and noticed late in the cooking time that there was a burning smell so I unplugged the crockpot and waited for it to cool. The beans were fine, but on further inspection the inside of the crockpot was burned up! One of the grommets had a hole burned completely through it. I was hopeful to get a good product after much deliberation and after reading pretty decent user reviews about this product, but was dissappointed and just asked for a refund. Hope it was an unusual incident."
4,Nice size to cook for a baby,"We purchased this slow cooker to make baby food and it works just fine! We also use it to cook for ourselves and it is great for just two. On the plus side, it is easy to clean, compact, comes in multiple colors to match other appliances, and the automatic defrost feature is nice. We have only used it a few times, but so far have found no negatives. Overall a good product that does what it is supposed to do."
2,Poor Quality,The slow cooker seems to be of poor quality. When the shipment arrived from Amazon the product box looked like it had been sitting for quite awhile and once I removed the slow cooker I discovered that the insert was scratched and had white spots showing where the red hadn't covered. I've returned the product. Very disappointed.
5,Some strange feeling ...,Awesome ... We go way back ... Part of my site: www.alexray.com is about him!
3,"Maxim Natural Wood Blocks, 100-Pieces","I bought these for my 3-yr. old granddaughter. I had also bought her the Melissa & Doug block set, and the ones from Melissa & Doug are a lot more substantial."
4,Wood Blocks,"These blocks are good quality. The one disappointing thing is that they are quite a lot smaller than I thought I was getting. 100 sounds like a lot , but the squares are tiny ( 1 inch ) and there is 30 of them. I bought these to make an Angry Bird game for my Son. They are light , so they should work great for knocking down."
1,Lilliputian disappointment,"Well not my disappointment so much as my disappointment at these blocks' Lilliputian size. As mentioned in other reviews, these are very small and seem cheap accordingly. I thought I hod got a deal, but it was too good to be true. I would not have bought these if I'd seen them in the store. I'm also somewhat afraid of the potential choking hazard for these things, through if they're not over the line safety standards-wise they're close..."
3,Small,"The blocks were much smaller than I expected. For the price I guess I can't complain too much, but I wish I could find bigger blocks with the same amount for the same price"
1,Edges are sharp.,"These blocks were a good price, but the edges are sharp. Before our children will be able to play with them, WE WILL HAVE TO SAND EACH BLOCK. We will not purchase this again."
1,Do not buy,The wood on these blocks are unfinished and rough to the touch. not worth the money. I love blocks for kids.... But not this brand.I wish I would have paid a few $ more and purchased a better set.
4,Fun toy,I don't know why but I thought this would be a lot larger than it was. Be sure to check dimensions. I had wanted huge blocks but these are rather small (no wonder I was shocked they were so much cheaper than other ones!) Overall its a great toy and I'm only disapointed in my own inability to check dimensions! This is a great addition to any childs stash.
4,Blocks,"They smell weird from the packaging, even after being washed. The smell has disipated some after being aired out for a couple weeks. Blocks are slightly smaller in size than I anticipated but fun none the less."
2,These blocks are tiny.,Blocks are much smaller than expected. They look just like the ones I had as a kid but about 1/6th of the size.
3,Too Small,I should have ordered larger blocks for our little one. They are too small to stack easily for a two-year old. I think he may like them when he gets older.
1,misleading product information,"I just received the Maxim 100-piece Natural Wooden Block set and am sorely disappointed! I was in the market for the large maple preschool blocks that my children played with years ago. What I received is 100 blocks of pine, most of which are less than 1 1/2 in square. I certainly will not give them to my grandson! If I cannot return them, I will toss them out. What a disappointment!"
3,Blocks,These blocks were cheaper than Brio and Brio only had small sets of 100 or more blocks not painted. They are cheaply made and really soft.
3,"Enjoyable, durable toy",My son has had a really good time playing with these blocks. They seem well made and are a nice size so that they don't take up too much space in his room.
4,On the small side,Very nice natural wood block set. The pieces were smaller than I expected. 2yr old likes them. I wanted bigger blocks at first but after we opened them I was glad they were smaller. The box of blocks stores nicely on our book shelf.
5,Just like in the old times,"These are great blocks. My two toddlers play for hours and hours. The price and quality are outstanding, we are even considering buying another set to make our collection bigger :)"
2,Stay away from this one,"Seriously, unless you have acres of kitchen counter, this thing is dangerous. It is extremely hot all around and has partially melted some cords that we unfortunately had set behind the toaster. Of course toasters can be hot, but we had many in the past and this one stands out as worrisome. My wife bought this because it looked nice with our other stainless steel kitchen equipment but this was a mistake. If you're toasting things, I hope you are not in a hurry, and not particular about even toasting- toasted here, not so toasted there. I thought Krups was a good name - this one is just poorly designed."
3,And this is how the end started............,"Scrubs season 5 continued it's rich humor that made the first four seasons so funny, but started it's nosedive towards the end of season 5 that continued on into season 6. It's a sad thing to watch, many of the characters start to wear out their welcome and start to get more annoying than funny."
4,Scrubs,Very good product. It's working fine even in a different country. It was a gift to my wife in SouthAmerica and is working ok.Thanks
3,Where's episode 8?,"Episode 8 was removed and replaced with a commentary of episode 8. Video was unchanged...just the sound. Could this not have gone on the bonus section?So, now, instead of getting to hear any of the banter, you get to hear the janitor dubbed over the entire episode mostly talking about stuff not even related to the current episode. Only 20% of the original sound is left. This was unneeded."
2,mild problems,we had problems with the thrid disk in the series we had to chaoter select evry show they would not play all the way thru .
4,Not as great as Season 4,"Relationship-wise, J.D. meets some great women but also ends up learning a lot about himself this season. He also goes through a great change while learning how to live.The music of this season is VERY good!All around, wonderful."
4,scrubs season 5,I've seen most of these shows on tv but they still make me laugh like its the first time.
2,What happened??,"I have been a huge fan of the show, and waited for the release of season 5 on DVD.Well, I have so far watched the first of three DVD's and have found this season to be almost unwatchable!!Gone is the funny banter, interesting plots and development of the characters. This season seems to be all flashback ""gags"" that take up almost half of each episode. Even worse they are all childish and not funny whatsoever.It seems like the producers and writers ran out of material, so instead of 30 mins of plot they just wrote 10 mins and filled the rest of the episodes with circus material.Save your money, and rent the season on DVD."
2,THE STORY IS ALL WRONG!,"This story is nothing like the originals. Although it takes place with the primary beloved creatures being older, we could have been spared the details of them getting sick and eventually dying. This does not keep with the original youth and magic of the first stories. There was NO NEED to show us the end of our favorite creatures lives. I think any future attempts at this series should be directed towards giving us MORE TIMELESS ADVENTURES of this group of best friends while in their prime. Never forget that the original audience for this series was intended to be children. I would not let my son read this book."
1,His other books are much better,"I bought this book because I was so very impressed with the Willows in Winter and the way Horwood carried on in the vein of Graham, but this book - well, I read it outloud to the family and we all burst out crying in the end. There was no reason whatsoever to end what has been a lifelong fantasy for some. I have to put it on the very bottom of Horwood's work."
3,Good Book,"This book is good, but not great. The first two books are excellent after that it gets kind of old. If you are a fan of the series, you can handle it."
4,Great Book!,"Forbidden Fruit by Erica Spindler was a very unique novel. It really showed how sometimes people can be too hypocritical. Hope was supposed to be so pious, but she was the worst of them all! Glory would have probably turned out better, although she didn't turn out bad, if Hope had not been so harsh. Sometimes you go too far and cause the child to want to do the very things you don't want them to do. Lily was a better person than Hope, also. I thought Santos was a great guy, and I'm glad he and Glory ended up together."
2,Forbidden read,"My overall impression of this book was that it was good. Not great, not terrible, just plain good. As an avid reader of Spindler's I must say that this long anticipated book should have been anything but. The storyline was very unreal as well as the characters. Gloria seemed to be a too annoyingly perfect: The beautiful, spoiled, rich daddy's girl who always gets what she wants. The plot was very predictable, (gee, I wonder if Gloria will get the man that she's been pining over? Hmmmm, well since she gets everything else......) and at times, the storyline grew dull and quite boring. If you want to read the book just to see what all the fuss is about, all the power to you. But don't say that I didn't warn you."
5,Great Book- I never even heard of Erica Spindler,This is an excellent book. It has you wondering the whole time what is going to happen next. It's so hard to put it down.
4,Fantastic Romantic- Suspense! 4 1/2 Stars!,"There isn't much to add, since so many reviewers have already said what I am thinking now. I absolutely loved everything about this book. The mystery had me turning the pages nonstop, I couldn't put this book down! The love story was heartfelt, and so emotional! I highly recommend this gem to any mystery OR a romance novel fans.It was worth every penny I spent."
3,"its all right, but not what i hoped for","The apostle Paul was a world traveler. He went to more places than most people of even our time go to. He saw so many things. The experiences he must have had were amazing. But this book makes them seem boring. The life of Paul was surely more exciting then this.That being said, though, this book does a great job with the epistles that Paul wrote. It provides a great deal of insight into what the apostle was probably thinking as he wrote his different letters and I find myself understanding those epistles much better than I did before.But the life of Paul was surely more exciting than this."
5,The Apostle: A Life of Paul,"When I read this account of Paul, it helped me to see who this man personally was and what he experienced in his life as he preached Christ, the risen Savior. I recommend it to anyone who might struggle with his writings in Romans."
3,It was okay. Worth the price.,"I enjoyed the book, and did learn quite a bit I didn't know before. It is obviously well researched. However, it did get a little boring in some parts. If you are looking for a good story, this probably isn't the book for you. If you are looking to learn about the life of Paul, it is a good source."
4,A man to be admired,Reading the book has given me a glimpse of Paul that makes me admire him even more. He was a SUPER Christian!
5,An awesome history!,"The Apostle: The Life of Paul is a great book! Very easy to read and so interesting. I love history, so this book has been wonderful because it puts the writings of Paul into historic perspective, tieing them with events that were happening at the time. Too often we read the Bible as a collection of ""stories"" and can't really connect them to real world events. This book does that, and explains what certain Scriptures mean in context with what the church of the day was dealing with. A really interesting read!"
3,The Apostle: The Life of Paul,Very interesting and entertaining. At times I felt like I was walking beside Paul in his travels to spread God's word. I experienced the same emotions as Paul during his successes and failures. If I were a younger person reading this story I believe I would want to enter the missionary field.
2,Disappointing,This was a unenthusiastic account of Paul's life. The extreme highs and lows that he would have been through were ignored. I found it boring and verging on insulting to Paul
2,The apostle : the life of Paul,Tried really hard to learn more about Paul but could not finish the book. in my opinion this book did not give me a historical account of Paul
3,Intriguing,This book makes you think about Paul in ways I have not considered before. That's what makes it an interesting or intriquing book.
4,File is a bit small and flimsy,"The file included is a bit small and flimsy, although cute. Seems to work OK, no other complaints--it is a good tool to have. Cost is good. Got this more for the Depth Gauge than the file. Home Depot charges over $9 just for the gauge, so this is a good deal, especially if you combine the shipping with other purchases and get free shipping.Other places have this product too, but charge for shipping."
5,Just what he wanted,Santa brought these to my husband and he's very excited to get his chain saw all set for next springs wood!
3,descent tool,"good tool for the price,looks like it will work well,have not seen both items any cheaper good buy well made for the money."
3,Hard to use,"Chainsaws are fun (real fun) to use but the teeth need sharpening a lot. After you sharpen them a few times you need to lower the little depth guide bumps - this tool does that - sort of. It's all there is at a reasonable cost so you are stuck fiddling around with it. It works, but not real good. It's cheap - that's the best feature."
3,Jerry Lee Lewis,This album is very good if you just like good lod classical rock and roll. This brings piano and rock together in a great fusion. Great.
4,THIS WHEEL RULES!!!,"The wheel is great! you can use the wheel even on your PS2, if you have one. the wheel has excellent force feed back and you can feel anything that you drive on in the game. Get it now! it is on sale! It also comes with pedals!"
5,Great,Great tool. This sure does save you a lot of money. Works great and you don't have to buy new Chains every time you use the saw
2,Measure studs spacement first!!!,"Big dissapointment! I should have read the reviews more carefully.. I bought this unit because it was recommended as accessory to the Sansumg 42"" LCD I was purchasing from Amazon....It turns out this is a very limited mount if you plan to fix it to a dry wall. You cannot slide the bars horizontally and the center of the openings are 31"" apart with a little leeway both sides... If the studs are 24"" apart, like mine, forget it. What a bummer....Amazon should place a caveat next to its recommendation as accesory."
3,Mount seems sturdy but buyer beware.,If you bought the Pioneer 6070 DO NOT BUY THIS MOUNT. It doesn't fit. The on wall bracket is roughly 30 inches wide (outside to outside) and the mounting holes on the back of the plasma are 34 inches apart. This puts the bracket outside of the rail system. I don't understand how 11% of the buyers of the Pio 6070 have bought this mount and not posted this.It's too bad this doesn't fit because it went up easy and seems to be very well made.SC
4,"""Jingle Bells . . . Santa Kills!""","As a way to get money and revenge for being fired at Dalby's Department Store, Paul ""Pres"" Nichols, his girlfriend (Diane Morris), and older brother (Danny) plan on holding the owner's daughter (Reva Dalby) for ransom--except everything that could go wrong does, like kidnapping the wrong girl: Reva's poor cousin, Pam Dalby, one of the few characters who makes a reappearance from the previous book. Almost all the other characters in here are new. Like in the first ""Silent Night,"" Reva isn't in the forefront of this sequel very much (a lot of time is spent on the kidnappers), though she is still as cruel as ever, apparently not learning her lesson from a year ago.If you liked this book, then you'll probably enjoy the other two: ""Silent Night"" and ""Silent Night 3."""
5,SHE HASN'T CHANGED A BIT!,"Reva Dalby hasn't changed at all! She still her snobby self from the last book, and even gets in a little trouble herself in theis one! :) That's the great thing about this book! I have read all Silent Night books and alot of other Fear Street books and I would HIGHLY recommend this one because you dont know whats going to happen. It really is a page-turner! THANX!"
2,dumb dumb dumb,"This book was dumb! After reading the 1st Silent Night, I thought that maybe this one would actually be interesting, but it wasn't!Do yourself a favor -----> don't read this book!*sparkle*"
5,Great for Avent Isis Users!,"This bag is great if you use or plan on using the Avent Isis pump. This bag is not only the perfect size for your diaper bag (not too big or too small) but it fits two 9 ounce Avent (wide rims) bottles, the Isis pump and accessories easily. For going on longer trips, I would suggest using two ice bags instead of just the one in comes with to keep your bottles cold. All in all, this is a very cute and versatile bottle bag! Highly recommended!"
3,This bag is so-so,"The bag did keep bottles warm for about 3 hours or so, but the bottles (we use Dr. Browns) were hard to get in & out of the bag. The bag is lined in a very thick plastic material and the bottles stick to it. We also spilled formula in it and could not clean til we got home (which was a few hours) and the bag smelled. I tried washing in hot water with Ivory dish soap and the smell just lingered. Ending up throwing is away."
5,The Amazing One in Action,A rare and totally enjoyable opportunity to see one of the masters at work.You see the Amazing one do what he does best. He absolutely charms (most important) and then amazes his audience.I am a little sad he actually tips some of the secrets and techniques...it takes away from the intrigue of not knowing.Buy this DVD and be prepared to be entertained.
5,Defining New Age from East to West,"Truly amazing composition.I listen to Trance, New Age, Ambient, Middle Eastern, and a mix of others.This CD I would say has a mix of all of the above. The usage of Piano, Flute, Dulcimer, variation of strings, and more, have been put together to define New Age Culture Music."
5,The Next Big Act from the Rock,"The Novaks knew exactly what they were doing when they recorded their self-titled debut CD. They reached back to the roots of rock n' roll and created this awesome sound. From the catchy short single ""Goodbye Rock n' Roll Band"" to the love ballad ""Don't Worry Baby"", The Novaks do not disapoint. I bought this CD from a friend of the band, and I'm glad I did. This CD was trapped in my car's CD player for a couple of weeks. That's how addicting these guys are! A lot of people wonder what ""good"" can come out of Newfoundland. As a Newfoundlander myself, I can say that a lot of awesome stuff does come out of this province. And The Novaks are on the top of the list for ""Awesome Things to have Come out of Newfoundland"". Rock on!\m/ >_< \m/"
4,Kick Ass Rock From The Rock,I'm giving it 4 stars cause some of the songs are pretty short but overall if you dig joel plaskett emergency or matt mays then this cd is right up your alley
1,Did not fit,The product did not connect to my laptop (despite the product summary saying it was compatible) due to a lack of clearance on the actual plug- in to the computer. It basically wasn't long enough to plug in to the laptop to allow for recharging.
4,Delivers as promised,"If you have never been to the WSOP and plan to play a satellite for your entry you should read through this book at least once. While the online sections can leave a little to be desired, there isn't much difference it strategy or information, I recommend this book to anyone with questions about satellite play. It will cover your basics and break down each tournment into stages so you can focus on one piece at a time."
3,Nothing new,"This is mostly a rehash of general tournament advice. If you read everything, you will want to read this, since it is good advice. But if you are pretty experienced, you probably won't learn much."
1,Useless,Don't bother spending your money on this. The five pages on satellites in Lindgren's book far outweigh any content in this...its mostly just stories of past satellites with some obvious advice thrown in (auto-checking online is a tell!!! thanks for that)
2,The Whalestoe Letters,"The Whalestoe Letters by Mark Z. Danielewski is an extension of his premier novel, House of Leaves. Initially appearing as an appendix to the novel, The Whalestoe Letters (which includes ten additional letters) are those written by Johnny Truant's mother Pelafina H. Lievre during her residence at the insane asylum. Like House of Leaves as a whole, The Whalestoe Letters is to fiction and literature what thought experiments are to physics; Danielewski seems to write and publish to push boundaries and test waters for no other reasons than curiosity. While I would argue that the experiment of House of Leaves is very interesting, his subsequent publications are less successful. The (limited) success of The Whalestoe Letters is that it makes me want to go back and read House of Leaves once again."
1,New with old,"How to make new jewels with old gold. Mark Danielewski is a very talented writer, but he should kbnow better than recycling his best-seller intot less-than best-seller. We are all following him, but not to the point of being blind-folded; To be read, but not too hurriedly."
4,Whalestoe Letters,"I love this. Not only are the original letters from House of Leaves included, but new ones are added giving better background and understanding of the House of Leaves character. A very good investment, glad it was made into a seperate book."
3,Interesting Read,I found this book to be very enlightening. I would have preferred to read this book along the same time as HOUSE of Leaves. I think that it complemented the other book so well. It is a very short read though.
2,Don't do it,"A terrible effort, meant to capitalize, I guess, on the financial success of House of Leaves. But do not buy this book. Buy House of Leaves (which is amazing), and consider the 11 lost letters here as insignificant, because they are. Hell, the original letters in House of Leaves aren't even that good. They provide a couple of additional clues about what is going on, but that's all. They're certainly not literature. In short, Danielewski should never have put his name to this travesty, but I guess he needed the money at the time?"
5,Whalestow Letters,Bought this book for my nephew for a gift. He thought it was great! Thought it was new.
4,Great addition,This book makes for a great addition to any Mark Danielewski collection. I do feel however that these letters should have been included in House of Leaves
1,These had water damage and I returned them,"The items were in a box without a top and they were damaged so I returned them, they could not have been sterile anymore."
4,Creative ideas for fixing one of American's comfort foods.,"All in all, an imaginative and creative take on preparing meatloaf. I was especially impressed as various cuisines were explored; i.e., Mediterranean, Greek, Indian, Italian, etc. There were also good pointers for using turkey and chicken as well as some good recipes for using poultry in meatloaf. So, why the four stars, and not five? Too much reliance on chili sauce and bacon strips as a topping and little or no variety of the brown gravy type of meatloaf. Also, the editors missed a ""biggie."" There is a recipe for a spinach cheese loaf, and guess what? Spinach is not listed in the ingredients and not mentioned in the preparation so readers are on their own for determining how much and what type of spinach to use. Otherwise, a good guide, and one that I will use for new meatloafs."
5,FromSardoVeterano,"I love Sarazza they have a great beat, and they trully give pride to being Italian-Sardo, and to people who are just plain Italian too. They need people in the U.S. to buy this because this is something all Italian Americans will love. by the way the last girl that wrote a review if you see this send me an e0mail to CLownjokER@aol.com Your the first Sardo-Italian girl Ive heard of here!!!!!!!!!"
1,Another useless pedigree yawner with no practicality,You have to be a devout pedigree analyst or become one for this book to be effective in the daily war handicapping horse races. In that event the book is 5 stars but outside thatit is almost useless.
3,A little disappointing,"OK, the author clearly knows her matreial, but I was really looking forward to reading this book as I am interested in horse pedigrees and their usefulness as a handicapping tool. Stich shares some good ideas, but nothing I hadn't read in other volumes on comprehensive handicapping. The ideas are solid, but the material will need constant updating to be effective. I really wish she had spent more time discussing why certain traits are passed from maternal and paternial ancestors instead of just offering a blanket statement that ""speed and surface characteristics come from the sire, while racing class comes from the dam."" I've heard it before, but nobody has been able to satisfactorily tell me why this may be the case or back it up with any evidence.As a practical tool for handicapping, I really don't think it's that useful."
3,Just okay,It's too hard for the puppy to get the treats from the middle and too easy to get them from the sides.
2,Kong Activity Ball,"I didn't like it very well. If you put a ziggy in the large hole it falls out, and the end that treats go in-not too good either. If you use the peanut butter suggested to be used with it, too big of a mess."
4,Fun,"This is the only stuffable toy my 12 week-old pup can get anything out of. Using kibble, it isn't much of a challenge and it only occupies him for a few minutes, but it is fine for the purpose. I don't stuff with peanut butter or frozen sweet potatoes, it just makes a mess and it hard to clean out, and he gives up. I bought a small squirrel buddy, he can't even get his favorite liver treats out of it, and neither can I! I will be modifying the prongs on that one."
3,Big for a small,Ordered this for an 8 week old 3 pound puppy. Thought small would be a pretty good size for her but it is actually rather large. She can't get her mouth around it and squeeze treats out. Instead she rolls it around and one or two fall out which seems to entertain her for a bit but does nothing to help with her need to chew. Surprising because I ordered other puppy kong products and in small and they are perfect size. Maybe she will grow into it but for now she just chases it around. Also the material is very stiff and not easy to bend leading me to think even if it fit her mouth shed have a hard time with it anyway. If you are looking for something for pup to chew on and release treats I wouldn't really recommend this. However as a chase it and maybe a treat will come out toy its working pretty well.
3,"Fun, some challenge, hard to clean","This Kong is fun for kibble dispensing, but it's not challenging enough that it lasts very long. We stopped using it as a frozen kong for crate time, because it's almost impossible to clean peanut butter out of it (or anything else 'squishy' for that matter). Our dog does like licking at the ridges, but it makes a mess, and again is hard to clean."
3,"KONG Puppy Activity Ball Dog Toy, Small","This was too large for my dog. It said it was for small dogs, but mine would not play with it."
3,Nice penguin rug.,"This rug is a nice size, however it's very thin and not soft at all. I use this in my bathroom. I have to hang it up for it to dry after use or else the back starts to mold. Despite all this it is durable and I haven't had any problem with pieces of the rug coming off in the wash. It's a woven rug, no rubber backing."
3,kinda boring,"the largest size was still pretty tiny. i didn't end up using them for what i had planned, or at all actually. there are so many beautiful papers to use, i ended up ordering a different kind. unfortunatly i had already opened the package, so i didn''t try to send them back"
4,Very well written book,"The book is very well done and informative. Technically, I don't think I'd call this book for the total beginner as it doesn't go into a lot of detail as to types of trees. It does briefly mention types of trees that work as bonsai, but doesn't give care sheets and the like found in some other bonsai books. The workshops are good in the book, however, it would have been better if the formatting was not so confusing. You tend to see pictures either before or after the text and that does cause some consternation. All things considered though, this is a really helpful book and one definitely worth buying."
5,The Best Bonsai Book Ever,"This is the best bonsai book I have ever read. It is packed with information and covers everything anyone would need to know to start a bonsai and maintain and train it and care for it to displaying it in your home. The photographs and instructional illustrations couldn't get any better. Everything is laid out crystal clear. If you are looking for a bonsai book, I highly recommend this one."
5,great purchase!,I purchased a book for one of my college courses and couldn't be happier with the result. I recieved exactly what I ordered. Quick shipping and a great deal!
5,Best EFW ever,This album can out just as EFW were at the musical best. Great songs and the band kicks ass. Thanks
5,Excellence,"Earth, Wind & Fire brings everything they're about into the synthy pop realm of the Post-Disco 80's with Raise! They'll always be the amazing Music-light Machine regardless of their tools and members. It's the soul that transcends."
5,Finally!,"Raise!, featuring Let's Groove, I""ve Had Enough, My Love and more, was one of Earth, Wind & Fire's last great albums. But the best version of Let's Groove, the 12"" LP Single version, was not available on CD for a long, long time. I searched high and low, even looking for it on an import CD, but couldn't find it...until now. This CD has that same version. Finally!!"
4,Waited a long time for this music on CD.,I waited a long time for someone to release this music to CD. I hope this record company will release the second volume (his 3rd and 4th album for Capitol records).
2,STEREO!!!,"First, the first four Beatle albums on CD, then the Rolling Stones London Years Collection. Now this. Have all the engineers forgotten how to put those masters in STEREO?!? Although it is great that these McCallum albums have made it to CD, THEY'RE IN MONO!!! It's a terrible waste, too, since the separation on the original Capitol LP's was magnificent. Yes, the songs on the McCallum CD's are dated, but his renditions would have been as fresh as ever had they been mixed in their original stereo form. Not sure? Listen to the old stereo LP's in your headphones, then this CD. I'd take the crackle of stereo vinyl any day over a mono CD."
1,Can't review what you never received!!!,"I ordered this cd, never received it, never got my money back for the purchase and was generally ignored by the provider. Very disappointing, would like to keep other from experiencing this shoddy service."
4,Pooh Read Along,My two year old son absolutely loves this item. He sits at his little table and sings along with the entire CD and turns the pages of the book right along with the music. It truly holds his attention. I highly recommend it to anyone with a toddler. They will love it!!
1,poorly made,I had to tighten this faucet from the outside and while tightening it the body on the valve twisted and it would not work! Poor material. (and it was past my 30day return period!)
4,transitional beauty,"there are some shining moments on this album that easily stand up next to dylan's best work.you can sense a transition taking place in the unbalanced material as he learns the alchemy of expressing his powerful new vision. when the marriage works, as it does on ""groom"" ""summertime"" and ""grain of sand"" it is magic. at this point more than ever dylan seems to be creating the music for himself, as a means to an end rather than an end in itself."
5,Every Grain of Sand,The best Dylan track I've ever heard closes this album-EveryGrain of Sand. He hits it right out of the ball park with beautiful lyrics and melody. Some other great uptempo tunes onthe record are Shot of Love and Heart of Mine. A very underrated record that I've enjoyed quietly for years.
4,It's what it makes you think of.,"Listening to this album makes me think of what an all-star album of cover-tunes would be like. Imagine this: a duet by Willie Nelson and Emmylou Harris on Dylan's ""Heart of Mine;"" Dylan covering Hendrix's ""The Wind Cries Mary;"" Bob Marley on Dylan's ""In the Summertime;""As far as covering Dylan's ""Every Grain of Sand"" (which must be a high-point in Christian poetry), don't bother. Just listen to the cut on this CD and the alt. version on the ""Bootleg V. 1-3"" and that should do it.One more suggestion for the ""Cover This"" album? OK, how about Aretha Franklin doing ""Shot of Love""?Oh well, it's the thought that counts."
5,Shot of Love by Bob Dylan,"Songs that are heart felt, from an artist and a storyteller who is down to earth and simplistic in his approach to getting the message across about the reality of his faith, and how he holds to it. Great music and lyrics from one of the absolute best."
4,"Hey, this album is FUN.","Scorchin'. Try and figure how they got it to sound like that. Good on ya, Bumps Blackwell."
5,"Dreams don't shatter, just end up being rerouted","I've been reading Lurlene McDaniel since I was eleven years old. Now, at 23, I can appreciate her work even more as I get older. This novel was really good. I have family members with diabetes, so I really sympathized with the main character, Rachel. Rachel learns that dreams don't always shatter, but sometimes they need to take a different route."
2,Just dry ol' steakbone.....not much else,"This is one of Fred's last recordings, just a few years before he passed. Unfortunately the sleeve notes tout this recording as being unique and impressive in it's presentation, but sadly it really just reflects how a very, old and tired man sounds after so many years. This is solo McDowell on electric. Any of Fred's previous recordings are better than this endeavor. True to marketings glory, the hype far surpasses the reality. Be wary of Amazon's used cd's from second sources. This one came heavily scratched, dirty, and with a broken cd case."
3,Looks nice..,"Orion SpaceProbe 3 Altazimuth Reflector Telescope looks nice but you can only see the moon,because the stars are not that clear my son was exited but after he spent an hour with it he is done its sitting in our dinning room corner and he never want to see moon. its very basic Telescope with the big body."
1,Sent it back,"This was a Chrismas gift, 2010. My daughter was so excited and then came the disappointment. It was impossible to get a view of anything. Any slight movement near the telescope would risk losing the view that took forever to find! My daughter wanted either a telescope or the three seasons of Avatar the Last Airbender. So once I sent this back, I bought the 3 DVD box sets and she's happier now!"
2,This IS a Rehash of the CMMI v 1.1 document,As the lead in implementing CMMI within my organization I was very disappointed in the contents of this book. It is simply a rehash of the information in the CMMI-SE/SW/IPPD/SS V1.1 that is available for FREE on the CMMI website. I found no wisdom from the authors on how to actually implement the processes and be successful with an assessment. The included CD simply includes the incomplete tables and checklists that are included as appendices (and make up about half of the book by the way). My recommendation is to save you money and read the CMMI documents.
4,simple statistical methods,"This book might have been written in part out of dissatifaction with existing texts on CMMI. Those might have been perceived by some of their readers as lacking sufficient practical details about implementation.As CMMI has gained more traction, and experience was developed in it by Kulpa and Johnson, they have shared this here. Some sections are a little elementary. Like the chapter on statistical process control. Its level of detail is suggested by how basic techniques like a histogram or scatterplot are explained. Statisticians may cringe at the simple tone. But the book is directed towards a broader audience of managers and engineers."
2,Second continuation of previous review,"""Misery'n"" is also available on JANIS 3-CD digitally remastered and without 80s instruments!"
2,Not what I expected,"Although Wilson is an incredible writer. I personally enjoy his novels, because not many people are able to capture true human essence in it's raw state and not lose it's potency on paper. He also teaches life lessons in very discreet, but practical ways. However, I was disappointed with the characters in this book. After reading A Summer's Place, I was left with the impression his other novels would blatantly express the consequences and woes of man, but I didn't expect their actions to be so detailed in this novel. What I'm saying is that if you are married and live a morally clean life and expect fairly ""clean"" reading then beware of the promiscousness in this book (not much but it can be unnerving). I would like to note that his characters always pay or are punished in some form for their course and decisions in life. However, this was just a little too worldly from my point of view."
3,Not what I was expecting,"Some good chapters, some tought to follow. Author ranges far off topic of consumption and society at times."
4,Samsonite Deluxe 3 Slat Folding Chair w/Waterfall Seat,"A good looking, sturdy and practical chair which adds seating in a stylish manner. This chair is narrow enough to allow for extra seating at a dining room table without compromising comfort. It is extremely well priced for a product of this quality and is manufactured by a well reputed company (Samsonite) which stands behind it's products.The styling of this chair is modern yet it blends into any decor. It is not too heavy to handle and stores easily due to its convenient shape.The coloring of this item are neutral as well. The sterling frame and black seat melt into the background and seem to disappear.My overall rating is a 4 and 1/2 out of 5 stars. A truly excellent product and a superb purchase."
4,Collection of Reflective Songs,"This CD is a great collection because all the songs fit together to create one mood. These songs show how well Horowitz plays the more reflective and relaxing pieces. I would give it five stars, except I was disappointed to find the live pieces have a constant coughing in the background. It's not too noticable unless you are listening for it or using headphones. It's still a very worthwhile CD if you don't already have a Horowitz collection."
1,Read before you buy!,"If you buy this changing pad you might as well throw away the wipes container because it is a piece of junk! It doesn't seal and so it dries out the wipes before you can use them. I do however like the ""Microban"" protection."
1,Waste,"This is a waste of money. For only a few dollars more, you can get a changing pad that has spaces for lotions, powder, wipes and a few diapers."
4,"Good chain, but limited information of which saws can use it","I got it brand new in the box. I would have rated it higher if it listed my model chain saw as one that it fits, so I had to do a lot of research to figure out that it's the chain for my Craftsman 50 cc 20"" chain saw (Model 358.350980). Cuts great."
3,Good for cutting firewood only,"I had hard time with cutting trees down. However, for cutting fire wood it's really good, and you can see chunks of wood flying."
1,"Does not fit my 20"" poulan","They don't fit my 20"" poulan pro chainsaw.The rail sliders on the inside of chain do not fit this saw!"
2,The Iron Ring,Tamar is a fourteen year old who is trying to figure out how he got an iron ring and what is in store for him on his journeys. Tamar lives in India and he is going through the forest. He is trying to find the king. The king was playing a game with him the night before he got the ring. Tamar meets at least five people in the whole story. He finds out the King lost his iron ring at Tamar's house. Tamar goes back home and wonders how the ring was left there when it was on the king's finger.I did not like the story and I do not usually like adventure stories. The genre was adventure and fiction. I did not relate to the story or the character.
1,Zzzzz....,"I read this book three years ago, and it still inspires an intense desire to throw it out a window. I found most of the characters to be extremely boring and/or too strange to be likable, such as the umbrella issue. Tamar's mentor spent what seemed to me to be a ridiculous amount of time talking about his umbrella. I did not care about his umbrella. I cared about the plot and the characters, and the amount of trivial dialouge included in the book bored me beyond compare. I suggest sticking to Lloyd Alexander's other books and skipping 'The Iron Ring.'"
3,Interesting yet lacking something,"While I enjoyed The Iron Ring I didn't think it was as good as other books by Lloyd Alexander. It is definitely interesting and spell binding, yet it seems to lack the usual flare of Alexander's other books. One of my favorite aspects of the book was how it really made a person think about certain issues, such as chivalry and honor."
5,The Iron Ring,"This book is great I am 11 years old I loved. Lloyd, I read Time cat, The book of Three and The Iron Ring out of them all this was the second best and then 1st was The Book of Three.The book is about Tamar who thinks a gambling game was a dream but he still has an Iron Ring on his finger so on his journey to find out the answer he meets the love of his life and life long friends."
3,A bit abstract,This book does not really say much about the major events of the revolution but rather describes the intellectual and political forces that cause the rebellion against Britian. The author gives alot of analysis on the factions present in the induvidual colonies. As a result the book seems to jump around alot and it is hard to tie things together. I expected a book about the revolutionary war which was never really discussed at all. The author shows alot of thought but does not really tell the story of what happened. This book would be a good reference for writing a college paper.
1,Author Doesn't Know What It Feels Like To Be Shy,"The author does not appear to have any experience being shy himself and moves back and forth between claiming that shy people are narcissists and saying that being shy is not their fault. I am painfully shy, however, I have never thought that I am better than someone else/more interesting than someone else and so won't speak to them. The reality is, rather, the opposite. I know I don't have a thing to say. When I try to have a conversation with someone, my mind goes blank. On page 45, the author says, "" I have found for the most part, they (shy people) don't believe they are unworthy of being talked to, but they do complain that others don't realize how interesting and wonderful they are. "" Save yourself the trouble of reading this book, written from the perspective of someone who looks at shy people like we are a science experiment. Read Goodbye to Shy by Leila Lowndes, instead, who has experience being shy, herself."
2,"BORING, LONG-WINDED, AND A WASTE OF TIME","Are you looking for a book that you can sit down with for three weeks and try to get through just to learn what you could have learned from any other book on the same subject? This is the book for you! Boring and SO long-winded. It doesn't tell you anything more than any other book on shyness. I would not recommend this book as a self-help book on shyness. I would, however, whole-heartedly recommend this for anyone suffering from insomnia."
5,carducci's approach is empowering,"I studied five popular books on shyness in the past few months, and I like Carducci's because his approach is based on intimate, detailed knowledge of shy people, as well as on his involvement with a Shyness clinic. Other books approached shyness from the point of view of theory (e.g. cognitiv/behavioral or psychodynamic) and missed the many methods of managing shyness that come directly from knowing shy people well. Two things I found overwhelmingly strong: 1) he works from a strengths perspective, looking at shyness not as a deficit, but as a personality trait whose inhibiting effect can be greatly reduced with dedicated individual effort, and 2) he has a method which is clear, goes step-by-step without the need for professional guidance, and is extremely easy to follow. It does take work....but you can get to ""the successfully shy life."""
1,Not at all helpful...,"I had to stop reading this after the first chapter or two. It has a real ""blame the victim"" tone to it, and basically asserts that shy people are selfish, and think themselves all-important. On the contrary, most shy people have huge problems with self-confidence around others, and yet are some of the most generous people around. Don't buy this book if you're shy and are tired of being talked-down to and patronized by somebody who DOES NOT understand shy people and what they experience in life. I'm very shy, and have enough self-respect to put this book back on the shelf."
2,Not Helpful,"My conclusion is that the author of this book is extroverted. While he understands shyness, he does not have a comforting voice in this book.While I am in the middle of my self-discovery and changing of my shy habits, the tone of this book only made me feel more unnatural and ""wrong"" so I put it down immediately."
1,"Bland, dry and tasteless",These doughnuts were dry and tasteless. They had very little creme filling. After eating half of one I threw the rest into the garbage.
3,Not correct format for usage,"I can not usre it I thought it was going to be a dvd, so yes I am disappointed but not sure what to do, can you help?"
1,Where's my order?,"I have never received this product and every day it shows USPS picked it up on the date of that day. Apparently there is no other way to report this kind of problem within the Amazon website, since my search of ""Complaints"" yielded no relevant content. I ordered this book back in mid-January. It was supposed to ship by Jan 23 with an expected delivery of Jan 28. Needless to say this book is effectively worthless and I question its continuing existence."
3,I bought a piano for this????!!!,"First of all let me preface my review by saying that I loved the author's first work. Loved it. However, this is not the author's first work. I don't know what Sergei was smoking, or who he was smoking it with, but it fried the parts of his brain responsible for plot and character development. First of all he spends way too much time with f sharp. I mean it's constantly f this or f that and always sharp, never flat or just plain f. Too many freakin' f's. I can say one good thing about the 'Complete Piano Sonats'. It did get me away from the computer. Unfortunately it didn't create anywhere near the stir amongst the ladies that was promised in the infomercial.In conclusion: buy this only if you enjoy playing music on the piano more than I do."
5,Good chainsaw file,"This 5/32"" chainsaw file works great on my Poulan 18"" electric chainsaw. Just make sure that you're getting the right size. It should be indicated somewhere in the owner's manual."
2,Reconsider this Book,"I couldn't finish it. I am a great fan of Lisa Plumley's and have read and enjoyed several of her other books. This was not one of them. I tried reading it, I read over half of it and never ""got it"".I was expecting a fun, lighthearted romance involving a woman and her ex-boyfriend discovering each other again in the great outdoors. That is not what I found.Ultimately, I liked Riley and his niece, but had very little interest in Jayne. I found her shallow and her obsession with blue as a ""signature color"" was a little ridiculous. Are there women that actually do that?I enjoyed Riley's niece and was far more interested in her and her relationship with her mother and boyfriend than what was going on between Riley and Jayne."
2,Not So Great Toy,"My father bought this toy for my son as an Easter gift when he was 8 months old, and the only thing he liked was the teethable car keys. I think this toy was actually ment for a much younger baby, and not an 8 month old.I now have a 7 week old baby who might find the toys to be more fun, since I put them away when my first ds was 12 months old. Although, since I have gotten them back out, my now 19 month old still wants the keys, even though I think he's too old for them, and he still has his plastic keys that aren't really made for teething.I'll probably write another review on this toy when I see if my youngest son likes the toys or not."
3,1 out of 3 ain't bad,"My 4 month old daughter really enjoys the two headed squeaky bird, but doesn't care that much about the keys or the bear. Maybe she'll grow into them? The bird washes up nicely in the washer, even after sevaral washes."
3,Silly Mommy,"I was so excited to get these teethers for my baby. I opened up the package, washed the teethers in warm soapy water, and put them in my bottle sterilizer. Silly me! They came out melted and all stuck together. I've ordered another set, and will stick to soap and water next time!"
1,Earjam Ipod earbud enhancer issue,"The earbud enhancers are too large for the earbuds on my Ipod Razor.I was very disappointed. However, they will work just fine if you are willing to adapt them by glueing them with some cement adhesive to the earbuds. Sound quality is great."
1,Avoid at all costs! The company is out of business!,Company stated they are out of business after waiting for a month. Not hard to see why they didn't survive.
3,Sounds great but does not fit on earbuds of new 80GB iPod,"The sounds is great but does not fit on earbuds of new 80GB iPod. They must have made the new earbuds a bit smaller for the 80GB iPod. The enhancers would not snap on and kept falling off. Sounded great for the little while they stayed on, though."
2,Not worth it even if cheap,This book is not well organized and the practice problems have no explanations. Go for Schneider instead.
5,Trendline 8150 Phone,"Good Sturdy, Stable Phone for Kitchen or Bedroom. Volume adjustment while talking a nice feature."
4,good phones,"Not too many of this old style around, but after doing some research I found that this company makes the best ones. Not really the color that I expected, ""ash"" in my mind is kind of gray but this is more of a medium brown, nothing like the photo on Amazon or the companies website. Don't like the volume dial on the back of the handset (looks strange) but the phone feels like quality and the sound is clear. These phones may be old school but they still have much better sound quality than cordless phones. Might buy another one to replace one of my cordless models that is having some issues. Just wish they had a plain old white or off white phone. We lose power often in the winter and these corded models still work during the outages. Took a star off for the funky color."
5,A TRUTHFULL review from someone who actually read this book!,"This book is an excellent portrayal of good form and composition. Good Poetry is hard to find and this is a book FULL of good poetry, flowing, deep, soulfull. The consistancy of emotion.....I look forward to more by this Author."
5,Looks good.,"I wanted to study the gospels as they were in harmony with each book, without buying the Chronological Study Bible."
5,Excellent!,"This is my first purchase With Amazon...and everything was excellent! From the product itself (tops condition!), super affordable price to the shipping...everything was excellent! I thought I would wait for a few weeks but I received it just a week after or even less! Thanks to Amazon! I'm enjoying the very good book. It would have cost me triple the price had i not considered my friends' recommendation to get it from Amazon! Pat Calinisan a.k.a. 'matapat' from Sydney"
1,RIDICULOUS!,The cover of the book is upside down and backward! and the entire book is a complete misprint! There are either missing words or the entire margin is off!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,The best darn book for begginers and pros !!!,"Helped me configure Windows 95 the way it should be done. It dug me out of a hole numerous times!! IT's like everything you always wanted to know about ""***"" but were afraid to ask!! I recommend this book to everyone who uses Windows 95!! YOU CAN'T GO WRONG WITH THIS BOOK!!!!!"
5,works great.,"I'm just an amateur, so don't know what I might be missing with much more expensive filters, but I use this all the time on my e-p1... pretty much anytime I am shooting outdoors. It particularly make shots with sky & clouds much more dramatic."
4,A very useful book,"for most parents. It goes into the why and the how of house rules, consequences, and follow through; very important. The use of natural and logical consequences is explained too. Gives specific examples of misbehaviors and different ways to deal with each. Ways that will TEACH the children why rules are fair or important. Ways that will reinforce your expectations when they decide to test your rules without having to resort to the sad, ""Because I Said So."" Children sometimes need to be reminded who is in control but the parent needn't be a dictator. If you want to teach your children, this is a good resource. If you like to tell your kids what to do, you probably wouldn't like this book."
5,Very Funny n Gives Great Ideas for Consequences,"I love this book. It gives you great ideas of consequences for kids according to what age they are. Some of the consequences make me laugh and I could see how they will be affective. I have been to parenting classes and have read through a lot of parenting material but this has been favorite so far and the most affective. I have seen a lot of changes with my two girls and I (7 yr, and 12yr old) since I have implemented some of the stuff in this book. It would make a great present for parents. I am going to buy all my sisters one."
1,FASCILE AND UNENGAGING,"By what sort of literary standards are we navigating when books such as Deer Table Legs win prizes? There is ample evidence of loose language, awkward diction, and sub-par poetic ability in Zandvakili's first book that we (the reading public) hope she does not abuse us with a second. Not recommended at all."
1,no beauty here!,I have read and re-read this book several times and I cannot find the beauty others seem to have discovered. The work represented in Deer Table Legs is not poetry at all. Where's the use of deep metaphor? The hightened sense of language? Basic common sense? I am not convinced with the author's use of the child-like perspective. Her voice and imagination remain at the infantile level and have no other value than spouting gibberish thought patterns. This book is a great disappointment and not worth the time and money I spent on it.
5,"Wildy imaginative, outrageously wonderful","I do not usually read poetry. If I do, it is classical Persian. When I got a copy of ""Deer Table Legs"" I was reluctant to even open it, fearing I would put it down after the first two sentences. I was wrong. I was struck by Zandvakili's wildly imaginative style. The twists and turns are often unexpected and seeminly disconnected. But each poem as a whole makes absolute sense, in some strange and wonderful way. Brilliant! Jahanshah Javid"
2,A Sundry Aglomeration of Images,"What passes for poetry today is taxing to the true spirit of the tradition. Deer Table Legs and the poems therein are the perfect example of what Harold Bloom warns us about in his essay in The Best of the Best American Poetry: ""the barbarians are about us and we must retain the heights."" No music in the lines, inattention to traditional meters, lack of vision, and ill-afforded ennui are the faults found in this book. We must demand higher standards if poetry is to survive into the next century."
3,helped,"It's OK for a kid, specially at home...as I did not know how to play violin so this one helped.Teacher said it's only good for 6-9 weeks."
4,Prompt service,"Thank you for the prompt service with this order. The bow right was requested by my daugter's violin teacher, and we were able to get it quickly and for a reasonable price. I do appreciate the great customer service, especially in this day and age when business has become so impersonal. Thanks again!"
1,"No excuse to not adjust errors in pricing, years later.","Both this book and the ""blue"" book mislead readers by listing ""price values"" that are blatently low,-on the very uncommon items listed, even though the pricing errors were brought to both author's attention years ago. Many revisions later, they remain for the most part unchanged.Shame on them."
4,Thorough & Fun,"I'm a ""know it all"" and have dabbled in many of the systems covered in this book, so I wasn't expecting much. Boy was I surprised! Not only is it reader friendly with worksheets and quizes but the author clearly knows her stuff and is able to describe each orientation clearly and succintly. I found this very helpful in developing insight (and compassion) into myself and friends and family. Most helpful!"
5,An unique and essential guide towards a better understanding,"How lucky was I to get my hands on this book! I get very frustrated with my relationship with my girlfriend, parents, etc. and I found the knowledge in this book to be profoundly helpful in understanding my relationships. A really, really interesting and useful read."
2,The ultimate guide to a wide variety of nonsense,"Anything that inspires some self-analysis and communication with those close to us about who we are and what's important to us has some value. Your fortune cookie, for instance, may offer real insight if you and your dinner partner discuss it long enough.But nearly all the ""systems of typology"" described in this book are, to put it kindly, unscientific (I'll allow that birth order has some legitimate predictive value). But numerology, astrology, palm-reading (and yes, Meyers-Briggs)?If for some reason you are a true believer in one of the above, I mean no offense and am not out to convince you otherwise. But if you hold to a system based on, well, rational thought, this book is for entertainment purposes only."
2,Bulb failed,"Ideally a tool should last longer than one day if not abused. This was not the case with this light. During my time using it, it worked great albeit not as bright as I would have liked. It shines brightest straight and radially, which is a great combination. However, the light bulb had died later in the day, rendering it unusable. I noticed another retailer sells replacements for the bulb assembly. In summary, I wish I had purchased the LED version which takes 3 AAA's over this light and costs approx 25% more. The LED would have solved both issues - It would have been brighter and the bulb is far less likely to fail."
3,Handy but overpriced,"Two days after I ordered this I found it for half the price at local hardware discount store. It's lack of a switch -- twist bottom to turn on/off -- is a bit cheapo for $12.It works, though. I taped it to a hollowing tool so I can see inside a vessel on my lathe while I work."
5,L-functions and Eisenstein Series,"This is a fantastic book written by one of the leaders in the field. Aimed at advanced graduate students and researchers, it leads them very quickly, and with a remarkable economy of means, to exciting topic at the forefront of the subject, some of which were developped by the author himself and are presented in book form for the first time. The material developped in this book provides fertile ground for new research. Highly recommended!"
4,Promoting a reclaiming environment.,"This book is wonderful in guiding teachers and administrators in developing an atmosphere that promotes the positive development of all children. After a large section devoted to describing the wrong-doings of Americans and the decay of our value system (at times a little extreme,) the latter part of the book gives great strategies for the development of positive classroom management and a ""reclaiming environment."" Worth a read."
5,A powerful tool for parents and educators who want to go the extra mile,"The best minds of the future can be lost to the pressures of life. ""Reclaiming Youth at Risk: Our Hope for the Future"" is a guide to help parents and educators reach out to children and help them overcome their problems and stay on track for a better life. Blending traditional native American wisdom with proven philosophy, ""Reclaiming Youth at Risk"" is a powerful tool for parents and educators who want to go the extra mile."
5,Cool album!,"Canada's Loverboy put out their second album in 1981,contractually,after the success of their self-titled debut the previous year. There are some hard-rockers on this album such as WORKING FOR THE WEEKEND and WHEN IT'S OVER. These guys are one of the best new wave bands of all-time. Loverboy fans are also fans of Blondie and The Cars. The other songs are good. These guys love having Billy Joel,Bruce Springsteen and Barbra Streisand as their Columbia Records labelmates. The aforementioned artists were under contract with the label in 1981 also."
1,Look at the Album Cover!!!!,That should be a clue NOT to buy this! It's that lame lead singer in his red leathers.You'd be better off to buy a pack of cigarettes instead...I've been hearing good things about them!
2,Typical '80's Rock,"It's not necessarily the best album, although there are a couple of hits you can probably still hear on retro '80's format stations 'Working For The Weekend' and 'When It's Over'. I thought that these were the best songs on the album. I probably should have gone with one of the greatest hits albums because there are more listenable songs on those."
3,Loverboy got lucky on this one,"If you are desperate to own a Loverboy album, then you probably want to buy this one.This was the last of this bands success [and only real success], so enjoy it while it lasts. As one of their songs says, they were the LUCKY ONES.And another song points out well, this one TOOK THEM TO THE TOP.But they fell fast after that.The got EMOTIONAL too.WATCH OUT, because IT'S YOUR LIFE. JUMP.Were they WORKING FOR THE WEEKEND when they wrote that song? Well, they are probably working weekdays now flipping hamburgers, but who knows...The GANGS IN THE STREET took over music a little later with Rap, which these guys could never do.And, WHEN IT""S OVER they only left us with this one short album to remember them by.Listen if you must, I rate this one a so-so recording for those bored and wanting to waste some time.Three stars is the best I can do. Lucky they got that..."
1,Blah,"Never liked this band. With the exception of Working For The Weekend, everything was was boring generic pop-rock.If you're going to buy a non-hits collection, this is probably their best, but if you live your life without this album, you won't be missing anything."
4,You can't deny that these guys were good.,"This is the sort of purchase I make when I look at the stacks of vinyl records I have and rediscover an old favorite. Even though Loverboy rode the MTV express to a more prominent place in music history, it is hard to deny that they were a good band.Grab a copy and party on down. Or crank it up and aggravate your neighbors, whichever comes first."
5,get lucky,"Loverboy's Get Lucky is an excellent follow up to their debut album from the previous year. One of Loverboy's best known songs kicks things off, Working for the Weekend. You always know what's coming when you hear the cowbell! Other highlights include: When It's Over, Jump, Lucky Ones, and Take Me to the Top. Anyone who enjoyed Loverboy's first album will enjoy the follow up as well."
2,"If you're here, you're already too far gone...","Well here's another one of those cookie-cutter '80s rock bands - music run through the corporate blender and served up with a wink and cynical smile. You'll probably see these guys on VH-1's ""Where Are They Now"", painting signs or rebuilding motorcycle engines. This band just goes to show that people can be nostalgic about anything. If it's your bag, then enjoy. But let's not make a habit of it."
2,What a letdown!,If you're reading this you probably already agree that the subject matter is fascinating. Unfortunately this book earned its stars from me for subject matter alone. The writing is horrible. The information is sketchy. The ONLY reason to buy this book is that it is the only Gainsbourg bio in English.
1,I love you...Neither do I,"Man,Alan Clayson really dislikes Serge Gainsbourg,I never read a book where an author puts his subject so low,what's worst he does it in a style that's so hard to follow it's almost a dare to finish this book,(makes one wonder if it's written in english),he had a lot of mistakes also,and he doesn't interviewed nobody close to Gainsbourg in real life,it seems all this books offers comes from his resaerchs and personal opinions,what's odd if why he wrote the book if he feels so bad about him.A bad book poorly written."
1,Appalling,"Riddled with factual and chronological errors, unsympathetic to the point of being uninterested in its subject, and written in a highly irritating, self-satisfied voice, Clayson's book is really little more than just strings of tedious rock critic cliches macramed together on the pretense of being a biography. A fascinating, talented and complex man, Gainsbourg deserves better treatment than this."
5,Great,"this litter is great. i have a cat and a ferret so i'm constantly battling litter odor. i just switched from fresh step cat litter because i was unhappy with the way it formed the clumps. before, when i would empty the litter boxes, the clumps were wet and extremely sticky and all around nasty. with this litter, the clumps are dry, not sticky, and very easy to remove. i use the tidy cats power blend and mix it with baking soda so my pet odors are virtually eliminated. great product!"
1,AWFUL DOES NOT LOCK IN ODOR!!!,"My kitty was separated from his mom at an early age. He does not know how to cover his ""stuff"" so it smells really bad. I saw this and thought it was different and it says ""locks in odor"" and its more expensive than regular litter. WASTE OF MONEY. DOES NOT DO ANYTHING. And when he pee's this does not clump so I have to change it more often. DO NOT BUY THIS!!!"
1,Excuse me,"Excuse me ! Sadly I am required to give it a star because if it were up to me it would have none.But to the point. I have almost lost trust in the library system. Aren't they supposed to screen books for its readers? My sister borrowed it and started to read it. She stopped after a few pages , not even finishing the first chapter because of the language. Then my father looked through it and found an area with explicit descriptions of things a 13 year old ,or anyone for that matter, should be reading about! I don't recommend this book to any person."
4,A cruel and challenging world,"I would not have enjoyed this book when I started reading science fiction in my early teens. I didn't want to read about a harsh, unfair society with unfathomable rules and awful consequences back then-- I already had junior high school to cope with, thank you.Overall, it is a powerful story of a resourceful girl who conquers adversity, grows up and achieves her goals-- making a fair number of mistakes along the way. Although this book has many moments of surreality, multiple themes and plots are successfully woven together by the end. It contains my favorite nutshell description of undesirable college roommates, made hilarious by being transplanted into a magical world. And it finally explained for me the relationship between sexuality and magic. (Duh.) This is a book that will stay with you. Swanwick is a terrific writer for mature readers."
3,Very dark...,"I'm not sure how old I was when I read this for the first time, but after re-reading it, I am certain that I was too young. I do remember really liking it, and now, I am not sure that I even understood it that first time around to even say that I really liked it! There was so much sex, violence and profanity, making this a very adult and very dark fantasy novel. And in re-reading it, the only thing that I distinctly remembered was when Jane got her first period.Overall, reading it this time around, I did find it to be fascinating, but I have to admit that I just didn't love it. It was certainly original, but it was just a bit too dark for me, really. And since I bought the sequel, I have to say, that I am not actually dying to read it...."
2,an acid trip without the pleasure of acid,"Swanwick was going (i think) for a deeply intellectual trip through a strange and exciting world of magic and technology. he missed. there are rules people follow in books and they follow them because they make the books interesting. and unless one is a very good author, breaking the rules makes for a boring book. and the end was ridiculous. it was like the end of Congo. ""well, i wrote 400 pages, guess i better call it quits. hmm, lets see. wait i got it. she'll wake up and it will all have been a dream."" if it had a decent ending it might have been ok. but i guess he thought he was being clever."
2,"almost, but not quite","Swanwick stretches...leaps...and crashes in smoldering inferno that no one remembers. Well, the book TRIES to go somewhere. It builds up a beautiful fantasy world, dark and eerie with a twist of the magical. And in this world...nothing earthshaking happens. The focus dissolves, the point is lost, and the reader is left bewildered and adrift.Was there a deadline to be met or did the author get bored? Questions we will never ask..."
5,I loved this book!!! But it is not for kids!,"I aquired this book by accident, and started reading it- Wow! It is dark, complex, ispired, and rough. It is not a book for kids, and I get the feeling that somehow it ws promoted that way, thus all the negative reviews below FrOM KIDS! it does not deserve the low star rating it has. If you are looking for an engrossing, bizarre, imaginative, fast pacedand fun sci-fi escapist read, check this out."
5,"Dark and twisted, yet beautiful.","Swanwick creates the most believable female character I've ever read. A very wonderful character. Not your stereotypical heroine, virtuous and perfect, but strong, vulnerable, confused... just a human being. The world he creates is great. Almost like are own, but not quite. Elves are the upperclass, trolls are middle management, and dwarves are are pretty low on the totem pole. It has a dream-like quality (like his other books). Just when you think you understand the logic of this world he adds something else that throws things off kilter. Keeps you on your toes. The attention to detail creates a wonderfully textured story"
2,Misleading...,"Don't be fooled by the title or cover of this book with its tender picture of a vigilant and protective dragon guarding a sleeping girl. The story contains nothing of the sort. The dragon is cold, selfish and often silent, who cruelly manipulates both the girl and others for his own ends without concern for their well being. The synopsis above is incorrect, too. Humans do /not/ pilot the dragon machines. Only human/elf halfbreeds raised to be soldiers are allowed that. Violence, obscenity and sex"
4,"This type of story doesn't come along every day, you know.","My goodness, but this was bizarre. It was, however, very well written. Once you got the hang of trying to follow what was going on, it really became a fun book to read. This is not the type of book that you can read quickly. I normally finish a 350 page book in about 4 hours. This book took me about 2 weeks to read, as I kept having to go back through it to make sure I understood what was going on. Even though I had to do that, I really enjoyed the book, as I'd never read anything like this before. I recommend this book only to readers who really take their reading seriously, otherwise you might not be able to finish the book."
4,Good piano (keyboard),"I recently bought this keyboard because I have a piano class, so I need a large piano. This instrument has keyboards that looks like piano. It has many type of sounds and it is cheap as well."
3,"Good, but stopped working","We'be had this product for just over two years, and now it stopped working. We have really enjoyed this product during this period, but we are disappointed it broke after only two years."
2,No details,"An improvement over the first edition but not a serious reference book for collectors. It is a decent book for entry level collectors that are not interested in historical or technical details. While many authors choose to focus on one model, this looks more like a catalog. Broad but lacking in depth."
3,Browning sporting arms of distinction 1903 - 1992,Excellent book for the collector of Browning sporting arms but I lack a deeper technical insight.
3,Out of stock everywhere,This dvd is part of a 11 disc set.This is volume 2 and can not be found anywhere.I have the whole chaotic centure set besides this.I don't know why no one is selling it used. I need this dvd because I don't know what happensI am disapointed taht amazon canceled my order because it was out of stock. I can't find this anywhere and would pay at least $30 for this alone.
4,A straightforward guide to what you CAN control,"There are so many people who say there is nothing you can do, but after reading this book I feel there is some hope. Contains many suggestions, and gives several areas and methods of modification. Didn't suit my personal needs for the present, because I have a breastfed baby w/ the condition, but will work for us in the future I'm sure."
5,Just Say OM is perfect for teens!,"I use this book to teach yoga to teenagers. I love it, the meditations are accessible, the writing is really teen friendly and it just hits the spot! I highly recommend this book for any teen interested in yoga, it's very clear and easy to understand, a must for anyone beginning their yogic path!"
2,NOT the Original Sound Tracks,"->!!! Not O.S.T. Not O.S.T. Not O.S.T. !!!These CDs are NOT O.S.T.(Original Sound Track).As stated in plain sight on the back of the CD case, the music is performed by Fantasia.The title at the top of the page should not have ""O.S.T."" but instead ""Fantasia"".The Editorial Reviews - Album Description should state this so people know what type of music this is BEFORE buying!"
2,A Missed Opportunity,"First of all, I want to make it clear that my rating expresses my dissatisfaction with the quality of the DVD and not the movie itself, which is actually quite good. The transfer, while enhanced for 16x9, looks like a straight videotape or laserdisc transfer and not a remastering from original sources. The sound is a complete disaster. I suspect a lot of people will be buying this for the Mike Oldfield soundtrack, which contains some music not available anywhere else. It is pitifully reproduced here in low-fi sound quality that does justice to neither the film nor the composer.For a real ""out of this world"" film experience of the US Space Program, I heartily recommend Al Reinert's ""For All Mankind"". Yes, it is an expensive DVD, but the picture and sound quality are superb.I waited a long time for this movie to become available on DVD, and I'm disappointed. The movie and the music deserved better. Overall, a missed opportunity."
3,Disappointed,To be honest I was a little disappointed with this dvd - both parts are fairly similar and centre a fair bit around the court case - I would rather have seen less of this part of Michael's life and more of his happier times
2,Skip this one,Even though it is a double feature and you might think that is great ..but it is mostly the same footage you have seen before if you have followed is career ..nothing outstanding ..I would save your money and buy a DVD of MJ live in concert .
4,very nice,love MJ can't believe he's gone several repeats in the video though; good thoughMichael Jackson: Life of a Superstar
3,difficult to follow instructions,Once I got it figured out it seems to work ok. The instructions are very difficult to follow and rely more on their terrible illustrations rather that using clear dialouge to explain. I had to have my brother figure it all out. Now that I understand it works pretty well.
5,Another Inspirational Gem from Allen,"Author Jo Anne Allen keeps cranking out some wonderfully inspiring books and ""He Will Not Depart From It"" is another classic from this ambitious and talented writer. She takes readers on a what passes for a modern day divine quest.A wholesome and entertaining book for all readers but I think young adults might enjoy this book even more. The book is thoughtful and certainly shows the author's own spiritual foundation. It works for this story and is not preachy as some of these kinds of books can be.I give this The American Authors Association's highest book rating of 5 Stars."
2,Cheap and inadequate,"I tried to use it to make applesauce with, but the stand was too narrow to allow the set to sit over even a medium-sized bowl. I tried setting it on my stock pot, but in spite of its small volume, it was too tall to fit over my medium-sized stock pot. Compared to other sieve and pestle sets I've used, this is inadequate, cheaply made, too small, and not worth the $40 price tag. I plan on taking it back to the store and exchanging it for something better, or even store credit; it's not a kitchen tool worth owning."
5,Real New Mexican Food,"I am a native of New Mexico and have loved the cooking of this region all my life. Having moved to Arizona as a young child, it was hard to find mexican food that tastes like ""New Mexican"" food. There is a difference and reading this book and using the recipes have allowed me to taste the original flavors in my own home. Not only are the recipes original and delicious, but the story of this family is especially interesting and in itself ""flavorfull"". Great book!"
5,recipes and history,A delightful book that offers a history to go along with this popular regional cooking style. Informs of the process and orgins.Charming
1,Recipe is in error,"The first thing I tried to make from the book was the pumkin empanaditas. The filling recipe turned out way too liquid to put into an empanada round. I think it is a pumpkin pie recipe. And, it makes way too much for the amount of dough. So just get some canned pumkin puree and mix with brown sugar and allspice to taste. It will be thick and dry enough to mound on the shell.I plan to try another recipe but will study it more closely before cooking."
2,Reminded me why I buy organic,"These shorts reeked of formaldehyde--an extremely strong petrol-like smell. I was shocked. I've had to wash them many times, soaked in baking soda and vinegar. Really a waste of money to support a company that treats its clothes and the environment in such a reckless way. But practically just a huge hassle to have to wash these clothes so many times to get the smell out. if you don't mind that then the seller is good and they seem to fit well."
2,Moving shorts,"I bought these shorts for running and possibly spin but will probably only use them for yoga - in my house - from now on. I took them on a long trail run the other day, and they rode up quite a bit. It was annoying. They look great but are low on function."
2,Legs ride up too much,"I returned these because, like a few other reviewers, I found that the legs rode up too much which I found to be uncomfortable. I liked the weight of the fabric and the fit, minus the legs not staying down."
4,By far my favorite pair!,"I love the way these fit me and that's a very personal thing. So, take this into consideration when reading my review. I wear these to play volleyball in. My first pair of these spandex boy shorts lasted 3 very grueling summers of outdoor grass doubles volleyball. Very comfortable and durable."
3,Decent quality for the price.,"I bought these because they were very reasonable, but when I got them, I realized they weren't really what I was looking for. The inseam is a decent length and these shorts a decent thickness- thick enough to hide undies but not awkwardly thick or anything. However, these aren't really what I'm looking for. They don't wick away moisture very well and they DEFINITELY ride up if you're running. I found that I had to readjust these shorts every 5 minutes or so. I'll use these for biking or yoga, but I doubt I'll be using them for running again."
3,Too small,"They are compression shorts- much tighter than I thought they'd be. Quality is great though, and the price was good so I guess buy larger if you don't want them cutting in you legs"
2,Not loving these,"I don't like these shorts. They are tight, and ripped the first time I wore them. Not a big fan."
2,not great for volleyball,"I play volleyball competitively, and purchased these shorts for games and practices. They are well made and fit true to size, but the ends of the shorts roll up while playing, so I constantly have to tug on them to pull them back down. They're short enough to begin with, so when they roll up I feel like I'm giving everyone a free show."
3,Rides up,"I ordered this shorts because I needed something to use underneath my regular work out shorts. I did like the cotton blend however the legs ride up constantly, even when I'm just walking; not necessarily working out, it needs to have a tighter grip around the leg area in order for them to stay down. I will keep them to sleep in them but would only recommend purchasing if you don't mind having butt-coverage only."
4,Love these bike shorts,"After initially purchasing one pair, I subsequently purchased two more, and am thinking about ordering a few more. The seller I purchased them from had the best price by far, and shipped both orders very promptly."
3,Little long for boy shorts,These shorts are good for working out. However I do prefer my boy shorts to be a half an inch shorter. Great price though!
2,Concerns on Safety Equipment,"I liked this book a lot and would highly recommend it apart from their attitude towards safety. Their advice on self-sufficiency is valid, but I feel their attitude on safety equipment is irresponsible. In particular their suggestion to do without an EPIRB. With their experience they may get away with it but most of the readers will be relatively inexperienced.There should be no compromise on safety equipment. It is no use saying you don't want anyone to come looking for you if you get into trouble, because the SAR orhanisations have both a moral and legal obligation to do so. In addition there is the feelings of loved ones to consider.Some countries are sensible enough to insist on minimal standards of safety equipment. New Zealand's ""Category 1"" standard provides a good guide to minimum requirements."
2,Not Bad,"I ordered this book with something else on a whim. I thought it would be more than just a price list, but I found some of the intros entertaining and some of the stories were interesting. I would recommend it overall."
1,Disappointment,i'm new to classic game collecting and i was really looking forward to this book. then i got it and read it. everyting but the intros are very boring and some of them are boring too. i also noticed a lot of spelling errors plus some information that is just plain wrong. i had hoped this would be a real guide to colecting but it seems like something a hobbyist threw together in his spare time. i did like seeing all the pictures boxes but i wouldnt recommend the book just for that.
1,Stay Away from DP!,"The book has many problems, but you won't see them pointed out in these reviews! The solicitation of reviews on a public and *cough* fanboy saturated message board seems shady to me."
5,"Everything you wanted to know about games, but were afraid..",This book is the ultimate resource for video game collectors.

5,"If you're into retro, this is for you","Got a machine that came out pre 1988? Then this is the guide book for you! Every major system (and plenty of minor ones) from the start of computing is detailed, along with guides to their software catalogs. Rarities and prices listed to give an indication on how much you should spend and to gauge value for a collectors view, not dealers or eBay."
5,The ultimate retrogaming collector's book - bar none,"Quite simply the BEST book on the hobby of retrogaming available. Incredibly comprehensive, insightful, and useful - We use it constantly and we're videogame professionals. This book is so good that even though we have the 6th edition, we went ahead and ordered the new 7th edition and are eagerly awaiting it's arrival."
5,The Definitive Classic Gaming Guide,"If you're a collector of vintage video games, you owe it to yourself to get a copy of this book. It is the most thorough guide for 8-bit gaming platforms you're going to find. Inside you'll find various systems, from Atari through Nintendo, with complete U.S. & foreign cartridge & rarity listings.

A must-buy!"
1,There are better books out there to spend your money on...,"This book is full of errors and is definitely NOT the definitive guide for classic gaming, as is claimed by solicited reviewers of this guide. I'd suggest alternatives to this book, but this is the only one I've read so far. There are websites out there that are free and provide much more accurate and detailed information, along with photographs and bios, that serve as better resources for those interested in classic gaming..."
2,Wasn't the success I thought it would be,both my cat (2 years) and kitten (3 months and eats anything) would put one in their mouths and just spit it back out onto the floor.i seem to find that cats are very unlike dogs... not real big on treats.
5,GREAT DRIVE AT A GREAT PRICE!!!,"I just purchased the Maxtor 80GB Internal Hard Drive and I have to say it's great! VERY easy to install, VERY FAST and quiet as well. If you are looking for a hard drive for extra storage and not too expensive then this is the one! Very pleased with the purchase!"
2,Don't take chances...,"I bought this drive for a custome built computer. I have used a few maxtor HD's before but I havent used one in any of my own computers. This hard drive worked for about 4 months. then my computer started crashing randomly. I thought it was because I had a virus (and incident with Kazaa) so I tried re-installing XP. During installation, setup said that some files wern't installed but i could go on and run XP without some. After installation the computer still randomly restarted. a few days later when I booted up, I headrd a horrable grinding noise and my comp quit working all together. Yes it was the hard drive all along. dont take chances with maxtor. western digital has much more stable and dependable hard drives"
2,yes it does crash...,"in fact mine hasn't completed its imminent hard crash yet...it just burns for 30 minutes then quits...no excess heat anywhere in the case...no software bug...it's this HD...i won't rag on them totally, they have almost decent externals...except they don't vent well...""it's been a good HD and now it has to die...""z"
2,watch out!!!,"I purchased this piece of grap for a reburhished computer that I am working on. The jumper selection is basically trial and error selection. Good luck determining from the picture where the H>> you're supposed to put the jumpers to determine master or slave settings.Most hard drives have the settings on the hard drive itself...this one does not!!!I've been fooling with it for two days and still can't get the software that comes with it to acknowledge that the hard drive is there. Take my advice and stick with Western Digital, I am from now on!!!!"
3,Drive works as promised but software is buggy,I picked up this hard drive to replace an aging smaller hard drive. I have in the past purchased Maxtor drives and used the Max-Blast software to transfer my files to the new drive and never experienced a problem. This time the software seemed to be lacking. Windows XP would not boot to the new drive once the swap was made. I needed to replace the old drive and download a third-party program to do what the Max-Blast software was supposed to do. The transfer of system files to a new computer is integral to the easy use of a new hard drive. I can't recommend something that requires the user to purchase additional items for use.
2,*WARNING* Maxtor Warranty May Not Be Honored.,"Maxtor made fine products, but they were purchased by Seagate in 2006 and they decided to discontinue the Maxtor line. Anything with the Maxtor name will have been made on or before that year, and Seagate may not honor the warranty of anything that old.Get the serial number from the seller and go to the Seagate website to determine warranty status before making a purchase! Hard drives can fail right out of the box. If Seagate doesn't honor the warranty, you may be buying a very expensive paperweight!"
5,Great drive at an great price!,"I'm running this drive as my primary master and a comparable Western Digital (old boot drive) as my primary slave. Although the documentation is skimpy, it is adequate and it describes scenarios for replacing your boot disk or just adding another drive.The included installation software is easy to use It provides for partitioning, allocating volumes and copying files between drives. Very nice and fast.Jumper settings are clearly indicated in the documentation. I had no trouble by setting both drives to for ""Cable Select"" and using the cable that came with this drive. My computer is niticeable faster now.Good show!"
2,Beware of issues,"I have used this for a couple years.It isn't very durable. Shortly after I began using it had to put a nylon strap around it to hold it together.Also the knob that you tighten to hold the sharpening ""sticks"" is not easy to work with and doesn't hold very good unless you use a pliers to tighten it in place. This is a problem since the knob is hard to get at with your fingers and/or pliers.Save some money by just using your electric drill to sharpen it or get a higher end product. You just need to match the angle of the sharpening with the angle of the chainsaw teeth."
3,Cuttin' up,"I like the product and once I figured out how to use it I was happy. I think it should come with better instructions as I had to figure it out by looking at a couple of pictures and I am still not sure if I am using it right, but I am able to cut what I need."
5,Very durable,I love this product. It has more power than others ones I tried. I would recommend this product to all the customers.
3,The interviews are not that good,"It could be Ian Glasper's fault, but I am more inclined to blame the bands interviewed. Sure, there is great stuff crammed between the covers. Demob, The Samples, Mau Maus, The Wall, The Defects and (especially) The Partisans interviews were real stand outs to me. Oh, and the Discharge feature is great. A lot of the bands though are pretty dim and dull though and all the bands that reformed in recent years will all tell you that it was for the love of punk rock and not for the money. That is just bogus.A big let down was the Exploited article. Glasper didn't even speak to Wattie and the U.K. Subs article doesn't even feature Charlie Harper. Those are silly omissions!I think this is the weaker of Glasper's books. I think ""The Day the Country Died"" seemed to go out of it's way to speak with core members of the bands featured making for a more interesting read."
5,Go Grandma!,"Okay, I won't hide the fact from you that May Tang is my grandma. So naturally I'm biased. She's an amazing lady who has lived a life almost as remarkable as her father about whom this book is about.Read it."
5,Oregon - The Best!,"This is the third set of chain and bar combo I've used with my Echo chain saw. The Oregon is head and shoulders superior to the others! The chain is sturdy and sharp, cutting faster than others I've used. Recommend without reservation!"
5,Chain and Bar package,Good quality and good price would recomend to everyone that needs these items. Used this for many years.Would purchase again.
3,"smells great, but no thickness to it","the smell is wonderful, but when you actually put it on your lips, it's very thin... not like the thick (moisturizing), chap protecting lip balm i'm used to..."
5,Better than Chocolate!,"I love the whole body of work that Julia Cameron has done to support and encourage Creatives. I keep this one close at hand and read from it on days when I need a quick boost or I don't have time for something more extensive and time-consuming. A single small page at a time, with a couple of notable quotes and a short, affirming prayer. Just the thing when you are on the fly and you want to stay on course as you are going..."
4,Transitions -- something for everythin,This was my all time Julia Cameron favorite. Something to seek out when in crisis -- like a prayer book for the spiritual personality. Very helpful.
2,Not Acurate,Non of these analog gauges are accurate. They will work in a pinch but they can be off as much as 10 degrees very easily. Save yourself the trouble and get a digital thermometer.
3,Not very accurate,"These meters are just not very accurate at all. They will show you temperature and humidity shifts, but the readings are questionable. I totally believe that you could have two of these right next to each other and have them read different numbers. I give this product 3 stars because it is cheap and although the readings may be questionable, it will still show you a rise/fall in temperature and humidity, alerting you that a change to the environment needs to be made. There are digital options for a little bit more money that are a lot better."
2,Waste of money :(,"Velcro absolutely does not stick. It felt off the wall 2 days after attaching - and would not stick to [clean, dry] glass at all afterwards. What a waste :("
2,"Shipped fast, but product is complete waste","I was going to use this with the Zoo med nt 3 terrarium.When I first got the package the room temperature seemed slightly higher than indicated by my digital thermometer.After I installed it into the terrarium, the temperature was still showing higher than it actually was (I have 2 other independent digital thermometers installed in the terrarium at the same level and area as a back up to see if one goes whack)Next, the humidity measure was also way off, my terrarium needs to maintain high humidity (90%+) both of my other humidity measures agreed that humidity was kept at or over 90% while this product jumped between 80% - 50%.In my opinion this product is way over priced and does not live up to its promises, just go digital (buy a couple units to make sure they agree on temperature and humidity levels if you're paranoid like me on reliablity)"
4,Zoo Med Thermometer & Humidity guage,I got this to use in an egg incubator. It's easy to read & works great.Zoo Med Dual Thermometer and Humidity Gauge
2,Thermometer is fine but humidity is WAY off,The thermometer is fine. It's within about 2 degrees of what my calibrated thermometr reads. That's the most I really expect out of this.The humidity indicator is *WAY* off however. It reads 65% when there's really 40% humidity. That's a big problem.
4,Real Good Live Set,"I have had this Set for so long.I think this set Captures the Group at it's Artistic peak,however you can see the shift with Michael Coming fully into His own&that alone is what kinda seperates the vibe going on here.but overall this is a Real Good Set.I would have given this set a 5 if it were a two disc set and if it included more songs from ""Destiny"",""Triumph""&songs like ""Let me Show you the Way to Go""&Michael's ""You Can't Win"" from the Wiz.I think playing it too safe hurts the Set a bit.we all know the Hits are coming but if they made this a Double Set&thrown in more newer Material then this would have been a ELite Live Set.still it's really Good to me nevertheless.and after seeing the Michael 30 Year Tribute Show last Year it's time for a updated Live set with MJ&Family."
4,Highly Recommended If You Enjoy Native American Flute Music,"One night while writing e-mail, I had the Soundscapes channel of our local cable network on in the background, mostly ignoring it. A cut from Alluvia was so good that it made me look up to see who the artist was... quite a surprise. I listened to the cuts available on Amazon.com and ordered the CD the next morning.Alluvia is not meditation music. It is infectious, talented Saturday morning feel-good music. If you enjoy the genre, you'll really like Alluvia."
2,No Pickle Flavor,"I assume ""Cajun Dill"" tastes nothing like "" regular Dill"". I wouldn't have known these were Dill flavored by tasting them -- 0% pickle flavor; not even a hint. They tasted more like ""Lawry Seasoned Salt Flavored"" Potato Chips. They looked liked Lays but were thicker and more crunchier (but not in a good way). I won't be buying these again, I didn't finish the bag. I'll stick to Dill flavored Pringles :/"
3,Loses the magic,"The original Books of Magic had wonderful, quirky dialogue that's mostly missing in the Names of Magic. NoM reads like the screenplay for a B-grade spy movie. If the characters weren't the same I'd say this didn't belong to the BoM series at all.NoM does tie up some loose ends, but not all of them, and not in a particularly satisfying way - the fight between good and evil for instance. I can't believe Araquel's whole purpose boiled down to that."
1,Garbage! You pay for what you get,"Thinking these might be good for the price I was yet again fooled by my own ignorance. You clearly get what you pay for in tools... I can't stress this enough. I'm not going to preach Snap-*N on M@tco..etc... We know they are worth it. But my entire collection isn't all those, you gotta have cheaper tools or you'd go broke.These are VERY soft metal. These will strip WAY before you strip the actual bolt that you are trying to tighten or loosen... good bad... who knows but the tollerance on these are not good either. Stuck one in bolt and it was loose in the head of the bolt...Would I recommend.. Nope. They are garbage. Save your money and get something better...-Nigel"
1,Not in stock (Deception),"When I ordered a set of SAE and metric 9-inch T-handle allen wrenches from CVF Supply/Amazon the system stated they were in stock when I processed my order. A few days after the transaction I recieved an e-mail that the metric wrenches were not in stock. I called CVF Supply (seller) and was informed that they claimed they were in stock for my order because ""the buyer thought he would be able to get some soon."" I guess CVF Supply and Amazon's definition of ""in stock"" is rather loose."
4,T-Handle Allen Wrench Set,I was pleased with the metal handles instead of plastic. These should do the job for many years!
2,"One fantastic song, but that's it","Aldo Nova's ""Fantasy"" was one of those rare songs that I loved the very first time I heard it. Eighteen years after its release, it still sounds great blasting out of a car stereo. As for the rest of his debut . . . well, Aldo's not the only one to have one great song on an otherwise mediocre album. Unfortunately, the album really hasn't stood the test of time, but if you went to high school in the early eighties, it'll bring back some memories."
4,"""I've got love comin' out of my ears""","""Hot Love... in the night, oh baby you're so hot, and let me make this clear... I've got love comin' out of my ears"". When Aldo sings of the urgent rush of teenage love he speaks for all of us. Lyrically, the thesaurus may desert him fron time to time, but there's an honesty, a naked passion here that I still find endearing, nearly 20 years after first hearing this record. Ball And Chain is the tear-jerker to end all tear-jerkers; Fantasy the killer opener, It's Too Late a personal favourite - the lyrics to which have a deep personal meaning, ...Here's to Aldo and his love-spilling ears!"
5,A Sound Unto Itself,"I know that this album was made in the early Eighties,but to me it has a faint echo of the complex arrangements and ethereal sounds of its precursors from ""Yes"" and ""Pink Floyd"", the ""moonscape"" and atmospheric sounds,and the echo chamber quality of the singer's voice. It has all that without getting tedious as some of the music by the aforementioned artists can do. This is a great album for getting a flavor of that music without having to committ wholeheartedly,because as earlier reviewers say,it also has the power-ballad/early hair metal flavor also to keep it grounded and listenable.Just a great album by a great musician."
2,ONLY FOR THE NOSTALGIC,"I was thrilled when I got hold of this cd, going through the songs in my mind, ""...heart to heart, oh eye to eye, love is lie..."". But something has happened during the 20 odd years without any Aldo Nova - this is not as good I once thought. Something I did realize now is that Aldo Nova's voice is a bit annoying and the sound of the record feels very time typical. I even found out that the songs weren't that good as I revisited my musical youth. This was some kind of a disappointment `cos I remember how I loved this album years ago.But it's not all bad, some songs are better than others and they are ""Fantasy"", ""Hot love"" and ""Heart to heart"". For nostalgic reasons I find the album worth it's money but if you've never heard Aldo Nova I don't think you should invest in this album."
4,Great Collection of Songs,"I bought this album back in the early nineties and have always enjoyed it. Although the album sounds a little dated, that doesn't take away the quality of songs like ""Fantasy"" and ""You're My Love."" Aldo has a unique voice like I've never heard before or after. He's easily identifiable and has his own vocal style. The songs have energy, and this album sports some very good ballads that are very moving to listen to. Good collection of listenable songs."
5,Excellent and well written music and lyrics by Aldo.,"if you are a fan of bon Jovi, Survivors or Bryan Adams, then you'll love Aldo Nova. Canadian rock musician with powerful songs and style of a 80's pop rock/ metal sound. I give 5 stars."
5,Good lost gem,This record is another underated Canadian heavy metal artist. The sound is like a cross between Europe and Sammy Hagar. The guitar solos are above average. It is decent early 80's metal. Check this one out.
3,good enough product.,"this was a lot smaller than i expected. the extra hair pieces were a mess to play with. otherwise, a fun way to pass the time for a young child. the barrettes worked fine and the doll is pretty."
1,"Brilliant film, atrocious quality DVD","Oscar Micheaux's 1919 WITHIN OUR GATES is a brilliant, complex feature film that is worth watching multiple times. I purchased this company/individual's version of the DVD and was extremely disappointed. I urge you to not waste your money. The DVD image quality is truly terrible, the music soundtrack is lousy, and there is even a break in the film when the projectionist changes reels. (This last detail adds an almost comical element to this DVD!) I have seen this film multiple times and did not have these issues with other versions/formats of the film -- these problems are specific to this particular DVD seller. The image quality of this DVD is so bad that I wonder if it is a transfer from some kind of bootleg VHS video from the 1970s. Don't buy from this vendor, find another place to purchase this DVD, so you can appreciate this important work of cinema history."
4,Safer Felling Wedge For Chain Saws,After years of using the metal felling wedge I decided to try this Oregon #23565 Plastic Felling Wedge. The metal wedge has its pros and cons as well as the plastic wedge. The main benefit with the plastic felling wedge is with an accidental contact of the wedge by the chain saws cutting chain. It will still dull the cutter but not destroy the chain as a metal felling wedge may do.
4,Plastic? Good and Bad.,"These wedges work quite well. I do wish they were a tad thicker at their thickest end. Also they deform a bit when driven into a kerf. The hammer blows will smash the plastic. This hasn't been an issue so far, but eventually they'll probably be so beaten up that they won't really work well.On the other hand, I accidentally nicked one with the chainsaw once. Because the wedge was plastic it just cut it a bit without causing any damage to, or dulling, the chain.I can live with replacing a few wedges now and again when I have the security of knowing that they can't hurt my chain."
5,"plastic cutting wedges ""Oregon""",Just as advertised.. how can plastic wedges be anything other than what you expect. Oregon Cutting Systems #23565 Plastic Wedge
2,plastic wedge,"I thought it might be of use in splitting some locust pieces that a neighbor had trimmed from his property and the trimmer had kindly knocked up into fireplace size pieces for me. I also bought the Fiscar ax. I didn't understand that the wedge is for felling only. Actually, I didn't need the wedge, as the ax was exceeded expectations. I'll keep the wedge and find some use for it."
5,love these shoes,"I have worn these Klogs at work in a busy ICU for several years. They are the most comfortable shoes Ive ever owned. My feet never hurt no matter how busy the shift. They are very durable- Ive owned one pair for over 3 years and they look brand new. The insoles wear oput every 6 months or so- but insoles can be purchased from the Klogs catalog for about $10....I highly recommend theses shoes to anyone who wants affordability, durability and comfort."
3,"Good, but GREATEST HITS 1 & 2 are much better!","I'm a big Barbra Streisand fan but I must say that MEMORIES is a rehash. Don't get me wrong, the songs are great, but numerous songs are available on many other Streisand albums.There are a few newly recorded songs. ""Memory"" and ""Comin' In and Out of Your Life"" both made their first appearences on this album, but are also availiable on the much better A COLLECTION: GREATEST HITS . . . AND MORE. That leaves ""New York State of Mind"" and the solo version of ""Lost Inside of You"" (formerly a duet From A STAR IS BORN) as the only two exclusive songs.Is the whole album worth buying for just these two songs? If you are a fanatical Streisand fan (like me) then YES! However, everyone else would be better off buying GREATEST HITS Volumes 1 & 2. Those two albums give a much better presentation of her work."
1,Unususal Compilation,Contains too many songs which are found on other Greatest Hits packages. Inessential for all but the Barbra Streisand completists.
5,Great Collection of Songs,"Memories from CATS makes this CD worth its purchase. The ease of order, quick shipping and great condition of the product upon receipt made this one of the easiest purchases I've made in a long time. I have been looking in stores for month and couldn't find this particular CD."
3,Not a match made in heaven,"Yes, the camera work is frustrating, but with so many singers and dancers on stage, the only unobstructed sightlines might be from the Goodyear blimp. I think there is also a conceptual problem with the work of art. The prima ballerina who doesn't sing and the tenor who doesn't dance are not only separated by death but by artistic genre. This is not a match made in heaven. (But I'll use chapter selection to enjoy Ananiashvili's Cleopatra dance.)"
4,Superb !,Superb! One of the major works written by Rimsky Korsakov. I can't understand why Mlada is never performed nowadays in western countries.
4,sheets,"They are a little heavier, probably more suitable for winter time. They are alittle warm to sleep under in the summer."
5,The best sheets that I have ever owned!,"These are the softest, plushiest (if thats a word) sheets that I've ever slept on. I stayed at at the Ritz Carlton and I have finally found sheets even better than theirs. You can't go wrong with these sheets, especially at a good price."
5,"Knew it, loved, love it still.","Mr. Dylan has been for a long time an outspoken artist I really engoy, he speaks to my soul. Go ahead & take differance(with me),however ""even the president of the United States must sometimes stand naked."" Dec.12,1998"
5,One of the finest live rock and roll albums,"Oh to have caught the tour from which we have this artifact! This is epic stuff -- the funky, loose-limbed Band helping rock and roll's greatest songwriter deliver his hits to an arena audience. Take special note of Like a Rolling Stone and Blowin in the Wind. Play them loud."
2,Don't Buy the MP3 Version!,"I would like to echo a comment that was made in an earlier review, which I should have read before purchasing the MP3 version of this album. The MP3 version has been altered to remove the audience sounds between tracks, and thus each track has a shorter running time than it should. When I figured this out, Amazon gave me a refund and I purchased the CD version. The CD version does not have this problem. If you are interested in this album, buy the CD version, as it is much more enjoyable when it actually sounds like a concert with the audience sounds. You also get a booklet with the CD version (though it isn't much, with just a few pictures). Others have commented on the performance itself and the high quality of the 2009 remaster. I would give the CD version 4 or 5 stars, but I am lowering my rating due to the problems with the MP3 version."
5,Great,"This cd is truly one of the best. It takes the greatest songwriter of all time with a great Band behind him. It is a live collection of some of the best hits that these performers have realeased. The quality of the recordings is also excellent, making it more than worth it. Stuff like this doesnt come around often."
5,And Then Some,"This is the epitome of rock for me. Other songs and, yes, even other albums are better but none stirs as deeply as this set. Even better I got to hear recently one of the bootlegs floating around from this tour. And some of it is truly amazing, including a version of Forever Young. Now that I know more tapes of this stuff exists, I keep hoping we'll get a re-release here with bonus tracks. Maybe another whole set. Robbie Robertson, Garth Hudson and Dylan are all on fire here, not to mention Danko, Helm and Manuel. Ignore this at your own loss."
5,The Band and Bob Dylan Rockin,Bob dylan is great in this alblum with songs like Rainy Day Women 12 and 35 and Knockin on Heavens Door but dont let Bob Dylan overshadow The Band who are great with songs like The Night They Drove Ole Dixie Down one of my favorites
2,this is a good cd what a joke,This cd is lame no matter what the quality of the remastering sound. Lay lady lady is horrible . The shouting singinging style is a joke . I'm confused on the rave reviews . I bought this cd when it first came out and it still is not any better now despite the better sound.
2,Get The Originals,"Interesting performances, essential for Dylan fans. I for one am not enamored with Dylan on this album. His performances are energetic but he often spits out each song with little hint of the original melody. Infact he makes each song sound exactly the same barking out the end of phrases with the same growl and pitch. Songs are shortened and rushed through with a tone that doesn't sound like earlier Dylan, mid Dylan or later Dylan. I also grew tired of jo o ones and gur hur hurl after first hearing. He must have been on something at the time. Also, the band sounds good but they dont add anything to their repertoire with these renditions. Only of historic significance, get Highway 61, Blonde on Blonde etc. first."
3,sounds like same song over and over...,"That's my main beef with ""Before The Flood."" It sounds like the same exact song over and over again. There are some exceptions like ""Most Likely You Go Your Way"" and ""Don't Think Twice It's Alright"" but all the other songs for the most part sound EXACTLY the same...same singing, same tempo, same guitars and drums playing the same notes as the previous track. I understand Dylan would often shake up the arrangements in concerts so they won't sound too much like the studio version (something that can horribly backfire to the point where the lyrics are the only way you can tell what song it is...this means you, ""Just Like A Woman"") but for some reason he decided with this concert he would just play one 2-hour song. Dylan was never that great a singer but I'm still trying to figure out why on songs like ""Lay Lady Lay"" he screams the rhyming word in each verse. Weird. Overall it's not a really bad album, it's just a bit redundant."
5,Look Here,Look this is a very good live album with some real sound. If you love The Band and Bob then this is a must album. Bob and The Band combined in this album is a treat and especially if you love their classics done in rock with a very electrical instrumental sound. So if you like it a bit loud then you'll like this. They all put heaps of effort into this live version and it is one of the best ways they have done their songs combined. When I saw that these two legendary acts had combined live for this album to do their songs I had to have it and if you think you know what your gonna get then you have to have a listen first.
4,Excellent but incomplete,"The songs and playing are excellent, although not quite up to the standard of ""Live 66"" (of course, what is?) But what happened to the other great songs from the tour, like ""Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues"" or ""Ballad of Hollis Brown""? Hopefully, Columbia will soon wise up and release the complete album (which does exist)."
5,Very good,I thought the quality of the cassette was great as was the sound and genre of the music. Highly recommended
2,The Band Ruins This One,"Dylan is at the top of his game and the sound is much improved - too bad so much time is wasted on The Band and their mediocre songs when there was a legend present. If it was all Dylan would be 5 stars, ZERO stars for The Band."
4,Google Hacks a book you must have,"A few years ago someone had mentioned this book to me if I was interested in learning the next level of Google. I was able to locate it at my local library and continued to check this book out over several months. This is a great reference for understanding the dynamics of the search capabilities within Google. I wouldn't treat this book like a one time beginning to end chapter book but as an ongoing guide for quick tips. Combine this book with what you are working on in Google Adwords, Google Adsense and Google Analytics. Without any other prior knowledge of managing SEO Content I took this book as my literal guide to build my ranking on Google and it works! Well worth the investment."
5,Google Hacks is a Must Have Book,"This book is a must on your bookshelf if you are a Google power user or a developer who in interested in making Google work for you and your customers. It tells the whole Google story, where it came from, how it became so popular and how to take advantage of the greatest search engine ever.This is the book by which all other books about Google will be measured. Don't go searching without it!"
3,"GOOD, FAST READ FOR THE LAYMAN. DO YOU KNOW GOOGLE LABS?","If you are looking for a compilation of googling tips and tricks in a neatly bound format, with a useful index and great visuals, this little collection is as good as it gets. The book is expected O'Reilly cadre -- crisply written by pros who aren't winging it.Yet, it still puzzles me why this info was necessary in a book form, particularly given the most likely intended audience. Most or even ALL of this info is available either on Google itself, especially on ""Google Labs"", or on frequently read websites such as Slashdot or Kuro5hin.Recommended if you want to skip some on-computer reading, but I am still waiting to find tricks here that I haven't found elsewhere on the net for a whopping $0.00."
3,Not much help to a regular researcher,"I do lots of web-based research for my job. I have to find obscure statistics, reports, papers, articles, and various other difficut-to-find information. I thought that this book would help me use Google more effectively, but really it didn't. It is more for computer buffs rather than researchers who use Google for research. A lot of the suggestions and tips involved using some kind of code which I didn't know what it meant and a lot of them were silly kind of things like how to make your screen appear backwards or upside down. It covered the basic important things like ""word order matters,"" and how to use ""and"" and ""or"" when searching. There were a few slightly helpful tips, but not enough to make it worth it to buy the whole book. I'm sure the book might be great for other purposes, just not for your run-of-the-mill researcher who is pretty computer savy, but not really ""into"" computers for a hobby."
4,If you are a web developer,I am a beginner web developer. I heard a lot about this book and heard I should get it. From the content I read it is outstanding but a little advanced. And for actual web developing and understanding Google there is only one chapter that focused on what I needed.And in my opinion was worth the buy. And frankly I didn't want to share this review because I don't want my competition knowing the secrets. There was a reason this was a best seller. The section about how to get 15K visitors a day makes you take a hard look at your current website. It provides the rights and wrongs and hints at sticking with legitimate website building techniques. Keeps you honest. Which is the way it should be. And for that honesty you get rewarded handsomely on the search engine.
4,Great Resource,"If you want a great resource to maximize your Google search, the first 90 pages or so are for you. I have picked up quite a few tricks that I now use everyday in my research at work.The bulk of the book deals with the API, and writing applications with it, or integrating it into your exisiting web pages. The next 40 pages or so get you started and are at a level that almost any web developer can understand and apply.After that, the book hits the API pretty hard, and you are going to need a Google Developer key, and some knowledge or Perl or other scripting language to really make use of it. Even if you dont regularly use Perl, if you know any script at all you can follow along, and it is actually very interesting.If you are looking for a end-to end Google user's guide, you will find some of that here, but web developers will benefit most."
3,Expert only?,"This book isn't as fun and easy as it sounds. I was able to play with a few ""hacks"", but on the whole, I didn't find this book too user-friendly or easy to comprehend."
2,Google Geeks Beware,"Dont make the same mistake I did: on the advice of numerous sites around the net (/. for one), this book is supposed to deliver loads of new material to both novice and veteran googlers. To the former, definately, as for the latter, there is nothing in this book you have not picked up already."
2,Misleading Title,"The bulk of this book deals with applications created using the Google API. Even the discussion of the API itself is limited. All of the hacks relevant to the search engine itself are contained in the Google Pocket Guide.If you are looking for ideas on what can be done with the Google API, or how to use the applications that others have written, then this book might be for you. However, if you are looking for tips and things to tinker with - hacks, regarding the search engine, do not bother with this book."
4,Be sure to read the reviews before you purchase,"If you are looking for a book on the Google API and how to do better searching on Google, this book is outstanding. If you are looking for a book to give you lots of tips on improving your Google search engine ranking, this isn't the right book.I do a LOT of research on the Internet and this book has been extremely useful in narrowing my searches so that I sift through ""less junk"". The countless hours this book has saved me has paid for it many times over.I haven't done any Google API programming, so I don't have any opinion on that part of the book (which is the majority of the book)."
5,GOOGLE HACKS comes packed with usage tips not to be found elsewhere.,"Almost anyone who uses a computer knows that Google is a superior search engine - but do you know it also offers ways to organize and manipulate that information? The updated third edition of GOOGLE HACKS: TIPS & TOOLS FOR FINDING AND USING THE WORLD'S INFORMATION tells how, with chapters covering not just search techniques or advanced search strategies, but what to do with the information once it's found. From building a customized Google map for your web site to handling RSS feeds, news listings, blogs, and even using Gmail as an external hard drive, GOOGLE HACKS comes packed with usage tips not to be found elsewhere.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"
3,Fun but small and disorganized,"I admit I should have looked more closely at the info on this book, none of the reviews mention how SMALL this book actually is. I was somewhat taken aback when I saw it, it's really small. This has a very unfortunate effect as the pictures are also very small and less enjoyable as a result. The book also jumps around a lot. It might have been more enjoyable to see it wrapped into some type of narrative structure. As it stands it's kind of a jumbled up mass of disconnected paragraphs and too small photos. It's not a total loss but could have been MUCH better. Considering the amount of material collected it could have really added up to a much better book."
3,Kid Friendly Sandwich Maker - Plastic Closure Breaks,"This is just your basic sandwich maker. The rivet in the middle cuts the sandwich in half, which is both good & bad. Good for the kids since they get an pre-cut sandwich, but bad because our bread slices are just a little too big for the maker (which, I think is sized for wonder bread sizes). It does the job and is not real hard to figure out, so no complaints there.I bought this sandwich maker at a huge, huge discount, so when the front closure broke off, I didn't see a lot of money down the drain. The machine still works, but you have to hold the top down manually. Hubby thinks he can superglue the piece back on, but hasn't done it yet. The machine lasted over about 1-1/2 years before breaking."
2,A Movie isn't Sociology for God's sake!,"I keep seeing these complaints that Gibson ""failed to shed light on why the culture disappeared"". How in Heaven's name, could he???The Mayan culture had degenerated from a single united kingdom by 1441 (a half-century before Columbus, and 500 years after the ""classic"" period of Mayan culture had ended). The Aztec and Inca were the only remaining Mesoamerican empires by the time the Spaniards arrived in 1517, with the Old World diseases (not religion) which so weakened the already-crumbling empires that they could not resist the heavily outnumbered Spaniards.Many scientists and sociologists consider the Spanish as the symptom, rather than the disease, so to speak, since the Aztec and Inca dissolved in much the same manner as the earlier Olmec, Maya, and Toltec, which had declined well before the Spaniards. In short, if the experts can't explain it, how in God's name would you expect a Hollywood ""director"" to come up with the answers???"
1,"Too Much Blood, Violence and Running Through the Jungle","OK, I would give this film 2, maybe even 3 stars if the makers hadn't destroyed a beautiful and magnificent black jaguar. The scenery is beautiful and I really like the music. But the mean guys are over the top. The Nazis seem cuddly by comparison. Acting was good, but I just don't like so much blood. And running, running, running ad infinitum. Bought from Amazon."
2,Bizzare,"I sat down to watch this movie with absolutely NO expectations. The movie draggs on a bit... it's hard to know if this movie has any historical accuracy. Gibson portrays Myans as brutal savages. I found myself intruiged by his portrayal of their culture from the perspective of tatoos, dress, etc. Visually, it was stunning.There is over the top graphic violence... in many cases unnecessary...followed by what becomes a very long and ultimately predictable ending."
3,blahish,"Gotta go with the ole 3/5 on this one. I kept waiting for the movie to get good, maybe for some arse kicking to exact the much-needed revenge of the travesties from the beginning and it mostly never came. The movie, overall, consisted of endless savagery. Some parts were barely digestible and I considered stopping the movie simply because of its unpleasantness (not in a ""wow, that's really gory"", but ""Yeah, humans can be pretty awful, I don't think I need another example of it ostensibly wrapped up as entertainment"").Certainly there were in fact no memorable moments at all and I would be surprised if even somebody who somehow gave this 5/5 would find any reason to watch it a second time."
3,It's Mel,"It's vintage Gibson. A woman in distress and a hero to save the day. I love most Gibson movies, but I was expecting more about the Mayan downfall."
2,Very very violent but well portrayed,"This is probably one of the most bloody movies i have seen and that is saying a lot. Ok, well the acting is amazing and Mel Gibson did a good job on filming the Mayan empire almost exactly as I would imagine it to be. However, does he have to show all the blood when they sacrifice people and such? I could have done without all that. I have enjoyed the movies that Gibson has directed and been in but this movie went too far. Do not go see it if you can't stand for your stomach to turn. It will make you want to throw up."
4,Great movie,I didn't know what to expect out of this movie. But I ended up really enjoying it. I would recommend watching it. But it is for adults with a lot of violence.This movie was brutal yet very sad.
5,great movie,"though it depicts rather graphically the time of the American conquest, it is a very well done movie, helps understand the perils of the time and the life of both cultures."
2,See THE NAKED PREY and KINGS OF THE SUN instead,"APOCALYPTO(2006) Written, Produced and Directed by Mel Gibson. Score byJames Horner.A ho hum film about life in the Mayan empire before Christiancivilzation put an end to barbarism and human sacrifice. Numbinglyviolent and gory with a final half stolen from THE NAKED PREY, thisGibson film is done in by its own blood soaked excess which constantlyremoves and dulls the viewer to what is a nothing special story in anycase. J. Lee Thompson's film KINGS OF THE SUN is a far superior take onthe same material in every way.Hardly a bad film and not more violent from anything from theSAW films to DONNIE BRASCO, anti-Christian bigots set to hate this filmbecause of Gibson being a Catholic take note that you are plunging intoan intellectual cul de sac. This is a modern film in nearly everyrespect---which is to say it is for you."
5,fantastic movie,"I have this movie on blue ray disk. I have a sony hd television and played this on my playstation 3. this movie is the BOMB! I couldn't believe how clear and crisp the picture is! the surround sound was fabulous. We felt like we were in the movie. the story is easy to follow. there are subtitles, but easy to read, your not focusing on reading and missing the movie. bloody, war scenes. just like braveheart. I liked it alot. Mel Gibson came through once again! this is a movie I can watch over and over."
2,Nice if I could view the dvd.,Unable to play dvd on player (not viewable for this region). Never heard of that? Hoped to get a replacement.
5,glad i found this dvd,i saw this in cable on a saturday morning very early for the first time. i had to buy the dvd for my collection so i could have it to watch again or share. i was lucky to find hhis seller who offered it at a treat price. it arrived in brand new condition super fast. thanks.
5,APOCALYPTO,BRILLIANT MOVIE BY MEL GIBSON-PICTURE QUALITY IS EXCELLENT-AUDIO IS EXCELLENT-I LOVED THE STORY TO THIS FILM-ONE MAN ON A MISSION TO GET BACK TO SAVE HIS FAMILY - AND BEING HUNTED BY A GROUP OF KILLERS AND ONE OF THE BEST ON THE EDGE OF YOUR SEAT MOVIES OF ALL TIME-10/10
1,Pat's review,"This movie is HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If I could give it less than 1 star, I would. If you like watching body parts being eaten, and people having their heads cut off, you might like it. I watched about an hour of the movie and couldn't take it anymore."
3,Apocalypto is Vivid,"A decent adventure film, by no means as bloody as Mayan history would lead one to expect. But not complex -- most of the movie is a chase film."
4,Pleased.,"I was very happy with my movie- it was in great condition, and delivery was prompt. I'm truly enjoying it -"
4,Mel Gibson's Apocalypto,"This is one of the most exciting Action/Adventure movies up to date! Apocalyto is a very violent and gory movie, so it may not be suitable for children under the age of 13. It is quite obvious that Mel Gibson worked very hard on this motion picture. The movie in some parts can be somewhat unrealistic, but Mel Gibson still did an excellent job recapturing the Mayan culture. This is a must see for any fan of the Action/Adventure genre!"
5,A Stunning Work of Art - One of the Finest Films Ever Made,"I will make this short and sweet as there are so many reviews of this movie: ""Apocalypto"" is a modern work of art and is, perhaps, one of the finest films ever made. Visually stunning, the movie is an emotional and intellectual feast. I cannot say enough about the care, effort, and quality that went into this masterful production.Mel Gibson has a fine acting career, but this film proves he could well be (with the exception of Peter Jackson) the most gifted director we have today. Thanks to all who worked so hard to make this work of art - simply magnificent."
1,Rotten Running Man Ripoff!,"I think that this was probably one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time..... I can't believe that such a thin plot could be considered anything but rubbish! While beautifully filmed, and including some excellent actors, there just really is nothing to this story, regardless of how much blood and gore is thrown across the screen. Man is captured, his village wiped out and taken to a Mayan capital for sacrifice. He escapes, runs home while being chased by Mayan warriors, runs into Spanish conquistadors when about to be finished off, rescues his wife and kids and then wanders back into the jungle. That's it! When I think how much more could be done with this time in history and location, it makes me weep.... I strongly recommend you get a copy of 'Atztec' by Gary Jennings to get an idea of what has been missed!"
2,Gibson's Latest Fever Dream,"Yet another aimless, overwrought, adolescent Gibson film. Some directors nowadays let the technology take over their films. Gibson lets his production designers make his movies. Just add endless gore, and raging actors, and boom, another 50 million dollar drive-in movie. Somebody stop this man before he films again."
3,Excellent ingredients but weighed down by a cliched plot and unrelenting brutality,"Mel Gibson's ""Apocalyto"" follows one man's brutal journey in Mayan times from his quiet, peaceful village to hell and back again.The film has much going for it - excellent acting, makeup, costumes, production design, visual effects - which really makes you feel like you are there - but is let down by a cliched plot that contains a few too many coincidences.It is also extremely brutal and continues Gibson's obsession with human suffering following on from ""Braveheart"" and ""The Passion of the Christ""."
4,Mel Gibson's best film,"This movie has been heavily criticized by many (at least, where I live) but this is actually a great adventure film. The second half of the movie, as the hero is chased through the jungle by a group of Mayas, is terrific and breathtaking film-making, the best thing that Gibson has ever made. Of course, if cinematic violence is not your cup of tea, you might be better off skipping this film. Now, in terms of history, there are several inaccuracies that are obvious to even those of us not heavily versed on the Mayas. Though recent archaeological findings has made obvious in recent years that the Mayas practiced (as many societies throughout history) human sacrifices, the way they are portrayed here seem more related to the Aztecs. Another obvious mistake is having the Spaniards appear at the end: the Mayas had already left the cities by the time the Spanish arrived in the 16th century (for what reason, is the major mystery of the Mayas), and were living in rural villages."
4,"Plagerism: Straight ripoff of 1966 movie ""The Naked Pray""","It's hard not to enjoy this movie and be awed by it's depiction of the Mayan city right down to the blue smeared corpses at the bottom of a sacrificial pyramid. If you particularly enjoyed the jungle chase wherein the villians hunting the hero meet their demise one by one, there's another movie you might like. It's a somewhat racist classic called ""The Naked Prey"" from 1966 by Cornel Wilde. A huge chunk of Apocalypto is a straight ripoff of this movie right down to the poor chap who is bitten by a snake and left behind by his mates. This is the only thing that disappointed me about this otherwise excellent movie. [...]"
3,Over-Hyped and Violent,"This is the story of a Mayan who escapes captivity to return to the pregnant wife and son he has hidden in a well. Usually it is the kind of story that I love but this movie seemed more interested in showing needless violence than in telling the story.There was a lot of hype for this movie, especially since this is the follow-up of Mel Gibson's incredible movie ""The Passion"". But when the closing credits started rolling the person I was sitting next to asked, ""What was the point of this?"" I could give no good answer.But in the heart of Mel's other movies (like Braveheart), the cinematography is amazing. Even the story is fantastic but the end resolution left me a little bit in disbelief. I'm still looking forward to more movies from Mel Gibson but in the end I wish I had just stayed home this time around."
3,The ending ruined it,"The Maya civilization ceased to exist before the coming of the Europeans, what would have been a decent movie was ruined by placing the Europeans in that time period thereby suggesting that the Europeans played a part in the Mayan civilization demise."
3,Not Nearly As Good As Anticipated,"Well worth seeing due to the scenes in the Mayan city.This is where the movie fell short. Too much time spent running throughthe jungle which should have been spent showing the spectacularcivilization/culture in the Mayan city.Also kind of hard to indentify with the characters in the movie. As youwould with Cosner in ""Dances with Wolves"" or Mel Gibson in ""Braveheart.""The ending is kind of quirky. A 15 second shot of very huge changes to come.Inserting this 15 second glimpse into the ending made the movie seemeven more lacking than it was.Dissapointing to see a movie with so much potential come up so short."
3,Gruesome,I enjoyed the historical aspect of this film but felt it portrayed only the gruesome side of the civilization.
2,Blood and gore for its own sake.,"Mel Gibson has done it again. He has showered us with all sorts of gore. I wish he had used Mayans for this Mayan story. He used tall, long-necked Latinos; Mayans are short and do not have necks. I have been to Yucatan, Guatemala, Honduras many times, but I do not remember seeing high mountains and 200-foot waterfalls in the Mayan world. He did pick a super hero. This man took a spear through the abdomen, an arrow through the chest, survived quicksand, and then ran a marathon after being hit in the head several time with a stone axe.If a person knows a little Mayan history, one can fit the film into it, but there is very little story line."
4,"Apocalypto ""Now""","A very intense and violent film. Interesting in the adventure gender.But this film can't be considered as an historical document, severalmistakes avoid it, in special the final excene."
4,Review of Apoc by sepptagenerianalypto,"I enjoyed this unuaual movie. Though it was not historically accurate, it still gave me insight into the Mayan period.it was well acted and had enough drama to be interesting."
4,Mel's Mayan culture,"I wasn't prepared to like this film since I was not a big fan of Mel's ""Passion of the Christ"" due to the gruesome violence of the film more than the controversy surrounding it. And of course we've all heard of his meltdown in Malibu but don't let that deter you from enjoying this excellent film. The visuals and the sound are particularly impressive in Blu-ray and it fully captures what I experienced in the theatre when I first saw it. If you want an example of Hi-Def at its best do put this on or ""Blade Runner"" to test your set-up. Am looking forward to Mel's next directorial effort!!"
4,Awesome visual and sound quality,"Movie is nearly nonstop action. Other than that, I have no idea what the point of the movie was.Lots of chasing, fighting, killing, standard neanderthal barbaric brutalities. Ends abruptly."
5,"Awesome movie, ambiguous ending",I rented this on blu-ray from Netflix.The movie is incredible in HD. It's the best told naked people in the jungle movie I have ever seen.Bonus points for the seductive natives.My one complaint is the ending. I would have liked to find out what happened to the civilization portrayed in the film.I guess we will never know.
4,"Good Scenes, Excelent Video, Story...to be continued","Amazing scenes, with excelent video quality in one of the best blu-ray quality disc I've ever seen. The story don't have a proper ""end"", wich makes it a little frustrating...or, maybe, a second chapter."
5,Best film of 2006,"This film blew me away. Mel Gibson is leagues beyond in terms of cinematographic talent. The film takes viewers from uproariously hilarious opening scenes to the darkest, saddest and most terrifying scenes and back around to a ""new beginning"" with a cleverly ironic twist at the end, all in the course of a couple of hours, and without benefit of other than subtitles to carry the story and dialogue.Hollywood needs more, not fewer, Mel Gibsons. This film got me very excited to see his Jesus pic, which I've reckoned would be good but never had a strong desire to see. Not anymore; it's on my shortlist!"
4,Excellent production - Mel at his best,"Too bad that people will boycott this film because Mel can sometimes be a jackass. It's top notch in every detail. I've recommended to all my friends and relatives and after a reluctant agreement to watch, all were glad they set their feeling aside and judged the movie on it's own merits.Well worth you time. bg"
3,Mixed Feelings,"this movie is great in that it attempts to bring to life a vanished culture but I think it missed the mark regarding cultural accuracy. The Mayans were incredibly intelligent people, this movie focusses on what they are trying to portray as ignorant country folks of the Mayans who get enslaved by the elites... so it makes them look like ignorant savages from the stone age which they weren't. The Mayans had writing, high level of mathematics, agriculture, ceramic wares etc... they weren't cave people."
5,good at your seat movie,very interesting movie. is a good movie that covers mayan civilization towards its decline. I believe by the time the Spanish had arrived the Aztec civilization was at its peak. Overall the movie is awesome.
4,Not Bad!,"I liked this movie. It did not not get too into history, romance, or anything other than a few days in a man's life."
1,Representative of our moral status,"This is the kind of movie that uses pure gore, violence and creepiness to draw attention to itself. Nowadays movies that appeal to primitive emotions of human beings like savageness, sadism, hatred and intense violence for its own sake seem to make big hit. Other examples include ""Kill Bill"" and ""300"". Probably we should build a Colosseum and have naked people fight with lions to death."
1,This is a terrible movie.,I'm sorry I bought this film. Seems Gibson is fixated on oral sex and portrays the Mayan's as a bunch of rowdy soccer fan types.
3,"Interesting, but disturbing","The story telling in Apocalypto is excellent.However, the message the director is trying to send is clearly: ""These people deserved to be conquered, and deserved to have their religion largely erased"", which is more than a little disturbing."
2,Sorry to spoil the party,"if you are looking for gratuitous violence in a historically incorrect flic, go for it. the characters and cinematography is great, the rest is fed to you a la Mel Gibson. He has a point to make, a visual experience to feed you, and that is about it. I watched the movie, and at the end, the story is neither plausible, nor all that intriguing. Many of the violent scenes and dialogues are just there for Mel to show you; they do not fit in with the scheme, nor do they answer the so what question. Not bad visually, but not much of a movie either."
3,Rambo for 2000's,"The plot is basically Rambo, with some beautiful scenery and subtitles. Very gory, but that was the Mayan ""civilization."""
4,"Not quite worthy of five stars, but still very good","This is just an interesting film to watch. With most people knowing little to nothing about the Mayan civilization, this film is an eye opener for just about everyone. The visuals, costumes, make-up, and acting are all so good you will often feel like you are watching actual history on film, rather than just another hollywood epic. Mel Gibson has crafted a movie that should be around come Oscar time, especially in the technical categories.4 and 1/2 out of 5 stars"
5,Mel Gibson's Apocalypto,I love this movie..great film from long ago. It is a must see movie. Once you sit down you want to see all of it. The actors they choose for the movie did a great job. I have seen this movie so I had to get it.
3,Dear Diary: A lot happened today!,"Boy it has been quite a couple days, let me tell you. First my village was burned, and I was marched off to be sacrificed, but just as I was about to have my heart torn from my body, there was a total eclipse. Then that night there was a full moon. God sure does work in mysterious ways! Anyway, the next day, my son was born right before I saved my wife from drowning, and just as the first Europeans showed up on the beach next to my old village. Can you believe it?!? Stay tuned, dear Diary. Who knows what will happen tomorrow!"
2,"Good picture, good action, poor plot and too much gore","After watching excellent Gibson movies like like Braveheart, Passion of the Christ and Signs, I watched with disappointment Apocalypto. The movie has good picture and excellent special effects as well as action but all these good traits are constantly overshadow by an exaggerated display of gore. Now, I'm OK with gore when used to emphasize the plot but large parts of this movie seem to be the other way around: There's some plot added to emphasize the gore. I would not recommend you to buy this movie. Rent it instead."
4,Amazing film. Visually stunning,"To be blunt, I'm NO fan of Mel Gibson the person. However, I put that aside and saw this film - I was amazed. The visually stunning scenes of the Mayan city were incredible.Yes, this film has some violence. But try to get past it and just enjoy the film. It's an incredible story and is beautifully filmed.The soundtrack is haunting and beautiful.The ""making of"" feature is a bore but the film itself is a good one.I was blown away by this film. Hope you enjoy it too if you check it out."
5,Great movie!,"Mel Gibson tells a good story in a great way. Beautiful settings, great performances. A travel back in time."
5,superb,this is what cinema is made for.Mel gibson did something great and it is not a real surprise.This is a must have in a dvd collection.The beginning is a bit slow but for the rest fasten seat belt...We wish more films like that
5,apocalypto,i like this movie because is sometime of the history of America before good movie thanks mel gibson's
3,good movie but...,"I could have enjoyed this movie a lot more if the sound effects were shut out. An interesting and original topic which was filmed quite brilliantly but oh the sound track. Why or why if you wanted authenticity Mr Gibson did you not let the sound of the jungle and the village raids, etc. stand on their own? Are we viewers so dumb we need drums and other 'musical' sounds to understand the obvious? Just a point of clarity here - I thought that the sound of flutes were associated with the Incas just a few miles south of the Aztecs! Unfortunately the sound track spoilt what could have been a brilliant film for me. Why don't producers and directors keep these sound effects people in check? OK has some effects now and again but dialogue and good camera work is enough - the overt the top and inappropriate sounds are just not necessary"
3,Don't Understand The Rave Reviews...,"Credit to Gibson's vision. However, when people rave about how brutal and violent a movie is, I expect brutal violence. This film was neither brutal nor violent, considering the context. It was extremely reserved compared to what it could have been. I applaud Gibson's dedication to reality and using the original dialect, however, this tactic detracts from being able to adequately develop characters. This is a film that should have been 90 minutes or 3 hours. As it was, it should have been 90 minutes of action/drama. I would have preferred a film that was 3 hours long that presented characters that I actually cared about. How can I care whether a guy gets his heart cut out, if I don't even know anything about that character? This film could have been so much more. I was disappointed."
2,Apocalypto - Mel Gibson,"This is the first movie, either as an actor, or a producer/director that in my opinion Mel Gibson bombed out. The movie is boring and a waste of money to purchase. It's important that people know that the movie shows little about the ancient Mayan society."
2,Powerful but disappointing,"While this is a powerful portrayal of the Mayan culture, it lacks both breadth and depth (not what I have come to expect from Mel Gibson). The Mayan people were so much more than what is depicted here. Without a context in which to fully understand this film, one would assume the Mayans were little more than savages, when in fact they had a well developed civilization. Not recommended!"
2,Not too good --,"I bought this movie in blu-ray format - and the clarity (quality) did not dissappoint. Excessive violence - and I still battle with having to ""read"" the entire movie. Subtitles distract from watching what is happening. Just my opinion!"
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:At its best Apocalypto is a kinetic chase film, but the first hour drags something awful and the unnecessary and flawed subplot with Jaguar Paw's wife in the giant hole slowed down the action further; Apocalypto is certainly recommended to action fans, but it's not a very accomplished film."
1,Thinly masked torturefest.,"This may very well be the worst film I've ever seen. The setting of the Mayans and Aztecs attracted me to the movie in the first place, but it's merely the coat of paint thrown on a completely pointless and barbaric film.From scene one, this movie is grotesque. Mel attempts to connect us with the Mayans with an opening scene of tricking the fat kid into eating pig balls, then rubbing hot peppers onto his privates. And it just goes downhill from there.The whole film feels like an excuse to film the horrific acts Gibson seems to have become obsessed with. Near the end, it's like they suddenly remember they need some sort of confrontation and resolution, and it's like he just went down the list of movie cliches in order. In two minutes I saw every bad trick to build tension ever concieved.I'm disgusted that Apocalypto is selling so well. Or even at all for that matter. It's a horrible film."
1,Blue Ray Case Deceptive,I didn't buy this movie on regular DVD because I DID NOT WANT TO READ THE MOVIE I wanted to watch it and listen to it!!! I bought this movie on Blue Ray because the case said it had an optional 5.1 English sound track --- but it did not! Both the uncompressed sound track and the 5.1 sound track are in the obscure language. The only English sound track is the commentary by the director.
5,Pure Excitement,Mel Gibson has done an excellent job presenting a very disturbing subject. The narrated directors cut is a must.
4,Fast paced and right on target but really 3 and a half stars.,"Very little acting, and almost a documentary, but a fast paced action movie none the less. You've read the other reviews so probably know what it's all about by now (the film contains a little bit of everything), but understand there is a story, and the director, Mel Gibson, never loses sight of it. The theme is not original, however it's locale is, and the cinematography is superb. Only the Mayans are mentioned although I thought the film portrayed the conflict between the Mayan's, and Aztecs prior to the European invasion as the culture clash is quite evident. A little slow starting, but give it a chance. And I really like a nice ending."
4,Another Mel Gibson Great,"Very focused on the main character, but amazing attention to detail on all the movie's periphery."
4,Dramatization of Mayan Decline,"Here you can see Gibson's vision of the Mayan kingdom as it faces its decline, the rulers insist the key to prosperity is to build more temples and offer human sacrifices. Jaguar Paw is a young man who is captured for sacrifice, but flees to avoid his fate. He is taken on a perilous journey to a world that is ruled by fear and oppression, where a harrowing end awaits him. Through a twist of fate and spurred by the power of his love for his woman and his family he will make a desperate break to return home and to ultimately save his way of life. Though the film has historical inaccuracies, it does show the behavior that caused its decline. This movie is fast paced, but be aware it has violent scenes."
5,one unusual story--but great!,this is a most unusual story--but a great one!keeps you glued to the tv-from beginning to the end--and the blu ray version is stunning!its a bit gory in parts but it is facinating to watch--highly enjoyable--and interesting to boot when you view the end--highly recommend
4,Deja vu IMO ......and very worthwhile,"Stellar production -- One of a few I will bother to purchase having caught it this week on TV. Not sure if credits mention or how many others have noted, but I saw some startling similarities between this and Gary Jennings' fabulous 1980 novel, ""Aztec."" Bottom line is regardless your feelings for Gibson, this is a great one to see. Very worthwhile."
4,"Very original, but not for the faint of heart","It's fast-paced, well-directed and truly is a good movie.However, it's not for everybody. Normally, I'm not too whiny about violence in movies. But Mel Gibson went hard-core in this one, much more than his other movies. It's understandable, because it's the story of survival that happens back in savage time. It makes me feel uneasy and pushing me forward at the same time. But I wouldn't watch it again.If you don't mind violence, go for it. It's a crude, barbaric action that comes in a fine piece of cinema.But if you can't take too much blood, violence, and tension, then it's not for you."
5,Mel Gibson did again.,"Feel like living in the Maya world, though fictional, story is touching and real, great on blu-ray format."
4,Take a Trip in a New World,"That Movie gives you a New Experience in watching a Movie. Soon this Move brings you to a never seen before World. Everything seems to be real as you watching the Movie. Sound and Picture are how Blu-Ray should be...Take the Trip....But beware, if you don't like Movie's in Original Language(Maya) with English Subtitel...but give this Movie a try"
1,"Please, someone, take Mel to the Yucatecan Jungle....","......strip him, paint him blue, cut his heart out, chop his head off, and save us all from any more of his stupid,loud, violent, bloody movies! I just wish there was 0 stars for this one - a complete waste of talent, time, effort, and money. Do youself a favor and skip this one - I sure wish I had!"
1,Mell is a chauvinist and sadistic pervert,"He obviously gets off on carnage. This pointless and grossly historically distorting, chauvinistic flick is another proof of it. I gave it one star for some beautiful scenery."
2,English Subtitles Suck,This could be a excellent movie if it was in english and not just english subtitles...Wake up mel enough is enough.
4,A GOOD HISTORICAL PIECE.,"While it's not on par with his last two directorial efforts (the epic ""Braveheart"" and the soul-stirring ""The Passion of the Christ""), Mel Gibson's ""Apocalypto"" is a well-made historical film set during the final days of the Mayan empire. The cast and crew do a fine job of bringing the world of the Mayan to life. While the second act of the film gets long after a while, the final hour of the movie is rousing and exciting. And the unexpected ending will leave everyone wide-eyed. Fans of Gibson's previous work will enjoy ""Apocalypto.""Movie/DVD Grade: B+"
5,Enjoy the ride and dont knit-pick the historical details!,"An Aztec civilization would have been a better backdrop for a historically accurate movie, but details aside, Mel created another masterpiece. This movie is more than just entertainment. It comes with a very thought-provoking message: Conquering nations will commit the most hideous crimes to remain in power and the cycle continues to repeat itself as weaker nations fall to the ones with the biggest and meanest guns. Fabulously breathtaking and totally awesome (and I mean the literal awe-inspiring kind!) This is one that I've added to my collection...JAX, author ofHeart of The JaguarA Shadow to Call Her OwnAmazon shorts""A Bridge to Freedom"" and ""Grandma's Recipe""Chicken Soup for the Latino Soul: Celebrating La Comunidad Latina[...]"
2,"Below standard, disappointing....","The pads came without a box, only 23 is in the shipment (2 missing), 1 has part of the pad protruding out of the package. No feedback from the company."
4,Be careful of the seller you use,I ordered these pads twice the first time frome BP medical they came beautifully wrapped in plastic perfect for storing away from high humidity second time from Direct Care came in open box no plastic just tossed in a shipping box that is my last order from them that is for sure. So forewarned is forearmed be careful with the supplier 5 stars to BP Medical 2 for Direct Care item of course is what it is as described
1,Items look used and abused,Items showed up unboxed and stuffed in a vanilla envelope.My guess is these were stolen from a hospital and resold.Doubt theyre very sterile now.Some of them look like they were wadded up.Amazon needs to pull this supplier from their network.
2,"thin ,thin, thin",very thin gauze. had to use two packs at each use. we went through these very quickly. my mom need to use gauze on a daily basis and these do not last. this gauze is good for minor to medium wounds not major.
2,EHH,"Don't let the box fool you, they don't come in one. And they counted 2 shy, not a big deal. And they don't exactly look like new production either."
3,Cheap and thin,These are not very thick and the weave is loose. They are not as good as some of the others I have ordered on Amazon. Still they are inexpensive and as they say - you get what you pay for...
3,They were ok,"its hard to buy something like this off line without really seeing and feeling it,so was a little disappointed in the quality,the size was ok still looking for the right thing."
5,Buy it in the store for $2.50,"Not sure why they're asking a total of $15 including shipping when you can buy it for $2.50 locally. It's a great product but still, online pricing shouldn't be exorbitant."
5,Great Hard Drive. Best Value Sweet Spot on the Market Today,"If you can find one of these for [a good price] per GB, snap it up. I'm running a Dell with Windows XP and adding this drive was a snap with Maxtor's setup disc. Comes with everything you need. Runs fast enough for video editing, and very quiet, too. I've added Maxtor drives to 4 different PCs and never had a moment's problem."
4,Works just fine.,"I use win XP.No problem in installation.No problem recognizing the volume.I really have no complaint about it, works just like it should. Use it mainly for backup and movie storage, so don't really care about how fast it is, but of course I try to go with 8mb and ATA133. $2/1GB would be a good price for this. Refered to amazon by WhoSave coom.Recommendation: get a external HD enclosure for your old hard drive, don't toss it out, just use it as a USB drive."
3,comp. bet. WD 40 GB vs. Maxtor 120GB,"Newly Installed Maxtor 120 GBpro: cheap, full kitcon: heavy spinning noisysame 7200 RPM"
1,Failed after 4 days,"This drive failed without warning after 4 days. I bought it on June 21st and it failed on June 24th. Windows tried to access the drive, which caused the machine to reboot. Upon reboot the BIOS did not recognize the drive and I could hear a 'click click' of the drive head. Save yourself the headache and don't get this product."
1,UTTER CRAP!,"I bought this 120Gb Maxtor drive, and less than six months after installation, had a complete disk failure. There's about 100Gb of data *poof* gone, just like that."
1,Maxtor is o.k. if...,"You don't use the drive for your operating system, backups or storing data. They make wonderful paperweights, but that is about it. The installation software is easy, if you don't have a problem with it and it doesn't trash your system. If you have trouble with the drive, don't worry. Maxtor will offer every kind of excuse possible, tech support is not helpful, and customer service needs to be renamed. Customer contempt, perhaps. Maybe customer disservice. Shop for a better drive and a better company."
2,Never again will I buy Maxtor,"I had been using Maxtor drives the past 5 or 6 years. Well let me rephrase - was using old Quantum Fireballs before Maxtor bought that company. So decided Maxtor would be my next purchase. I bought a 40 GB drive a while a go - it failed after about a year of use. So then I bought a 120 GB Maxtor drive. That thing died on me after 6 months, destroying a boat load of data that took me months to get bac (some I would never get back).The drive gets too hot, and is fairly noisy. One the other hand, I have recently been using a Hitachi/IBM drive and it has been rock solid.I will never buy another Maxtor drive."
