3,OK for the price,"Ok for the price. You get what you pay for. Skin is adequate for protecting the unit but the screen protector was a clear sticker, yes, a sticker you peel and stick onto the screen. Needless to say, that was easier said than done, air bubbles and finger marks are inevitable. The clip is so cheap and useless that it is actually funny. The armband and lanyard serves their purpose. As long as you know what you're getting and aren't expecting anything more, this is an OK buy."
4,great item for sansa,"This arrived early, thanks. Shipping is expencive though, one dollar for the cover and six dollars for shipping."
1,Never Received - received no refund which I could review.,"I wish I would of received this so I could tell what they were like. Unfortunately, I paid over $21.00 and received nothing. Just paid for 3 with high shipping on each and received nothing."
5,Protection for my tunes :),"I like protecting my toys. This one comes with a screen cover, writstband, tight fit case (no slipping.) Not to mention the arm band. Strong recommend."
2,Bad Belt Clip & Cheap Cover,"BE CAREFUL WITH COVER !! I thought I was and it tore as soon as I put it on. The belt clip, which I ALWAYS use is really cheap too. I was disapointed in it since I was so happy with MP3. The arm band seems to be good, but with cover so thin, I'm concerned that it will tear when I'm using it out running."
5,Pink Silicone Case for Sansa e250/e250r,"I bought this skin for my 4-year old daughter so she can watch her princess sing-a-longs and listen to Disney music. She LOVES it. It fits much better than expected (the pictures show the wheel being partially covered so I thought it would interfere, but it doesn't). She likes the pink color rather than the standard black, and I like the fact that I don't have to worry about the Sansa being covered in fingerprints and scratches :) All-in-all it's a great product."
4,Enjoyable product for children.,My kids enjoy Sesame Street & this video they liked. Has some old songs but updated so it does not diminish quality. The dvd-rom disk my kids liked as well & held their interest for an hour. The links to more games on the internet helped. It helped me teach my youngest to use a mouse for the 1st time. I give this product a favorable review.
3,So much for those links to online content,"Too bad Sesame Street seems to have taken down all their online game content (August 2008) So much for their educational mission! I guess some of it is available on these DVD/CD-ROM releases, but it sucks that low income families have to buy them instead of getting the content online, as they've been able to for the last few years. (T-Mom)"
4,Cute game,"I was looking for a game for my four year old. The game is fun, but there was definitely a learning curve. There were some parts where you have to make pretty specific timed jumps that were a little difficult for her. She definitely loves it and plays the first level over and over again. It's a great game to learn the controls."
4,Strawberry Shortcake Sweet Dreams PlayStation 2 Game,"I bought this game for my six year-old daughter. The graphics of this mostly side scrolling game, with some 3rd person flying portions, are much better than I expected. The game play is fairly simple. On the side scrolling portions you mostly move right or left and jump. Occasionally, you will have to do other things like use a watering can. The early stages of the game are simple enough for even a four-year to play. However, the higher stages can be challenging and frustrating for a six-year old. On the higher levels, my daughter regularly asks for help because they are too difficult for her. One negative aspect of the game is that at times it is difficult to see what you are doing because your view may be hindered.Although the game is difficult for her, my daughter really loves the game. It is one of her favorite games to play."
5,Strawberry Shortcake game,"This game is great for smaller children. My daughter is 6 and she can play this game all by herself. She really enjoys it. There are a couple parts of the game where she needs help, but that is it. This was a good buy for her."
3,REALY CUTE GAME FOR YOUNGER KIDS,We purchased this game for my daughter and she liked it. It is pretty simple and very cute. There isn't a lot to the game and it's easy enough that younger children can play it with ease.
3,"Very Cute, but harder than it needs to be","I bought this for my five year old daughter. This is a side scroller with 3D graphics. Because of this, the controls are not always intuitive - you really only have the choice of left or right even when it looks like the character is moving away and toward you on the screen. Also, even on the easiest setting, there are a number of near-split-second timed jumping and turning challenges that most five year olds are simply not going to be up to. She has fun playing it, but only if I'm right there beside her to help through the frequent difficult spots. If your child still loves Strawberry Shortcake at the age of 7 or so, this might not be a bad choice. I wouldn't get it for a younger child."
3,A really cute game for that adorable little girl at home!,My four year old neice loves this game an awful lot. She does seek my help at times for she is only four! Even though she gets frustrated she still enjoys it. I recommend this game for kids older than three though!
1,"Problem - ""Disk Read Error""","I ordered this game (and also Dora's Journey to the Purple Planet) for my 4 year old daughter and was very upset to discover that neither of these games could be played on my PS2 system - they both have the ""blue backing"". I called Sony and the guy said that some of the earlier PS2 systems could not read some the games that were formatted with the blue backing. He mentioned that these games were originally formatted to the original PS system. I was told that I would have to send my PS2 system to Sony and for $45 they would send me a refirbished unit within 7-10 days of receipt. All of our other games work fine so we decided to return the two video games and purchase something else. I wish the companies would indicate the ""blue backing"" or mention that some games might not work with all gaming system models (mine is the earlier model). Supposedly, with the later models, this isn't a problem. Anyway, I'm sure it is a cute game but I didn't get a chance to find out."
4,Strawberry Hit!,"My daughter is just in love with this game. She normally can not sit still for more than 30 minutes at a time and then has to move on to something else. Not the case with this game, she has been playing it for hours and just loves it."
4,Wonderful... 1 tbs makes 1/2 gallon of juice!,"Very pleased with this product... HOWEVER, gave it only 4 stars because the bottles I purchased on 1/14/2011 actually expired on 12/13/2010.... and I still am using one of them on 3/15/2011. If I order from this supplier again, I will ask for FRESH juice."
2,formerly great - now awful,"I will leave my original review on here but ask you to please also read my follow up in the ""comments"" section. This company no longer makes a good or healthy product and that is so very sad.Here is the original review:I agree with other folks who have reviewed this product that it seems too sweet to be ""just plain cranberries"", but since the manufacturer says it is pure, it is by far the best source of the daily dose of cranberry juice that some of us ""girls"" need to keep from getting recurring bladder infections. I have used it for almost 2 years and the quality is always consistent.I find the manufacturer's recommendation of 2 1/2 T concentrate to one glass of water is much too strong for my taste buds and this is true of all of their flavors. I use about half that amount. Still, I recommend all of the Dynamic Health concentrates. The sweeter ones, like blueberry, make fantastic natural, healthy pancake syrup."
4,SUCCESSFUL PURCHASE,"Pure cranberry juice concentrate can be difficult to find, and expensive to purchase.This product is well priced, good quality. I expect to buy again...."
2,Knitting and Healing,"I purchased this book because I was interested in what might be said about the healing aspects of needle arts. The book does give reference to the author's love of knitting & needlepoint, & shares some perspectives on how these arts may be stress reducing & meditative. However, there is far more content regarding the author's emotional & physical challenges than the writings I'd hoped for. It is, frankly, depressing. I have ordered Knitting Sutra, by the same author, in hopes that has more of the content I am seeking."
3,Triumph motorcycle engine strip & rebuild,"On first glance its a useful tool when stripping and rebuilding a triumph twin, with some really helpful observations. Wes White is quite laid back and though some of his comments are a little quirky (at least to my ears as an engineering Quality Inspector), he imparts a good knowledge of what he earns his living doing every day. If it prevents me from missing a simple task sush as placing a washer the wrong way around then it will be worth every penny.....talking of which..... on top of the high purchase price, add on a fiver for the VAT and EIGHT pounds for the Post Office 'Handling Fee'and the price suddenly rockets. As you can guess, the Post Office left a card so I had to go and pick it up from the Post Office in my local town and cough up the EIGHT quid in extortion money!Once bit....twice shy and I won't be buying any more stuff from the US via Amazon.com."
5,very helpful,"I thought this video was very helpful. I referred back to it several times while rebuilding my bonneville motor and transmission. regarding the first review, usually the very ""professional"" videos are done by actors who dont have a clue what they are even doing. Id rather watch this video put out by people who do this for a living day in and day out. And who really cares if the dialogue is adlibbed, he was tearing into an actual job he had at his shop. You cant rehearse for a job you havent started yet. Also if you need any parts or service wes and tyler both are people who you can actually talk to when you call their businesses. I dont know about anyone else but this means alot to me."
1,Anything will sell,"If one knows nothing about mechanical work on a motorcycle, ok this DVD might be better than nothing. In reality, it is filmed with the very worst equipment. It feels like an 8mm movie from 40 years ago. The lighting is way too dark, the shots are mostly out of focus and the camera is always at the wrong place and keep you from seeing much.I didn't learn a single thing. I value the efforts and I know the market for such a DVD is rather limited. But still, it is a complete waste of time and money."
4,DC Power Inverter,"Product allows you to use a 110V AC device in your vehicle. Internal cooling fan is quieter than others & keeps it from overheating. The extra DC socket is a plus by giving you the ability to plug in another 12 volt device which the inverter initially took up. I would have given it five stars if it weren't for the fact that it requires an almost flush vehicle socket to work without a 12 volt extension cord. If your vehicle socket is recessed like mine, you will have to use the extension cord."
4,"Helpful, but could have been better","Excellent guide. No question. The only flaw (reason for 4 stars and not 5) is the secret tokens. The guide writer isn't very specific on the token locations. (I.E. behind the building by the trash can).....Where? There are SEVERAL of those locations. Other than that, very helpful on the challenges (tells you tips on how to improve) and missions. a Good buy (not excellent because of the secret token descriptions)"
2,"Nice pack, not idea for me","The pack itself was very nice and had quite a bit of pockets if you needed to separate you items. I sent this item back in the end because it didn't sit flush against my back, no matter how tight I pulled it on my waist."
1,Guidebook full of incorrect and out of date information,"Having had quite a lot of previous Walt Disney World experience, I was really disappointed with this book. I will say that the book looks nice and is laid out all right, but the content is awful. The book mentions attractions and shows that were long gone (I mean years) by it's release date in late 1998. One of Disney's major resort hotels isn't even named properly in the book. There is a big difference between Coronado Springs (correct) and Colorado Springs (wrong). Anyone who has even briefly visited the hotel can pick up on the southwest/Mayan/Aztec theme and should realize that the name Colorado Springs wouldn't make sense. I think if an author is claiming to be enough of an expert on something to write a guidebook, the basic facts should be right, which they are not. Virtually any other guidebook will give you better and more relevant information!"
1,"A commercial for Walt Disney World, that won't tell you all","Having my hotel constantly misspelled was my first clue that this book would be less than helpful. You buy a book like this know what to avoid as much as what to see. I can read the promomotional brochures myself. Tips like: The ET ride at Universal Studios isn't worth a 20 minute wait much less 90 minutes. Or, the Lagoon a the Coronado Springs (Not Colorado) is beautiful, but you'll spend your entire trip walking around it to get to the pool. Something a little more critical is required for vacationeers going to such a expensive place. This book does little service for vacation planners."
2,There must be better books,"I was looking for a book that covered both Disney World and Universal. I visited DW in 1996 and wanted information about new stuff. I picked up the book at a Brick and Morder B&N and thought it seemed like the best choice.It's not bad for a 1st time vister. But there are so many holes in the information. I used the web links that were mention in the first chapter like http://www.wdwinfo.com/ which has more info then the book.They just say ""Disney will have a 15 month Millenium Celiberation"" no more info about it! That's what I wanted to know. I'm on Amazon today to order a better Disney World book. A good update and a better editor would make this an awsome buy. Big book for under $13, but no pictures like the offical guide and not a lot of inside information. Plus they didn't update for the millenium celibration. Or Islands of adventure in Universal. Just said there there was going to be one."
5,fast and fun romance!,"This is from the book's write-up: He'll have to wed her to bed her? The moment hot-blooded tycoon Jace Dimitriades met Rebekah, the attraction sparked between them. Jace knows that women find him irresistible---and Rebekah's no exception. So how come all he's getting from her is the cold shoulder? Rebekah finds Jace extremely sexy...but that's the problem! She can't give in to her feelings for him without giving Jace a hold on her heart---and it's been bruised before. Jace is determined to show Rebekah that he's different, but it seems the only way to play his ace---is to propose...."
5,Drop what you're reading and go find a copy of this book!,"My favorite of Perry's books, this non-stop tale of Chinese Gordon and his confederates kept me laughing and left me awestruck. I cannot believe no one has made a movie yet of this book! How often do you get to pull for the bad guys and hate the good guys, and laugh about it the whole time? What I particularly like about Perry's work is that he never finds it necessary to reveal every detail of a character's history, only what is needed to make the plot tick along. Inevitably, his characters remain in my mind long after I've finished the book, musing over how Chinese got his name (his name is Leroy), why his cat is named Dr. Henry Metzger, and how did he meet his girlfriend who is the PERFECT girlfriend for a former mercenary. Questions only Mr. Perry has the answer to, and I hope someday to encounter Chinese in print once again -- so I can ask some new questions!"
5,The Best of Thomas Perry,"I have my original copy of this novel, and re-read it every few years. It is the best he has written. Funny (very), and what a plot. Do not miss this read. You will thank me."
3,Metzger's Dog: A Novel..... Bow Wow!,"Metzger's Dog: A NovelIf your love reading novels, as I do....I wouldn't give this to a friend. Novels take TIME from your life. Make sure it's worth it. This book has an amusing concept and sales pitch but you can have mine for $0.00."
2,Just couldn't get into it,"I ordered this book in part because of all the positive reviews. I really wanted to enjoy the story, but I just could not get into the book. I'm not really sure why - I would be hard pressed to say anything negative about the book, it just was not for me."
2,"Mildly interesting, cartoonish rather than realistic","I don't have a lot of patience with slow starts. I got through page 84 of the book's 314 pages before deciding it just wasn't going to be worth my while. I understand it's intended to be funny, but I still expect life-like characters that I can recognize as real people in some sense. These characters just seemed too much like cartoon characters. And then the mythically-vicious 200-pound dog who can practically destroy a horse-trailer is introduced -- and he's instantly tamed by a cat who is reminiscent of the Siamese cats in the Disney movie Lady and the Tramp. That was the point where my credibility was stretched beyond its limits and I decided it was time to start a different book."
4,Hoping for more,"There was a lot of good things in the book from a layman's perspective. I would have liked to see more quotes from the early church ""fathers"" especially the disciples of the disciples."
5,circus,"Farrell & Morrow have created a rich, imaginary circus that puts all our preconceptions and interpretations of life (especially college) on stage. UPF turns many of the beliefs we live by mindlessly into elephant men, the fat lady, and half-cocked clarivoyant gypsies for us to ridicule and humiliate. Challenging topics as serious as racism, aneorexia, homosexuality or human disconnectedness is not easy but the book is brilliant in bringing them to the audience dressed in disguise, which makes us think differently about them.My favorite aspect is the way they pull the blanket off of marketing schemes. Every transaction we make using the Dollar is riddled with business and capitalist strategies; paying tuition is no exception!"
5,I Laughed So HARD it hurt!,"I heard about UPF from a friend's recommendation, and have to say this book is hilarious! It's sharp, biting, dark, and laugh-out-loud funny. My friends and I read sections out loud to one another and it is such a great time. The authors manage to lampoon so many aspects of college life and American culture and they are SO right on about their observations. It's easy to read and can be read in any order since it's all written in short sections; the scholarships and clubs are my favorite and there are 100s of them. Really, I haven't enjoyed a book this much in a long time. Very unique new idea."
2,Not what I expected!,"This HD radio is not what I expected at all. The reception is terrible even with the antennas that were included. I've had a chance to hear other HD radios and this one is very below standards. After 6 months use, my remote has buttons that no longer work. I'd return it but it's not worth the trouble. Live and learn. I give it a rare, ""DON'T BUY THIS ITEM""!"
4,i don't see why folks couldn't follow the plot,"certainly there were times when you might lose a thread, but i don't get why people didn't think the plot came together. i find his style a little austerish (paul), in that psuedo-mystery sort of way. after su tong he's now my second favorite chinese writer........."
2,Don't Believe the Hype,"I read some of the hype about this book and picked it up at the library-wish I hadn't. It resulted in possibly the most annoying few hours I've ever spent reading. Make no mistake, I enjoy good surrealism (Gogol for one) and noir (Chandler, et al), and I am reasonably well steeped in Asian pop culture, but this was a total disappointment. It starts confusingly, but I figured things would gradually clear up as I read along, however by the end I was no further along in understanding the book. The aimless plot clearly is meant as a portrait and critique of modern urban Chinese society, with it's attendant cynical wheeler-dealer underworld figures, but that's about it. Stephen King bafflingly blurbed it as ""the most brilliantly entertaining hardboiled novel of the 90s."" It might actually work better as film, perhaps in the hands of a master of atmosphere and mood like Wong Kar Wai."
4,norman mailer meets paul auster?,"despite early plot similarities to mailer's tough guys don't dance it does go elsewhere. it also has auster's psuedo mystery genre thing going, and even feels a little austeresque. makes me think i'm gonna like the new china...."
5,Excellent Travel System,"I purchased this travel system and was a little leary because I thought ""How could a really good travel system not even cost $200?"" Boy was I wrong! The stroller is very easy to stear, and it's tall so that my husband isn't hunched over to push it. We looked into the Quattro Tour stroller and travel system, and I didn't see the differance other than the price tag."
3,Decent product,"The EvenFlo travel systems are quality products. I find one huge design flaw, though. When you stop using the infant carrier and place the child in the regular stroller seat the velcro used to position the back of the seat does not hold leaving the child to have to lean back too far rather than sit up. I have not find a way to remedy this."
3,Will work but definitely not the best,With my first son I choose Even Flow products just for the look but then realized they are not the best quality. I ended up purchasing a GRACO travel system after I found the evenflow system to be so annoying and hard to work with. Just to move the handle is a pain and you have to push down on the entire seat to move it witch usually ended up waking up the baby.... After talking to people at the store I learned EvenFlow products are not favored. I wouldn't recommend evenflow unless it was a back up system or something.
2,Safety concern,"The base part of the car seat keeps collapsing. There are 3 levels to choose from to make it the right angle in your particular vehicle, mine needs to be on level 3, but when I tighten it down it goes back down to level 1. If I do happen to get it to stick on 3, by the time I get where I'm going and take my daughter out, it's back down on 1 again. This makes the base too loose and makes baby tilt too far forward.The stroller is okay, had no trouble with the one-handed fold down. But the seat reclines back too far and she can't sit all the way up, she gets frustrated easily (7 1/2 months) by this because she likes to look around and can't because of the semi-recline position she has to be in. The cup holders are nice and so is the large storage area. Kinda hard to steer though.I wouldn't buy this one again!"
1,DON'T BUY THIS SYSTEM,"This travel system is horrible!Not only is the base and infant carrier designed to sit too upright with little recline, the infant carrier is cheap and wears down over time.The locking mechanism on the handle completely broke within 5 months and the stroller is too big and awkward and hard to fold down.Don't waste your money on this cheap, poorly made system!"
2,the rear tire broke,"i am very disappointed with this travel system. i only have used it for 3 months, and the rear tire broke as i was using it. my baby is on it when it happened.(what a scare) he only weighs less than 13 lbs and i just placed a diaper bag on the cargo net. i was just pushing it around normally, how could it break????i do not think it is a safe travel system to use considering what happened to the tire without warning."
3,great stroller car seat base sucks,We tried out a bunch of Travel systems at the store before deciding on this one.The Things I Like1.I love the handle on the car seat it's easy to carry on your arm and isn't uncomfortable2. the straps are easy to ajust in the seat (my husband had a hard time with it but that's because he didn't read the instrctions)3. the stroller drives very smoothly and turns niclyThings I don't like1. The car seat base is almost imposiable to install on my leather seats (honda accord) I had to buy addtional bases for my husbands car my mom and my baby sitter which made this system alot more expensive.2. At frist I had a really hard time getting the stroller to fold down3.The sunvisor on the car seat is always falling under the seat and I can't figure out a way to remove itI do like this car seat and will use an evenflo with my second child since I already own 5 bases for the car seat
2,Please Read before you buy,I have many Even Flo products and have actually been a fan. Until I bought the Embrace 5 Travel System (similar to the Aura). First of all the infant carrier started to show white stress marks in the gray handle before my son reached 15 lbs. It also tends to sit a bit upright in the car. Secondly the Stroller! If you have more than 9 lbs in it the wheels get stuck due to poor design. When I called the company to ask what to do. They said it wasn't a safety issue. I nearly knocked over the stroller several times while trying to walk on a sidewalk. The wheels get stuck and comes to a complete stop or goes to the side. I am very disappointed in Even Flo. BEWARE BEFORE YOU EVEN FLO INFANT CARRIES OR TRAVEL SYSTEMS. Please make sure you put at least 20 lbs of weight in a stroller and push it around before you buy. I wouldn't give mine away its going in the trash.
4,Durable and Fun,"This toy is durable, sturdy and fun. I like it because it makes noise, but not annoying electronic sounds or electronic loud music. Baby makes noise the old fashioned way, by actually moving the toy around or shaking the toy him/herself. It also makes a great teether on the handle side, which is thick ridged plastic. A great stroller toy."
4,Daddy did good,"Well I gave my husband a lot of slack for getting this toy. when I saw what he got I thought he had spent $20 (including shipping) on a glorified rattle. Well it came an it was an instant hit. My daughter played with this for 45 min. I am lucky if she play with a toy over 10 min. It is really neat that you can lock them together, or have them seperate. This toy is very durable, solid bright colors and will surely entertain you child. She is 7 months now and she still goes for this everyday. I think she will continue to enjoy it as she gets older. The price is a bit high if you figure in shipping. That is why i gave it a 4, but if I new how much my child would like this I would by it all over again."
4,The sound of music,The sound quality is pretty good. I was disappointed that the earphones didn't fit in my mp3 player... The disadvantage is that they don't stay comfortably in your ears.
2,Sounds kind of tinny,"The sound quality is pretty thin and tinny on these, but not bad for the price, I guess."
5,poor psp ear buds,The ear buds do not work properly you have to put the volume in the middle so you can hear anything.
5,thank you maskman,"It is so funny, you laugh until you cry. It is a must to hear and see Lenny Bruce's Thank you maskman"
1,MISSING VIDEO,"I -ONLY- bought this CD because of the promised video of ""Thank You Maked Man"". This is NOT the ""enhanced version"" as promised. The Thank You Masked Man [CD-ROM Track] is missing from the disc."
3,Close but no cigar,"I was sadly mistaken when I assumed that this venture would be the same style of music as Polydistortion. It's like GG had some sort of secret midnight meetings in the ealy 80's garden with Til Tuesday ( no offense Ms.Mann ) over the last 3 years. The title sums it up, This is normal?"
2,"really wanted to like this, but...","after hearing tracks of theirs on the 'northern exposure' mix cd's i decided to buy this album. sorry, but it just didn't connect with me. there's only a few remotely stand-out tracks, and even they can't lift what for me was a big dissapointment."
3,"What is the capitol of Iceland, Alex?","I only know of two bands from Iceland. The other one isSigur Ros. I can't say how I like them compared to Gus Gus,as I've been avoiding them, even though I keep hearing howgreat they are.Then I remembered Gus Gus, and how this cd was virtually apermanent part of my car for the better part of a month.Parking brake off, no cars coming, Gus Gus playing, now we can go.The quality of This Is Normal could inspire me to buy an albumwith an alienfetusangel on the cover. That's the highest praise I can give."
2,Be careful.,"I LOVE the song ""Ladyshave."" So, I buy the album expecting several more tracks similar to ""Ladyshave."" However, there were none. This album is well produced, and if you like this kind of music--it has some good songs. It has some cool moments. But don't buy it just because you like ""Ladyshave."" Just get the single."
2,Flawed...,"This CD comes across as so 'light' that it never really seems to register. It's like the tracks are always on the verge of turning into big dancefloor stompers yet they never tip the scales. 'Believe' was a great track featured on the Northern Exposure II compelation, I expected to find more of the same on this album but unfortunatly I was sorely disapointed. Credit should be due for the range of styles that they've drawn on, if only they could have blended them together a bit smoother. Unfortunatly the craks show. Other people's cup of tea perhaps, but not mine, sorry!"
5,Great CD,"Gus Gus have matured and produced an even better CD compared to the their first one, PolyDistortion. They are fantastic live, I saw them in Chicago on May 9, 1999, and I danced and danced, something I normally do not do. I guess that's Normal nowadays."
2,Too normal,"Although the group is full of good ideas they lack the skill to turn them into good music. So in the end it's just normal dance music that you can listen to at a party or while you do your housework but you will soon forget it and start dancing to something else. But that's the problem with almost all pop music today. On the other hand, some artist manage to rise above all that and become unique, I'm afraid that gus gus doesn't have what it takes."
5,Gus Gus has a kind of music to call their own,"I don't have the CD This Is Normal yet, but I recently heard Teenage Sensation - and I loved it. Their sound is different and one that draws you in into the meaning of the song. I was impressed, and I'm buying the CD as soon as I can."
5,PARROT KABOB TOY,"This is a good parrot toy. I have an African Grey who thought this toy was interesting and worthy of chewing apart a bit at a time and not all at once. She likes the bell too! But I thought I was buying a smaller version of this toy that I had purchased some years ago for my Love birds. This is too big for my Love birds. It is perfect for an African Grey or similar parrot.. I am still in search of the smaller version for my love birds.. Same toy, same manufacturer but a lot smaller. Reni"
5,So cute!,"I ordered this tote because I wanted something different. It's very bright, very floral, perfect for summer. It is a bit larger than I thought, but that's okay. It has a pretty blue lining. The strap length allows you to carry it over your shoulder."
2,HUGE purse,"This purse was huge. I like big.. but this was a little too big. Also, the sections in the picture that look like leather are actually a copper metallic. But the print was really cute."
4,Nice Mirror,"This mirror was just the size that I was looking for. I removed the clamp (it has 2 screws holding it on) and mounted it by drilling and tapping 2 holes in the metal frame around the windshield. Then I just threaded the 2 screws that were holding on the clamp into my 2 new holes and it looks like it was meant to be there. The only flaw is the limited amount of adjustability it has, but with a little modification ( I grinded down the base to allow more motion in 1 direction) it worked out just fine."
1,"Booooooo, this movie was BAD!",This was a Horrable movie...it draged out seeming like it was 10 hours long..i would not buy this movie
3,"Good voice, mediocre CD","This is the second album of Judith Lefeber who has her fame from the German Popidol show....she proved to be a good singer often enough....but here she gives us an album full of cover songs....after this album she went to sing in the musical AIDA. Probably she was not so happy about the way her popmusic career turned. It's an ok buy for a fan, but in the end as a music fan you have all these songs sung a dozen times by other singers already."
1,Rino 530 does not work!!!,"I purchased my Garmin Rino 530 in March '06 hoping to use it on my spring turkey hunts. When using the radio the screen would go blank and I would have to remove the battery to get it to work again. I called Garmin and they exchanged it for a new unit. Again the new 530 screen would become corrupt and the go blank while talking on the radio. I sent this one back and the sent me a new one. Now on unit number 3, guess what it does... screen become corrupt then goes blank while talking on the radio!!! Each time I sent a unit back they claim it is performing as it is supposed to. I'm at a loss what to do. My Rino 110 works well.UPDATE: I finally got a functional unit on my fourth try, but now the radio only transmits static. The microphone does not work! I can only transmit with my push to talk plug in devise. I have 9 friends I hunt with and 3 of us have the same problem. Back to Garmin it goes..."
2,"Great GPS, awful radio.","I purchased the 530 after finding out that a new firmware edition had come out. The GPS was working fine. The screen didn't blank out when using the radio. However, when I was using my radio to communicate with a Rino520, the voice transmission from my radio was garbled and had a lot of background noise. I verified the channel codes, even turned off the ""scramble"" mode and the radio still did not transmit properly. I could hear fine from my 530, I just couldn't communicate out from it.From the problems I've read about, it seems like Garmin still needs to work out some bugs and get quality control issues resolved."
2,GPS Rino 530,Received two from Amazon. First one had to be sent back as it was dysfunctional. The second one I received to replace the first one is also defective. The battery is to big and will not completely seal.
4,worked great for me,"worked great for me , although you have to reset the display brightness every time you turn the unit off,"
4,BOMB item,My husband used this so much when he went hiing in Yosemite. He loved it. Very durable and reliable. Battery lasted a fair amount of time aswell.
1,"Guys, Don't BUY this","Don't regret not reading the above bad reviews on this product.All of is true. The lockup's the high price, it all adds up to DON'T BUY THIS, it's not ready for prime time."
1,Buy a cellphone...,"[...] My sister and I thought we would be able to Instant message using these across the neighborhood. So we split up, loading the ""chips"". To our displeasure, we had to walk all the way back, switch ""chips"" and put them in.This is not a very good toy. First, you have to annoyingly scroll through each letter. For example, to type in a y, you have to press the select button 25 times and enter it, so messages take AT LEAST 5 minutes.Then you have to physically HAND these little chips to your friends. It would be 100x easier just to talk to them. There are a ton of little gadgets like these, but this has to be one of the worst.You are better off just talking or buying another toy of this nature, as nobody wants to walk, switch ""chips"" and walk away."
3,Should i get it?,Well.....i'm 13 and my little sister wants one of these things and she's 10 but i think it's gay but i wanted to know should i buy this i mean $20 isn't alot i think it's cheap but i also looks cheap....HELP...well i think i probably is a waste of money and is really stupid but i think that it's cool that you can type in a message and give it to ur friend like IM or something soo
2,hard to use,i got this toy in febuary from my aunt.it is very hard to save messages.it takes alot of time to get use to it.i still have not yet.it is also hard to learn what all the buttons mean.on tv it looks so easy but its not.i recamend this toy for people who will take alot of time to figur this toy out. to me its very confusing.
2,It is POINTLESS,"When my friend got the toy I was expecting something else. I thought that you could write a message and it will go to the friend ,But I was wrong. I found out that In order to send the message you have to give your friend your chip (so you if your friend is sitting across the room I guess you have to throw it to her) I also think it's stupid because if you use it at school the teacher might not know what it is but they will know you are not paying attention so they will obviously take it away from you and if they find out what it's for you will get in huuuuuuuuuuuuuge trouble and the friendchip might be banned from the school. Also what if your friend is out of town what are you supposed to do throw it and hope it reaches her? So all I'm trying to say is that it is pointless."
5,So cool!,"This is a very cool toy! I love it. Maybe not useing it at school but with your friend , at your house , or outside it is very cool. It is worth 20 dollars! Buy it!"
3,ok toy....could be better,i think that this is a great toy.....but i think that you shouldnt have to have chips....make it better and should be like text messaging.....i think kids would like that better
2,Totally unusable,"First of all, this is more seeable than notes themselves, and it cots a lot more money. Lets say, you have one in class. What a dumb thing to do. Toss the device which could break in the process of being seen, and whats the point of it anyway? If you want to tell your friend something, do it in a more private place where you can't be heard. Then the teacher could take it away from you, and thats $20.00 down the drain. You, my friend, don't have to waste your money. Just don't buy this toy."
3,?,"This looks like a really cool toy but does it fit in your pocket? Can you write your own messages and transport them on those little chips then pass them? And my last question, is it worth $20.00?"
1,Question,"Hey! I don't have the FriendChips, but I'm trying to understand it and see if I want it. So, it comes with two of the actual things you type messages on, right? And 4 chips.Way #1. So, you type a message on--I'm going to call the things you type on computers--a mini computer, and in order for your friend to see the message, they have to have the other computer, right? So, you type the message and stick the chip in the computer that you are typing on.. then, are you supposed to give that chip to your friend, so when she plugs it into her computer she can see the message?Way #2. Or would it work for you to give your friend a different chip before class, and then you can write the message on a different chip. Would it still get to her?I'm just trying to figure this thing out and decide whether or not I want it. If anyone would let me know, I'd be very grateful! Thanks!"
3,Is it worth it?,"I don't have a friend chip set, but i think it's kinda neat. But I want ot know is it worth 20$? Well first of all if the teacher isn't blind they can easily see you with the friend chip machine thing typing something, where as with a pencil and paper they think ur doing the assignment. And how do u get the chip to ur friend, throw it across the room? My second thing is that I'm prolly gonna get a cell phone with text messaging in a couple years, so is it worth spending that much money on for a few years? Also, what if I want to send a note to a friend who dosen't have the other friend chip thing?And the last thing is what if the teacher sees, they are definatly gonna confinskate (i totally spelt that wrong) it and then the school will turn it into a rule that no one can have one!!!!!!!!!~*~ is it worth it?~*~"
1,Negative Educational Value?,"Friendchips is an example of a consumer play product whose useful life can only occur within the walls of a school and during hours that are supposed to be set aside for academics ... where else would an 8-12 year old girl find herself in a population sufficient to create the aura of ""fun"" for this item to be viable?[...]"
5,ExcellentPurchase,"Picture quality is amazing clean and crisp. Voice acting on the English dubs is perfect. If you are a fan of the Galaxy Express story or classic anime in general you will not be disappointed - I highly recommend this film. This re-mastered version is truly exceptional, not any extra's really but the audio and video quality could not be better."
2,Galaxy Express 999 Adue,"All anime put on DVD needs to be in the format as it was offered in VHS format. Namely DUB. & SUB., with the SAME VOICE ACTORS and THE SAME SCRIPT OFFERED IN VHS FORMAT!!! VHS gets 5 stars from me, DVD gets 2 stars because to is only SUB. ONLY."
1,WTF? This doesnt deserve to be on dvd!! true rating -10,"I will keep this short. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,TIME, OR BRAINCELLS. The most senseless film ever created"
5,Timeless tunes bring back memories,"I was so blessed to attend this Promise Keepers event in Boulder, Colorado. The sound quality is excellent and the praise of Jesus Christ comes through loud and clear. The excerpts from some of the conference speakers are a nice touch and remind me years after the fact of how great God is!"
2,not as good as I thought,"Unfortunately I am very disappointed in the swing seat I bought for my 3 year old son. Since it only has one string (it is actually more like a string than a rope) holding the seat, it is really unstable and my son has a hard time swinging. I have to push him since he is not that advanced yet to doing it on his own and therefore the whole thing always goes crooked or he leans too much backwards or forwards which is not his fault, it is just really hard to balancethe swing seat on one string. Therefore, I don't think that I would buy that swing seat again. Next time I will buy one that has for sure two ropes holding on to it."
1,Dangerous and unstable,"This swing is poorly designed. A single rope runs under the center of the swing creating an unbalanced seat. My athletic 5 year old grandson flipped out of it backwards and landed on my concrete porch, scraping skin off his back. He could have cracked his head open. I've taken it down and am looking for a more traditional design with support in the front and back edge of the seat."
5,ideal upgrade from the baby swing,this is just lovely. it's the absolute perfectly logical transition from the strap in baby/toddler swing. I chose these for my kids specifically for two reasons. First I know and trust the brand so much. And also I wanted a flat/straight seat for my son and daughter to sit them up better and encourage them learning to pump on their own
5,Sisterhood,"Although my sister had died before I read Dear Sister, Once Abused, I gained necessary insight into her challenges with childhood sexual abuse. This was the best book I could have read on this subject for my situation. There were many similarities. This book has helped me and I will pass it on to others."""
5,First experience,This album came out when I was bout 15/16 years old. Side one of this cd is incredible. I still love it after all these years (I'm 35 now)and have good memories everytime I hear it. It needs to be rated better than 5.
5,Too Bad I can't rate this more than five stars,The first side of this album is tight!!! I still enjoy it after so many years. This is a romantic masterpiece and a must buy album.
2,It is not like new.,"There are some highlights and notes with pen on it.The book is acceptable, but I think its quality is just good not like new!"
5,Perfect!,"My 6 year old grandson and I were discussing bears one day, and I realized we needed a book about bears. After reading reviews on several books about bears, I chose this book. This book is perfect to answer all the questions that kids have about bears. It includes sections about different kinds of bears, where bears live, how they are born and the amazing fact that newborn bears are the size of a newborn kitten, also where they grow and live, and many more. While the book focuses on bears of North America it also includes photos of bears from other parts of the world, some of which we had never seen.We highly recommended this book, and are looking forward to reading more books from the Kids Can Press Wildlife Series."
2,An enumeration of Patterns with no insight,"This book is based on archeological finds and modern works. There is nothing about symbolism or religion or worldview related to the embroideries. Mostly black and white charts, with some discussion of stitching technique."
4,love it!!,"ahhhhhh this is a great album, very indie and fun to listen to. Jeremy knows how to write some really good songs and melodies."
5,an appetizer with dessert,"not a great offering but a very good period sampler worth the price of admission for ""up to me"" and ""abandoned love"""
5,Great Dylan collection,"With a song archive as large and incredible as Dylan's, it is impossible for one to release an authoritative 'Greatest Hits' collection on one disc, let alone three. Yet this box set seems to pull it off quite effectively. It starts from the beginning and covers up to the mid-80s. The selection of songs effective illustrate Dylan's development and changes (good and bad) as a musician and songwriter. Some may find this set to be expensive, but it is an essential for even the casual Dylan fan. Alternate takes and live tracks make this a set worthwhile for the fan who has many Dylan CDs. Some key tracks may have been left off, but any attempt to make a collection like this for an artist as great as Dylan will not be perfect."
4,Comprehensive introduction to Dylan,"The greatest compliment ever paid to Bob Dylan was by George Harrison, who said he thought that Dylan's music would outlast that of the Beatles. You may not agree, but there's perhaps no better starting point for understanding Dylan. More comprehensive than the 'Greatest Hits' compilations. Fifty-odd songs for less than fifty bucks sounds a pretty good deal to me."
5,The Only Pet Door to Purchase,The Magnadoor is the only pet door to purchase which does a great job of closing after the pet uses the door. It will stay closed unless you get an awfully strong wind. It is the best product to keep out flies and other pests. Plus you can lock it when you are on vacation. Many of the other doors just have a soft floppy door which doesn't really close and keep out bugs.
2,REA not up to par.,"The problem with this book is relevance. The practice problems are not entirely reflective of the actual questions on the exam. If you wish to practice chemistry, than this book is fine; however, if you are preparing for the GRE Chemistry exam, then you will be sorely disappointed when you actually take the real exam, because the questions that you have been practicing on are sometimes not relevant. I believe that the publishers have republished corrected problems every few years, but have not recently touched base with actual problems from the real exam. Because of this, the questions seem to be outdated."
2,"Useful practice, but lots of errors","I bought this book for practising real GRE chemistry tests and wasn't disappointed by the test material it contains.Unfortunately, several solutions are simply wrong. Additionally, the book contains lots of typographical errors that make it hard to select the correct answer choice. Chemical formulas are often written incorrectly, too.For example, one question asked about the REAL gas law, while the solution dealt with the IDEAL gas law. Sometimes the explanations do not even match with the possible answer choices.The book is recommendable if you intend to practice for the test without paying the money for ETS' book, but you must be aware of the fact that a discrepance between your solution and the ""correct"" answer choice doesn't necessarily mean you're wrong."
2,published in 1988.,"Just so everyone is clear, this book was published in 1988...this information is not included in the product details. upsetting."
1,very old,The recent book must be good but the book that was sent to me was from 1980!! The exam must have changed in the last 30 years!
3,Questions out-dated,I purchased this book two years ago to study for my GRE test. It is only good if you already know the material very well and only use it for a review. It is a poor representation of what the actual GRE exam is.
3,"Pretty good selection of songs, pretty bad recording","Like somebody else indicated the recording it a mixed bag, some sound good some other not so much, normally all of his recordings are great, while the content selection on this one its a lot better than the regular as this are typical mexican songs, the way the record was done leaves so much to desire, my rating its mostly due to the selection of the songs rather than on the way they were recorded"
3,"Like the seat; however, be aware...","The seat is first class and made very well for those who need a big seat. However, beware that you just may have to buy a seat/post bracket, if the one you have will not fit. Mine did not. I called the company as was told that I would have to buy one especially for the seat. The company did not offer the bracket. No answer as to why the special bracket was not included, especially for the price of $59.99. So, eventually I had to take the seat to a bicycle shop. The seat/post clamp was not a standard size and it had to be ordered. Now, another week or so wait before I can use the very expensive seat. What about attention to customer service? I don't think so. I wish you luck in finding the seat/post clamp."
4,reasonably comfortable,"For my size (6'1', 260lb) it is more comfortable than other seats I tried. I do not take long bike trips (about 3 miles at a time), but with other seats I felt greater discomfort during and after biking. It is not something I would call a dramatic change though."
3,Disappointing,"I received the bicycle saddle in the mail and was very excited. I opened the package and the product was what I expected. Went to exchange my old seat for this new one and to my suprise there wasn't a place to attach the main bike stem too. The bicycle saddle, on the bottom, doesn't have the right fittings for my bike. I thought all bike seats were the same. Wrong!! Shipping the seat back to company was a nightmare. I am still waiting for my refund.Over View: Product was good. Just make sure it is the right seat for your bike. All bike seats are not the same. If you have to return the item for any reason remember returning this item and getting a refund could take several (I'm still waiting) weeks."
4,3 1/2 if i could,"I think everyone including the Pythons themselves, know that much of this movie, isn't nowhere as good as much of their other work. By the eighties, they really weren't as funny. After writing years of superb funny material, they came out with this.This is the soundtrack. Every man in America would like a certain part end the end, but that's not on this, as it's ""visual"". They might as well have realesed a soundtrack album, as they realesed evrything else on book soundtrack, and computer games. However the book version of ""Life of Brian"", was quiet esential, as the scrapboook version has ALOT of new material, writen but not used for that film.There isn't anything too new. The ""new material"" is the briefest parts by Micheal Palin, doing brief links, as on Final Rip-off, neither are very funny. Well I bought this for a fin at half.com, and it's too much here. This isn't essential, if you can pick it up for under 3 dollars, you might as well buy it."
3,A soundtrack - often a problem,"Since there are not so many songs in the film, there's a lot of dialog,and it works only partly without the visual...Well, ""Every Sperm is Sacred"" and ""Galaxy Song"" are still among my favorite Python songs..."
5,'Atsa! Bella senza trucco!,"Middle-aged guy hates his dull musician career, hooks up with foxy young girl, they quickly take off with success, then he loses girl to the very success he built up for them. There's so many funny characters and a great back-story in this traditional tragic comedy. I'd be disappointed if it was dubbed. The Italian-Belgian-French-English dialogue (w/ English subtitles) is part of this film's character. Yes, the euro-techno-pop music that gets them their success makes the ""success"" part a little far-fetched, but pretend it was really awesome and go with the story. (The end title song is pretty memorable though, both versions. And that ""Nervous"" song gets stuck in your head, regrettably.) A good film overall. Well worth it if you're into foreign comedies at all, you won't be disappointed."
1,Soft as playdough!,These were cheaper than the dealer so I went with them. But these things are so soft. They have to be made out of the cheapest metal possible. Don't bother with these softies.
5,Great headphones,Same style as my Rio headphones that died. I love the ear hook design and the added bonus of a volume control makes them even better.
1,maybe just a great way to throw away $10,"Very similar to a product I bought without the volume control.Negative stars.Similar 'products' are sold under different generic brands. All boast about 'driver size'. I bought pair at Fred Meyer like an idiot.There was nothing good or even adequate about them. The sound was atrocious. Antique earbuds from 1979 were about the same. Despite the hook, they did not stay in place for me and were not comfortable. The vinyl jacket wire was stiff and actually cracked! The hooks constantly came apart. The ear foam was crap. The old Jensen Audio company is long gone. It's just a cheap import brand now. Now I think the 'bigger' the driver, the worse the sound. Not surprisingly, they looked cheap when wearing them, too.Better to get some good earhooks from a quality brand for a little more, or good silicon gasketed earbuds, like Philips. Good earbuds fit like an earplug."
3,"OK...but,","For the price, it's functioning pretty good in terms of sounds. The design is not so much. Its Lightweight hook is too light that it doesn't stay put, which pretty much useless as a hook. Might as well choose something without a hook. The volume control is pretty cool..though at first doesn't look too convincing. All in all, OK for the price, but don't expect something special when you see ""Lightweight"" coz for me it's more a flaw than an advantage."
2,Not that good,"These headphones look great but I found them to be very uncomfortable, I tried them while excercising and was very difficult to get them to fit my ear they even made them a little sore from trying to get a better fit. Don't reccomend them"
4,I like it ..,Better than what I expected ..But still i cant find the perfect headphone that fits PERFECTLY ..
5,Editorial Comment,"'The book undoubtedly will stir controversy among chess fans and statisticians. Even if you skip the maths tables it is still a rattling good read.' Grandmaster Larry Evans, Syndicated Column, USA."
3,Proposal writing,"The author has good concepts to convey, but far not enough examples. I was looking for a book that had proposal writing principles with examples to compare to. I feel he could have expended the book by adding far more examples of winning and bad proposals."
2,Yet another bad female figure,"Hasbro has done it again with a poor female figure. The head is melon like and the lack of mobility is an oxymoron to the name ACTION FIGURE. Please, oh please tell someone at Hasbro to make a cool female figure. Go buy a CY Girl and copy it for crying out loud."
1,if your lookin' for a star wars alien.....Heeeeere it is....,"This has got to be the UGLIEST thing i have ever, ever seen!!!! I wanted to by the dumb thing, take of her outfit and put it on a nice looking doll and display that! But...I found out that her arms were painted purple! Now that is just plain wrong. Why even make the despicable thing! I swear, whoever made this is like a 2 yr old child trying to copy a Michalangelo picture or something!!!! They just plain got it alllllll wrong!Trust me - i read all of the other reviews.... all of those people were right! Don't waist your time and money on this despicable piece of junk! go buy your self lunch or somethin!"
2,What everyone has said is true...,"Sad but true, this figure is a disappointment. She has a limited degree of articulation. The arms are sad. They only move at the shoulders. Head moves, knees bend, legs move at hips (with a large range of motion there). Movable at waist/torso as well. Costume is painted on for upper body (purple arms and chest). Why oh why have they let us down? This is more like a freakish hybid cross of a megacephalic (oversized head) Barbie and a real action figure...something went severly wrong in the design and production process. Well, you have been warned."
2,Barbie in star wars disguie,"Wow-- i was so disappointed when i saw this figure. It's arms look like little pipe cleaners, it has a giant head, and it is out of scale both with itself and the other 12 inch figures. COME ON HASBRO!! what happened to the Hoth Leia and Defense of Naboo female body molds?? they fit in with the other figures. i WON'T be purchasing this mess."
2,Articulation a bounty hunter does make!,"First, the detail on the clothing is very good. Zam's helmet, binoculars, and armor are top tier work. The ""samurai"" skirt she wears could have been more than just a rubber piece with embossed details. This would have made up for a lot of the short comings.However, her head is too large and it is worse with the mask on. The worst part about this figure is that the articulation is liken more to that of a ""Barbie"" doll than a Star Wars 12"" figure, a bounty hunter no less. I know Hasbro has made some amazing female figures for the ""Joe"" line and this would have been the figure to use that template for. If you were disappointed with the Aurra Sing to the point where you wish you wouldnt have bought it, don't buy this figure. If you are a completest to some degree, then go ahead and pick it up. Be warned, this piece is not destined for dynamic dioramas."
3,"well, she isn't the greatest...","But I am a SW 12 inch collector so I had to get her. I got a GREAT deal on her so that made it better. I also ALWAYS keep the alien mask on her so she looks better. I agree that the scarf isn't made that well. It was a bit of a dissappointment that she was not made that well because I really liked her character. Her outit is great [minus the painted arms] with some really intricate parts to it. Overall, she was worth the sale price I got her at."
5,i take it with me almost everywhere,"This is the second siddur I have bought, the first one being a transliterated artscroll siddur in ashkenazi, which I wish I would have bought in sephardic instead, but at the time I didn't know the difference in translation. I prefer the sephardic because most of the endings of words are what is quoted in the congregation I attend... (for instance: ashkenazi= shabbos, sephardic= shabbat) this siddur covers more prayers than I knew existed, but of course, I have only been on this journey for 8 months. The typeset is fairly easy to read, and the binding seems to be holding together well. My two complaints are that the siddur came out of the package slightly damaged ( there was a slight tear at the top of the cover of the binding, and a few of the pages are quite wrinkled. But this siddur will be with me for a long time, I hope. I love having hebrew on one side, and english on the other. It is helping me to learn hebrew."
2,The translation to English,"This is about the worst translation of the Hebrew text imaginable. RamBam said exact translation is impossible, but a translater should try to put the Hebrew text into words as close to the same meaning as possible. The Artscroll siddur strays far from the equivalent meaning, giving the translation that the author wants to impress upon the reader, not what the Hebrew says or implies.Also, the many directions to the davener are a bad distraction, almost all of which are customs practiced in certain locals, & have nothing to do with mitzvoth."
1,Poor Copy,"This book needs a microscope to be able to read it. Luckily, I had a good seller that was more than willing to work with me on the refund since I found the book useless. Also, the notes in the book are great, however this is not really a Sepharidic Siddur as it uses Eastern European Minhag and transliteration. It uses the word Hashem to an annoying fault. If you are looking for a Sephardic Siddur that is legible, look elsewhere."
1,not what seller described,"it is not like the picture, it is is a small white book with someones name printed on it on their bar mitzvah. The print is so small it is unreadable without a magnifying glass. This was going to be a gift to an older person in need of a siddur for there use and it is still sitting on my desk. Very disappointed with seller description of the book and the picture of ""look inside"" is not what you get. Yes it is the same information within the pages, but they never described it being a siddur with someones name engraved, white cover and read only if you have super vision."
2,No idea from the dimension of it in the computer,"In the page of Amazon site doesn't says tha the book is a ""pocket edition""... It's not clear. Seems the same size of ""normal"" books. The book is good but the letters are small. I would buy the same book again, but in ""normal size""..."
2,Artscroll paperback Siddur: Possibly NOT for your eyes only !,"I give it 5 stars for being ""complete"" (i.e., The idea of having services for every holiday and every day of the week in one volume is wonderful). Ultimately, however, I give it 2 stars because: This paperback edition is totally useless to me. If you need reading glasses and are thinking of ordering The COMPLETE ARTSCROLL SIDDUR (paperback edition), make sure to visit your eye doctor and get those bifocals before this book arrives! The description of this ARTSCROLL edition uses words like ""clear""...and ""crisp type...""... but it is only clear and crisp if you can read miniature words or you have young eyes that haven't gone through ""the change"" yet!"
5,The Best Siddur You Can Find,"The Artscroll Siddur (prayer book) is a fantastic version of most of the Jewish prayers. It has sections on weekdays, Shabbat, and the holidays. Also included are weekly Torah readings, laws of prayer, and the entire book of Psalms. The Artscroll Siddur is written in fully vocalized Hebrew (with cantillation notes where they are used) with English translation on facing pages, and a detailed commentary in English. With clear printing and explanations for people who have only begun to use the Siddur, this is the best Siddur I have seen. Comes in pocket edition or hardcover."
5,Lara is awesome as always,I am not disappointed with this DVD at all. She has a wonderful voice and I would recommend it to anyone! She has such power and its too bad shes not well known in the United States.
3,Good Concert,I really enjoyed this DVD. Lara really showed her talent not only in singing but in putting her emotions into her music. I do not understand French but knew the feelings in the music.
1,A big loss,If you want to watch a show that is about nothing but sex than this is the show for you. Was sooooo disappointed!! Would not recommend this to anyone.
1,Season lover of movies,I am very happy with my purchase. I recieved in a timely manner and it was packaged perfectly.
3,Best season yet,"I think season three is probably better than season two of Private Practice, which is unusual for a tv drama. The plots are a little bit more believable and the characters are already well-established. I like the introduction of Amy Shephard (neurosurgeon), as I think she helps keeps things a bit grounded. This is probably my favourite series of Private Practice."
3,Visakey Large print keyboard,I am running Windows XP and find this keyboard does not! run well on this operating system.
2,It's really not that great...,"I'm not here to bash anyone for liking this guy but honestly, people are giving him just a little too much hype on here. I mean yea hes good and yes hes happy but its a little too much. I just saw this guy live at bamboozle and although he was good live it wasnt like life changing or anything. Honestly hes so bubbly and has such a high pitched voice even when hes talking that i really just cant take too much of it at once. The music is catchy yes, but one of the greatest albums of our time? Not at all, I'm surprised someone actually even wrote that. And since it seems everyone stresses this a lot, I'm not an emo kid. I'm 19 and I listen to pretty much anything u give me and for the most part i like it. Out of respect for his talents and hard work I won't say this cd or any of his cd's suck but i think people in here are making a much bigger deal than there needs to be. Listen to it, if u like his style then thats cool, if not, I completely understand."
1,"Forget about this CD, total shit","I was really disappointed with this CD... It is nothing like ""Calendar Days"". I mean I cannot find any song that's good... dunno what happened to Bryce's creativity but it seems to all have dissapeared... :( Actually a lot of the new bands of 2003 didn't succeed in doing an as good release in 2005 (Copeland, Mae, Anberlin, etc). ""Bratt Pack"", ""Treasures"", ""Goodbye Waves And Driveways"" and ""Story"" are the only almost decent tracks but they aren't good neither... I don't like the way he pushes his voice... he didn't do that on the previous album and it's really horrible to hear... I'd give this CD a 1.5 if I could though, but it's still crap. BTW I gave Calendar Days a 4 stars"
5,The Rocket Summer,"I first heard their song ""Show Me Everything You've Got"" in the NCAA Softball World Series. It was the theme, and I LOVED it. SO i went on i tunes and previewed the whole album liked it and purchased it. I think the songs are great and its a good buy."
3,sadly disappointed,"I was such a big fan of Calendar Days, and was excitedly awaiting the release of this next album. I was blown away by Bryce the first time I heard him on Calendar Days, but after the first listen of Hello Good Friend, I find myself thoroughly unimpressed. Bryce's musical ability is amazing, but this album doesn't come close to the raw energy and melodic songwriting skill of Calendar Days. I struggle to find one song on this album which really strikes me melodically as anything I would want to hear again and again. I saw Bryce live and even met him and was very impressed. I will keep listening and maybe something good will come of it, but I think I will have to wait for the next album, and then maybe he can regain the magic of Calendar Days."
5,Billy is right,"The rocket summer is a band about love, God and being happy. Bryce Avary is a very talented man that loves God and is happy.I would say that this cd will make everyone happy or i should say most. Im fourteen and i know music.GO BRYCE!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Rocket Summer,"This CD is very upbeat and has great lyrics. I absolutley love some songs, while I would just rather not listen to others. Overall, this would probably be appreciated by most teenagers, yet it is not the first CD i would suggest."
4,Fun game but not recommended for smaller children,"Although the movie is great for smaller children, I wouldn't recommend this game for younger kids. My daughter is almost 7 and has a hard time figuring out this game. Basically, it is mazes in which the 3 characters, Manny, Sid and Diego must manuver their way through obstacles in the maze to get to the next level. THe characters must work together and the player must switch between the characters to stop gushing geizers, swim through rivers, jump over canyons, etc. But after the first few levels, the game gets pretty hard for little ones. As an adult, I really like the game and find it challenging although I have had to look up a few hints. But it is too hard for the younger kids that the movie attracted. Would recommend this for ages 10 and up unless your child is particulary good with mazes."
4,Interesting,Maybe I am getting slow at 63 but this game is difficult. It moves slow and you don't have a big enough screen to see all you need to see to solve the puzzle. I will continue tho until I solve it.
4,A silly stupid movie that I love,"Let me be very clear, this is a stupid movie. I am not pretending it is otherwise. Let me also say, I love to watch it over and over. The plot is early 1970's rock verses Elvis ... Could Elvis have hung on to the young crowd if he maintained his edge. That is the question the movie tries to answer and in any good feel good movie the answer is yes. It is an Elvis ROCKY story. I love Elvis, I love the tone, I love question it asks and the respect for both sides it gives, and I love the way it was played by the actors. Call me stupid, I like this movie."
5,Master OF The Rare LASERDISCs Movies.,"I have Heartbreak Hotel ON LASERDISC,'TIS A great Comedy Movie,You will love it :)"
5,Elvis Lives!,"This is a fun movie to watch. David Keith has the right moves and you forget you aren't watching Elvis in Ohio! Yep, teenagers kidnap the King to bring him home for their mother, played well by Tuesday Weld. It's a great fantasy, and if you ever need a feel good movie, this is it. Even if you aren't an Elvis fan, the story is really interesting."
4,"Funny , But Inacurate !","The movie is quite comical to ' steal ' Elvis for a few days for a mom who's in love with hismusic and body ! The setting takes place in 1972 but the inacuracies are that Elvis plays Cleveland and mentions the ' concert in Pittsburgh on Sunday ' . He didn't play either city in 1972. He played CLeveland in ' 71 , and Pittsburgh in ' 73. The other inacuracy is that when he's on the motorcycle to go hunt down Johnny , it showed him on the motorcycle but the wheels aren't turning which is poor video and should've been caught in the editing room . Otherwise , a decent movie for fun ."
5,teetering on the brink,"I give this movie five stars even though the ending is contrived Soviet hogwash.But up until the last few minutes...it's wonderful.The characters are members of a film crew trying to hide from the Revolution in the resort towns of the Crimea. But of course they can't hide from history, and they know it. So they live through this last summer, already nostalgic for a present that is slipping away. Their love for what they are losing is overwhelming.THis was the first video I ever bought - I'm glad to see that it is out in DVD. It is beautifully filmed and acted and full of a wonderful bittersweet quality that anyone who has ever lived through a happy day and seen it end can identify with."
5,Pente,"Pente provides an opportunity to expand ones knowledge of strategy while remaining fun and full of challenge. Although the version offered to purchase is for two players, you can play with multiple people as pairs or if you purchase additional colored stones each person can play individually. it's a hoot when you get seven people playing together. Of course the rules change slightly. basically to capture a pair of stones in the two player game they need to be of the same color. however if you have more then two players a capture can be of two different colors. The more players the more the challenge. over all I'm exceedingly happy with my purchase i just wish they also provided the option of purchasing more stones of different colors."
1,Not Worth It,"This is the most useless Sailor Moon book ever. All of the information can be found by using a search engine on your computer. It is not worth the money, especially since internet sites are always changing and no book can possibly list them all accurately. If you want to find websites, search with Geocities, Yahoo, or another major search engine."
1,Not Worth It!,"The sites listed in this book could be found almost anywhere else, like on a search engine. The sites listed weren't extra spectacular, either. In the name of the Moon, this author should be punished!"
4,Interesting Documentary,"Overall, this is a solid NHL Production. It offers you insight into the role of endorcers, and lets you get to know McCarty, Lapierre, McKenzie, and Cairns on a personal level. The LaPierre part is very good. My only complaint is they could of found two better tough guys than Cairns or McKenzie. How about Georges Laraques or Matthew Barnaby? Anyways, DVD is only about an hour, not much on bonus features either. If your a hockey fan, you will enjoy the documentary though!"
1,Terrible,"Totally not worth the money at all. If I wanted to know about Cairns, McKenzies, Lapis or McCarty's famalies or what their lives are like outside of hockey I would watch NHL insider or a documentary or something. It was nice how they looked into each guy individually and how he portrayed his role as an enforcer. However they showed ABSOLUTELY no fights at all, except for a mila-second of McKenzie grappling with Grimson, or Cairns about to drop his gloves etc. Too bad this is the only NHL production of its kind right now, cause honestly I would say this is the worst buy I have made in a long time. If your looking into seeing good ol' time NHL fights, look elsewhere cause this DVD is Terrible!!!"
3,Street Fighter Anniversary Collection Stragetgy Guide,"The guide had great visuals and easy instructions on executing the moves/strategies of the characters. However, it worked far better with the Street Fighter 3rd Strike characters than the classic Street Figher characters."
5,What the critics say:,"""Simon is a wonderful and consummate piano man,"" said the Chicago Observer, ""...a no-nonsense hard bop blowing date and all parties are at their swingin'est."" In Jazztimes, Stanley Dance wrote, ""His solos swing relatively loosely...a thoroughly professinal date by men of whom more is sure to be heard."" And from Coda magazine: ""This fine working band creates intelligent, inventive, lyrical music."""
1,Like all other Chilton manuals. Never covers what you need.,I'm looking for a copy of the original Datsun shop manual. NOW THAT'S A REAL MANUAL.
2,good quick reference and general information,Bought book to give quick reference material. book covers range of model years. Detailed troubleshooting procedures for unusual problems requires datsun shop manual.
3,got more hype than deserved,"life and times of idi amin through the eyes of n garrigan (j mcavoy).garrigan ingratiates himself to the ugandan ruler and becomes his personal physician and ''dearest friend''.at first he seems empowered by the closeness until he finds such closeness comes with a price.while whitaker gives a very good performance,he nor his charactor were the stars.yes,his name is more recognizable than mcavoys,mcavoy had 90 % more screentime and was the central charactor.no way was this worthy of best LEADING actor award.he simply wasnt the leading actor."
2,five stars for whitaker zero stars for story,"'Nuff said, this was a sham from the beginning. Void of useful facts and documentation regarding the treaty of La Ceiset Navre. I am glad Forest got that award and all it is just to bad it took so long for people to notice what a fine actor he is. He should have gotten awards long before this film came out. Okay sorry I am acting like the rest of the Amazon Zombies and standing on a soapbox shouting ridiculous nonsense. If you want a lot of that just go see the Harry Potter forums goodness oh my grandmother what a joke!"
3,Over rated movie,"This is a worth while flick but nothing that great. What was the big deal of the performance of Forrest Whittacker?What I did not like (and maybe this is not a fair comment since the movie was supposed to be historical) is that Idi Amin was not depicted as the monster that I remember publicized from 1970's. Although not a hero, for the bulk of the movie he was a little bit charming...therefore, he did not come off as a monster/evil dictator.The protagonist was not that innocent. His promiscuity (especially having sex with Amin's baby's mama and trying to bed his employer's wife) made him kind of deserve the enivitable wrath coming his way.The movie was okay but it had no more impact then a made for tv movie. I was expecting more!"
2,The Truth Would Have Been Interesting,"Rather than using a fictionalized version through the eyes of a rather uninteresting (except for the Scottish accent), and utterly naive doctor as his improbable right hand man, why not writer a screenplay based upon Idi Amin's actual life and tailspin into the cliched king whose power and paranoia drives him crazy with bloodlust?Now, that would have been a film I may have watched to the end - not this one. It fizzled, then left one wanting.Yes, Forest Whitaker gave a superb performance, but not enough to save this bad screenplay."
3,"No, but if we did we'd probably deep fry them!","I'm always a bit miffed with theatric portrayals of historic events that seek to make a real life tragedy more dramatic. What happened in Uganda didn't need embellishing for mass consumption. That said, the film was well done and Whitaker earned his accolades fairly. McAvoy was great in it, as well. The writing was not terrific by any stretch, and either the direction or editing caused the plot to fall apart about a third of the way in. I'm not sure which it was, but after a wonderful carefully paced setup, events encapsulated and started to be so disjunct that they seemed out of character. I stuck through the latter half of it mostly to stay with Whitaker's performance."
4,Thought provoking movie,"I liked the movie, and thought Forest Whitaker did an outstanding job in the film. Story line was close to the history of the time, and the depiction of Idi Amin was very accurate. It's a movie that stimulates and provokes thinking about a lot of things. The movie is well worth seeing."
5,Very moving Story,"A very moving and educational story about dictator Idi Amin. While learning the dangers and mis adventures of a recent medical gradute, the viewer will see the hidden back story of a dictator and those who were near him on a daily bases."
3,More Forest please,Whitaker is great. The doctor despicable. The movie could have been so much more.
4,a movie that deserves to be seen... great performances..,"Last king of Scotland is a great historical drama that features one of the best performances of the decade.. Forrest whittaker is at his best in the role of the complex, comic, and at times terrifying idi amin... Worthy of the deepest respect this film entertains as much as it informs.. one of the best movies of the year without a doubt.."
5,Magnificent,"This movie was captivating! Each actor gave exceptional performances--passion, heart, and character were in each scene. This is a must see movie."
3,amateur director,"The early years of Idi Amin's reign of terror in Uganda (1970-79) as seen by his personal physician. Intense performances, fine script and authentic-looking cinematography compromised by annoying beer commercial-style direction. Inferior to ""Hotel Rwanda"" (2004)."
3,With a story this dramatic...,"why revise the truth?This is a chance for the world to remember this complicated monster - and for us to learn something about ourselves in the process. I can see how you might pick and choose from the facts when assembling a book (or movie), but why fiddle with them?Great, great performances, wonderful production value... but I just couldn't get over the dramatic license.Do, do, do watch the special features - there are candid interviews with people who were there (both colonial types and Ugandans), and even they are shaking their heads at some of the licenses."
3,informative,The acting was pretty good.There could have been more of his political life in the movie...
4,Totally deflating...... but wait.,"When I discovered this movie was fiction or at the best a ""based on"" movie I was disappointed. The central character, Dr. Garrigan played by James McAnvoy never existed.With that I changed my perspective & it is still a very good movie. A bit of a morality play. Of course it is the oft told tale of the corrosive effects of absolute power corrupting absolutely. Forest Whitaker playing dictator Idi Amin has the performance of his career. That & the other performances elevate this movie. Real live historical figures & events, with footage are interspersed with stories behind closed doors of the palace which are not fact. A major movie to see just for the acting if nothing else."
4,emilie,Very good movie. Forrest deserves an oscar for his portrayl of Idi Amin. I don't want to say what happens in the movie because it's too good to spoil it so see it for yourself.
5,Breath-taking performances!,"Forest Whitaker as Dictator Idi Amin of Uganda will take your breath away with his performance! Based on some true events, Amin befriends a young Scottish doctor trying to find his place in the world, but Dr. Garrigan isn't prepared for the moody dictator's secret dark side. Amin betrays his friends, family and his people when his positive speeches of helping all Uganda turn out to be a layer of lies. Amin's rule becomes a nightmare and Dr. Garrigan doesn't open his eyes to the truth soon enough. The acting in this movie is just outstanding with very memorable roles. I'm certainly prompted to pick up the book that inspired the movie given the great visual version of this story.Chrissy K. McVay - Author"
4,Horrifyingly Good,"Usually when I watch a movie, I see actors playing parts. People pretending to be other people to tell a story. Ultimately, only a flasehood to provide entertainment.Forets Whitaker did not preform in this movie. I never saw FW. I saw General Idi Amin Dada doing an autobiogaphical movie. I can not think of a suitable adjective to describe what FW did in this movie. It was not a preformance, not a job. He was that insane man and I don't even know that much about Amin. I jus tnever once felt that I was watching FW act.Damn fine movie over all. Sad and horrifying. See this movie if you have not already."
3,Good as an actors' showcase,"This movie works as a thriller and is worth seeing for the acting, which is great. Both Forest Whitaker and the guy who played the Scottish dude were excellent. If this movie was based on a true story, I'd give it a perfect rating. However, since it is fiction, it relies on too many Hollywood cliches, some of which border on racism.Why can't there be a movie about Africa that doesn't involve a main character who is white? Here you have a white guy who comes to Africa, sleeps with black women, gets terrorized by a large, savage black man, then becomes Jesus (in that he is more or less crucified only to be resurrected as a potential savior). The story of Adi Amin is interesting enough that it doesn't need to star a European white guy."
2,"Whitaker was great, in the twenty minutes you see him.",How is this a leading role for Whitaker? It's not. The leading character is a young kid from ireland. The greatest moments of Whitakers career go fleeting by like some hallucination. I can't tell you how dissapointed I was with this film. I just don't have the energy to plod on further. It's useless. Terrible film.
2,Another Bloddy Mess in Africa,"I had never heard of Forest Whitaker before this movie, and I feel that he is probably an excellent actor. However, in this semi-authentic biopic, he over-acted like an amateur. The movie was filled with gratuitis ""blood, guts and gore"" that were not necessary to the plot. Don Cheadle's ""Rwanda"" is far superior, as are several other movies on Idi Amin and Rwanda. I was disappointed that the director chose the sensational rather than to tell the story. This movie was like driving tacks with a sledge hammer."
2,.....because you are white......,Didn't like the movie. Loosely based movies rarely tell the whole story but was hoping for more truth than this one gave.
1,One of the most boring movies of the year,"First of all, this is about Adi's doctor, not Adi. Secondly, it was one of the most boring films of the year. It would have won my oscar as the most boring but that award went to Letters from Iwo Jima. I got up twice to go to the bathroom during this film and didn't even hurry back. I couldn't wait for it to end. It grossly minimizes Adi's human rights records as well as the raid on Intebi. Excuse my spelling."
4,Great Movie,"Forest was at his best in this movie. His performance was great and the tempo of the movie is absorbing. I do recommend it to lovers of movies, especailly if one wants to have an insight into some of the depravity that occurred in Africa during the reign of Amin"
4,Not for the squeamish,"This was beautifully done but brutal - no surprise considering its subject matter, but if your stomach is really sensitive you're better off just reading about Amin."
4,Gentling a Monster,"The doctor who is the central character of the movie is entirely fictional; otherwise the movie has much historical veracity.It is, like _Macbeth_, an unsuccessful attempt to humanize a monster. Idi Amin is given a more than wonderful performance--this alone is worth the price of admission. The supporting players are excellent. The insights into revolutionary politics are rewarding. The first sex scene is astonishing.Lots of violence for the bloodthirsty.I may add to this review when I watch it again.jivadas"
4,WHITAKER IS SENSATIONAL AS THE PARANOID DICTATOR IDI AMIN,"Based on Giles Foden's novel, THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND tells the story of a Scottish doctor played by James McAvoy who becomes Uganga dictator Idi Amin's personal physician. From this close perch, McAvoy's character (Nicholas Garrigan) is witness to the cruelity and brutality of Amin, played by Forest Whitacker. Mr. Whitaker is no less than sensational as the paranoid, murderous, emotionally immature dictator put in power by the Bristish (or so the film implies). Mr McAvoy at first seems a light weight both physically and dramatically to Mr. Whittaker's overpowering Amin, but as the film proceeds, Mr McAvoy develops a stronger screen presence. THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND is an entertaining peek at some contemporary African history, unfortunately all too often tragic."
4,Great Title Role,"Forrest Whitaker was born to play Idi Amin, evidently. He's got him down. He's even better in this than he was being Charlie Parker in ""Bird."" The script is a fanciful take on an imaginary doctor who becomes the dictator's advisor. There are a few love interests. Not too much violence. An entertaining watch."
3,"Really Good, but............","Be careful. If you are looking for a cd in the style of his first two, then be forewarned, it's almost nothing like those gems.This is more of a songrwriter type effort. It's good, and it's a departure.And I will say, it still qualifies as country, which shows the appitude of Campbell's talent. Unlike some of his comtempararies who go Alt. Country and end up sounding like some Neil Young wantabe, Campbell sticks with his country roots and forges his own sound.Go ahead and buy this cd, I have a feeling that Stacy Dean Campbell will finally get his due in the next 10 or so years."
5,Automoblox - a hit with me!,"What a great toy. It is actually amazing that this toy is educational, engaging, fun, and requires no batteries. My 2 1/2 yr. old B/G twins love these. They have the pink coupe, blue sedan, and green truck. I think I enjoy them more than they do."
5,Great car toy,We bought this as an addition to X9X. It's a great addition. My 2 year old loves to make a bigger car. It's awesome.
1,One star for deceptive listing and terrible customer service from the company,"Amazon was fantastic for solving our problem with this order!Deceptive because originally listed as VHF/UHF reception. This antenna is NOT a VHF antenna even though described as such. We thought we were buying the antenna described, but no. And, customer service from the company was nil so Amazon settled our claims for the problems we had. Thanks Amazon!!!!! Do yourself a favor and look at another antenna from another company."
3,Fun Game,We love this game. It is not nearly as bad as the reviews stated. I'm glad we didn't listen. Kids play it all the time.
2,No direction!,"If you're considering buy this game for a young child (my son is 6), FORGET IT! There is not a lot of visual direction to let you know where you're supposed to go. The first mission is with Roddy and is VERY difficult to complete (took a few days). I had to figure out on my own where I was supposed to go. The second mission is with Rita. I am in the middle of her mission and can not see where/how to complete this room (the room with the gears)- no one in our house can figure it out. This game takes place in the sewer and is VERY dark, sometimes impossible to see - GIVE ME A BREAK! It's very easy for the characters to get 'caught' or die. Too bad because without these major flaws, the game would be very fun. Having to figure out where to go in very dark places without direction ruins the game. Our son loves the movie but is not interested in playing the game. BUMMER!"
1,Flushed away,"You sent me a bad format game. The information the PS2 gives is no data available.To send the product back to you I had to pay mail expences and the chance of getting a new game was poor because the seal was violated, so I gave up.What you should have done was to see my country origin and send the correct data format game.My first and last purchase.Best regardsPedro"
3,"Good book, but............","The book is very nice and thorough, if you are interested in Hot Wheels products from 1989 thru 2008, which is not at all what I wanted and had expected. I was looking for the ""ultimate Guide"" for vintage versions. I may have missed the descriptions somewhere but it certainly is not addressed on the books cover or in the details that I read before ordering. The book cover should clearly indicate the years covered and it should be reflected in all descriptions. The book is excellent for those years that are covered."
3,Southern Vines for Southern Climes 1,"It's still growing, but we didn't have any flowers. Purchased because it's a plant native to our region."
1,dead honeysuckle,The Honeysuckle plant was dead 2 days after I got it. I had to throw it away. I will never order from this company again.
4,Nice variety of honeysuckle,"This plant arrived right in time to be buried for the winter. I wanted to put it into a better pot, so it would survive the winter and I discovered I had 2 plants, one big and the other a little smaller. Bonus. Because we have harsh winters her in Utah, with heavy snow, I opted to bury it in the ground by some other trees that will be covered with glass. Looking forward to seeing it again in the spring."
5,Harlequin Honeysuckle,"I received the Harlequin and unpacked it. I had ordered another honeysuckle (for a LOT more money) and this was packaged better, cheaper, and looks so good (as is growing). I now wish I had ordered more Harlequins because they seem so much better-the other one looks so BAD. Sigh"
3,"Arrived mostly dead,but great seller response","It was a very small plant, and it was almost dead when I got it. I unpacked it and almost all of the leaves were dead and immediately fell off. When I contacted the seller, they refunded it in about a minute, which was amazing. I was just disappointed, this was supposed to be a gift, and then I was left without one."
4,Not bad,"I enjoyed this book, I like it when the H and h are in love almost from the beginning and there are no misunderstandings. I did wonder why they couldn't have married in that time in order to protect her, even if he thought he'd be returning to the present day. Anyway it's a small quibble and it's worth reading."
1,Just got these tap sockets,I just received these tap sockets and they look beat up. I'm not sure if they are manufacture reject but they have machine wear marks and dents on the edges of the machined surface. The black finish is also discolored. I thought they might have been a used and then returned item but the inside of the sockets looks perfect. That is the only reason I'm keeping these sockets. I own the smaller set of Lisle tap sockets and use them daily. I am now skeptical of Amazon and Tooltopia sending me the best product possible.
4,Ernest Saves Christmas,"I always did like watching the Ernest films. I liked Earnest Saves Christmas because it had a nice message to it.The retiring Santa Claus believed in the young girl that he and Ernest met, they helped her realize she has a family who loves her and is waiting for her at home and she does not need to be someone she really is not. Good choice for the Santa Claus to replace the retiring one. Just a feel good movie. Made me smile."
5,good funny christmas movie,We got the movie fast and it is a good funny christmas movie all the family loved. Ernest is alway a good movie
1,Ernest Saves Christmas,The movie only played 6 min and wouldnt play anymore wasent happy with the movie at all. thanks jana adams
5,Wonderful seasonal movie that's become a tradition!,"We love this movie! It really has become a Christmas tradition in our home, right along with the classic White Christmas. It is a shame the studio is not currently providing it for sale. I hope they reconsider."
2,hard to watch the entire movie - stupid,"This movie is sooo ridiculous, with bad acting and idiotic story line. If I hadn't spent money to buy it, I would have never finised watching the movie and thrown it out."
4,we love Ernest,My kids love Ernest and this was fun for the whole family to watch together on Christmas eve. Lots of laughs
3,Not so funny...,I was hoping for more. Its an ok holiday movie if there isn't much else available. Ho ho hum. ~
3,funny funny stupid,"I just love the part when he's from, APOPKA SNAK3 RANCH, them's pieeesun snake, you want one for your boy?It's a classic Ernest movie, I think its his best"
5,Ernest is the BEST!!,"There's nothing like spending Christmas with Ernest!! This was my children's favorite Christmas movie (they are now 26 and 23)! I have all the classic Christmas movies, but did not have this one! I'm so glad to finally own my own copy!"
5,Merry Christmas Vern :),"Time to Deck the Halls, and put another yule on. Ernest is attempting to save christmas :) As good 'ol St. Nick gets busted it's up to Ernest (and his many personalities) to save him. Can he do it? Will Christmas be saved? Can Santa find his replacement in time? You'll just have to buy this fabulous DVD to find out :) Trust me. With a Jim Varney movie you won't be disappointed ;)"
4,Great fun,I hadn't seen this since I was a kid. I introduced it to another generation around Christmas time. A Christmas classic.
5,Chrsimas like you've never seen it before,this is a hillarious movie. this has to be one of the best ernest movies made. this movie is just to funny. I Recommend this movie for everyone :) jim varney is a comedic enius.
5,my favorite of all the Ernest movies,"I have always been a fan of the Ernest movies, but Ernest Saves Christmas has to be my favorite of all of them. It is a wonderful family comedy. another oldie but a goodie."
5,All Time Best Ernest Movie,"This movie is the Best Ernest movie they ever made. I make a point to watch it every Christmas when it is on TV, I would love to have a copy but unfortunetly they are no longer making it."
1,Very dissapointed!!!,Received wrong movie received Ernest Goes to Jail in stead of Ernest Saves Christmas!!! Would like to know how to get the right movie?
2,Ernest grows old!!,"After looking forward to adding this DVD to my Christmas collection,I was disappointed how ""Ernest humor"" has dwindled with age. I wasdiscouraged of how Ernest isn't funny anymore.Sad, but true. I miss Jim Varney."
5,This is one of the best DVDs ever.,"You can keep your Chanel Number 5...just give me a whiff of the old lonesome pine. Break's over, buy this DVD!"
4,Orlando - duh,What can I say? Large parts of the movie were done in Orlando and it has Ernest! A classic from the start.
2,Nothing special,Young adults return to summer camp that shaped their lives. Adult angst combines with remembered childhood angst. Resolved in the end. Pleasant but pointless and predictable. One viewing is more than enough.
4,A movie that needs to be watched at least 3 times,"I am a camp director and love the whole summer camp experience... having said that I would love Indian Summer either way.The cast is fantastic... including Sam Raimi who went to become a director of such small films as Spiderman. He alone is fantastic as the brilliant Camp Helper ""Stick"".Great performances by Bill Paxton, Kevin Pollack, and Diane Lane should be not overlooked.There are some great life lessons and some very funny and touching moments.This is a must see."
2,Having a bad night?,"Actually, I would have given this film one star, but I'm giving it two stars on account of the fact that if you have trouble sleeping, this is the perfect movie to watch. About ten to fifteen minutes ought to do before you doze off. The perfect remedy for your sleeping disorder. Don't even try to figure out how Diane Lane and Alan Arkin get mixed up in this mess. I thought summer camp was suppose to be fun...although that guy getting his hand dipped in pee was funny. Ok, so it got a chuckle out of me but I swear that's it. If you want to watch a good movie with Bill Paxton, go for ""A simple Plan"". In the mood for Diane Lane? Go for ""Murder at 1600"". Huge Alan Arkin fan? Check him out in ""Wait until Dark"". That final scene with Audrey Hepburn is priceless."
2,Indian Summer,A slice of life comedy that just doesn't work. The practical jokes are a little too cruel to be funny. The relationships are not entirely believable.
1,"If you like slapstick humor, you'll love this film","While the premise of the story - a group of childhood friends called back to experience the last year of their old summer camp - could have had a lot of potential, the movie repeatedly resorts to slapstick humor to carry you from scene to scene, as past and present interpersonal conflicts and relationships are clumsily explored, and trivial and childish behaviors are re-enacted, with the apparent expectation that the audience should remain interested. I gritted my teeth, but I have to admit that after an hour, I could no longer take it."
2,Boring!,"This is one of the most boring films I've ever seen. I definitely think it had the potential to be good. What I didn't like was that you didn't really get to know the characters. I felt like an outsider while watching this film. I think if the writers had started out the film showing us the characters as kids at camp then it would have been easier to identify with them. I also thought the actor who played ""Uncle Lou"" was awful. His acting stunk, although I thought all the others were good. I have fond memories of summer camp so I think the concept of a camp reunion is good, but this one bombed. No wonder it isn't wasn't very popular. I hope a better summer camp movie comes out soon."
1,Agh. Horrible! Wasted my time...,"I would've turned it off if I didn't promise my wife I'd watch it with her.A story about adults who go back to summer camp 25 years later... who does this?Aside from the unrealistic story line, there are several sub-plots of the 7 or so adults who are dealing with their pasts from 25 years ago, and with their present.Its jumpy, sporadic, very mildly funny and just about annoying.Not worth buying let along renting.F-"
5,Camping Euphoria,"Awesome...what drew me to this movie was Vincent Spano. His role as Matt Berman was played excellently. It made me think of my camp-days sweetheart. Other than that, I loved ""Uncle Lou""--His character was so rounded and warm. The pranks were outrageously hillarious. I laughed through all of them, even though they were a bit dry and not that funny, but they brought back camp-days--when pranks were just boring but fun. This is a good movie...it starts out with kid-like fun and memories, but it ends with each character learning something new about themselves. And that's what camp's all about...even if you haven't been there for 20-30-40-? years!"
5,Classic,I'm a camp person and this movie is always a good one to chase away the camp blues I get from time to time.
3,"Great movie, great pic, ruined by audio sync issues","I was eager to see the beauty of Camp Tamakwa on bluray, and the price was too low to pass up on this camping classic.Unfortunately, the audio transfer is simply terribly. Nearly every scene is ruined by sync issues. Normally I'd be the only one in the room to notice, but even the non-audiophiles in the room were asking why it felt like we were watching a kung-fu movie.If you can focus on the scenery and story, and not watch the characters' mouths, you can enjoy this bluray for $5. Otherwise, move along."
4,great,Loved the camp tricks. It brought back memories of my camp days. The song at the end was great. I had it on a 45 record in the early 60's. What a trip!
4,memories,"So many of the actions, incidents, characterizations, and outcomes were exactly to what I have experienced. A bit scary at first but enjoyable."
2,image quality,"Though the movie itself was good, the quality was so poor, the DVD was noteven to the VHS tapes quality standard"
5,Great movie!!,"I absolutely love this movie!!! I can't imagine how it is possible not to like it...what I found most interesting is that it shows how camp influences on the life of adults..there's always been so much talking about positive and profound influence on kids and I guess the fact that camp could have just the same profound influence on ""grown-ups"" always seemed to be a bit overlooked..Wonderful movie!! Made me feel very nostalgic about my own camp I spent 4 unforgettable summers.."
5,An all time favorite,"My husband and I have a handful of DVD's that we watch over and over - this is one of our favorites! If you ever went to camp as a kid, you'll love this movie - you'll also wish you went to THIS camp! Enjoy it over and over and over."
3,BUYER BE CAREFULL,This one is tricky for most of the dvds out there are full frame fitted format. But there are also some in the widescreen aspect ratio format. I was in best buy and had to study the packaging very carefully because you can barely tell the difference. on the back look for 2005 as the date in small print on the bottom and in tiny black letters widescreen. Both packages are totally alike except for the dates. It is true I have it in Widescreen.
3,"Bright, Attractive lights. But you have to wiggle them a lot in the charger to make contact","Bought these for my wife and another set for a sister. Everyone loves watching them gently change through all the soothing colors. They are bright enough for a casually/dimly lit room and last a while on a charge.But the charger is a pain in the butt. There are contacts under each egg for charging when set in the base. When properly positioned, a red LED on the base illuminates to indicate charging. But you have to spend a minute with each egg trying to get it just right so that the red LED lights.Note that the contacts were clean, and were again cleaned to be sure that was not the problem. There just isn't enough weight to an egg to ensure positive contact 100% of the time.. but it works."
4,Awesome--but you have to throw them out!!,"The color change is awesome, and transitions are nice and smooth. The glow from just one is awesome. Plus, unlike other LED items, the whole thing lights up, there aren't patches that stay dark. The thing I don't like is after they say about 500 charges, it won't accept charges anymore and you have to throw the whole thing out! That stinks! At least if they sold replacement Oggz for the charger it wouldn't be so bad, otherwise it would have been 5 stars."
5,Worth every penny,"OK, so they seem costly. I'm even memorized, there is not a kid on the planet from say 3-7 who will not love sleeping with them!They are roughly 3x the size of a large chicken egg, maybe more."
4,It's so adorable!,"I purchased this system over the weekend after I fell in love w/it. We are having a girl in June so we still have some time and this was just too cute to pass up. There were other moms in the store purchasing this as well! I did not think I would like the weird handle on the car seat but after carying it around for a bit I found it to be more comfortable than the regulare round handle. So, I gave 4 stars because baby is not here yet and I don't know how it will work for us then! So far I love it."
2,A gloomy look at life,"Grondahl may be famous in Europe, but there must be something in his writing that just doesn't translate well into English. Lucca is the protagonist who we are supposed to like: she is beautiful, talented, and tragic--or at least that's what I think Grondahl wanted his readers to feel. However, Lucca comes off as more of a prig than anything else, and Robert is so detached from those close to him that it is difficult for the reader to like him as well. Lucca is beautiful, and we know she will get any man she desires, and even those she doesn't. There is only one surprising scene in the novel, and it's a disturbingly gross one at that. The rest of the plot seems to be filled with shallow passionate moments and relationships that never go beyond chic Eupropean detachment.The author takes such a pessimisic view of love and life that it seemed better for my soul to stop reading Lucca than to finish it. But for some reason I did, and I can't say that I'm glad I have."
2,Couldn't get into it,"The reviews made it sound like I could get into this, but I'm about a quarter of the way through, and it's been an excruciating read. I read on the bus, and I often find my mind drifting, thinking about what I'm going to have for supper, for instance, or finding myself gazing out at the landscape. 86 pages and this hasn't grabbed me yet. Partly, I think it's that it is written with dialogue that's not set apart by quotation marks, so sorting out what is said, what is thought, and what is just narrative (and sometimes, who is saying it) is too much like work. It IS indeed a melancholy story, lots of married people having affairs, two depressed and depressing main characters who are not very likeable. Eh, think I'll move on to something else and give up on this one..."
3,Caught in a web of lies!,"On page 37 in the part about flirting props, the author mentions her friend ""Kate,"" who attracted lots of men on the street simply by carrying a radio during the last game of the 1994 World Series. An interesting anecdote. Interesting because THERE WAS NO WORLD SERIES IN 1994! It was cancelled because of the players' strike. Moral of the story: When making up anecdotes for your book, try to hire a fact checker!"
5,101 Ways to Flirt,101 Ways to Flirt - loved the book .. i gave it to my niece and nephew as they are shy and the book will really help them...great guide to social skills for all ages.
1,never again,"This book, made me look like a fool, people thought that I was a weirdo. all the guys that I were close with are all scared of me now, it was horrible advice that ruined my LIFE at school."
1,Horrible!,"I tried some of the examples in this book and was slapped, verbally abused, and embarrassed by the women I approached! Nothing seemed to work in this book. I had better luck with women just by saying ""Hi!"" Buying this book and using it's examples will ensure that you'll be masturbating and not dating for sure!"
3,So-so Flirtation Advice,"I am always looking at ""relationship"" books, whether I'm in one or not. Ideas for meeting new people are important ... good ones can always be shared with friends. This book didn't quite live up to my expectations. I found about 50% of the ideas to be good ones, but felt some of them were entirely too superficial. I confess to thoroughly enjoying the sections on meeting people in countries outside the US; understanding social mores really helps when travelling."
1,The book was unrealistic,The book was urealistic I did what the author said to do and it did not work. For the most part I was made fun of and poked fun at.
3,Flirt,"This book has some great ideas for getting the attention of someone, but it seemed to fall short of ""what do I do next?"" I'd recommend The RoMANtic's Guide. It gives hundreds of ways to have creative dates and to romance the man or woman in your life."
2,don't waste your time,too many unrealistic made-up scenarios. there are some helpful tips but nothing different from any other dating books. . .
2,Falls apart too easily,"I bought this for my 2 year old for Christmas. He liked it until he realized that with very little effort on his part, the tower came tumbling down. After that, that's all he did. It only played 2 songs which really irritated us. I don't see any educational value in watching a ball bounce down stairs. All in all, we were very disappointed."
2,Disappointing - doesn't compare to older models,"We have 2 Ball Party sets from 4 yrs ago and my 5-yr-old still likes to play with them. We got Symphony for our 1-yr-old thinking it would expand our set of interchangeable, build-it-your-way Ball Party parts. Big disappointment! They have made the balls and tunnels larger, so the new set doesn't fit with the old. You can only build the Symphony tower one way, so it is no longer a construction toy. My 1-yr-old does like to drop the balls and watch them go down, but why pay $35 for a toy that only does that?? And it has an annoying feature that the sound keeps coming back on after the child has crawled away, forcing the grown-ups to hop up and turn it off. Look around for the non-battery-powered older sets, or get a pound-the-ball toy instead for less than half the price."
1,Pieces came off the first try,"This toy was given to my son at his birth...but, we didn't break it out of the box until he was approx. 9 months old and could stand and drop the balls into the top. Not quite understanding exactly how the toy worked, he knocked it over and the top funnel pieces came right off. I put the toy back together...but, every time it fell over, the same pieces came off. I checked to make sure that the pieces weren't broken...and they seemed fine. Eventually, I just took the funnel pieces off and put them on the bookshelf. Maybe when my son is not so ""boy-like"", the toy will work for him. Hate to say it...I think this one is going to the consignment store. He does love the plastic balls that came with the tool...he carries them with him all around the house."
1,Piece of junk,"This is a flimsy, plastic piece of junk that is most certainly not worth $35. The tower comes apart too easily. Don't waste your money."
3,A Few Negatives Outweigh A Lot of Positives,"The tips are strong and cover a wide range of sizes, the compact design is great and sturdy.I have purchased 4 of these, over about 2 years. And enjoyed them all, until...When you drop it, and the end cap falls off, the spare bits ""explode"" out of the end of the screwdriver never to be found again. I put the blame on myself the first few times, but since it happened with all 4 I bought I have to say it is a tool problem. if they would add a clip for pocket storage, it would help. Although, dropping it during use will also result in lost bits.Also, no storage spot for the 4th bit will result in it falling out of the tool during storage, unless you take great care about where you store it, like not in a tool bag or pouch.Too bad, they got everything else right, including the price."
5,Nice!,It sure is nice to find a place to buy used books that are in great shape... Thanks for sending the book so quickly! Jute
2,Chinese quality,"This product is made in China or Taiwan and it shows. The plastic parts have rough, unfinished edges; some parts are silver, some parts are gray and some are black. After two weeks of usage the white numbers indicating the gears just disappeared from the shifters. Grips are quite wide and can be cut to the desired width. One side of the grip is finished with the close end, which will allow you to put these grips without adding extra bar ends.These grip shifts work but for the price they should be better designed and better made."
5,SRAM X0 Twist shift,"Excellent product, shifts very accurately with its 1:1 actuation. A lot of twist shifters are somewhat inaccurate at selecting the gear you want, especially when changing down several gears at a time. I have paired these up with the SRAM X0 derailleur and always have flawless shifts. With the limit screws set up correctly on my derailleurs I have never had problems with the chain coming off with over shifts. Only con is that they are a little more expensive than alternative shifters, but not so expensive that you can't justify their price. Overall very good performance for the money."
5,My Favorite Book!,"It is not only my favorite book but also my index ,because i just study one year by myself of this book and i've got very good skills especially in grammar .So i'll recommend anyone who likes to learn enlish fast to choose this book.So just look at it one time and i'm sure you'll like it ,blieve me!."
1,AMAZON PROBLEM,"THE BOOK IS GOOD, BUT PROBLEM WITH AMAZON - WE RECEIVED THE HIGHER PRICED ""NEW"" BOOK FROM AMAZON DAMAGED. THE FRONT PAGES SEEM BURNED... IF I KNEW THIS I WOULD HAVE BOUGHT THE USED FROM OTHER PERSON."
4,Great Book,I've recently received this book and it's really useful for those who want to learn grammar.The only problem I had was the delivering but Amazom helped me very well.
4,USEFULL GRAMMER BOOK,It is one of the good/detailed grammer books I've seen.I received it on time and in good condition.
4,Excellent,"This book is excellent for people, whom is studying English as second languaje, hightly recommeded."
2,The book was not in good conditions,"Most of the exercises are done. The book is not clean. He squared the grammars with red pen and add to every one a star with orange pen. The book's edge is corrupted. All in all, I'm not satisfied about this book. The best condition for this book is fair. I am going to return this book"
4,it is a good book for ESL,good great awesome for beginner who they want to learn english grammar and understanding using english correctly. I recomend this book
2,Too many markings,Too many markings in the book. It was very hard to study from it. I would not recommend to buy exercise book with a lot of markings.
4,Understanding and Using English Grammar (with Answer Key and Audio CDs) (4th Edition),I like this book a lot. It's very useful in the class and colorful pictures shows vivid examples. Great book. The CD ROM is helpful as well. Good for inside class teaching and stay home self study.
5,Love Kenny Chesney!!!,I buy everything Kenny...and he never disappionts!! We like to atch these to get ready for his tour in the summer.
2,Great idea...,"It's a great idea but it doesn't work. I bought it and tried it after a small glass of beer. It turned green, meaning there was alcohol in my breastmilk. Astonished by the result, I put some water on a different strip and got the same result."
2,Milkscreen,"Im not sure if these things work or not but for me every time i drink i wait a hr for every drink. Well i stopped drinking bout 1am & drank at least 8 mixed drinks & 3 shots. Its now 7:30am & i tested both breast & they both came out clean. I would of deff thought that they would have came out not clean bc i drank alot lol, so im gonna wait till the afternoon to breastfeed him just to be on the safer side. Also not sure if this makes a difference, but im 5'9 210lbs. idk if that makes a difference for alcohol cosumption."
2,too sensitive?,"the cut off of detection for these is 13mg/dl of alcohol- one drink has about 13-14 GRAMS per 50ml, if you do the conversion a regular shot of alcohol has a concentration of about 28,000 mg/dl. It doesn't seem like the cut off point for these of 13mg/dl could be detrimental to a baby, even if it is only 8 lbs and has an immature liver. There's traces of jet fuel, flames retardants from furniture, etc in your breast milk for pete's sake"
1,Common sense is cheaper!,"While I think the creators of this product have great intentions, this is just one more example of marketing unneccesary items to breastfeeding mothers.Current research indicates that drinking *in moderation* is fine while breastfeeding your child. The amount of alcohol that actually makes it into your breastmilk is very small (less than 2%). The AAP, La Leche League and other authorities in the field all agree that a glass of wine is safe.Put it this way - if you're concerned enough about the level of alcohol in your bloodstream to consider testing your milk, then breastfeeding is the least of your worries! If you're too tipsy to nurse your baby, then you're too tipsy to parent your baby. Use a little common sense!Also, just wanted to stress that pumping and dumping is not neccessary, and does nothing to speed the process of alcohol leaving your milk/bloodstream. Mum can pump & dump for comfort, but beyond that, there's no need."
2,can we trust it?,"The language of the package and headline could not get it more wrong. Yes, there is controversy over how to spell ""Merrimac/Merrimack"".BUT:this ship was never, ever called, by either side, ""USS Virginia"".Nor was she ever called ""CSS Merrimack"".She was initially USS Merrimac[k], later rechristened CSS Virginia (a common practice for captured ships, except in the Royal Navy in Napoleonic times) following her reconstruction from a wooden sail/steam frigate in US service to an armored ram in CS service.Point being: if the presenter and manufacturer cannot get the most basic details of the ship right, then how good can the model be?She was USS Merrimack, then CSS Virginia. Period."
3,My daughter would give this 5 Stars,"I would give it 2 stars, so we met in the middle. My 35 month old loves this movie, but it drives me crazy. She wants to watch it all the time. I wouldn't mind if it was like the real Adventures of Winnie the Pooh, but it is just a bunch of silly stories. I wish they had come up with some new Pooh storied for this DVD, but they just put 5 older ones . There also needs to be more bonus features. Oh well! Maybe next year"
1,He Reviewed His OWN book,"The sole review posted here of the book, giving it ""five stars"" is by the book's author. How is that anything but a conflict of interest? Amazon should really not allow this sort of thing."
1,Why would...,"...an astrophysicist be studying an ark? Maybe Pleiades or whatnot, but a boat, astronomy, what's the deal? No matter, spoiler warning - the ark is able to end starvation because it's made of delicious chocolate and cheese nips, and it's extremely large.Tasty."
1,Valueless Review????,"I am a hypocrite. I am condemning you for giving this ""book"" a five star rating when you did not read it. My review is no more valueless than yours. I may be a hypocrite, but at least I am honest about it."
1,"#3,965,563, You've Gotta be Kidding!","I read Thomas Sutton's e-mail to Mr. Taranto and it was so well written I find it hard to believe such a great author could receive such a poor rating. Perhaps it is the subject matter he chose is too difficult for us normal Americans to comprehend!I'd tell you not to buy the book, but I too never read it and with numbers like that, it probably isn't necessary."
2,sly way to move up the charts...,"Maybe he'll double, triple, or even quadruple his sales from all the traffic his letter generated...pure genius. I'll keep checking to see if he cracks the #3,800,000 mark, or continues the downward spiral to #4,000,000."
2,What is all the excitement about?,"A hopelessly vain, and much hardened leftist publishes a vanity book, that is nothing more than a verbose and poorly written description of leftist prophecy come true.Seems a little pedestrian to me and not quite worthy of all the kerfuffle."
1,An unintentionally humorous work,"A confusing tale focusing on stock characters who think Noah's Ark contains the solution to global warming.If you're into camp, you might enjoy this odd book; if you're not, look elsewhere."
1,Zager and Evans Redux,"I have not read this book, but did spend nearly a minute looking at the cover which seems to consist of amorphous blobs.The title, '2199' reminds me of the one hit wonder, 'In the year 2525' which rhymed badly.""In the year 9595I'm kinda wondering if man is gonna be aliveHe's taken everything this old earth can giveAnd he ain't put back nothing"""
5,Finally the Perfect Bag - Too Bad I Never Get to Use It!,"I purchased the Tamrac Velocity 5 for myself to use with my digital camera equipment. I needed something that would allow me to carry everything, including ""stuff"" from my purse.I received the bag and my son took one look at it and claimed it as his own for use with his slr, lens and whatever else he needs to carry. The bag is perfect to take to soccer games when he is coaching - he can put it around his waist and not worry about it.The bag is light enough so it can be filled and not weigh you down. It balances perfectly whether carrying it with the shoulder strap or using it as a hip pack.Now I just need to buy another one for myself!"
2,Nicely made but miss represented,"I have back problems and was looking for a hip pack. I found the Tamrac 5745 on Tamrac's website and looked at the in use illustration which showed an SLR with a 4"" lens mounted, a flash on one side of the mounted lens and two short lenses on the otehr side of the mounted lens.When it arrived, I found that I could only fit my Nikon D-70s with it's lens mounted and one other short Nikon AF lens in the case. To be fair, you could squeeze a couple of rolls of 35mm film in on the side opporsite the mounted lens. Tamrack must have used an old Nikon FG SLR with manual focus lenses when the did the illustration. It was VERY misleading!This is not the sellers fault, it it Tamrac's miss representation of the product. I won't buy one of their products unless I can touch it first!"
2,Nice pack but didn't work for me,"This is a well constructed pack with nice belt and shoulder strap, but it didn't work for me. I bought it to carry my FZ28 with lens hood attached. There are two velcro straps along the length of the internal walls of the pack to fasten the dividers. The lens hood caught on these straps when I would try to insert the camera in the bag making it a 2 handed and slow operation, so I returned the bag."
4,Great for a compact SLR kit,"I really liked this bag. It is comfortable and well made, can be worn on the front of your waist for quick access, and has nice accessory pocket for memory and even fits my miniature Bogen tripod. It is best used with a compact SLR 2-lens Kit or a prosumer SLR like super-zoom. It will fit up to 3 lenses or 2 lenses and a flash. That being said I had to give it to my wife because I began upgrading and adding to my kit lenses which are rather compact to faster f2.8-35 lenses which are much larger in diameter. In this situation my 50-200 is a very tight fit and will just fit with my E-500 and an 11-22. I can just fit a teleconverter in the bag but the 14-45 is a no-go. I am now looking at a velocity 8 for my setup. One last note, my buckle did break but was an easy fix for a few bucks. My wife uses it now for her Canon S3 and cellphone..."
3,NICE COLLECTION FROM THE BANG ERA,"It's great to hear these songs in stereo after listening to my scratchy, old mono 45's for many years. Overall, the sound quality is good, though remastering is called for. Some of the tunes have too much treble. I wish they had included ""The Long Way Home,"" and a sessionography would have been nice."
3,It was a great movie,"I remember watched it when it first came to lifetimes or ABC, I am not sure. I was battling with seizure, I couldn't take my eyes off that movie. It seems so true. I thought that diet might helped me, but guess what? I am healed! I had never tried diet, I am healed by the LOVE of GOD. no joking, it is a size of mustard seed in faith...He shall heal you. Everyone thought it is mediences but come on, it is not as effeciently as His power."
3,'First Do No Harm' is just OK,"Lorenzo's Oil is a much better screenplay and compelling story.I am surprised Meryl Streep agreed to do this film with such a weak screenplay. The story is significant, but the rendering is just OK.Too bad there isn't a more compelling film that deals with epilepsy."
4,Healing is often in natural products,This story tells us that healing is often in natural products. Taking a lot of medicines is not always the way 'the cure'. Being aware of what we eat and drink. So I see this story not only for those who are sick. Going back to the basic (for example what we eat) can help a lot. A good story with a child acting so bravely.
5,Changed My Life,"As I student studying to be a pediatric neurologist, this movie changed my life. I know that what I have seen in this film will change the way I think about what's really behind medicine.This was a great movie. I think I burst out crying every five minutes from beginning to end. Keep a box of tissues nearby! The acting was superb, so well done that it felt very real. And it is real--it's a true story, and the true story of many people in the world who are going through the same things that the characters in this film faced.This movie is an inspiration to all; to medical workers or families of children with handicaps, even to someone who just needs to see how courage, faith and love can make dreams come true."
5,Updike's Best -- According to a long-time fan.,"I have read at least twenty of his novels, and seemingly hundreds of his short stories. 'Ford' is, I believe, his best, his best-represented, and yes, his most pessimistic novel to date (I haven't read the latest 'Bech' book yet). It is this book that accounts Updike's personal hatred for humanity, and will possibly leave the reader shopping for a handgun with a removeable mouthpiece. I regret that such fine writing from such a wordster's hand could be so sad, but alas, this is far from a perfect world."
2,Not Another Late Night,"If you are a fan of The ""Another Late Night"" series that feature artists such as Zero 7, Fila Brazillia and Groove Armada you will be disappointed with this effort. That by all intents and purposes according to my research doesn't share the flavor of others in the Another Late Night Series. Most if not all of the others mixes in the series shared a theme or ""story"" of sorts if you know what I mean. Not so much as something you would dance to in a club, but music that you load into the player of your car for a long drive or music that though with a beat that can be played while you work (which I play in my office) or around home. I found the beat more club-like, that is to say that club music is bad which it isn't and has its place. But it doesn't fit well with the series whose name it touts. It has it place to be sure. Just not here."
5,It worked for me!,"We have a very willful, active golden retriever puppy that we wanted to have obedience training without breaking her spirit. Maray's KISS Method was the perfect answer. The lessons were simple, effective and we immediately saw results. Ms. Ayres provided insight into how a dog learns and responds to human interaction, which has helped us immensely in dealing with our dog. It was also helpful to watch Maray work with dogs that had some previous training-it gave us an excellent model for our own lessons. We didn't buy the video as proof that Ms. Ayres could train dogs, but to learn how to work with our own dog. In addition, we loved the safety tips and drills included with the video. Not only do we feel better equipped to handle anything with our dog, but also we have learned how to do it without stressing out the dog or ourselves!"
1,how awfull,"these (movie star/celebrities) dogs were obviously previously trained. As she was giving the 'sit' command, she would say it as the dog was already starting to sit on its own. she would do all trainings within a 6 foot radius. Even my 13 week old puppy will come to me when I am 4 feet away and have her on a leash yanking. It is when she is farther away that I want to be able to get her to come... In closing - this is the worst video for any 'special interest' I have ever seen. This film provided absolutely no usefull content as far as training a dog. It should have been named- 'common sense with dogs'."
2,Busted,"This is not a very good bobblehead. The detail is OK, but not as good as the others, The construction of the bobble portion is more cheaply done. His face looks a bit wierd in person, especially around the eyes. Lastly, the item came with all fingers on the left hand broken off. This is my second bobble head in a row that came damaged. I am a big Michael Myers fan, but other figures would be better to purchase."
4,American History Changed,"This book tells the story of people in a rural Upstate NY county that was slated to receive nuclear waste as mandated by the federal govt. Find out how their movement changed the course of America because they refused to accept that they were ""economically and politically powerless"". Inspiring and educational."
5,Awesome,Little mess and cooks nearly a whole pound of thick cut bacon in one shot. Easy to clean up and breaks down for easy storage.
3,Lazy Bacon,I only eat center cut bacon because it has less fat then some of the other ones. I have a 750 Watt microwave it took about 5 mins to cook. The bacon seemed a little dry to me still good but part of me thinks this kind of bacon might just be better pan fried. At first I hung each bacon piece over the little racks but when it cooked the bacon curled into it's other side meaning it would not be easy to straighten out for a BLT because the bacon piece was stuck together. So next I laid out the bacon over all 3 racks and although less bacon pieces fit they did stay straight during cooking process. So...maybe I will try this product again with a different kind of bacon. All in all not a bad way to cook bacon the lazy way.
5,This makes it so Easy!,"Fast shipping and so glad to get a new one!! My old one literally lasted fifteen years and finally bit the dust! I love this because the bacon doesnt have to sit in grease so somehow makes it seem ""healthier"" to me. Dishwasher safe and great product. Only wish it was a tiny bit bigger!"
4,Better Bacon,This device is easy to use and easy to clean and helps get bacon on the table in no time!
4,Functional and great at minimizing grease,"I bought this product in Target several years ago. I love that you suspend the bacon and the fat just drips off in the receptacle below. I had a problem with the ""T"" inserts though. 2 of them broke when trying to pull them out. With one, the base of the ""T"" broke off and remained in the hole so that slot was unusable. With that said, when I went online to buy a new one, I compared what was out there. I still think it's one of the best products on the market for bacon so I recently purchased another one through amazon. To my delight, my 8 y/o son has learned to use it safely and independently. When we're done cooking with it, we turn it upside down on top of the garbage so the fat drips off directly in there and doesn't congeal in the sink."
3,Easy to use for small bacon jobs,I really like this bacon cooker. It works best when I only want a few slices for my family. I can only cook about 4 to 5 slices because putting more than that will cause the bacon to stick together. You would have to pull the ends apart (and they're really hot) in order to get nice flat pieces of bacon. I usually drape the bacon all the way across the top of the T shapes. That way the ends don't stick together during cooking. It's easier to flatten the bacon out when cooking is finished. I like that the tray is really easy to clean. You just pour the grease off at the end of the cook time. Bacon is really crispy.
1,Makes bacon loops,"It does cook the bacon in the microwave as advertised, but the materials are cheap and the strips of bacon stuck together while cooking, forming bacon ""loops."" I attempted to pull the bacon apart after cooking, but it was too hot to handle immediately after removing it from the microwave. And, after it had cooled for a few seconds, it crumbled when I continued to pull it apart. I even tried draping the strips of bacon over 2 of the three racks on each end of the drip pan, leaving an empty space where the third rack should have been in the middle, but the bacon just slid off and fell into the grease in the drip pan. Also, the paper towel did not stay on during cooking, probably because I have a rotating glass base in the bottom of my microwave. I used this product twice, then threw it away. Good concept, poor execution. Not worth the money."
4,Family Favorite,I bought this bacon rack to replace the one I lost. Usually I don't cook as much bacon as shown; so one piece goes across all three supports. All the family loves cooking bacon this way. It is easy and doesn't require constant attention.
3,It works but ..,"It works but the posts are flimsyand I don't expect them to lastmuch longer. Just be careful,because they will break.Poor material and quality overall.Won't buy it the second time."
1,Makin Bacon Microwave cooker,"NOT impressed. I have been using the WowBacon cooker for over a year now and love it. I was hoping the Makin Bacon would cook the bacon as quickly and as crispy because it holds more bacon. It is extemely MESSY. You can go through a half a roll of paper towels or deal with your microwave being saturated in grease. And pouring the grease form the unit is a disaster. It leaves the bacon greasy, rubbery and the lower half of the bacon uncooked as well. I am glad I only paid $14 for it.(For those who truly want CRISPY, NON greasy bacon and virtually NO MESS...go with the WowBacon microwave cooker. It's worth every penny)"
2,No So Great,I was really excited to get this bacon cooker and equally as disappointed when using it. I'm not sure how the dimensions were arrived at but this cooker is too small to hold bacon in most configurations without the ends dangling in the cooker and drippings. The big selling point to me was having the bacon fat reduced due to the bacon being elevated above the drip pan. Close but no cigar.
1,Simply Horrid!,"This made a complete mess in the microwave and the bacon did not cook evenly. The half of the pieces that were on the very outside were cooked, the other half of those pieces were almost raw along with the middle that were completely raw. YUCK! I have always liked the Bacon Wave or the Bacon Genie. I will be going back to one or the other."
2,We quit using it,"The concept is good. We tried it several times, but don't use it anymore.The main reasion was that this cooking method gave the bacon an off-taste. The taste difference is like comparing burgers cooked in a Teflon pan vs. on a grill.It also leaves the bacon much saltier. Maybe low-sodium bacon is worth a try.Went back to original pan frying for better flavor and less salt remaining in the bacon. Draining on layers of paper towels gets rid of the grease and keeps it warm.Mmmmm bacon....surprisingly low in cholesterol too."
1,Don't Buy it!!!,This thing doesn't work. Part of the bacon is completely black and burned and the other part is still RAW!! Don't buy this item. It's terrible and you will regret it because it's a waste of money and doesn't work.
4,Cooking bacon a breeze!,"I dreaded using the round, grooved plate with a lid to cook bacon in the microwave. I could cook only 4 or 5 pieces at a time and the plate always became stained brown and no matter how I scrubbed, it never looked clean. And the lid would look bad after a while, too. Storing it took up a fair amount of space as well.This cooker allows you to cook a pound in one fell swoop! So much faster!The only draw back for me--and I don't know if others have experienced this--is that if you like your bacon crispy, it is virtually impossible to get it off the ""hangers"" and unbend it without breaking it. So we eat our bacon bent in half!Other than that, it's totally worth the money. And takes up just a little storage space. Cheapest at Wal-mart."
4,Would have been a five star but still GREAT!,"My husband and I LOVE this bacon maker! It cooks our bacon perfectly; You just have to adjust the time according to the number of slices you are cooking and the wattage of your microwave. I would have rated it five stars if the racks weren't so short. Apparently the bacon we use is too long. To avoid having it hanging into the drippings in the tray we have to lay the bacon accross the three racks all at once, therefore cooking only 4-5 slices at a time. OTher than that small design issue, it works great! I would totally recommend this to others."
1,big disappointment,"This seemed like a great idea, but I have gone back to the rack style where you lay the bacon on the grooves. Using this product, the slices stuck together, and didn't cook as evenly. Other reviews seemed more positive, but I just gave mine away."
2,Should be titlded Eastern Washington Best Lake Fly Fishing,"Don't buy this book if you want any insights into Western Washington lake fly fishing, you won't find anything you don't already know. The author admits this by pointing out in the introduction that most of Washington's productive lakes are on the eastside. But, he seems to gloss over many westside lakes I already knew about. I'm sure it's a good guide for the upper Columbia region, but as far as being comprehensive, its not."
5,Love this book!,"This book has been so useful to me in my work with youth struggling with difficult feelings and behaviors. The table in the front that separates activities by age, modality, and theme is a great guide and one that I reference often. Many of these techniques help clients gain access to intangible ideas such as anger, stress, and sadness through tangible projects and games. ""Feelings Tic Tac Toe"" (pg. 34-35) is a favorite among my clients!!! The section of activities aimed at coping with feelings is a valuable resource and a special addition that can't be found in many play therapy activity/technique resources. The self-esteem activities are unique and fun, and the graduation section has helped me develop successful terminations with those youth who have worked hard and are finishing their work with me. I'd recommend this book to anyone who has felt ""stuck"" with clients, as it has definitely helped me conceptualize therapeutic ideas in a different way."
5,Stop Trying to Reinvent The Wheel... Just Buy The Book,I used to waste a lot of time trying to force creative ideas from myself. Liana's books have ended my torment. I have stopped trying to reinvent wheels and started spending more time helping children and families. Buy the books! You won't regret it!
4,Great Book,This book has fabulous exercises for working with children. It also provides nice worksheets that you can just copy and use. I would definitely recommend it for any counsellor or therapist working with kids.
5,Highly Reccomended!,"Great book...I use it again and again. Good adaptations of regular childhood games, good ideas for working with kids in elementary school! Very much worth the price!"
3,good basic activities,Great activities for younger children just starting in treatment or youth that struggle to verbalize issues. I used it in a an after school setting and activities can be non threatening or can be used intro into deeper issues. Good for just starting out as a therapist
2,too many arts and crafts,"As a mental health therapist, I found this book to be very hands on and not as appropriate for a therapuetic setting."
5,A must have for therapists,"For years I have worked with abuse victims, and this book has an activity for most any issue I come across. We wear this book out in our agency, and it is constantly being checked out for use. Highly recommend it! @bethyf78"
5,Creative Interventions for Troubled Children and Youth,A good resource for using existing games and adding activities to them to make themeven more valuable for working with children!
2,What could have been,The interventions are creative. I did not like that the interventions called for specific 'toys'. I don't think the game 'hot pototato' is made anymore
5,Great Resource!,I do intensive in-home therapy with children and found this book to be a great resource...has tons of activities suitable for one client and many could be used for a group setting as well...another perk was you are given a website link where you can download another book (for free)...makes my job much easier and my sessions more exciting/fun for my clients!
4,Great for novice therapist,"I bought this book when I was fresh out of graduate school and starting my first job under supervision. This book has great ideas that are easy, very therapeutic for the children I work with, and also inspiring for coming up with my own creative techniques."
2,Don't have to buy a book to find interventions like these,"Bought the book hoping to find some creative ways to engage children and youth. With some web searching, I could find similar interventions/ideas. Also, the book relies on purchasing a lot of kids games, which may or may not fit your budget. Perhaps the book could be of some use to someone who has no idea what to do, but it turned out to be not that useful to me."
2,"good looking, but I had to return it","bought one and had to return. Noticed two problems: first, the power cord socket is too large and the power cord does get inserted but loose. I had too change a few power cord until I located a fat one. The second problem is more serious problem for me: I am very picky on image quality because my own work and habit. I got the same problem, quite exactly, as the one mentioned by the review posted by ""an electrioncs fan from Washington, DC"". then I noticed another review from a networking consultant from connecticut. I guess we all have encounter more or less similar problems. I am glad that I am not the only one, but on the other hand, I did fall in love with this one and now I have to look for another monitor."
1,Two flaws too many,"My first LCD monitor. First impression was great, but then:Picture is very contrasty. The auto setting puts the brightness to it's max, but it needs more range. I could live with that, but also..The left side of my monitor was brighter (and warmer - yellow, when the rest was blueish). Very annoying, especially doing grahphic/video work. I sent it back for another, and it was worse! Maybe a bad batch of backlights. I'm sending that back, too and will try another brand. Very dissapointing."
3,dual input monitor adapters!,"I have two machines at home, one running windows xp and the other one running Linux/Windows 98. They are both plugged intothis LCD display! There is a switch on the display that allows you to switch from Input 1 to Input 2 and vice versa. Of course, you could you use a switch box instead if you decided to get a different monitor/lcd display. However, the switch box kind of degrade the resolution; so I have experienced.The quality of picture on this unit is amazing. I cannot be happier. I set its angle down a bit to reduce the glare. By doing so I noticed the picture display is better (based on my preference).It's so easy to setup as well. There is a compartment on the back that allows you to hide the two input cables + 1 power cord. This display is a space saver as well.This is one of my best buys!"
2,The Rock Side of Blues Rock,"The rock side of blues rock. Three chord frenzies and the secret of loud amps, distortion and reverb revealed yet again. A cut above most records in building dynamics into arrangements ... loud is louder after quiet passages. Another one that sounds designed as a bar band demo recording, because a band that can drive like this all night = a good night for the bar and everyone in it. Their original songs probably get a lot of live requests. In a regional blues talent contest, everyone in the audience would recognize The Hellhounds as strong contenders for the prize"
3,Not as shown,"The raccoon cover i received is of good quality, and is cute enough, but i looks nothing like the picture. The one I received had no tail and no hind feet, and the front paws are just flat and tied together in the front. My husband was happy enough with it, but it's not as nice as the picture."
3,Tempermental,"The battery backup feature is good until your battery runs low. You cannot use it with just the adapter, the clock goes out of sync. The alarm went off at 3:30AM for a 7:00AM wakeup setting, thus prompting this review. It has 2 alarms, allowing you for 2 different time settings. For the first 3 months, you can turn off the alarm on the weekend, but soon, that option became unavailable since it won't take that command anymore. So, I've learned to readjust my timer to maybe 9AM on the weekend, which is no big deal. But for it not to be operable on the adapter alone is baffling to me. Also, the blue display can be a bit bright at night. If you dim it down for sleep, you'll have to readjust during the day or you won't be able to read the time."
1,Really hard to program!,This phone is really hard to program but the clock is easy to read and the radio has really good sound and reception.The handset has menu buttons on the palm side of you had when you pick it up and more then once I have disconnected the caller when the lights were out.Overall - it's nice to look at.
1,Completely missed the mark.,"I was expecting to see the classic Chachun episodes, something like episodes from Season 1. Instead, you get 8 episodes from the last season of this show (around 1985) when the main characters are ""Nina"" and ""Jagger"". ""Chicho"" (Fernando Arau), ""Lenguardo"" (Alfredo Alegr?a), ""Baby"" (Alma Delfina), and ""Calixto"" (Rodolfo Rodr?guez) do not appear in any of these episodes. It's a big dissapointment, imagine you get a ""Happy Days"" dvd and instead of getting Richie Cunningham, ""Potsie"" Weber and Ralph Malph you get ""Chachi"" Arcola, Jenny Piccalo and Fonzie with a beard. Wait for a better set of episodes to be released."
5,Excellent book about helping others,"Beautiful Story. It has everything: A fun story, a great message, silly words, and lets your imagination fly with tales about Castles and kingdoms, witches and elves, flying brooms... Gloria is a nice witch that goes the ""Extra mile"" just to help his friends to start talking to each other again. The pictures are adorable..."
4,a christmas favorite,My children received this book when they were young at christmas time. It became one of their favorite books and I had to read it all the time until they knew the story by heart. My children are now in college and I will be purchasing for a friends three year old granddaughter. The illustrations are colorful and beautiful. My children have wonderful memories of this book.
5,HAMILTON BEACH 68120 Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt Maker,"1st time I used it, i made a great tasting ice cream. 2nd try, I deviated from the recipe in an attempt to make a lowfat ice cream and failed. my fault though. Third try, I made an excellent low fat ice cream by modifying an existing recipe. The machine is great, it makes just about the right amount of ice cream."
2,For Hardcore Fans Only,"The track ""How Can I Refuse"" didn't make it very far into the charts, and subsequently no other song was released (that I know of). ""Sleep Alone"" is definitely the best single, displaying Ann's wonderful bone-chilling voice with a touch of some excellent guitar (which unfortunately is absent through much of the CD). This CD and Private Audition came at the 1982-83 time frame when Heart was experimenting with drums and turning to Top 40. If you are a hardcore Ann Wilson fan as I am, you'll enjoy this one."
3,the title says it all,"This one is pretty sexy. Ann Wilson's multi-tonal range is thestar of the show, especially on ""How Can I Refuse"",""Johnny Moon"" and ""Blue Guitar.""Sleep Alone"" is so engrossing with the lyrics and that relentless guitar rhythem. ""Passionworks"" is by no means one of Heart's best albums, but it is worth a listen."
3,Bad production!,"Good songs, terrible production. If the production had been better, the second single, ""Allies"" would've been a #1 hit, a definitive 1980s power ballad, and Heart would've gotten back on top commercially two years earlier than they did. This is a sonic mess, and the drums are guaranteed to drive you crazy...If you like this, better choices are Heart (1985) and Bad Animals (1987). Avoid the anemic Private Audition (1982) and Brigade (1990)."
5,Music to unwind the mind and soul,"What an awesome piece of work!! I am a huge Heart fan, and nothing suits me better after a stressful day, than to kick back and jam out to Passion Works!! This album is truly a work of art, however, a word of warning: If you're looking for your everday-average-tasteless-boring-run-of-the-mill-generic album, you might want to check the rap and r&b section."
5,Passionworks is an EXCELLENT album!,"When ""Passionworks"" was released, I rushed out & bought it. I fell in love with it as soon as I finished hearing it for the 1st time.Why it never became a HUGE hit is something I don't understand. It's just as good or better than ""Heart"" from 1985.Both ""How Can I Refuse"" & ""Allies"" should have made the charts & ""Allies"" should have soared to #1. ""Sleep Alone"", ""Together Now"", ""Heavy Heart"" & ""Language of Love"" are all stand out songs on the album.It's my FAVORITE Heart album."
4,Collectors must have,"If you are a Heart fan, you should not neglect having this one in you collection. It was not one of their most popular works, however it has some great hits and some songs that are familiar to the nostalgia conscious. (""I haven't heard that one in a LONG time!"") It will surely make you smile."
3,The Crew,This is an ok tape. The previews of it was a little better than the movie. Not much action but a lot of talk. It is something to watch to kill time is about all I can truthfully say about it.
3,The crew needs to retire,"Having read some very good reviews about this movie. I decided to purchase a copy! O-K we have moved on & times change, however the plot is a good one the players just do not perform to the script. Not least the main players are supported by the supporting cast to such a degree that it is they who make the script work.O-K I am English but I have a sense of humour unlike this movie Sorry!!!"
4,"Definatly worth a look, very funny and well done","The Crew is acually a very funny enjoyable movie. I will admit the plot is a little weak, but it's not horrible. It is basically about four ex crew members {Dreyfuss and company} want to stay in their appartment, so of course they set up a fake killing to keep their appartment. And along the way they meet a firy widow { Kazan}, a tenasious stripper { Jeniffer Tilly}, and a policeinvestogator who might just be Dreyfuss's long lost daughter { Carrie Anne Moss}. A bit corny......Yes but still very enjoyable. Without a doubt the three major female roles are what holds together this film. Kazan is hillarios as the old widow deli owner. Tilly is great and very enthusiastic as the female stripper ""dating"" one of the crew members for the money. And Moss is exellent as the police officer { in a short seen you get to see her do two more matrix kicks! don't miss it} and her part is no doubt way to short."
3,As harmless as a basket of kittens,"and thats why it gets three stars,for entertaining without being foul-mouthed or violent. I mean, I love violent, foul-mouthed movies as much as the next guy or gal, but rarely do you see a movie marketed to adults as mild as this. Its as toothless as some of its extras. The only prurient element in the movie is Jennifer Tilly's stripper character, who is busting (oh, look, I made a pun) out of a sequined bikini most of the movie. Aging mobsters try to feel young again by making some trouble. Fugheddaboutit if you dont have a family, but rent it for your own crew if you have one."
3,Four Guys And Three Ladies in Gangster Comedy,"Very lightweight comedy ""The Crew"" was about four ex-gangsters now living in Miami, where they try to scheme with a shotgun like old days; only this time for escaping eviction notice. And it worked ... at first.The good part of the film is its male cast (Dreyfuss, Hedaya, Reynolds, Cassel: plus good female players, especially ""The Matrix""'s Moss, who again gives a toe kick to her ex-boyfriend (short scene, don't miss it). To be honest, the story is weak, and the script tends to lose its focus, but just watching these guys and ladies almost compensates. The film gradually improves as it goes on, so wait for a while until Dreyfuss's slightly annoying narration vanishes. The film is co-produced by Barry Sonnenfeld (of ""MIB""), so if he had directed, the result might have been different.By the way, of the four gangsters, Dreyfuss is the youngest (b. 1947); next, Hedaya (b. 1940); Reynolds (b. 1936), and Cassel (b. 1935)."
5,Great movie,All I can say is if you like movies about the mob then you will enjoy this light hearted look into a crew of retired mobsters and it has a wonderful plot to it .
2,Goodfellas with an Older Cast,"I didn't think so much about this movie. I thought it was going to be such a stupid excuse for a movie. But it actually turned out to be one that I enjoyed. Richard Dreyfuss heads an all-star cast along with Seymour Cassell, Dan Hedeya, Burt Reynolds, and Carrie Anne-Moss. The story follows the four main characters from their time as mob hit-men to their time in a retirement home in Florida. They're fired from every job possible, trying to survive the now envaded Florida scenery. They yet again turn to crime to make everything ok again. Packed with good comedy and great actors, the Crew is not to be missed."
1,Don't waste your money on this book,"I read the reviews here and thought they were useful so I bought the book. To my horror, this author basically undermines the authority of Scripture by stating that the Bible is unreliable in matters of science, history, morals and what not. Then he tries to build on whatever authority is left after he has effectively tells the reader that little of what the Bible says is true. A classic example of man's reason overriding that of revelation. For me, I take the Scripture's side anytime. The Bible is true in what it says, whether it be science or history, even morals. It has the full authority of God in what it says."
2,"fine for mom, but toddler had a reaction","I thought this was a great deal- four sun sticks for my son- we could keep one in the diaper bag, one at daycare, etc. But he had an allergic reaction to something in the product. I don't know what- he has used products with all of those sunscreen ingredients before, but this product made his face bright red and itchy. Perhaps it was one of the inactive ingredients? I use it, and it's fine for me, but that really wasn't the point."
4,good skin cream,"My wife have 3 weeks using it, I feel my face smooth and not dry.I hope all my wrinkle disappear in the minor time of using it.I do not give all the 5 stars because I need a magic cream to take away all my wrinkles.Maybe this cream need more time to the optimum result.This is not a bad offer because amazon give you two creams for the price of one, !great offer!.If this offer continue I will buy it again.Thanks amazon."
1,Useful but flimsy,I borrowed from a friend and brought the Coleman Compact Table on a 4 day camping trip to Death Valley. The table was very useful and conveniently fit into my 4Runner with all sorts of other gear. Giving this one star though because it broke within a few days of normal use. The problem is that the plastic sockets where the table folds into are very flimsy and brittle. Within two days one plastic socket broke and the table legs got all folded up the wrong way. Easy fix and working great until it happens a second time. This time another socket broke and the legs turned into a twisted pretzel of junk. Almost impossible to fold up correctly now and destined for the dump.
1,Don't Order it!,"I ordered several of these tables as Christmas presents, two of five arrived broken. Both of the broken tables had broken slats in the top and one also had a broken bracket on one of the legs. The tops are made out of a brittle plastic, spend more money and order a table with a metal top."
1,This table is very flimsy and overpriced,"I don't think I have ever run across a more overpriced, flimsy piece of camping gear; and for this very poorly engineered and built table to actually come from Coleman was rather a shock. The first time I opened the box containing this table was while setting up the camp site. Too late: the table was so delicate that the main parts that hold it together -- the leg anchors that support the equally flimsy and fragile aluminum cross pieces -- had been broken in the simple act of shipping. I looked closer, and these main supports were made of some incredibly cheap, delicate plastic. This thing wouldn't have lasted a day on a campsite, even if it had survived shipping! (We placed the table in the campsite's trash dumper the next morning). Buy a lower cost table from another company -- no need to even go to a higher priced unit, since anything else would be better designed and constructed than this table."
1,Poor Easily Breaking Design,"This table is very poorly designed, same as these other reviewers, the plastic connection-joints were broken before we even used it.We didn't notice until we tried to take it camping, so lovely Target wouldn't take it back past the 90 days, even though it sat in our garage in the new box.So I tried to order a replacement table, this one arrived broken as well. So I tried one more time, and guess what? This one arrived broken as well.I am now contacting Coleman as the table is supposed to have a 5 year warranty. But I don't want another Coleman table! I advise others with this breaky-table to call Coleman and complain! 800-835-3278Our friends have used another table for years and it has never broken: Orion roll a table.Follow up: Coleman actualy sent us a new table with new-updated design & it works great! They arranged to have the broken one picked up & shipped us the new one at no cost. Good service Coleman!!"
5,Great table.,I am a U.S. Soldier and I demand a lot from the gear that I buy. I purchased one of these tables from the px and have used it in very precarious areas to go shooting and camping and it has worked great. Unlike other posts would have you to believe it is coated aluminum table top and light weight steel legs and as I recall off the top of my head it is rated for 400lbs. But it's like most gear and you have to have half a brain and set it up properly in order to have it perform correctly if you don't you will break it. so I say it is a great light weight easily portable heavy duty table that works great as long as you use your head and use the gear proper.
4,Nice surprise,"I was a bit reluctant to buy this DVD mostly because I do not see the pair Alagna Gheorghiu as belcanto singers. However I was pleased of proving myself wrong. They both are superb in their roles. I do not know if this is my personal impression or what, but Gheorghiu's voice has some of Maria Callas' texture. On the other hand I have never been a big fan of Algna but I have to admit that he is great in the role of Nemorino, both acting and singing. His version of ""Una furtiva lacrima"" is not quite ortodox though but it is OK anyway."
4,"Performance 5 Stars, Technical 3 Stars","I heartily second the raves of other about the performance on this DVD; it's a charming production and most highly recommended.However, a word of warning for those of you with 'standard' TV screens. The packaging claims the disc is anamorphic, but in reality it simply chops off the sides of the picture. This is not a problem during the opera, but during the extra 'Making Of' documentary, the subtitles are frequently off the screen. The menu is also a bit flaky. However, it's nice that Decca actually put an extra on the disc (a rarity for performance DVDs), so I hope they work out the technical glitches on future releases."
4,Infectious energy,very enjoyable. There is a lot of energy on stage and it makes a very lively performance. Fun light opera
3,Forgive me while I laugh out loud.,"Angela Gheorghiu. Roberto Alagna. A story of love from a distance and unrealistic expectations. Love potions that the first person takes hoping that the second person falls in love with the first person? Isn't that turned around? unscrupulous snake medico's and a military leader using trickery on a naif? 'tis ever thus. People do that. It has been ""modernized"" to the early twentieth century."
1,I want those men fired!!!,"I was looking forward to watching this DVD, but thanks to incomptent authoring by Miles Tudor and Philip Rowlands, who botched the 16x9 enhancement so that it doesn't work on all players, including mine, producing a painful image that ought to require these men be subjected to Argento Opera meets Space Warriors 2000, for all two of you who get my joke, as the two similarly screwed up The Death of Klinghoffer. Please make sure this disc is compatible with your player before you buy it."
5,Great production of a simple but very enjoyable opera!,"This is by all means a very good production of a simple but very enjoyable opera. The cast is great. The singing is very good, but what makes this production special is that all the singers act very well and they also look their part. They look like they enjoyed themselves on stage and so does one watching them.Please don't listen to the idiot who sais this is a poor production. You can see clearly that he has no idea of what he is saying when he sais it can't be good just because it is filmed in Lyon! He clearly has no idea of the great productions one can see nowadays all throughout Europe.L'Elisir is a funny opera with lovable tunes and this production really achieves that. The sound quality is very good, even though it's true that the sound is a little narrow, with too much coming from the middle, specially in 5.1.I sincerely recommend it! Great buy!"
5,one of the best skate vids,"Going into Menikmati the documentary feel in the beginning made me worry a bit. I've got absolutely nothing against a skating documentary but after seeing the names of the eS team members I could not wait to see their skate parts. Luckily, Menikmati doesn't disapoint. It has an overly formulaic structure of including a skater intro followed by a regular skate part and then a slow-mo section, but the skating is so amazing that it doesn't really take away from your enjoyment (although I will say that the regular motion shots included as a dvd extra were so much more entertaining than their slow-mo counterparts and I've watched that montage in regular motion again and again). Tom Penny sticks out as always. His skating and the intro to his part really caught my attention and it was great to see on the dvd extras a chance to look at penny skating from a young age and watching that progression as he developed his skating skills over the years. Highly, highly recommended!"
2,Unimaginative!,Ms. Howe's vision is suspect when her over-intellectualized poems prefer pat phrases and obvious cliches over direct treatment of the subject
2,"ADF not reliable, PDF conversion does not work","I bought a 7490c scanner mainly because I needed to convert paper documents to PDF files.Unfortunately, even if the scanner works quite well without using the ADF or preparing PDF documents, I could not succeed in doing what I needed.The Automatic document feeder is not reliable for scanning A4 papers, since while taking the papers it often rotates them giving a rotated image as a result.Moreover the Hp precision scan pro 3.0 software has a bug in producing black and white PDF files , and HP does not know how to fix it.Therefore, if you need to have a large number of pages scanned , avoid this scanner and go for a fujitsu."
3,only slightly dated,"The title track is cool, despite the fact that is is an overwrought, melodramtic epic in the Jim Steinman vein. You should get this only because it has the full length version of Total Eclipse of the Heart, one of the best pop singles ever.What remains is a bland, slightly dated but not unenjoyable mix of pop/rock drama whose one and only saving grace is the incredible voice of Bonnie Tyler."
3,Good Addition to Library,"Although there's only half an album of memorable songs here, they are worthy additions to any early-80's collection."
4,Ghost Appear and Fade Away,"Men At Work defined early 80's pop music for the MTV generation and still remains effective in 2010. Personally, I prefer the debut album, yet several Top 10 hits from Cargo avoided a sophomore slump many young artist experience. Too bad the chemistry of the group did not last longer than it did, but ghost appear and fade away (Overkill). Thank goodness the music remains as fresh today as it sounded on the airways nearly 30 years ago. If you do not already have this CD in your collection, you really should. While not serious music, it has the ability to lift up one's spirits."
3,Good mix for relaxing,"Good mix of music from the band, missing the well known ""Men Down Under"" but otherwise some really good hits."
4,You like Men at Work?,"I saw Colin Hay play 'Overkill' accousticly on an episode of Scrubs last year and it reminded me of some of the great work the band put out in the '80'sand early '90's. Can't say that I adore every song, but his writing skills are really solid. It's a good recording to have in a collection. Definitely one to play when everything else sounds the same."
1,"If they're men at work, then why do they sound like slackers?","This album is a classic example of the term ""sophomore slump."" ""Cargo"" had only ONE hit single: the aptly named ""Overkill."" The others, ""Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Jive"" and the appropriately-named ""It's a Mistake"" FLOPPED. Miss Terri needs to wake up. It's 2006, and who cares about these dumb kangaroos? If you're into music from Australia, then your ONLY option is Kylie Minogue."
3,An enjoyable album.,"I've always liked Men at Work. I remember listening to some of the songs from this album for the first time many years ago. Cargo is a pretty solid and listenable piece of music. The songwriting, musicianship, and production are quite satisfying and tight. Cargo is in a pop rock musical direction, and the album is mostly guitar-oriented--keyboards are only used sparingly. There's some good guitar playing throughout the album. Colin Hay has a unique and easily recognizable vocal style, also. Guitarist Ron Strykert handles the lead vocals on a couple of tracks (""Settle Down My Boy"" and ""I Like to""). There's a total of ten tracks on Cargo. Some of the songs that I like are ""Dr. Heckyll & Mr. Jive,"" ""Overkill,"" ""It's a Mistake,"" and ""High Wire."" ""Overkill"" is my favorite song. It has an impressive intro, and the saxophone playing is also nice. ""Settle Down My Boy,"" ""Blue for You,"" and ""I Like to"" are just okay. Cargo is enjoyable and worth a listen."
2,Pretty bad unles you like cocktail lounge trio,Got it cheap (way cheaper than here) and though I like light touch or Ellis Larkins and others not Bud acolytes with fire in their left (or right) hands you are better off with say a Lou Levy or many others.He has another title which also has good song selection on RCA Italian with a Guitarist added for a Quartet (which recorded some great stuff Dictators son Romano Mussolini)and maybe it's better but this LP was languid and soft enough to put you to sleep.Try before you buy if your a jazz fan and think of great pianists from Italy like Renatto Selanni and others.There is so much great Jazz from late 50's and 60's on Continent and Italy (Basso Valdamrbini sextet and others that they played with were right their in quality with American counterparts) and maybe Torvajoli has the chops and this was just to make some pleasant background music for cash but jazz fans again try before you buy.CheersChazz
3,Slew Dem......this one's a stika!,"This CD is a bit old school but carries a few old chestnuts. I bought this for the Slew Dem track at the end as it is impossible to download it (legally) otherwise and it's a right stinka!There is some interesting tracks and a nice variety of flavours from soulful, scratching, bouncy, reggae tips and some oldish school and some down right filthy D n B also.I would not recommend this to someone who only likes their liquid beats and uplifting tunes but certainly for anyone who wants to add something to their collection, this is worthy a buy.I particularly enjoy the esthetics of the picture on the front and even better, the inside of the insert.......priceless big pimping!As for the company who sold this to me, they provided an excellent service. This came from America within a week, well packaged, sealed and in fine condition. I would recommend them to anyone. V. Good.Brrrrrrah, Brrrrrrrrah!"
5,Great,Much better than the Memery 59 and Memery X16! Plus it holds more than 4X than the Mem. 59 card. Also its from Ninendo them selves so you know that it is quality work.
4,Good but 16x is WAY BETTER!,"This memory card is pretty good. Although, it's good, memory card x16 has 1019 blocks. The Memory Card 16x is usually ony about $20 now so I would recommend getting a 16x. For people who need a lot of memory, I've seen a 32x memory card but I'm not sure if GameCube can handle it so the memory may become corrput on the 32x."
3,"Good Card, but...","The Nintendo 251 Memory Card is a good deal, but for those who already own a 59 block card, C'mon! How much memory does one person need!? 59 blocks are plenty, because by the time that you run out of space, there is bound to be games that are saved on the card that you don't even play anymore, so you can just delete them, and BAM! More free space! A generous amount of space, but ultimately unnecessary and a waste of money for current 59 block owners. A good FIRST memory card, though..."
1,Horrible! Erased all my Records.,"THIS MEMORY CARD IS HORRIBLE! IT ERASED ALL MY DATA WHEN IT SPAZZED OUT TODAY. WHEN I BUY A ""QUALITY MEMORY CARD"", I EXPECT IT TO WORK. I RECCOMEND IT TO PEOPLE WHO WANT TO WASTE $20, AND LOSE WHAT THEY'VE WORKED ON FOR WEEKS, EVEN MONTHS, LIKE I DID. DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Only 251 blocks BOOOO!!!!!!,Why Get this one when you can get one from Mad Catz that has 1019 blocks
4,GameCube 251,"You listed the features for the GameCube Memory Card 59, but you did not list the features for the GameCube 251 Memory Card. Due to the price difference, I would like to see the difference."
4,A must have item for your Game cube,If you play the game Cube a lot chances are you'll have many saved games. With 251 blocks the Game Cube 251 Memory Card has four times the storage of the smaller Memory Card 59. The 251 card is ideal for most game cube gamers. Most games now use about 5 to 10 blocks for the save games. There are a few games that can use over 50 Blocks that will just about fill out the smaller card. The only reason that I use a smaller card would be to dedicate it to one game like Animal Crossing that has huge save files 57 blocks.
4,Everything is good except the space.,This memory card works awesome. My only complaint is that there isn't enough space available to save lots of memory.
3,Not quite as good as I was hoping for,"I liked Tony Martin in Sabbath, in fact Headless Cross and Cross Purposes are some of my favorite Black Sabbath cd's.However this release doesn't really follow that path and for me that is somewhat of a disappointment. The songs are pretty good, but their just missing something overall. I don't now, maybe they sound to happy?Tony's a great singer and a fantastic lyricist, but this release is just average in my books especially because I know he can do so much more!I'd rate it as average, really nothing to write home about here unfortunately."
3,British Models show most of their all,"Volume 3 of the Electric Blue series is a so-so colection of the always favorite Marie Harper, the quite lovely Shanine Litton and a half dozen other models. Not as good as Volume 1, but nothing that Playboy should be worrying about either."
2,Electric Blue,"What can I say but total disappointment, poor casting, lousy everything. Nothing I expected. Really a total waste. You win some, you lose some."
1,Not Gleeck's Best book,"Fred Gleeck has written other books that I've profited from, notably ""Marketing and Promoting Your Own Seminars and Workshops."" But this book is basically a rehash from other books, and doesn't provide much useful info in any level of useful depth."
2,Not what I expected!!,"I was hoping for a book which would give detailed instructions on how to preserve my old documents and photos. This book is more of how to write and publish a book using your old documents, diaries, photos, etc. I have no doubt that the author is brilliant, but this book did not cover what I needed to learn."
1,Yuck,"We love Jimmy Stewart, but this is a lame movie. We didn't like any of the characters, even Jimmy's. Seemed low-budget."
4,Enjoyable,"It was fun watching an old racy movie, love Jimmy Stewart. It was maybe a little slow getting going, and perhaps predicatble but very entertaining once it got moving. The music (Duke Ellington) was a delight."
5,Worth the Read!!!,"Having seen the movie Glory for the first time this past weekend, I couldn't help but wonder about the 54th and its Colonel Shaw. So, when I got my hands on this book I had very high expectations. I have to say that I was very happy with the quality of this book. It has just enough sentiment for Colonel Shaw and his family, yet it also portrays the 54th as the heroes I believe they were. I would recommend this to any history buff, or to anyone who finds that they had the same thirst as I after seeing Glory on television. Great book.."
3,"Meh...Another typical ""Viking Metal"" Album","This CD wasn't bad, it just was not good by any means. I think this is their 3rd album? I'd say they burned out on the first and second. I listened to this album a few times over and there was nothing that stood out. Most of the songs break down into typical ""viking"" like guitar rhythms and too often the songs go on unnecessarily long with the same riff over and over. Certain songs like Chariots of Power sound good at first, until the choir like vocals come in, and they just sound silly.. talking about magic hammers or something. it just sounds lame. It embarrasses me to blast when I'm driving around. The choir is in a few of the songs and it just doesn't sound right. Contrary to the reviews I have seen about the vocals from earlier albums, I do like the harsh black metalish style. So I would recommend listening to their earlier albums which seem to be a bit more fresh."
1,Worse Indi Film,"This movie is beyond horrible day and night shots are horrible, the acting is horrible, and just plain sucks. Whoever did the casting for this shouldn't be allowed to cast anyone again. I hope the directors have real jobs and are not banking on this they will be in the poor house"
3,"Pretty good mix of parts, some missing...","It's a good mix. I did a detailed inventory against the included parts list and found several parts missing. I sent an email to the manufacturer, was promised the missing parts, but never received anything."
2,A lot of the Integrated Circuits are defective,"Many of the integrated circuits are defective. The product would be a good deal if it were composed of working parts, but since it is a mixed bag, it really isn't worth the money."
3,"Lots of parts, but aggravating to use","Lots of parts shipped in bags. As mentioned in other reviews, some parts were missing (a few diodes). The major difficulty is that none of the part numbers on the box match the part numbers on the actual components, so figuring out which is which or how to use them requires google and a magnifier."
3,"OK, but not great","Item showed up very quickly and everything was there. The only problem I have with it is that many of the components had bent pins, one of the pins on a 7 segment LED was flat up against the housing. All of the resistors I can straighten out easily, but very poorly packed. Luckily, everything seems to work so far."
3,Bad Practice,"Shipped quickly, and it has a large variety of parts. Good for starting up a components collection. The reason I'm rating it a 3 is that none of the items came in ESD safe material, in fact just the opposite. Everything came in small sealed plastic bags. All the components seem to be fine, but its very bad practice if you ask me, enough for me to rate a 3."
5,The Least you NEED to know about English,"As an English teacher, I often find it difficult attaining grammar books that are accessable to all students. The Least You Should Know About English provides comprehensive lessons that students can understand, and also gives a wealth of exercises. The book deals with all grammar errors-fragments, usage, parallel structure, shifts in time, apostrophe-as well as proofreading exercies. For times you struggle with the correct answer, an answer key is provided. I found this book ideal in my high school classroom, since so many students lack the grammar background needed to be successful in writing."
2,OK Book,Nice book but missing some aircraft such as the F-18 and OH-58. I see this book in stores selling for about $6 new and at that price it's probably worth it.
1,Spice packet missing,"I came online to contact the company and found the review by Roraww with similar issues. I purchased Heritage Select Basmati Rice with Rosemary & Olive oil at my local grocer but there was no spice packet included. There seemed to be a bit of spice in the rice, but the directions said ""1. Rinse rice in water"" which rinsed away any flavor that might have been there. Strange."
4,another in this popular kids video series,"Truck Driver Dave and Truck Driver Becky are up to their usually goofy antics as they explore the world of trucks here. We have about ten of this series and I would rank this in the middle -- on the plus side, there is the good-natured banter between the two affable leads and the over-arching mystery of what they are hauling in their 18-wheeler, on the minus side there is at least one lengthy segment from another video in the series, and our toddler doesn't really like it when a car is damaged.Dave and Becky look at tow trucks, garbage trucks, a monster truck and the biggest truck in the world, which hauls the Space Shuttle out to its launch pad. They also visit shipping facilities that work with large truck containers.Dave and Becky work well together, and this video is popular in our house. Chances are, your child will like it too."
4,Almost a spoof of itself and of kids video.,"My two-year-old likes to watch this, but I think it's hilarious. It's almost like a spoof of the whole genre of truck/car/fire-engine videos for infants.There's comedy galore on this tape: all the bickering in the truck (but it's always good-natured); the sub-plot of trying to determine what cargo they're carrying in the truck (top secret military stuff?); the mishaps that occur when they flash back to their various truck experiences (especially the tow-truck scene); and then of course the surprise ending when they find out what their cargo actually is.It's so bad it's great. Your infant may not get much of it, but you may actually like to watch this with him/her."
3,Not yet over the moon,"I disagree with all the reviews posted about this album. It certainly is not some of the bestguitar music committed to CD, let alone is it totally totally terrible. It's a workmanlike and solid,albeit, derivative set from this American band. In fact, are they all American, because the singersounds very British indeed.Best track by far is the opener 'Nightmare At Noon', very 60s British pop with a gorgeousmelody line and guitar playing. The rest doesn't really match up, and it is not an album I wouldreturn to regularly. It does its job, and thats about it."
5,Rich Sound!! This one will make your sox wobble!,"There is no bad trac on this CD. It is a soulful amalgum of all that was good about the last two decades of Rock n Roll and it provides hope for the next. I've seen these guys in NYC and they fill the room with sound, feeling and people. The Vocals and the song writing are more that just solid. Gee, I guess you can tell by now I liked the CD. Best money I have spent on Amazon.com yet! I hope to hear more from this group in the future. Overmars, Slainthe is saul agat!!"
1,Crappy product,This crossbow string did not look like it had any major problems until it snapped at the endcaps on my third shot. This is very dissapionting for a product rated 5 stars. I am very sure it did not snap of overload from prod because that was the fitting 50 lbs. Dissapointment.
3,Replacement string for 50lb crossbow,The string is great but the plastic end caps shattered the first shot. I eventually got caps for an 80lb crossbow with a little country engineering these work better. But be careful if you do this you will have to use wedging.
5,Exactly as described,"These chips are exactly as described, and work perfectly. No complaints, no confusion, no aggravation. Isn't it great when a description fits perfectly?"
5,"go nuts, try 'em all",stovetop smoking: even the Li'l Smokey can do half a bird or a steak and give you that surprise smokey experience.
1,Nicht Verken,"Chips cannot be made to work with a Holland outdoor grill. I probably ordered the wrong product, but am too spooked to even try the ones advertised for outdoor use."
3,Inappropriate chips,I'm sorry to say I had to return the four types of chips. They were not appropriate for the type of smoker I have. They were designed for another type of smoker and were too finely ground for mine.
2,would not call them chips,"I call them almost dust. Chips that I normally buy are much bigger like potato chip sizes. These are small messy to handle potato flake size. A mess to work with. Did not burn correctly. When I cleaned up after some had not burned at all, which ment lack of smoke. Would not buy again."
4,Smoke in a cup,"You only use a Tblsp but you get huge results! Four types of wood, each with it's own depth of flavor. Easy packageing and easy to use."
4,Not the wood chip sents I normally use.,"The wood chips that came with the smoker with my purchase were prefferable-. Have tried only one, oak, however it was good."
4,Right Right Stuff for the Right Stuff,"Stove top smokers are different than other types of smokers. Camerons makes a stove top smoker, so does Nordicware, so do a few others like Wolfgang Puck. Some stove top smokers plug-in, cause have their own self contained electric element. You can gerry-rig your own stove top smoker out of a wok, a dutch oven, a cast iron pan, or commerical kitchen basins. Emeril Lagasse uses them. The chips for stove top smokers are finely ground. They're also known as shredded wood chips, wood smoke, wood flour, or pulverized wood. There is only a few competitors in this wood product: Smokilicious, True North, Camerons is all I can find. You can also smoke with loose tea leaves/sugar/rice grains. I agree the word ""chips"" on the packaging can be misleading to those who don't know Camerons products."
2,High expectations - but ended up disappointed,"I think the Wire is the most brilliant piece of TV ever. And Pelecanos have received rave reviews here on Amazon, so I thought this must be great. It didn't feel great.I'll start by saying this though: The writing is well done, the conversations sound real, and the story feels believable.However, it took a whole one hundred pages before the story started moving. With that much time building characters, there should be a lot of depth - but it never happens. Ramone and Holiday are pretty one dimensional, and really have only one pattern of expressions. The parallel stories don't have a single character with whom I'd relate or care about what happened to, and thus many chapters felt like a chore to finish. Compared with James Lee Burke's depth or Robert Wilson's plots, this book has a long way to go."
4,Worth a read!,"After watching The Wire I had a hankering for more and thought I would give this book a shot given George's work on it. This isn't your traditional serial killer story. I thought that it was very well done. At times I was a little bit lost as to how everything would tie together, but felt the ending was very fulfilling and did a great job. Definitely recommend."
2,Not that great,"There are times that I have liked George Pelecanos and other times that I haven't. I'm kind of in the middle here. Point of view switched too many times here because I wasn't sure why there was a point of view for one of the characters since he wasn't part of the murder that took place. I think it's good to switch when it's all part of the same story but that wasn't the case here.I think that since this was about a murder mystery about a teenager, then there could have been a lot more on that with one of his friends as a character although I'm not sure I would have liked that either. It's a tough call. I still think that Pelecanos is a great writer and I would still read his other books but this isn't one of his better ones."
3,Interesting But Not Compelling,"I've read three Pelecanos novels, and I always have the very strong sensation that I'm reading a book written by somebody trained in journalism. I don't know if Pelecanos is or was a journalist, but to me his writing is very newspaper-like. That is, it's full of descriptions that aren't really necessary: perhaps they work in a feature article, but I think there are way too many of them for a novel. In a novel, I don't need to and don't want to get the who-what-when-where-why on every page. In a mystery or police procedural I want a compelling story line and I want it, not the descriptions, to dominate the book. In the end, it's the descriptions and atmosphere that dominate this novel and weigh it down. I remember the descriptions and atmosphere way more than I remember the story line."
1,"Good author, poor performer","This is in reference to the audio version of the book: while Mr. Pelacanos can weave a tale, he would be advised stick to the written word and let an actor perform his audio versions. After one CD of his flat, droning delivery, I gave up on the book and will never try another. We cannot all be all things---be gracious enough to know what you do and do not do well."
5,"Strong characters, powerful writing","Pelecanos is one of a handful of writers who doesn't deserve to be called a mystery writer because he's so much more. Mysteries are all about plot--what happens next. Pelecanos's focus is on his characters, and he weaves his stories around their wants and needs. In THE NIGHT GARDENER, the murders are his way of bringing together a host of multi-faceted people and showing us how their lives have been affected by these crimes. It's a compelling way to tell a story, and though some reviewers have complained that this isn't a traditional police precedural with a neatly tied-up ending, I think they're missing the brilliance of this novelist and the world he creates. It's no wonder he was asked to write for HBO's The Wire. He knows how to find high drama in the seemingly mundane."
5,Pelacanos at his best,This is an exceptionally well written and developed novel that takes the reader on a decades long journey of 3 policemen and the effects of 20 year old murders on a present day murder and the lives of those entwined with these cases. This book crackles with first rate dialogue and a believable and realistic story.Highly recommended
4,Ready for more Pelecanos,"Is the case of a teenaged boy, Asa Johnson, who was shot in the head and left in a community garden connected to two unsolved homicide cases from 20 years ago? All three had palindromic names and were murdered in the same manner.Detective Gus Ramone, Doc Holiday, who recently resigned from the police force, and retired detective T.C. Cooke are drawn together on this case. Although the three are very different personalities, they share the same goal. Solve the murders and put away whoever's responsible.The Night Gardener is an enjoyable read, but it is more about characters than plot. This is the first book by Pelecanos that I've read, but I will be reading more of his work."
4,Well worth the $1,"I purchased this book when it was available on Kindle for $1 and it proved to be well worth the price. I had never read Pelecanos before so I wasn't sure what to expect. He weaves many characters into this book in a style more akin to Charles Dickens than crime mystery writers. There were a few times when the violence and details became more than I am accustomed to but I stuck with it and was glad of that. The detective Gus Ramone and the ex-cop Doc Holiday are the driving characters. I actually came to like Holiday more than Ramone as the book progressed because he seemed more alive and less stiff than Ramone. I suspect that I will pick up another Pelecanos book sometime soon because this one made me think and care about the characters and, based on some of the reviews, it isn't even one of his best books."
5,Great non-formulaic murder mystery.....,"Realistic characters and dialog. No ""twists,"" no gratuitous sex, no far-fetched romances. I wish more books simply told a good story like this novel."
4,"Not his best, but still a great read","I have a lot of time for the author. I remember seeing his books advertised as the coolest writer in America, and I can see why.He has a certain flavour to his writing that a lot of writers try to emulate but fall short. He is a writer who is in sync with the people of Washington and he gets their interests and way of life down pat.More than worth a read, possible a must read.This is not his best book as the story does seem to get out of control at times and there are a lot of characters to keep track of, but I would still rank it as one of the best books I have read for a while."
3,"If you watch The Wire, beware: Not as good.","I am a loyal viewer of The Wire since the 1st season. I saw a review for the Pelecanos novel and thought I would see how the screenwriter compares to the author. Sorry to say that I was a little dissapointed. It was still a good read and I finished in three days, but I never got the adrenaline rush I thought was waiting at the end. Characters and plot were fine. The novel is heavy on the issues of fate and tolerance. But Mr. Pelecanos does not deliver the goods chapter by chapter."
3,He has done better,"I have read nearly everything George Pelecanos has written so I am more than a casual fan, however, The Night Gardener, is not his best effort. While Mr. Pelecanos' early work was lean and crackled on the page in the best ""noir"" tradition, The Night Gardener is sedentary. At 372 pages it is probably 50 pages too long. The story, which seemed compelling at the beginning, ultimately left me disappointed. The characters are familiar and seem to be right out of central casting for a police story. The asides about life in DC (mostly negative)are tiresome. On the positive side Pelecanos' ear for dialogue is as good as ever and his knowledge of police and street life seems to be right on. For those looking for a taste of vintage Pelecanos, try ""Shoedog"" or ""King Suckerman""."
3,"gritty, realistic, but lacks heart","The Night Gardener is a gritty, realistic police mystery with edgy dialogue and a real sense of the underside of a city. Unfortunately, the story itself did not engage me. There was no character that I identified with, though I was fascinated by many, especially Gus Ramone, the straight cop who has lost his enthusiasm for the job, but does his best on the job, and as a husband and father. Ramone's relationship with his father is the only one I actually cared about. I listened to the audiobook, read by the author. Pelecanos spoke in a tough-guy monotone, fitting in some way, but not easy to listen to. I can understand why some loved this book. I didn't."
3,hope his other works aren't as confusing,the book was readable but too many characters and too much jumping around. you lose the plot and have to keep going back and re-reading to remember everyone in the story and some of the characters didnt need to be in the story.
2,Worst of one our best,"I might be one of George's biggest fans - I have read every single one of his books... but this one didn't do it for me. Normally when you have three of four differant scenarios happening throughout the book they come together at the end and something magical happens. With this novel, it was three differant stories that had absolutly nothing to do with eachother and at the end I was left thinking, ""what was the point of this book""?"
2,attention to detail sometimes a distraction,"As far as crime dramas go, this is firmly mediocre. The story is okay and requires suspension of disbelief only sporadically, but the author's writing style is sometimes a distraction. Why do the African-American suspects always ask for Slice soda to drink? And they repeatedly make a point of asking for Slice. (Do they even make it anymore? I thought it was replaced by Sierra Mist). And another distracting detail is the author's way of giving so many people nicknames. You don't need to tell me that a guy's name is Ed ""Smiley"" Jones if you never mention ""Smiley"" again or there's not something significant from a story perspective about that nickname. That said, I liked the use of DC as the backdrop and if I was going on a plane ride, I would probably pick up another book by Pelecanos (but I wouldn't let anyone see what I was reading and then I'd leave it in the seatback when I deplaned)."
4,"INTELLIGENT BOOK, GREAT AUTHOR","The Night Gardener is not a cheerful book, you will not feel great after you read it. You will feel satisfied that you have been treated to a book written by a man who CAN write, hold your attention, and cause you to FEEL. Of course, Mr. Pelecanos is one of the writers for the best show on TV, The Wire. This book gives me the same feeling as the show. Entertainment at its best."
4,a competent yet unremarkable crime novel,"'The Night Gardener' is one of those crime novels one would find on a supermarket checkout line. Murder, suspense, and cops trying to find killer(s). Sprinkle in the vulnerability of children, drugs and inner city mayhem. Thankfully 'The Night Gardener' rises over the level of mediocrity because of the author's prose, characterizations, and his obvious knowledge of the subject matter. And so while I will probably forget all about 'The Night Gardener' by tomorrow, at least for today, having just finished it, I will say it was a generally enjoyable read.Bottom line: a mild recommendation for an inferior work by a very skilled author."
4,Stay off the streets at night!,"BEWARE! George Pelecanos is inviting you to enter the streets of Washington D.C. Streets teaming with crime and conspiracy, bigotry and hate, get rich schemes and slow sure death.Follow Gus Rameno's investigation of a teen's death and its possible connection to a series of twenty-six year old murders, and as he unravels that mystery, we watch and listen as the streets throb like a living entity; breathing, fighting, and dying.Every page of this book is thick with the gritty language and acts of those struggling to survive and come to the other side of life richer, wiser, and somewhere else. A thought provoking story, rich in the problems that face us today.Reviewed by Wanda C. Keesey, author of Lost In The Mist (release date May 2008)"
4,"Not quite what it's advertised, but no less great.","Reading this, it's no surprise that Pelecanos ended up writing for The Wire; like that show, The Night Gardener uses the basic framework of a serial killer story to tell a far more compelling tale that looks at its characters, the world they inhabit, and societal trends, all while maintaining an engrossing plot. The bait-and-switch of The Night Gardener is a little frustrating, especially with the off-handed way one of the central mysteries is finally resolved (and the sheer number of questions it leaves unexplained), but the richness of Pelecanos's characters and the intelligent worldview he creates more than make up for the loss of another banal serial killer story. In the end, it's a rich and rewarding police procedural with a lot more on its mind than just action, and as long as you're on board with that, you'll find much here to appreciate and savor."
1,Very Disappointed,"I am currently looking for a new mixer. Mine still works but I get increasingly frustrated with it. This mixer, technically, has six speeds but truly only two -- fast and faster. Be sure and wear protective covering and drape all surfaces in your kitchen ... it splatters everywhere. There is no slower adjustment that can be made and I've tried numerous deeper mixing bowls with no success. I gave it one star because of the price, but I'd rather mix by hand."
3,Dissapointed - Apuesta por un Amor,"While I thorougly enjoyed the telenovela while it was being aired, the DVD is a huge dissapointment. The've edited and cut so many parts of the storyline that it was difficult to follow. Soledad story is completly cut. You barely notice the brother who was such an evil character. To many abrupt jumps. I would definitely not recommend the DVD. If you can find the original telenovela being broadcast I would highly recommend it."
2,telenovela,"Ok. You think you get all of the telenovela that you watched on tv, well you don't. When you watch it on DVD;if you've watched on tv; you can tell where there are parts missing. Thinking I shouldn't have bought it."
1,review,I have not receivd this product yet.What happened? who can i contact to make a complain about this??
3,Apuesta this novela is boring,"this novela is OK. the only worthwhile performances are Alejandra Avalos and Eric Castillo and Fabian Robles. Juan Soler and Paty Manterola are not convincing, but sure tell each like 100 times they love each other , then Paty says I hate you, I'll never believe her acting. Also, there's too much violence, too many characters get killed off. If you can handle that. Fabian Robles is awesome ! He is so wicked fun to watch! Alejandra Avalos is really good, her best role I ever seen her in. Monika Sanchez is good also as Mariposa. So I would recommend it for these actors and actresses, but you might fast forward some scenes."
1,Apuesta por un amor,"The mexican soap opera was one of the best that I have ever seen. While it was being aired I caught about 90% of it. I was so disapointed after I complety watch the dvd in full. It as nearly a third of it cut out. Most of the non critical scenes were deleted. Everything about Julia's sister Soledad was basically deleted. The part where she tries to play it off like she's pregnant by Gabriel was deleted. Everything about here having to choose between Samuel, and Leandro was deleted. Ever thing about Alvaro mis treating Lucero was deleted and just about everything about Lucero and Ramon was cut out. Everything about Julia and Sebastian's almost relationship was deleted. The whole funeral scene where Julia's first son dies is gone. Most of Nadia and Alvaro relationship hardly happend. This was just a huge disapointment for me. Please let me know if there is anywhere where I can get a full length version of it."
5,Great Novela,"I have become addicted 2 the DVD version of telenovelas. This is 1 of my favorites. Great story, the leading actors had great chemistry 2gether. Pretty good editing as well."
3,An amusing glimpse at the private life of an engaging dictator,"This autobiography ""as told to Cindy Adams"" benefits hugely from having been told to a pretty woman, who combined being a tough-as-nails New Yorker with being a female, and therefore not immune to Sukarno's enormous charm. Disarmed by her evident empathy, Sukarno tells more about his real thoughts, feelings and motives than he might otherwise have done in what was, for him, a book designed to woo the West in the waning days of his long and turbulent reign."
4,This is good,"Fastway is ex Motorhead guitarist Eddie Clarke's band, and he was obviously sick and tired of Motorhead's approach since this one is far more polished and radio friendly. The album is good indeed with outstanding songs like the catchy ""Easy living"" (not Uriah Heep cover), ""Feel me, touch me"", and ""Another day"" (the album's hardest rocking track) among others. There's also some good, although not great, solid rock tunes included and you won't find any fillers. Singer Dave King has a good voice but his ""high pitch"" can be a bit annoying in the long run. If I didn't already have this one, I'd get it today. The album is worth either very strong 3 stars, or weaker 4 stars...Anyway, Fastway managed to release another good album with ""Waiting for the roar"" in 1986. But after that they totally lost it. Please don't buy ""On target"" - you'll be so disappointed, I was..."
5,Killer!,"Buy this CD... (wait there's more) Buy this CD, roll down the windows, crank the music up, drive real fast. Fastway is one of the great ""lost"" Metal/Rock bands from the early 80's. There are so many good songs on this CD, it is a shame that rock radio at the time didn't embrace it more. If you are a fan of great blues driven straight forward rock and roll, give the cd a shot."
4,Really good cd,"I used to have this on tape oh so many years ago..finally got it on cd. It's not qutie perfect cd, but has some great hard rockin cuts like give it all you got, say what you will, easy livin, and another day. It's not speed metal but just straight ahead rock."
4,Another awesome 80's band.,Check it out. It is a great album. If you like this one check out Zebra. A couple of rockin' bands that got lost in the 90's.
3,it's led zepplin inspired pop metal,"When fast eddie left motorhead, he hooked up with peteway to form this band. unfortunatly he left the band right after they had cut this album in the studio which left the band w/ out a bassist. this album has atleast 5 great/good songs out of the 11 tracks, which warrents for atleast 3 stars in my book, they are ""easy living"" ""feel me,touch me"" ""all i need is your loving"" ""another day"" and ""say what you will"" the rest of the songs are pure filler. the sad thing is that this band could of been better, they could of been alot heavier if they had tryed. this is an ok cd, but it is really pop metal and would not reccomend it to someone into real heavy metal like motorhead or maiden or any thing like that."
4,Fastway - self-titled (Sony) 4 1/2 stars,"Originally unleashed to the unexpected metal world in 1983,this was the English heavy rocker's first album.Fastway was like one of my all time favorites of the '80's.Never did get their just due.Fastway was made up of two metal/hard rock veterans,Motorhead's guitarist Fast Eddie Clarke and Humble Pie's drummer Jerry Shirley along with bassist Pete Way and under rated vocalist Dave King.Every track on this reissue rules,but the certain ones I could never get tired of were the scorching opener ""Easy Livin'"",""All I Need Is Your Love"",""We Become One""(used to love seeing the video on old school MTV),""Say What You Will"" and ""You Got Me Running"".An absolute must-have for all '80's metal fans.Better,yet an import label BGO Records has reissued this debut CD as a two-lp's-on-one-disc pressing along with their second record 'All Fired Up'.Talk about your worthy releases."
2,"One good song, a lot of schlock.","I bought the album, and I was mistaken. It's mostly very tedious; only one song merits a listen. The rest is nondescript loudness."
3,"Riffs, but no meat.","Fast Eddie is a riffing genius. But sadly, there's no meat to the riffs. The songs are all flat sounding, and it's a let down for those who remembered his work with Motorhead. Getting a Plant wanna-be as a vocalist really hurts them. But if you want riffs, you got it!"
1,Gooossh....,"GOooooshh,.... and to think that Fast Eddie Clarke once was the guitarrist of mighty MOTORHEAD.... And one still wonders why they ""did not became huge""... Almost all metal artists that sold out to make commercial pop metal failed in obtaining any amjor gains. FASTWAY, led by Fast Eddie Clarke, is another of these cases."
4,It is what it says it is..... Resistor values mixed in bags.,"The resistors come in little bags... with several different value resistors in each bag. Since I needed it in a hurry I paid for two day shipping and it showed up on time, that is probably the best thing about this set. Wish I had purchased the Joe-Knows-Electronics set for $20, as there are 3 times as many resistors and each different resistor value has it's own bag. Didn't need the bigger selection of resistors, but having to sort through a bag of (5) different values referring to a chart (not included) to figure out what resistor you are looking at is a pain.Update: I see that some of the later reviewers received each resistor value in it's own bag. That would have been much handier, but the ones sent to me were mixed 5 resistor values to the bag."
5,Very satisfied.,Great price. Great selection of resistors. Handy and organized box with each bag labeled. Would definately purchase this kit again.
4,"was good, only a few were fail","there are a few tiny things i didnt like, but overall this is a perfect product for small diy or projects u are doing!! thanks and delivery was fast!!"
4,A classic logic text,"The text has a first edition that is pre-computer in 1953.At the time this was written the notation ""And"", ""Or"",and ""Xor""wasn't in use: the author uses ""X"" for ""And"" and ""+"" for ""Or"".So in some ways this approach is closer to the algebraicapproach than the modern symbolic version used to teachlogical circuit analysis in electronics.Logic has gone through several changes:1) the syllogistic age of Lewis (Charles Dodgeson) Carroll2) the axiomatic of Russell3) the symbolic calculus of Church and Turing in the 40's and 50's4) the modern version for computersThis treatment appears to ignore the later British approachto some extent, but does a very good job of explainingmost of the theory behind axiomatic logical structure.The result is good readable introduction to logic for beginnersthat doesn't cost an arm and a leg.I think it might do to edit this text with a ""modernization'translation section, so students will be less confused."
2,better than Crashings but not by a lot,"I listened all the way through their first album, and I'm not sure what people's definition of raw rock sound is but this band does not produce that. this band is more pop-punk than it is hardcore. both albums are pretty repetitive and choppy. the song ""symmetry"" got pretty annoying, i had to move on to the next song. ""flights"" is a decent single, but if I had to pick a song to listen to it'd be ""Contact"" because it has more depth and shows more of what the band is capable of. the rest of the songs sound more like renditions of eachother. If u are into a very mainstream rock sound, u may like this. otherwise, I would not suggest this."
2,annoying vocals and decent guitars,his band has pretty good guitar with christian lyrics which is good but the way the vocals sound is annoying
2,Dissapointed...,"What happened with this band? The fifth and last song are technoish songs that sound horrible. And the rest of the CD is just, I don't know, not that good. I mean, the CD as a whole isn't crap, but they've just lost their touch. I like the piano the fact that the piano is emphasized in this CD(like the second song is cool) but the guitars seemed to take a big drop. They just don't have, as I said before that touch. I mean, I really tried to like this album, but I jsut couldn't. I totally recomend their first album, Crashings."
3,I don't listen to much Christian music,"I'm not sure how Falling Up sounds in comparison to other Christian bands, so I'm writing this review from the perspective of an ordinary music fan.From start to finish, Dawn Escapes is a Christian homage to the status quo of contemporary rock music. i.e.: The same songs you've heard before with a different message. The album as a whole has a highly produced feel to it, and a few tracks (Moonlit in particular comes to mind) sound like they were written just to be played on rock radio. There's nothing new here, but nothing bad either.The band is very talented, and there is a hopeful/uplifting message in their words. But you may be disappointed if you're looking for something distinctive."
1,"Sounds Good, until the Singing Starts....","This band I have tried to listen to more than once and I have to say that the vocalist cannot sing! I disagree with most people you say that he has notes and tone...he does not, plain and simple! This is the worst singer I have ever heard. The music itself is marginal. The lyrics are boring and meaningless."
2,Meh,"Honestly, in the last...i felt there were 2 solid songs that capture my attention. it was not something that i would listen to, all the way through. this cd is basically the same feeling. sure they belt it out sometimes but the fact is, both albums combined i cant tell which song is which, because they all start the same, they all end the same, the riffs are fairly similar, falling up is a semi good band, but they have no diversity is their writing what-so-ever. Its the same old thing over and over. there are two songs that chourses are the same from the first album and this album. the versitility is lacking and substance is just not there, it sounds over produced, and not so much that raw rock feel that the first album had. hope to hear some better work in the future from these guys. next time try writing a song that isnt in Dropped-D."
3,"Strong album, good songwriting","I wasn't into Falling Up until I saw them live. I was an instant fan! What a great show by some amazing young musicians. ""Dawn Escapes"" is a very solid album wtih some very bright moments. But, there are times where some of the songs kind of bleed together... just not a lot of difference sonicly. But, that's to be expected from a young band who is still discovering themselves and developing their sound. I would recommend you purchase this album and see what these guys are all about... Great hooks, hard guitars, layered synths and pointed lyrics.Top Tracks: Searchlights, Exit Calypsan"
5,WOW!,"I am a huge fan of Falling Up. Their first CD ""Crashings"" is one of my all time favorite albums. That being said, this CD is every bit as good as the debut album. Blending elements of pop, rock, electronica and hard rock, Falling Up brings everything to the table, and you won't want to leave until the dishes are taken."
5,We LOVE Animal Planet,"My 2 1/2 year old LOVES sharks, but because of this bucket he became familiar with other sea life. He quickly learned about dolphins, whales, octopus, and fish. This is such a great bucket!! It has such a good variety of sea life and all made out of heavy duty materials. They're great for the tub or for outside in the pool. I was so impressed at how quickly he learned the difference between a shark and a dolphin or a shark and a whale. If your little one is interested in any kind of sea life, then this bucket is perfect. And the price just can't be beat!!"
2,not what was in the picture,"I was VERY disappointed. The bucket should have included ALL of the items in the photo, however all you get are 6 things! My son really wanted the octopus and squid and they were NOT included! Why show a picture of things that aren't included? I would have never ordered it if I had known that! Thanks for wasting my time and money and making my son think he was getting something he really wanted and then being totally let down. This is total crap! I should be sent the rest of the items in the photo instead of getting a refund! I am never ordering from this place again!!"
5,Veggie Tales: Worship songs,Another great Veggie Tales product! You just can't lose with this company.
5,Good songs!,"This is a fun CD to listen to, I usually put it on in morning on the way to church and my daughter really gets into it (she is two) I am actually able to enjoy the songs and not get annoyed by the veggie voices, as with some childrens albums you get irritated by whoever is singing, at least I do... But this is a little better and I love Veggie Tales myself anyways, so its a lot of fun!"
1,Like a bad home movie.,"I hate home movies because they tend to be poorly thought out and the subject matter is usually something solely of personal interest to the people shooting the film. This is how I would describe this first CKY piece. It's not particularly funny, violent or disgusting (which is what I hope for in a CKY dvd). Way too many random clips of mediocre skating and fifteen year olds throwing a tantrum when they fail to complete a trick. Skip this one."
5,So Funny,"Simply put, if your a fan of Bam Margera and his crew your going to love this. And if you dont then why are you looking at this to begin with."
5,CKY Landspeed,"From the makers of Jackass , and the video Haggerd , this is the best video i've seen from them yet !Emence Skating and death deafing stunts it's worthy of a 5 out of 5 rating.waz 2k3"
5,hilarious,"this dvd is the funniest movie u will ever see. the prank calls and mcdonalds drive thrus make this dvd so funny. even if u hate stunts and skateboarding, buy this just for the prank calls and mcdonalds drive thrus. u will laugh every time u watch them."
3,"Nice, small design, but could be more useful","A small-footprint CD/cassette player is nice, but rather passe in this day and age, particularly for $200+. This model would've been so much better (given the same form factor) with a DVD player instead a CD player. (I know there are other DVD micro systems, but none nearly as micro as this one.)And who listens to cassettes anymore? Certainly not me. Dump the tape player and save me some money. Use the space for something useful, such as the aforementioned DVD video subsystem or some nice durr-brown DACs to improve sound.In short, give me something worth replacing my old radio. Are you listening Sony?"
3,Surprisingly entertaining,"I watched this movie on the recommendation of my daughter and was pleasantly surprised by how entertaining it was. Andre Braugher was terrific as was Paul Giametti. However, the subplot with the cabdriver and the foul mouthed Suzy wasn't believeable and didn't add anything to the movie. I could have done without those characters altogether. The duet with Paul Giamatti and Andre Baugher was wonderful and Gwenyth can really sing, another pleasant surprise. Her character's relationship with her father, played by Huey Lewis, was rather strange, but all in all a pleasant movie."
3,"This movie had heart, but not much else",The performances in this movie where bad but so is karoke so who now's maybe they were supposed to be.I think the Maria Bello and cabby relationship was really the only weak one of all the four pairs.This movie get's 3 star cause it could have been better but then again it could have been a lot worse. Ps I still can't believe Gwyneth could sing
3,Introduced me to Paul Giamatti,"And this alone made it worthwhile. As much as I hate to admit it, I liked most of the music, too."
5,Duets,It's nice to watch a movie that's not full of violence. This is a nice heartwarming movie. would watch again
4,Worth Watching,"I had heard/watched several of the songs from the movie Duets on YouTube, and decided to watch the entire movie. Paul Giamatti steals the show with his performance as a salesman who has had enough of the grind. The plot told from the point of view of Giamatti and Andre Braugher is a bit ""off the beaten path"", and their relationship is a strange one, but the acting is solid. Huey Lewis and Gwyneth Paltrow have their own set of problems, as do another pair of leads in the movie.All in all, Duets is worth watching if you enjoy listening to/watching karaoke and want a plot to supplement it."
4,Great Music,"This was one of my favorite movies. Unlike one other reviewer, I'd say this is one to watch more than once ..... like listening to a good album many times. I thought the story was decent, but the music is what really made the movie. Much like the music made Dirty Dancing (another of my all time favs). I also thought Mario Bello did a great rendition of ""I Can't Make You Love Me"". This is well worth buying."
2,I was bored...,"I really thought that I'd like this movie judging by the previews and commercials, but I really was just bored with this movie. I couldn't really feel anything for any of the characters. this is probably because they jump arounnd between 3 different sets of characters and don't really give you an actual chance to get to know the characters and like them. but my biggest gripe about this movie is how UNREALISTIC the karaoke scenes are. NOBODY just walks into a karaoke bar and starts singing when there is a contest going on... especially when cash prizes are involved. Is more like: turn in your request and wait for another hour or two while all the contestants who showed up before you sing. In this movie, the characters just walk into the bar and the next second they are singing already... yeah right! I hate to nitpick, but be realistic."
1,booo!,I thought it looked good because it was a Gwyneth Paltrow movie. I had heard it was bad so i didnt see it in the theater. I rented it. I almost turned it off in the middle because it was so terrible. This movie should be on your never see list. Kids should not see it eaither.
3,Not a very good Plot filled with Decent Performances,"Why would anyone make a movie about Kareoke is beyond me, and that is what Duets is about. A bunch of [down and outs] who love Kareoke...it's even a dream for some of them. The terrific ensemble do what they can with the boring premise and make it semi interesting. Gywneth paltrow surprisingly is the standout as she portrays an 18 year old who meets her estranged father for and accompanies him to the Kareoke contest. Paul Giamatti and Andre Braugher are fantastic as a duo who hit the road together and have wonderful chemisitry on screen, and Scott Speedman from Felicity is very charming as a down on his luck taxi driver. However each scene drags the because of the bad direction and silly dialogue. Overly long and taken too seriously. I was hoping for more of a movie that was similiar to the kareoke scene in My Best Friends Wedding. This movie is nothing like that. For hardcore kareoke fans and Gwyneth fans only!"
2,For the most part... sour talent & plot,"This is one of those movies you will want to watch only once. There was so much potential for the story line and comedy, but it appears somewhere along the line everyone just got lazy. The only worthy converse is between the father and daughter. Huey Lewis, Gwyneth Paltrow and Arnold McCuller's acting and talent were great, but everyone else really lacked. Especially Maria Bello's, which I was really surprised that she was cast to sing since she has no talent and her voice just made you want to turn off the volume. There is a ton of holes in the story line and talent with this one. Save this for a rainy, bored day or skip it all together...."
1,One star is indeed one too many,"Take a stupid, utterly implausible script filled with one-dimensional characters and really bad dialogues. Add some pathetically bad singing and over-the-top acting for a good measure. What do you get? The answer: Duets. This is by far the worst movie I've seen in the past year or two."
5,"Really, its a good movie!","Wow - I am kinda suprised at the intense dislike expressed so far about this movie. This movie was exactly what it set out to be - a fun diversion from life. The vocal abilities of the actors fit perfectly with the setting and the characters were interesting.Was it the best movie of the year, nah - and it didnt set out to be. There should be a place for movies which are just fun to watch. Hey, all I know is I walked out of the theatre with a big smile on my face. I felt much better than I did walking in. What more can you ask for in a movie?I immensely enjoyed this film."
4,American Idol?,"I saw this movie only after buying the sountrack. The song Cruisin' attracted me and I had to buy the whole CD to get the one song. When I eventually saw the film, I liked it more simply because I was already familiar with the music. If I didn't know the songs, I may not have liked to movie as much because Karaoke and stars-in-the-eyes wannabe crooners in the boondocks don't really inspire me. Overall, I enjoyed it - certainly more than watching American Idol, the only other show I can compare it to in terms of showcasing aspiring performers."
3,Ok,"This ensemble film about several people on their was to a large Karaoke contest in Omaha is fairly good. Gwyneth Paltrow is terribly miscast and not very believable. Huey Lewis is surprisingly good as her father the karaoke hustler. The other two couples are a bit strange and unbelievable, but the movie overall, is pretty enjoyable. I am glad I rented it and didn't spend alot to see it in the theater"
5,otis redding would be proud,"when paul giamatti and andre braugher sing ""try a little tenderness"", i feel my smile lifting me higher and higher. this duet is such a delightful surprise as the singers share the joy of discovering each others kindred spirits in song. the smiles they exchange as each hits the songs sweet spots dead on is really wonderful to behold. giamatti and braugher achieve some great chemistry on screen, a sweetness and indeed, a tenderness, that is rarely seen. these two men from diametrically opposed backgrounds, grow to love each other and the freedom that each grants the other to be who they really are. gwyneth and huey also sing sweet but paul and andre are, for me, the heart of this overlooked gem. see it, listen to it and feel your smile take you higher."
4,Duets the DVD,"I really liked this DVD. Huey Lewis and Gwyneth Paltrow sing so well together. All the duets where great, who knew that a movie about karaoke would be so good. Would definitely recommend it."
5,Rebel Rock at its very best,"Almost everyone will agree that the Charlie Daniels Band is a country group, but they've had more than their share of success on the rock charts. This album will make fans of either musical genre smile and tap their toes, or maybe stomp their feet.Charlie's agressive fiddle work is the driving force behind the group's biggest hit, ""The Devil Went Down to Georia."" Right behind that one come's the rebellious, amusing tale of ""Uneasy Rider.""The group's unabashed patriotism is featured in ""In America"", and their southern heritage brought forth in ""The South's Gonna Do It Again."" There are several other solid cuts included in the collection.The Charlie Daniels Band - A Decade of Hits is hard-driving music that will make you want to get up and dance, or at least stand up and holler. Either way, this disc is a party waiting to happen."
4,Too bad Charlie's music is better than his views.,"The music is always good. That said, the man has no morals. If you disagree with him he bans you from his website. Real petty. Censureship is alive in the south."
2,You get what you pay for,"You get what you pay for. For $50, you have a receiver and 2 mics. Build was impressive, case looked sturdy, documentation was in English.Originally purchased to add a karaoke type singalong to a DJ setup for tailgate parties. For this I figured, if it broke no biggie. Well, that's what happened. When they worked, they were great, only problem is they lasted less than a year. All of a sudden one channel developed noise on the input and essentially rendered that one mic useless. So now its a single channel.Called Nady and they admitted that to fix it and with shipping would cost more than the unit is worth and to purchase a more expensive one next time. They never heard of the noise problem and wouldn't elaborate beyond that. So buyer beware, you get what you pay for. If you're going cheap with the intent of replacing it, you will sooner than later."
2,Not up to specs.,"While these mics did pick up sound and broadcast (most of) it back to the receiver, the overall quality was not good and certainly not what is advertised in the product specs. I got these for a wedding reception and had to switch over to wired mics halfway through the event due to frequent dropouts, interference and hissing, and very limited range (about 50' at best, even with fresh batteries and the receiver positioned in a clear overhead position in a large, open room)."
4,Good mic for price,"Just got this item, plugged it into my PA. Works great at a fair price. When you handle the mic it brings the sound over the speakers a bit but its not that bad. I plan on getting a covering to slide over the mic to help prevent more of this. Range on the wireless is fair, about 100 feet before it begins to cut out. Seems that one moc goes another 25 feet before it begin to cut out. Remember, you get what you pay for and this wireless mic is fairly priced and works well. Minor issues, but nothing you can't work around."
5,A Fantastic Product.,"To me, the item deserves a five star rating for quality and pricing. I play in a small band and we were in need of good microphones and then I found the Naty wireless mikes. For the price, I couldn't have found a better product. Since the first of December (2012), we've used it 10 times at various gigs, and so far, no squeals, drop outs or noise from other signal that may try to jump in to our frequency. This is an awesome product for anyone who require wireless microphones that are high in quality, but doesn't cost an arm or a leg (or two). I highly recommend Nady DKW Duo."
5,I bought and I loved it,"I love it, for me it was the best instrument I've bought, the quality sound is perfect and the image to. the thing that I liked most was the image, the price is accessibly.I recommend it for all."
5,wow....,"ordered this bad boy because of all the positive reviews and of course the price and two channel mic's, I ordered them on tuesday they arrived Thursday, used them @ xmas party Saturday and I must say they were great....I was able to dj the party and pump the crowd with very little interference .......love these....get them u wont be disappointed......DJ Heat....."
5,Great value!!!,"So, for a very low price you get two wireless MICs from a reputable company. It works well for the hobby and smaller mobile DJ rigs. Sounds good and distance can vary from 20 to 30 ft depending on environment. I have seen worse units for double the price."
1,Mine didn't work,"Sometimes you take the risk of getting a defective product when you don't want to pay much, and that's what happened here. Simply put, the one I got does not work. I managed to get a little sound out of it when I turned up the volume on my speaker system to a maximum level and also turned up the volume to maximum on the included receiver unit. I checked this system with a few other speaker systems and got the same result. Just to make sure, I also had my friend look at it who records music for bands for a living. He told me it is screwed and I should send it back, however, I was stupid and threw away all the packaging. He also told me that this is what I should expect for the price, and that any decent wireless mic setup will cost three times as much just to start."
5,Excellent,"We use these for KARAOKE hooked them up to the home stereo and they worked great, TIP if you are in a small area the receiver box needs to be out of view like in the next room or behind a wall or shutter, to block some of the waves (if thats what you call it) they work great"
4,very good sound quality & coverage - pleasantly surprised..,"My kids have been using it for about 2 weeks now. very good sound quality, and the coverage is very well.. the base feels flimsy / very lightweight but that has no effect on the outcome.. My daughter is having tons of fun with it.. and so is my Son who sings Girl is on Fire very loud - not good, I tell you.. (I wish I could attach a sound file here..)Dont forget to buy two 9volt batteries. Luckily, I also had an old sony amplifier with mic jack input which you will need.. read & think about that before purchasing so you are not surprised..I'm happy with my purchase."
2,Decent mic setup if both worked,"I bought this set as it was affordable and seemed to have some decent reviews. I received the setup and like several others had commented only one of the microphones worked. The other mic was doa, and still will not work. Maybe they should just sell it as a single mic instead of a dual. On the bright side the one that does work works very well. There is no feedback and the range is very good."
1,Poor Quality,"One of the two I bought didn't work correctly right out of the box. The units are cheaply made, but if you only need it to make speeches (not for music) they are an inexpensive option."
3,enter title here,"you definitely get what ya pay for with these things. u want to pay nothin, u get nothin. these mics are not for serious musicians. they are perfect for doing anything else. just having fun, karaoke, or block party, these are the best price for the job. but if ya doin a show or something similar, then go with the mics that cost a lil more"
3,Not bad for the price,"I bought these for my 8 year old daughter. For $39.95, what do you expect? I think they worked great and proformed well. If you are a professional, this isn't for you. If you are doing karaoke at home, have kids who enjoying singing, then these are for you. My mics died after a year, however, my kids took them apart. I'm buying another set if that tells you anything. :D"
1,Only worked for 2 gigs. Range was AWFUL,I bought these a couple months ago. I used them for 2 gigs. First gig was OK as it was just me talking. 2nd gig was no good. One of the mics is dead and the range is only 15 to 20 feet. At about 10 feet they drop off and get static. I keep them in the box and take care of them. I used the 10 dollar durecell batteries and buy them before each gig. This was embarassing. I had a cerimony where the transmitter was no more than 15 feet from the reciver and the pastor doing the wedding was droppin out BAD! Only about 1/2 the cerimony worked. When the mic was used for the Vows the bride had zero reception and everything she said was NOT heard! Its deadly when you have a paid gig and things do not work! So i am going back to the good ol long mic cords. More stable. I may even invest in a real mic such as sure or EV. You get what you paid for. Its not worth sending back as im sure shipping will be as much as the unit costs!
3,broken microphone switch,Unit comes with 2 hand held microphones.One of the microphones had a defective on/off switch.Sent the defective microphone back for a replacement.Would have rated it 5 stars except for poor quality control.
2,Dissapointed,"I purchased this product with hopes that this would be a reliable mic. I must say that I am not happy with it. It cut off from the first event and on. I used fresh batteries and even tried out ther mic and had the same issue.It's only 50 bucks and may just use it for when I do my restuarant shows but would not use for a wedding that features toasts, etcI will def be looking for a more reliable wireless mic option"
4,Excellent,Excellent product. The only downside is the windscreen is easily damaged and there is no replacement. I have 4 sets of these and I am very pleased.
2,Disappointed,"I read the reviews, and decided to take a chance. $50 wasn't a bad price.Sadly, It just didn't work.Tried using this for our Cub Scout system, and I couldn't even move 50ft from the base, before I started to have issues.Then the volume output is just so low (even on max), that the Amp had to be cracked up to more than 75% power just to hear it in a small conference room.First time I have ever returned something to Amazon."
4,Duo wireless microphones,"These Nady wireless mics are great for parties where yo do not have to worry about how the guests treat them. Not on par with seinhauser or other higher priced microphones, but for the money they are great"
5,good and cheap,bought for $50 and dropped several times and no problems with them. range is good and power switch is better. good for dj but not karaoke because there is only 2
5,Bang for the buck!,Just used this mic at an event last week. 6 days out in the middle of nowhere with 70 guys at an annual charity event. A tad bit of feedback at higher levels but they were very easy to use with no problems at all. We used them about 4 hrs each day. Great value!
3,Pick something Else!,"I'm a DJ and was in need of some wireless mics for my clients, after using these cheap NAXA products, I decided on these NADY after reading good reviews here and on guitarcenter.com. I tested them this saturday at a event and lets just say only one mic functioned well the second mic was hit and miss, It worked when it wanted too. This would;ve been a great mic had it been a single unit, so if you're in need of only one, this is your choice."
4,Works as expected.,I bought this pair of mics to have a backup for my shows. I already owned a pair of these mics and they have always work well.It's a good choice for the price.
2,Audio cutting-out...would up returning,"I didn't have an issue with the sound; when it worked, the sound was clear. I had issues with the mics cutting out -- even when I was right in front of the base. This is why I am not a fan of wireless mics because many factors can interfere with reception. Even more now that everyone & their pet seem to have a wireless device on them. But then again, this is a VHF wireless, too. I thought it sounded good, but I wound up returning it because of the unreliability."
3,Budget watching demands,"Many reviews are based on peculiar tastes. Hook-up, environment and operation seem contributive to the varying results. Bearing in mind, the cost is very friendly for anyone without higher-end needs. Good for for the convenience of two cordless in the house."
2,Not worth your money.,"I bought this product a few weeks ago and i am very dissapointed with it,First of all, one of the microphones only work for a very short time,I put new Duracell batteries and still would'nt work,The other one worked fine but now is also making loud funny noises,I was thinking of sending them back to Amazon but it'll cost more of shipping than what they're worth.Maybe it was just a defected set.Good luck if you purchase them!!!"
1,Cheap VERY Cheap,One antenna broke taking it out of the box. The other broke shortly thereafter. Very cheap construction. Threw mine way.
3,Died After a Year,"Bought these from Musician's Friend and the base unit died after about a year. No power whatsoever. Prior to that, it works great. I was able to go upstaire and it can still pick up clearly."
2,Entry Level Microphone,"I purchased these as an inexpensive replaceme3nt for my VocoPro Cordless Microphones. In my opinion, unless you are broke and desparate, save your money. These microphones are cheaply made and cut in and out, and my Karaoke customer avoid them if possible."
1,Junk,I have had these for a couple months and have not yet gotten them to work. I have plugged them into 2 different receivers and also to an FM transmitter. I can get a little sound if I crank the volume way up but definitely not what was expected. They are simple enough to connect so I can only come to the conclusion that the ones I got were junk.
4,Great for the price !!,I rather pay less than 100 than more than 400 for a wireless microphone system.I agree with most reviewers that this will do the job in most cases like signingkareokee or with friends....its a great musical time waister.There is some feedback depending how your system is setup....just move the unitaround ...nothing that cant be ajusted..so for the money i spent on this....... i love them
2,Lots of Feedback noise,"First of all the receiver was not new the display had scratches, the microphones sounded ok but there was too much feedback noise and the signal would drop constantly.I returned them and will buy another brand."
3,Not Impressive,The quality of the mic wasn't what I expected/desired. I ended up returning the set so I could purchase another wireless set.
4,Microphones,Pretty good quality. Once in a while one mic works better than the other but overall for the price it was pretty good.
4,Serving it's purpose,"My 10 year old daughter loves to sing and she loves Karaoke off The computer. This is perfect for her and her friends and especially being wireless she can move about the room, or use her new Mic Stand.....Fits our needs just fine."
4,Nady DKW Wireless Mikes,"These are working very nicely. However, one microphone audio channel has a tinnier sounding output, so when doing a broadcast there is a noticeable difference. Otherwise am pleased for the price."
2,Home Electronics Survival Guide,"Helped a little, but did not give me enough info to hook up my LCD TV. I got it hooked up by a mixture of thinking a lot and trial and error.The book does give a good basic discussion of modern TV systems. I forgot what I paid, but it's worth a few books just to get this discussion and the illustrations, but it won't get you to the Promised Land by itself!!"
5,LOVELY,"I got no clue whether a Hong Kong-produced latest DVD is this Amazon-presented disk being reviewed, that produce depicting a string of videos and a live concert in which dancing around a singer, semi-naked men performed in Cantonese something rather native American-Indian, but matured Jay is much better than a sexy birdie he was when stormed a podium years ago."
3,unsatisfied customer,I ordered the Bell with the year 2012 to be on it. it was just a plain Bell with no engtaving. was very dissappointed.
3,"Well, every author has to write a first novel...","Kennedy's Albany Cycle of novels is a remarkable acheivement by any standard. This, his first novel, is not part of the Albany Cycle of novels, and it's not remarkable, either.The book is the story of the late stages of a newspaper strike from the point of view of Bailey, a striking writer. As the strike unravels, so does Bailey. As his actions become increasingly disconnected from reality, the reality he experiences becomes increasingly surreal.One can see the future, mature Kennedy at work here, but the book is ultimately unsatisfying. I guess that's no real surprise; after all, every writer-- even great writers-- has to go through a first novel on his or her way to greatness. It's not realistic or even fair to expect a first novel to be great. This one isn't."
4,Why I purchased this book,"This book was recommended to me from a Church member who has been visiting me and my daughter during a very rough time in our lives. Since it is a book written by women for women I decided to purchase one for us. Although we don't read it daily, we have found it has some wonderful passages for anyone who needs a little extra support during difficult times."
3,grindhouse horror,"a bit cheese, but if you like Hershell Gordon Lewis, you'll enjoy this film. It is a disturbing film for sure, especially for its time."
1,Please Rent don't buy,Horrible Horrible please don't buy. Not worth the time to tell you how bad this movie really is.
4,"His music takes you for a ""Wild Ride""","My favorite track on this CD is ""In Your Heart"". As I've recently started listening to smooth jazz, I'm making sure that this and other CD's of Bill Evans are in my collection!"
1,does not work,"i got the phone and does not work, i have to go to TIGERDIRECT in order to change it and the new one doesn't work !!! i got the 3rd one and is working, i don't know for how long !! ...."
4,I don't understand!,"I've been wanting a cosmic blue razr for quite some time... i'm getting one, but i don't get it. when u look at the photos at the top of the page the first one looks lighter that the last pic on the right... wuts wrong with it??? i also read that one kid got one that looked more like a midnight blue than cosmic also."
5,The phone to have,"I work for a very well respected cell phone company, and I purched this phone from this very page back on May 2, 2006. Being unlocked, I can use any company's SIM I need to. While the reception is not tuned for my particular network, I have yet to miss a call, and it is simply the nicest feeling, holding, fliping, opening, using phone ever, and I test over 40 phones a year."
1,Good for about six months/no customer service,"After about six months the phone would no longer charge. After calling customer service I was instructed to mail it to them in a very specific way that cost me about twelve dollars. I was told 14 days was the longest they would keep the phone. After 21 days and countless hours on the phone during which time they could never find the phone they overnighted me back the phone untouched in a flimsy paper mailer and told me that it had water damage. The phone had no water damage, they simply never entered the phone in their system, did not want to do what they were supposed to do and overnighted it back to me to save themselves. Please think long and hard before purchasing anything from Motorola they will not support their warranty."
1,Phone defective,The blue razr is defective. It would not pick up any kind of signal. I sent it back to them at my expense and they sent me an email later saying that the manufacturer is recalling them.
1,CHECK THE WARRANTY SMALL PRINT,"Purchased this phone in May, 2006. Less than one year later, it ceased to function (would not hold a charge). Purchased replacement battery, that did not fix the issue. Called Motorola to send to them under warranty claim (manual notes a one-year warranty) and was told (after they looked up the serial number) that the item was not manufactured in the US and it is not covered under a Motorola warranty! SPEND THE EXTRA MONEY AND BUY A WARRANTEED ITEM!"
4,Great piece of technology!!!,The phone as a whole is wonderful. The color is as unique as the phone itself. Blue ones are rare and i get compliments all the time. Do realize the reception of this phone is sub par of industry standard. Yet it makes up for its flaw in style and features.Invest in one and you'll agree its worth it. Make sure service is available and talk to people that have the service to see which carrier provides best service. Overall great phone!!!!
3,Black and Blue,"I ordered a Cosmic Blur Razr v3,but I got a Black RAZR. I emailed them and they are going to credit me $25. I'd rather have the blue, but I don't want to send it back and have to wait all over again."
3,hookup,"was able to replace with out new contract, after my phone broke. needed a cheap replacement . didn't want to pay ridiculous price from cell company"
3,Blue is cool,"I got this phone from Amazon because they were a reliable merchant.I had a Blue Razr before which I had to send back because the language was set on Asian characters. This Phone makes other cell phones look average. Plus it has all the features you could ask for in a phone. And I have yet to experience a dropped call. The cons are, if you have big hands you may have trouble dialing or operating the phone, being that the phone is so thin and light weight. Other than that I wish the ear phone volume was a little bit louder. And also this is an unlocked phone which means that you can use any carrier that uses the GSM network. Just add a SIM card from your favorite carrier and go."
4,friggin coo,"It's a good phone. I got what I paid for. I still wish I had my SLVR...but it is dead now. RIP. All in all, it is good quality and was shipped ok. The only thing I take issue with is that by the time it shipped with 2nd day air, I still had to wait something like 4 days to get the phone. I may as well have saved my money and shipped it ground. Oh well, I guess I'll know better next time."
5,Magic Sam's West Side Soul is a classic!!!,"This guy was, in my opinion, the most gifted blues guitarist to ever walk the earth. He only cut two albums before dying at 32, but West Side Soul is a definitive Chicago Blues album. This particular album has heart-felt deep blues feeling to it. Magic is a slashing type guitarist with incredible range. He's also a great vocalist. I strongly suggest that any serious blues fan buy this album. If you want real Chicago Blues by one of the originals, this is a good place to start."
3,Case okay...,"This alluminium case is good protection, but it is bulky & there is no place to store additional games/movies like the softer cases. Those are my only complaints"
4,Great for Offices Patios or Backyards,I just ordered this for our office balcony. So far it looks nice and we haven't had any problems with it. I would recommend buying sand the same time you buy this product so you can set it up all at once. VERY EASY ASSEMBLY!
4,This item sure looks a whole lot better than the bucket with sand we were using.,The only problem we have had is that it does blow over. That is what happens when you live in an area with lots of wind.
1,Not for commercial use,I purchased one of these and the steel plastic ones. This was after 2 years was falling apart. Probably great at someones home without a huge amount of smokers. It fell apart and then people started throwing butts on the ground again.
5,Made in USA,"What a great product! Our board of director's Treasurer is a smoker but she was getting fed up with all the cigarette butts piling up by the gate to the association's swimming pool. She controls the money and when she tells me, the Prez, to do something I hop to it. I found this beauty after shopping locally at 8 different stores that used to sell such products, of course they don't anymore. I got this a day earlier than I expected and it was a snap (literally) to put together. Plus, it's made in the USA. Win-win-win all the way around."
4,Smokers Outpost,Item works great. Tends to be on the light side so you will need to weigh it down with sand or rocks. Great for use on the patio or near any outside work area. Very slim design just blends in with it's surroundings. Only shortcoming is the lightness of the product.
4,A lifesaver for whomever kept choosing to throw cigs by the pool,"Yes, there are work associates invited to my home once or twice a year to lounge in the pool... and these receptacles saved there life. Well, not really, but it kept them from seeing me go all ""Spark-Zilla"" on them. Ashtrays I guess were just not attractive enough for them. But, since I put two of these out back, I haven't found another errant half burned cigarette but. Plus, they don't look bad at all. (I may add sand to them though, as they are lighter than one would expect.)They were so easy to put together, I thought I may have not done it right. You just pop the top on and it stays. Guests think it is professional, fancy and cool, so they seem eager to use it! Mission accomplished."
3,Works fine,"I purchased this for a family member who smokes. It works fine. I don't know if I would put it in a commercial grade category. It is really light weight. After it blew away several times, we putting gravel in the bottom to hold it down. Other than that it works fine."
1,"avoid, unless you live in a trailer park","feels like a cheap piece of chinese molded plastic. inside is a small tin bucket for the butts, whole contraption is hard to open and close, its done by snapping the top and bottom piece. will throw away when its full with butts."
5,My Plastic Cigarette Thing,It's a great product. It is out of the way and made our apartment complex much nicer looking. I recommend it.
2,"Nice seller, not so nice item","The top and the bottom plastic parts are supposed to snap together. Well, the bottom piece was bent and not symmetrical, even though it seemed to have been well packaged. I could not put it together myself, and I am not a weak lady. My guy friends tried and it took some serious muscle. But then we could not open it! It unsnapped with even more effort. We pictured having to go through this much trouble to open this receptacle full of cigarette butts and decided to get a different model.Seller was extremely nice, though. Refunded the money very quickly. I would buy from them, just not this receptacle!"
2,"This book was at times bizarre, disturbing, and ridiculous.","I found this book to be bizarre. The stories that Brubacker relates are frankly very difficult to believe. Perhaps the most disturbing part of the story is the change that occurs in this man's life due to his heart attack. His life goes from being relatively normal to totally NDE and spiritially oriented, but spiritualality with a bizarre twist, including the so-called ""red eye"", which sounds more like a character from a poorly written episode of the ""X-Files"". But I did find myself thinking about this book a lot after I had read it. I think this was primarily because I believe that ""something"" happened to this man, it is just hard to believe that the ""something"" is what is related in this book."
5,"Love this game, but...","Our family loves this game, but the only drawback is that this is the Canadian version of the updated cards. Many times, we pulled out a card that made absolutely no sense to us, simply because the answers pertained to something that was so specifically Canadian. I am ashamed to admit that we do not know more about our closest neighbors to the north, but there it is. Otherwise, on the upside, we do learn a lot about Canadian culture, and some French to boot, as we go through the cards. So, this game is fairly educational."
3,Fun group game if you can get really creative.,"I played Outburst growing up and really enjoyed it. It's a great game for a group of people. Growing up, we played the origional edition, and the categories really were dated (I'm not THAT old!). We always joked that the game is made in California (which it is) because the answers to the questions were sometimes very odd and obscure. Well, for this one, don't expect too much better. The categories are updated maybe by a decade which is fine, but the answers are still very ""Californian"". Great game, just don't expect to get 10 out of 10 answers every time!"
4,Great Insights!!,"I really enjoyed Dr. Ingersoll's book. As an educator who worked primarily in Spec. Ed and encountered ADHD/ADD kids in the regular and special ed classroom settings and a parent of an 11 yr. old with ADD, I particularly appreciated her expanding the very clinical statements of the DSM-IV into very human recognizable examples. As a professional educator and a parent this book worked for me; it was interesting to look at how much our knowledge of ADD and related disorders has grown over the past decade."
3,Good for those without prior computer experience,"By the time I bought this book, I'd already figured out for myself the majority of the topics that this book discusses. It would, clearly, be a wonderful aid to those who had no prior computer experience whatsoever...but for those of us who've spent years working in a DOS/Windows environment, you will find yourself flipping past scores of chapters dealing with basic computing concepts. As I said, it is an excellent source of information for those who need very basic assistance but I would not recommend this book for anyone who considers themselves highly knowledgable about computers in general."
1,Every day fantasies grow larger,"It is unbelievable. Penthouse Letters has become hte number one Fantasy exhibition in the United States and abroad. The collection becomes more and more fantasy oriented instead of reality oriented. It is a terrible book. Don't bother, by far the worse in the entire series"
3,Came up a little short,"Based on the reviews I was expecting a little more. The battle scenes in particular fell short of the best writers of historical fiction, such as Cecilia Holland. But perhaps that's because they're seen through the eyes of Caesar, who would of necessity be detached from the action in the lines. I was not aware of the extent to which (if this is historically accurate) the generals themselves had to finance their legions. Certainly calls into question the stated reasons for their campaigns, since they also needed to keep turning a profit. A worthwhile read at the paperback price."
4,Rome is back,I LOVE this series! I must be honest and say that book 3 wasn't as good as book 2. But that is like saying that I won $10 million dollars instead of $20 million. It's still a great read and now I have to wait another year to read book 4. Again... if you want accurate history... READ A TEXT BOOK!! If you want a good story about Rome and her leaders... THIS is the series for you.Frosty
2,Glaring historical inaccuracies,"Although this book and the others in the series are supposedly historical novels, an author cannot play fast and loose with history. The author makes Caesar's mother mentally unstable as well as epileptic. He makes Brutus an orphan on the estate--except for the mother who abandoned him because she's a prostitute. Caesar gets to kill Mithradites--although Pompey really did. He has Marius killed by Pompey in a barricaded Rome! How could you believe any insight that Iggulden has into Caesar's character when he recreates historical fact?"
4,I found a new author...,For me! Liked the book so much I ordered an extra copy for my Mom.Easy reading. Full of descriptions of Caribbean customs . Like his style.
2,Questionable Sources,"While I very much want to give this book a good review (it's subject is so important), at least one of the ""stories"" in Ms. Nelson's book is grossly exaggerated and at least partially, fabricated. I am married to DeAnne Deane's former ""boyfriend"" in this book, and has a quite different account of what actually occurred after her partners suicide. Talk about rewriting history! It was his money that bailed her out and tried to clean up this mess for the next 7 years before he literally ran for his own emotional life (instead of kill himself like Wayne did). Her partner who shot himself (and was supposedly the victimizer) can't speak for himself to rebut DeAnne's allegations. Ms. Nelson needs to do a little better job of screening her interview subjects. In my opinion, Ms. Nelson's credibility has been seriously compromised."
2,M.C. Escher,I am an art teacher and was looking for a good video on Escher. This was not it. I could hardly stay awake watching it; so I definately didn't show it to the students. There were a few pieces of interesting information but there were more photographs and animations of Escher's work with background elevator music. I was looking for an informative video on Escher's life; this was not it.
1,BORING!!!!!,"I showed this to my math class to teach them about tessellation and it was the most boring thing I've ever seen. It reminded me of a cheezy 1970's episode ""in search of"". I felt so bad about showing this that I stopped it after about 15 minutes. Don't waste your time."
1,"Escher is fascinating, but this DVD is not...","Although this 50-minute documentary does explain a few tidbits about Escher's tesselations and impossible structures, it's very hard to watch. The camera is in constant motion, panning relentlessly across drawings, or spinning them at a speed that makes the viewer queasy. In between are long sequences with Escher experts drawing on chalkboards. Our family became frustrated as the camera would often linger on a tiny section of a drawing, but never reveal the total work. I think that a book with good reproductions of Escher's work would be a much better choice for experiencing his art."

5,How to Create a High-Profit Photo Business in any Market,"Excellent update (2011). Focus on high school seniors, little league sports, and weddings. Provides precise examples to prepare for photo shoot, employees/assistants, marketing and selling strategies, and networking. Easy, detailed read for new professional photographers, starting/improving their own business. Good Luck with your endeavor!"
1,This book is not worth the paper it's printed on.,"I bought this book because of other readers' reviews. I was deluded. I want to start a photography business, and except for some very flimsy public relations information and a few general suggestions about business practices, it gave me nothing. Nada. As soon as it came today, I plowed into it looking for help. I don't need a lesson on lighting, thank you very much. I don't need to know that the author has a high end studio that I can't afford yet. I don't need to know that telephone manners are important. Not yet. I want to know how to get launched, how to set up accounts, what I need for permission forms, what copyright issues I'm facing, and there's only a meager dry crust of bread in this book."
3,Good book but low level,"I am a Firmware Engineer currently but have a degree in Electrical Engineering so I felt this book would help me relate my Electrical experience to the Firmware world. I was disappointed when I realized how basic this book was. They dedicate a full chapter to basic voltage, resister, capacitor, etc concepts. Even with no on the job experience outside of school I found almost nothing that I did not already know. It is good for people who need to learn the basics but if you have any computer architecture experience or electrical engineering experience then this book is not for you."
5,Where has this book been all my career?,"Though an EE by training, I've spent over a decade developing software. Of course, writing embedded software does keep me close to the hardware. So I know how to read a schematic and use an oscilloscope to probe the hardware. But I've never actually designed a board of my own. This book gives me the confidence to do so. It belongs on every embedded designer's bookshelf and should soon become a classic."
4,Very helpfull,"Although it is used, it is in great condition and from basics to the final concept all is there. Many things are known to somebody with an engineering degree, but it's a very good refreshing for certain points you did not use for several years."
4,Great!,"Adam Sandler does it again, with another fun movie! This one is action-packed, and a great buddy movie. Damon Wayans is excellent in this film as well, and the two together make for a fun memorable show.The ending will leave you with a few loose ends, but you won't miss much... with an ending as funny as the rest of this film."
4,This movies is really good,Bullet Proof is a great combination of comedy and action. Wayans and Sandler are perfect for their characters; melding each of their comedic styles without loosing personal flavor. One of the best comedy/action movies I have seen. My only complaint is the film's occasional predictability.
4,Good product.,I rated this product this way because I got a clean DVD with no scratches or blemishes on the surface.
1,S-U-C-K-E-D,"This movie is a terrible movie, worst Adam Sandler movie ---ever--- first of all Sandler isnt meant to play serious roles like that because he usually plays funny guys like in Water boy Mr. Deeds, Big Daddy and all the other ones. Sure its PAcked with Explosions and Gun Fights but Sandler just doesnt fit there you know. BUT RELLY THE MOVIE ISNT THAT BAD......the cassette could be used as a leg in a broken stool or something?"
2,"I'm Adam Sandler's fan, but not this time!","Don't waste your money on this one. The number of reviews for this movie indicates that this wasn't his best... Damon Wayans knows what comedy is all about, but not here. Adam didn't provide the laughs this time... Watch once and never look back! Poorly presented on DVD (Universal Pictures)...You can find other reviews by me to other releases by Adam Sandler."
2,ADAM SANDLER'S WORST MOVIE,THIS MOVIE HAD SOME FUNNY PARTS BUT OTHER JOKES WERE JUST TOO STUPID.SO DONT WATCH THIS MOVIE
2,This is not a kids movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1,I don't know how this ended up in the family kids section. This is definately not a kids movie.
1,Bullutproof (HD DVD),"It don't work in my Blu-ray player, or computer..The person who sold me this blu-ray had to know it didn't work.."
4,"Though not a masterpiece, a movie worth watching!","Bulletproof brings to the screen the story of two buddies who've made a habit of breaking the law. Things become rather complicated when the two have a fallout as a result of one turning out to be an undercover cop and the other shooting him in the head. Luck has it though, that the two are far from seeing the last of each other...Though not a masterpiece, it is a funny film, guaranteed to provide more than a just a few laughs.Adam Sandler, Damon Wayans, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least! All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows!The setting, the dialogues, the humor, and the music are all wonderful!Overall, Bulletproof is a movie definitely worth watching, and even though you might want to stop short of adding it to your collection, it will surely put you in a good mood!"
3,A buddy movie with lots of action,"Adam Sandler appears in an buddy / action movie with Damon Wayans work together as comedians, but not exactly as action stars. This movie is full of action, explosions, gun fights, fighting in general and a more serious Sandler. Damon plays an undercover cop that befriends and later captures the crook Sandler in a big chop shop sting. That is only the start of the movie as then the leader of the chop shop played by James Kahn wants Sander dead for bringing a cop into his crime ring. So during a prisoner transport from a city jail to a prison via plane Kahn's goons intercept Sandler and Damon before the plane fully takes off the ground. The plane then crash lands in a backwoods area where then cop and criminal must avoid thugs while they go back into the city to the police station. Great buddy movie, but neither of them is an action hero."
4,"Mom, are you high again?","Adam Sandler and Damon Wayans have great chemistry on screen.Wayans plays a cop who goes undercover and befriends Sandler in order to bust a HUGE drug smuggling ring, with ties to the FBI. The bust sours, Wayans takes a bullet in the head and Sandler escapes.Later Wayans is assigned to bring Sandler in to finish what he started. A large group of cops gather to bring Sandler in and, once again, something goes wrong. Wayans is left on his own with Sandler. Sandler accuses Wayans of being cold-hearted because he was only pretending to be his friend, and Wayans rags on Sandler for shooting him in the head.I do not want to give away the whole movie, but it is action-packed and Wayans and Sandler trade hilarious one-liners."
3,worth a look,"This movie could have been better, but it works pretty well as an action comedy. It stars Damon Waynes and Adam Sandler, ..so you know they'll be some laughs. Their chemistry however is the best thing about the movie. I won't bore you with a summary, there are other reviews here that do a pretty good job with that."
1,Just a couple problems...,"There were only two things I didn't like about this movie:1. The writing.2. The acting.Other than that, it was kinda ok.(BTW, Amazon mistakenly categorized this film as a ""comedy"". It's not funny)."
3,Still not to his potential,"Typically, I am not a fan of Adam Sandler movies. To me, his humor tends to be toilet humor more appealing to a younger generation. However, in this movie Sandler does a good job of playing the bad boy who wants to be good. Sexual innuendo, another Sandler staple, underlies much of the humor but there are a few bright moments of something that rises a little out of the gutter. It is not a classic comedy but I was suspecting something worse. It is not acceptable for kids but not as much in the gutter as other Sandler films. Still, it seems that Sandler has much greater potential than this and we are again disappointed that he chooses the easy low road to gutter humor rather than living up to that potential."
4,Wayans and Sandler - great comedy duo,"I thought this was a great example of this type of movie - cop/bad guy partnership/friendship. Both Damon Wayans and Adam Sandler were at the top of their form. It had a few differences in plot, too, so it wasn't the same old, same old. I liked that Sandler was lower key in this movie - just as funny.I especially loved the whole sequence at the motel and the motel owner. Hilarious. And, as always, James Caan plays a terrific bad guy. I don't know why I haven't heard more about this movie.Lots of action, plane crash, bullet to head, car chases. What's not to like?"
5,It was awesome,"I watch this movie over and over. It is funny, it has action, and suspense all in one. Some of the lines in this movie are so funny, that if the movie had made it in the box office it would of had popular one liners from this movie. It is about cops and robers working together to solve crimes kind of like 48 hours, with a twist. Very good movie."
5,Knowing Your Power,"This book is amazing. The title says it all & really speaks to me about the human in all it's glory & power. I remember when I first heard the title, I felt the excitement come over me. It really does highlight the power of free will & choice. Story uses wonderful examples to show how the individual is choosing, what they are choosing and how they manifest this in their lives.Once again, Story, thank you. I went back & reread the Messiah Seed and felt the pure joy & love in the words. Both books, combined with the audio ""Love Is Awake"" are must haves for anyone seeking their own empowerment & growth!"
5,Beyond Words,"I bought the MP3 version to this book because i wanted to hear it coming from Story Waters himself.... and let me tell you, this is one of the most powerful, self empowering, loving book you can get your hands on. Everytime i listen to it, i come to an even newer self realization, and what I AM to this chosen life. The love that has poured through my heart after hearing these words are unimaginable.Get this book!"
1,lost time,This watch would get hung up and would lose time everyday. Dropped it once and it broke. Coolest looking watch I've had but wasn't practical.
2,"Let the editor, edit","This book was good when it stuck to the story of climbing the mountain. Roper goes off the story so often it is distracting. If he would have stayed away from philosophy, current events, past events, psychology, etc.... he could have shortened his book by at least one hundred pages. Stay with the story!! It may be a shorter read but a better read."
3,I could have done without the philosophy,"Yes, we are all human, and have egos. Mr Roper did more to erode the human Mr Unsoeld with his speculation, grandiose words and tangential philosophy, than to give us insight into the great man himself. I recommend this book to only those who want more 'fluff' and less 'stuff'."
5,Great Album :]],"The Matches have always amazed me, and their new album, ""Decomposer"", is no exception. There's something for everyone whether you listen to pop, punk, techno, it doesn't matter! The lyrics are exciting and strange, the beats are pumping, and music is unique and fun. The Matches have broken out of the standards for rock and created something innovative, something that no one has ever done before. They truly are like no other. Buy this album for your mom, your little sister, your neighbor, your dog. Everyone is bound to find something within it that they'll love."
1,the matches have decomposed....,"...into something that is not even recognizable anymore. Debut CD was great, catchy, and fun, but this is just crap. I really hope they get back to what they were good at for thier 3rd try."
5,Unbelievable,"I just want to start by saying tha decomposer is simply amazing. Before I heard it, I had a feeling that it was going to be different from E Von Dahl. I was right. It seems that every song I listen to, I find myself saying, I really like this song. It is hard to put in words how good the album actually is. The Matches simply are amazing and obviously can write some pretty sweet stuff.As far as overproduced, you need to realize that E Von Dahl was produced by The Matches. I am pretty sure they could have a 100 people help produce this album. I think with the help they got and who it was, says this is going to go big and they abviously want it to go big. I think that the album is amazing and genius. The Matches flippin rock and always will."
5,A Top-Notch Story with a Great Theme,"Ms. Gutteridge has managed to combine a stirring plot with a great theme. The story drives you along, and the characters are real (and people you can care about). The story is unique, the plot twists are many, and the whole experience will leave you feeling glad that you spent the time. The book will also deepen your thinking about people - and life."
2,Not Worth It,"This CD contains 3 versions of My Immortal (the orignal, the band version that is currently being played on MTV, and a live version from Cologne). In addition to that they also include a live taping of Haunted.The differences between the original and the band versions of this song are very minute. Basically, in the band version the guitars and drums kick in right before the last chorus and only stick around for approximately 30 seconds. And considering that this is such a soft song, the live version isn't much different from the original either. However, the live version of Huanted was pretty good. But I wouldn't say that it makes this CD worth it's price.If you already own Fallen, then this might not be the Evanescence CD-single for you. You might want to check out their Going Under Import CD-single. That one has a great Nirvana cover of Heart Shaped Box and is, in my opinion, worth the price."
5,Immortal,"This song took me completely by surprise. It saved Evanescence from one-dimentionality. This song is the most unabashedly poetic and heartfelt piece of music played on the radio in years. The magnificent orchestra arrangement heard on the album version, Amy Lee's hauntingly beautiful and mourning vocals (which are basically an F-U to everyone who says she can't sing), and the subtle, yet piercing, emotion in the song all prove how good Evanescence really is. Any doubts I had about them were obliterated upon hearing this song. By far the best song of 2004. If you don't have the album, buy this. It has the ""Band Version"" which is basically the radio edit, and the beautiful album version, which is even more gently haunting. In a year of countless, horrible songs played constantly on the radio, Evanescence released a song that was actually that, a ""song"". And a damn awesome one at that. Go Evanescence!!"
5,"Way to go, Amy Lee!","""My Immortal"" is such a beautiful song! In my opinion, it should have been used as the end titles song for ""The Return of the King."" Go Evanescence!"
1,My Immortal (or) Unrequited Love,"The Canadian got the review right (23_FEB_04).In case you didn't get it, My Immortal is a songabout unrequited love--I'm sure."
1,Abysmal.,"""My Immortal"" makes a pretty good case for the Worst Song in the history of music. It's not merely a song that's not good. It's horrific. It not only fails to add to, but also takes away from one's listening experience. The singing is extremely annoying, and the piano part is not bad, just simple- Mozart could write it in his sleep. All these things considered, I could still write this song off as another stupid, annoying ditty by another one of today's unoriginal, untalented artists. But then they add in electric guitar and drums, for about thirty seconds, probably to make their moron fans think, ""Oh wow! What brilliance! Listen to how beautifully they've mixed musical styles! lol!""The electric guitar and drums do nothing to redeem this song. It is truly one of the worst I've ever heard."
1,MAKE IT STOP!,"The first time I heard ""My Immortal"", I was just like ""eh this is alright I guess"". Never did I think it would end up turning into this huge massive hit on mainstream radio thats played every 20 minutes. Why did I not think so? Well for starters- ITS NOT THAT GREAT OF A SONG. Its just a generic love song that sounds like the worst of Sarah McClacan in the first 3/4 of it and the best of Linkin Park (which still isnt that great) in the last 1/4 of it. Amy Lee's voice is very thin and has no real identity to it. It doesn't comfort or move you at all. Try something different."
1,how awful,"This is just awful. Very dark and boring songs, and her voice is more then bad. I hate her so much, please stop this awful music if you can call it that."
1,Good simplicity is NOT trite.,"Emotion out of simplistic songs is usually ruined by blunt lyricism, and this being no exception -- horrible song."
4,A pleasure doing business with you,This book my boyfriend had as a small child and lost it somewhere/somehow. I was super excited to get it for him and he really likes it.
4,a little too big,"I like that the watch is simple and I very much need to be able to see the time in the dark. BUT the band is a bit looser than I would like. It fits okay and won't fall off. But if there was a way to make it a bit smaller, I would. I bought this at target (which was surprisingly cheaper)."
2,Not recorded together,This CD is not recorded in the studio together. Rather Bizzy Bone and Layzie Bone acapellas are taken off of other CD's and put over new beats. This per say is a remixed album of Thug Brothers Vs Midwest Cowboy. As other reviewers say the beats are no where near the quality of the originals. Not to mention the verses have no theme on tracks as it can be noted that there is no chemistry flow and have awkward feelings. For a bone duo check out thug brothers instead of this disc. Thug Brothers is a hip hop collaboration of Bones' Layzie and the Outlawz' Young Noble.
1,a sad disgrace,just like the other two who have reviewed this cd i am disgusted by what real talk ent. did i love the label but do even layzie and bizzy know that they put an album out of thug brothers and midwest cowboy mix'd up its just sad i did like the beats tho and thats about it i want my money back for that one well because i have to give it a rating to go through i put it at a one but it doesnt deserve it
3,Slight fall off.,"""Subject..Aldo Nova"" (1983) #56.2nd album by Canadian Aldo Nova, was just a bit weaker than his debut the year before. ""Subject"", gave us the hit ""Monkey On Your Back"" #83 hot 100 and #12 MSR, a great song about the life of addiction. Other good tunes were, the power ballad ""Victim Of A Broken Heart"", ""Hold Back The Night"" and ""Always Be Mine"". His next album came out in 1985."
4,Very crunchy and tasty but not organic,"My family loves the taste of these. They're a bit high in sodium for my liking and for the price, I wish they were organic. I have purchased the Heart to Heart brand, but they taste much staler and have a strange aftertaste compared to these crackers. Too bad, because Heart to Heart has half the sodium."
3,"Good for practice, not formatted like exam","Like the first reviewer, I would say that this should not be your only practice exam. My big issue is that it is not formatted like the test. This book has one scenario per 5-6 problems, the problems build on one another. Miss the first and you are likely to miss them all. The real exam will have one scenario per problem. One of the challenges to the PE exam is having enough time to read all of the scenarios and come up of the solutions.I would recommend getting this along with the practice exam from Michael Lindeburg and from NCEES. Time yourself when you go through the NCEES. The Lindeburg series should be a must."
1,terrible,My poster came folded in half and in half again with four prominent crease marks. Of what value is the poster once it has been folded? I was refunded my money but would hesitate to purchase another item.
3,A Goofy Movie That is Cute!,"I watched this goofy comedy Cabin Boy and I agree that this isn't the best movie ever made but it was a cute movie with some amusing scenes and I think this is a good movie for anyone who likes their comedies to be very silly and I think Chris Elliot was good and so was Andy Richter as the dopey deck swab! This movie is dumb but it's susposed to be dumb and they never pretended it was anything but dumb humour! I would only recommend this movie to people who like movies like Dumb and Dumber, The Bio-Dome, etc, and obviously this movie isn't recommend to art fart snobs!"
1,Deserves to be in the worst movie category,"I am amazed that anyone would give this movie more than 2 stars. It was not funny. Cabin Boy was boring. Was there even a script? Seriously, don't torture yourself with this mind numbingly stupid movie. I would give it zero stars if possible."
4,More fun than the clap!,"""We're just here to catch fish and stink,"" says one fisherman. ""Mostly the latter,"" adds another.This is quite simply one of the most sublimely stupid films ever made."
3,kinda lame,the main guy goes to a proper school i think that is what it is called. later in the movie they see this giant(20 feet at least) married to this woman normal size. when the giant seen one of the guys with his wife of some thing like that he chases them. The way that they kill the giant is bi his own tie. when the normal sized people ere about not even leg tall.
4,Classic Chris Elliot,"I would imagine that some how Chris Elliot's style of humor isn't for everyone, but this movie is a classic. Just straight to the point stupid humor and jokes. Great movie."
3,Cabin Boy(1994)***,"Yes this is a very goofy movie, but yah gutta love it. Chris Elliot plays a ""fancy lad""(watever the hell that is) who is trying to get to his father on the boat: The Queen Catherine. But what he doesnt realize is that he got on the wrong boat. He actually got on the boat of these dirty fishermen by accident.They all hate him , and they basically make him there ""bitch"".In the end when he finally gets to where he is going, he and the crew are finally cool with each other(because he saved them from a giant...yup.)Anyways , see this movie there are some pretty funny scenes.Things to watch for:1David Leterman selling stuffed monkeys2Giant talking cupcakes that spit tobacco3Giant man4Man/Shark5Lady with multiple arms6Giant Snow monstersnow that i think of it, this movie is kinda weird...."
2,The trick to enjoying this movie is to..,"watch it with kids under the age of 13. But even the kids will tell you it's the worst movie they've ever seen.You know, I like Chris Elliot too and I thought ""Get a Life"" was pure comic genius before the network started tinkering with the recipe. But this thing (insert head shake thingy) is so monumentally bad I'm actually at a loss for words. The blue chick with 6 arms and her giant husband that just opened a ""housewares"" store on a remote deserted island was pretty creative. OK, seeing Chris Elliot riding on the back of his girlfriend swimming across the Pacific with a ski rope to hold on to was pretty funny but that was about it.Now, if you find yourself all that curious about this flick the DVD transfer is pretty good and the sound is about what you would expect...but who cares? 2 wigs"
1,Worst movie I've ever seen...no contest,"Cannot believe people actually liked this! Bad filming, ridiculous unconvincing dialogue and acting, and an even worse plot. It's completely random: a talking cupcake in the sky? A claymation ice-monster? I can see how it could be entertaining for the 4-7 audience, but no self-respecting 12-year old could seriously enjoy it. If inanity=brilliance, then here's your movie."
1,Dumbest filM I've EVER SEEEN,"this movie brings me back into the memories of 8th grade camp. We had two movie nights during the week and thinking the teachers can't, and shouldn't, choose a dumb movie, we expected something nice on the 2nd movie night. Guess what was waiting for us? Cabin Boy. It was the dumbest movie I've ever seen. Lame plot, if there was any, about some spoiled rich kid (""Fancy Lad"") named Nathaniel who's a total idiot trying to go back home with his ""adventures"" on the way. I, a person with no knowledge whatsoever in movie making, could just guess right away that the ""sea"" was pure swimming pool and that the ""ship"" was going nowhere. All the props were ""visible"" and worst of all, it was plain STUPID. Such a sad, horrible movie. An insult to the viewers."
4,Ma Ma Ma Moompa!,"There is one thing missing from this movie, and that is that it isn't available on DVD! People would have taken this movie more seriously if Letterman would not have knocked it so much right after it came out. It really is funny, if you don't expect it to contend for an Oscar. Just take it for what it's worth: an unrealistic, silly comedy, and you will enjoy it too."
4,didn't know this great re-issue,Tarentule is one of the great Breton trad albums. The original vinyl is extremely rare and expensive. It was originally released by a famous Brittany-based label ARFOLK. Tarentule somewhat sounds like French trad such as Malicorne. Even progressive rock fans would like it. The sleeve art is also nice.
5,Life into Art,"DREAMS OF MY RUSSIAN SUMMERS is a memoir, but it is also a reflection on the art of writing: ""I dreamed of a book that could remake the world with its beauty (229),"" of a portrayal so true that ""her presence in these drowsy streets had the reality, discreet and spontaneous, of life itself."" (241) Makine quotes an unnamed author: ""How to lie in the image of this beauty? That is what I should like to learn...that is the only knowledge, the first morality. This harmony is not illusory. It is real, and faced with it, I feel the necessity of the word."" (230) Proust is one of his influences, who said, ""The duty and the task of a writer are those of an interpreter."" It poses the question, what is more real - the event or the telling of the event? The excellent translation by Geoffrey Strachan sounds as if English were the original."
3,A very good ending,"The ending was the best part of this over-blown, excessively indulgent book. Interesting tidbits but the narrator is rather selfish & too introspective to hold much interest. If you loved it, it was because of Charlotte, NOT HIM"
2,Disappointing,"After reading such glowing reviews, I was very disappointed when finishing this novel. Overwritten, implausible and far too beholden to Proust (a model the author freely acknowledges) I found it's only achievement was Makine's attempt to describe being an outsider in two worlds and a member of none. He strives far too hard for literary effect and the effort shows (why use one appropriate adjective when ten will do?). It seems clear to me the critics who reviewed this book were starved for any gesture toward writing serious literature and this resulted in overpraising a modest effort (for another example, see ""Cold Mountain""). The novel was hated almost unanimously by my reading group."
2,Ultimately a disappointment.,"Haunting and beautiful in fits and starts, ""Dreams"" is ultimately a disappointment. Makine's keen insights, refined sensibilities, and sense of time and place are largely wasted on a narrator who remains a callow, self-absorbed youth as he advances chronologically into young manhood and early middle age. His relationship with Charlotte, which constitutes the focus of the book, is particularly vacuous: Charlotte is the only one who talks, and the narrator, as far as we can tell, the only one who thinks. Makine seems self-indulgent; he's presenting raw material that should have been shaped into a final product."
3,Something lost in the translation...,"In typical contemporary French fashion, there is an elliptical quality to this fictionalized memoir which suits the content. Nonetheless, Makine's fundamentally emotional story loses something in the translation I fear. The workmanlike rendition by Strachan eliminates the emotional richness of the French language and the Russian cultural impulse toward storytelling. What we receive in English is far more cool and clinical than I suspect it should be."
4,Hard to get into but worth it,"Because this novel is impressionistic, abstract, and dreamy at first it seems odd and plotless. However, if you're like me, this novel will pull you in and begin to work its magic on you. At first you may be put off by the excessive romanticism exhibited here--the focus on dreams as more significant than reality, the idealization of character, the emphasis on nostalgia and memory, the overwrought sensuality--but eventually you realize that the emotion is sincere and not sentimental. You begin to realize that the sketchy fragments do add up to a complete picture. If you are a lover of literature you begin to see the process that such a love is instilled in a child and how it can become the most essential focus of the mature individual's life. I did not rate the novel with 5 stars because it is flawed in parts, but it is well worth reading."
3,A young man's loss of innocence.,"I found it hard reading because it lacked continuity. His descriptions of places are good and and he does a good job of exploring relationships, especially his with his grandmother. Didn't care for accounts of his sexual awakening. I thought his fantasizing about Paris was hard to understand, but a lot of the book was fantasy. Would not recommend it but it was chosen by my book club."
1,Cheap Imitations,"I bought this CD shortly after the 9-11-01 tragedy and promptly returned it. Why? This album contains cheap arrangements of famous marches in which too many liberties are taken. Many of the marches begin with the second stanza instead of the beginning the way the composers had written them. Your ear immediately knows that something is wrong. I also found the arrangements to poke fun at the marches, which is annoying rather than patriotic. To make matters worse, the orchestral playing is third rate. The sound stinks too. These simply are not the genuine article. With so may great march albums available, pass this one up. Instead, try any of the Marine Band recordings that are available."
3,Where is the truth?,"I bought this book because it was supposed to be the best biography on OP Rockwell. The author clearly spent a lot of time researching and wanted to put it all in his book. On the plus side you get a lot of information; the downside is he does not do a very good job discriminating between what is truth and what is heresay and what is false. All sources were used, whether reputable or not. I sure wish Porter's alleged autobiography is found someday--now that would make for some good reading!"
2,You should read Rockwell's autobiography!,"O.P. Rockwell wrote his autobiography after the death of Brigham Young and although it is very hard to find a copy I got to read it at the R.L.D.S. archieves in Independence, Mo. According to Rockwell he had it published himself to try to set the record straight. Funny though, he makes himself out to be a cold-blooded killer who worked exclusively for B.Y. after the death of Joseph Smith Jr. There apparently were no ghost writers available to Rockwell as is evident by the word usage and the very straight foreword though disjointed way he tells his story. Quirky things are included like his saying that he never tried to assassinate Mo. Governor Boggs since the attempt failed and that Joseph Smith Jr. told him that he could not be killed if he never cut his hair, in an emulation of Samson."
4,How to know everything about Porter Rockwell,"Good book for learning about Porter Rockwell. Dispels the myth of the Danites. This book provided the basis for a research paper. Well researched and complete footnotes made for easy checking on sources. Later in the book however, the author gives too much credence to some anti-mormon assertions. He includes them, he says, to be complete, but then discounts them. After you finish this book you will know everything about the man."
1,Not worth it...stick with metal!!,"I had heard alot of rave reviews for silicone muffin pans & thought this was a great idea. BOY was I in for a rude awakening!! The instructions say to spray with non-stick spray so that the cupcakes will pop out easier. It implies that they come right out anyway, but you can help it along with the spray. I sprayed it quite liberally & the muffins would NOT come out!! I considered the whole batch a complete loss: They would not come out at all!! Stick with metal, unless you want to totally baby-sit your cupcakes & use a 1/2 of Pam per batch!!"
5,Excellent Cd,"I think this maybe one, if not, the best Teena Marie cd. There's no major big single she had off this album, but the album is totally solid from beginning to end. Best cut on the cd is Shadow Boxing, by far my favorite, very beautiful. Along with Cassanova Brown, Playboy, Stop the World, and Robbery. All the songs are great. Worth the price definetely!Robbery 4 starsPlayboy 4.5 starsShadow Boxing 5 starsMidnight Magnet 4 starsFix It 4.25 starsAsk Your Momma 3.75 starsDear Lover 4.5 starsStop the World 4.25 starsCassonova Brown 5 stars"
4,Talented TEENA! Great CD!,"This is Teena's 1st & best 'post-Motown' performance.She is a rare multi-talented musician, and she displays her many skills here. As usual, Teena wrote, produced, and performed most of the music by herself. Motown was crazy to let her go!! She is a master of Pop, R&B;,and Jazz, which are all performed so well. 'Lovergirl', 'Midnight Magnet', 'Stop The World', 'Ask Yo Momma', 'Shadow Boxing', and the classic 'Cassanova Brown' (inspired by Rick James!!) are all on Teena's 'Robbery'. The recent edition of 'Robbery' includes a few rare extended remixes, and I'd also recommend the new remaster (only if it doesn't have that dreaded copy protection embeded in the disc, which can harm your PC!!).Peace, SD(of 'Chaka's World')"
5,Marty Robbins - Lifetime of Songs,A great CD from the great Marty Robbins. Definitely a good one to own. Lots of his top hits. You'll love this one in your collection and one of the few that has El Paso City.
4,Great place to start and then some,"I've had this CD for quite a while and moved on to the individual albums so thought it would be interesting to look at it again now that I've gotten further into Marty's fabulous array of records. This collection still holds up really well and is totally worth every dime. There are defintely holes in it but the good news is it's a case of getting a lot of satisfaction finding out what else he did. I can't think of a ""country"" singer with a more soulful voice let alone his other talents. Marty was the man. After getting this collection I'd go right into ""Gunfighter Ballads and Trail Songs"" to start to delve further."
5,The only Marty Robbins Album you need in your collection!,"This album is great!!! It has every great song on it he did. He's a classic. It spans his hits from 1951 to 1982. El Paso, El Paso City, Big Iron, It's great."
5,Wonderful tool for Play Therapists,"This book is an easy to use guide for play therapists. It tells what age groups the acitivity is targeted for and the type of activity (assessment, feelings, anger, social skills, and self esteem). This book has been a great resource to interact with kids and get them to have fun while learning at the same time."
5,Easy interventions,Awesome book! I've used several of the interventions and they're user friendly and kid responsive.
2,Sensible insensibilities,"Nah ... !! WAY,way overrated.Different - because it's quite ancient & thus intriguing - but simply an ordinary sort of ' who dun it '.I won't say it's no good, but will say it's one of those films I know I won't bother to watch twice !"
3,Audio-Compression Error?,"The Criterion DVD is out of print, but I recently viewed a copy from Netflix. It seems that the technicians made a mistake with the audio compression on this disc. The audio is too compressed. Speech has a harsh, metallic sound, and background sounds are reduced to a constant hum. A setting must have been wrong in the software. The film deserves five stars, but this edition is a disappointment."
5,Happy time,"I've never been moved to write a review before, but this.... this is the thing. Not a duff track, not a duff note. The piano playing alone will make you choke it's so beautiful. And the band, and Cleary's voice, and the production, oh just buy it for heaven's sake"
5,"Cleary's Moonburn is brilliant, unique and Clearly inspiring","If you are into New Orleans Rhythm and Blues with a so sweet funky beat (done just right), then you need this CD. Cleary and the Gentlemen are excellent proformers; catch them live if you can. Their rhythmic sophistication and originality will blow you away."
5,One of the best releases this year,"Received this sight unseen in the mail (I'm a blues/soul DJ) and was amazed when I played it. A beautiful, funky record that sounds like Little Feat meets the Neville Brothers, except the sound is more original than that implies. Cleary is a strong vocalist and as good a songwriter--this is five star New Orleans funk record with some surprisingly tasty pop-sounding tunes as well. My favorite release of the year."
5,Quintessential New Orleans for the new Millenium,"I have never seen Jon Cleary play live, I bought this on reputation from fellow musicians. I am totally in love with this album -- it's been the only CD in my car for a month now. If you loved the sound and total groove of Robert Palmer's ""Sneakin' Sally Through the Alley"" album (which had New Orleans and Little Feat back-up), you can't not love this album. Unlike one of the reviews, I love the production on this album -- Cleary is a master, not only piano player and groove maker, but lyrics and themes. For grownup tastes. I'll bet the Steely Dan duo cop stuff from this one!"
5,Lacy J. Dalton,"I saw Lacy on Bill Anderson's Country Reunion and reminded me that I hadn't thought about her for years. I had always loved her singing 16th Avenue. She talked about how she came to record it and then sang it. I have always loved her distinctive voice but have never had one of her CDs. I saw that the song 16th Avenue was on this album and bought it because of that. But all the songs on this CD are great. I loved the album so much, I ordered another one of her albums that I haven't received yet. I highly recommend this album."
3,Still Nothing Like The Original,"Bought this for our 3 year old daughter for Christmas. It arrived in just the Big Wheels box,no outer packaging. Had holes and tears in the box. Amazingly all pieces were there. Not like the original Big Wheels, it is very light weight. Stickers are really crappy. Our daughter has not used it much yet, so hard to say how it will hold up."
1,unhappy customer,this product is a piece of crap. i cannot believe this is the famous BIG WHEEL i used as a child. the pedels did not move freely as they need to. the back tire fell off after my 4 year old tryed to ride it with faulty pedels within 15 minutes.
4,Blast from the past!,I had a really hard time finding a big wheel at any store or online. So I was really excited to buy this for my son whose not really big into riding his bike as much. It just brings back memories for me. Not nearly as strong of plastic as I thought it would be. Nothing has broken. But I can't imagine it lasting a long time with a kid standing on it and pushing it forever.
2,still mad,"I posted a review on Christmas Eve about this toy and it seems to have been taken down and I am wondering why.The bigwheel was a huge disappoint to me. I bought it for my 3 yr old grandson for Christmas, on the 24 of December we open the beat-up box that looked like it had been to hell and back to discover that the bike had NO axel, and one of the rear tires had obviously been severly used. So Grandpa rushs to Ace hardware to try and find something to make a axel out of, so my grandson would have something under the tree from Santa...thank god they stayed open this Christmas Eve night, we got an axel, $3.95 .This was purchased as a NEW item. I trusted that fact and was disappointed to find that it was NOT a new item. So, with that said, I wouldn't buy from these people again."
3,Improvement needed,There is a need to improve a couple of things in order for me to give a good review. First the quality of the directions is poor. They need to make it easier to tell which way to face the rear wheels (I put them on backwards and needed to head to the hardware store to buy new push nuts). Also the pre-drilled holes for the screws did not line up so when I put on the brake it was so close to the wheel that it rubs and is hard for the rider to peddle. The low quality parts and poor directions make it a pain to assemble. If my boy loves it and it lasts for a year then my hard work and frustration will be worth it.
3,new manufacterer?,"I have not bought this yet. In searching for a ""Big Wheel"" I tried to find the manufacterer but couldn't on Amazon. The new manufacterer (made in America)[...], doesn't sell on Amazon, but in the big stores. I just want to see if Amazon will list the manufacerer of each so the new Original Big Wheel manufacterer doesn't get a bad reputation now that is is being made in America. if any have ordered, who is the manufacterer?"
2,very disappointed,I also was a owner of the original big wheel and bought two of these for my grandchildren. They are of poor quality--nothing like the original and they do not hold up for little rough boys. I had two sons and they did everything possible to the original and it just kept rolling---NOT so with this one
1,Disappointing Quality,"The is a classic toy. I remember mine as a kid, and recently bought one for my two year old daughter. While assembling it Christmas Eve, I was extremely disappointed with the quality of the parts that are included to put the bike together. Two flimsy ""cap nuts"" are supposed to be hammered onto the end of the rear axle to hold the tires on. These simply keep falling off, along with the wheels. Real fun. Also, the pedals are supposed to be hammered on and held in place with ""lock washers"". One of the washers snapped and so the pedal fall offs too. The manufacturer could easily throw a couple extra of these fragile parts in the box--especially when the design is so poor."
2,Durability stinks...but still fun,"We bought a similar big wheel (same manufacturer) for my 3 year old and he had an issue with the pedal length. We solved by just sliding the seat forward and drilling our own hole and have had no problems since.Our biggest complaint is the durability of the front wheel. The pedal axle has a rectangular block that engages the ""big wheel"" and that keeps popping out. This is very frustrating because I recall wearing holes in the plastic tires as a kid.We have had about 3 months of fairly good use which is not really what I expected. I would not suggest a this toy. We, as consumers, need to be less concerned with how inexpensive something is and more concerned with quality.The quality of this toy does not make the grade."
3,"Problems, problems...","My son got this for his 3rd birthday. He received it as a gift already assembled. The pedal fell off within 15 minutes. We tried using a hammer to pound it back on, but no matter what we did it wouldn't stay on. Called customer service and left a message on their machine. Just when we were thinking they were never going to return our call, a package arrived with 2 new pedals. We haven't even put the new pedals on yet, because at 39"" tall, my son still can't reach the pedals enough to really ride it. Instead of saying age 3 and up, I wish they would list a recommended height in the info section."
2,Missing Parts!?!?!?! 3 or 4 Weeks Due to Popularity????,"Just received my Original Big Wheel for my son and the axle that holds the back wheels on is not in the box. I call customer service and left a message on their recorder that the part was missing. Went to the website for faster service................ After you fill out the information, it tells you that you will have to wait 3 or 4 weeks due to high demand. Try telling this to your kid when he is watching feverishly as you open the box. Looks like the parts were just thrown into the box without proper packaging. Thumbs down until I can get the parts to repair."
2,Poor quality control,The hub of one of the rear wheels was defective and will not last very long. The peddles are very difficult to put on their shafts and then don't turn freely. This makes the Big Wheel very difficult to ride. The mfr is lacking in quality control.
1,Not what the seller is showing in the add,"After ordering the Big Wheel from amazon I read the reviews, I then decided to call All in Toy's and ask them about there product, Original Big Wheel 16 Inch Tricycle, after talking to them I was told the original company went out of bussiness about 2 years ago and another company bought the patent rights to this product. I asked if the product was the same, and was told the it was the one with the hand brake and spoked front wheel. it is not the same as the picture shown in Amazon, so I cancelled the order. Amazon needs to conferm a sellers product and conferm if it truly is an original product. Disapointed............."
5,Get It Much Cheaper Elsewhere,"Target and Sportmans Guide offer the Big Wheel for much less money.I bought 2 Big Wheels for my then 4 year old son and 2 year old daughter. They have had a blast riding them for the past couple of years. Big Wheels are by far their favorite thing to ride. Plus, they're low to the ground and pretty safe.The Big Wheel is not as durable as the one I had back in the day, but it is a decent toy to help get your kids away from video games and off the couch.I had no problem putting it together."
3,Big Wheel Purchase,"I am not convinced this product is made in the U.S.A. It has to be China. After all the reviews about the problems with the pedals, (which I also experienced) why doesn't the mfr. fix this product since it is a great toy? It took me about 3 hours to assemble it due to the cheap plastic parts."
3,"Oldie, but a goodie?","Cheaply made, but still a thriller. My little girl hasn't ridden it much, but pedals fall off immediately. Mine never did as a kid. But as they say, you can never go home. Still it's fun seeing it out in the yard or driveway."
1,Rip off alert!,"be warned! You will NOT receive the big wheel modeled in this image! The model you will receive will be a later, cheaper model. Of course they do not bother to tell you that until you call to complain. Another Amazon rip-off. You'd be better off on Craigs List... At least there you expect to get mugged........"
1,Missing Part,Ordered the Big Wheel for my son for Christmas. The box was missing the front metal axle. I have tried to get the part sent to me but no one responds to my email. So I currently have a Big Wheel that I can not put together.
3,stronger? I don't think so. Fun? yes..,"I would have expected this BIG WHEEL to have STEEL or IRON frame -- for as much as it cost.. but my grandson likes it, don't LOVE it, but likes it.. I think we both expected it to be a little bit bigger & sturder. He is 5 today.It should last a year.. hopefully."
4,Will's Bike,The child seems to enjoy it. Directions could have been a little simplier.To many items to put together. Decal's should have better glue.
1,shopper,"Not at all what I expected. Cheap looking. It said for ages over three and up to 8 years old. This is not true. My son has a fisher price one he loves and I brought this for him hoping it was for big kids it was the original big wheel 16 inch orange county chopper one. He is 4 1/2 and is way to small for it. It does not compare to the fisher price one. It also came without pedals but I think this was a Meijers thing. It is going back if I have the energy. I brought two at the same time, one for toys for tots.[...]"
3,Love the toy--hate Amazon's price,"I am really becoming disillusioned with Amazon. DO NOT PAY THIS PRICE. Target sells them for $39 and $29 on sale. (Just purchased today.) Easy to assemble and both 2-year old (tall as a four-year old) and 7 year-old ride the same bike. Shame on you Amazon for your outrageous mark-up! And yes, I am talking about the 16"" model, original Big Wheel company."
1,Not as good as it is suppose to be.,"My son got this for his birthday in April... Being that it is only July, you would think that it would still work. However, the stickers are all pealing, the pedals do not move and the bike is just over all too hard for my 4 year old to use. So sad since we was so excited to get it. :("
1,Big Wheel - Big Disappointment!,"We bought my 4yr. old son one of these and six weeks later the front tire has a huge whole and I'm predicting by the end of the month it will be unrideable. It is poorly made and for the price it was not worth it. I would like to recommend The Radio Flyer 2-in-1 bike. We purchased this when my son turned 2. It starts out as a tricyle and then you can flip it and lock it into place and it becomes a big wheel. The big wheel seat has three settings. We just threw it out two months ago because my it finally became unrideable. He used it every chance he could, 2 years worth and also shared it with our neighborhood children. I loved it and plan on getting one for my youngest when he turns 2."
1,jump tomorrow,"A badly shot, uninventive and plotless 'film' with a slew of dull characters played by overacting non-actors. I can only guess that the other reviews on this site were sent in by friends of the director or the director himself."
4,Don't do it!,"Quirky fun, with quirky characters falling in love and second guessing themselves and wondering why they fall in love and second guess themselves; frustrated they consider suicide, luckily a fun Frenchman figures out how to help. For a romantic comedy it's pretty OK."
1,"Actually, it's minus five stars","I sat through this horrible piece of garbage in the theater, sitting beside my four year old son who didn't know any better. There's no plot to speak of, no script worth remarking, but only Ernest and companions seemingly ad libbing (badly) their way through the landscape with a giant cannon.I was a fan of the earlier Ernest movies, liked the impossibly dopey humor, but this isn't just the bottom of the Ernest barrel, it's actually a deep pit beneath the barrel, close to the core of the earth, where terrible creatures lurk.If you must buy this awful thing, do not watch it with the children. They don't want to see what's inside your stomach."
5,"Oneida Exeter 65-Piece Flatware Set with Caddy, Service for 12","Beautiful, shiny flatwear. We love it"
5,not sure what set you got,"but mine arived and is very sturdy and the pieces are larger than most on the market also in the box is a lifetime warranty, I bought a second set so i would never be without the full set for a lifetime and never run out during a party. thanks for the great deal onieda sells them for over 100 bucks for the same product on their site."
2,"Ok, but not as expected.","I have a set of Oneida that I purchased over 30 years ago. It was the cheapest Oneida at the time. It was discontinued, so I was looking for something to supplement what I have. This is no comparison. The back is unfinished, it is much thinner and the polishing is missing in places. I will keep it for the price but it is not the same quality as what I have at all."
2,Place forks are HUGE! Doesn't match the place spoons...,"I bought two because it wasn't a bad deal at $39.99 each I will have to return them as the place forks are way too big...They are the length of the knives. it is the salad forks that match the size of place spoons. And then the teaspoons are iddy biddy besides all the others. The pictured setting is not accurate. Such as odd looking setting with the ""pitchforks"" standing out."
5,Fabulous Flatware,I was skeptical of the quality of this flatware based on the price but was amazingly surprised and wish I had the need to purchase another set. It's way better than I expected. The flatware is very heavy and brilliantly shiny.
2,Disappointing,"I ordered this set because I have had other Oneida flatware that was very good quality and this was a really good price. The first set I received had 11 forks and 13 knives. The knives were beautiful, but the design quality on most of the other pieces was not very good. I returned the set for replacement. The new set had the correct number of pieces, but the design quality on the handles still isn't very good on a lot of the pieces; some of them don't look like flowers and some are almost smooth with no design at all. I kept the second set because I figured it wasn't going to get any better sending back for another one, but I am really disappointed and probably won't buy Oneida again."
4,Happiness is a state of mind,"I'm not going to relate the story - only post my thoughts on the movie.I liked it. I think everyone can identify with the problems the main characters faced. Life is hard. Life is lost jobs, disappointment - a never ending stream of problems. I think even the richest of rich people among us experience it, but especially those that are struggling financially. For them, the emotional struggle and wounds that can be left from years and even decades of struggling can be an overwhelming psychological experience.The movie was quite popular and I sensed that everyone enjoyed it."
5,Holy Cow,Holy Cow. I'm an old guy with a lot of movies behind me. I didn't know that a movie could still get to me like this one did.
3,The pursuit of materyalysm...,"This was a well-made film, with fine acting, direction, and writing; the problem for me is that the film (unsurprisingly) has a seriously materialistic overtone to it, as if being ""rich"" will solve all of life's problems (especially as a stock broker, a job with one of the highest suicide rates of all modern professions). Here is the story of a hard-working man that ultimately got lucky; this is not the story of Joe Stockbroker, I assure you. Personally, I think that this man would be ""happyer"" with a stable job (i.e., not ""broking"") and a stable relationship with a woman with whom to raise his son. If they had shown that becoming ""rich"" financially is not the direct path to ""happyness,"" but only the potential foundation for a stable life, then perhaps my opinion would be different. Granted, the man was in a rough spot, but there are assuredly others in the world that are ""happy"" with far fewer finances than this man had at his low-point..."
4,WILL SMITH'S DYNAMICS,"Today I went to see the much awaited Pursuit of Happyness. With the big hype I expected to see a great movie. Needless to say I was not disappointed; but not blown away. What kept this movie alive was the warmth and enthusiasm of Will Smith. Never have I seen him so emotionally involved in his character. Thinking about each scene there wasn,t one that I can remember without him. He must have been exhausted.This movie did bring to light what it is like to be broke and homeless. It was not something that usually happens in such a persons life; to still have a vision. There is a real warmth between Will and his son, who gives a memorable portayal. Will Smith deserves recognition for his stunning performance."
5,Hard work and perserverance,This movie is very inspiring and pushes one to work hard in their own lives.
4,Smith didi it !,"Will Smith = action movie. I was avoiding to see the film because of this idea. I like Will Smith movies but seeing him in a drama lead role was something I was not preapred to. After reading some positive comments I decided to go to the theater and watch it.Will Smith changed my mind after seeing the movie. His performance is oustanding. He's really into his role, you can feel the anguish, the worries, the sadness in his face... but there's hope too. Hope to change his life, to give his son a better life than his own, hope to prove himself as a winner.Seeing the film is a powerfull experience. I leave the theater questioning my own goals and what will it be if I put some effort to reach them. Chris Gardner's history is an example of perseverance nad determination to change his life in a positive view.As I said before, Smith is superb in his role, especially in the subway bathroom scene and the gospel singing act. You did it Will."
3,GOOD BUT NOT GREAT!,"I enjoyed this movie,but not as much as I thought I would. They dwell too long in the down side.....so long that I was saying to myself ""come on already""! the payoff is quick and not a satisfying as is should have been. A good movie,not a great one."
3,I would not try to get a job at a company that exploits employees this way,"Why couldn't Chris borrow some money from his bosses who are so rich? The guy called Jay should pay for his taxi to begin with. If I performed so well at work, I would expect at least some compensation, and I wouldn't believe that will affect my chance of geting hired for full time!"
2,OK Story Movie though???,"Like this guy is the only one that has had hard times. It is all about him getting in the 'door' not about how he struggled. I, along with others, have worked hard and gotten no where, because we don't get invited to the game, we are smarter than our managers but since we don't go out drinking with them we get pushed aside doing clerical work.Therefore I am not impressed with this story any more than ""wow someone made it""."
1,a soppy lie,"a pathetic, artificial, overdone, phony piece of crap. seriously. the american dream. really? are we that naive? i couldn't even finish it, you'll know how it ends from the start. it should be called in pursuit of money."
1,Capitalist Propaganda,"There are only a few movies that I find so detestible that I can't finish watching. This was one of those. I hated the message that anyone has a chance to succeed in this society if he works hard enough. That message is an afront to everyone who doesn't make it, who is poor and remains poor. In the first place, nobody should have to go through what the hero of Pursuit went through. What are we doing? Creating a system in which one exceptional person ""makes it"" while the rest are just sludge to be plowed back under? The irony of this is that the real person this ""true story"" is based on had affirmative action going for him. But that wouldn't fit the message of this film that anyone who tries hard enough can succeed. A more honest treatment of this guy's true story would show the role of government intervention in giving people a foot-up."
2,Get on with it - slow,"This movie was soooo slow.. At great story, ruined by a move that was 30minutes too long."
1,Worse film I've seen in 10+ years -NO KIDDING.,Thank you to the 11 prior people that gave this 1 star! At least I know that there are a very small group of SANE people out there!!!I don't know how anyone could find this movie inspirational or a loving example of fatherhood. I can't believe Will Smith would get behind something as empty. What an absolute beating.
1,Worst movie I have ever seen!!,"Are they kidding? This is easily the worst movie I have ever seen. This fool violates the first rule of investing, by spending his life savings on those machines that he then has trouble selling. Then his dream to transform his life: to be a stock broker. Give me a break. How bourgeois. And once he was a success, no mention is made about what he did with that money to say...help the homeless since he was one for sometime.And all the Thomas Jefferson quotes, what does a slave-owning aristocrat really know about freedom?The American dream in this movie is one of the false values this society actively promotes. Don't fall for it!Save your money and watch something with some value, like I Love Huckabees."
2,I really wanted to like this film...,"Will Smith is one of my favorite actors, but the script is not up to the challenge. My expectation was to see an uplifting film about a man beating the odds. Mostly what I got was the undeniable awful side of society. I realize it is based on a real person's life, but half way through the film, I got the feeling the person did not know that there is a safety net call welfare, and that my uplifting movie turned out to be for the most part, a long squeamish downer.I bought the DVD - This one is not a keeper."
3,Great performances cannot rescue needlessly long film.,"The biggest problem with this film is the script;it needs to be trimmed severely.Two hours of plodding disappointment and ""bad luck"" for about two minutes of happiness does not make for the most effective viewing.Much of the hardship could have been compressed and the point would have still been made effectively.Will Smith's performance of(inspired by a true story) Chris Gardner is truly outstanding and the film is worth a see just for that alone;but overall the film has a drone about it that stays stuck in a downward spiral just like it's lead character.DOOR TO DOOR with William H.Macy is a better treatment of a similar subject."
1,Possibly the worst movie I've ever seen,"There are two ways to look at this movie. Either it is a rags to riches story or a story about what is wrong with Amerika. I choose the later. It shouldn't be this hard to succeed in Amerika, supposedly the richest country in the world."
5,OMG GREAT GREAT MOVIE!!!,This movie was my very favorite. How a man struggles to make it in this world and how he did it with his son. Anything is possible if you really strive to make it come true.
4,Will Smith Makes It,"""The Pursuit of Happyness"" is not an exceptional film because of special effects or script. It is exceptional because of Will Smith. Smith's performance as Chris Gardner, a good man who has found himself at the wrong end of the financial ladder, is exceptional. Gardner decides he wants to be a stockbroker, despite having no college education, and pursues this dream doggedly. Smith's moving performance perfectly captures this air of perseverance and determination. As we watch Smith descending into the bowels of society, we are heartbroken along with him, and later elated when successes come. Also turning in an excellent debut is Smith's real life son, Jaden, who is charming as Christopher Gardner. Overall, the chemistry between Smith and his son and his fantastic portrayal of a man who refused to quit or hang his head makes The Pursuit of Happyness a great film."
3,"Good movie,, but seems incomplete to be a great movie","The Pursuit of Happyness has to be seen, cause its a real story aboutreal people. When Will Smith decided to tackle this one, we would hearmany facts about Chris Gardner and when i watched the movie anticipatingwhat i heard, some things that should have been in the movie were not included in the movie. I did'nt mind that. But then they end the movie after seeing Chris Gardner in hard times most of the movie,we dont get the satisfaction to see any glimpse of him in happier time aftersucceeding at what he worked soo hard....hey we just wanted a few minutes, but they slapped on the end of the movie with a few words...Movie is a must .....but i find the quick ending a shot below the belt forus viewers."
5,Focus and Determination really works,This book was a journey of the heartfor me. I went thru every phase ofhis challenged life with him. I feltit all. It was masterfully done. Itshows us all that we can accomplishany and all things if we believe it.The fact that he had to literallycarry his child around and thru mostof his exhausting experiences was adaily mountain to climb-and he climbedit. A powerful story for theseeconomic times. GREAT MOVIE & TRUE.
3,A bit overrated...,"Typical Oscar garnering story...its not like you thought he WASN'T going to succeed at any point...I mean, would Dean Witter allow their name to be used if they flunked him and threw him back out on the street?!?! OK, aside from the story (though based on true events) being overly melodramatic and Will Smiths one note acting (Was this REALLY one of the best acting performances of the year??? REALLY??) it was unoffensive enough to be broadcast on a plane flight with little to no editing...in fact thats what this movie is perfect for...passing a few hours without being asked to think too much...It has a great moral--work hard, expect nothing, don't ask for handouts, accept what life throws at you and move on--and for that, I applaud the film. Will Smith's son is also very good here as a precocious little boy and the chemistry between the two is excellent...A good film with a great message...just not a GREAT film with a great message..."
5,"Wow, what a beautiful, inspirational movie!","There aren't too many movies that I get really excited about, but this one is exceptional. It's so beautifully made; it's touching, but not so melodramatic that it's gushing; you really get to feel everything the lead character is feeling. I was pulling for him, and wanted him to survive and prosper. It's so inspirational, and the music is incredibly perfect. The only thing I can criticize is that ""Bridge over troubled Water"" was waaaaaayyyyy too short; it was so beautiful. Everything else about this movie is perfect, especially Will Smith. Wow!"
4,"Inspirational yes, a bit slow though","The real life story of Chris Gardner is an inspiration, those were very difficult times for most of America and we prevailed, Chris prevailed even more so than the rest of us. Will Smith has become an excellent actor worth following and his son did a fine job on his first time out.I agree that this movie comes to an abrute conclusion and would have liked to seen more of his success and the success of his son, but I have a feeling that would lead to disappointment.My family enjoyed watching and I will probably watch it a couple more times, but don't see it as my go to movie for getting me out of a rute or inspiring me to do great things, just the things that I have to do."
5,Great Movie about a man who is true to his word,"This could have easily been the movie of the year. Will Smith plays Chris Gardner, a down on his luck Medical Equipment Salesman who decides to push back when his life gets rough. He pursues through very tough times, and manages to keep his son happy, and finally is able to find real happiness with the success of his word, his morals, and excellent work ethic. An inspirational story for all. The characters in this film are all believable, and it is great to think that this is based on a true story. Weather you have read the book or not, this film is worth renting or buying. You won't be dissapointed."
4,3 stars for the movie and one for,special features- interview with Chris Gardner and the Rubik's cube story.
5,Encouraging,"Never give up hope, great message. Heart felt. The acting was very natural. Made feel the yearning of wanting to provide better for his family. Great message in saying I am willing to work hard for that success, but my family comes first. Great support through out the film. Thank you for not using fowl language!! That is so rare, and so very appreciated. I can recommend it to my friends and family, who are many, without feeling they will be offended, and that is a great feeling too. Thank you, very very good."
4,Will Smith=incredible,"A few days ago I was Walking through Wal-Mart and i saw the display for this movie, and I thought to myself, hmm Will Smith how good can this be. But honestly this movie is one of the few movies that can accually inspire people to do things. From the cross-refrences to the Delcaration of independence, to the Oscar Worth proformance by both Will Smith and his son Jayden. From the time I put this DVD into the player, i could NOT stop watching. I hope you all get out there and see it. Its deffiantly worth buying, nevermind just renting."
4,Feel-good tale: There is no substitute for hard work!,"Based on a true story, ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" features Will Smith as Chris Gardner, a struggling San Francisco medical equipment salesman beset with financial problems. Tired of the struggle, his wife moves out and leaves him with their little boy. As they spiral down the financial shaft, they are reduced to sleeping in homeless shelters and in subway bathrooms.Gardner lands an unpaid internship to become a Dean Witter stockbroker. Juggling the demands of fatherhood, keeping financial wolves at bay, selling his remaining inventory of bone density scanners and cracking the books to become a broker, Smith's character pursues his vision like one who has run out of alternatives.Yes, it's a bit hokey and at times requires you to swallow the implausible, but this is an uplifting film that can inspire you to overcome obstacles and achieve your goals."
3,Consider the whole pic,"Love the movie storyline! Packaging and service great! Unfortunately, the product arrived in a porous brown envelope that smelled of residual cigarette smoke. When envelope was opened, the product itself reeked of a stronger smoke smell. After 2 days of airing out, the smell dissapated. Don't know if smoke originated from seller or carrier. Either way, it was an unpleasant surprise."
5,Great movie - more UMDs needed !!,"This film is as good as everyone proclaimed, and great for teens with PSPs instead of the usual action gore and violence. Therein lies the problem, though -- Amazon needs to stock more UMD films that everyone might like for their PSPs...."
4,An uplifting tale based on a true story.,This movie is partially so effective because of the man who inspired it. Its always good to hear about someone succeeding with hard work and intelligence regardless of their color or economic background. The main character is also a loving father and this makes him even more sympathetic. We all want the underdog to win and to prove that the American dream is really attainable to all. Or at least anyone who enjoys this movie would have to feel that way. Otherwise its just another sappy fairy tale.
2,Blu Ray version terrrible,"For a review of the movie read the other comments. This Blu Ray version is terrible. It looks like it is in 480 plus it is grainy. This disc is just like the Click Blu Ray version. What is up with Sony pictures? Their blu ray discs look terrible. I did once talk to a sales rep at the Sony store and he told me that Sony Blu Ray producted discs would play through component and not only through HDMI. I guess the reason why is that their discs are not in 1080. Don't get the blu ray version, stick to standard."
5,beautiful movie of course i don't except any less from will smith,"what a beautiful movie oh god , i had to see this movie 5 times, what a sad story and what a brilliant acting done by will smith as always, this guy is a genius and the fact that the son was his real son made it even more real, it made me cry , i can't say enough, how beautiful this movie was, another unbelievable golden acting done by will smith a perfect movie done by a perfect actor, i'll give it 5 out of 5 which is not nearly enough for that magnificent acting will did on this movie."
5,The Pursuit of Happyness,"Awesome. GREAT!!! A wonderful DVD about courage, determination, love and all based on a true story. It shows that a Father's love can and does make a beautiful impact on thier child's life. I recommend this to anyone and everyone. A great family movie that teaches many meaningful lessons to kids and adults alike."
5,Heartfelt,"This movie represent so much people, the struggle and the drive that Will Smith's character went through was so real. This movie is sad and inspirational at the same time. I wanted to cry but I can't (Joke). I highly recommend this movie, it's very touching."
4,Wonderful and relevant today,"I've only watched this movie once and it was probably over 3 years ago. But it has stuck with me. I think about people who complain and don't do anything about it. This movie is truly and inspiration for those have hit rock bottom and even people at the top.I suggest also watching Trading Places (1983) with Eddie Murphy, Dan Aykroyd, Jamie Lee Curtis after for some good laughs and a look at why this country is in sad shape today."
4,Excellent and thought provoking.,"This movie has amazing depth and resonated with me on many levels. Will Smith's performance is excellent. The film is well done, drew me in and held my interest to the end.Chris' struggle is as real as it gets. His perseverance and fortitude in spite of grueling life trials, is inspiring. It's also a testament to the power of a child's love and trust and the importance of keeping family together.I HIGHLY recommend this film, and for family viewing."
4,"TODAY'S ""KRAMER Vs. KRAMER""","Father and Son performances that will take your breath away. Not the greatest movie, a little slow at times, but Will and young Jaden Smith make for one of the best duels of the year. Thandie Newton very believably plays the haggard and stressed wife and mother. Great acting ensemble all around.The kid definitely has a future ahead of him should he pursue it. Will Smith is very convincing in his characterized climb from the bottom to the top. Probably his best work to date.It's never too late to achieve our dreams!"
3,"Sappy, Boring, Improbable, and Too Long -","This starts out as a nice story about a single dad with incredible effort and talent who goes from nothing to owning his own brokerage firm in S.F. Will Smith and his young son's performance are excellent, but the plot has been tinkered with to the point that its not believable (too many sudden roadblocks), and becomes overly heart-tearing."
4,"TOO MUCH TRAGEDY, NOT ENOUGH HAPPI(Y)NESS",OK movie with very good performances by Smith and his son. The scene with both of them sleeping in the subway's restroom is more than enough to have made Smith Oscar-nomination worthy. Only complaint (spoiler warning !): it makes us go through 2 hours of pain & heartbreak while rewarding it with what felt like only a couple of minutes of happiness & redemption.
2,Information is mixed for all the different models,"Lots of good stuff, needs to be more obvious about each model."
2,Lots of good information. Information on 240SX is spotty,"Love the book, however the different models are not differentiated well, so you really must read carefully."
4,very usefull info.....,i like the use of this manual its easy. any one could under stand it even a female like I. I myself can repair most stuff. thanks selina
5,More than I expected. Truly too cute for every little football fan out there!,"In my hectic Christmas shopping frenzy, I didn't even realize that the footballs light up when the little one walks. These shoes are too much. Our little football fan loved them and wore them all Christmas day even though they were slightly too big. The Rebok quality is apparent throughout and from the appearance of the shoes, I am sure they will still be going strong and ""flashing"" when he has grown out of them. I highly recommend this item."
3,flimsy but adequate,"The pocket clips are loose and can rattle a bit. The crumbers themselves are light, but do the job. Also the color is a bit more orange than gold."
4,Very Helpful,"This book helped me to learn that one can't try to change their boss, but they can change their own communication style to enable the boss to feel more secure."
5,My Way or the Highway,"I wanted a book that helped me to understand my controlling boss. However, the book was much more than that, providing a profile of my boss, a way in which I can manage the frustrations of working with and for him but also recognising characteristics in myself that lean towards micromanagement. I have managed to put in place some check and balances to assist me to manage better."
4,Following the Great Commission,"For any Christian whose heart is to follow Christ, this book is a must!!! It is a biblical, practical, and easy to understand guide for introducing others to the Lord Jesus Christ, and how to ""...Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.""(Mark 16:15)I am a member of Lancaster Baptist Church, where Pastor Chappell continues to inspire my family to actively seek out those ""...whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord..."" (Rom 10:13)This book would be a blessing and a wonderful gift to a Bible-Believing church's Pastor!"
5,This is an entertaining movie with fun extra features,"Brendan Fraser is a scientist looking for the center of the earth in this entertaining film. Josh Hutcherson is a fine young actor who is really good in this movie. Anita Briem is a talented lovely actress. I have never heard of her before, but she gives a good performance as a mountain guide. The visual effects are excellent. This movie is a treat to watch in 3D. I love the floating rocks and the furious flying fish in the movie.I really liked the special features on this DVD. It features a commentary on every scene of the movie with Brendan Fraser and the director Eric Brevig. This DVD also features an interview with Josh Hutcherson about his life as a young actor. There are some fun games to play based on the movie included in this DVD too. There is another documentary talking the history of scientific discovery on this DVD. This is also interesting to watch. I really enjoyed watching the movie and checking out all the special features."
1,DO NOT WATCH IN 3D,"i had high hopes for this movie.I just got a brand new 61"" Samsung DLP and we tried to watch the movie in 3d.The 3d process they use is the WORST 3d experience i've ever had.... It was like watching a black and white movie that was tinted purple and green. After 15 minutes the colors started giving us all headaches and we turned the movie off.DO NOT BUY"
3,"good family movie, terrible 3d","Goof family movie, really bad 3d. the opening credits are great then after that washed out and wow did it give you a headache."
3,"Charmingly cheesy, with good home 3D effects","If you want a classic version of the tale, check out the 50s version with James Mason (and, regrettably, Pat Boone). The latest remake is pure Velveeta - gloppy but tasty. I missed the 3D version in theaters and was surprised by how well the 3D works on this DVD. The glasses have magenta and blue lenses, unlike the typical red/blue lenses of most home 3D movies, the ghosting (double images) is minimal. Certainly the 3D looks far better than on Sony's ""Polar Express."" You need the glasses (four pair) that come will the movie for maximum effect. This isn't going to duplicate the snazzy effects you saw in a 3D theater, but it's fun all the same."
3,It's ok.,"Journey to the Center of the Earth is a good action flick for the family but otherwise this film is pretty average. Brendan Fraser always plays the smart but dimwitted guy, his facial expressions say it all. Josh Hutcherson is a great younger actor, he actually carries this movie instead of Fraser. The action and special effects are excellent but the storyline is rather mundane, it's a mixed bag for me."
5,Great Family Adventure Movie,This is one of those strange movies that catches your eye watching a trailor and then you actually cheak it out and get surprised how much fun it is to watch
2,Great movie if you're an insomniac.,"The movie was just plain boring. I need to watch the original again to compare but this was just painful to watch. I was hoping something striking was about to happen. Don't waste your time. No hit on Brenden Frasier who is a great actor; this is just a bad movie, in my opinion."
4,Nice 3D film ... but ...,"I liked this 3D film, but I feel this movie was way to short of a film.It needed to be longer."
4,decent adventure movie,"Interesting plot, includes believable characters, decent special effects. An educator guide is available for earth science week. Plot includes enough earth science facts that it could be shown in a middle school classroom after a unit on rocks and minerals and the structure of the earth."
4,Great movie!,"I expected 2 discs, but didnt realize the one disc can be used as 3d and just blue ray. Good movie"
3,Brendan Fraser barely saves this movie from being a complete dud.,"This movie seemed like a 3-D exercise. It could work well if it was toned down to maybe seven or eight minutes but as a feature length? Not so much. At least Fraser, a very underrated and talented actor, mines some sadness, humor, and determination from his Trevor Anderson character. Josh Hutcherson is just along for the ride as is newcomer Anita Briem. This one is made for the kiddies. There's not much here that will scare them nor that will cause them great awe; there's even less here for the adults. As much as I may be bagging on this movie the Blu-ray is sharp and I always appreciate fare that doesn't make you cover your children's eyes and ears. So three stars on these efforts alone. Turn it on for the kids and leave the room after the first 20 minutes. You will have seen enough and it's safe for them to watch more.Or you could just skip this altogether and read the book."
4,Good flick,This is a good action adventure flick for the entire family.. I personally bought this for my mom because she loves this film and so does my nephew.. It is good movie worth a purchase really if you like Brenden Fraiser and if you have seen the old classic Journey to the center of the earth then by all means purchase this item.. =)
2,"As believable as a cartoon, which is should have been","Yes Fraser's last decent movie was the Mummy (first one). This just adds to the list of stupid films he has been in unfortunately. The situations went from crazy mine shaft rides that rival Warner Brothers cartoons, to the director failing to catch someone's chest strap on their backpack unhitched in a rough climb. . . . But who is looking for stuff like that?Its silly incredible (and I do mean that literally) chase scenes lent to the comedy for me because it truly was closer to a cartoon than a movie. Temperatures rising to 115 and not a bead of sweat on anyone's skin? Come on! Even a light coating of vaseline would have done the trick, they didn't even have the budget for that?I guess if it was 3-D then it didn't matter. But it certainly left me unfulfilled. I wouldn't recommend it, unless I wanted to dumb down someone's kid. Read the book instead."
3,Satisfactory Rating,"Watched this with my husband and my 20yr old daughter (she loves Brendan Fraser). It was funny. One part did make me cry (i'm usually a sucker for being emotional). However, it was a little cheesy with the special effects. With today's technology I expect a little more out of sci-fi movies. Not enough action packed adventure for me. My husband didnt say much."
1,3-Disappointment,"I admit I bought (pre-ordered, even!) the DVD mostly in order to check the 3D-gimmick rather than the movie itself. I am sorry to say that, despite the low price, it is a huge disappointment: the 3D version of the film is essentially monochromatic and the 3D illusion is dismal, as there is a double image (ghost). The result is much worse than even an experimental 3D-TV series of broadcasts some years ago...I fully agree with the reviewer who proposed that a higher-priced but better-realised package would have been much preferable; maybe even a CRT-screen implementation for those (like me) who still prefer a good CRT over a run-of-the-mill LCD screen.Do not buy this item. Maybe that will give the producers the message that they must do a better job next time."
3,amazon disappoints me for once.,"VERY disappointed when i received a 2D version instead of 3D. SHAME on amazon for steering their customers in the wrong direction. oh well i guess, i enjoy the movie anyways. i'll just get the 3D later. 5 for the movie 0 on amazon."
1,No Thanks,"I bought this as a blind purchase based on the great reviews on Amazon. What a disappointment. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's neither fun nor funny. It's simply boring. Yes, it has some good 3D effects, but that alone doesn't save the film or justify its high price. $43 for one blu-ray? Seriously? Thank goodness I bought it elsewhere for less. I'm giving it one star to balance out the ridiculous 5-star ratings."
1,Spoiled by Rio,"The problem is I saw Rio in 3D first and that spoiled my viewing of ""Journey"" because the quality of 3D in Rio is far and away better than ""Journey."" If you want a great, first time, experience with 3D, buy Rio. It's a wonderful kids/adult movie and the 3D will simply blow you away. Besides, ""Journey's"" plot is way too simplistic, bordering on ridiculous. Or, you could just buy ""Journey"" first and than buy Rio."

3,Comes with four glasses. Is that enough?,"It's way cool that this 3d movie is being released on Blu-ray in 3D! That makes this a purchase, rather than a rental. But what about households with more than four people who want to watch it? Seems kind skimpy to only include four pairs of glasses with no way to get more -- and to use a version of the glasses that are not compatible with other 3d movies out there like Tom Hanks' little train movie.I guess the bottom line is, though, after watching this, I gotta say the 3d version looks weak compared to the 2d version. The story doesn't improve by ditching the glasses, but at least it looks better."
1,extras are better than actual movie,"Skip the movie and go straight to the extra features. There's a terrific one on the whole ""hollow Earth"" movement that fueled Jules Verne's imagination to write the terrific book on which this lame movie is based on.No amount of special effects can save this as the movie just meanders all over the place. Brendan Fraser cannot carry movies unless they are comedies. The female actress (whose name I've forgotten already) is unmmemorable and if she's supposed to have an Icelandic accent it keeps morphing into British. The young kid is also hopeless in this.Really, it's not any of these actors' faults as the script is just brutal.Literally, I ended up doing chores around the house as this ran as after awhile I just gave up. It's beyond dull. (Plus as posting of Aug. 25, 2001, there are over 200 used copies of this for sale starting from 16 cents so that says a lot more than any review.)"
4,i like it,it came in promptly without a hitch. works fine and everything. only gets a four star cuz i dont wanna rate a movie perfect cuz you might not like the movie itself
1,brendan frasher's bogus journey,"After wasting time watching this remake, I was made to appreciate the classic ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"". The 1959 version with it's comically outdated ""special"" effects and corny acting and dialog I was made to appreciate at least for the ""gravitas"" and dread that movie was so infused with. As a kid it was kinda heavy. You feel like your embarking on a very dangerous expedition. Which makes sense considering your going to the center of the Earth (although of course that is all that is sensible about this fantasy story). But if you do a story about people going through the Earth and repeatedly almost being killed you want to convey the emotion of people being terrified to death. Remember the music from the old movie? And the duck? No duck in this one. And no dread. Just a silly, mostly lighthearted second rate cgi roller coaster ride that isn't worth the price of a ticket."
3,Yawner for me.,"I really like Brendan Frasier and that's what attracted me to this film. While I do enjoy his humor, in a nutshell it was sort of a yawner for me. I'm glad I watched it but it's not a movie I'd recomment to anyone over say 17."
3,not all i was hoping for,"it was ok, kind of fun to watch being in 3D but u still see weird colors when you're watching it and it seems like the 3D animation wasn't done that well. I watched a 3D movie when I was in disneyland and it was done much better.The story line started out well enough but as the movie went on it got more and more unrealistic, to the point I was pretty much taken out of the movie and just laughed at how ridiculous it was. I would recommend this movie for children."
5,we had a good time with the 3d version,"we were watching on a 1080 p lcd tv, I don't know if that had any impact, but the 3d effects worked very well. Yes there is color distortion, but lots of rocks and dinosaurs and yoyos flying in our living room made the adventure worth the time it took to watch the movie. I don't know if we will watch this in 3d all of the time, but we don't need to. The 3d copy has a 2d version on the other side of the disc.My kids are indiana jones fanatics and loved this movie too. Yes it is sophmoric and shallow but it is a good ride at the same time.I'll give this 5 stars simply because it is exactly what we expected when we purchased it. Not perfect, but good fun."
2,"Beware, this is NOT 3D version anymore","PRODUCT ALERT:Early shipments of Journey to the Center of the Earth were both 3-D and 2-D, but current copies are 2-D only.That alert was not there when I ordered. Amazon should not have sent me the 2D version when I ordered the other. Oh but they are willing to exchange it, for SOMETHING THEY DONT HAVE!! This should have been a separate product link or they should have notified me."
3,highly dissappointing 3D,Journey to the Center of the Earth (Limited-Edition 2-D and 3-D with Glasses)The 3D on this disc is really lacking. I've seen better in some of the old BW sci fi films. Many scenes are blurry and double vision and often the color just looks yellow. Save the money and just rent the 2D.
4,Kooky Family Fun,"This was a great movie! As with all movies of this genre, there were some silly & tired lines, but on the whole very enjoyable. Kept you one the edge of your seat laughing.Great flick to watch with the kids or by yourself."
1,2D Not 3D!!!,"Like others, I had to return the purchase because it was only the 2D version. If I'm going to own it I may as well own the 3D version. Easy return with Amazon but am a little miffed that they still have not corrected this listing. I can see from the postings that I'm not the only person that this happened to. I mentioned the issue in my return as well as the fact that they try and pair it up with convincing you to buy a set of 3D glasses. Glad I didn't fall for that as well since I thought the movie was to come with four glasses. Anyway, cannot review movie as I haven't seen it but buyer beware if you are trying to get the 3D version!"
1,Don't waste your money unless you prefer the 2D version,"Instead of releasing the 3D movie as it was in the theaters with the grey lens process, the studio remastered it to include the red & blue lens 3D technology. I was so irate at this that I returned my copy as soon as it was opened. I felt like I was kicked in the gut. I enjoyed the 3D in the theater and to be treated to a substandard 3D experience was insulting. Only buy this if you are interested in the 2D film."
3,"Kid slapstick action, not hard scifi like the classic oldie","This film is an odd combination of adventure and comedy, aimed directly at a kids' audience rather than a deeper film that adults might enjoy as well. It is fantastical, full of coincidences and miraculous survivals, and in the end completely unbelievable for hard scifi fans. That being said, it does have some of its own magic and my kids absolutely loved it for a rollicking fun ride, even if for us, the parents, it was mere background noise. Recommended."
2,40/60 for Journey to the Center of the Earth (3D),"My wife and I watched the 3D version of Journey to the Center of the Earth. She loved it. I hated it. The 3D glasses gave me a headache, but my wife thought it was special. So 50% loved the movie, and 50% say save your money. We both thought that the 2D version might have been easier to watch. However, we both agreed that the plot was so weak that neither of us wanted to run the Blu-ray DvD again. So I gave this movie 2 stars. Buy only if you need to see a weak plot with plastic 3D glasses."
1,all washed out,"I was all excited when my copy of ""Journey..."" came I immediately played the 3D version. What a disappointment. What happened to the color? I then tried the 2D version and while the color was better it was not as vibrant as a color movie usually is. We need a reissue soon."
3,Good 3D choice :) oversimplified plot :/,"This movie is by far the closest I've come to a 3D experience. Hint: Things literally come as close as two inches away from your face. This is probably due to the fact that this movie was actually recorded with a 3D camera, so it did not have to be reformatted. The storyline, however, is very premature and cliche in the sense that it lacks the thrill of a mystery (at least to an adult, which, by that, I mean myself). Overall, good choice for a 3D movie, but don't expect there to be a complex plot in this movie. Thanks for reading!"
1,"Poor writing, poor acting, is this 2012?","I'm wishing that I had rented this before buying it on demand. I had expected more from Brendan Fraser... ok, maybe not, its hit or miss with him. The movie is filled with predictable and poor writing, combined with non-stop cliche. It is as if the horrible writers who know only non-stop cliche decided to make a new movie titled 'Journey to the Center of the Earth'. I really wish I could get a refund.I wouldn't even recommend it to rent."
4,Good even if corny,"I really liked this movie. Yes it was a bit corny in places but that is what made it more appealing. And it was suitable for my grandson to watch. Because I liked this one I bought it's ""sequel"" Journey 2 with Dwayne Johnson. I would not recommend that movie at all."
3,I bought this,I bought this movie because it would give me the set. Plus it is ok and not as good as the second movie
2,ok,It was ok to watch. and now I warite the more words that this requires me to write because I am awesome.
4,Entertaining diversion,"Certainly not an ""A"" class movie, but it's a good escape ""B"" movie. There's a good mine car sequence, very reminiscent of Temple of Doom, but it pops in 3D."
4,Journey To The Center Of The Earth,Brendan Fraser fans must rejoice over this one. Not nearly as good as Inkheart but still worthy of any fan's collection. This is a fun film but the original is still better. I was hopeful it would be much better but was more a family film than a serious tribute to the author's work.
4,A cool Journey!,"I was always a fan of the very first ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"",when I saw it back in 1959. This version of course has taken several elements from that movie, and transposed numerous story lines;which,I believe added to this one!The special effects were very good;and, using the 3-d glasses supplied within the DVD case(along w/the movie)made it---even more fun!I very much enjoyed this. The actors;I feel, did a good job,and I would recommend it.But, if your not sure...then, rent b/4 you buy.But, for the price and it being blue ray...well worth the cost...I feel."
2,Overrated movie.,"You will like the movie, in my opinion, if you watch movies for the special effects and not the plot. Plot is severely lacking. It appears that the production company counted on the special effects in 3D to sell this movie when the approved the script for production."
3,Movie is fun but 3D is not!,"After twenty minutes of trying to work out the deep purples and blacks in the 3D version we switched to the very clear 2D version. In our spare time we will continue to play with the brightness and color controls on our 46"" Sharp Aquos but ""out of the box 3D"" it's not."
3,Fun but too fast,"This film was fun, allot is happening, but it moved too fast. They could have paused in the action longer to build suspense and drama. Good movie for children but lacks the adult hooks."
4,Journey to the Center of the Earth 3D Blu-Ray,"Quality was quite good, 3D not as good as the theatre experience but very good for the home. Recommended, but check out the original if you've never seen it."
2,Didn't look like the picture,"I ordered this movie used thinking it was the in blu-ray case that the picture showed. Got it pretty cheap too which was nice. When I got it the movie was in a hollywood video dvd case with the words ""blu-ray"" on it. And they stuck a blu-ray movie in the dvd case I was very mad that it came like that considering that wasn't was in the description. I contacted the seller and told them about it and they refunded my money back to my account. Lets just say I will not be buying from this seller again."
1,Garbage,"One word to describe this movie: Garbage. I already wasted too much time watching this movie, so i do not want to waste any more time describing this film."
1,As New? MY FOOT!,"I purchased this item while in England because Amazon.com was the party fulfilling the DVD order. That used to give me confidence, but not any more. The DVD was NOT as new, it was scratched beyond being payable. I had to pay someone to professionally clean the disk so it would be usable. The most irratating part was that I was expected to pay international shipping to get the disk back to them. Grrrrrrrrrrr, because it was cheaper to have the disk repaired than to mail it back to the States. No compensation has been offered. Grrrrrrr again!"
3,Verneians...,"Journey to the Center of the Earth is yet another take on Jules Verne's classic novel. The film brings to the screen a scientist whose brother was lost trying to retrace the steps of Verne's characters.Don't look for the movie to make any sense; it doesn't, as it is totally unbelievable even for a Verne's novel.Brendan Fraser, Josh Hutcherson, and the rest of the cast carry out their performances well though the acting is nothing extraordinary. The revelation is in relation to the lovely Anita Briem who steals the show and proves beyond any doubt that she has the potential to have a great career in acting.The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the special effects, and the music are all right, though there was plenty of room for improvement.In a nutshell, it's not a movie you would want to add to your collection, but it will provide for an evening's entertainment for pre-teens. 3 Stars"
2,Watchable,"Entertaining enough to watch once, this must have been really cool on the IMAX in 3-D. Brendan Fraser is reliably affable, and the tour guide is really cute, but the movie special effects are TV-show quality, at least in 2-D. Watchable, but nothing special."
3,So-so,"Better 3D glasses might have helped. Not bad, but, overall I expected a little more in the way of plot, acting, scenery, and especially effects. Blu-ray in general is so great because of its sharpness and its wonderful color rendition (saturated and sharp). This movie didn't quite have the presentation I expect from a Blu-ray movie."
3,DVD purchase,"Had to order this after watching the second dvd in the series. Good dvd, good delivery, movie was not as good as sequel!"
4,Old Time 3D works,"Just a short comment. The 3D can be seen on a regular set and Blu-ray player. It's the Old School Blue and Red lenses glasses. It works pretty well on my 55"" Flat Screen, although the colors are somewhat duller than playing it as a 2D. It comes with 4 sets of cardboard glasses which are small for my adult head. I cut the ear hooks off a pair and taped on an extension and it worked fine. Anyway, it is a novelty seeing the 3D, but with the new technology out now, I think you will have to buy the equipment to see it in the future and get an even better experience for it."
4,Fun movie,It was a good movie which was fun for the whole family. I enjoyed the second of the series too.
3,Did not like the glasses,"The one thing I did not like was the fact that you could only use the 4 pair of glasses that came with it to see the 3D, you could not use your original 3D glasses that came with the TV like you can for other movies. I ended up buying another DVD that I was able to use the other glasses."
4,Good family show,We all watched this off amazon instant during a stressful time. It was a good escape.Nice adventure story with some comedic parts.
5,Adventure,Very well satisfied with service. Was surprised how fast I received the dvd. Would recommend this service.
2,Dissapointing...as most 3-D movies are,"I first bought this blu-ray because it touted 3-D. Unfortunately, the 3-D colors (pink or green) distract you from the movie. The story of the movie was boring. I would not recommend it to anyone."
1,DISAPPOINTED,Unfortunately the 3D section of the film was monochrome even with the proper glasses and that was totally disapointing......Nevertheless the film can be seen pleasently....
3,Good fun movie...pretty good 3d,"Like others...i tried watching the 2d version with 3d glasses as the disk is not very clearly mark....very small writting..bad eyes.Anyway the 3d effects with the glasses were pretty descent on my 42 inch tv.So bottom line....Good movie...good 3d....still enjoyed this movie after watching it twice...1 normal...1 3d...A Keeper, good for multiple views."
2,Sophomoric Action,"I wanted to see this when it first came out, and I'm glad I didn't. This film seemed like one big advert for a universal studios feature ride. There was zero believability whatsover as the main characters fall for thousands of yards and like cartoon characters survive without bumps or bruises. Sled on the fossilized skull of some unbelievably large dinosuar, ride a broken coal cart like it was a roller coaster etc.The main characters were likeable. The absent-minded professor, the trailguide, the unhappy nephew. But everything was dumbed-down and cartoonized presumably to appeal to an audience of children.I found myself fast-forwarding scenes where characters were constantly yelling and screaming as they were being chased and hounded, an the really sappy scene in the middle.Kids might like the action-y bits. Myself, I found it got old about halfway through. 2 stars."
2,borderline 3D,this movie has just come out new version of old movie the 3D is ok not really as good as some of my other older movies made in the late 50sthis movie is also out in blue ray 3D i have it and it is fantasticbest 3D movie i have in my collection sharp as a tack and things just pop out of the screen at you right in front of your face. if can get this movie in blue ray 3D it is amazing..............
3,"decent 3-D, Okay movie",This movie was okay not great and the 3-D was decent not great.A good movie for family to see together.Hopefully one day they make a great 3-D action movie with the technology that's out know.
2,If they telegraphed the lines any more,"they could open up a Western Union. I watched this thing on a plane and even with the crappy audio, I could always figure out what was coming next. From the initially disaffected kid to the purdy icelandic ""guide"", the screenplay writers didn't so much write a script as they did a bunch of set-up and payoff lines with really lame jokes. And they even provided a rollercoaster ride a' la the Indy Jones movie. And if one carnival ride is worth doing, its worth over-doing with two more.Still, it provided an hour and a half of mindless entertainment which was successful at passing the time. Its probably fun for the young kids without being too scary but if you have other things to do, you're better of doing them instead of watching this."
3,Journey to the Center of your Popcorn Kernal,"Cheesy to its core. Brendan Fraser mugs his way through this family-fared piece of fluff, while CGI Dinosaurs and glow in the dark birds make up the ooh and ah factor. With a running time of barely 90 minutes, there's no filler at all, but frankly, there's no depth. Fraser, with his affable charm, at least gives the film a center. His nephew (Josh Hutcherson) and their Icelandic volcano guide (Icelandic actress Anita Briem) are given little else to do except run from danger and scream often.Given that ""Journey To The Center Of The Earth"" was set up as a kids effects movie (I did not see the 3-D version, but the 3-D moments were obvious), this is pure, mildly exciting and non-frightening entertainment. Be prepared for the fact that this movie is meant to amuse 8 year old boys, and you'll be fine."
4,VERY NICE,Good acting and very entertaining! I don't know about the Hollow Earth Theory...but this movie makes me want to believe in a paradise below.
1,2D not 3D,Amazon shipped me the 2D version too. What's worse is I have to contact a different store for the return and I already opened it. I bought this movie only for 3D.
3,"Good story fine 2d, 3D needs help, good music soundtrack","The blu-ray version appears to have very average 3d affects. I did not see this in the movie theatre, so I have no comparison to the 3d theatre release.I would not recommend this if you are buying it for the 3d.For the story itself, it's not bad. Good performance by all the actorsdefinitely a good kids movie. Music score is quite good.Feature set on the blu-ray is limited compared to some other blu-rays I have seen. I rented this through netflix"
3,Good movie but the 3D sucks in a regular TV .....,The movie is fun but its suppose to be the 3D version DVD but on my TV looks horrible ..... Buy the regular version instead.
3,Journey to the Center of the Earth 3D,"After watching this movie in 3D, I doubt I would purchase another 3D DVD as I found the 3D effect would sometimes disappear if I moved my head slightly. The 3D effect didn't work as well as I had expected. The movie itself was fun to watch. My suggestion would be to watch the 2D version."
1,never received item,"I have as yet to receive the item, don't know if its any good or not, certainly didn't seem to be worth my time to order."
1,never received product or refund,I never received the movie.They sent me the wrong movie and never sent the correct one and I never received a refund
2,Red and Blue 3D Glasses Stink!!!!,I was excited to see that this BluRay was coming out in 3D being that the movie was amazing in the theatre. I was a little surprised when the 3D glasses that came with the movie were the old fashioned red and blue instead of the Disney Digital 3D glasses that were used in the theatre. I guess that technology can't be used in a home theatre setting as of yet.
3,Not What I Expected,"I found that the Three D was very poor, The picture without the use of the Three D was much better and truer colors, this was a disapointment to me. I've seen better Three D films."
3,OK,It is a good movie for the family although it was a little difficult to keep the 3D glasses on for the whole show. It was better in the regular format. My granddaughter liked it and I would recommend for a family movie.
3,3d effects,"The movie itself was very entertaining. I was very disappointed in the 3D effects however. The left eye worked fine completely blocking out the right eye's magneta images but the right eye always left some green image resulting in a double image effect no matter how much I changed the tint,color, brightness and contrast on my High Def TV.I would recommend the Blu-Ray 2D version but not the 3D because of the double vison."
2,"Decent adventure, but missable","The good: Lots of great effects and exciting scenes. I saw this in 2D, but lots of coming-at-you scenes must have worked beautifully in 3D projection.The bad: pretty much everything else. The story's logic faltered in just too many places. And, for a movie about a scientist, they got way too much of the science horribly wrong. Magnesium never occurs in metallic form in nature because it's so reactive, birds didn't exist 150 million years ago, and, well, lots more. And, despite his best effort to shake it off, Fraser'sGeorge of the Jungleseems to stand behind every attempt at a dramatic scene. If you want mindless excitement, great, but make sure you understand just how mindless.-- wiredweird"
3,not that great,"I was really expecting a blow out movie when I bought the blu ray, but I was really dissappointed. the special effects are really simple looking, and the story all together was just bland."
3,Not as good as the original,"Not as good as the orignal,Did't get anything from the 3-D on my Plasma T.V."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"1 STAR because the 3D process is terrible --- uses colored glasses --- distorted color. If Hollywood would standardize the 3D process with a good system like the 3D expert talked about in another review it would be great and I would gladly pay the $40 for the process.The old movie staring PAT BOONE is far superior to this story. If I were rating the 2D quality of this movie, I would give it 2 or 2 1/2 STARS. Other reviewers have provided good reviews on the movie/story so I will only say that I had the impression that the producer/director was rushing to finish the movie and should have added at least 15 min. to the film."
3,Respecatble action movie.,"Brendan Fraser. Not much more needs to be said about this film. The name alone makes one think of mediocrity, while not bad enough to be truly offensive, not good enough to be memorable."
1,"Awful movie, dreadful 3D effects","Fail, Fail, Fail. Truly terrible movie, as mediocre as the 3D effects.This one if for the trash."
3,Poor packing,"Received, the movie today, two sided DVD had the 3D side facing up! The 3D ""glasses"" scratched the disc. Loves the movie though."
3,Kids movie,"The filming is terrific. Some of the action scenes are very well done even in 2D they were very good. I expect in 3D they are even better.The story however is pretty ordinary as is the acting. I am not that keen on Brendan Fraser.I would suggest if you are going to see it, see it with the kids. They will like it. Make sure it is blue ray"
5,Journey to the Center of the Earth 3D,My family and I really enjoyed this movie in 3D. I have a LG 55 cinema 3D TV and sit about 12 feet away and there are several great Out of screen effects that made the kids jump. The depth on this Blu-ray is one of the best I have ever seen. If you enjoy 3D movies this is a great movie to add to your collection.
2,Can you say MINDLESS Action?,"There really is no plot to this- just action. That's it, action pure and simple. Not much characterization or progression. When it ended I asked myself - what was the point? I even liked the original Journey to the Center of the Earth more. At least that's a classic for a reason."
2,Disappointing,"The book seems to be a spiral bound photocopy. I bought this for my kid (my mistake) but the very small book doesn't even have color pictures as one would believe with the color pictures in the photo. If anyone is like my husband, you might think that the product comes with multiple blocks of wood. He misinterpreted the photo. I'm sending this back."
3,Cute product,"Cute simple product, came with everything needed for a first timer to get started. Shipping was extremely fast. The only reason I didn't give it higher stars was that I think it's a little pricey for what you get.Boyfriend has not tried to whittle pieces yet so I don't know if the instructions are easy to follow or not, but they seem pretty thorough. All in all, knowing what I know now about it, I would still purchase it!"
3,Flawed book on great topic,"I love the topic, but find the book promises more than the author can deliver. I wanted to only rate this at 2 stars, but the truth is, even knowing it's flaws, I'd still read it just to get at the topic. Funk needs a better author to give it the examination it deserves. Until then, I suppose one can data-mine here. As another reviewer said, I wish I had bought this used."
5,Uncut... The Bomb,"If you love funk, you MUST purchase this book. Vincent writes in an academic, yet fonkay style and emphasizes the roles of JB, Sly, and the P-Funk mob. The discography will drain your pocketbook."
5,These are great!,"This is a great price for the number and quantity of bungees that you get, especially compared to what they want for a single one at a big box store. They are of reasonably good quality to boot. I've used them to hold down my Xterra's hatch when I've got an oversized load in it, to hold closed a fence gate that was swinging in the wind, and other similar uses. None have broken on me yet! I keep one of each size in the back of my SUV (you never know!) and the rest in the garage."
4,Yes they are bunch of bungee chords,This is a nice assortment of bungee chords. I only had two minor issues. 1) the little black protector ends fall off all the time. 2) the ones that are like spiders - with the ring are kind of silly (IMO). And if you take them apart you can not get them back together (not easy to break that ring I might add).
4,Great straps at a great price,"These are bungee cords and they work very well. I blought two 10 packs, for 20 total and keep them in the trunks of our two cars. They have already proven useful several times. They are strong and the hooks do not bend easily (as with other cheap cords). The colors are fine, but I noticed that they are not color coded by length. As between the two packages I puchased there was no connection between colors and sizes - which would have been useful - and is why I deducted one star."
2,Quality Lacks,Fine for light duty jobs but would not purchase again. The hooks actually straightened out while being used within suggested parameters.
4,Good assortment,I enjoy the assortment of different bungees that came with this package. They can be used for so many different purposes. I have used them to keep large tubs of plastic storage boxes shut. Hung stuff with them. Wrapped stuff up in them. Used them as tie downs in the back of the truck. The only problem is they will dry rot from the sun.
1,Weird,This book is never less that 50 some bucks and now there is only one left and its for 129 dollars. how can they sell a book for that much. It has to be really rare or something.
5,Great work!,"This cd combines a great story with great music. Rick Wakeman really knows how to combine words and music so that they compliment each other to this scale of greatness, and it amazes me. As both a music lover and a book lover, I am quite impressed with this work and cannot wait to buy it. It'll also make a great father's day gift since my dad really likes Patrick Stewart."
5,Have no doubts -- it's as good as they say!,"My first online ""review"" is offered primarily for those who might be having doubts about the quality of ""Return to the Centre of the Earth"". I know that I was curious to see if Rick Wakemen could pull off what seemed such an obvious ""stunt"" (i.e., a sequel to his most successful album), so it was especially pleasing to see that he has done that and more. I've purchased some import CDs of Wakeman's works over the past decade, and none of them prepared me for ""Return."" It's not perfect -- Wakeman is *not* the best lyricist and the Dolby Surround encoding adds nothing to the experience -- but it's WELL worth the purchase. I haven't stopped listening to ""Return"" since picking it up at an import store last month (before I knew it was scheduled for a U.S. release)!"
2,Disappointed,"I had really high hopes for this album, but I guess those positive reviews I read were from true fanatics. I found the music repetitive and uninspired. Wakeman is at his best in a group setting (his work with Yes is truly brilliant) but this release in no way recalls the great moments of the original Journey. Not even Patrick Stewart can save this album. If you're thinking of purchasing, take my advice and listen to it before handing over your money."
2,Only Rick,"There is one thing that a great Musician can do,that is to be better to what he writes.Rick's return to the ""center of..""not only takes you back to the first ""Journey"" but opens a second chapter that sounds like a part he had known since the original recording back to the seventies.I write this in 2004 because his music is timeless and his creative mind will last for 1,000 years. Just like the song ""The dance of a thousand lights""which a had the chance to hear life in his solo tour,which brought a standing ovation in West Palm Beach,South Florida.This is a Masterpiece that is part of the best of the best. Buy It."
2,Good Ozzy Tune...Otherwise Skip This One,"I'm not familiar with much of Rick Wakeman's work, nor have I heard the original Journey To The Center Of The Earth CD, but this album is just not that interesting. The story, voiced byPatrick Stewart, fails to spark any excitement, and with the exception of Ozzy Osbourne's Buried Alive, the music just kinda lays there. I love the music of YES, but I would guess a person should start with other Rick Wakeman releases instead."
3,Ok album...,I'm a little disappointed though if Rick made 1000 albums 1000 times weaker I'd still love him. He's Wondrous! (I did love the Justin Hayward track though!):)--Ron Lavin
4,"Worthy sequel to ""Journey to the Centre of the Earth""","I picked this up thinking it was a remastering of the original ""Journey to the Centre of the Earth"", and was very pleasantly surprised to hear the new material. In fact, I would have liked a couple of the themes from the first journey incorporated into some of this music. The premise is that some anonymous journeyers, 100 years from NOW find the journals of the first trip and go to repeat it. Unfortunately, in the text the people stayed completely anonymous, which depersonalized it a bit for me (I loved the part in the first journey when Axel gets lost). But it's definitely a commanding performance and a worthy sequel."
4,Wakeman/Stewart take listeners on an amazing journey,"Rick Wakeman returns to the London Synphony Orchestra after 25 years of production experience. He brings with him Patrick Stewart, Justin Hayward, Ozzie, and a host of other talents. If this sounds like a recipe for sucess then you are absolutely right! ""Return to the Center of the Earth"" is well written, orchestrated and produced. Where ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" was sometimes unwieldy, ""Return"" is well balanced."
5,Excellent book for study of Ezra and Nehemia,"With its translation of the original,and notes and comments about each chapter, this book provides an excellent basis for discussion of the Biblical texts."
5,Cuban Memories,My husband is of Cuban decent but can never return to his home land. I purchased this book for myself and my children so they can sample the tastes their father grew up enjoying.
2,A Taste of Old Cuba,This is the story of a family of means in Old Cuba. There are some nice photos and old stories that were pleasant to read and that took me back to my own memories; however the book is not what I expected. The recipes are very basic and not what true Cuban cuisine really is.
5,Good battery for older PSP!,"I got this for my teenage son to take with him when we went home to the UK for a month. It has been great, it doubles the amount of playing time you can have. He has not take it off since we returned as he was so impressed. Another reviewer has stated that it does not fit the new PSP and he is right. It was only designed for the older model. For the amount of extra play time it has given I'd say it is extremely good value. (We also had to buy another case to fit the PSP as this extra battery does make the PSP considerably thicker and heavier.) Now been in use for 4 months and is highly recommended."
4,Worth the money!,"I ordered this for my ""PSP Fat"" This is pretty good product for the ""PSP Fat"" It diffently makes the PSP last a lot longer than the ""PSP battery"" itself. Only one thing I don't like about this product and that is how it makes the ""PSP"" decently heavy and sorta hard to use.But is it worth the money? and longer batter life for the ""PSP"".DEFIANTLY!!"
3,Not a Tub mount,"Was a little confused by description ""Tub-Wall Mount "" but found out from plumber this NOT a tub mount. It is a wall mount. There may be a way to tub mount it but it would require a work around, My plumber said to return it and get a tub mount one (Inlets are 3/4 IPS and are on 3 3/8 center to center). Which I easily installed by myself."
3,beautiful but a flaw,"I love it. I have had it on my wall for a while now, but the only problem is that this is a metric faucet with an ""L"" shaped wall to faucet piece that is only available in one size. I had to ""jerry rig"" it to work, because my vintage 1920s tub is too high for the protruding pipes in the wall. This item should have longer ""L"" shaped connectors available. All in all, measure well before buying, but it is a very good faucet that is well made and looks great."
1,Disappointed...,"I reviewed this product a year ago when we first received it and I was happy with the look and construction, however over the last several months it has slowly proved to be disappointing. First, the finish has started to flake terribly. Mostly on the hose, to the point that it's now a silver color instead of the oil brushed bronze. Then today the little tabs that say ""HOT"" and ""COLD"", well one fell off. It was just glued on!!! And to make matter worse, when it fell it landed in the drain and I can't get it out to re-glue it. So now I have an ugly faucet on my pretty, vintage tub!!! I'm just sick about it :("
2,Disappointed,"I love Madame Alexander, but I am so disappointed in this one. The coat looks so cheap. The hem of the coat is very obviously uneven. Very poor workmanship on the coat."
5,Mata Ortiz Pottery Review,"If you're interested in learning about the Mata Ortiz pottery, this is a must have book. It gives you more detail about the different artists and what to look for when purchasing this pottery. Definitely a must have if you are collecting this pottery."
5,Straight up fun for anyone,"This game is rocks the house. It's not really hard to learn and once you learn to play you'll wanna go again and again. Although the game suggests two to four players I've played with six people and had just a blast. My little brother, who usually sticks with sports, fell head over heels for this game and we play all the time.The figures and very detailed and and although some look a little fragil they're actually very durable. Rare characters aren't all that hard to come by and characters that would seem [week] sometimes have hidden powers that make them a suprisingly useful addition to your team. I highly recommend these to anyone intrested (but get a starter pack first) and give it an honest try, because you'll probablly go nuts for them."
2,"Too big, unimpressive finish","This camera is not made by Polaroid, as carefully explained in the box. (Too late for me, as I bought by mail and didn't know before hand). Some distributor had them made in China, and then paid Polaroid a royalty to be able to legally use their name. It's so bulky that it looks like a 35 mm! I haven't used it as I'm planning to return it. -Feb '06 update: I bought from TigerDirect, and returning is a nightmare: they put on hold forever (over 45 min.), then they placed so many obstacles as to make the process impractical. Stay away from them if you can."
1,Not a Good Buy,"I had the same problem. The Camera never worked for me. It always did what I didn't want it to do, and it was horrendous on batteries. It gives Polaroid a bad name, and I am not happy I was misled by the stores."
1,Awful,"I've had this camera for a few months. And it's terrible. The buttons frequently do not work, the shutter often gets ""stuck"" outside of the camera, and the battery latch keeps falling off. Will never buy from Polaroid again."
2,Way Too Small,"This toy is WAY too small for the price! Seems like ok quality, but we aware of size (or lack thereof). NOT appropriate for toddlers."
3,Really Cool Little Thing,"Although I love the idea of this, and am glad I purchased it, it's not particularly well constructed. The center tends to splay a bit in the back, which means that it won't properly and consistently braille 10s, 20s or 50s for me. I'm not sure if I'm the only person with this problem but I wholly support this tool."
3,"Great idea, but you should know","The pocket money brailler is invaluable in the U.S., where currency does not have braille (as it does in Canada).However, this plastic version is not as sturdy or effective as the metallic version of this product.In addition, the $15 cost here is three times what you can get it for from specialty websites that sell products for the blind, such as Sight Connection.Shop around and find the best version, and the best price."
5,Great!,Wow i love these things!! they are the best! i play with my friends and my brother all the time! Well the only bad thing is it takes a bit to click but that about it!
4,"Great, but there are better starter sets now","Heroclix is an excellent, five-star worthy game. However, this starter set is not.Back in the day, perhaps it would have been a good deal to get figures such as Firelord, but most Infinity Challenge characters are weak by today's standards. Even Firelord isn't that good anymore because of his wildly varying stats, which become annoying in battles.The reason I gave Educational Value 3 stars is because, while the set does include a guide to the game, it is dated, and some of the information is no longer relevant.Even with all of these negative aspects, the Infinity Challenge starter set is still a good buy... just not on Amazon. $25 is a silly price for this set. Troll and Toad sells this for a fraction of this price. Just beware - if you decide to get this starter set, you'll probably eventually resort to getting another one for the sake of a superior rulebook."
4,Great toy but....,"This was a very helpful kit, came in the mail quicker then i expected. I would have gave 5/5 for all but it isnt educational, and durability was low because the figures were dirty and it is hard to see the stats on the characters."
3,"VeryGood for Workstation and Server, horrible for Enterprise","Use this book for your Workstation and Server exams.However read this book for basics on Enterprise. I used the Dummies series along with this book. The Dummies series is good for giving you understanding on the advance concepts, not the basics. There fore buy this book, then buy the cheap but good quality Dummies series. read this book first. Its very good and written very well. However you MUST supplement your reading, especially for the Enterprise exam with the MCSE Windows NT Server 4 in the Enterprise for Dummies. As A side note for all those doing MCSE + I, did you know that you can get MCP, MCP + I, MCSE, MCDBA if you just focused on MCSE + I and do the Administering SQL Server 7.0 and Designing using SQL server 7.0 as your electives? Now if I can only find a good book on SQL Server 7.0"
5,great music,This CD is great. The rhythm is wonderful. I also have their CD titled Medicinal Purposes.
3,Not Dark Enough,Not as full bodied or bold as was expected. Was looking for something comprable to Cameron's Gold Cup. Very difficult to purchase coffee without looking at or smelling the beans.
5,Super GAMES AND LOTS OF THEM,"PRETTY GOOD SOLITAIRE is far better than ""pretty good"": it is excellent, with a full range of games that are comprehensive and varying in their difficulty. If you are a solitaire fan, this is a must-have. With the vast number of games available, you will never lack for challenges nor an opportunity to test your mettle against chance and a pack (or two) of cards."
5,Pretty Good Solitaire,All the family has had this game for many years.My grandaughter got a new computer and we bought this version for her as a Christmas present. She is delighted to have her own version.
2,Display not so good,"There are plenty of games to chose from, however, I do care for the graphics. In order to make the program big enough to see on my screen, it becomes blurry."
3,cards appearance much too small,Too much space spent on background. Cards are too small to be viewed comfortably if not sitting right on top of the monitor. Otherwise the games are great.
3,Graphics could be improved.,"I enjoy many versions of solitaire and have a couple game sets from different providers. Pretty Good Solitauire is ok. Plenty of games, including all my favorites. The graphics should be better. I had an earlier version of ""Pretty Good"" a few years ago and the graphics were better. I prefer the e-games, Solitaire Master. Game paly is the same but graphics are much better."
5,Great choice,This is a wonderful selection for those like me who are addicted to online games because I have 350 choices and do not get bored playing the same ole Solitaire games over and over. Most of the games are challenging and I love that.
4,Question,"Could you please tell me if the games ""Tut's Tomb"" and ""Cruel"" are included in this software?Thanks very much."
2,pretty good solitair,The format is very confusing and difficult to choose games. I've finally been able to make a personnal list of favorites to keep from having to weed through the long listing of games.
2,You get what you pay for I guess,"Got this for my pickup truck for plowing as cheap temporary solution, and that's exactly what it is. After only 2 months the beacon revolver motor runs really slow and the solder connections for the cigarette lighter jack fell apart easily. The unit simply cannot handle the colder weather. This would be fine for rare / occasional use in warm weather, but if you're looking for something to put on a plow truck in freezing winter weather, don't expect this to last more than a month or two."
2,Wolo brand Rotating beacon,After a week of rainy weather the rotating reflector stopped working. Evidently this model#3100 is not meant to be left outside continuosly
2,Save Your Money,this product is very low qulity. It is not very bright and is not bright even at night. you can buy much better l.e.d. versions at walmart or on amazon. l.e.d. is much better. shipping was fast.
4,Good product for the price,This work great as described. Tried it in day time and it's visible to decent distance and at night time distance visibility is 3 times day time. Work as its purpose.
4,Wolo Light,I work for the post office and i needed a light for my car this is very well worth the money!! The only problem i had was i needed the magnets to be a little stronger but they work on any regular vehicle! I just have a convertible and the cord wasn't long enough to reach to the trunk so i was having problems with the light staying but other then that i am planning on buying another vehicle for mail and it works great on a hard top car!
2,2-Star only. Not bright; best for novelty purposes.,This light is good for the movies but not for real life. There is no way that this will move traffic out of your way during daylight as its no brighter than a penlight. It was a good move by Wolo to break into the warning light industry but they should modify this to use the latest 3 or 5 watt Luxeon or Seoul Semiconductor LED modules.
1,Bulb will not stay in unit.,"I purchased two of these. One works great, the other one has a loose socket and the bulb will not stay in. I called the manufactor and they said I must send the unit in at my expense. Most places do a will call tag. If this is the way Amazon works I will not be buying anything else on it either. I paid for the units in good faith and it's not my fault their product is faulty. Jackie B."
3,Over-priced,This is just a piece of plastic. It is way over-priced by the time you pay postage. I would prefer glass. This topples over on the felt sometimes.
4,A spoof of the War of the Worlds,"If you're into a mindless spoof of the War of the Worlds,this is the movie. However there should have been morethough into making it a really good funny movie.Otherwise it's a likeable movie."
5,awesome,this is a great movie for all ages i recommend it to anyonne who loves family comedys with aleins
2,Dedicated Invaders Fan Beware,I was really excited when they announced the release of Spaced Invaders on DVD. I preordered it and got it soon after release. I have seen the movie many times but on my first viewing of the DVD last night was sorely dissappointed that it was the cleaned up over dubbed (badly and not even thoroughly)version. This seems to be a TV verson albeit widescreen. If you want the real thing then don't buy this! If you have never seen the movie then it is ok. I still laughed even though I was in mid dissappointment.
5,BEST COMEDY,THIS MOVIE IS BY FAR THE BEST FOR HOW STUPID CAN ONE RACE BE FROM ANOTHER WORLD TO LISTEN TO A RADIO BROADCAST AND THINK THEY'RE FLEET IS ATTACKING EARTH THE LITTLE GREEN DUDES HAVE YOU LAUGHING THROUGH THE WHOLE MOVIE
4,Funny,"This movie is a good, clean funny movie. There are no jaw dropping special effects. There are a lot of funny lines by those funny aliens!"
5,This is the Greatest Space Comedy next to Spaceballs!!!!!,This is a movie about five dumb martians who mislead orders and attack Earth. They are split up and all out chaos beggins. Hillariouslly funny!!. You got to see it!!!
2,Good for Children,"Great flick for kids of all ages, but for adults, it is only mildly entertaining and interesting. It is well-done, overall, but difficult to understand the dialog in many places. The characters are all likeable and do a good job with the script they have. For children, I would rate this 4 stars, but for everyone, it only gets a 2. Good DVD quality and nice music score."
5,Wonderful Entertainment,We love watching this video. It is a riot! The Martians are great fun. Recommend this one highly!
3,Not as pictured,The wrist support I received is not like the one pictured. I almost returned it - but needed it immediately and didn't have time to order another. I couldn't find one like this in stores at all. After wearing it and breaking it in it is great and works well for me.The sizing listed is good. the biggest issue I have with the size is that it is very long on the hand so it goes all the way to my pinkie meaning I can't wear it while typing - something I was specifically hoping to be able to do.I probably WOULD purchase this again if I needed a replacement or one for the other hand.
4,Wrist Support,Great Fit - Just need to trim the velcro closures as they over hang quite a bit and get caught if wearing anything with sleves
3,Sized Smaller Than Others,"I thought I was going to need wrist braces for a while. So I purchased another pair to use when I was going to be getting my hands dirty.(gardening, swimming at the river, etc) The first pair I got from the pharmacy were medium. I wear medium gloves. So, I purchased medium. They were WAY too small to use. A friend of mine needed some a few weeks after I purchased these and they fit her. (she wears small to extra small gloves) So, I sold them to her for the price I paid instead of returning them. Just be aware if you are going to buy these, get at least one size larger than you would normally."
2,Scratchy velcro side touches skin,"I do not have a large hand or wrist, but the medium size does not close completely and so the scratchy velcro side touches my skin. The wrist support I have for my other hand has an inner cloth sleeve, a better system of thin and wide velcro strips that go through buckles instead of the 4 bare straps here, and better materials. If you really want this I suggest you overestimate your hand size and not expect a quality product."
3,Runs Small,"These supports run to small. I measured a Medium but, when I received them I needed a Large."
3,Strange stuff,"This is a very oddball album, but then again, which of Grits early offerings wasn't =]It doesn't sound much like their later offerings, with most of the tracks seem to really pay homage to the jazz roots of hip-hop (one of songs is directly about this). The rapping style is a little more old-school than any of their other offerings...different, but solid. Any big Grits fan should enjoy this trip back in time."
5,A title for my review?,"Just an excellent book of how it was like in the early Beatle days. One of my absolute favorite Beatle books. I felt like I was there living the story of the Liverpool scene in those days. Of course I wasn't there, and I didn't live those days...but Sam Leach did! Thanks for the great book. Greg"
5,Sam -- You The Man,"If you're a Beatles fan, or even just interested in the Mersey sound aborning, you must read this book! I recently had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Leach at a Beatles Faire in San Diego, California. He is a charming, delightful man who tells his story of the birth of not just the Beatles, but the whole phenomenon of Merseyside rock 'n' roll, with wit and wisdom. Make no mistake, this is not just another me-too book from some Beatles hanger-on. This man was a player, an active participant who helped to make it all possible. Without him it would not have been quite the same. Who knows, fate is a fickle thing: without him it might not have been at all. Read the book and you'll see what I mean."
1,Disappointed,"Unfortunately this book didn't tell me anything I didn't already know. After 12 weeks of self guided revolting exercises such as eating whilst looking in the mirror, keeping endless food diaries and having role plays with myself I was no more enlightened as to how to solve the problem. The authors solution is to learn to make your ""adult""(sensible) voice in your head overule your ""child""(the one thats eats to make itself feel better). How you do this other than by sheer willpower and self talk is still a mystery to me. The book will be useful for those who don't understand why they eat compulsively and it will offer you some ways of coping. It will also make you see that you are not alone. My advice would be that if you really have an eating disorder you need to seek professional, human form, help in order to overcome it, this book is no substitute."
2,The Hunger Within,"I was disappointed with this book, also. I thought the written exercises were a little silly and disappointing. I expected the book to have more substance to it. Overcoming Overeating and It's Not about Food are better books for the money."
3,Retro bike,"Wow! This bike looks nice [...] When assembled the neck was to tight to turn, the rear wheel was too tight and the peddle bearing races where too tight also. For $79.00 you should get more quality, but it does come from China. I have been able to free-up the various bearings [...]"
4,Too small for 8 year olds,"I thought this looked like a great product so I ordered it for my eight year old for Christmas. The product description gives the ""from"" age but not the ""to"" age. Don't buy this for anyone over 6 years old. They will be too big for it. My 8 year old thought it was cool, but when we positioned the seat at it's furthest point, his knees were still practically touching the steering wheel."
1,Razor customer service sucks!,We bought an electric Razor for our son and he loved it. The circuit board died 6 months later. Customer service was not helpful at all. To fix the piece of junk would cost me $100. So we decided to trash it. What a waste of money!
3,O.K.,I won this in a competition and for the first day it was pretty fun but it was really small so it started to hurt I'd recomend it for 9 and under.
4,Razor Scream Machine,"I was originally looking for a ""Big Wheel"" which was quite popular back in the early to mid-70's; however, since the big wheel is no longer made, we settled with this toy. I purchased it for my 3 year old son who seems to love it. (Of course, he is rather tall for his age, so he manages it very well.) It is easy to ride and peddle. In fact, he seems to be able to peddle this toy much easier than other toys recently purchased that require ""peddling"". The only issue I see with this toy is that the front tire requires inflation and the manner in which this toy was constructed, a regular bicycle pump does not work. You have to take it to a bicycle shop or gas station to inflate the front tire."
5,Big Wheel !!!!,"Just like when we were kids only now they have a rubber inflated ""big wheel"". Kids get all the good stuff today!Adjustable seat makes it easy to play with by several ages."
4,Replacement Parts,"We are having a great deal of trouble with Razor. They have an affiliate company who handles shipping and company questions. My son's replacement rear tires are on back order, with no indication on when delivery will take place. I think I'm about ready to take him to Toys R Us to get a ""Green Machine"", since this company doesn't seem to be bothered with keeping 6 year old children hostage to their apparant problem with inventory."
3,Pinches Fingers,We bought this toy for our 5 year old son. He is very tall so the seat is perfect at the furthest setting. The 2 problems that we have had are 1) the back wheels are already torn up after only riding around the block on sidewalks twice and 2) He has already twice turned around to tell me something and ran over his hand with the back wheel which left pretty big cuts on his fingers. He loves riding this but it is one problem that deserves mention.
3,Knight falls down,"This is a wonderful piece; colorful, detailed, really visually striking, and with a cool jousting lance to boot. However, the knight falls over and can't stand alone once it's been removed from the packaging. This is a serious disadvantage for anyone who wants to display this delightful piece."
1,Only 80 Minutes???,"I was considering this DVD set but it's only 80 minutes long? Eight movies? No way! What a ripoff for $70!!! I think they must be ""previews"" of Tinto's films...not the actual productions."
4,A Bit repetitious,"This was one of the weaker entries in the U. of Mississippi series of interviews with filmmakers. Although there are a couple brief interviews from the Forties, the glory years for Powell, most of these interviews come from after ""Peeping Tom"" was savaged by the British critics. Sadly, as the book makes clear, Powell seemed to think that ""Peeping Tom"" was his grave and he was content to lie in it. The same questions usually elicit the same answers.However, there is some good stuff. There are two interviews with French critics from the Sixties in which they try to classify Powell as a horror director, and he rejects this classification. Also, there is an interview by William K. Everson that inspires Powell to go beyond the usual pat answers. You can tell Powell respects Everson.So there is good stuff here. However, if you have read Powell's two volume autobiography, this book might be superfluous."
3,Outrageous Language,"Yes, Shakespeare is the master of the dirty puns...however, I think it could have been written more tastefully. The Partridge book (Shakespeare's Bawdy) is essentially the same thing but gives reasoning behind the writing and is better written. That said however, it is definitely entertaining to read the world as Shakespeare saw it...if glaze-eyed students around the world knew what they were REALLY reading, I would think Shakespeare would become far more popular."
3,Best buy for the price,"With given price, this air filter is the best buy. Especially, the 360 degree air-intake is a feature I like the most."
5,One more,Another to add to my collection. EZ and Meg's books have innovative patterns plus the homey stories. Great books and go to books.
3,ok for specific knitters,"I have to say I was a bit disappointed in this book as there is only one pattern I will use, and the book was a bit expensive for that one pattern. If you like multiple color knitting, then this book will be fine."
1,Worst Album I've Heard In Years,"I read the line up of songs and naturally assumed that this would be a good collection of songs. I was wrong. All of the songs on this album have been redone by what could be hailed as the worst band in history. They make a complete mockery of the artist that made these songs. It's a complete waste of money. Buy this and you'll be disappointed, big time!"
1,"Don't buy, not orginal artist,","This is a cheap remake of good soundtrack songs. No orginal artist, and the Obscure group can't even come close to the orginal sound. Don't waste your money"
1,Misleading Album - Songs Not By the Original Artists,"This could have been a great compilation of soundtrack hits except for one thing: none of the songs are by the original artists. Every song is a cover version performed by a group known as The Obscure, and the band does no justice to the originals.The more disappointing cover songs on the album are The Obscure's version of ""Are You That Somebody"", originally performed by Aaliyah. Their version of ""I Don't Want To Miss A Thing"" by Aerosmith is even worse.I think it's shameless that the album's distributor intentionally packaged it in such a way that it doesn't appear to be a compilation of cover songs. I'm sure a handful of people buying this in stores will take the bait, but hopefully this review will keep Amazon shoppers from being ripped off."
5,'Portnoy's Complaint' is the book Roth will live by,"'When She was Good' is not very good.'The Breast' is a bad- taste joke which cannot approach the Kafka or Gogol that are its inspiration.'Portnoy's Complaint' is Roth's masterpiece. And even if he has shown through subsequent years great staying power, and considerable seriousness, and truly outstanding work ( Parts of 'American Pastoral' and 'Patrimony' for example) this is the one work in which he reveals what he best has to give.It is arguably one of the funniest books ever written, and deeply poignant one.It is an American classic and justifies Roth's place in this series."
1,Not What I Ordered,"The copy was sent without a jacket--as I was collecting the entire series, this was a disappointment. I returned it but was not refunded the purchase price. Will think twice before ordering again. Buying from a bookstore is better."
4,Teletubbies and Video,"My 2 year old loves this set we got it for him after he became addicted to the TV show on PBS. He will sit down and watch the video with the stuff toy and also try and repeat what it says when you squeeze it. It has helped us try and teach him to talk, even though the words may not be clear the baby still tries and imitate what it says. We as parents have enjoyed this program and toy. If your child is into Teletubbies its a must have for their collection."
4,Nice album,"Since I'm not Canadian, I wasn't aware that Ms. Sokyrka had released this album until I searched for her on a whim. I was glad to see this new release and happy to find a used copy available (so I didn't have to pay the price of an import!). I wasn't sure what to expect since her first album had so many covers, and this seemed to be all original music, but it quickly became a welcome addition to my music collection. I like to put Something Is Expected on during the first hour of work, when I'm just starting up, or during my lunch hour when I'm looking for some nice background music while I eat and read. If you haven't heard her before, give her a try. Her voice is superb (and she *should* have won Canadian Idol)."
4,A Twinkie with a Halo Storm In It,"An exhilirating, merciless, death defying leap of rock'n'roll derring-do which, for all of the album's shrieks and groans, somehow refines that slab of crude, turgid gold that was Locust Abortion Technician. On Hairway to Steven, the Buttholes have revealed their whole bag of dirty tricks - tortured guitarwork, lyrical acrobatics, psychobilly call-and-response, mangled sound compressors - in all their stupendous glory. This delicious, undigested smorgasboard of musical mayhem features many spooky and majestic bits, but for me the part that puts the spice in the chicken is the gently winding melody of the second half to 'Jimi,' where the dwarves whisper to chanting birds, a cock crows languidly, and bowling pins crash to the meter of a gently ebbing tide. HTS is an album well worth a Cadillac drive through the desert southwest on a bellyful of mescal, volume cranked to the big swirling sky, as you hallucinate ten-foot tall Johnny on the dashboard."
5,you rang?,"This is the very first Butthole Surfers album I ever purchased. The first track ""Jimi"" scared the crap out of me, but I was strangely drawn to it like people to the scene of an accident.My fear gave way to sick delight the more I heard it. I relished other tracks such as ""Jonny Smoke"" and ""I saw an xray..."". This became the tape I wore out the quickest. (CD's were still very expensive back then)This album is a masterpiece in the Butt's discography. The twisted humor of the songs is the very essence of the band. Do yourself a huge favor and buy it!"
5,Their last great album,"This is the last great Butthole Surfers album and in my opinion, one of their best ever. It broke my heart to see this compared to the bland, uninspired work that would come later in their career. This album may not have the same kind of hypnotising insanity of their earlier work, (at least not as much of it) but it is almost as enjoyable. If you are new to the Butthole Surfers, i would recommend that you buy this one first. It is just strange enough to keep you interested and just accessable enough not to scare the living crap out of you."
1,the big Hell-No for this one!,"I am in total disagreemant with those who give this album a high rating. I HATE it.There is only one ok song on it, John E. Smokes, but you can find a waay better version of that song, with more extreme vocal acrobatics, on track 10 of 'The Hole Truth...and Nothing Butt' album. Get that one instead, if you don't already have it.Steer clear of this one. Get any of their other albums except this one -there is nothing on it. Don't waste your time on it (this what I wish someone would've told me before I wasted my time on it)."
2,Must only be good when you frying!,"I love the Butthole surfers but this one didn't do it for me. Too spacy just to be spacy, it doesn't make me go oh ya that's some cool music. Independent worm saloon and Electric Larry Land are fantastic albums and one or two that i can't think of now. But this one is a thumbs down from me."
5,BEST GIFT EVER,"My boss at work loves hunting in Maine and he's got all kinds of stuff like this on his truck already (raccoon tail on the antenae, stickers, etc). We bought this off amazon and snuck it on his truck and literally he has not stopped talking about it since we put it on. Even his wife loves it. This is THE best gift to give a hunter."
3,Recipient was underwhelmed but I thought it was hilarious.,The only reason I am giving this 3 instead of 5 stars is because I misjudged its appropriateness for the b'day boy. It arrived quickly and as I expected. I personally think it's a 5 star product.
5,Dorland's Orthopedic Medical Word Book,I'm a medical transcriptionist and use this book for my job. This book arrived on time and was in excellent condition. I always purchase my books on Amazon and am very satisfied every time.
4,Rene Gonzalez is truley talented,"This Cd is wonderful, and his follow-up CD's just keep getting better and better. Rene is also a wonderful teacher and preacher and this comes through in his music. Reconoced has powerfully uplifting lyrics and beautiful music That only his voice can do justice to.This CD is definately a blessing..especially Quiero Adorar, which has become a popular worship song in churches."
4,A voice that sounds like it's been there and back,I like Lacy because she sounds like she's lived the heartbreak lyrics instead of just singing them. Crazy Blue Eyes and 16th Avenue are simply great songs beautifully sung. I'd just like to hear her voice without the gloppy string arrangements she too often used.
5,great memories,This cd brings back great memories with my mother. As a kid i went with her to the movies to see the Nelson & Macdonald films. I was wow'd. This collection of music takes me back to that gentle time. Kuddos! I urge anyone don't hesitate to buy the cd. Best buy for the money.
5,"Yup, it's not the one in the picture.","Though it's not the exact toy OR video that's pictured, it's still a great value. The toy is bright, durable and very easy for my 2-year-old to operate herself,(not like our old talking Lala where she couldn't squeeze the tummy hard enough)and she loves the video. I DID find the exact toy and video when we went to the Toys R Us store, but only at full price. If your little Teletubbies fan is anything like mine, he or she will enjoy these talking toys and whatever video they come with!"
5,Thank you teletubbies!,"Well my son is hooked on teletubbies. He is 18 months and is obsessed. I bought all 4 and they all come with different videos then pictured, no big deal! My son actually favors the shorter 30 minute videos to the 1 hour longer ones. He now has all the movies lucky for me ha! I had gotten the smaller set of them on clearance at target about 6 months back for $.50 a piece what a deal! I had no idea at that time he would love them so much. He takes all the Teletubbies and lines them up on the couch when I put a tape in and sits with them in awe. He can only say 20 words (4 of which are dipsy, lala, po, and tinky). They are lifesaver especially when I am making supper and need him to be distracted for a few minutes!"
4,My 2 year old loves her Teletubbies,"I ordered these for my 2 yr old daughter. First of all the price is excellent for the Teletubby which includes the vhs movie. When they arrived in the mail, her face just lit up and she just went nuts over them. They really don't do anything and they say a few little phrases but to a 2 yr old that's all they need. She takes them everywhere we go even to Grandmas for sleepovers. Overall I am very happy with the purchase. And would recommend them to others."
4,talking po,"this plush toy is very duraBle and you can hear the phrases really well, there is no educational value, the toddler enjoys it very much. if your child is into the teletubbies, they will certainly enjoy this."
4,Good Price for this toy,This was purchased for a child in Holland. This child each year requests one from us. The price and quality was very good.
4,Good introduction,"While this is an informative look at coaching the shotgun triple option, there is a difficult parallel to using the book outside the realm of the author. While there is a good philosophy, I found this book best used in conjunction with videos and other resources in creating an offensive philosphy that has now won back to back state championships."
1,"Very light, easily tipped","My little kitten was able to push this ""X-super heavy"" bowl across the kitchen, tip it over, and spill out all the water as soon as we put it down."
5,A Treasure of a book,"If you hold this book in your hand, smell the print, feel the weight, you already know it must be special. I have collected all of these Volumes and must say they are pieces of art. Unfortunately some are no longer available and they are hard to find - for example my favourite Vol: 3If you have any interest in Colorado, Mining, Narrow Gauge Steam Railroading or abandoned sites and railroads these books are a must have. The quality is high, and the balance between photos and text is just right.Contrary to one of the other reviews I have not had the plastic bonding in my cupboard, although they are stored in the living room in dry conditions.In the worst case the plastic cover could be removed, it is see through plastic so no information is getting lost."
2,"Krups FEM2B 2-Slice Toaster, Black and Silver",THis toaster has been a dissapointment to me being that it was highly revieved on Consumer Report Online. It burns the bread along the very top of the slice.I was wondering if this was a used toaster that had been fixed with old parts? I had an item sold to me like this thru another company and had been given no warning of such until I unpacked the box.In any case the Krups toaster was not what I expected.
2,A toaster with ups and downs syndrome.,"It took a little while to get the feel of the two-sided handle. It not only starts the toasting cycle, but raises the toast higher for removal.Thus, it's great at retrieving any size piece of toast. However, the overall unevenness of toasting, gives this only 2 stars."
2,feeble toasting power,"All right, it's kind of cute, but -- no matter how dark the setting, I have to toast the bread at least twice to get it to brown. I am amazed that despite glowing consumer ratings at several sites, this toaster's performance is no better than the cheaper toaster it replaced. I conclude that it is impossible to find a good toaster for under $100."
2,"Lots of features, but doesn't toast evenly","This toaster looks good and has lots of special features, but doesn't perform its main purpose, which is toasting bread and bagels. I tried toasting both with the same result: they were very brown at the top and not toasted at all on the bottom. Also, this toaster leaves large stripes on the bread that aren't toasted. I sent it back the day after I received it and purchased the Cuisinart Metal Classic Toaster, which is even better looking and toasts very evenly, top to bottom, with no stripes."
4,"Good little toaster, especially for bagels","I had a tfal toaster that died, and needed a replacement. This toaster does the job well. I haven't had any problems with uneven toasting that have been reported in other reviews, and I like the fact that it has nice deep slots (for rye bread) and that the slots are wide enough for bagels.The pull-out crumb tray is also convenient. I also like the easy to use lever to raise the toast out of the slots. I do wish that the 'cancel' button was easier to see and that the bagel and defrost buttons lit up to indicate that you have pressed them. But hey, its just a toaster, and its just making toast."
3,Nice toaster but could be better,"We got this toaster as a wedding gift from our wedding registry and it's nice looking with lots of options. The only problems are that the toaster slots are a little small and don't fit all types of bread. Also, depending on the size and thickness of the bread the toaster doesn't always toast evenly, leaving some corners untoasted. Overall it's fine but you can find something better."
2,"Flashy outside, lousy inside","I bought this unit as I was looking for a quality unit (Krup had a good name, notice past tense); this toaster didn't last a year. Even from the outset, it did not toast very evenly. I will probably never buy another Krup product as it wasn't cheap and it didn't last (Is it quality control, lousy technology or what that produces these poor quality products?)."
2,Doesn't toast evenly top to bottom,We've had this unit for several years. I wish I had returned it. It looks great and I like the lever to raise the toast out of the unit. But I almost always have to rotate the toast to get it toasted on the bottom.
3,Had to settle for used.,"I saw this toaster over a year ago, and finally broke down and purchased one. Love the design and ease of use. Nice wide slots, and easy to ""pre-pop"" whatever is being toasted. Does great with bread, bagels, and English muffins. Only problem is, I was shipped a used one, which I had to settle for ... vendor problem, not a product problem."
1,Lousy,"Have had this thing for about a year and I give up. Unless you slice your bread an inch and a half thick, it burns the slice on the edges and dries it out in the middle."
3,"Close, but no perfect toast.","As many others have stated, this toaster does not toast evenly nor does is toast consistently. I thought I had struck gold after the first batch of toast came out very well, but as I continued to use the toaster each consecutive batch had me guessing at which setting I should choose.I love the lift which makes removing smaller pieces of bread easy, and the rest of the features are very nice. However, as another reviewer said, it strikes out at toasting.My never ending quest for the perfect toaster continues.Next up, the Oster Counterforms 6335."
4,Looks great in our kitchen and does a good job!,"I bought this toaster in exchange for an inexpensive $10 toaster because this old one was too narrow to fit bagles or rolls. This toaster does exactly what it should do...it toasts bread, bagels and rolls, and it does it very well!In addition to it, you will get a great looking device, which looks very nice on your countertops in your kitchen. The black and steel finish looks really stylish and the whole look-and-feel of this toaster is of a very high quality for an unbeatably low price on amazon.com."
4,Performs as advertised,"A pretty good toaster that works as advertised. Once in a while it toasts unevenly, but not sure if that due to the type or shape of the stuff being toasted. Having the same lever load the toast and also extend it for removal is really handy. All in all, a good purchase."
2,Not good enough for the $50 plus price range,"I like the manufacturer, hence went with it but realized it's not the best for the price. The bread comes out quite bent up no matter whether you put it horizontally or vertically. Also after couple uses, I realized I had to keep bumping up the setting to 5 than 6 and the max is 8 which I might hit in the next couple months? and of course will then end up with a terribly burnt up 'toast like object' Though the looks are v.nice and the pop down handle is convenient to use. I wished it had worked out but will be returning it and trying out the 'Breville Ikon Toaster'"
1,Cheap aluminum parts bend,"But it toasts lousy, won't take slices that are the least non-standard in size or shape, and the cheap aluminum parts inside bend and jam. If you are looking for the Holy Grail of German toasts, look elsewhere; this one is made in China."
5,Best Toaster I have ever Owned,"My sons gave this toaster to me. They did a great job picking one out. The bagel settings are great(slots nice and wide too), love the defrost mode, great to hit with frozen items like waffles, then toast them, they come out perfect. The feature I like best is that you can make smaller items like english muffins pop up higher so that you don't have to use the ""fork method"". Another great feature is the drawer that slides out sooo easily to clean out the crumbs. With my old toasters I had to turn them upside down, unscrew the tray and shake the toaster to get crumbs out and what a mess! It's so easy to wipe down with wet cloth and always looks clean, goes great with other Stainless appliances too."
3,Looks great--works okay,"I saw various reviews about the toasting consistency of this product. I thought people were getting very picky. I was wrong. It is very inconsistent. We have the toast set to 6, which is beyond average, and sometimes we get visible ""toasting"" and sometimes, the bread just looks stale. The bagel setting works great for fresh bagels, toasting only the cut side while warming the remaining parts. I like that the bread stays in the warm toaster until you pop it up. We'll live with it for now, but won't purchase it as a gift or recommend it to others."
2,died too soon,"I did a lot of research and really loved this toaster up until the day it broke!It looks good,toasts all sizes of bread and bagels well.But less than a year from purchase one of the little metal supports for the bread bent and ""jumped the track"".I managed to push it back temporarily but I have to replace it."
3,Excellent... Except for Toasting!,"This toaster has a really friendly user interface. However, it won't toast my bread darkly. I would think a german manufacturer would get this right since germans love hard breads.Using a 3/4 inch (1.5 cm) thick slice of sour dough bread, it hardly toasts at all and has no color whatsoever --even at the highest setting. Very frustrating.I'm going to return it."
2,Krups toaster comes up short,"As well as not toasting evenly, the slots of this toaster are too short for the sliced bread I use - opening is just under 5 inches long. I have to cut the crusts off the bread to fit it in the toaster. I do like the toaster's ability to raise shorter items (like muffins) that you would otherwise have to fish out with a fork. Crumb tray is very easy to remove at base of model. Space above toaster gets REALLY hot when it's on the higher settings - not suitable for low undercounter spaces."
3,To short to be really useful,"Krups FEM2B 2-Slice Toaster, Black & SilverThe toaster is well build but the slot for the bread is too short and two narrow to be really useful. The slots are too short for normal bread and too narrow for bagles. It works reasonably well, but I should not have to force bread into the slots. You must use the top tray to toast a bagle. If the slots were an inch longer and half an inch wider, this would be a fine toaster."
1,Krups: Quality Control Issues?,"Hi, I usually don't complain about the products that I buy because I consider myself a savvy consumer, but in this instance I was dubbed big time! A few years ago, we received a Krups coffee maker as a wedding gift and we love it! However, this particular toaster rarely worked. In fact, I would say that 85% time it would either not toast or would ""flip"" the toast prematurely e.g. 5 second or less. I have no idea if this is a fluck in quality control or not, but I highly recommend buying a different toaster. I know, I thought, Krups makes a toaster? Wow, I'll buy it, after all how hard can it be for a German company to manufacture functional a toaster? Well, evidently, they have issues."
1,Not Recommended,"Purchased this Krups toaster in December, at the time it was $59.99, and yesterday it decided to retire itself from the toasting business.Eight months for a supposedly high end toaster, with a new sleek design. No returns over 30 days."
1,broken after 3 days!,I researched the best rated toasters and came up with this one. It worked fine for two days and made good toast. The metal parts that hold the bread are so flimsy that they actually bent and jammed the unit. Amazon was great about accepting the return without the packaging.
1,Not a good infuser,"I ordered this infuser because I constantly order loose leaf tea and wanted something more ""stylish"" looking to use as an infuser. The holes are way too big, and most of the tea leaves end up floating in my cup. Also, the infuser floats in my cup, so I constantly have to hold it down. If I could get my money back, I would."
2,Stylish- but not functional,"I bought this tea infuser as a gift and it had the eye appeal but that's about it. Very hard to untwist to put tea in. Once the tea is in, the holes are too big and unless you are using large leaf tea, much of it will end up in your cup. The plastic was also cheap. As I was trying to unscrew the metal tip to remove my used leaves, the handle broke right off!I would not suggest buying this product. :("
4,"Good, but could be improved","Others have mentioned the flaws in this product. For me, it was easy to improve the product by drilling four small (1/16th inch) holes in the upper plastic part of the tea cavity: this allows air to bubble out of the infuser when it is first immersed in water. Without these holes, the infuser traps air and -- to be Biblical -- my cup runneth over. With the holes, this product works perfectly."
4,TeaTime.,"We love to drink tea and we prefer to drink loose tea. We used to buy empty tea bags but it seemed a bit wasteful. After getting this we can brew a cup of tea very easily. It just opens you fill it up and put it in a cup and fill it with water :) It gets the job done.We dont use the stand it just lays somewhere.However, i do kinda dislike that it is made of plastic.wish it was metal."
2,Nice Aethetics poorly designed product,"Being a product designer I was really attracted to the look of the Tovolo tea infuser. Unfortunately the holes are made way too small and the water has a very hard time infusing with the tea leaves. This product basically doesn't work! The designer should have paid more attention to the most important detail, function! It was $10 poorly spent, don't waste your time."
1,"looks good, functions poorly","This product looks really cool but it functions poorly. You fill the bottom infuser part with the tea. As you quickly find out when you try to use this product to brew tea the top portion is filled too...with air. The air makes the infuser want to bounce along the top of the cup so you are forced to hold it down into the cup and stir it like a spoon to get the infusing going.While some people have complained of the holes being too small, I found them to be too large. A lot of tea leaf matter ends up floating around the cup.I have some infusers made with fine wire mesh. There is no problem with air creating flotation with those, and no leaf pieces end up in my tea. I will go back to using those and consider this ten bucks wasted."
5,New way to enjoy tea!,"This totally changed the way I enjoy loose leaf tea!No more rusty infuser! The sleek design, the bright green and the ease of use makes it a great gadget to have.And no more mess, after you finish infusing just rest the infuser in its base."
3,OK,"Not great, but better than the one I had. Quite a bit of the loose tea makes it's way out of the holes and into my cup. I will be looking for another option for my loose tea."
2,"I wanted to love it, but...","I saw this tea infuser in a tea shop while on vacation and decided that I needed to have it. I am glad I waited! When I returned home from vacation I visited a friend to help her paint and she offered me a cup of tea with this exact tea infuser. I really loved the color and shape, but I felt like I left half of my cup of tea undrunk due to the magnitude of tea leaves floating in the bottom of my cup. When I infuse tea, I want to drink the tea, not the leaves. I did like the ability to easily stir the cup of tea and the holder, but the holes in the infuser are HUGE. I think I will pass on this one and stick with my Finium fine mesh tea infuser until I find something that actually strains the leaves."
4,Nifty and a half,"Is it better than a normal infuser? Not really. It depends on what type of mug you use or where you are going to be using it. I use it at work. It makes clean up easier and starts conversations. I'm a bit worried about how long it will last but it was pretty cheap, I won't be disappointed."
3,Can we say watered-down Cosmo?,"With Cosmopolitan Girls as a title, I was expecting for this book to be as racy, saucy, and provocative as the drink it's named after. What I got was watered-down. It was very predictable to say the least. The only reason I gave it 3 stars was because some parts were fun to read...but overall, I'd say you can pass on this one."
3,Pretty Good Read,I thought this book was pretty good. It wasn't the best book I have ever read but it was enjoyable. Sometimes it's nice to read about other crazy women so that you feel like your life isn't that bad! Haha!
4,"Fun, easy read","Enjoyable summer read. Story is interesting and goes quickly so perfect book for a plane trip or vacation. This book is not for someone who is looking for an incredibly deep read, but if you are interested in something light and fun you will be satisfied."
4,Girl Power,"Cosmopolitan Girls is all about girl power. The story of Charlie and Lindsay unfold separately chapter by chapter and then they meet in a trendy Hew York bar and become friends. They bond over issues in their relationships, their careers, and their own complete happiness. From that point on they are inseparable and go through high times and low times, never failing to be there for each other, like true girlfriends.Reviewed by AieshaOf the Detroit-RAWSISTAZ"
3,"Quick, Easy and Entertaining!","This book was an easy, quick read! I especially liked the ""Cosmopolitan Girls"" Advice at the end of the book. If you're looking for a book that's entertaining and fun, then this is the book for you."
1,Don't let yourselves be fooled by this one !,"I've had this cd since 1997, specially dedicated by Robbie himself. I actually got this ""special edition"" because I really like most of the things he has done, but in fact, I never listen to Vintage. Why ?Well, this is a sort of demo tape. The recordings are from 1983, except track 5, which is from 1974, and all were preserved on acetate. For some reason, Robbie decided to release this on cd. Actually, the first four tracks merely exceed 3 minutes, and are not a big thrill. ""She loves my car"" can also be found on Bobby Caldwell's worst album (August moon). Overall, it is only worth it if you are more than a fanatic of Robbie Dupree.Considering the price asked for this, my advise is that you invest your money in other albums from Robbie Dupree : the self-titled one, Walking on water, Smoke and mirrors, or Street corner Heroes. The first three exist in cd. I have them ... and they are five stars, trust me !"
4,memories revisited,"Boone was always a great way of getting family together. I think that is why I still enjoy watching. Season 3 has been just as good as seasons 1&2.I think that anyone who plans to watch more of series should keep an open mind when reading future reviews.As I have learned by watching lots of other series,some of the actors will come & go,what is important is how the rest of the show handles it.The waltons was ruined with the loss of Richard Thomas and others.So far Danll has held his own."
3,Worthwhile wankery,"3 1/2Though eighties production can sometimes take a good chunk of vibrancy away from these adventurous jazz-fusion recordings, Meola never sounds dull and often triumphs with shimmering solos over sour sonics."
2,Rolling Di Meola in Dullness and Powdered Sugar,"You might want to skip this review if you appreciate Phil Collins's drumming and the Frankie Goes to Hollywood sound of the Fairlight CMI. Both drive me crazy, perhaps the former more than the latter. Whatever the case, Di Meola's a gifted, highly expressive, innovative guitarist when playing on albums alone or with musicians of his own caliber. Here Collins's typical thud-thud-thudding detracts from everything on the lower register and the Fairlight sprinkles the middle and upper ranges with powdered sugar. Innovative people make mistakes, of course, but the mistakes are not necessarily worth owning. ""Elegant Gypsy,"" ""Friday Night In San Francisco,"" ""Trio"" and ""Casino"" are among the truer testimonies to Di Meola's gifts."
4,Great product - but no replacement parts are available,"This Krups citrus juicer is compact, powerful and useful. It is wonderful for fresh lemon and lime juice for spectacular fresh margaritas, as well as the usual orange and grapefruit juice. It is easy to clean, but also easy for a new user to accidentally discard the juicer cone into the trash bin when emptying the pulp tray. This is especially true of the black version, you may not notice that you have dumped the black cone in the trash. No replacement part is available, either online or from Krups. I had to buy another machine (a white one!) for the part. If the part ever becomes available, I'll have a citrus press gift for someone. I'll give it with the recipe below!Fresh maragaritas1 part fresh lemon and lime juice macerated overnight with 1/4 part sugar and grated zest1 part tequila, blue agave, reposada1 part triple sec1 part crushed iceShaken and poured over another 1 part crushed ice in a salted glass"
4,Great Machine!,Does a fine job of juicing lemons and oranges. A good substitute for the discontinued Braun model.
2,Not Enough Bang For Your Buck,"This juicer works well for oranges and smaller citrus, but if you like grapefruit juice look somewhere else. The power of the motor is lacking and the auto-reverse feature is spasmodic and not effective. On the upside, the spout feature is well designed and the pulp option is also pretty slick. But overall for the price (~$50) I expected more bang for my buck."
3,carving fork doesn't fit,The carving fork is too fat to fit into any of the slots on this knife block. You apparently have to get the larger block for it.
4,"Functional Shun block, no space for cleaver","This functional bamboo shun block is a good storage solution for my Shun knives and gets them out of the drawer and will prevent them from damage, however the block doesn't provide space for the Shun cleaver."
