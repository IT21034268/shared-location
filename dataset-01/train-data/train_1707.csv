5,Coming up to speed!,Here is your opportunity to review or comprehend all the math youneed to understand modern physics. Make no mistake - you will also learn new things you have always wanted to know about the mathematics behind the new and exciting theories of the leading quantum physicists. I recommend this book to armchair and professional scientists in all fields!
1,Not as advertised,"I re-learned calculus for this book (and others), but 90% of the math - and the book is all math - is much more advanced than calculus.I believe the book would be very valuable to someone with an advanced degree in math, recent enough to still retain the details, and who has no prior background in physics, but who is interested in it. Penrose cannot or does not have the ability to 'teach' the math, either - he calls some functions ""uncomfortable"" or a function ""doesn't seem honest"", etc shop-talk for people who know this stuff inside/out already. But if you're an advanced mathematician, this is the introductory physics text for you."
4,Warning: Higher Math Required,"Roger Penrose is a mathematical physicist, and it is no surprise that this ""Guide to the Laws of the Universe"" is full of higher math. In fact the first 16 chapters (out of 34) are a course in the mathematical tools required to understand the rest. Even though he claims you could skip the equations and just read the words, I disagree - you would undertstand less than 10% of it. I'm at Chapter 8 (""Riemann Surfaces and Complex Mappings"") and I comprehend about 50% (I'm a retired physicist!). But I enjoy stretching my mind and I'm sure that I'll return to review these concepts once I get to the physics meat of the book.Note - there is a Web page that lists all the typos and other errors in the first edition, and also promises to give solutions to all the exercises later this year."
4,Don't be Intimidated by the Math,"If you have a college degree in a hard science discipline, most of the math Penrose needs you to grasp should not be foreign to you. I only found the chapters on Relativity lacking. This is surprising as Penrose is one of the contemporary authorities on this subject. Perhaps, as a reader of this book would do as well, Penrose gets more excitement pondering things that are a little exotic. Along the way you might get some new ideas of your own, too! Luckily there are excellent and free introductions to tensor calculus and Relativity on the Web if you need them.If you are, or have been interested in math beyond high school, and feel that you could do better than watch a PBS special on modern Physics, then THIS IS IT! I wish I had this book when I graduated from high school."
2,Know Your Math!!!!,"As an occasional reader of some of the more general books on the universe, I was looking for something with a little more detail, something that didn't run away from math. A quick read of the intro and I thought this would be the perfect book. Penrose claimed that he could help people with limited ability to work with fractions. Fractions?!? No problem I thought.A few pages later and I was drowning. This isn't simple math. Problem is, he doesn't start from the beginning and build up (which granted would take more like 10,000 pages). Instead, this book jumps hardcore into some serious math. I'm sure this is great for some people and many will deservedly give this book 5 stars. My issue is that it is being sold as a ""don't worry, I'll teach you what you need to know"" type of book. In reality, the reader better have a serious math background. For the record, my math background was generally statistics and business related math via an undergrad and an MBA program."
4,Requires a PhD in Math or Physics,"This is an extremely thorough book, but it goes through an entire undergraduate course in math in about two hundred pages. It requires a lot of background to read. If you do the problems, the book is easily a year long course in grad school. The casual reader had best have a PhD in physics or math. However, for me, the book explains a lot of the mysteries of modern physics in trying to unify quantum physics with general relativity."
3,A flowery mess,"This self-indulgent mess of a book manages to be both pedantic & obscure. The author seems more interested in impressing his breath of knowledge on the reader than in imparting understanding. The book oscillates between obvious simplicities and nuanced complexities with the speed of a neutrino. Penrose uses arcane and, in some cases, idiosyncratic notations to drive home points which are unintelligible unless the reader takes a long detour to learn them.This book requires a graduate level of math literacy and a willingness to do the hard work of trying to figure out what the author is talking about. This work can pay off in greater insight & new understanding. It can also lead to frustration, so beware.I am glad the author wrote this challenging book, but would enjoy throwing a pie in his face to teach him not to first patronize then humiliate his readers. Of course I would never do that, because on TV at least, he seems to be a lovable person."
3,Comprehensive but too hard to read,"The author seems very knowledgeable and has worked really hard for the book. However, the book is pretty much useless even for a college educated individual with average math knowledge. The author keeps repeating that he will try to keep math to minimum and use it only when he cannot avoid it. But 80% of this more than 1000 pages book is math, advanced and difficult math. Average reader would be better off reading a less technical book on the subject."
3,Not for the Casual Observer,"This book would have earned 5 stars if I had the proper background. I was able to skim through 1/3 of the book and was able to absorb 1/30th of what I read. This is obviously a beautiful & learned dissertation on the fundamental laws of the physical world and the mathematics that define the laws. But unless you have a PHD in physics and math, forget it! This is not casual reading!Perhaps my only useful comment would be that his math expeditions should have been an appendix, not the introduction to this massive book."
2,Review only,"Alas I must give thumbs down to this book. If you know the material then it can be a useful roadmap with some interesting highlights, but when he gets into an area you don't already know the book has little value. He doesn't explain the math, so it come across as a list of facts. Does a list of facts about tensors really sound useful? Compare this to the brilliant job Kolmogorov and others did in ""Mathematics"".Mathematics: Its Content, Methods and MeaningBuy that instead."
2,Overhyped book - bit of a disappointment,"This book is overhyped and was a disappointment to me. The book consists of 2 parts : the first part summarizes the mathematical background that you need for the second part. But the chapters are not explained in such a way that they can serve as stand-alone study material; so if you lack some knowledge, the book itself will not be sufficient to explain everything and help you through the second part.Penrose tries to explain complex mathematical concepts without formula, which turns out to be a failure. I stopped reading the book at about 70% and sold it on eBay, I didn't even want to keep it in my personal library! I wouldn't especially recommend this book."
4,As Advertised: Hard,"Only got through 1 and 1/2 chapters so far; the author tries to teach you the math he plans to use. He encourages skimming, but that's just not my style. This is the real deal. He'll take you past Hawkins, if you can stick with him."
3,"XM radio good for car and home, not so much as a mobile device","Nice radio for use in the car and home, not so useful for mobile use as the antenna/headset combination is large and a little uncomfortable to wear. Also the battery life is extremely short when using the headset/antenna combination. Also the FM transmitter is not as powerful as in earlier XM radio models so could not use it to wirelessly connect to the car radio as I had in the past. Need to have cradle installed and radio physically connect to the antenna input of the car radio. This required extra expense for labor and parts that did not come with the car adapter kit."
2,"Not the best,",have had problems with this unit locking upgets frustrating since you have a paid subscription you can not useand satellite radio is getting really expensive so you do want a unit that keeps on working so you can get what you pay for!!
2,Both units stopped working,"My first unit stopped working after 8 months. (There was no sound coming from unit) XM customer service agreed to replace the model at no charge. 6 months later the second unit stopped working...same problem, no sound. XM will not offer me another replacement. XM's replacement offer for the portable model is the Pioneer with a cost of $200!! Do not buy this product if you plan on using it for more than a year"
2,Skyfi3,I have to resent the radio often and the off button doesn't work half the time. I would not buy this product again.
1,junk!!,"purchased a skyfi3 last year. after a few months it stopped working. sent it back and they gave me a refurbed one. a bigger piece of junk. keeps saying "" no signal"". did everything the tech at delphi told told me to do and still doing the same thing. i would look at another brand of radio first"
1,What? Only to one radio!,It seems this set-up only works to one radio...older systems seem to transmit to any radio in your house??? Amazon was great and it arrived in only 3 days!!!
1,Not Up To Snuff,"I had no problems with the order or shipping thru Amazon and for a few days, this unit worked well. But after a week or two I received the ""check cradle"" message and the unit would no longer charge even though the radio works well in the car charger."
1,Be Careful,"While the Skyfi3 is a very capable and useful XM receiver, this home kit may have an issue that causes the Skyfi3 to fail. It has occurred twice to me but unfortunately I did not see the possible connection until this second failure and more than 30 days after purchase. Amazon is not the place to purchase this from specifically because of the short warranty period."
1,Poor quality- big rip off,"This is the worst radio I have ever owned; the original SkyFi was a much superior product. This one will freeze up when you start the car and then won't turn off should you try to ""re-boot"" it. The tuning buttons on the car cradle are hard to see and operate. The remote control is small and buttons can't be seen in the dark. The mounting kit required the satellite antenna and a separate wire that terminated at the car antenna. There was no better reception resulting from the additional antenna wire."
1,The Worst,"I had a previous model skyfi stolen from my car and replaced it with this ""upgraded"" model. I am totally dissatisfied with this piece of junk.In populated areas the static is intense rendering the radio useless. It is not user friendly and from time to time it locks up."
2,Altec Lansing XM3120 is another option,"Amazon sells the Altec Lansing XM3120 for 16.95.This unit works with skyfi3 (use the included Roady XT adapter).Apparently, the volume adjustment knob on the XM3120 will NOT work with the SKYFi3. To adjust volume, use the volume controls on the side of the SKYFi3, or the SKYFi3's remote control.New comment: I just received the Altec Lansing unit, and its volume knob WORKS. To change the volume you can use this knob, or the skifi3 remote control (or the radio volume).The Roady XT home kit ($15) may also work with Skyfi3 radios; I am not going to order this kit because I like the Altec Lansing unit much better than any home kit."
4,Great SciFi adventure,"This remains a strong favorite of mine. I love the far-flung locations with various cultures, space travel, and fun sci-fi gadgetry - it was a lot of fun to read.And the mystery of what was really going on kept me guessing throughout. I don't like spoilers so I'm not going any further with it, as much as it may kill me. :)I just finished reading book 2 (Warpaint) which was great. Personally I hope you'll read this one first because it sets everything up so well. (To be honest Warpaint probably works as a standalone; I just think you'll get so much more out of it when you see how it all began. And I think the fun in this book shouldn't be missed anyway.)"
4,Great book from a great author,"This novel hooks you from the first page with its vivid writing style. It feels like you've pulled back a curtain and stepped straight into Cady's universe. The plot is mostly well paced and has some good, if predictable twists (but maybe I've just been reading the genre too long?) All in all this is a good little read and I can't wait to sink my teeth into the upcoming Cadence Drake novels."
5,Curiosity's Reward,"Holly designs and offers fiction writing courses and sells these courses to aspiring writers. Her elevator pitch is, ""I write and you can too."" I read the book to test her metal and found her claim of excellence to be true. Her vision of space travel is both plausible and interesting and her prose paints you are here picture in each setting. Every page is filled with excitement and suspense, urging me to reed faster. The surprise at the end was both flabbergasting and rewarding,"
2,"Bad, bad, bad","I love foreign action films. I take chances on films I dont know about in the hopes I find a hidden diamond. This one turned out to be just coal. Artwork looks pretty, with the tag line ""From the studio who brought you Ong Bak and blah blah blah""...This movie was not like any of those 3 stated in the tag. Acting was bad. Characters were stiff while delivering lines, overacting while shooting (recoil of weapons), and like the previous reviewer you never know who is who until an hour in which adds to the poor character development.That aside, the action scenes are ok, not great. Modern day ninjas (with machine guns) drop after a kick. Book beats gun every time. Didn't know grabbing a fire extinguisher could go unnoticed but alas I guess its possible.Movie was overall dark, lighting seemingly coming out of nowhere in the middle of the woods. Logical progressions in storyline are absent.Not worth buying. Rent it, or you can have mine."
3,A CONFUSING YET ACTION-PACKED MESS!!!!!,"This film is a textbook example on how an awesome concept can derail quickly. The movie seems to have an intricate suspenseful plot but instead we get an over-complicated confusing mess that has too many damn characters and not enough substance. When you're a B-Movie, you just can't replicate BOURNE IDENTITY guys!!! Success in these type of films is simplicity and non-stop action. The action sequences are good but at times rely on close-ups, fast-cuts and dark backgrounds which hinder the viewer from enjoying the full action scene. Even with all these shortcomings the movie is ACTION-PACKED with a mish-mash of hot butt-kicking ladies and cool characters. Overall, the movie is worth a rental especially if you're a sucker(like me!)for girls with guns and automatic weapon firing ninjas!!!"
5,Best Tossers Album to Date,"After listening to the mandolin dominated Communication & Conviction, the Last Seven Years; the solid albums Purgatory and the Long Dim Road; and finally The Vally of the Shadow of Death, I can honestly say that this is the best Tossers album to date. The songs are well balanced and they have stayed true to the Irish/Punk roots that make their music work. I especially enjoy A Criminal of Me, The Crock of Gold, and the title track; but that is not to say there are any weak tracks on the album. If you're interested in hearing some Irish punk this would be a good place to start off, or perhaps listen to some of the Pogues, who started it all. If you've listened to some of the other Tossers albums and enjoyed them you'll surely enjoy this one as well. If you like some of the other bands out there like The Pogues, Flogging Molly, the Skels, and Blood or Whiskey, then you'll like these boys from Chicago too."
4,Very Good But They Don't Even Come Close To The Pogues.,This band is what I would call a polished Irish punk band with skilled musicians. The Pogues were like a runaway train ready to derail at any moment but this band is firmly on the tracks which to me takes away from the excitement of the music. They are talented but if I was going for a modern Celtic punk band I would have to go with Flogging Molly. They have a slight feel of hardcore punk edge to them.
1,STU MEAT SAYS,"ok cd, only a couple songs worth listenig to. its too bad becouse this is a good band but a disapointing cd."
5,bestbook:),"This book is honestly one of the best books I have ever read. Sapphire and her brother Conor's father has disapeared without a trace. They attempt to find their father and will not even bring the idea into their heads that he's dead, no matter how much people push it. Sapphire and Conor explore the world of Ingo as they find out they have Mer blood. Could there father be in the UnderWater world of Ingo? Well they are going to find out."
5,Not your everyday mermaid story,"My daughter loves mermaid books and movies. I lean more on the realistic side of life and struggle with the fantasy genre. I decided to read the book first to make sure it was okay for my daughter to read and to find a way to relate to something she enjoys. I was surprised by how much I actually enjoyed the book. It is not your everyday mermaid story, there is a lot more to the characters. I also love the way the author describes the underwater world of Ingo. My daughter is reading it now and we both agree there are days we would love to be ""away in Ingo"". We are also a Christian family and there are a few red flags in this book for me earth magic, mom's boyfriend, Sapphire's behavior)."
1,"Not what I want my kiddos to read. Not my favorite, either.","I don't think my kids need to be exposed to the negative content in the book. For myself, I really enjoyed reading the Harry Potter books and many other kids' books. I never made it all the way through this book. The main character is very unappealing."
5,f in co,"This is a wonderful story that most folks will enjoy. It has a good mix of mystery, fantasy and familiar surroundings. If you enjoy the mix of the ""real"" world and a fantasy world in Harry Potter, you will also enjoy this story. Although not as complex and detailed as Harry Potter, this novel is an entertaining, enjoyable read."
5,Great Book!!!,The plot really makes you want to keep reading until you figure out what Conner and Sapphire are going to do about their problem with the mer in the magical underwater land of Ingo.I was really disappointed in how the book just stops just when you think you are really going to grasp the story of her father. Can't wait till I get hold of a copy of the next book.
1,Svae your time and money,"Unless you own a gigablock burner, don't bother buying gigablock disks. They wont work on your home computer."
2,It lacked visual clarity,"Maybe I was expecting too much when i purchased this book. The concept is good and the wording is very cute, but the colors and vibrancy are definitely visually confusing to a little child ( my younger daughter of 2.5 ) could not clearly see the shape of the the numbers. The felt design print somehow lacks sufficient definition and the page looked to me like it was more chaos than clarity. I am glad I bought a used copy and so did'nt waste much on this."
4,Geography,The books were in excellent condition.This gives the student a good understanding on readingmaps and graphs. The instructions are easy to understand.
4,Voice of American Muslims??,"Khan express the interest of muslims through his works, which details the voice of a modern muslim living in America. However, this book details the ideology of Islam translated into how it is adapted in America. Some of the views change, and some dont."
5,Quality Filter,"This is a high quality filter. It looks sturdy and well made, it comes with the foam wrap that makes it a complete replacement. I am pleased with the price and its quality."
1,"Read the title: ""STUDY GUIDE""","What a useless study guide. All this does is reprint the chapter summary and removes a few words and asks you to fill in the blanks. Do not, repeat, NOT, waste your money on this.What a cheap ripoff by the publisher."
2,Lifeless Review of 60 Lively Years,"This surprisingly short (less than 200 pp) book attempts a vast sweep of coverage and falls short. Its failings extend beyond gaps, however, which are arguably inevitable in a survey of this sort. One might more readily excuse the gaps (such as omitting AIDS and the gay rights movement from the ""Protest and Unrest"" section, or JFK's assassination from the section on the presidency), if it weren't for the redundancy of having both a ""Hollywood"" and an ""Arts & Entertainment"" section, plus ""Fashion, Fads & Fun,"" which cover far too much of the same ground. Worse, even those who expect less substance from Life than I may have hoped to see are likely to be disappointed by the all-important photos. Far too many are presented in awkward two-page spreads which are crossed in the center by the book's binding, ruining much of the photos' effect."
2,limited use,The fact that this is set to only sharpen one angle is not clearly represented in it's presentation for sale. If you decide to buy it make sure your scissors have the correct angle or else it's useless as is the one I bought.
5,Great Product for School Use,"I'm an art teacher, and needless to say my classroom scissors go through a lot of use and abuse! I found that these scissors were dull to the point that they were almost unusable. I found this product on Amazon, and took a chance that it would work.I was pleasantly surprised that this product easily sharpened my classroom scissors to almost new condition. I'll certainly buy another, when/if this one wears out."
2,Scissor Sharpener,This product will only work on small stuff. If you've got normal sized scissors get another product.
3,Scissor sharpener good for most scissors,"This sharpener easily and very quickly sharpened all my paper and cloth cutting scissers.However, for my thicker kitchen scissors, it really didn't sharpen them much.I would recommend the product though for those wanting to sharpen normal thickness scissors."
2,Incorrect information reflects the shortcut route it takes,"Although the spirit of trying to be a handy reference is not a bad one, the books cannot differentiate itself from many of the short-cut, shallow books out there. One particular, when talking about Apache and mod_perl, a very important and prevelant extension to Apache, the author wrongfully states that ""system calls such as system() ... IO pipe do not work."" This is simply wrong in so many aspects. All of these can serve useful purposes when normal amount of caution is taken. THEY WORK. It makes me wonder if the author understands the real interaction of I/O under Apache/mod_perl's model at all, since he does not give any reference to the truth. On the other hand, the section does not state caveats such as scope and persistence of variable values in any apache/mod_perl setup. This is such an important issue which is the most common errors among mod_perl CGI beginners. There is NO shortcut to the full power of Apache."
3,"Technically savvy, but poorly written","I don't doubt that Kabir knows what he's talking about in this book, but he's far from a great writer. While installing mod_perl, I found myself rereading the same paragraphs trying to figure out what he meant."
4,Great Multiplayer,"This game has great multiplayer games. However, its single player and two player campains are a little boring and very easy. The multiplayer is one of the best I've ever played."
4,Buy this game. Period.,"The date of the production of this review is 19 Aug 2002, which means that i'm up-to-date on newer systems, like the PS2. However, I wanted to buy an N64 from my friend for a few games, and this game was one of them. It's fun for those of you who don't have multitaps or are sick of the multiplayer games on other systems. It's fun to play on single player as well, so if you have your old N64, or are gonna buy one for kicks, and need something entertaining to do after school (and like destroying things and whooping your pals) then I'd recommend this game."
1,this game is the worst game that I have ever played.,"I rented this game from blockbuster and hated it. I played it for about three minutes then turned it off. The graphics are pukey, the controls are pukey, the sound is pukey, and everything around it is pukey. Don't rent it, don't buy it. Thank You."
5,Helpful and concise,"Mass Appeal is a great little book for anyone who wants to understand the Catholic Mass better. It covers the different parts of Mass, from the entrance of the priest to the concluding hymn. The author does a superb job of explaining the various elements of Mass.I liked how it went over all the things inside the church, such as the holy water fonts and the tabernacle.This concise book is very helpful and easy to read. It has definitely enriched my experience at Mass."
4,Loved It - Sort Of,"I found this to be an extremely interesting mini series. It is ""Titanic"" from a different point of view - the struggle between labor and management to build the most advanced ship of its time. Prominant is the issue of Ireland's long-fought battle for Home Rule. I do not have any problem with errors such as at which site the ship was being built. I view this only as poetic license. After all, this is not a documentary. The story lines were well written and acted. My problem lies with the fact that I was drawn into the story and cared about the future of the various characters. After I realized which characters boarded the ship, I was left hanging as to their fate. Regardless, I would not wish to deter anyone from watching this series. The offer to purchase separate episodes version refers to this series as ""Season One."" I certainly hope this is the case as the story begs for more."
4,Good movie,I purchased this DVD based on a friend's suggestion - it is a good movie showing historical data that I haven't seen before. It also brought to light the issues with the labor force and the daily struggles that they endured. Overall a very good movie.
3,Abrupt Ending,"I found this miniseries while flicking through the channels and taped all twelve installments. We enjoyed the first 8 episodes but then the last 4 seemed to drag on with the last episode ending as the Titanic left port. I realize that we all know the fate of the ship, however, there were some survivors - so, it is up to the viewer to make our own assumptions about the main characters aboard. Did any survive? Did Mark realize that the daughter he had been searching for throughout most of the series was on board? Too many loose ends ruined a good series. I was left feeling cheated."
5,Sgt. Frog,"Arrives on time, one of the cheapest I've seen. Nothing is missing from the box, evertything comes new and unopened ready to watch and ejnoy."
5,WOW!,"I've liked the Registrators evevrsence they came out with there first 7"" on Rip-Off Records. Sixteen Wires is one of the greatest records I have ever heard, they have taken what was a great punk band and turned it into one of the greatest rock bands of 2000. If there growwing this fast as a band I'm almost afraid of what going to come next. I also think this was a great move for Rip-off records, a 2 record set, high doller cover art, and a sound thats not regular for this awsome record label!"
4,Well worth the price,"This is the kind of tool you never really think you need, but once you have one you'll wonder why you went to so much trouble measuring your angles before.I do a lot of roof and stair work, and this guy pays for himself every time I use it. Rafter (speed) squares are good, but easy to make a mistake. This is just a matter of slapping your Johnson in place and enjoying the quick reading!Well worth the money even if you only use it a couple of times a year."
4,well worth the price good for motorized dishes,had to buy this from the USA as you can not get them on ebay or amazon.uki do like this angle finder it has a strong magnet to stick to the metal poles to set the azimuth angle to fit motorized dishesthe pointer is easy to read with a smooth action as wellwill drill a hole in it and put a chain on itso i can hook it on my tool beltas in the past if you are fitting a dish you can knock it off the pole sending it to its death 20 foot below youwell worth the moneydoes anyone sell them in the uk please tell me!!!!
4,beware the magnet for film applications,we bought this to use on film shoots and we had to cut off the magnet to not affect the camera.
2,Fragile,"This sat in my trunk for a few months while I was using this to get the pitch on a roof. The gauge broke after about 2 months in my trunk. I understand I wasn't taking premium care of it, but I expected a year out of it."
2,OK for general setting,Quick and dirty unit. Arrived prompty and in good condition. Not highly accurate (for sub 2 degree measuring). If your going to be concerned about accuracy below the 2 degree interval mark then buy a digital angle finder.
3,not for all Lumix,"I ordered this battery the day I ordered my Lumix DMC-ZS3 because it came up on Amazon's site as the battery for that camera. It is not. So, if you have a DMC-ZS3, don't order this!I do agree to always buy the manufacturers battery. For my last camera, I tried one of the knock-offs, and everytime I used that battery my camera would heat up when I took videos. Stay safe, and use the manufacturers!"
1,Frustration Unlimited,"Seller- ACE Photo sent wrong item. After several lengthy telecons with ACE, I returned it under an RMA (I had to pay return shipping), with instructions to send correct item. Instead Ace credited my charge account (an incorrect amount). After several additional telecons, Ace credited my charge card with the balance due me (not including any shipping charges). Then to get the correct item, ACE processed a new order (including another shipping charge) and it presumably is in the mail now. Original order was placed May 3; it's now June 2."
1,Check the battery model number carefully!,"This battery comes up on searches for the Lumix DMC-ZS3 (and probably other models). BE CAREFUL! According to the Panasonic web site, the battery works with these cameras:DMC-FX500DMC-FX55DMC-FX35DMC-FX33DMC-FX30DMC-FS20DMC-FS5DMC-FS3The Lumix DMC-ZS3 battery is different: DMW-BCG10 (note G vs. E)"
5,a must have,"spend some extra money on your investment and get the extra battery. the battery life is great on the camera, I took close to 300 or so before needing to charge the battery, adn the a two hr charge time is great too. Very convientent to have a spare battery to keep the pics rollen along"
3,Panasonic DMW-BCE10 Replacement Li-ion Battery,"These DMW-BCE10 batteries are for Panasonic Lumix Digital Cameras but be careful when you order them. They have 2-3 Letters after the BCE10 and that is very confusing since they all look alike!I had to order 3 times to get the right one. They are all just a little different and rechargers won't work if the size is not correct. It's not like buying a BCE09 or BCE07, or even a AA verses AAA. There are minute differences in dimensional sizes.CAUTION: Be sure you have the correct battery; check the letters after BCE10, they're the key to buying the right size."
1,WRONG BATTERY ADVERTISED BY AMAZON FOR LUMIX ZS1,"THIS IS THE WRONG BATTERY FOR THE LUMIX DCE ZS1, which I just bought on Amazon. It should NOT be offered by Amazon as it does not fit the camera or the charger. i do not know why Amazon has mislead it's customers who trust Amazon for truthful and good customer service. Perhaps it is just an unintentional mistake. I bought 2 of these unusable batteries. Amazon, please remove these from the website for this item before other trusting customers are mislead into purchasing them. I understand that the sub contractor who sells the batteries charges S&H to return them. Amazon does not. I wonder if Amazon has any suggestions to remedy this unfortunate situation."
1,Do not buy this battery for this camera!,The battery I recieved was a DMW-BCE10PP....it does not fit the camera....it's too BIG. Why in earth would amazon put these together is beyond me...now I have to find out how to return it.Amazon is usually so good about this.
1,Battery scam,"I also became a victim of the replacement battery issues, ordered a DMW-BCG10 which did not work in the camera. This was purchased at Batteries Plus, they refused to take it back and did not refund any monies. It seems to me its near impossible to buy a replacement battery and to get the right advice on which one to buy. Why do they change things once the camera has been sold to the unsuspecting public!"
5,Old reliable.,I love these panasonic products - never any issues. I have a small Lumix F3 and needed a spare and this fit the bill. I was supprised to find it so cheap and acually branded... Joe
1,wrong battery,"Battery was offered for Lumix ZS-3 camera on Amazon site but was not the correct one. My fault for ordering it before the camera arrived, but the Z-3 was delayed due to it's popular release. Would not have been cost effective to ship it back, so I'll take the hit on this one. Moral of my story is to look at companion items offered after a purchase with a more critical eye."
1,Misleading product,"I ordered this battery under the impression that it was for a Lumix DMC-SZ3 camera, just released by Panasonic. It DOES NOT work for these type of camera. Theis battery showed up as an accessory for this camera in Amazon.com. Not sure why Amazon.com would place this battery as an option for this camera model. Wasted time and money!"
1,doesn't match,When I bought the DMC-ZS1 this battery was suggestion for extra battery on Amazon. I found out it was wrong and can't use. Why Amazon do that to customer?
1,Wrong Battery,This battery is not compatible with the DMC-FS-15 Lumix camera. Although the camera and battery site state that is. It does note fit into the cmera or the charger and has only connections. The battery that came with the camera has 4 and is labeled as the DMW-BCF10PP.
1,Wrong battery as well,Beware - I ordered this battery thinking it was for the Lumix ZS1 and the one i received is for another Lumix model as well. I received model DMW-BCE10 and I believe my camera requires DMW-BCG10PP. Sent vendor an email asking about return and waiting to hear back still.
1,Panasonic Lumix Battery - NOT!,"WARNING: DO NOT PURCHASE THIS RECOMMENDED BATTERY FOR THE PANASONIC DMC-ZS1 DIGITAL CAMERA! REGARDLESS OF WHAT AMAZON.COM TELLS YOU, IT IS NOT THE CORRECT SIZED BATTERY FOR THIS CAMERA. I HAD A HECK OF A TIME GETTING A REFUND FOR THE BATTERY AND DIDN'T GET REIMBURSED FOR THE S&H (EVEN THOUGH I PAID MORE TO HAVE IT SHIPPED RIGHT AWAY AND IT COST MORE THAN THE ACTUAL BATTERY)!"
1,Jordo,Unfortunately the battery shown in your website was incorrect. Thanks to Ace Photo for crediting my account with a refund. The correct model # is DMW-BCG10. The rating for this incorrect battery is therefore irrelevant.
1,Unhappy with amazon.com,"As a regular (former) Amazon.com customer, I slipped into ""auto"" mode when I purchased my camera for 399.00 along with accessories. Accessories arrived without ""free gifts"" as advertised. Price of camera was $50.00 less on other web sites. I contacted Amazon to check on price match. Tough luck for me.Wrong battery, too!!!!!!!!"
5,Lumix Battery - can't beat an original,"Lots of options on batteries, but how can you beat the original battery that comes with the camera. Just as advertised and the charge lasts for lots of shots. Highly recommended."
4,Very Nice Telecon,"Very Nice Teleconverter. Use w/D-80 and 70-300 Nikon G lens. Nice coupler, very tight and stable. Waiting for the 'no light loss' version.."
2,"Works well, but don't expect alot.","Does what is promised, but details are slightly fuzzy on magnification and chromatic aboration (ie. purple fringing in contrast areas) is a problem too. Good value for the money, but if these problems are an issue for you , you will have to spend more money."
3,"OK, but bad at focusing","I used this teleconverter with my Nikon D300 and Nikon 18-200 f/3.5-5.5 lens and, like others have said before, it needs a lot of light. Others have stated about a 'Purple Haziness' in the image, which I have not experienced, so that might be a problem with the coating on their teleconverter.Also, (I don't know if this is a problem with my type of camera/lens in particular) it has a problem autofocusing. It will go back and forth across the point in which it is focused. I just use manual focus which is fine for still wildlife but not for action."
1,does not focus and meter properly,"I tried this converter with D300 and 70-300VR, autofocus deos not work, which really does not matter that much, but it also does not expose properly - camera does not meter properly with it. Not usefull for this camera and lens combination."
2,fuzzy on multiple setups,"I understood the af would be an issue but it doesn't produce clear pictures. used with d40x with a 70-300, d40x &18-55. no autofocus at all on these pictures fuzzy on tripod. used with d200x and 200-400 af worked fine but fuzzy pictures. used with d2x and 300mm 2.8 on tripod. af worked but pictures still fuzzy. not worth the 15% restock fee and shipping to return it."
2,Cant buy expensive lens,This converter is ok for recreational photography. The extra glass elements reduces the amount of light - making it difficult to shoot dim light photos. If you cannot afford a 5000 dollar lens then this lens might be a better choice. A good choice for amatures and not good for shooting the moon. I used this converter with a 55-200mm lens on a Nikon D40X SLR.
2,cheap and not so good,"Use with caution, you can only use it if you have lots of light and time.But this is also amongst the cheapest you can get"
4,Kenko 2x Teleconverter,I like Kenko. I have their extension rings which are wonderful.This teleconverter is not bad. That is the best I can say about it.
3,we need balance,"I read the book and the subject matter is very well defined. however I do think that we as adults, in our complex worlds tend to view things from the whole to the minute rather than vise-versa. parents are so out off touch with their own reality of loss of life and tend to exude their own feelings upon children. death changes at every level of ages and the older we get the more complicated we make it mentally,physically and spiritually."
1,Brass Caliper review,"This is an inexpensive caliper and regrettably, it shows it. It wobbles and is inaccurate. The markings are stamped on it and the brass plate material has been folded - not machined. It looks good until you start using it. It has a vernier scale but it is not properly aligned, so even when closed, it reads that it is not!But, well, it looks good!I have a plastic caliper at home that is my every-day caliper and I have a good digital one. The plastic one is getting worn and this was to replace it, but the plastic one is more accurate even worn than this one is as new.If you are looking for a good quality caliper, this is not it. Mine now sits in my office where I use it for basic stuff that does not require accuracy, and folks come and play with it and comment on how nice it is. So it DOES get complimented, and it does get used; but for modeling and anything requiring accuracy it is not the thing at all."
4,Worth buying,"Now it is reprinted! This, originally 1994 classical guitar solo album of Andrew York is a must for his fans and recommendable for others. Most of the songs are not too hard for an intermediate guitar player, and though you may think they'll be somewhat plain, some of them are really sparkling. In short, they are beautiful and if you can play them by yourself you can appreciate them further. ...and they're not so hard! :)"
1,Horrible,I dont know if it was the shipping but when it arrived the box was crammed with all the paintballs and quiet a few of them borke in all the bags. The paintballs were oily too and shot poorly and often broke in my gun.
3,Haggard shipping but balls are good.,Im not gonna rate these paint balls down b/c i know they're good but the box it came in looked like it rolled down a f**ken cliff. 2 out of 4 bags had broken paint balls.
3,Use right away in Florida,"These are good paintballs if you use them right away. i have tons of paintballs in my garage. RPS Preimum, Stinger, Evil, Marbleizer, and a few field paint and walmart brand paint. After sitting in my Garage for one week thes balls went to crap. Maybe it was my batch, but they were all soft and warped. The cheap field paint and walmart paint held better than these. Now out of the box they work great in a regular hopper and a Qloader, but do not use these in a TPX mag. They deform and jam, but all in all they are ok, just be sure to shoot the whole case when you open it if you live in a climate like i do here in Tampa Florida."
2,Weak story,"The first chapter is a weak and too fast written story.There are better books than this one.As a lot of this kind of books, just written for making money."
2,of moderate interest,"I WANTED TO LIKE THIS BOOK...but it was rambling and very poorly edited. The people who want to convince others that these concepts are true are going to have to do better! Moments of interest... but,overall, disappointing."
3,Parts missing,Was disappointed in this product because some of the parts were missing. I bought it to put on top of my daughter's birthday cake cause she wanted a swamp people theme. I would have returned it if it weren't so close to her birthday.
1,Almost Good,"This is a very cute looking toy, but a couple of problems severely limit its playability.The people will not sit in the boat. They fall over.The tools and oars are so hard to put in the toy people's hands that it requires adult strength to play with them."
1,Not Good,"Kraftwerk has done some wonderful music - Key word ""has"". The music on this CD is awful. I cannot believe how they took one song and played it over and over again with maybe a one bar change - evidently they didn't have enough material or creative juices flowing to introduce new songs. It seems as if they hastily made the CD to re-enter the music market and profit from loyal fans - of which I was one. Purchasing this was a complete waste of money. Sometimes it's better to leave well enough alone - PLEASE Kraftwerk - NO MORE!"
2,I guess they really ran out of money this time,Nobody listens to Kraftwerk because they just want to listen to some techno: we listen to it because we want to listen to some sacred tunes devised by the one and only. This album is a huge disappointment. You don't wait 17 years to listen to something that is a weak derivative of what's already out there!I think it is high time we get a proper album.Who wants to buy a BMW only to find out that the inside and the engine is a KIA!
3,Beware - this is NOT a real CD.,"I bought this ""CD"" in excitement, not having seen a new Kraftwerk release for years. Popped into the car on the way home, and found it drove the player berserk.Closer examination reveals that this is one of those stupid copy protected ""CDs.""A bit of research with google shows that it is in fact possible to make this play, but I just tossed it back to the shop and got my money back."
2,2 stars maybe,"Classic Kraftwerk. And as a reviewer states, is repetitive. I don't know that Kraftwerk captures the Tour de Frances' intensity. If you were looking for a heart pounding hammering beat, this doesn't do it. #12, the last tune is not exactly new, but re-done. If you like Kraftwerk, you'll like this album.An interesting note, I was not able to convert half the tunes to MP3s - I buy CDs for my iPod - what's up with that?! I paid for it, it's mine!Tidbit of information. The other known Tour de France Soundtrack was by John Tesh (when he was the tour's CBS sports commentator with Phil Liggett) not to be confused with a re-release that is nowhere as good as the no longer available limited edition cassette tape. The tape version was so incredibly exciting; so memorable that I had it transferred to CD for safe-keeping... it captured the explosive energy of the bike race. You feel the pain..."
5,Man - Nature - Technology,"The godfathers of Techno, Electro, Hip Hop e.t.c. (did i miss any electronic music genre?)are back with their first album with brandnew material in 17 (!) years, again with an concept album.Of course, you can't seriously expect groundbraking electronic innovations from four guys in their mid-fifties or early-sixties, they've shown that they were innovative enough in the past. But if there is one reason to listen to this latest effort from the KlingKlang studios in Dusseldorf, it is because they brought melodies and elegance back in the dance genre. Maybe in near future, some dance acts will follow this minimalistic master piece, which grows on the listener with every time he is listening ""TDF Soundtracks"". ""The Man Machine"" is back!"
4,A treat,"A lot of people are already calling this album disappointing. I DISAGREE! If you listen to this album with its obvious context in mind (the Tour de France bicycle race), this album successfully captures what the title makes it out to be and what Kraftwerk set out to do. The relationship between man and machine and the gruelling landscape, man's objective, persistence and the land's textures, are all successfully expressed here with Kraftwerk's classic precision and character (and even humour, if you know what I mean). Their music has always had a somewhat transcendant quality to it, it is much more than just background noise for a party. People who appreciate Kraftwerk will understand and enjoy this album, it definitely captures the enduring unique sound of Kraftwerk."
1,Copy-protected and not labelled as such!,"EMI is trying to slip out copy-protected CDs in the US without labelling as such (as they do on European releases). I purchased this and could not put it onto my Ipod (which is NOT illegal). Record companies just don't get it, and will continue to lose out with the consumers."
4,One of the best electronica albums in 2003,"The first 4 or 5 tracks of this CD could easily be one long composition-- a seemless flow of mind-bending electronica. This is what, for me, makes this disk stand out from other Kraftwerk albums: there is a fluidity to most of the songs that generally Kraftwerk only saves for its very best. Or perhaps I like the less 'square' songs in their vocabulary. This is one disk the sits well with me. And given the options in 2003, this stands out as one of the best strict electronica offerings of the year. As much of electronica during this period focused on a more loungey sound, Kraftwerk displays untapped horizons in the more electronic arena."
4,Another Treat from The Unfaltering Robots,"A lot of people are already calling this album disappointing. I DISAGREE! If you listen to this album with its obvious context in mind (the Tour de France bicycle race), this album successfully captures what the title makes it out to be and what Kraftwerk set out to do. The relationship between man and machine and the gruelling landscape, man's objective, persistence and the land's textures, are all successfully expressed here with Kraftwerk's classic precision and character (and even humour, if you know what I mean). Their music has always had a somewhat transcendant quality to it, it is much more than just background noise for a party. People who appreciate Kraftwerk will understand and enjoy this album, it definitely captures the enduring unique sound of Kraftwerk."
5,This CD is BEST played in July...,"When I first heard it, I thought it was quite good, though somewhat repetitive. Then by chance I happened to pop it on while actually watching the Tour on satellite last year (2004). It worked PERFECTLY. To REALLY get a handle on this one, I suggest actually listening to it while watching the tour itself. A PERFECT soundtrack."
5,Tour De France Review,Thanks for sending this item as I was looking for the version from the Breakin 2 soundtrack
2,Icky,"Pretty disappointing for a full album. Nothing different and futuristic as expected, just the same boring sound. The Expo 2000 single was WAY better than this album. There are probably about 2 real good tracks, the rest are pointless."
1,the wait.....,"To think Kraftwerk fans waited almost 20 years for a new full length album. Sad, in more ways than one, considering this is what we got. Mind-numbingly repetitive ( and I say this as a fan of techno music, which is seriously repetitive ) and completely devoid of any memorable melodies. CRAP."
2,Nothing new here folks...,"It's more the type of album I listen to once, take out of player, throw in back seat of my car, and it disappears from existence in my life."
1,very mediochre.,"I started off on a frequent website, when I saw this shameless plug for the band,""study of the lifeless"". I listened, and I tried to give it a chance, I really did. But the sound they were trying to produce, has already been done, and it has been done better. i have one question about the album, they say that there is 2 people in the band, but all that I heard was a man , and a guitar, and a lousy attempt at a drum machine. I was greatly embarrased for this band, Ireally tried to give it a chance, but sometimes you have it and sometimes you dont and this album does not. There is something missing, and something despartly needed."
1,where did my review go?,I seem to be confused. I wrote a very honest review with the idea that it would be printed. I am sad to see that it wasn't. Please explain...
4,This was a spectacular book,"Brett Gerson, a fifteen year old kid who's disrespectful and extremely wealthy. All of this wealth ends when Brett's father is arrested for insider trading. He loses everything from his house all the way down to his five thousand dollar stereo. Now he has to live with his Aunt Mary who loves kissing him on the forehead. He gets a job at a place called Fast Burger, where the boss is what he thinks a big jerk. He then quits and begins to clean pools with Alfie, the seventy year old guy who use to clean his old pool. You will not want to put this book down, especially at the sad yet joyous ending. Read POOLBOY, it's a great book to make you laugh, be mad, and even emotional."
4,A strong first novel,"I enjoyed this book, particularly the first and last chapters. However, I don't think I was quite as impressed with it as previous reviewers have been. I do think it is, for the most part, wonderfully written. I didn't always find the characters convincing, though, particularly in the middle chunk of the story, and there were certainly some anachronistic moments. That said, it's a well-crafted story with engaging characters that kept me interested from cover to cover. Also, given its length and fluidity, it's a quick read. If your tastes lean toward the more ""literary"" of today's writers, this is a book to pick up. However, I would warn potential readers that if books have the ability to depress you, you should either avoid this one, or try to read it all in one sitting. The ending is uplifting, but I paused about three-quarters of the way through and ended up moping around the house until I finished it. I'm curious to see what else Art Corriveau has to offer..."
2,Too modern by far,"This story doesn't feel like it's set in the 1920s. The problems seem too modern, and there is too much angst all around. The character of Hallie is not well developed; she turns into a one-dimensional monster. Some of the plot twists also don't ring true. Why was Oren fine when Ian was away at war, but suddenly stopped speaking when Ian moves to his own section of the house? I also didn't feel that Lily's ""psychic"" powers added much to the story - some were real; others not. What was the point?"
4,Very good book....wonderful character studies,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book - read it over a weekend. Great story about a young girl who grows up alone -- despite having 4 brothers -- yearning for someone to whom she can be close. A father and two sons come into town to build her family a house. The boys are twins and befriend the lonely girl. Years later, one of the twins comes back to marry her. Interesting portrayal of the twins, their longing for each other, yet for being separate...unspoken desire. There is hope, hurt, love, betrayal and loyalty -- all at once. This was our book club read and I know when we meet it will spark great debate."
5,Engaging storytelling! I want more.,"This is one of the two best books I've read recently (the other is Alice Sebold's The Lovely Bones). It sucks you right in and offers a wonderful sense of mystery (the relationship between the twins is quite mysterious), along with a great story.This book easily could have been a disaster in lesser hands. Romance, twins, historical setting...it's all elements for melodrama in someone else's book. But in this one, it all weaves together brilliantly. Perhaps the highest praise for a first novel, Mr. Corriveau knows when NOT saying anything is far more interesting than telling you too much. He's got the balance just right.BTW - I just recommended this to my friend for her bookclub. This one is perfect for reading and discussing."
3,Just So So,"I was a disappointed with this book. It was written okay, the premise of the story was good, but the novel fell short for me. There were too many vague issues that were never understood by me. Why did Oren stop speaking to Lily? Did Lily and Ian sleep together? It was sort of implied, but I'm not sure. Is Faith Ian's daughter? Not sure on that either. What was the point of Lily having ""visions?"" That never seemed to amount to anything. She saw things but it never served her. The visions didn't alter her life. I wasn't thrilled with this book. Some might like it, but as for me, if I'd never read it, I wouldn't feel like I missed anything."
2,Too Bulky,"I got this a while ago,found out it was too large and took up too much room.Not very handy to travel with."
2,Does not keep meds cool!,"Just purchased this to carry my vials of injectible meds in as it must be kept cool. However, today was the first time using it and was extremely disappointed. Upon following the instruction booklet that came with it, I refrigerated the insulated core case (not freezing, but refrigerating per the instructions) overnight for travel use today. We were on the road no more than an hour and the vials of meds were no longer cool but were just shy of room temperature. I was a little shocked at this. The case is very convenient for carrying everything, but certainly does not keep the meds cool as promises to up to 12 hours."
3,Bad Things Happen to Dumb People,"This book has been reviewed so many times I hesitated for a long time to add my tuppence.I gave up on The Q about 60% of the way through . . .and with some reluctance. The writing is wonderful; the evocation of the Regency period is better than most histories, and the literary visuals are splendid. I felt I was right in there with the huge cast of characters. Unfortunately so.Alas, the running narrative was a ceaseless, relentless torrent of awful things happening to the rather annoying protagonists who continually took the wrong turn in every road - both literally and metaphysically. And to what end? I know it had to be heading somewhere, but after 400 pages of a travelogue through a Dantesque hell in London, I simply didn't care.It all reminded my of the line the old man (Chaliapin) spoke in the movie ""Moonstruck"": ""Would somebody please tell a joke!""RHB"
2,Couldn't finish it,"I've read and enjoyed lots of long books, but quit several hundred pages into this one. The plot is very repetitive and confusing. In addition the overall tone is depressing. I cannot recommend it."
5,The new Dickens? Humbug!,"Charles Palliser has been called the new Charles Dickens ad nauseum, tho superficially that may seem apt. But Palliser's closer to Umberto Eco, especially in the Quincunx--it can be complex and tedious at times, but in the end all your hard work is well rewarded.If you enjoy Eco or Iain Pears, read this book!"
2,A chore instead of a pleasure,"I have never reviewed a book on Amazon before, but after two weeks of intense reading and note-taking, I have finally finished this book and have strong feelings about it: Although it provides good historical detail about daily life in nineteenth-century England (especially for the poor), I would not recommend it to anyone. Surely there are many other books with such detail that are not as grueling to read. My paperback edition has over 1,200 pages containing hundreds of characters, the backgrounds of all the family members of at least six different family lines, and an extremely convoluted plot. I love ""getting lost"" in a long novel, but about halfway through this one, I felt as if the author were presenting his readers with a test of endurance rather than a story to be enjoyed."
3,What can I say?,"I was attracted to this book by the title. I love genealogy and history and anything ""odd"" so it seemed perfect for me. However, in the long run I found the plot too confusing and convoluted. I kept having to turn back to refer to passages, and I'm sure I don't know how the hero John could have remembered all those details without a written reference.Seems to me that Mr. Palliser spent too much time on the historical detail (which is interesting, mind you), and too little on developing a really readable story."
2,Terrible book,"I really why this book is rated so high. To me, this book is not that great. The plot is ok; however, the writing style is sloppy. The author, an English professor, who keeps mixing between present tense and past tense in the same paragraph. The book contains so many unnecessarily lengthy sentences."
5,What we want from a novel,"It's a huge book with dozens of characters that submerged me completely. My only suggestion would be to include a glossary (and a few footnotes wouldn't hurt either). It's the kind of book, however, that you just can't wait to get back to reading and isn't that what we all look for in a novel?"
5,I can't put this down!,"This book is AWESOME. It is a huge conspiracy book with pieces to the puzzle on every page. This is one of those few books, i want to read all day and can't put down."
5,Mesmerizing,"After 4 non-stop days of sheer bliss, I have finished this wonderful book. I wish there was another to follow-up. But help--does anyone know who John's father was--Martin? I don't think Peter. Thanks for any illumination on this point. Do I really have to re-read it?"
2,A Very Big Book,"This book is for people who don't mind taking awhile to get INTO it, and I'm not one of those. I've tried to read this book three separate times -- the first because of wonderful reviews and the second two times after I'd read The Unburied by the same author and loved it (you can SMELL the dankness of the old buildings he talks about and feel the splinters in your feet from the sagging, leaning stairways in those buildings). I thought if Palliser could write one book that was so very good, I needed to just get into the big one and it would be very good, as well. Well, I never found that out. Never got further than probably page 100 and that was only by having skipped several pages of exposition. So my recommendation? If you like loooooooooooooong books, this may be your cup of tea, but if not, skip it, read The Unburied and maybe whatever new Palliser has in store."
1,I give up,"I'm sorry, but no matter how good they say this book is, I just can't get to like it, let alone finish it. Not everyone is into Victorian-era adventures. I borrowed it in 1990 or '91 from the library after reading Roger Ebert's enthusiastic critique but just couldn't get into it. I tried going over it over the decades - to no avail. A few years ago I bought a copy at a used bookstore and started reading it again but couldn't get even halfway. It just doesn't interest everyone. While I agree that it is well written, this a must read for those who are deep into literature only."
2,"Like ""The Jungle"" or the Book of Job","This book mostly concerns how poor and abused a boy and his mom can become. Everytime you think they've hit bottom, it gets worse. I finished this book, not out of a sense of joy or discovery, but just to do it. I kind of wish I hadn't as the end was a waste. If you want to be transported to another place and time read Shogun. If you want to say the word ""Dickensian"" over and over, read this. I don't recommend it."
1,"If you want Dickinsian, read Dickens.","I tried to read this book when it first came out and it became the first book I didn't finish. Until Quincunx, I always finished a book once started, figuring that there might be a gem by the end and a bad beginning shouldn't be a deterent. After 400 pages, I gave up. The mother and son went from one bad decision to the next undetered by intelligent thought. Their decisions were totally implausible. I found this book to be all that is bad about Dickins, with none of the good.I passed my copy on to a series of friends, who like me, coulnd't finish it. Long, difficult, challenging books are wonderful when the characters and plot are well thought out. Unfortunately none of this is the case in Quinconx."
1,I couldn't pick it up,"I tried to get through this mammoth novel, but gave up after about 250 pages. I tried, I tried... but it was so poorly written, the characters so unconvincing, the 'dramatic' scenes so contrived and trivial, that I had to jack it in. I give it 1 star because unfortunately there doesn't seem to be an option for '0 stars'. One of the direst novels I've ever tried to read."
1,Not what reading is supposed to be all about,"I need say nothing of the plot, as several reviews here have already done this quite well. Simply put, this is not a rewarding or enjoyable reading experience. Life is too short to spend on this kind of convoluted drivel. Do yourself a favor: put this down, throw it in the trash, and pick up a truly good book, of which there are thousands."
5,Goes Dickens one better,"I love Dickens-- don't get me wrong. But although people refer to this work as Dickensian, it is better than that. Most incredibly, this twisted convoluted intricate plot makes sense without resorting to Dickens's usual coincidence and accident. Moreover, there is a psychological darkness and depth here that Dickens never quite touched."
4,Great Detail!!,"I must say I greatly enjoyed this book. All the plots and subplots come together wonderfully in the end, and it's an absolute must read for anyone that enjoys a good (great!) mystery. I have just two small issues with this book:1. - and I know this goes contrary to most reviews but the last 100 pages or so should have been closer to 200. I felt the author himself got tierd and tied everything up too quickly. It's as if it wasn't fleshed out and rich like the rest of the book. I finished the book 2 days ago and I still feel I need to pick it up and read the end. So there's something missing for me.2. This is less of an issue, and if it were just for this I would have given it 5 stars. Just how many evil people can one guy run into without at least one good nice guy coming your way. At least this is how I felt 500 pages into the book. It detracted a bit from believability."
4,Real Sharp,"This is a product that is worth more than it's price.I've sharpened pocket knives, axes, and machetes. I'm in the tropics and it has held up well.A bargain at twice the price."
2,Not really a sharpener,"This tool works more like a steel than a sharpener. If you have high-quality blades and want razor sharp edges, you'll be disappointed with this tool. The ceramic wheel simply isn't hard enough to sharpen hardened metal knives."
3,outdoor pizza grill,The Outdoor Pizza grill works great. The only thing was the non stick coating came off on the bottom of my pizza crust. The bottom of the pizza was silver. I can't imagine that could be too healthy. I contacted Eastman directly and they quickly sent me a replacement. I haven't tried the new one yet as I'm a little afraid the same thing might happen.
1,Would not recommend,"Wellll,If you like pizza crust with paint enamel stuck to it this is your pan. I used it and most of the enamel from the pan came off onto my crust. Amazon as usual was fast on delivery but the product was.. well a dissapointment."
2,MAJOR PROBLEM WITH THIS PRODUCT,"I ordered this item before reading all the reviews. after I ordered one review caught my eye. Seriously flawed was the title. the reviewer went on to say the teflon coating on the pan peeled off after the second use. I thought that must be a rare occurrence. wrong. the teflon peeled if on the first pizza. very disappointed, since the pizza was excellent. i;mnow buying a stainless steel pan to use with the base. be careful coating is no good base is good at keeping bottom from burning. lesson learned? read as many reviews as possible."
2,The teflon peeled off after the 2nd time I used it!,"After reading all the positive reviews I was so excited to use this...followed all directions. The 1st pizza came out great, but the 2nd time I used it the teflon started peeling off! Has this happened to anyone else? I am unable to use it as it now has a rusty smell..."
3,Not so great,I'm a little disappointed because of the rave reviews on this product. The thing with this product is that the top pizza part isn't entirely nonstick. If you look clearly the handles that are attached are clear metal which is not nonstick. This is probably not an issue if you remember not to overload your pizza with too much that would melt to that area.The top portion is pretty good but the bottom heat shield thing is a strange thing. It's painted black and should something cooking drip down... most likely it will be encrusted. If you try to clean that out it will review a metallic surface.
2,Can't believe the coating still peels off this product !,"I love to grill pizza on my kamado style grill, but I've always had issues with burning the edges of the crust. This product, by design, fixes that problem. Issue is, the black coating on the perferated pizza pan flakes off. I read the other reviews complaining of this problem, but I thought the defect in design would have been taken care of by now - I was wrong."
2,works good but...,"The concept is great and it does cook good. The problem are 3 fold. First of all it was packaged very poorly so it was damaged. We called to discuss and they promply sent another one. This one was even more damaged. Secondly, the units are cheesy. Poor quality in materials and craftmanship. Third, the coating on the pan flacked of on its first use. I went out and bought a new pan and threw the original one out."
1,Non-stick coating sticks to the pizza,See my picture. The coating came off the pan and stuck to the bottom of our fist pizza. It ruined an otherwise perfect pie. Too bad. It seemed like a great product until we used it.
1,Non-stick flakes off...unusable!,This pan would have been good if the non-stick surface would have stayed on the pan...instead it stuck to the bottom of my carefully created pizza..loss of good food. Who wants to eat plastic?
1,fails expectations,"I recieved the grill in a timely manner. There were some reviews that mentioned they had trouble with the non-stick coating coming off on the pizza dough when thye used it the first time. I ignored there warnings since there were many more reviews that claimed they had no issues with the grill. I guess I wasn't one of the fortunate ones!!! After one use, all the non stick coating was on the outside rim of my pizza and no longer on the pan. Eastman responded promptly to my inquiry about getting another pan and using non-stick spray on the new pan. Then two days later after confirming that they would ship a new one out at their expense, I recieved a message that they are back ordered. Did I want to wait or get a refund from Amazon. I have chosen to wait since the pizza does cook fantastic on the grill. Currently waiting in Columbus, OH."
5,Loved this Zagrill,"Have used the ZaGrill several times, works great and is definately fun at a get together, everyone loved making their own pizzas. Deffinately a good value!"
4,Za Grill Works Well,"I use this for hand-tossed pizzas and it works quite well. It takes about 11 minutes to cook in a grill that has been pre-heated about 15 minutes. The pizza cooks evenly and the crust is perfectly done. My only gripe is that I wish you could get a bigger pan so that one could cook a larger (14-17"") pizza."
3,Quality not what I hoped,"I received the product very quickly but unfortunately the product didn't look as much like the picture as I'd hoped. There was more shading on the ball, obsuring it slightly. and, the t-shirt is fairly thin in quality. Understandable for the price I suppose."
3,Well written prose going nowhere,"Terry Tempest Williams has a lovely writing style, and she needs it to pull off the extreme abstractions she writes about. I couldn't finish the book because the subject was way too contemplative. It is only engaging because of her amazing ability to compose one beautiful sentence after another, a work of art in itself.If you enjoy going places deep in your mind, you may enjoy this book. I thought that was me, but it kept me wondering--is this going anywhere? After a while it was just tiresome."
2,Not Long lasting,"The silver coating can go off very easily. So will not be good for long term storage.Out of the package, some of the cds were sticking together. And the silver coating started coming out on one of them.Probably will work if i can get some kind of a sticker to cover the top. Don't know if there is something like that in the marketAnother reviewer noted that they are advertised as such. Its true. So incase you want a set of cheap cdr for a short term usage or temporary storage, it might be a good buy."
4,Not bad...,These discs work good...these are Prodiscs. I have never had a problem with this brand. These have shiny silver tops so it's easy to damage the top and have it start flaking off on you but any silver top media will do that...I'm not disappointed...high speed 52x/silver tops... as advertised
2,Much better sources out there.,"Although I agree with some of Hunt's points in this work, I cannot stand the way he presents them. He (as always) presents his views in a very arrogant way that makes the reader either feel stupid, offended or equally arrogant having read it. It may give out good info, but it's too hard to sift through the bad to get to the good. There are MUCH better choices out there for apologetics."
1,"This book should be called ""In Defense of Self Publishing""","Oh boy, can a book be more out of touch with reality than this one? Obviously, the author self published his own beliefs. HELLO! It's not a mystery to see that going on. I couldn't help but think, ""What does this guy do? Sit around all day and pretend he's an author?"" Look, folks, read someting else. This book misses the broad side of the barn."
5,great screen cleaner,"This product really cleans my computer screen! I am not afraid of it spilling to my keyboard, I spray it even with my computer on! It sprays light mists and does not flow down, the mist stays in place. It comes with micro cloth that I used to wipe it with, so no paper towels residue.I would definitely recommend it . Use it everyday. Bought 3 of them so I can save on shipping! Free shipping!"
4,Collin's Review,"I liked the book because I liked the characters and that it's sort of an action book. Also because a guy still lives lives after something terrible happens.The book is about a thief who is name Montmorency is running away from the police and he falls through a glass roof. He should have died but a surgeon sewed him back up and then went to prison for three years. After he gets out of jail he robs another bank and escapes again. Montmorency is a thief and a gentleman. He is a gentleman because in the day time he doesn't steal or rob anything he acts like a normal person, but at night he robs and steals but escapes from getting caught by escaping through the sewers.What type of reader would like this book is a reader that likes action books. Also if the reader likes to read about robberies and stealing."
3,Strange but holds interest,"Montmorency is a strange story of a thief who takes on two identities at opposite ends of the social spectrum in 1870s England. I would be surprised if any young reader would find its hero and his grown-up problems interesting, but as an adult, I found the story intriguing, if a bit slow."
5,Montmorency is one criminal turned gentleman you won't soon forget!,"Montmorency is such a fascinating, well-written series--you must NOT miss any of these four books, and if you love them, please please please write to Eleanor Updale's publisher in London and tell her how much you want to read a fifth book, as her new editor is apparently undecided as of yet if there WILL be a fifth book! You will want to tear through every single page to get to the end of the fourth book, which leaves you hanging unpleasantly, but I'm sure things will turn out well in the fifth book! (Oh please let there be A FIFTH BOOK!)"
4,Looking for sequels,"Fast paced and elegant, this novel packs plenty of believable detail into this story of a thief's transformation into a decent 'gentleman'. Quite enjoyable and well worth reading. I look forward to a sequel."
2,Good filter until it leaks,Great filter until it leaked about 4 months of use the plastic housing cracked. Spraying water everywere. Thankfully we were home to manually hut the valve off
1,Same leaking/flood problem as others - huge dissapointment,"We have had this unit for about a year and a half and have carefully replaced the filters four times. We initially loved the ""easy snap in"" change and all was well - the 4 level filter seems to do a great job and we didn't notice much restriction; each lasted about 5 months. This week's replacement was different, though - we woke up to a HUGE flood in our kitchen with a ton of damage. Came back here and saw a number of other people have had the same problem. I can't quite see if it's the main part or the filter, but it sounds like it might be a breakdown of the base (although we don't see any cracks, but can see the leaks and drips all around the top part.) This should not be happening after only a year and a half.Has anyone contacted Culligan? I have emailed them and will update this review if I hear back."
1,Good Filter but ...,Good filter but... Does a great job of cleaning water but the plastic filter case cracked after only 28 days of use and flooded our kitchen !
1,Can't stop the leaks,This is a good filter but it constantly leaks. I've changed the filter head and the filters themselves several times and it still leaks.
5,Culligan refill cartridges,I saved 35% on these standard refill cartridges by buying them on amazon.com They were $52.00 at my local big box store and $38.00 each on Amazon.
3,????,"I typically write good reviews, but this product was a disappointment. It looks great. It's packaged well, and initially it worked wonderfully. But recently a yellow flashing L.E.D. came on indicating that the filter needs to be changed soon. However, I only installed the product around the first of the year, (2013) and have not gone through the 500 gallons before the filter needs to be changed. In addition, I have called Culligan customer support, who informed me that they do not support the product because it is branded Culligan but not made by them. They provided a local Culligan contact who was unable to address my flashing L.E.D. concern. Unbelievably, the L.E.D. is not even mentioned in the Culligan RC-EZ-4 instruction manual. Overall the Culligan RC-EZ-4 is a good product but my personal experience with the L.E.D. has tainted my opinion of this product."
5,Good Filter,I have this product set on auto delivery and it's very convenient.Price is good and easy to install. Would recommend.
3,Yeah There Are Beats,A DJ's tool but not really made for listening. There are several good beats and even vocals in limited supply. This CD is made for mixing.
1,Just a greatest hits cd nothing new,It would be cool if were actually a new album instead of just a greatest hits cd.They trick new listeners into buying this cd thinking its a new album.
1,Don't Trust the Title,"I ordered this item because I was looking for a base for the Burkhart's Day Counter E712-50 Financial Calendar. This item was suggested to me in the online chat with Amazon. However, you need to look closely at the Technical remarks. The E19-00 will not fit the E712-50 refill. It is NOT 5 X 8"". Now I have to go thru the hassel of returning this item."
2,Very dated look at full timing.,"This truly is a journal. It's a dated look at the day to day occurrences for a couple who spent a year in their RV. This book is at least 13 yrs old and is showing its age. There was one reference to getting gasoline for $1.06 per gallon. Ahhh, those were the days.I wish the author went more into what was necessary to accomplish a whole year of RVing but all this book is is a listing of what they did. For example they would talk about going to an event and how they hooked up at a site but wouldn't discuss what one has to do to accomplish this. Even once would have been enlightening.As a light travelogue this is an OK read but it doesn't really bring a lot to the table when it comes to being the complete package about full timing it."
4,If your going to RV read this,"Good read with great information, written with a good sense of humor. Very good guide to life on the road and some things that demonstrate the value of doing your homework first."
1,Very dated and slow,"Theis book was written in 1998 and if you care about what the author had for lunch, how he liked it, and what kind of mood the waitress was in it could be for you. Otherwise steer clear."
1,I don't think I've listened to worse cover songs...,"With the exception of Johnny Ramone's cover of ""What a Wonderful World"", I found that all of the covers on this cd, in addition to the new songs, were horrible. I was appalled. The sole fact that any self-respecting band would cover ""...Baby One More Time"" makes me want to cut off my ears so that I do not have to listen to it. Maybe it's just me, but these are the worst covers I have ever heard, and this is one of the worst soundtracks I have ever had the displeasure of listening to."
3,"KINDA GOOD,BUT GET`S ANNOYING!","THIS CD IS GOOD AT FIRST,BUT GET`S REAL ANNOYING!!!!!!!!I HATE LINDSAY LOHAN KNOW,AND THIS JUST IS`NT A GOOD SOUNDTRACK!!!!!!!!"
4,Fresh Twist On Some Old Favorites,"The majority of this CD contains cover songs of some older tunes like ""What a Wonderful World,"" ""Happy Together,"" and ""Baby One More Time."" While I will always love and cherish the originals, I found that I really liked the newer versions. Besides the cover songs, there are some other wonderful tunes such as ""Take Me Away"" sung by Christina Vidal and ""Me Vs. the World"" by the Halo Friendlies. The only song that I thought didn't necessarily belong on this CD was ""She is Beautiful"" by Andrew W.K. To me, it just didn't fit in with the whole vibe of the C.D. But the rest of the CD is a great mix."
4,Nice CD!,"I bought this cd and it is quite good!I love the song 'Ultimate'!!!Hilary Duff is good but Linday Lohan is even better!I kept reccomending this cd to everyone in school!If you want to hear music, buy this cd!"
2,Crap soundtrack,"All in all this soundtrack was not very good. i thought it would be alot better. Is that song ""dont want to grow up"" even on it."
4,Freaky Friday Rules!,"This soundtrack is really really good. In fact, I am listening to it right this very moment. It has really hip music, mostly rock, and has lots of remakes of old songs that are funkier. I just got it last night and have already listened to the entire cd 3 times through (now is my 4th). My favorite track is #2 which is ""Happy Together"" by Simple Plan. I would really recomend that you buy this cd if you like rock and/or liked the music in Freaky Friday."
4,Linsey Rocks!,"Lindsey has a great voice and her song ""The Ultimate"" is awesome. She has grown up a lot since The Parent Trap and I'm sure she will only continue to get better."
2,ahh..2.5,"'Brand New Day' by Forty Foot Echo is the best song on this album. The album doesn't do the movie justice, really. It's a great, funny movie but the soundtrack isn't the best. 'Ultimate' by Lindsay Lohan (the star of the movie) is OK, I like her voice but the song could have done better. Simple Plan sucks and always will. Lillix's version of 'What I Like About You' is an insult. Ashlee Simpson's song 'Just Let Me Cry' sounds like a ballad but it's more of a rip off of No Doubt's song 'X-Girlfriend'. 'She Is Beautiful' by Andrew W.K is good, he's got better music on his new album ""The Wolf"" though. In all, this soundtrack isn't that bad but it's not the best either. For I know a talented, beautiful young actress like Lindsay Lohan can do much better than this."
4,A good pop music soundtrack,"Putting my music tastes aside, this is a well put together pop soundtrack. I recently saw the movie and some of the songs, namely, 'The Art of Losing' by American Hi-Fi, and 'Brand New Day' by Forty Foot Echo caught my attention so I decided to purchase the cd for something to listen to when I'm not in my typical headbanging, screaming rock music mood. ( Contrary to popular belief, those days do happen. ) I wasn't shocked to find that 'The Art of Losing' was censored, but what do you expect from a Disney soundtrack? All in all, I like this cd, but if you are closed minded about music and always have to listen to ""rock"" or ""punk,"" then I would skip by this one, but you don't know what you're missing!"
3,Good... but nothing great,"Like the movie, this soundtrack is good, but nothing great. It starts out with the song Ultamate, which is Disney's attempt to make more money. Like Hilary Duff from the Lizzie Mcguire movie, this is the star of the movie (Lindsay Lohan) trying to become a singer, and I'm sure her own cd will be coming out soon... Other artst on the cd are Simple plan that do a cover of The Turtles song, Happy Together. The next song that's better is another cover. What I like about you, by Lillix. And then theres the best song on the cd, which is a cover of Britney Spears Baby one more time resung by Bowling for Soup. The other notable song is Beautiful World by Joey Ramone.Like I said, it's nothing great, so if you want it, buy it. If you haven't seen the movie or anything like that, forget it."
3,What is the name of the song?,"The cd was ""okay"". It wasn't ALL that great. Does anyone know the name of the song that Lindsay Lohan's group sings in the movie?"
3,Turtles v. Simple Plan,"I have to admit to only listening to this music as it was presented in the movie; I thought it was pretty good stuff.What I really want to talk about right about though is the Simple Plan cover of The Turtles ""Happy Together."" Let me begin by saying I have no problem with cover songs as long as they are better. The Simple Plan version is by no means better, it strips away the trumpet, the harmonies and all the other orchestration that made the original brilliant and haunting. The new version in no way achieves what the Lemonheads did with ""Mrs. Robinson"" instead it just turns a great song into a kitschy piece of corporate punk. The only band out there right now capable of handling such production is Belle and Sebastian and they are busy writing masterpieces of their own.While I don't think it would be fair to suggest you not buy this CD, I do suggest you boycott unnecessary covers that only cheapen the original song, as well as any other releases of this song by Simple Plan."
3,Okay,"Some of the songs here are a little TOO punky and over the edge, and it starts to get annoying, but overall, I like the songs, my fav is Simple Plan and the one by Christina Vidal. I do not advise you to buy this unless u are a total punk fan and like loud sound over and OVER and OVER again."
4,Depressing,"Having read a handful of Willeford's later novels, I was curious to discover what his novels from the 50's were like. If ""The Pick-Up"" is in any way typical of his work from this period, then they are all very noir and almost hysterically downbeat. The ""Pick-Up"" documents the love-affair of two alcoholic losers who are so hopeless that they decide to commit suicide fifty pages through the novel. They don't succeed. This and other sordid incidents comprise the book's ""plot"", all culminating in a surprise ending that has lost its shock value in recent years and doesn't add too much to the book's meaning. I still recommend it, especially if you enjoy wallowing in the grimier aspects of human existence. Favorite passage: ""She let her hair go uncombed. She skipped wearing her stockings. Her voice was slightly louder and she seemed to be getting deaf in one ear. We never made love any more."""
3,a story of despairing alcoholics; we've seen it all beforer,"'Pick-Up' by cult crime novelist Charles Willeford is, surprise!, not really a crime story. It is actually a very depressing account of an alcoholic who finds love (..er, or something like it) with another alcoholic in the seedy parts of San Francisco circa 1965. The story is a about drink, drunken behaviour, and despair. Towards the end the story does ""pick up"" (no spoilers here) but by that time this reader was so depressed by it all that I felt more bored than engaged with the story.'Pick-Up' is by no means a poorly written story. The characterizations are fine but perhaps a bit thin (..well, it is a short novel). However there are a great many films/novels which address alcoholism better than this book. It is by no means amongst Willeford's better efforts; it falls way short of his 'Miami Blues' written many years later.Bottom line: competent but unengaging."
4,NOT TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY.,"If you want to see this movie remember to tell your self this ""This is not Hero or House of Flying Daggers."" this movie is baiscally a light hearted comedy with very little action. This movie also focuses on the romance more than anything else. So if you have high expectation that this movie is going to be epic the you a setting your self up for a huge disapointment. But if you keep in mind to what I wrote here and keep your expectations low then you will most likely enjoy this movie. Rememeber DON""T TAKE IT SERIOUSLY."
2,eh,"Wasn't impressed by this movie at all. It's half martial arts flick, half comedy but not good at either really.Who should buy this movie: If you like Cecelia Cheung or movies like the Promise, Legend of Zu (or warriors of zu mountain whichever the new one is called), or Wu Yen then you might like this movie. Otherwise I'd skip it."
5,A different type of Martial Arts film from a Huge Romantic,I loved this movie. Wow no more sad or depressing ending!!!! Finally love prevails. I am huge fan of Martial Art movies but someone always dies or misses an opportunity for love. This movie was great.
4,A comedy!,"I expected an action movie, but this is a hongkong action teen love story. It's a comedy with a ton of visual takes and a heart warming story to boot. I was disappointed at first, having expected an action flick, but once I gave it a chance, actually enjoyed it. Not a bad movie. Check it out some time."
4,good humor,great movie for action fans as well as some good comedy it would be nice to have a part 2 the movie is that great.I would recommend to all ages.
5,"Fantastic Romance, Martial Arts, Touch of Comedy",Some Idiot compared this film to Seven Swords and The Emporer and the Assassin ...he is simple minded when it comes to Asian Arts and Films...This isn't to be put in the Category of those films....This is a Martial Arts / Romance about a Stuck up girl and a Humble man who was a mercenary for hire who saved his money to receive his sight....Two who wound up falling in love...It is Great!..A Worth See...But don't watch it in it's Original Language First IF you plan on watching it in English Dubbed..Cause the Original Language is BEST! and the English Dubbed is rather Stupid and don't fit the characters AT ALL! ....Enjoy This Film...
2,"TCM Greatest Classic Collection: Legends - Erroll Flynn ( The Adventures of Robin Hood, etc)","After previosly purchasing (TCM Spotlight: Errol Flynn Adventures (Desperate Journey / Edge of Darkness 1943 / Northern Pursuit / Uncertain Glory / Objective Burma) DVD ~ Errol Flynn [DVD] From atthemoviesco ) and being extremely pleased with its presentation and high quality, I ordered this collection and was very diasppointed. It did not live up to my expectations. Two discs with Side A and Side B. Not pleased at all"
5,AHOY BOYS!,"Talk about a Boys Own collection. Three classic Flynn films that, apart from Burt Lancaster in The Crimson Pirate, define the swashbuckler genre. And the last of his main roles in Don Juan. A star who epitomised male sexuality in the 40's - 50's these films are politically incorrect and all the better for it. Simpler times, not necessarily better, but much simpler. Ok, double sided discs dont thrill me, but the movies are in good condition, clear and with numerous extras, and you simply cannot go wrong for the price. I would suggest buying the special edition of Robin Hood however as it is superb. Aside from the afore mentioned Crimson Pirate, the Flame and the Arrow, and Tyrone Powers movies Mark of Zorro and the Black Swan, these Flynn movies are THE swashbuckling adventures that Johnny Depp and the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise grew from. They are superb. As for Don Juan, I haven't watched it yet - it simply came with the others as part of the package."
5,Errol Flynn Classics,"For anyone who is a film buff of the golden days, this is a must. Would certainly purchase this collection again."
4,Errol Flynn,"Great! Was trying to find a whole of these for my friend. When i received them, they (my friend) didnt want them. Due to the fact they had gone to a place in another city n bought all four these dvds over there. I told them-- I got mine for a lot cheaper and they showed up on time. So nyahynyah to my buddies."
4,"Not excellent, but worth checking out.","As someone who knows quite a lot already about North Korea (including having visited there - though by no means suggesting that makes me an expert), much of it covered themes or ""facts"" (in quotes because of the difficulty about being certain re: many specifics regarding North Korea) of which I was already aware; its real value for me, thus, was in its personal interviews of defectors and their experiences, whether it be in prison camps or former servants of the elite. One particular thing about it I found quite irritating were these 'interpretive dance' segments that were interspersed throughout the film; I felt these melodramatic excerpts actually detracted from my concentration on reflecting on the intensity of many of the defectors' personal stories. Overall, though, I'd say it was interesting and I would recommend it, though it would also be useful to supplement it with other North Korean documentaries."
1,not that great,"I am a big guy, these boots last me about 4 months and then the rubber on the base of the sole tends to rot out / erode to the point where they split.I really liked these at first but the leather is cheap, and is not fully stained, I have scuffed them mildly and then have had to try to fill in the scuffs with shoe polish."
3,They don't make 'em like they used to...,"Amazon reminded me my last one was bought 11 years ago, in 2001. After a decade of use I was really shocked that it snapped after being dropped on the lawn. Even so, cheap enough so I bought another. Should have read the reviews. Someone else's snapped, and most importantly, no ruler on the edge. At 150% of 2001 pricing a buck silk screen really isn't too much to ask. Still, the guy who said hideous color, perfect, was spot on. No missing this even in the mud with this color.I would have given my old, fluorescent green one five stars. This one, sans rule but with propensity to break I'm voting at three. So five on color, three on quality, zero on the rule. Three stars overall. Bummer, I really wanted something better at this price point."
3,too deep,This product is ok -- average -- so so. The last few pockets are way too deep and thus useless. Other than that it is ok.
2,Poor Design,"The roll is WAY too large for anything other than long pattern Snap-on wrenches or similar. I have no idea what they were thinking when they designed this monstrosity as the designer surely did not experiment with actually putting standard wrenches in it. The pockets are just too deep to be of any use. It is really close to worthless because it just takes up too much space and the wrenches get lost in the overly large pockets. Also, it is not cotton duck and it is made in China. I found other rolls by Tool Pak and they are 100 percent better."
5,Bucket Boss Brand 07003 Wrench Roll,"If I can't tell Everyone that this item is less expensive at Sears, than I'm wasting my time. This item is well made and handy. It keeps my wrenchs organized in my tool box that I keep in my truck and has proved to be very durable."
2,Too deep,The wrench pockets are just too deep for typical wrenches. I'm keeping mine but I'm going to have to hem the bottom with my sewing machine.
2,Good materials. Bad design.,"Sturdy material but bad design.The pockets, particularly on the large end, are simply too big/deep. The biggest pocket is about 15 inches deep. Measure your tools first.I can still get it to work if I insert the wrenches up to the heads and fold up the bottom but, let's face it, one should not have to do this.I was in Sears today and saw a similar item for about $1 cheaper but made of canvas. It looked like it might have the same types of flaws.If your wrenches are extra long (as I guess some expensive premium wrenches are)this item may perhaps work for you.If your wrenches are, as in my case, a set you bought on X-mas special at ACE, this wrench roll is not for you."
5,Great item at a great price,The best way to travel with or organise your wrenches. Well made and will last for years and years and years.
4,Excellent Wrench Wrap,"An excellent wrench roll-up that looks like it can stand a lot of abuse and had a top fold over to hold the larger wrenches in place when it's rolled & tied. If it had 2 more slots it would be ideal & would accommodate a full set of open/closed end wrenches from 1/4"" to 1 1/4"" - I need to double up on 2 of the small slots."
4,JUST WHAT I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR.,"I BOUGHT THE WRENCH ROLL FOR WORK SINCE MY HARBOR FREIGHT WRENCH RIPPED APART THE CHEAP ROLL THEY CAME WITH. THIS IS GREAT FOR CARRYING ALL MY LARGE WRENCHES, ONLY WISH IT HAD TWO MORE SMALLER POCKETS FOR ALL MY WRENCHES AND MAYBE A CARRYING STRAP WOULD BE NICE. OTHER THAN THAT IT'S WELL MADE AND STURDY."
2,Not what I hoped for,"The longer pockets were too narrow, I could not fit my entire wrench set in due to the width. Construction is good, just would like the longer pockets, a bit wider."
4,Good value,Well constructed and just what I expected when ordered.. The material is quite sturdy and the grommets are perfect for hanging on pegboard.
5,River Dance,"This River Dance Live From Beijing may wellbe the best ever done.If you love River Dance like I do,you will add this to your collection."
2,Too Much Audience,"I bought this DVD at a show and when I got home, I was extremely disappointed. The camera shots were, in my opinion, 75% too much audience and too much ceiling. I want to see their feet, not the top of their bodies and the lighting. If I could have asked for a refund, I would have. Now I am search of another Riverdance that fulfills my needs."
1,"Makes great coffee, but only when it works","Had heard great things about this machine, so finally saved up enough cash to buy one from the Saeco dealer in Vancouver, BC in 2008.Almost immediately started having problems with error messages: ""Fill container with coffee"" (even though container was full) Took it back three times to dealer, first two times they were really rude and told me there was nothing wrong with machine. Third time, with warranty running out, they replaced the grinder and it worked fine for about two months.Same old problem returned, took it back, same attitude from dealer.Now we have new error message: ""Close water/steam knob"" that won't go away and machine is frozen. Clears up a day or two later, make a few coffees, freezes up again.Absolutely no support from Saeco.Took machine to Vancouver dealer this week and guess what? They're out of business and the office is empty.Absolutely no way we will buy Saeco again. Highly priced, and abyssmal after sales service and support."
2,Four returns for repair in 3.5 years... don't touch it!!,"This Taleo Ring has been in Saeco service four times in 3 1/2 years, and now... it's broken again. Previously it was the steam wand leaking, but now its the main controls are broken and it won't start at all.If you know what's good for you, avoid this model (and maybe all Saeco products)."
1,RIP OFF DELUX!,"This series is a total rip off. Short ""books"" over priced, hackneyed plotting, repetitive and really expensive. If you've gotten in this deep seek an intervention before you get as far in as I did (8 of them). Think about it, I've spent $73 on this -- I'll admit it--- really stupid on my part."
5,Great New Book,"There are three guys in love with Gaia right now. Count them. Three. Sam, Ed, and now David. David, the new guy. He's intriguing. Intelligent. Dangerous. Interesting. Mysterious. And interested in Gaia. But what she's happy about, is the fact that he's not Sam.Another great book in the FEARLESS series. Teen fans will relish in Pascal's skill of writing intriguing books about an abnormal teenage girl, who also goes through the things that normal teenage girls go through. A must-have book.(...)"
3,This one is okay...,"This is another of those ""not bad/not great"" books. It is simple and easy to understand, and touches on a number of subjects. I just found it to be rather ""blah."""
3,"Quite good, but some issues are not well explained","The book doesn't explain some parts of the c language as clearly as it has to be explained. To understand some of them you'll need to read these parts twice or more times.Someone who has no idea about c, will understand the principles but if you ask this person to explain to another one what he understood, this person will have refer itself to the book several times.I think this is because some subjects are not DEEPLY explained. Also, there are some punctuation mistakes that could make the reader misunderstand some parts. But let's say this book is quite good for beginners. (If it was possible, I'd give this book 2.5 stars instead of 3)"
2,"If you're looking for a book from which to learn C++, keep looking.","This is not the one. The book is just swarming with typos and programming errors. But don't take my for it, just check out O'Reilly's errata page. The most astonishing thing is that they accidentally omitted an entire chapter. Even after I painstakingly marked every correction in the errata list, I was finding more errors constantly. The other major fault is that it is just too full of ideology, which has its place of course, but he's gone way overboard with it in a book that should be primarily about the language. If you happen to find a copy in the trash, you might give it a skim, but otherwise, I'd avoid it."
3,"Good, but errors and lack of depth detract","Overall, the book offers a balanced and well-presented introduction to C++. However, there are too many typos and mistakes for a programming text. O'Reilly needs to kick their editing team into gear. In addition, many topics could and should be explained more in-depth. As is, many topics are only lightly touched on and more of the nuts and bolts of the language (i.e. characteristics that really lead to a quality understanding) are omitted."
4,Very Entertaining,"This was a great Sherlock Holmes story. It really caught the Holmes spirit. The history/conspiracy part was a little shaky, though."
5,"An excellent read, authetic in every respect.","One of the best latter-day Sherlockian works I've read--and I've read a lot of them. The author does a masterful job of portraying the Holmes and Watson we've grown to love, while placing them into a completely alien environment--the United States. Many have tried this and failed, but Christopher Leppek does a near-perfect job. The plot is appropriately dramatic and, while historically unlikely, it's skillfully constructed and has a definite ring of authenticity. It's pure fiction, of course, but a good author can persuade his reader not to care-- and I found Mr. Leppeck to be a very good author."
2,"Good on process, low on recipe's","The book covers the process of smoking well. Good information on brining, sausage making, and processing smoked foods is provided. It lacks fundamental data such as internal temperatures of smoke cook meats. A few recipes are presented, but this is not a cookbook."
2,Limited Value,"This book tries to cover everything and succeeds at very little. It covers everything from how to build a smoker from a used refrigerator to recipes. But.. none of these topics are covered extensively or very well.The illustrations are weak; the recipes are very weak; and, the general process discussions are haphazardly organized.I bought this book on the strength of the other reviews, but am very disappointed."
2,OH DEAR!,"Lloyd Webber's final collaboration with Tim Rice culminated in this fine musical/opera, Evita. It tells the story of the rise to power of Argentinan Eva Peron who married Juan Peron and reformed the country. This musical has a concept album, Broadway and London cast recordings, a recording of the recent film, but also - this. This studio recording tries to make the best of the singers/actors and the band they have, but unfortunately this recording loses to lack of talent!I'm sorry to say it, but Alice Haywood as Eva is dreadful. Gone is the singing, gone is the acting, all we are left with is a poorly pronouncing, screaming, annoying, unmoving performance. I would be grateful if Ms. Haywood would kindly inform me as to where 'Bwaynoz Ayreez' is!Other performances are bearable, but the band loses the lyrical touches of Lloyd Webber's score, leaving this an unmoving, unanything recording!"
3,Ummm,"Wow!! I really like Peron's Mistress. She is the first one who doesn't get all shrill ""hAPPens now""!!But is this girl shrieking the Eve parts the undertsudy- what the heck?? She makes me want Madonna!"
2,ToughLove Manuel,"The book was very stained when I recieved it. I would not have gotten it there if I knew that! I got an extra one, because my kids are grown, but I give it to people that may be going through a tough time with a difficult child. This I will NOT pass on. I am disapointed. Never got this before with amazon.com"
3,Royale Leather Executive Office Chair,I purchased 4 of the Royale Leather Executive Office chairs/High backw/Gas Lift and Tilt and Ergonomic Lumbar Support. The gas lift & tilt mechanism does not work on any of them. While they look good they are worthless if you want to do more than swivel and roll them.
4,good chair for the price,"excellent chair, easy to put together. Anyone who breaks the sidearms is simply refusing to release the lock that holds the back in place. There is no need to break this excellent chair."
4,Fragile Chair!!!,"Be careful in using this chair. Sit down, don't drop. Don't lean back too far. Don't 'abuse' in any way. Use gently. Don't lean back quickly. Don't swivel quickly. Don't lean to one side or the other too much. Reduce wear and tear as much as possible on a daily basis. Enjoy!"
2,OFFICE CHAIR!,Well I purchased 2 chairs thru Amazon. When the chairs arrived that were exactly what was displayed. Very nice. But after two and a half months the chairs gas lift broke on one of them. I sent an email to the vendor on 1-8-07 and still have not heard anything from them. I run a buisness and use this chair for our frontdesk. I was hoping this matter could have been taken care of with a little more customer service! I hope that in the next couple of days they will get back to me regarding this purchase and rectify the situation.
1,item from HELL,"part was missing found replacement,installed on winshield worked well first timesecond time shade retracted in a bundled mess unable to get shade to rectract without bundling with missing part delay time ran out fof refundSierra Tools Retractable Sun Shade"
1,Poorly made product!!,"The 2 parts don't come together very easily. When it is unattached to retract, it snaps very quickly & does not fold up correctly!! Very poorly made product!! The material that it is made out of is horrible!!"
2,retractable windshield screen,"I prefer the convenience of easy-close window screen. I had one before that was 1pc that stretched across the full windshield, this one is in 2 halves that meet in the middle. Retractability does not work well with material (mylar?) that the screen is made of. Screen gets hot and too pliable. I would love to see one made in another material, perhaps fabric (like some window blinds I have in my home). Pleats do not come back into place neatly. I hope someone improves what should be a good covering solution for cars."
3,Very Small Pieces,This set has very tiny pieces. The hair on the people will not stay on and the tent is very flimsy. It is ok but if I had a choice I would not buy again. This set would be perfect for a decorating a cake or gluing in a display box.
5,Fun toy - and great for cake decoration,"My family bought me this toy as a cake decoration: I got a beautiful homemade cake for my birthday with a complete camping scene on it. All the details are very nice. The bonus was that after we'd eaten the cake, my kids had a lot of fun playing with the parts. No complaints at all!"
4,Good game,"Fun game, haven't had a lot of time to play it, but it is good so far. Graphics seem better with expansion pack."
5,Very Fun,"Army Men Sarge's Heroes is a classic. Not only is it fun for kids, it also holds appeal of adults for its classic gameplay and storyline. Because the game is on the Nintendo 64 game console it has low graphics quality on flatscreen TV's and tube TV's alike, but this is to be expected. This game offers high replayablilty due to its ""code"" system, allowing you to to put in a code that corresponds with the level you would like to play. These codes are given after the completion of the level. Overall this game holds five stars all around and should definetly be considered for those who still own the classic Nintendo 64.Pros:High replayabliltyFun for kids and adults alikeNot too dificult of a control schemeCons:Poor video resolution (though it is to be expected)"
5,"Cool, Good Story, Fun, and Easy to Play","This is a classic. The controls are easy, you can learn in five minutes although I must admid turning can be annoying because of sluggishness. Missions are not hard, but they are not easy. A good intermediate game. Large selection of weapons - m-16, 50 caliber, flamethrower, mortar, mines, etc. Fun battles between the green and tan men, to go with a good story. Good graphics and realism, but no sickening violence. Good for kids and adults. Multiplayer is awesome. Codes are also given after each level."
4,pretty sweet game,sweet game. awesome graphics. love the plast-o-sheen coating. control is just a bit loose. easy to learn and not to difficult to beat.lots of great levels and characters. AND ONE GREAT STORYLINE AND CINEMA ADVENTURE
1,Poor Excuse For A Game,"This game lacks a lot, and too much for it to be fun. The play control is horrendous, you can barely move your guy around. And multiplayer isn't that great either, the camera is WAY to far back, I had trouble seeing where my guy was. I would definitely not recommend this cd, but I will comment that 3DO did have a good idea, but I've had better."
1,pretty fun,"This is a good story line and concept, however, I found the game to have low playability. This game will not take the place of 007. Gig'em Ags, Class of 99"
1,A criminal act,"To like this game means you know nothing about video games and should be killed. this sloppy, poor playing game is a crime against humanity. think of talented people who make good games, then think about how you gave this game a good review and should be killed."
3,Play Control Problems,"This game was okay.The coolest thing about it were the levels like the bathroom that were in a house.The other levels were boring.I also like multiplayer,which is the best part of most shooters.The bad thing was the play control.You will have to make tough jumps from angles sometimes.Also the challenge is more of shooting guys than completing the objectives,because they stick a big X on the map that tells you exactly where to go.Rent it first"
3,"Fun, but bad controll makes it frusterating","This game would've and could've been a lot better but that darn N64 controll stick makes it really hard to controll. In the kitchen I tried to jump on a can to get to a higher area, but the controll stick just don't help, makes it extremely hard. The game is fun, but the control pad is way better. Then off course, the multiplayer, well that is horrid. Yup, horrid. For it is way to addictive. Yup, an hour went by to fast. I wouldn't recomend this game to someone who doesn't have a lot of time."
3,Shoot em'up,Army Men is a fun game but it has a little to much shooting and killing for me. Its multi player is a lot like Goldeneyes but I don't realy get the one player. If you like shooting and killing this is a great game for you but if you don't stay away.
2,not as good as the computer game.,This game is not as good as it looks at all i think that this game was very hard at first even though i had a Game Shark! So for this game i dont think you will like it because it will get boring after a couple days with it. The game has some no violence except some of the men run around on fire if you use the flame thrower. The game has poor graphics and the computer game might have more violence but is much easyer and has alot more things to it. The kids might like it because im a teen and might not like it but it is a pretty hard game so you might have alot of trouble and alot of glitches
5,"Fantastic Book, Inspiring Truths that never die","Great book, I downloaded to my kindle. I'm a big fan of bio's on real estate developers and value investors. Shelby Sr and Jr are incredible models to follow and the book goes into their methodology. Like all great investors, they adhere to a strict value investor model like Graham, Buffett, Klarman, Greenblatt and others. I am really inspired by Davis (Sr) and love the principles he preached and lived. What a role model, I can relate as if I knew the man. My grandfather would always say, ""You need to save that money"" and towards the end of his life, he would say, ""You need to invest that money."" I can imagine Davis (Sr) saying the second part. This is both entertaining and full of wisdom. High marks!!!"
1,Difficult to Use,"Maybe if you use these all of the time, you'd get better results. But if you are an occasional do-it-yourselfer and want to KNOW you have found the stud, and not just THINK you have, this product doesn't do the job."
5,guitar + vocal heaven,"This is a miracle of collaboration between the composers, Baden-Powell & DeMoraes, the arranger Paulo Bellinati, and the performers, Bellinati (guitar) and Monica Salmaso (voice). The Afro-Sambas are justly famous, songs created by Baden Powell, inspired by the voodoo music of northern Brazil. Baden Powell recorded two different versions, The Tamba Four jazz group, led by the astonishing pianist Luis Eca, recorded many of them on their album ""We and the Sea."" And there have been other versions also.But no one ever anticipated that Paulo Bellinati, one of Brazil's great classical guitarists, would arrange the Afro-Sambas for only guitar and voice. I have many other guitar/voice duet albums, such as Enrique Coria & Yolanda Aranda and Narciso Yepes & Teresa Berganza. These are brilliant and worth any effort to acquire, but this version of the Afro-Sambas is the best such effort I know of. Buy it. You won't regret it."
1,Afro-Sambas,"This was just a collection of slow ballads. It had none of the rhythm and sounds of a samba, or africa influence. Didn't like it at all. Can't move to it, it's lame."
1,For Christians Only,"I got this book hoping to use it to supplement the journaling part of a workshop I was teaching. I was just looking for some good tips and techniques for creating and maintaining a spiritually-oriented journal. I was sadly disappointed to find that the entire book was focused solely on deepening one's love for God. I'm not even Christian. I tried to glean some tidbits out of it anyway, but page after page was loaded with references to God and Jesus and the Bible. If you're looking for a book about exploring your religion, this is the book for you. If you're looking for a book on spiritual journaling, this is not it."
2,They changed the formula,"This product used to come in a silver metal cylindrical canister and had a thicker, waxier consistency; not to mention worked great. Now it's in a red rectangular plastic container, has a thinner texture, and smells different. Functionality is still ok, but it was much better before they changed it."
3,Loud! Loud! LOUD!!!,"Grindcore: 85 Minutes of Brutal Heavy Metal (director unknown, date unknown [early 90s?], DVD release 2003)I've been having an argument on and off with an associate of mine for over a decade as to whether Godflesh were a grindcore band or not. Well, I finally have the proof I need, in the form of an old Hard 'n Heavy video magazine that found its way to a DVD release in 2003. While it focuses on bands that were more ""classic"" grindcore (Napalm Death and the like), there's Justin Broadrick belting out ""Christbait Rising"".As has been said before, if you're looking for an introduction to or a history of the genre, this is not the release for you; this was made for existing fans of the genre during (or just before) its heyday. Preaching to the choir, as it were, and as a result it probably has more value now than it did back then on nostalgia alone. If you were there, you want to pick this one up. ***"
2,"Easy to Read, Easy to Forget",I was 2/3rd's of the way through this book and realized that nothing was going on. Two very self absorbed brothers make amends while each maintaining their own opposing views. I guess I was disappointed to say the least. The ending was very anticlimactic.
1,911! Emergency! Book in a permanent vegetative state!,"Can we regrow damaged organs in the body without surgery? How can we reconcile the great moral dilemmas? Can we be trusted to play God? Can I be bothered to turn the page?This book for me highlighted the worst of popular speculative fiction. Bova is a man with a story inside, fighting to get out. Can he liberate it and survive? Only by draining it of originality, bleeding it of the philosophy he pretends to explore and transplanting the characters from cardboard cut-outs 'R' us. By all means write a book on this intriguing subject, but not this book.Weak, shallow and sentimental. Would work very well on daytime TV."
3,Dressing,Dressing was a little bland tasting. For a good cause but was not impressed with the taste.
4,Fine Dining,If one were to buy this album unknowingly by the bands name they would possibly be dissapointed. No this group is not a remake of a 70's soul group. They are however an interseting alternative band that will most likely never last in the market they have chosen. None of the songs are really all that distinctive but at the same time they are all hypnotically interesting in their own way. The vocals are destinctive and do not overpower the music. Basically this is going to be an album that you may not scream about on first listen but it will grow on you after repeated listens. It's not pop fodder and as stated earlier will most likely be above alot of listeners heads that seek instant gratification.
4,The perfect weight gainer,I wanted to try some weight gainer and eventually tried this one because of the reputation of ON.I must say that this is the perfect weight gainer and this WILL show you quick results !!!!
1,cheap!,During the first week of use the velcro on the back of the cell phone case ripped. The cord to the earbud is way too short. You have to have the phone very near you otherwise you'll end up pulling the earbud out of your ear. You can't charge the phone and have the earbud plugged in at the same time either! Overall a crappy product.
1,Headset unusable b/c of interference and distortion,"I thought I'd get by with this cheap starter kit, but I primarily wanted it for the headset and almost immediately found it unusable. While I can hear the other party to a call clearly, everyone I talk to using the headset says they get a lot of interference and cannot stand to talk to me while I'm using the headset. If I unplug it and use the phone normally, then the interference clears up, so I do not believe it's a reception-related problem.Also, as other reviewers mentioned, the cord on the headset is far too short. You can't even have the phone at your waist and have the earbud comfortably reach. This time going cheap was an expensive mistake."
1,Piece of crap,"I bought this kit primarily for the hands-free head-set. It seemed to work fine, but was so cheaply made that it broke within a month of use."
1,Twaddly,"I had high hopes for this book based on the reviews, but now that it has arrived it is going right back. This book tells only a single story about Nicholas: the story of the dowries. But even for that story, the characterization shows no depth and the plot contains few details. The Wikipedia entry for St. Nicholas contains much more detail about the story of the dowries than this book does! The sketchy story is padded by frequent repetition of the gospel message, which is admirable but cannot sustain the book alone."
2,very small board book,this is a very small board book. The story is also not what I thought it was going to be.
5,great story to know,the pictures and storytelling are great even for a young child to learn of the story that led later into the one many now celebrate as Santa Claus. This inspirational story helps our daughter see the generosity and compassion behind the cultural tradition.
2,Not quite what I expected...,"When I ordered this book I did not notice that the publisher was Concordia, which is Lutheran. As a Catholic, I was disappointed that St. Nicholas was so ""Protestantized"" and presented as if he was a pastor of some generic church rather than a Catholic bishop! This fact was lost on my young kids of course, and they did enjoy the story, but it annoyed my older kids who were listening in. I just wanted to put that out there for any other Catholics that might be considering buying this book for their children to be aware of the rather non-Catholic presentation."
5,Engrossing,"If you pick up this book, Melody of my life, you will be glad you did.Ms. Banks life journey to date is not only a personal revelation but cherish memories of her daily life. She paints her life struggles and triumphs with keen sense of responsibilities and stunning illustrations like a master artist. She got my full and undivided attention from the beginning to the end of the book. Likewise, she will get yours."
4,The eseential Broadway Baby performer,"Wonderful performer. Excellent choice of varied, exciting, musical material.Anyone who loves Broadway musicals of the golden age would like it."
4,Insight into Japan and Korea's Historical Relationship.,"Jon and Alan Covell present evidence of Korea's influence on ancient Japan in a way that is easy to understand. Japan, an economic power today has always denied historical influnce Korean culture has had on its culture. It has even halted archeological excavations on ancient tombs because of the unwanted reality they may provide.Covell provides some key evidence which provides strong support for the penninsular influence on Japan. Covell organizes the book in a chronological fashion which allows for easy reading. The book also contains many photographs, maps and other visual information to supplement the reading.If you are interested in East Asian history and have an open mind, this book may prove to be very interesting. If you are not convinced by Corvell concerning the influence of Korea on ancient Japan, the authors at least bring a different perspective to Japan's cultural connection with the continent."
2,full of perceptual cues,"Isn't it usual to think that Chinese culture rather than Korean culture influenced the ancient Japanese culture? I found no good proofs to support the opinions of the history fiction writer. It is better to read this book unbelievingly. I also recommend to read ""Korea and Her Neighbours"" written by Isabella Bird, English traveler and writer, first woman member of the Royal Geographical Society."
4,Very nice,This is a nice little story. Our grandson paid close attention the first dozen or so times he read through it.
1,pass the vomit bag,"this is bad. beyond bad.lyrics are childish, music is the equivalent of cheez whiz: processed. she's ugly, too."
3,"interesting.....thoughts, here are mine.","OK. I truely do agree that she does come off as an Avril Lavigne rip-off. But for the target media group then this makes sense. Think about it. You said it yourselves. I like ""Billy S."" I will admit, as well as her song ""Tangled"" they're cute for what they are. I am 19 years old. Sometimes it's fun to listen to this kind of music, it personally just makes me giddy, and reminds me of when I was a few years younger, and just starting to grow up. And I can say I am grown up, I have 2 jobs, and live on my own / support. But music like this should bring out the kid in you. And no music is trash. Everyone has their own opinions of what is ""awesome"" and what should have never left the garage. But HEY... they have a record contract.. none of us do.. so who's doing better here...??"
1,Poor girl.,"This song is quite possibly the worst song I've heard in the last 5 years. Now, I'll give Skye credit- she has a good voice. And after viewing the video, it's obvious she possesses a certain charisma; a definite star quality which makes me curious to hear what else she could come up with. I'm actually anxious to hear her surely ""spunky"" debut. But this song is vapid, boring, and completely predictable. A tale of G-rated ""rebellion"", the track describes the feeling of not wanting to go to school and ""feel for once what it's like to rebel now"". But in this day and age, the innocent, sugary lyrics sound tacky and contrived. It's by-the-numbers, focus group bad-assness, with a typical pop/rock beat that could have been produced by the Matrix. Don't waste your money on this short piece of musical trash."
1,Pure Garbage,"Only reason I gave it a one is because that is the lowest the rating would go. I don't know what the people who gave it glowing reviews was smoking but I need some of that. Sorry, scratch that. If it makes me like crap like this then I don't need it.How could Paul Sorvino even want to be associated with or even star in this movie? It is the worst possible tripe that ever got put on film. If you really, really, REALLY hate someone then give them this movie. Other than that I say pass on it and spend your money on something worth spending your money on. If you like this movie then please, go shoot yourself in the head and end your miserable existence."
1,Horrendous Dreck!,"Wow! How any human being could rate this film a 4 or 5 is absolutely beyond me. There is nothing good here at all. The music drones on and on in your ears with lyrics that neither work as song (no rhyming schemes or rhythmic patterns are used at all), or as storytelling devices usually used to move the plot forward. The visuals are about as backyard as any low-budget student film, and the direction almost non-existent.The story itself is repugnant featuring many scenes of human-beings being disemboweled for entertainment (this is all shown in graphic detail), and lyrics about cutting holes in woman to have sex with them.No decent person with any heart at all could derive enjoyment from garbage like this. How this film got an R-Rating instead of an NC-17 also escapes logic.I wouldn't have even given it a single star except Amazon's rating system demands at least a one star for a review.Avoid at all costs."
1,"oh please people, i beg of you.....","i went and saw this film in philly. we mocked and ridiculed it the whole way through. well, and the goth wanna be's that were there. its just not for everyone i suppose. the music is kinda...fun? i dunno, for a laugh, rent it. but please stop giving it 5 stars. its just a gory, violent, wanna be ""Rocky Horror"". and it NO ""Rocky Horror""!"
5,Strange but wonderful,"Someone mentioned this project to me before it was released and I thought, wow that sounds so strange. But having seen the movie several times, once in a theater filled with screaming fans, I can now saw that it is indeed strange, but also so original and entertaining. It's easily the most unique entity I've come across in a very long time. This movie is not for everyone, but if you are a fan of Sweeney Todd, Rocky Horror, or any other musicals with a harder edge, than get ready to become obsessed with Repo. If you think you might be interested in Repo, than you are and you will instantly become a fan upon seeing it. More to the point: buy this DVD and help fund a sequel!!"
2,A massive disappointment.,"I was really excited to see this movie, and I was incredibly let down. It was a great concept with miserably bad execution. The writing was awful, and the movie was full of so many scenes that should be cool, but somehow weren't cool at all. The majority of the singing was awkward and halfhearted and the music had virtually no musicality.I give it one star for some impressive visuals, and one more just for ""Zydrate Anatomy"", which even I'll admit is pretty fantastic. There would be another half star for actually managing to make Paris Hilton look attractive, but it's cancelled out by that awful song ""Seventeen"" that would have been alright if it weren't so completely out of place in the movie.If you do want to see it, I urge you to rent it before you buy it."
5,It's the 21st Century Cure!,"This is a great movie (even if Paris Hilton is in it =P), for a great price, it arrived fast, shrink wrapped, and sealed! A+ Recommend!"
2,No Cult Film Status Here.,"I do not feel that this movie deserves the title of cult film status. This movie does not connect. The only half way good scene is the Brightman solo. Sorry, we are still waiting for a Rock Opera."
4,Not for everyone.,"Watched the Blu-Ray special and it tells you how this movie came about from a ten minute stage show. Its different and some songs are catchy, some songs are not great but needed for the story. Great voices, even Paris Hilton did a good job. Sarah Brightman knocked it out the park. Basically its a Saw meets an opera. Movie has great style. Not for everyone but if you appreciate art direction, this might be for you."
3,dark musicals need work,"The imagery and ambiance was wonderful but the music left me disappointed. With so many great musicians all in one film, I guess I expected more, but they still don't seem to know how to make ""dark"" musicals sound good rather than cheesy."
5,Amazing and memorable!,"The first time I saw the trailer of this movie I thought this is interesting. But when I got the opportunity to watch it. It blow my mind. Amazing visual FX, the cast is very cool and they characters are very memorable. Even I was impressed with Paris Hilton in this movies, because in some scenes her acting and singing look really nice done.I congratulate Twister Picture for this great effort that catch my attention with the amazing work of the costumer design and the set are Gothic and memorable. The music is fantastic, a mix of opera and rock that draw you into the dark and twister world of Repo."
4,Strangely appealing...,"When I first stumbled upon hearing about ""REPO!,"" I didn't think much of it. But I did a bit of research on it, and heard ""Zydrate Anatomy"" for the first time, and I was hooked. I didn't think it was ""my type"" of thing, but I was almost instantly drawn to it. The music is rather catchy, and the cast is quite diverse--but they all come together in a unique, collaborative style (yes, even Paris Hilton is surprisingly good). It seems to be either a hit-or-miss for a lot of people... My only suggestion: if it seems somewhat interesting to you, just give it a chance."
5,Giles as a killer!,"Originally I bought this because it blends with my Buffy addiction quite well. I was unprepared for just how incredible the movie would actually be, and the music is incredible. Very easy to see why this is such a cult classic!"
1,Deeply boring and pretentious.,"This is a good example of an awesome premise that was doomed to fail. Despite the great cast, the music was boring and repetitive and trite. The filming was dark for the sake of being dark. After ten minutes I started wondering when it would be over.This is a terrible terrible movie."
1,Awful,When i heard about this movie I was pretty psyched. A movie about a company that repossesses organs sounded too good to be true. Then when I heard it was also a rock opera I knew I had to see this movie. After watching it I was amazed at how bored I was. The movie was not exciting in the least. The music was obnoxious. The acting was poor. The gore wasn't even good.
1,Too Bad,"Unfortunately, there are no positive parts in this movie:a)the music is very weak, no lyricism, no poetry, even in the more dramatic moments;b)the plot had really some potential, as other reviewers pointed out, but it was developed with extreme bad taste;c)the bloody scenes, that appear frequently along the movie, could be acceptable if handed with humor, but that never happens: the movie is not funny at all;d)the singers really try to do a good work, but their performances cannot improve the negative points that permeate almost all parts of the movie."
1,In Decline,"One interesting thing about societies in decline is that their members are the last to know. Is ""Repo"", artistic, creative, intelligent, even entertaining? If you think so then, well then, good luck. Song and musical quality not even in the same Earth (ball park) as ""Rocky"" or ""Phantom""; maybe a grade school musical. CGI was cheaply flat/static with little depth or detail. Special effects - e.g. the plastic sheeting used in walk-in freezers; typical blood filled syn skin prosthetics. Acting? Best exemplified by the dialogue - short or non-existent (don't want to make it too challenging). On the positive side there is some merit to the story line."
1,POS,Holy G-d in heaven! This really takes the cake on the worst movies I have ever watched thus far. Everyone involved in this movie needs to be horse whipped. I only watched it all the way through BECAUSE it was so bad to begin with.
1,UTTER GARBAGE,What else can be said? My mind recoils from this artless disease of a movie. It should come with a free stick for gagging yourself. Even better a blindfold and earplugs. Save yourself the pain and avoid.
1,Couldn't make it past 20 minutes,"which I realize limits the value of a review, so I'll be brief: uninspired. Lazily written music/lyrics. Characters who are already boring. Save your time."
2,Quite what I expected...,"Well, I wasn't waiting much from this movie but since I'm a die hard fan of Sarah Brightman I decided to buy and watch it anyway. I got disappointed with the music, which is a bit repetitive, but the lyrics and the photography of this movie are really god. In my opinion they were a bit over the top with all the gore and the action isn't what would make you stay awake to whatch but, it was what I expected. Really nice ideas wrapped together without much thought..."
5,I want to watch this movie over and over!,"Most of the negative reviews I've read on this movie are directed at the musical score, in that it was put together by amateurs and sounds it. I have to agree that the score is a little rough, but the failing is not one that anyone but an opera snob would really notice. Most of the songs are better than anything you'd hear on the radio and as good as anything Andrew Lloyd ""I stole it from Pink Floyd"" Weber would throw together.Really, the concept is so solid that the songs could be entirely made up of cats in heat screeching and you would still want to see it at least once. And then twice. Maybe half a dozen times...this week."
4,Hot and Original,"It's a rock musical. It's dark, morbid, and not for kids.Unexpectedly Good Points:Paris Hilton can sing really well.HotThe most original thing since... Dr.Horrible, I'd bet. Nothing alike.Random funny moments.Bad Points:There are practically 0 non-sung lines (maybe five through-out the movie)The whole 17 bit was a bit...off-key from the rest of the movie.Not enough Grave robber. He has an amazing voice."
5,My husband and I loved it!,My little sister and mom liked it too. I'm really glad we went ahead and bought this movie when we could! It's worth it!
5,The best Gothic Opera Ever!,"We got Repo in addition to other movies for its 'schlock horror' aspects. We were amazed at the content, the blood soaked high camp gore fest with some amazingly sensitively photographed scenes and great dialogue (monologue?)Any way, if you're into Goth/slasher/comedy/opera, this one will sing for you!"
2,"Great Video Quality, OK Content Quality","OUR STORY:So the story is something that actually sounded rather ingenious, and something that someone who's into fringe sci-fi would find quite appealing, which of course, I did. My wife loves musicals, and rock for that matter, and so between the two of us, we'd thought that we'd found something that could appeal to the both of us. It had a reasonably good looking cast, and our local 'fringe' movie house had it playing and was sold out every time! All in all, it sounded better than it ended up being.VIDEO QUALITY:Who ever mastered this blu-ray did an excellent job, it's gorgeous, and the sound's pretty good too!!YOU SHOULD BUY IT IF:You like rock operas, while it wasn't what we expected, and it's nothing that I'd suggest anyone ran out and bought, for the price, if you like this kind of movie, it's probably a good buy for you. The other reviews all sing its' praises. I feel that if you're not into it, you won't change your mind :)"
2,Disappointed,"Heard many good things about this, enough to buy it. Disappointed to say the least. Performances were actually very good, visually nicely done, but expected much better music in a musical which kind of ruined it for me."
5,Fantastic Film,A brilliant film. another rock opera to top the rest. Repo is a wonderful involved tribute to traditional operas with a new twist.
2,"Being a Sarah Brightman fan, not what I expected.","Being a Sarah Brightman fan, it was not at all what I expected. I started watching the video and disappointed. Also the music is too ""new"" for me. But we all have to try something new from time to time."
2,Missed the mark...,"This movie could have been great...great idea! However, the missed the mark. They should have looked at what made the Rocky Horror Picture so great. First of all, they sang every single word, which makes it boring. The movie is too gruesome in parts, and this was unnessary. Finally, the sets were unrealistic looking. Again, the premise was great, but they just missed the mark.I loved seeing Joan Jett in the movie, except her facial expression was a little bogus. She tried too hard to look tough.I really thought many of the singers were talented and thought Paris Hilton did a good job."
5,Repo! The Genetic Opera,"Repo! The Genetic Opera is as crazy a mix as it sounds. It truly is an opera, albeit a rock opera, about the practice of organ repossession in the near future. It's one part Phantom, one part Rocky Horror, and all a bio. nerd could ask for!"
3,Repo--interesting,"The rreason I bought it was because Sarah Brightman played Blind Meg in it.I found the story line good and rather engrossing, but I didn't like the graphic inserts. To me they detracted from the story and added nothing to the plot. I thought the singing excellent. It alone made the purchase worth while.The acting was good, though I did find Paris tather over the top. She didn't seem comfortable using the f-word, which her character did a lot.I'm glad I bought it, just as a sort of curious example of horror movies.Jane Gaschke"
1,Nice Try,"None of the hard work on this film matters when the music is so lousy. The cheapo but colorful visuals are fine, the cast is too. Has so much time passed since good music was written that nobody can tell anymore when something is bad? The Nineties may have killed any ability to judge. Used to be Europe was the source of cruddy ""music"" (- if you think ABBA is bad, for example, listen to what the Swedes were listening to BEFORE they came along! It will actually make you appreciate that band). There are scraps of decent melodies that start here and there in Repo, but they never gel into effective songs. No matter what you think of Sarah Brightman, she can actually sing; too bad they waste her here along with all the rest. And here's yet another U.S. film shot in Canada - will the last U.S. citizen working on an actual U.S. film shoot please turn out the lights?"
1,The presentation falls short of the idea,"I saw this movie in theaters and wanted to like it. I really did. But after watching the whole thing I was left more than disappointed. The idea for it is brilliant, but the execution falls more than short. Horrible songs and actors with little to no talent make this painful to watch. Besides, all of the dialog seems to be written by teenage goths who work at hot topic, and even though they have a good idea they don't understand the concept of story telling so they fail all over the damn thing.It is good for a laugh, but not much else. The idea is there, but it should never have been created as a musical for that is where it fails all over the place."
2,Repo-Genetic Opera,"I bought this because of Sarah Brightman.Unfortunately, she has a relativly small part in the movie.The music is fair, as is the acting.The plot is quite interesting.Other than Sarah, the singing is not that good.Overall, I rate this as Fair."
4,astonishing movie,"the edition of this movie could be better with the extras and maybe some easter eggs, but it's very acceptable considering that the movie is astonishing every single minute of it. The best Anthony Stewart Head's performance ever!"
5,excellent movie,"I love this movie. I'm not a musical kind of girl, but this movie is great. Plenty of gore and enough hot topic attire to excite any 17 year old."
5,AMAZING,"I absolutely love this movie! It is not very well-known and that is surprising to me. It is weird, exciting, and has some awesome songs! It also has a great cast! TOTALLY RECOMMEND"
5,Brilliant,"I borrowed my friend's DVD of Repo!, because he told me it was awesome, and I fell in love with it. I loved the music, rock operas are my favorite. :)The best songs (even though some of them are not on the soundtrack, even the deluxe which made me angry) are:- Shilo Wakes- Legal Assassin- 21st Century Cure- Zydrate Anatomy (I'm a total Z addict :D)- Cut the ties/ Shilo turns on Rotti- Let the monster rise- and Needle through a bugI'm sad to see that a few people didn't like the movie, mainly because they expected something more upbeat and happy, but I found that the morbidity made the move amazing. I loved the movie and I'm pleased to say I own the soundtrack and the movie. :)"
5,Amazing!,I love this movie! It's fantastic and it's written by the guy who plays the Graverobber! I think this movie is extremely well made and it's the best Paris Hilton has EVER looked! (Best she ever will unless they do a sequel)
3,Improvement but not a winner!,"The picture is very disceiving. After installation the felt shrinks into the plastic holder so the chairs are still scraping the floors. The upside, its plastic so it does rub off, but there is still work involved!"
5,Great Commentary!,This commentary on Genesis is a good Biblical commentary. I does not subscribe to evolution nor the gap theory but only the Bible.
4,Good book,"These books push a specific dogma that you may or may not agree with, but the overall storytelling is nice. I have enjoyed the first 14 books and continue to read them."
5,Brilliant Bennett,"This superb collection of Alan Bennett includes the marvelous An Englishman Abroad, brilliantly acted by Alan Bates and Coral Brown. This alone is worth the price. The collection also includes wonderful short and long plays full of wit, sophistication and feeling as only Bennett could write them. Recommended without reservation."
4,Alan Bennett Collection,"If you like his Talking Heads videos, this is another one to see. He does the commentary between pieces himself."
1,"The same thing. Over, and over, and over...","The only reason I'm reading this book is for school reading. Otherwise, I would have put it down a long time ago. It's just the author venting about his dislike for technology and how he thinks that it's going to destroy mankind as we know it. I realized that the computer boom has its bad side effects, but Slouka takes it to the extreme, and her repeats the same thing over and over again. I don't find much value in his book except for disagreeing with him. Please, spare yourself."
2,UGH,"this game was plain and simple not meant to be for the playstation. It's graphics are glitchy, gameplay is boring and repetitive and and the game is just plain not very much fun to play"
3,"OK, but short","This game was OK. The spells were good and the weapon enhancements were a pretty cool idea. While it was possible to do different moves with the shield and weapons to make combos of a sort, it ended up being easier to just block the enemies' 2 attacks and attack, block and attack. It is very repetitive.Perhaps I've been spoiled with RPG games lately, but the character interaction in this game seemed so limited that it brought the entire game down. The entire game was very small and I got through it in about 3 sittings. The best thing going for the game was the voice acting. The storyline was limited by the very small character interaction. Also, I couldn't help feeling like I was playing a bad version of Soul Reaver the whole time. That, or a mediocre clone of King's Field, which was mediocre in its own right.If you find this for cheap, it may be worth it, but don't be expecting amazing graphics and sound."
1,Waste of time and money..........,"I have always been a fan of the M&M series. Every game that I have played seemed to involve you into the story. This game on the other hand for Playstation was a total waste of time and money. The game last about 4 hours, that is even if you aren't very good a role playing games. The graphics need to be improved, and the voices of the characters are a total joke. ......."
2,"this game is ok,but it could be better","I thought that this game was pretty cool during the first three levels, but after that things really went down hill. I also thought that it got too difficult too fast. The first three levels were extremely easy, then i got to level four and it took me like three hours to beat. It seemed like the enemies got tougher and Drake stayed the same. Although, I am new to the RPG scene, so maybe it's just me."
2,"tough to play, bad ending",There wasn't enough choice in direction for the game and became extremely to almost impossible to finish levels as you went. Not enough magic choice and the system of obtaining magical items was also near to impossible and gave very little reward in return.
3,It's a good product,"It's good for testing HDMI cables it is very simple if the light is on the connection is good, if not the cable is bad."
3,Not good for a short person,"I'm only giving this product an ""ok"" review as I don't think it's totally awful. I just want to warn other short people may not be able to easily use this product as a taller person. The door lock sits on top of the door and if you are short and if you live in a newer house with taller doors, you will find that you have to pull a stool up each and every time to open and close the door. Not good."
1,Doesn't fit my door either.,"Same problem I had as other reviewer, There are wider versions that work great but this one is not it."
2,Not secure enough - too short,"I have 3 bi-fold doors in the basement I wanted to keep locked so I tried this one first since it was cheapest. It fits the door, but it is not long enough to be very effective. A moderate tug was enough to make it pop off the top of the door. I ordered the KidCo bi-fold door lock next after not being satisfied with this one and it works much better. I have since ordered 2 more of the KidCo locks and will likely throw this one out as it was too cheap to even bother with returning it.2 stars since it does what it says it will do, just not well enough for me to trust it to prevent my kids from getting into the utility closet."
1,Worked for a day,This worked for 1 day before my two year old got past it. Would not recommend at all. Save your money
1,Barely Within Spec & Still Doesn't Work,"This product doesn't fit my wooden doors even though the doors are (barely) within the 1.125"" width specified on the package."
2,Not big enough,"This item probably works well for thin bi-fold doors; but, if your bi-folds are near or at standard door widths, this product will not open wide enough to work properly for your doors."
5,Bifold Locks are great toddler stoppers,"My 2 year old like rearranging our pantry, but not anymore. You got o get these."
1,Doesn't Work,I had something similar when my older children were little and I loved them. I had hunted high and low for a similar product for my toddler and finally found this product. It barely fit over the top of the closet door and sprung off when my son tried to open the door causing him to fly across the room and dent the wall. I'm glad it didn't hit anyone. I'm not sure what is different about these particular locks but they don't work.
1,Child proof if your kids aren't mobile yet.,"Let me start by saying my two year old is very curious and into everything. We took the knobs off of her closet door and put these on the top. It was a deterrent for a day. On day 2 she stuck her fingers under the door, pulled and this lock popped off the top of the door. It scratched the door up pretty good. She got in the closet within 5 minutes of her bed time. They do not slide well, they seem to get snagged between the door folds and rub off the finish. The second one shattered when she pulled on the door thus leaving sharp pieces of plastic for my 2 year old to play with. I ended up taking everything out of her ""locked closet"" that I did not want her to eat, rip, break, or ruin and left them unlocked.Pros: They are cheap and adjustable by simply turning the knob to tighten it to fit most bifold doors."
1,Not Worth It......,"This lock is not worth anything it is cheaply made, yes it was easy to put up but no it did not do its job spend a few more dollars and get one that is better than this."
2,There are better products for this purpose,"This product was not a good fit for my metal closet doors - not to mention it was hard to reach that high. If it of lower doors, or thicker doors might work for you, but for metal closet doors try ""Mommy's Helper Slide-Lok Bi-Fold Door Lock"""
1,Don't waste you money,Even when installed correctly and tighten down it did nothing to keep my 2 year old out of his closet. All he had to do was pull a little harder and it bent and popped right off.
3,So-so,"I have a little two year old Houdini who figures out how to escape out of anywhere and can get into everything, no matter how much I child-proof. We purchased this so he would stop getting into his closet when he was meant to be taking a nap. I was disappointed that the doors of his closet where too thick for this, so make sure that you measure thickness before you purchase. We actually had to end up disassembling it and using only the outside part of it without the knob. It still does the trick, as it is too high for the little one to move."
1,Garbage,These locks popped right open just enough for my toddler to still get his finger in the door crack and smash it. Every time I screwed the lock down tight the same thing would still happen. It's junk.
4,These work great!,"These were pre-installed on our kitchen pantry when we bought our house. They are easy to slide back and forth and work great keeping my kiddos out of the pantry! I knocked off one star because I think tiny fingers could still get pinched. It hasn't happened at our house, but I tested it and my finger does fit. However, our slide rail is a little bent so that could contribute to the looseness."
2,string too long,The strings on this were too long. You would need to weigh close to 200 pounds in order to wear this. I weigh less than 130. I may cut the strings and re-sew it to make it wearable.
1,THERE IS NO SUCH RELEASE,"ATTENTION: This CD does not exist!! It has been listed for several years at many major online music retailers, but it did not ever get released. Apparently it was announced at some point, and was clearly even given an ASIN # (see above), which amazes me. Vermiform Records is no longer putting out new material, and there has yet to be any official re-release of the Neanderthal tracks. A real mystery as to how this listing was ever established..."
2,Its ok,"This pillow is all right, but it is a bit too soft. It also hardly has any height and with the softness, if you sleep on your side you end up sleeping with your neck angled downwards. I have woken up with a headache a few times because of this. I paired it with another pillow in order to make it higher and little but firmer, but it still isn't the best it could be. I would pay more and get a higher density pillow. Of course this type of product is something that depends upon the preferences of the person using it. It just didn't work for me as well as I thought it would."
4,Comfortable pillow,I like this pillow with memory foam. So does my neck. The only problem is it is a little small. Sometimes I just rolled out of it.
1,Different Item from last year,"I bought 2 of these in 2007 and they were fantastic. Decided to buy 2 more a year later (2008), but the pillows were considerably smaller and softer. I thought they sent me a different model, but the code was the same.I had to wash my older ones and keep using them. Good thing is the older ones keep their shape."
4,comfortable but thin,"A decent ""budget"" memory foam pillow, but on the thin side. It's lightweight, and other than for back sleeping, is uncomfortable by itself: eg, I can't sleep on my side comfortably on it.So then how did it rate 4 stars? It works VERY well layered with a down pillow, providing a pliable bottom layer. For a bottom pillow, poly-fill is be too hard, a down pillow on the bottom gets lumpy and slides out. Non-ideal. A down-filled pillow on top of this thin contour is just right, the contour holds it in place, the down adds some malleability and thickness.This contour pillow is also light enough I'd consider traveling with it; I've been looking for a pillow suitable to take on trips, since hotels always seem to have the most awfully uncomfortable poly-fill pillows."
1,used pillow,I bought this from amazon and It looks like i received a used pillow. The tag is removed and there is some foam missing from the side of the pillow. Be-careful
2,put in spare bedroom,The product was not comfortable; it is now in the spare bedroom for unwanted guests. Also perspired even with 2 cotton pillowcases.
4,Camp is campy,"I had seen the movie previous to ordering this soundtrack. The movie and the music is well preformed and interesting. The story line is the usual but with a twist. One of the main characters is facing coming to grips with his own sexuality and family dynamic. All in all, it is an interesting storyline."
4,"enjoy the movie, LOVE THE MUSIC","The movie was great, and the soundtrack is spectacular. ""Here's where I stand"" and ""How Shall I See You Through My Tears"" are two of my personal favorites, filled with emotion that is way beyond the years of these young singers. The CD takes you on a journey of fun, happiness, sadness and many other emotions and is definitely worth the purchase."
4,I'm Still Singing These Songs . . .,"I fell in love with ""Camp"" on DVD and subsequently bought the soundtrack. Without the visual part of the film, I get to concentrate even more on how amazing the voices of the cast are. I don't really know why any of the tracks past eight are included--I haven't listened to one of them.My Favorites:1. ""How Shall I See You through My Tears""3. ""Here's Where I Stand""5. ""Want of a Nail""7. ""Ladies Who Lunch""8. ""Turkey Lurkey Time"""
3,Century Plant,"If you like this album I strongly suggest that you get a copy of ""Loose"" by Victoria Williams, which has the definitive original version of ""Century Plant,"" the quite beautiful song that's given a full-bore, ""American-Idols"" pop choral version in this film and on this soundtrack."
5,Awesome!,"Saw the movie, got the cd, and itstill blew me away!! I crank it upand let the feelings just pour out ofthe speakers like water rushingfrom hoover dam... Rich, and full,this shows you what you can do whenyou put your soul into a project...Awesome!"
5,Paul Goodwin's interpretation the best,"Paul's arrangement of this masterpiece is clearly ""the best"". I wish it was available on dvd as the theatrical part adds a lot to the total enjoyment. I have seen it performed on tv and it is outstanding."
3,94-95 GM owners read carefully.,"I bought this scan tool to read the codes on my 1995 Corvette, which is an odd year for GM where some of their vehicles were transitioning from OBD I to OBD II. I bought this scan tool because it said it was compatable with my car and sounded like I would not need to purchase any accessories to make it work.Once I recieved the scan tool and opened it up I realized that there was no cable that would work with my car! The mystereious fifth cable is even shown in the manual along with the other four that were included. After calling the manufacture's tech support I found that this cable was not missing, but rather that I would have to buy it seperately.In the end this was not as good of deal for me as the Actron kit (which seems to be the same company). At least once I did receive the extra cable it worked and even tells you what the code means, not just a number."
2,Basic functions only,A good tool with basic error code readout for OBD1 equipped vehicles. I haven't used it on OBDII vehicle yet. Interface is a little funky having to re-enter vehicle name each time you scan it. You have to buy a serial or USB cable to hook to your computer (added expense and should have been included in the kit). Software that came with the kit is primative and doesn't include any code database for OBD1 vehicles. Even though I got it at substantially less than retail it's still over priced. IMHO
4,great purchase,this was a great purchase since I Got about 30.00 with my new amazon visa.this is a updated version of what i had and it seams to be good. Thanks
5,Beautiful,"(This rating is based upon the dvd Noí Albinoí, released in Iceland.)This movie is wonderfully subtle, dark and beautiful. The opening scene is amazing. Dagur Kári has definitely done an incredible job.I did not realize this film's international potential when I was visiting Iceland last summer and i picked this movie up, but i was amazed at how stunning the flick is. It's not so surprising that, after 101 Reykjavík, more attention is paid to iceland's limited film industry.I will also have to say that the soundtrack is excellent! Pick that up as well if you like Iron and Wine or 'Bonnie Prince Billy'."
3,"Interesting, but too much in love with its own quirkiness","This film from Iceland is about a 17-year old Albino called Noi (played by an actor who doesn't look either like an albino or a 17 year old) living on an oppresively dull small town in an isolated fjord. Noi, meanwhile, has problems in school, has problems with his parents, hangs out in a bookstore (the town's only, presumably) owned by a cranky old man and is in love with the beautiful waitress of the bar in the gas station. The movie itself is sort of interesting, has droll humor to spare, but at the end, seems to be too much in love with its own quirkiness. And, what should we make of the fact that (SPOILER ALERT: DON'T READ THIS IF YOU HAVEN'T YET SEEN THE MOVIE AND PLAN TO WATCH IT) most of the people Noi cares for die at the end as a result of an avalanche."
1,"Cold dreary landscape and bleak, boring and slow story","This 2003 Icelandic film is about a 17-year old boy who happens to be an Albino, and who leads a bleak life. The town is small. The landscape is cold and dreary. And everybody seems unhappy.Noi lives with his grandmother. His alcoholic father lives nearby. School bores him and he falls asleep in class. But yet, when a school psychiatrist tries to interview him, Noi plays with a Rubik Cube and solves the puzzle in a very short time.Noi meets a girl. of course. and they plan on running away together.I'm not sure how the film ended though because the bleakness and the boredom of life in the little Icelandic town made me fall asleep and miss the last 20 minutes. When I woke up, I had no interest in watching the end.This film wins the prize as being the most boring and slow that I've ever seen."
1,Terrible,The product arrived in a brown envelope without a return address. One of the plastic containers was broken and the disc was missing. The other three are formatted for IBM compatibles and do not work in our computer. Please credit my VISA $98.94.The product was not what I wanted. I wanted three iomega zip drive100mb for my pc. I did notwant them formatted for IBM compatibles. I see that I ordered three and one was missing. The plastic case was there but broken open. I will send back the two zip drives in the same 9 1/2 by 121/2 inch envelope they came in but I don't know where to mail them. Please credit my VISA $98.94.
1,3 out of 4 = 1,"If this CD had material which had not been previously released, I could have given it a higher rating. However, I have two major problems with these cuts. First of all, Its hard to appreciate songs from Charlotte's first CD because she is almost 17 now so its hard to make allowances for faults on her songs sung at age 12. However, her 4th album and some ""bonus tracks"" made at the same time are really bad as her voice has faded and she sounds no better than my wife. So there is nothing here, which anyone who has been around for awhile, would find enticing.So even though her first 3 albums got OK marks, this one must get a D- or an F."
2,Going in Reverse,"I thought that the 5 songs from Miss Church's first CD were the highlight of this GH album. However, unlike her looks, her voice gets worse as she gets older. You will be better served by considering her first and 2nd albums and leaving this one alone. An album of this type was not a good idea at this stage of her career."
2,Somewhat decent but still mediocre,"I am well aware of Charlotte's age. However, I am also aware of her amazing vocals and powerful range. But these things don't make you a good singer. Charlotte chose to stick to opera in most of her songs. And face it, not just anyone can do opera.Charlotte's voice is very well trained - maybe too trained. From a very young age she's been hitting the same notes as Sarah Brightman. But I feel that Charlotte's over-worked and not to mention overdone voice has been declining tremendously.But I guess none of this really matters now because I haven't heard her do anything classical for a while. If you want to listen to Charlotte now, go find the song 'Crazy Chick.'If you want to listen to other angel voiced sopranos, I'd go with Sarah Brightman or Renee' Fleming."
1,Best of What???????????????,"I've listened to all of the Charlotte Church albums and the selections which have been included in this ""Best Of"" album are worse than any single album she has had out yet. If Charlotte made these selections, then she should find some other line of work because she doesn't know good songs from mediocre and bad. This album will undoubtedly be the worst seller of any of her 5 albums to date. Don't waste your money on Prelude - Its a stinker."
2,Prelude??????????????????????????,"The title of this album appears to be a total contradiction in terms. A prelude is at the beginning. The ""best of"" anything is typically reserved for the end. I can accept a prelude for the songs in this CD as they sound as if she is practicing and developing her voice. She certainly has a long ways to go before being considered a credible singer. She must get more emotion into her voice. She sounds like she is in a recital rather than meaning what she is singing. She is OK for a novice. However, something like this should be given away as a demo as opposed to going for full price. For curiosity seekers only."
2,The Best Has Been Left Out.,"For a girl who had relatively few well sung songs, its a shame that most of those have been left out of this album. Its obvious that the people in her organization and the buying public have differing views."
4,A Rare Opportunity,Its a rare opportunity to be able to obtain an album which contains the best of any artist so soon into her career. This CD will afford you the opportunity to purchase a single CD instead of 4 and hear the best songs from an artist who certainly is considered in a class by herself and still only 16.You may also want to consider a video out concurrently which also compiles the best from her first 4 videos. Charlotte is unique and you certainly would want to check her best out so far on this 18-track compilation.
3,Last half of album is gorgeous,"Charlotte is so very talented for her young age.She has a wonderful gift, but she needs a new producer to protect her and her image. She sings an absolutely gorgeous song from ""A Beautiful Mind"" that haunts me daily. Someone should choose her songs better, because reviews have been so unkind to this young lady.She needds material more suited to her range.How would you like to grow up in front of the world?The Prayer with Josh Groban stands out as her finest vocal performance, she sings this song live with other partners and she is quite a vocalist. Remarkably she does well under pressure, sings live and she remains to me the voice of an angel. I am not crazy about this album, however, I am willing to watch her grow up in front of our eyes.The last half of the album is gorgeous. People.......give her a break! Someday she will show us all. Charlotte....you go girl!"
1,not an intelligent move by her record label,"This CD is not worthwhile of my time, my money, or anyone's time and money for that matter. I don't know why anyone would want to buy this CD---true opera lovers will be appalled by this poor excuse for opera, broadway lovers not be impressed with all the great vocal CDs out there, and I have no idea why any popular music fans would like this music. Ms. Church's voice is by far NOT ready to record a CD---a ""best of"" CD by a mistrained mimicker is quite humorous. Buy this CD if you need a good laugh, but if you want to listen to a singer that actually has talent and will keep your attention, I suggest you look elsewhere."
2,What happened?,"Now I am not by any means a Charlotte Church fan. I think she always had a pretty lousy technique but when she was younger, she at least had a pretty tone and she could hit high notes fairly well. But in the songs here off Enchantment, she sounds almost like an alto! What happened to her voice? I'd always hoped that when she got older, she would get a good voice teacher and train her voice to its full potential. But now it appears that it will never happen. A bit sad, isn't it?"
1,More of the same.,"As others have noted, this CD brings nothing new to the table. The ""new"" songs have the same problem that Enchantment had and that is that she had lost most of her voice when they were recorded. I am very disappointed that something better than this could not have been released after such a disappointment as Enchantment. But maybe this is as good as she will ever be. If so, she needs to look for new musical genres. The ones included herein are not compatible with her voice any longer."
1,Prelude???? To What???,"The title of this album struck me as a contradiction so I thought I would check it out. A more appropriate name would be ""Postcript"" As an artist on the way down and out, I can't imagine what would be next other than a long lay-off to get her voice together. Another problem here is that Charlotte gives us too many songs which are from the most recent period when her voice was just a whisper of what it was as a pre-teen. We needed to hear more from her first two albums when she was something of a wunderkid, belting out big-time vocals with a little body.I see this CD as being coveted by only the most die-hard of Charlotte's fans. It really brings us nothing new and reminds us of what happened to her voice through abuse and overuse."
1,A Prelude to The Best,"I believe that the title of this CD is gramatically incorrect. It should read ""A Prelude To The Best Of Charlotte Church. I say that because what is included in this CD cannot possibly be her best within her entire lifetime. All of the songs are juvenile and child-like renditions. As one reviewer commented, she needs another 10 or so albums before she is ready for a ""Best of"" or ""Greatest Hits"" album. For her age, she sings fine. However, I would not attempt to advertise these works as anything special, because they are not."
1,More Like The Beginning,"This was the first time I had an opportunity to listen to Charlotte Church, however, I did not feel like I was listening to a ""Best Of"" collection; rather, it sounded like a demo which a high school girl was submitting to a record company. Granted, the production values are considerably above the ""demo"" level, but Charlotte's singing is not. Give this a 3/4 as a demo but only a 1 for a Best Of album which she is not ready to produce yet."
1,2nd Rate,"I heard Charlotte sing on TV and it was pretty bad, but sometimes live music can get screwed up by the sound system, so I listened to this album to see if she was really better than that. But the songs here are just as bad. I mean the songs are good but her singing is really juvenile. Maybe when she was 12 it was kind of amazing, but as a full grown girl her singing is strictly 2nd and 3rd rate. She should wait a few years and see if her voice gets better."
5,Great CD!,"This album really does has the best of Charlotte Church, not songs picked out of a hat. It goes in order, showing how much her voice matured over the years. Though I do like all the songs on the album, I wish they would've put ""Carrickfergus"" (Enchantment) and ""Ave Maria"" (from Voice of an Angel) on it. Plus, there are songs never released on any CD.I have the last 4 albums, so I really bought this to hear a few songs I never heard and they're all fabulous. The best one is ""Tantum Ergo"" it's so pretty sounding. I call it my good luck song.I would pay even $100 for this CD just to hear those few songs and Charlotte's best."
4,Not the best but still very good.,"Charlotte Church's voice may be slipping but this cd is still very good. I too would like to see her do less pop music and tune up her vocals a bit. However, she is still better than 95% of the pop artist on the radio. A good cd if you're just looking for a light listen or an introduction to Charlotte Church."
1,horrifying.,"Why would anyone have a prepubescent or teenage girl singing the Habanera? It is for a rather sizeable mezzo soprano who has some life experience to help interpret it. And that's for a reason: it was written for a woman with that particular voice, maturity, and training. Let others assay it at their peril.Similarly could be said for everything she has sung from the opera repertoire.Repertoire has been chosen for this poor child with total disregard for her age, instrument, and training.It's horrifying. Please don't."
5,Best of the Best!,"Okay I admit after hearing Charlotte's ""Enchantment"" I had myself questioning by dedication to Charlotte's talent...people have been asking ""Charlotte what happened to your voice"" so I feel the need to comment...THESE ARE PREVIOUS RECORDINGS...so these are tracks sung by the same twelve year old that amazed and dazzled the pope and ""had the voice of an angel."" So nothing really in this c.d. is really taken after Charlotte's diastrous Enchantment...In fact if you are to get one Charlotte Church c.d. this should be it...It has all of Charlottes best songs on it and is truely my all time favorite Charlotte c.d. So if you want to see what Charl(as she's called by her friends)is all about buy this c.d!"
2,Inadequate Progress,"I've listened to Charlotte since she first began singing and while she appeared to be brilliant at first with Pie Jesu, there has been little, if any progress since that time. In fact, I must agree with some others who note that her voice is not as strong as it once was. Considering she has a voice coach, it is somewhat baffling that her vocal control has not improved. And while her range seems somewhat broader, she appears to be straining to reach the lower notes in Habanera. Bridge Over Troubled Waters also seems very weak and should have been left off of this compilation in favor of some of her earlier numbers.This album simply left me with a bad taste in my mouth about Charlotte's singing career to date. She needs to take some time off and improve before continuing with recorded music."
1,"We Need Feelings, Not Just Notes","When I was first introduced to Charlotte Church via the Classical Showcase Channel, she showed tremendous promise, even though she was singing in essentially two octaves. Reviewing, Prelude, I find that she still can only sing with any authority within that two octave range. In the meantime, her voice is certainly not as strong as it once was. Additionally, she continues to sing as if it were a rehersal, with no emotion, as if she was simply a studio singer for hire. For anyone with an ear for music, her totally structured approach to singing is a turn-off. She needs to begin to feel her music and her audience will begin to feel her. Until then, her songs will remain sterile and unappealing to the patrons of the arts.S. PresserVocal InstructorLos Angeles Academy of Fine Arts"
1,A Terrible Selection,"Charlotte Church has enough of a problem with her failing voice, so that she doesn't need a poor selection of songs to further add to a what has to be one of the worst albums ever released alleging to be the best of an artist. She brings a brilliant Josh Groban into sing The Prayer with her which only shows how inept she is vocally compared to Groban. She also performs Habanera which makes her sound rediculous straining to reach down to an octave well out of her reach. She also leaves Carrickfergus, which was somewhat of a shining star in the black hole which was her previous album, out completely. This album is best left alone."
1,Post-Mortem - Not Prelude,"Based on the selections from this album, it should appropriately be called ""The Last of Charlotte Church"". Its been no secret that her voice had been in a state of steady decline and that she can no longer sing the songs she sang as a 12-year-old. If nothing else, this CD walks us through an anthology of her songs which chronicles her decline right down to a warbling attempt at the song ""Bridge Over Troubled Water""; a rendition considered so bad that it was dropped from her last album. It could also be a good lesson for any aspiring teen singer on how NOT to proceed in a singing career; with the resulting adverse consequences painfully obvious as you progress into the songs from her 4th album. Otherwise, I cannot recommend this recording to anyone who simply is looking for some singing enjoyment."
1,Disappointing,"As a singer of light classical and pop, I was disappointed to hear Charlotte's progression (digression) from a child prodigy to what amounts to being a pedestrian vocalist. I concur with another reviewer who suggested they should have re-issued her first CD ""Voice of an Angel"". However even that work could not even hold a candle to 12-year-old Aselin Debison. Charlotte needs to go to a conservatory of music and attempt to recapture whatever she had early on. Prelude can only be interpreted as a prelude to retirement."
2,Wrong Songs,"I believe that the reason so many people do not like this album is because whomever selected the songs did a very poor job. In my opinion, where charlotte shines would be in the Rest of Charlotte Church not the Best of Charlotte Church. Check previous albums for better songs."
1,The Immaterial Girl,"I disagree with those who say that Charlotte's voice is bad or that she can't sing. She certainly has a better voice than many of the ""pop"" singers I've heard of late. The problem is with the songs she sings. They have almost all been done before, and the versions which were done before were clearly superior to hers. ""All Love Can Be"" was new and she did a credible job there. ""Just Say Hello"" was also new but was marred with so much controversy as to become a nullity in a musical sense. So, Charlotte is not bringing much of anything new to the table in this compilation and the novelty of her young age is no longer applicable. I would agree with some other reviewers in that she must come in with more original songs to have any material impact on the music world."
1,Can We Turn Back The Clock?,"Charlotte was a tough act to follow as a 12-year-old and that goes even for herself at an older age. She never came back to the form and voice she had with Voice of an Angel and this album, Prelude, is a testament to that. I'm not really sure what the title ""Prelude"" signifies, but the fact is that Charlotte has seen her best days as a singer. The 4 ""new"" songs which she has in this CD, when compared to the 5 songs from VOAA will aptly demonstrate that. I believe that they would have been better off releasing some of Charlotte's ""live"" performances as a 12 and 13-year-old. That is something that the public could remember her by. This album simply presents a downward spiral."
5,~ Whicked ~,"Hey this is one great alblum, it has all her greatest hits on it from her past 4 CD's and has 4 unrelesed songs on it. I own all five alblums and they are spectacular! I hope she comes out with another soon which features all new music. If you dont own any of her alblums bye this one it feateures all her best performances!"
1,A lesson in singing to early.,"This album should have never been made. None of Charlotte Church's albums should have been made. She was too young and her voice was too fragile. She should have been singing in church choirs not huge stages. This album is horrible. Her technique and breathing is horrendous and her pitch is not placed at all. With a lot of training she may and I emphasis may have been able to sing in a opera choir but her voice is not impressive, despite her age and all she will do is ruin it. I'm not sure if that really matters though."
2,I feel bad for Charlotte,"There's no denying the girl has talent, but enough for opera? I don't think so. I'm no professional, but her voice is weak to my ears. She's raspy, airy and sounds just plain weak. She doesn't sing from her stomach, but from the back of her throat. Very annoying to listen to."
4,Just the right speed...,It's a combination of luck and skill...just the right game for my wife and I to play with our daughters. Good speed...quick and with yuks...
2,"Poor Material, Bad Sizing","Just like 95% of the costumes on the market, the material is cheap. Not quite sure where the sizing came from. My wife who is between a medium and large depending on the brand said there is no way this is even a size 12."
3,Cute costume,"What you see is what you get. It's not constructed wonderfully, but it does the job for a costume party. I am a size 4/6 and it fit. Most of all, I have a 3 and 7 year old and they LOVED that Mommy was Minnie Mouse."
2,Size Misleading,The costume states it is a 12-14 size. I am a size 8-10 and it took two people to get it over my head. Then it was so tight and uncomfortable. And it is itchy. Other than that it is a cute costume.
5,minnie mouse costume,"GREAT COSTUME..RECEIVED SO MANY COMPLIMENTS ON THIS COSTUME..GREAT QUALITY...GREAT FIT, AND I AM A SIZE 4/6..."
4,Beautiful Tragedy,"Former Satan-worshipper and convicted serial killer Bill Keane stuns the world again with this wonderful little piece of writing. Definitely one of my favorite books, this is the story of a young boy's road to death. Keane has incorporated many personal experiences into this book, making it almost autobiographical. He excels in describing young Jeffy's late night Satanic rituals,... After Jeffy's father discovers of these practices, Jeffy is sent to jail, where the story takes a dramatic turn, as Jeffy develops a homosexual relationship with four fellow inmates..., 3 of whom are over 20 years older than him. The final scene, where Jeffy is put to death in the electric chair, is one of the best written pieces of literary mastership I have ever read in my life, as well as a culmination of years of suffering for Jeffy. ...Truly amazing"
4,"Not a bad effort, Keane","The Keane-ster dazzles us again with his light-hearted depictions of weekend life in an American family. My family and I get many laughs from this! Each cartoon is well drawn, and the puns are hilarious. Keane really creates a positive, happy feeling. It would be great if Keane brought back Not Me and Ida Know for the next book!"
3,Great Medieval Hack & Slash novel,"Great action story,reminiscient of Conan,of a European knight and his band of mercenaries returning from the Crusades and seeking vengeance on those that betrayed them to the Saracens.A great read,but the series was never finished.Mark Ramsay is the pen name for author Jon Maddox Roberts,writer of the SPQR series,among others.Will this series ever be finished?Will Draco ever avenge his father?"
2,Does not hit the spot,"Both the music and the scenery from this DVD do noy deliver.It does not give you the impact like the ""Visions of...."" series do. Disappointing."
4,"Play to me, Gypsy","A roller coaster of a novel, dealing with a passel of repo men and women and a whole tribe of gypsies. A hilarious story of magnificent scams and cons. An in depth study on the repossession of cars for a bank that holds the defaulted loans. Of course, the two intertwine and the results are beautiful.Unfortunately, the author chose to write in very short chapters with constantly changing scenery. Add to that the ever changing names, and the result can become rather confusing."
4,Did what it was supposed to do,I sold my house in San Francisco without a broker (my first house sale). The buyer actually drew up the sales contract but this book helped me understand who should pay for what fees.The only thing that this book lacked that could have gotten me in trouble was that it failed to mention a San Francisco-specific report called the 3R report (the City issues it to list all permits that it has issued for the property). Fortunately I had a friend who was a realtor who checked to make sure I had all the forms.

4,"Missing Part however, this one is played with most","A part of the mobile was missing when unpacked. Contacted the Manufacturer however, They do not ship out missing parts, and to repack this and send it back to Amazon... oh well.It is played with a lot and the balloon going up and down is enjoyed most and then the swinging door and the roof-top playground. Overall they will probaly like the toy a lot, it is just that Calico Quality Assurance is getting more lax."
2,Calico Critters Baby Playhouse,"Well, we ordered this item for Christmas, and when we assembled it we noticed that the windmill appeared broken. We contacted the seller who very graciously sent us another one since Calico Critters doesn't offer replacement parts. Crazy on Callico Critters part! Anyway, we received the ""new"" playhouse today only to find that the windmill is broken in it as well! Obviously, there is a packing problem where the windmill gets damaged during transport or the windmill is just poorly assembled/created by the manufacturer. We have many many Calico items, and this has been a dissapointment as far as quality and durability! At this point we have two houses with defective windmills! I wouldn't recommend this toy because of the poor durability. I will note, however, that my daughter still enjoys playing with it, but she gets frustrated when the windmill falls off as it does with play."
4,Very cute and small,"My daughter likes this toy, but like all CC toys, the pieces are tiny. She loves the slide and the stairs, so overall a good choice. BTW, the picture shows the payground attached, and make sure your child doesn't think that is included! ;)"
2,Nothing special,"The noodles were better than I thought instant rice noodles would be. That said, that was the only positive I can think of. Rice noodles being as bland as they are, I expected a much more flavorful soup. What little flavor I could make out in the soup wasn't good, and didn't fit the description. (If ""Chinese Onion Flavor"" means something significantly different than ""onion flavor,"" ignore me.) I would not have connected this to onions unless I had read it on the package. I'm not sure how to describe the little taste that's in it. It tastes bad."
4,A touching and real memoir,"I just finished reading this book, and spent as much time crying as I did laughing. It's basically a really engaging collection of episodes from an Irish youth spent making the most of a situation marked with the sadness of an absent, alcohholic father. I read Angela's Ashes several years ago, but found this memoir to be so much more refreshing because it's so much less ""literary"" and so much more personable. The voice with which the stories are told is more common than McCourt's (in my opinion almost contrived) loftiness, and the image I most often had in mind was Connelly as my own father, telling random stories from memory as they occurred to him, and as he remembered them. In spite of the hardships he was faced with, this guy was a champ at finding the fun and wonder in the simple things he had before him. I live in Brooklyn today, but Connelly made me wish for some of the Brooklyn of yesterday."
5,Great machine for a great price,"I ordered this D.P. due to it's generous motor size for a bench top machine and the price. I've been very satisfied so far. The machine came well packaged and all parts were present and easy to assemble. This machine is somewhat large for a bench top press, as the head is the same head on the floor model. I would recommend this machine to anyone."
1,Jet Bench Drill Press,"I just received my drill press. The handle that raises the table is too short to reach anything and consequently, the table cannot be raised or lowered unless it is done manually without use of the handle. Did anyone have this problem?When I called Jet they told me to take it to a repair shop. It is brand new why do I need it repaired?Thanks.Joe"
4,Well-built and does the job.,"Overall, I am happy with this machine. It is well-built, but there is a slight wobble in the chuck. This could, however, be how I installed it. I'm going to try redoing that.It is larger and higher than I expected for a benchtop drill press. It is very heavy because it is a floor-model remade to a bench-model. It is too high to be on my regular 36"" bench. I had to have a lower,very sturdy table to set this on, which I hadn't planned on.Still, it does a good job. I wanted to drill into 3/4"" steel and it does this very well."
3,An adequate performance underwhelms all!,"This old recording comes from the early days of what will become Naxos, the powerhouse record company that has certainly come into its own. However, do not look for good sound recording or solid and moving musical interpretation. In its early days, the label's concern was just producing cheap albums for people to purchase who really didn't have any preconceived notions about what a good performance should sound like. That might have worked in 1990, but nowadays, you can get the best performances with superlative sound for dirt cheap. So what does that portend for this album? Oblivion. Hearing the Leonara Overture No.2 is a treat, but the Sixth is too well-known for anyone to prefer this performance over all the others. So, keep looking elsewhere, unless you really love Bratislava."
3,CHEATED,"This game was very important to me growing up because it was the first time I ever saw color television. I watched it with my failing grandpa. Alas, though the film was broadcast by NBC in living color the dvd is in black and white!!!!! The broadcast is just as it was by NBC except in a poor quality black and white. It is also very overpriced. This is the game in which Bob Gibson broke the WS strikeout mark besting 31 game winner--and later convicted felon--Denny McClain. It is very interesting from a baseball historical perspective but it is not in COLOR. Ironically NBC blurbs throughout the game ""broadcast in living color."" I feel rooked."
4,Well-acted version but wish it were widescreen,"I just finished watching this video. It's full-screen, and you wind up with half an actress' face or just someone's arm, or a voice without a body. Very annoying. And it talks about Lincoln as if this book were written after his assasination.Aside from that, this is well-acted and well-sung and is really pretty good. A few times one wonders about the background or history of something (where'd Simon get his scar -- and is it even important) but there's continuity, good singing, and good acting."
4,Good for Everything Snip,"This snip really fills in a nice niche where you need to cut more than paper but less than thick metal. It is especially useful due to its size it can get into smaller spaces and make smaller, short cuts. Note: it is not a tin snips - so if you are really looking for heavy duty, this is not it. But it is great for what it is purposed for."
4,Part of my Emergency Kit,"I probably own four or five of these shears. I keep 1 set in each of my first aid kits, and a set in my tool box. They cut well, hold up well, and don't take up much space.A good deal"
5,heal inflamation,"have used this product before. it is a digestive enzyme, which also helps with decreasing inflammation associated with sprains and strains. using it for post knee surgery. seems to helping with my healing phase."
2,Did nothing for me,"A friend recommended and I after going through several bottles was greatly disappointed. Maybe works for muscles aches, but essentially it was wasted money for me."
3,NOT THE BEST...,"Alison Wolfe has a great voice. I loved Bratmobile, I loved Cold Cold Hearts...I wanted to love Deep Lust, but something fell short.Yes, her great vocals are still there and her approach to writing song lyrics has not changed, but the music seems monotonous and overplayed. Songs where the same few guitar licks are played over and over for an entire albums worth of songs gets old - fast. The drumming and guitar playing is competant, but the music never seems to catch up to Alison's singing...And that's a shame."
3,Lust for Deep Lust,"Allison Wolfe in full form on this release. The music isn't always that exciting but the passion is there. I love her work with Bratmobile, Cold Cold Hearts and her current group, Partyline. In my opinion there are only four stand-out tracks on this release. The cover of the song ""Changeling"" by the Doors is fantastic and a great opener. ""Mass Teens on the Run(s)"" is a classic example of Wolfe's lyrical work; it is brutually honest and delivered in a voice that you can't help but love. When she says, ""I met my Mr. 90210 and I made my list of grievances"" you want to laugh but at the same time you KNOW what she means! ""Nice Try, No Piranah is a fun tune but one of my favorites involves explicit references to Tipper Gore in ""think yr the better one"". Also ""Is That a Fact"" is a good one!"
5,great style at work here,"I just finished this one two nights ago and am here looking for more Westlake stories. I read the pulps all the time, and this one really has a style all its own. Bare-bones and cool every step of the way. I loved it..."
5,Tough Guy Fiction At It's Hardboiled Best!!,"This novel is, in a word, FANTASTIC! I defy anyone to pick it up and not devour it in one sitting. With a rocket-fire pace and characters that leap off the page, this revenge tale sucks the reader in to a world of violence and the consequences of that violence. If you think you know where this story's going, you're wrong. Twists and turns abound. And these characters are tough! They make Mike Hammer look like a wimp. Yet they are not one-dimensional. They live and breath and we understand why they do what they do. 361 has been out of print for far too long. This little gem of a book is simply not to be missed. Kudos to Hard Case Crime for bringing it back. A great, great read all the way. One of the best!"
4,"a competent, well-executed crime story","Donald Westlake must have written hundreds of novels and short stories to date. '361' is certainly not among his more widely known novels, which is a shame because it is a very decent read. The somewhat complicated but well explained story is about a young man who is quickly sucked into the criminal underworld by virtue of actions of his father many years earlier. There is death, vengeance and despair. '361' is not a happy story; I doubt if it will ever make Oprah's must read list. Yet Westlake's crisp dialogue and very readable prose make '361' an enjoyable read. Is it some long lost classic? No, not by a long shot. But few readers would be disappointed.Bottom line: a curious journey into the New York underworld circa 1960. Certainly worth a look."
4,An eye for revenge,"361, published originally back in 1962 and in 2005 by Hard Case Crime, is a classic hardboiled detective story. Things go bad for the protagonist - his father is killed, while he ends up with a gimp foot and a blind eye - and then, it gets worse.Like in any hardboiled novel worth the label, 361 has plenty of action, both gunfights and fistfights. The hero empties a bottle of booze about every two pages. This is definitely not high literature, but 361 is a gripping book I'm sure many people will read in one sitting. It has great entertainment value, simply put."
1,Poor Quality,"Picture quality is very mediocre. As other posters have noted, a little more money gets much more bang for the buck. A friend recently bought a Canon Powershot A520 and it seems like much more camera for the money.A firmware upgrade is causing a premature ""Batteries are depleted"" message. See - http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&q;=HP+M22+batteries+depletedPros - Compact size. Weather resistant.Cons - No optical viewfinder. I guess that's a size tradeoff. Poor picture quality. I usually shoot with a D70, but even for the money the M22 doesn't seeem like a good value."
1,Do not buy this camera,"The camera is a piece of junk. I wish I could change my number of stars to 0. I previously wrote a good review of this camera because it started out working great. Now, you can't take a CLEAR picture of anything unless it is resting on a flat, non-moving surface. Otherwise, good luck trying to make out whatever is in the picture. Everyone who has used my camera has told me that it is terrible.I bought this camera as an ""upgrade"" from my previous HP 3.0 megapixel camera. I want my old camera back! I don't know if this is just a poorly made model because I haven't had problems with any other HP cameras. Do yourselves a favor, save yourselves some money, don't buy this M22."
1,You need to take a standby camera,This camera works whenever it wants. After contacting customer support he suggested me to do a power reset. I lost confidence on this piece and shopping for a new one. Probably I will pay more and go to SD450 or SD500Also make sure you carry couple of batteries for a day trip( for 75 pictures) :)
2,returning after 2 days,I had the same problem as the other reviewer. my batteries died quickly heck i even bought the energizer lithium batteries that they recommend so much. my camera like hers worked when ever it wanted too. i don't know maybe the other reviewers got lucky and their camera works. when the camera did work i did manage to get some nice pictures of my cats. i'll probably buy a different brand next time.
1,The bad override the good in this camera,"Besides its sleek look and compact size this camera has nothing good to offer. The digital quality of the pictures are POOR, it wastes batteries way too fast and you can't zoom in."
3,Cheap Value for a Cheap Price,"I guess it's true that you get what you pay for. The thing that really disappoints me about this camera is that the zoom function is not actually a zoom at all. It is actaually a ""cropping"" function. ""Zooming"" with this camera actually reduces the size of your photo rather than giving you a full-size closeup. Very disappointed."
4,HP M22 Camera- buy stock in battery company,This camera takes great photos and is easy to use. My 11 year old daughter loves it. BUT..... it goes through batteries like candy. We have been using regular alkaline batteries and our recharger does not load them with enough power to be re-usable. We are hoping to soon acquire a battery & charger set designed for the camera.
5,GOOD STARTER CAMERA,Bought my M22 in 2005. Still works good. No problems. Battery life is good. Pix are good quality. No complaints.
1,UNWISE PURCHASE,"CAMERA ARRIVED WITHOUT INSTRUCTION INFORMATION, TWO DEAD AA BATTERIES, NO CABLES, A MISSING COVER ON A BOTTOM PORT.DATE ON CAMERA WAS 2005, WHICH WOULD MEAN IT SET SOMEWHERE FOR SEVEN YEARS. THE FLASH DOSEN'T WORK AND THE PICTURES ARE GRAINY. NO WRIST STRAP. BAD PURCHASE."
1,"Balky Performance, Failed At End of Warranty Period","There is a small sliding door on the face of the device which activates the camera. It's performance was balky (sometimes it worked, sometimes not). I could live with that---but the unit failed after precisely 371 days of ownership (it had a 1-year warranty). I'll never buy an HP camera again."
2,Not worth what I paid for it,"Honestly, when I bought this camera at full price when it first came out, I thought it was a great deal. Boy, was I wrong. The camera is absolutely horrible on batteries. So when I actually wanted to use the darn thing I was never able to because the batteries were drained after having them in for about 20. I eventually just started popping the batteries in right when I used the camera to save them. The mechanism that slides over the view finder eventually gave up as well.It did however deserve a couple of stars only because the picture quality of the camera proved to be not so bad.In the end, if you're gonna spend money on a digital camera in the first place, I recommend shelling out a few extra bucks on a pricier camera. It will definitely turn out to save you frustration and the money it takes to work it in the first place."
5,A must have !!!,It's a greed collection if you are a fan of Dallas :-) I love it. It's an introduction to story what happend when jock and digger were young guys and JR maybe 18.... I absolutely recommend it.
4,Good box set,With the new Dallas coming on TV I thought that I would get caught up on things since the show ended. The movies were Ok but then the new show does not take them into consideration anyway. Still is something that will not be shown on TV very often so this is the next best way to see them.
3,Finally!.....except....,"I am so glad these movies are finally coming out. I've been looking for The Early Years all over the place. It's hard to come by. Got a hold of a poorly reproduced copy of JR Returns. It'll do until this new DVD comes out. Hopefully it'll be good quality. They should also include The Ewing Bloopers. I bought that from someone online a few years ago, but again it's a poor quality DVD. Hilarious to watch though. Some bloopers are included with the reunion special, but The Ewing Bloopers in uncensored and includes a lot more. I was a huge Dallas fan, just twelve years old when it started. Watched it all the way through. I love the cast as if they were my own family, and watching the reunion and the Bloopers gives you a feel for who these people are in real life, not just on-screen."
5,gave as a gift,"came on time and was what was ordred. Gave as a gift to a true Dallas Fan and was thrilled,"
3,Not as good as the Dallas series,"The second movie was just plain campy and silly!!! All in all, I'm glad I can add it to my collection."
3,Two Coldplay essentials! But....,"This is really not for everybody. Really, just get their two albums and you won't need this! Don't get me wrong, I am a huge Coldplay fan and Clocks and Yellow were some of the highlights of their career. But, if you have their two albums, you don't need to buy this. If you are getting into this great band, just buy Parachutes and A Rush. This is pretty much useless unless you want to complete your collection OR you want the live version of Yellow (which is good). That's all."
5,The Cutest Child's Book of All Time!!!!!!!,"I had this book for a very long time, and I loved it! It's a cute book that teaches children the alphabet and it's a cute game that I used to play when I was younger. I still have this book, and I have a reason to: When I become a mother and have kids of my own, I'll be able to read it to them! : )"
3,Good Kids Fantasy,"If they are in the third grade, they can enjoy it. Sure, battle/gore in books four (dwarves vs goblins) and five (griffin vs dragons), but it's part of the typical fantasy adventure experience. The movie actually skips the events in #4 for being less than kid-friendly in the visual, but it seems a favorite amoung the actual kids I've discussed the books with.Overall, fine for kids, unless you are feeling overprotective. As an adult fantasy reader, an average experience -- don't go out of your way here."
3,Very easy,This is a good book sereies. It is very short and easy. You could a volume of it in at the most an hour. Want a book that doesn't take forever to get to the good stuff. Read this. My favorite was the action packed Wrath of Mulgrath. The Iron Wood Tree and The Seing Stone are good too. I wasn't to impressed with The Feild Guide or Lucindas secret. But the Feild Guide was good enough to turn me on to this series and I'm sure it'll be the same for many others to come. If you want better books with a touch of the super natural read Deltora Quest Forests Of Silence. It will turn you on to a whole other series filled with magic and action. Neither Of these are for little kids. Spiderwick would be suitable for age eight and up. Deltora is suitable for ten and up. Either way Spiderwick is great and has turned me into lover of books. It May do the same for you.
5,Reading Time with my Granddaughter,"My granddaughter and I read these books together. We love the illustrations and the mystery/fantasy story lines. The plots for each book, included in one volume, were unpredictable which led to fun and suspense."
5,Spiderwick,This is a great series of books that will keep someone at any age engaged. The books are beautiful and have great illustrations.
5,Perfect Collection of Fantasy,My husband and I saw the movie based on these books and became intrigued by the story. I immediately ordered the book collection after the movie ended. These books are very sweet with writing and illustrations that will lead any child into a wonderful world of fantasy. This collection would be a special reading experience for grandparents with their grandchildren but also for all parents who enjoy fantasy and want to introduce their children to the fun world of make believe.
4,Good books for kids,"A very nice packaging for a good children's fantasy series. These are the books that the recent movie was based off of, and it is a pretty quick read. Definitely more for children and young teenagers, without the mass appeal of the Harry Potter series. Still a very good read."
4,Decent Kid's Books,"Not bad for kid's books, but a little lacking... each book is more like a chapter (I read the entire series in two hours). Great for kids who aren't into reading, but the layout and set-up of the book was a little strange. I felt like I was reading a picture book, and while the illustrations were well-done, they were a little distracting. It certianly wouldn't have interested me at twelve (and maybe not even at nine), but for younger kids it's a fun fantasy adventure."
5,Spiderwick Chronicles,"I actually bought this as a gift, and I have not read the books myself. However, I was pleased with the presentation. The case and the books inside are very cute."
3,"Good Story, AWFUL Narration.","When I purchased this I didn't realize that they were 5 short books in on series. I just wanted an idea of what the movie may be before I took my kids to see it.That being said it's very short. The story was good, but the narration was goofy, almost comical at times. I went from Harry Potter all 7 with Jim Dale to this. I was less than Impressed. Mark Hamillshould stick to being a Starwars geek hero, and just leave it there.DO NOT expect this to be like Harry Potter it is not even close. This is simpler and less climatic. Great for kids who don't like to read though."
2,Reviews from Brizmus Blogs Books,"These books are for someone way younger than me. Each of them takes about a half hour to read, and I didn't read them all together, which I definitely should have. Maybe then I would have liked them more. As it as, I was kind of bored and spent the whole time wishing there were less of them and that they were over. I wouldn't have finished had I not been a little bit curious. And I wouldn't have been curious had there not been so many mystical creatures. So I guess it was okay. It was just,. . .VERY young. Even for me."
1,Dull,I wasn't impressed with the books (the movie is much better though). The writing is average. The characters and plot are dull.
4,SPIDER WICK the SEEING STONE,"I really like this book because its so good.It's about this boy named Jared Grace, and a girl named Mallory. They find a very interesing book. It's a truly cool book. You have to read this story to find out what the book is about. I didn't like the part when Jared was being really mean. What I liked most in the book, is when a old man said, ""There's my dancing partner."""
1,Spiderwick review,My daughter enjoyed reading these books. They arrived in a timely manner as well as excellent condition.
1,Disappointed,"I purchased this book as a gift for my granddaughter. I was very disappointed when it came to see that it had been packaged with the cover all bent up and torn. I thought I was purchasing a new book, not a used one."
3,There are better series out there.,"My kids love fantasy, but if the book's too scary it can give them nightmares. So,when I'm unsure of the series, I'll read it myself first. I just finished reading all 5 of the Spiderwick books. There were some unique ideas in them, and they were entertaining. But my kids wouldn't be able to handle the part where cats were roasted and eaten by goblins, and they wouldn't like the idea of a cow being chained down while baby dragons nurse from her with sharp teeth until she's bloody. It was too gross for me, and I know that it would be too upsetting for my kids. I am not going to give these to my kids, and honestly, I'm not sure what to do with my copies.I can recommend the following fantasy books: Magyk by Angie Sage, or the Enchanted Forest Chronicles (4 books) by Patricia Wrede."
4,Good for reluctant/slow readers,"My son started getting these books when he was around 9. He's a huge Harry Potter fan but those books were a bit intimidating--the size of them just keep growing (great for me, not for him!) I read each Spiderwick before he did and found them mildly entertaining--and Tony DiTerlizzi's illustrations are fantastic! My son was excited about each one and read them a couple times each. I thought the books were well-planned and carefully created. These don't really look like children's books--the hardcovers have a leather-bound appearance and there's a colorplate at the beginning of each book. This lends to the books being perceived as something for older children; which is great when your child has a hard time reading but doesn't want to read ""baby books."""
3,Good for young adults not for adults,"There was another reviewer who said it well, this is not for a book for adults who like Harry Potter and fairytailish stories.This is definitely geared for a simplier audience (nothing wrong with that.)If you're expecting a higher or more complex writing style as in Harry Potter then move on.All in all, it was a decent storyline and some interesting fairy characters."
4,fast service,Received the books fast. Bought as a gift and my son enjoy's them very much. I will order again
4,wish there were more...,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this series! Light reading with a few dark moments, terrific illustrations, and a magical sense of stepping into another world which is what a good book should do for the reader. I would recommend this series to anyone wanting to escape for a while and I am left wishing for more..."
4,"Great Series, Despite Shortfalls","This book is the most imaginative I've seen in a while. The mystical creatures depicted in the series are surprisingly believable; after all, they are invisible. And the setting perfectly fits the feel of these creatures. The setting, an old dilapidated mansion and surrounding estate, goes with the feel of the book.Jared, Simon, and Mallory Grace all find a mysterious field guide that kick-starts the rest of the series. Everything from a little household brownie to a huge griffin are depicted. Not knowing what everything means, these children go off on their adventures following the ""Faeries.""I loved the plotline, even though it seemed very choppy. The books are very short and not exactly cheap. One suggestion would be to combine some of the smaller books to make larger ones. And the books, when bought alone, are expensive at $10.00 a piece. But, despite its downfalls, The Spiderwick Chronicles are worth your time."
2,"Great story, missing chapter",The story is great. Chapter 1 of Book 5 was missing from the CDs however. A big problem.
4,I was immediately hooked.,"Having seen the preview for the Spiderwick Chronicles movie (coming out in Feb. '08)I was compelled to pick up the 1st book and by the next day, I was clammoring for the rest of the series. The 2nd and 5th books of the series are very exciting. Not since I read The Gingerbread Kingdom, have I been captivated by a young adult fantasy book. One of my favorite things about these books are the detailed illustrations. Once I saw the troll from the 1st book, I just knew that along with a great story, I would also be treated to a feast for the eyes.Highly recommended!"
5,Spiderwick is a great book series!,The books are really interesting. They are the only books that I found that I really LIKE to read!
5,Books,We received the Spiderwick books and they were in excellent condition.We also received them in appropriate time.This seller was excellent.
4,"Good story, not best I've ever read.","I could easily picture the characters. The writing was descriptive and easy to follow. Stories are short. The monsters were well thought out and described well, it was easy to picture them in action. A little bit of humor with some good surprises. I am 9."
5,Great books,"This was the ""must have"" series that the other crumb-snatchers were talking about on the school bus when we bought them, and they have been well-worn. Nice, attractive set of books."
4,The Wrath Of Mulgrath,"This book is about three children that discover a magical land full of unknown creatures. The kids always get into mischief when their mom is gone. In the Wrath of Mulgrath all the magic comes out. For example, Thimbletack, the house brownie, spun a ball of string around a hobgoblin with his finger. I would compare this book to Harry Potter because they both have magic and three kids that always get into mischief. My favorite character is Mallory because she is always heroic. I recommend this book for third grade and up because it has sophisticated words like sophisticated. I would give this book a four star rating."
5,You can see your childs eyes light up,"My children are just starting to really like books, usually they read books about animals or fun children stories. the enjoy Harry Potter, but mostly the movies and not the books, so I decided to start them with this series, and they were hooked from the start, I don't know how many times a day they asked me to read to them, and after we read they couldn't wait to hear the next chapter and the next. I grew up reading books, my kids are growing up in an age were books are second to televition, dvd's and computers, but is nice to see the joy a child can get from reading a well written story."
2,disappointing,"I was interested to read these books, based on the reviews I read. I ordered the five volume set of the first five books, thinking I'd be able to settle in and read for a good long time. It was disappointing to receive a set of five tiny books, each containing one scant chapter. At a cost of over $5.00 each, this could be the most expensive children's book ever, once you read all the different volumes. So, not much of a story, and a rip-off if you look at value, which you should certainly look at. One of the many satisfying things about the Harry Potter books is that they are full books, some quite long, and very engrossing, even as a re-read."
2,Wisdom? Hardly.,Trite and disappointing. Reads like a box of fortune cookies. Small thoughts masquerading as deep thoughts. The blurbs are so similar that it's nearly impossible to tell one page from the next.
4,Depends on your frame of mind,"I think you need to be in the right frame of mind to appreciate this book. i happened to be feeling very open and free when i picked it up and it really touched me at times, and still does.However, had i been in a bad or closed off mood, i probably would have thought it was trite and amateurish."
3,Interesting Subject Written Poorly,"Where in the world did the author pick this title!!! The subject matter is so interesting but is hidden by the title. The CDC's EIS officers come alive in some wonderful chapters, but the author uses or misuses English often with dangling participles and obscure uses of ""it"" with the reader confused about what ""it"" refers to! Intriguing looks at diseases and how and where they are fought...in more capable hands and with a better title, the book would be a best seller!"
5,Brooklyn from the Rooftops,"An edgy 'coming into herself' story with a twist -- Cobwebs creates a parallel universe out of Brooklyn, a place of rooftops and water towers, of angels who protect strangers and romance between a tender-hearted skinhead and a dark, tangled girl who tromps the streets in her Doc Martins because she can't fly. This marvel of a book is magic realism at its best."
1,Awful,"ok, this book was about a girl with the powers of a spider. By not shaving her legs she is more powerful. Isn't that stupid? I mean the whole book was like that. Plus, there was no real story line. I mean she kept jumping from her grandmother to Dion stalking her to the New York angel. The ending was confusing and stupid. Then at one point she'd complain because she is afraid of heights. Sure, he's a spider too. It was awful. Now before you say ""Oh she hated it so she didn't even finish it. How would she know?"" Well I did finish the book. I don't think you should write a review unless you do. For this book I'd only give it half a star but that wasn't an option. Please don't waste your time. Try a different book."
2,"The Stock Car Racing Chassis: Out of date, inaccurate.","At the time that this book was written back in the 1970's, there was not a lot of information available on how to build and set up a stock car. This book filled that void. However, it is so out of date, with information that has since been proven inaccurate that I would not recommend this book. You might get something out of the book, but Steve Smith has so many other books that are far better, I wouldn't waste my money on this one."
4,Its fun,"I don't understand why everyone is giving this game such a bad review. I recently bought this game and I am having a great time with it. Granted the controls are a little lacking, but once you get used to them they really aren't that bad. Everyone is saying how impossible the controls are, these are the people who believe the controls should be catered to them, part of the game is adapting to the game. The story line is funny and I got to tell you, Sarge just cracks me up. I really enjoy this game because of the real life battle fields because when I was a kid I used to spend hours playing with my little plastic army figures, and creating mock battles in my mind. Now I can play that battle. Most of the bad reviews probably come from people who automatically don't like games that they are not good at right away, don't let them fool you, this is fun."
5,Cory's Perspective,"This CD is awesome! On this album you get to see another side of Cory which could only be replicated by going to a live show. The CD has three studio recordings and thirteen live tracks, not to mention a bonus two hour DVD! The melodies range from some of his very first songs up to new unreleased tracks, which gives you a full spectrum of Cory's talents; hence the title ""Full Exposure"". The CD is great, but the DVD is another party in itself. With over two hours of concert footage from tours, to Cory burnin' rubber in an old school porche, the DVD can serve as a concert in your house! If you are even thinking of getting this CD, YOU DEFINITELY SHOULD!"
2,"Great concept, wrong storyline",I enjoyed this Anime until I got to the middle to the end. It was disappointing. I like the concept of how the girl who is a ballet dancer finds her step with the rideback. I hatted how the group got involved in some terrorist plot.
4,Better then expected,"I bought this anime on a whim and was pleasantly surprised. The story line is good, well written and keeps your interest. I wish it had been a bit longer so the story line and character development could have been fleshed out a bit more."
1,"Not My Cup of Tea - And Pass the Rolaids, Please...","My friend swears by this tea. Other reviewers sing its praises. I don't get it. I find it to be a coarse, heavy, undrinkable tea. The taste is reminiscent of tobacco. One reviewer called it ""sturdy."" That it is-- kind of the tea equivalent to the worst diner coffee you've ever had. I can't imagine serving this at a high tea. I am a fan of Tazo's Darjeeling tea, which may explain my reaction to PG Tips. There is nothing refined or nuanced in this cup."
2,ESQ Muse,I was given this watch by my husband several years ago. Watch is beautiul and the battery lasts a really long time. What was not great is the jewerly bracelet style clasp. I sent it back to ESQ to be replaced once and just over a year later the clasp was not staying shut. The cost of the repair was about half the cost of the watch. Until they switch the clasp i wouuld not reccommend.
2,Not so Good purchase,This is a good buy although I expected the Movado name to be written since it is a line of that brand. However this watch lasted just 2 years
3,This book says it all,"When I read this book, it was a revelation. This lady said what I had been feeling and thinking. It is great to know you are not alone, you are not crazy and that all these weird things that have been happening are real, because they do happen to others. Honest, funny, touching but above all it helped me to accept my MS and get on with life."
1,depressing and horribly edited,"Do not read this if you are not depressed or angry about being diagnosed with MS. It is disheartening and seems to assume that MS will start to define your identity. The author does many annoying things, including referring frequently in a mocking tone to a mythical person with MS who jogs. If you have MS but are not (or not yet) suffering serious symptoms, look elsewhere."
4,Very relatable,This book was so funny and I've had the same MS moments she talks about. It is always nice to know there are others like me out there.
2,"Funny, but...","I think it's cool when somebody can write their own story and it's entertaining plus informative. I would give this more stars on the rating, but when I read a book I want a professional product and this one seemed like it was self published. I like the story though, the writer has a funny outlook."
2,Nothing new here,"I bought this book because, in a quick look at the bookstore, it seemed to take a relaxed, calming approach to wedding planning, and I was lured by its tasteful cover compared to the glaring pink and flower & bells bedecked covers of its neighbors. However, I did not find this book to be remotely useful. Despite its title, it had very little to offer by way of making your wedding unique or personalized. It also did not have much helpful advice for coping with the stresses and organizational nightmares of planning a wedding."
4,Out of print,"If you're purchasing a used copy of this book, please note the original price was $14.95 US / $21.95 Canada."
4,Review of Bandoleer,Sandy Seaton and his adopted sister Mistie live on a mountain ranch and love their horses. This is the third in the series - `Pagan The Black' and 'Fabulous' being the other two. Bandoleer is the colt foal of Sandy's stud Pagan and Mistie's mare Sunrise. The group have lots of adventures and hardships and life is made harder by the separations involved in the young people's attending college throughout this book. I would strongly recommend reading the other two first.
1,Not what I thought I was going to get!,I imagined I was going to get at least 12 inch stalks...when I go the three stalks in the mail they were TINY. I put them in miracle grow and they just dont seem to be going very good. I have taken care of Cannas before and never had a problem!
3,ok,this product needs to be worn outside of a shirt becasue it tends to dig into your arm pits slightly and causes some redness at the end of the day.
1,Not as I expected,"I bought this item hoping it would bring some comfort to my aching upper back. Instead, I have more pain than ever. This seemed like such a good idea when I bought it, boy was I wrong. Don't even think wearing this under your clothing is an option. It will rub your underarms raw! The first day I wore it (only a couple of hours)under my clothing, I couldn't even try it again for several days because it rubbed my underarms so raw. So then I thought I would give it a try over my clothing when at home or sleeping...I still can't have it on for more than an hour or so. It is the most uncomfortable thing I have ever tried to wear. At least the price is inexpensive. That's the only star I give it! Hope this is helpful to someone."
4,Inspiring series - inspiring book,"Gormenghast was a fantastic adaption of the books by Mervyn Peake. I was a set builder at the time and was facinating to be drawn into this amazing world. The book is full of information about how they made this programme. It shows the creative process woven into the actual story. A marvelous reference book for any filmmaker, set builder, costume designer or lover of great TV."
2,"You think it's tha BOMB, but it's NOT!","At first I looked at the CD and said ""Whhhhoooooaaa""! This is tight! How can you have such a great CD with so many of the awesome rappers like Dre, Snoop, 2pac, and Mix-A-Lot? And at such a low price? I couldn't wait to get home after my Mom told me it arrived in the mail when I was on a trip. Well, they fooled me alright! It's not even by the actual rappers and hip-hoppers themselves. It's sung by two wannabes who can rhyme, but can't rhyme to all the songs! And, to top that off, they changed the beats a bit to make it warped! They don't cut out for all the big-timers. You can dance to this, and that would be great, but you can't just sit back and enjoy. So, if you're planning on having several, and I mean several parties, than this CD might be bearable to own. My opinion, save the few bucks this lame CD costs for another CD that might be a little more expensive, but worth it!"
2,"You think it's tha BOMB, but it's NOT!","Before I bought this I thought it was awesome! Look at the price Mom! She said sure. I said cool. I got it in hopes of listening to it nonstop. There's Tupac, Dre, Snoop, Coolio, and all the other awesome rappers! Great CD! You would think. I got it and then discovered it's not sung by the same rappers as it was in its original version (that's why it's so cheap). I thought I could deal with that still, but then I discovered they were the same two rappers for every song, and the beats were messed up! They changed it! You can still recognize the song, and the CD is bearable, but nothing I would listen to for more than a few minutes every once and awhile. It's a loser if your just sitting, dancing to it would be alright cause you're having fun anyway. I say you SHOULD save the very little money it costs for another CD that is way better (even if it's a little more expensive, it's worthwhile)."
4,concerned about the 1 star reviewers,"very sad that some might think this book is a serious one and review it as such.Taken in the vein it's intended, it's great - and was a great engagement gift from one of my bestest friends."
1,Know your place,"Women,Instead of buying this book, maybe you should get back in the kitchen and cook your man some dinner. That would make him shape up much more than reading this book and bitching all the time. Man Day!"
3,How about...,"How to Make Women Put Out - by Professional Cat Breeders...It's amazing what passes for PC these days. Laugh all you want, but at least we can fetch!;-Phttp://www.ShuttleLOUNGE.com"
1,I wonder what the reaction would be if man was replaced with woman?,"This book is simply mass market pandering to women. It's massively sexist and downright pathetic. If you replaced ""Man"" in the title, with ""Woman"", I can guarantee there would be a massive outrage by hypocritical feminists and a lot of women. You know what, maybe I will write a book like this, but about women. See how many jimmies I can rustle."
5,"COME ON, GUYS (and gals), LIGHTEN UP!","This book is a wonderful dramatization of all that Mars/Venus, battle-of-the-sexes, alleged-hopelessness-of-relationships stuff. Read it, laugh, maybe get just a tiny bit more insight into this stuff, and whatever you do, don't take it too seriously. Ever heard of stand-up comedy? Well, this is a stand-up book."
5,cracked me up - and I am a guy!,Sex in The city humor -- but oddly kinda true. I always kid with girlfriend that guys are dogs -- including me -- so she showed me this book! I definitely got a big laugh from it. Some of it is true about both men and women. The author discusses flight and chase behavior -- when your dog is runing away you dont chase after him because that only makes him run away faster. You just act like youre having fun without him -- and the dog just wants to be where the fun is - so he will return. Good counsel for both sexes.
2,Perfect for those who want a lapdog not a man.,"I rated this a '2' simply because I am assuming this is supposed to be funny. Yet wondering how many will take it as how they truly should be? I did not see anything in the book to indicate it was supposed to be funny or light hearted. There are people who believe that the opposite sex needs to be manipulated and treated with disdain. If this is really what the book portends, controlling men, who are all dogs, not just compared to dogs, then I would not recommend that to my worst enemy. Yet if the intent is light hearted humor, it seems a bit warped in it's sense of heavy handed man bashing."
3,whatever...,"Hey Guys, it's humor. It ain't George Carlin or Denis Leary, but I still got a few chuckles out of it. And I'm a guy. Check it out a local book store. If it's not your brand of humor, don't buy it. As for ""gender issues""? If you take this book that seriously...see a therapist."
3,Fun little book,This is a very fun little book. It is not intended to be serious but will definitely give a person some great ideas and plenty of good laughs with friends. Enjoy!
1,Are you people serious?,"You know, demeaning and demoralizing men as dogs really isn't helping make the case for gender equality. In case you are too dense or bitter to realize it, this author is encouraging the same mentality as the male chauvinist types who expect their women to be subservient and submissive. I think people who actually buy into this type of excrement need to take a good, hard look at why they feel so horrible about themselves, and what their real purpose in life is."
4,Don't go by the photo.,"Fiskars 8511 6984 PowerGrip Hand Drill photo shows attached drill bits, just like the one I have owned for years.I have checked the FISKARS website, and the black drill no longer has the 4 drill bits."
3,Good tool; not what is pictured,I've had a couple of these tools and they work pretty well for small jobs and craft items. I bought this one for my 4-year-old son. My only complaint with this particulr purchasing experience is that the tool that came is not the tool that is pictured. (Doesn't have the drill bits).
2,Not as pictured.,"Well, I ordered this item and there were no drill bits included. The product looks similar to the one in the picture, but with no bits. I can't comment on how well it drills, since I returned it."
1,A piece of junk,"I always thought that Fiskars made good scissors and so I bought this little hand drill, 8511 6984 PowerGrip Hand Drill. Big disappointment. It worked for one week with moderate use. The three springed jaws which hold the drill bit slipped down and will not grip. Sending it back."
1,An Honest to Goodness Piece of Junk,"This is the most cheaply made piece of plastic junk I have seen in a long time. The gears constantly skip and slip, it won't reverse and it is just about impossible to remove your bit.You would honestly be better off with the drill in the Handy Andy Tool Kit from the Toy Department; at least you can't hurt yourself too badly with that drill."
1,Poor design,"Upon receit I could tell this item was designed for ""light"" use.Even with this knowlege and efforts to reduce stress on the device it was internally damaged the first time I used it."
1,One metal gear and one plastic gear--metal wins every time.,"This design is from the gnomes of Finland, the nation-state famous for bringing peace and contentment to all the world. They knew that people get bored with drilling holes after a while and just wish the drill would strip its gears. And lo, and behold, it came to pass."
1,Garbage tool - at best a paper weight,"I bought this item because I needed a cordless drill to take on a boating trip and because I respectED the Fiskars name as a quality brand. On the very first attempt to use the drill, the internal gears failed rendering the tool totally useless. I had to resort to drilling with a vice-grip holding the drill bit. That worked better!Now I question whether the Fiskars brand is quality.Don't buy this tool."
2,Great initially...then things start slipping,"When I got this initially, I loved it. Ergonomic. Light. Quick. I used it for all kinds of projects. Then the gears started slipping. I don't know if they wore down, worked themselves apart or what, but it's so disappointing. It's obviously not intended for industrial applications, but it seems like better quality components/construction could easily make this stand up longer than it did. It's a simple design. No reason it couldn't have been made better."
3,Drill disappointment.,"I wanted the model that had self storing bits, which was pictured when I purchased it. The drill is a handy item of decent quality. The delivered drill did not have the self storage. So I am disappointed ... I ordered three drills. The problem is with Amazon, not Fiskars. Wrong Picture."
3,Good tool and good price for what it is.,"It worked good for the most part. After several wholes to drill, then through oak it began to break down. It's great if you want to go through drywall to prehang a anchor and even cheap woods. But, after going through oak it began to break down. After that, I just bought a 12 volt drill to do the job.After a few months the handle broke. Opted for a real drill this time."
3,Manual Drill,The concept was great. It worked great for a while.... The internal gears must be plastic because they're slipping now. I wish it would have lasted a little longer. I did get the job done though and it did only cost $10 so that was good.
3,not for any serious work,"This will work fine for light duty work such as drilling holes for putting a screw in the wall to hang a picture frame. But if you try anything more strenuous than that, be warned: I managed to strip the gears inside, they are clearly not made of metal but of plastic. Whats more, the drill seems to be hermetically sealed; I was not able to open it up to try to fix it. You might be better off with an old fashioned metal-gear hand drill (such as the Stanley Hand Drill). The kind grampa used to have (and the kind grampa used for his entire life without it ever breaking on him). I'd choose metal gears over plastic gears any day. Even for a light duty hand drill (which, if you dont have a power drill, you're doing light duty work by definition!)."
2,total disappointment,"Drill did not come with attached bits as per photo. I intended to drill twelve 1/8"" holes during the first use and by hole number eight the gears were slipping. Bought one of these 10 years ago and it still works flawlessly. This one is junk."
5,Great drill,"I already have one, and I bought this one as a Christmas gift for my daughter. She had an opportunity to use mine earlier this year and really liked it. The Fiskars hand drill is easy to use, is extremely dependable, and very durable. It drills through everything from dry wall to aluminum with little effort."
5,"Nice drill; ""Pistol"" grip makes it more comfortable to use.","This hand powered drill is nice for times when a ""power"" drill is too much; the handle is a comfortable grip and makes it easy to use. It should work with the ""Black and Decker"" bits I bought (see the other review)."
3,MUCH MUCH BETTER THAN WHAT I EXPECTED IT TO BE,"TWO BROTHERS AND A CLOSE FRIEND ARE DRUG DEALERS IN WASHINGTON D.C. WHEN THEY PLAN TO TAKE OVER A DRUG KINGPIN'S NEIGHBORHOOD, A VIOLENT STREET WAR ESCALATES. MUCH MUCH BETTER THAN A LOT OF THE OTHER HOOD MOVIES THAT WAS RELEASED IN RECENT YEARS. THE ACTING AIN'T TOO BAD AND THE PLOT AIN'T TOO BAD EITHER. I ONLY PAID $7.00 FOR THIS FILM AT CIRCUIT CITY AND I MUST SAY, THIS WASN'T REALLY A WASTE OF MONEY COMPARED TO SOME OF THE OTHER HOOD MOVIES I'VE BOUGHT. IF YOU'RE IN THE MOOD FOR A NO HOLDS BARRED GANGSTA MOVIE THAT'S ENTERTAINING, THEN CHECK THIS ONE OUT NOW."
3,Could this be Tarij P. Henson's first movie?,"I remember seeing this flix years ago in the barbershop. I could never remember the name of it until recently. I watched it an noticed a young Tarij P. Henson (Academy Award winning actor). I may have out-grown this flix and its subject matter, but as a collector of Black cinema, you can not go wrong with this one. Being from DC, I did recognize a few of the actors other than those from the go-go scene. I would not recomend this for any pre-teen, due to the languge, sex, violence and drug content."
3,An undershirt,"I was disappointed to open this and find it's an undershirt, a ribbed ""A-shirt"" which is not what the picture looks like when you zoom in. I was looking for a smooth cotton tank top for exercising in, not an undershirt. If I had read more closely I would have seen the word ""rib"". As an undershirt, I'm sure it's fine, but I have plenty of those for a lot cheaper than thirty bucks. This is being sent back, but at least it's Amazon, so I know I can order with confidence."
2,Not so good,"I wasn't thrilled over this book! sorry... I felt it was the LONG way of doing the math when there are shorter ways to get the same answer! Also-I felt for the money the book wasn't chock full of the IV med math info. I needed. It was missing a How To do IV math concerning when there is a time change to the infusion, which should have been included."
5,Griffith is the Boy King of Poets,"Read this book. And if you do, you'll be one of six or seven lucky people who have! I have wasted my life. . . ."
5,"Fantastic, featherweight, durable, waterproof, wonderful","This is so much better than a rack. Put in your phone, camera, sunblock, kleenex, car keys, wallet, and maps. It fits modern road bikes and most other bikes too. It can also act as a helpful fairing to the wind, so that this item can help instead of hinder during a headwind. Nice feature set and so light weight that climbing/sprinting features of your bike are kept intact."
4,good item,"The bag is small and fits easily without flopping all over the place when I ride. The zipper opening is under a flap that makes it harder to pull things out of the bag, but this is a minor issue and not a problem to the point where I would not use the bag. I would not hesitate to recommend it to others. For its size you can get quite a bit in this bag. Niagara Cycle ships quickly, too, which is always a PLUS."
5,Great bag for the money,"This bag fit my needs for an old school type seat bag made with modern material. It matches two other Avenir bags I had for years on my 20yr old bike perfectly. Its well made, hangs right and is of a good size without getting in the way. Shipping from Niagara was very quick."
5,Excellent for low voltage components,"This item is just as described. The material and construction are very good. It probably is not appropriate for high-voltage house wiring components, because the tape is thinner and narrower than most electrical tapes. However, it is perfect for low-voltage electronics components, and the multi-color rolls help distinguish the leads."
2,not user friendly,"If I had known how cumbersome it would be to load songs and how poorly written the instruction manual was, I would not have purchased this item, which is now fuctioning fairly well after too many hours of preparation."
4,"good, but could be better","This collection was reasonably amusing. The selection of characters was diverse, and there was an appropriate mixture of both bawdy and ""toilet"" humor. However, I kept getting the feeling that I was reading second-hand tellings of the Norwegian classics of Asbjornsen and Moe. This collection truly pales by comparison to the high degree of art evidenced in the A&M; stories.By the way, why did the designers of this book choose a paper-bag-colored cover?"
3,"Not bad, but could be so much better","I haven't gotten too far in on this one yet, I've read the lengthy introduction which talks a great deal about the editor's mother growing up on Bornholm, a Danish island. But there was some interesting information about the collectors of Swedish folklore that are presented in the book. Its paperback, but not bad quality. The illustrations are reproductions of original works from various archives throughout Sweden, but all in black and white and mostly pen and ink sketch, not a favorite of mine. I've read a couple of the entries under animal stories and they have thus far been very, very short. But I'm looking forward to completely immersing myself in Swedish folk tales very soon. But if you only want to buy one book of this type, choose Swedish Folk Tales with illustrations by John Baur. Now that's one to pass down through the generations, just lovely!"
3,"Good story, but a bit slow moving..","I did enjoy the story and acting as I felt some of us have ""been there done that"" to some extent. However, for me I kept wanting to speed it up and also to give it more humour."
4,Is It Just Me?,"Good story line. Typical gay story of boy Meets boy but does not have the courage to tell the one he loves the truth. Nothing new, but still a good flick!"
2,What the ....,"I know this flick is a light-hearted comedy aimed at, perhaps, uplifting cynical gay men in metropolis, but still.... a hunky Texan, a struggling newspaper columnist... is this for real?..."
3,IT IS JUST YOU!!!!!!!!! GET HELP!!!!!!!!!!,"Why do Gay Movies deals So Much with Super Low Self Esteems!!! Blaine is an Uber Wimp with Chronic Low Self Esteem, Chronic Low Self Worth & he's Irritatingly uptight!!! I do like the Actors, didn't find the Movie Not Romantic instead I find 3/4 of the movie exhaustingly retarded!!!I really dislike too many Gay Loser Characters in Movies, it's very Tiring! We need more Realistic Humanistic Gay Characters in Gay or Straight Movies....If Blaine was a Real Person in Real Life, he seriously need a Big Dose of Xanax & Major Anti Anxiety meds grounded in his Coffee!!!!"
2,ouch,"Well, that was pretty bad. The actors were okay at times, but the script was a mess. The production value was so low. I hate to be negative about the film, but it was painful to watch. I don't know why there are so many positive reviews. Maybe the reviews referred to the actors being cute."
3,"Nice, not more than that","""Is It Just Me"" is another story of a person who seeks love and thinks he can't find it because he is just an ordinary guy, not very handsome and not very smart, and during his search for love makes the most stupid mistakes. if this was a story about a woman in search for her man, it probably would have been very boring. The fact that this is a gay movie makes it a little more than that, but not enough to make it fly."
4,pretty str8 forward and entertaining,"Not sure why the guy had difficulty meeting guys...he was handsome, intellectual and smart unlike his roommate but like they say, nice guys finish last so I guess that was the case. I liked it"
3,"Go on, take a chance.","From the impossibly cute love interest and nerdy protagonist to the supportive but tough, fag hag and wise old gay owl, this movie is full of familiar characters and plot lines. Plus it takes a little too long to get going. That said; this movie is fun! I laughed, I cried, and felt good about it when the credits rolled. So unless you're uber critical (not that there's anything wrong with that) this is a fun little romp. Just pop it in and enjoy."
4,Zinccccccc,This zinc is great. The taste is terrible. It's not bad to the point where you can not swallow it but it isn't a softgel so you're subject to the less than appealing taste. Just have water by hand and its not too bad.
3,More inspiration than information,"After being an 'in-town' motorcyclist for several years and looking towards getting into more long distance trips, I found most of the information in this book pretty fundamental (for any travel guide) and the author's ""my way is the best way"" attitude a bit off-putting.As others have stated, most of the book is anecdotes and travel logs with interesting pictures of far away lands (ironically, most of the captions are about how the subject of the picture endured some hardship 'the next day'). While the pictures and stories make a fine inspiration for adventure riding, the sub-title ""Everything you need to know"" is a bit misleading."
1,"it should be titled ""common sense things you should already know if you own a motorcycle.""","This book really only demonstrates common sense things you should already know if you own and ride a motorcycle. If you don't know this stuff, you really should just walk wherever you go.Throughout the book, I was wondering what decade it was written.It was a waste of money."
2,Touring review,"Motorcycle Touring:If you are not going to plan an around the world tour on a dual purpose bike, this book will only be entertaining and not informative.The tips that are suggested can be found in other publications that are specific to you needs.The stories of world travels are interesting/entertaining, just not very helpful."
3,nice concept,"Bova probably has never met anyone like his central character - the characterization feels a bit dry and intellectualized. I did enjoy the concept behind the book and think that there is a potential model for criminal rehabilitation here, and I'm sure that is what drove Bova to write this. It is a light novel - more of a sketch than a fully fleshed out book lengths story. I wish he had put more into the story and characters, but it holds up quite well nonetheless."
4,Jr High School,"I remember reading this in junior high school, in the 70's. Sort of 1984/Prisoner-esque thing, involving young adults. I liked it a lot, but all I can remember, now, is a) He hurled things at ""the plastic screens"" (spot on), and b) It was confiscated by my science teacher (because I was probably reading it in class) and never returned and how ironic is that."
5,Vote for Larry,my son needed it for a school reading assignment. enjoyed reading it.great price. thanks.i have done buying nere before.
1,worst CD-R i have ever seen,"please dont buy the cds .The cds have no label on the top.These are the worst cds i have ever seen .These can be used for storing data but for the ones who is looking to write music files on these discs ,these are the worst.I would have rated this as zero , but there is no zero in the column provided."
1,Errors reading,"First off, my Lite-on DVD-RW wouldn't even recognize the cds. My old Verbatim 32x CD-RW will burn without errors, but when I play the mp3 cds in my cd player, many songs skip like crazy. Bad media, dont waste your time with these."
1,Free after rebate for a reason,"The other reviews are correct. You can't tell which way is up with these disks; there is no label on them just two shiney sides. After two coasters, I succeeded in burning one at 4x. I don't have much faith in the disks but they should be ok for low critical uses like burning CD to listen in the car. I usually have real good luck with cheap media like Kypher but these are the worst I've seen."
1,terrible,"half of the discs are duds, and i doubt the ones that burned correctly will last long. given the risk of data loss, i wouldn't use these discs even if amazon paid me to take them."
1,These discs are garbage - They fail most of the time.,I'm so frustrated with these low quality disks that I have to take all my courage to write this review. So much time was wasted to save a few bucks! They keep failing with my Plextor PX-712A 3 out of 5 tries!
5,This product rocks,If you are into great steaks or wild game then this is the product for you. I was given my 1st one as a gift and had a problem with the original lid after contacting the vendor they took care of the problem and overnighted me a new one. After the new lid arrived it has been bullet proof and a GREAT product. Since then I have purchased 3 additional units and have given them as gifts. Everyone that has received them loves them for steaks and vegetables etc....Long story short you cant go wrong with this company or products!!
5,Eastman's MariVac Food Tumbler works miracles,"I love to barbeque and smoke marinated meats. Before I got this Eastman MariVac Food Tumbler, I would have to soak my meats for two days in the refrigerator to get the level of flavor I sought. With this Food Tumbler, I get that flavor in under 20 minutes. What a difference! This Eastman Food Tumbler works miracles."
2,Doesn't last,"The first Reveo I got was broken when we unpacked it. A replacement was shipped promptly, but now the same part in the lid that was broken in shipment, has broken again. It's a great premise, and I suppose it works well, but the fact that the lid is broken (again) after less than 20 uses makes me believe it has a fatal design flaw. Yes, the mfr has a one year warranty, but this is too pricey to only last a year, and too much hassle. I prefer my gadgets to be trouble free."
5,Magnificent Tenderizer and Flavorizer,"The Reveo tenderizer and flavorizer works wonders for me. I bought a slab of inexpensive chuck roast, perforated it, rubbed tenderizer on it, stuck it into the Reveo tumber with some marinade I wipped up, and tumbed it for 40 minutes. I grilled it to medium rare. This steak was perfectly tender, juicy, and bursting with flavor. Prime filet mignon at five times the cost could not have been better. It's easy to use and clean up. It's expensive at $200, but this little machine pays for itself in one month. I used it now about 40 times. Each with the same lovely result. I hate contraptions, but this wonder works."
4,Fast Marinades & good support,"I love to BBQ and this machines is made for this. It has allowed me to on the spur of the moment decide to defrost some meat and throw it in the marinade machine. lamb, chicken and steaks work well.I broke off the pump insert inside the lids (my fault) and with one call it was replaced no questions asked. Thats service.It was a great Dad's gift."
4,Expensive - look at alternatives,"Having had a couple of the first home marinating units (Minute Marinizer) and a few years ago having a discussion at the local butcher's over the advantages of tumbling units, I bought the much less expensive AGS countertop marinizer. It has deeper vanes on the inside for tumbling, and is a manual unit. It was just as well built. I was given a reveo for helping out a friend. Both seem to do the same job - but the AGS cost me $70 each. Thane also has a manual unit that I saw on TV for $60. It works, but there are cheaper alternatives. In any case - I can't live without a tumbling unit now for meats. I still keep the Minute Marinizer (non-tumbling) for softer fish that seem to sometimes come apart in the tumbler."
2,I'm a professional reviewer and there is a problem with this machine,"Just FYI: the machine itself works well. If you plan on using it several times a week forget it. The plastic lid is made out of a material that cracks. I have personally reviewed TWO of these units and both units lasted less than 6 months (we got a replacement the first time). The machine part is solid, the motor is solid, what happens is the lid cracks and it can no longer hold the vacuum. The media rep we got the machines from was notified about the issue.Save your money and get the cheaper Marinade Master it lasts forever (I've had mine for 6 years) and that's what you want in the kitchen, a useful tool that you can rely on."
1,Junk,"I never have left a review before, but this is a new low. I was excited, even with this price tag. First use, it was working for 10 minutes, then it stopped turning. I was under the 5 LB food limit, so it doesn't make sense. Okay, I tasted the meat after cooking and it was not better than a plastic bag marinade.Please, please, do not purchase this."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!!,"Waste of Money! This is a piece of CRAP! DO NOT BUY IT! Bad quality & the only time taylor is in it is when there are interviews of her from youtube! DUMB, its basic info about Taylor and two random people talk about her and analyze her relationships badly. Also, awful background music!!! No one would like this video!! I LOVE TAYLOR & was so excited for this, & EXTREMELY disappointed when i received it!"
2,Looks like a high school project,"This DVD is not put together very well and is definitely not from anyone associated with Taylor Swift (which is to be expected from the ""Unauthorized"" in the title). The formatting is incorrect for much of the live footage that has been added in and is low quality. The electronic background music is not particularly appropriate for DVD about a country singer and gets somewhat irritating pretty quickly. It does have some interesting information about Taylor Swift, but on the whole it seems like a mediocre high school project."
1,"Dont waste your money, honestly","I was pretty excited to recive the dvd in the mail, i was expecting, idk a DOCUMENTARY by her. But it isnt really, Some guy is narrarating and they have clips of her from other interviews and toss it in the film. And 2 random girls talk throughout the ""documentary"". Oh and in like 10 minutes of the thing he says the ""Dixie Twins"" rather than the ""Dixie Chicks"". Rediculous. Dont waste your time, or money on this ameteaur crud. Oh and it also has fuzzies throughout out the film like old movies. Ugh rediculous."
1,Dumbest thing I have EVER watched!!!,"If you are planning on buying this movie, STOP!!!!!It looks like it was made by a thirteen year old messing around on her dads computer. Actually, I take that back, I think a thirteen year old could have done much better!!!!To start off, the quality of the film sucks, and it makes you feel like your attending some amateur hour movie showing.The audio also stinks, it's an annoying techno type beat that NEVER STOPS!!!!!All the information is stuff that everybody already knows, it is simply a waste of time!This movie isn't worth 1$ let alone 15$"
5,OEM Quality at a much better price.,The fan clutch on my Previa was going out. So I decided to get a new one. My observation on Beck Arnley parts is they buy from the same manufacturer as OEM. The comparison between both the old fan clutch and the new one was none. When I want OEM quality without the OEM price I purchase BECK ARNLEY products. You will not be disappointed.
3,Interesting for a look at Maugham's later writings.,"A strange little book and, I believe, Maugham's last novel. Religious overtones make this story interesting enough, but 3/4's of the way through, the story seems to take a polar shift as if written by a completely different writer! It ultimately disappoints and remains interesting only to diehard or curious fans of Maugham."
3,A good read,"An interesting book, based on 16th century Spain. Maugham skillfully combines fact and fiction, transporting the reader to a time long ago when burnings at the stake were a commonplace occurence. Catalina is a beautiful girl, crippled by an accident. Forsaken by her lover, she is desolate - when her prayers are literally answered by the appearance of Virgin Mary, bearing a cryptic message which ultimately leads to a miracle cure. From a poor nobody, Catalina becomes an overnight celebrity. What happens then is the rest of the story."
5,"painfully honest, profound, a keeper","Sudie is one of the books I recommend to all my friends and then loan out with trepidation. What if they don't give it back? This and Alice (also by Flanigan)are both out of print so my copies can't easily be replaced. Sudie is wonderful, first of all, because its voice is so southern, so trusting and so incredibly authentic. A friendship between a black man and a white child are the perfect contrast to the ugliness of prejudice & abuse. Flanigan is a courageous woman with a voice that needs to speak more often. I keep hoping that her long silence means she is taking her time with another great book. I'd love to hear from the author."
4,A must for any fans of Conan!,"This book is very funny, and Conan O Brien fans will appreciate it, but personally, I don't think it's worth the cover price. If you can get it used, go ahead! The Amazon used prices are rockbottom. If I paid the full price..., I'd probably have given it 2-3 stars.The humor here is great. Not all of the In the Year 2000 lines are funny but a lot are. I dont know if people who arent too familiar with Conan would like it, but fans surely will.Again, get it used...but get it!"
3,Has a lot of room for improvement,"The Vivonic software works well, let me preface this review with that statement. It does what it promises. However, the serious fitness guy/gal is going to want more. I want links to fitness programs (i.e., Asimba's pay services (not just the wimpy free ones that are listed on the Vivonic web site), or eDiet's programs, etc.) In addition to the lack of connectivity the software needs a better list of foods and their caloric, fat, protein, and carb composition. And, it doesn't take snacks into consideration. You have to add snacks to your breakfast, lunch, or dinner numbers in the software to count them. We need a Vivonic Pro version, this one gets useless really fast if you're serious about tracking your food intake and exercise regiment. How about some upgrades? I'm pretty sure the website hasn't been updated since I bought this software 8 months ago. Let's go guys! Let's get that rating up to 5 stars!"
4,80% There...but it's a big 20% missing.,"Excellent functionality. Easy to use, easy to work on the desktop and Palm. Great Simple Graphing and Charting.Inadequate reporting. You cannot print your exercise or nutrition journal/logs --- only view on the screen. You cannot trend diet or exercise information over time...for example if your performance improves, or goes down, or body metrics.No updates to product in over a year."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! There is NO tech support!,"I purchased this product and I have yet to get it to sync properly with my Palm. I am knowledgeable with computers and have had several ""gurus"" look at it with no help. Whenever I sync with my Palm, all customer meals are deleted. I have emailed tech support - receiving a response 2 weeks later with the exact same software that I installed. Absolutely NO help. They are no longer a part of Intel (sold 2 years ago) and are still marketing under Intel w/no phone number or address listed (all www registration, phone #, and addresses point to Intel). I have contacted Intel and they are going after Vivonic demanding a cease and desist from them to remove Intel from the packaging and registration. The program - if it worked would be great. But frankly having no tech support doesn't make this software worth buying."
2,Disappointing,"Sucked in by the cute print ads in a few magazines, I really wanted to fall in love with this software and have it be just what I needed to keep track of my eating and my workouts. The software is a great idea but the implementation is lacking. I have found the interface on the palm to be a little cumbersome, and I don't like the fact that I can't take any notes next to my workouts."
1,Insufficient product for tracking even most basic nutrition,"I didn't like this product because it doesn't offer strong analysis tools to show the levels of vitamins, carbs, fats, sugars and protein in my diet over time. The lack of analysis capabilities makes it hard to improve your diet because you don't know what you're getting too much or too little of, you just know your total caloric intake. I do recommend another software product called LifeForm (for PC only, not Palm) which is much better for helping you understand the diet and level of excercise you need to maintain to lose weight. I've successfully lost and kept off 10 pounds using LifeForm."
1,Couldn't even get it loaded.,"Wellllll... I downloaded the Palm demo version from the website to see how this would compare to DietLog. (I was looking for a program to use on the PC AND the Palm.) I double-clicked on the icon on my desktop and followed the on-screen instructions. Supposedly this was to have put the correct file in the Install tool. Not at all. I tried this several times (I don't know why) and it never worked. I wish there was a zero-star rating, I feel like even a one-star rating is too high. DietLog is far superior for tracking food intake. (Breakfast, Snack, Lunch, Snack, Dinner, Snack) The only thing DietLog doesn't have is a version for the PC."
2,Is Vivonic defunct?,"I used this software with my Handspring Visor and liked it. I recently upgraded to a Palm Tungsten T and it turns out the software won't work on Palm OS 5.0. So I tried to get ahold of Vivonic...and they are gone. As if they never existed. The web site is shut down, the doors and windows are boarded up and nobody is home without so much as a press release. Do not purchase this software if you are running Palm OS 5.0 or if you care about future support."
2,New Palm? No Vivonic,"Like some of the other customers here, I've been using Vivonic (happily) for about two years but when I installed it on my new Tungsten C...nothing. ""Tech Support"" via the Vivonic site produces no response. It's a great program if you're using the Palm OS 4.0 or less, but not compatible with the newer models."
1,Useless With New Palm,This was a good program but has not been updated since 2000 and is not compatible with newer Palms. Website support does not respond.
1,Wrong.,"I lived with vaginal pain till my mid 20s when I discovered that physical therapy, specifically pelvic pain myofascial physical therapy could and did heal my pain. so my years of thinking it was all in my head were wrong. What I had was vestibulitis, vulvodynia and muscle spasms.Please google Rhona Kotarinos for more information."
1,when a womans body says no to sex: understanding and overcom,"I lived with vaginismus up until I was 34 (I am now 35) and I cant imagine that reading a book alone can REALLY help you. For the reviewer who claims that the great women at the Womens Therapy Center are a joke, I dont think you know what youre talking about. They helped me and so many other women overcome this condition, they truly saved my life, and I'm sure I can speak for the other women Ive met there who have said the same. Most women that suffer and have suffered from vaginismus understand that its impossible to ""cure"" yourself. The women at WTC know what they are doing and they are educated, kind, incredible women. Im sorry that you feel that they are a ""joke"", it seems that you have looked for answers on this condition for a long time, trust me they have the answers. I wish you luck."
1,Great Titles/ Poor Content,"Chorafas book is tedious to read. The titles are excellent, but the majority of the time I found the content under the title poorly researched, off the subject or focused only on one insignificant point instead of the subject title."
5,"Hello, LuLu","We bought this book for our daughter when she was 12 months old and began reading it to her. She absolutely loved it and wanted us to read it to her over and over again. We also purchased the other books in the LuLu series all of which she liked. But, Hello LuLu is her favorite. One year later, she is 24 months old and still enjoys the book. We have even bought an extra copy of the book to put in her hope chest so that she will always have her favorite childhood book on hand. This book will become a classic!"
5,Great product,Bought this to replace my Targus universal adapter which I bought for $80 and which gave out after 3 months. Immediately on opening this felt like a more sturdy product with tighter connections and less individual parts. Overall a good buy with the option to get it overnight.
2,OK....,"I use this wheel when Im working as a police officer, and when I measure building for my cleaning business. I have seen way better products that cost more money, but for the money its okay, not bad at all. It looks and feels very very cheap! Sometimes the wheels may roll a few feet and the numbers wont count. Other than that, I guess its okay, I wouldnt buy it again at all."
5,Worth the read,"awesome book,very empowering and helpful. I personally couoldnt put it down,the positive reinforcement was inspiring and refreshing in spirit as well as mental"
3,Not comprehensive,"I purchased this book to help me in the incorporporation process of a C-corp, and must say that while it does provide a lot of information, it's far from being sufficient in taking you step by step through the process.Just when you think you'll be able to pull this off with his guidance alone, Finck will tell you to ""get an attorney experienced in security matters"", rather then going deeper into securities laws, or at least mentioning what Regulation D, Rule 504 is. (Not that it's his fault, but after meeting with 5 business lawyers that a small business could afford, the advice proved hard to follow as well!)Truth is, the process itself is more complicated than can be covered in just 126 pages. The rest of the book is allocated to forms, at least one of which has a mistake in it. Finally, I wouldn't call the forms CD complete without the pages of a Corporate Kit. How hard would it be to include a stock ledger?"
4,At last!,"I grew up in England, where this film was called ""The Admirable Crichton"" after the JM Barrie play on which it's based. ""Paradise Lagoon"" is such a boring and misleading title for a story that's about the British class system in Edwardian times.Be that as it may, as I get older I often find the treasures of my youth have faded, but not this film. I have been trying to find a copy of this film for many years and I was not disappointed. The only thing that has changed is my appreciation of the ending, which is much better now than when I was 18; Crichton had to marry the Tweenie and not the aristocrat, despite the passion - marriage is more than just that. At 66 you know that much better.As to the movie making - I had expected the production values would have faded, but no! This is a fine film at all levels."
5,Why is it Pan & Scan?,"Every performance in this movie is flawless BUT It was shot in widescreen and is now altered for reasons beyond my comprehension.The ocean scenes as observed from the island were breathtaking, but now appear as if the viewer were standing in a wading pool in the backyard. It WAS my favorite movie of 1957 and in my lifetime top 20 and I am 79 years old and a movie buff from age 4. If you have never seen this film before, you will love it,even in its distorted version!"
4,Wow! A Revelation! And the Price!,"Superb, crisp sound and intelligent piano playing, equally crisp and equally fine. I would be happy with this as my only Chopin recording. At the super-low price, I plan on making it a holiday stocking stuffer. A recording you can't lose on and, better yet, will enjoy immensely."
5,A great opera for adults as well as children,"Regrettably Hansel and Gretel has acquired a reputation as an opera for children. Yes, the title characters are children (sung by adult sopranos) and children often find this opera more appealing than most other operas, but Hansel and Gretel is a great opera which should appeal to people of all ages, if they will listen to it without bias. Personally, I think it's one of the half dozen or so greatest operas ever written. Humperdinck was a student and devotee of Wagner and was heavily influenced by him, but he managed to express the best elements of the Wagnerian style on a human scale. Even people who regard Wager's operas as long and tedious should find Hansel and Gretel quite beautiful and appealing. This is a very good performance. If you love great operas, please get Hansel and Gretel and listen to it without any preconceived notions."
5,awesomeee!!!,"This is an awesome cd, it has good screaming and good melodic singing, with some great guitarwork and breakdowns. The singing sounds emo but it is strictly melodic hardcore and I highly suggest checking it out if you are a fan of From Autumn To Ashes, Atreyu, Poison the Well, or Silverstein. I was not disappointed with this release and I'm sure you will not be either."
2,Disappointing,"I enjoyed Mr. Podrug's first book and was looking forward to reading more of his work, however, I was disappointed in this book."
2,smaller than they look online,"I just got these today. They are really hard, which is great for babies who like to bang them against the paper. I guess the only thing I am thrown off by is how small they are. I thought they would be bigger. Mine were also just thrown in the box. All the crayons have marks from the other colors all over them, they definitely didn't come the way the picture shows. I wish they had taken more time to package them properly. I think the price is definitely too high considering they are just crayons but if they don't break as easily as other crayons it might be worth it. I'm sure my baby will enjoy them anyhow."
3,Tubes are very small...,"I havent used this product yet, but the tubes are very small.. they're about 1/2"" thick & 2-1/2"" long. Looked bigger in picture. I was expecting more for the price."
5,Worked as expected,This product worked well with my wife's new crossbow. I would recommend it to anyone needing lube wax for the strings on their bow equipment.
4,As described,"Product was as described. Hard to mess up bow lube wax, so it is adequate. It seems like it will work well."
4,Good product,Good product. Could come in a larger tube for what you need to use. Does what it should. Will buy more
3,bow wax,good product but not worth the price can get a better price at any store that sells sporting goods i gave it three stars for the price only
3,lube wax,It arrived quickly and it was easy to use and its. Will order again or even other products from the same vender.
3,Must Have,"Ya if you shoot the crossbow, I bought a Jackal by Barnett you will want this stuff to put on the string and guides....its like chapstick!"
3,I'ts chapstick sized..,I thought it would be bigger..its just a little longer than chapstick..it measures from the bottom to the top of the cap of chapstick and then put a cap on that. It seems like it'll work good though. I haven't opened the pack yet. I'll be sure to post if it works like a chapstick and if it be cheaper to buy that instead.
5,Very good product.,This wax works very well with my bow. They come in a pack of 3. The only thing I don't like is the tubes are very small.
5,It's wax,I use the was as instructed and to date have not had a problem with my crossbow. Though I will say it's just wax as far as I can see.
4,Great investment!,"Ok, so I am a novice with the crossbow. I bought one and the string broke after only 6 shots. That is when I learned that the string and rail have to be waxed. I bought this item (and replacement strings)and was really suprised at the difference it made. The cost was among the lowest that I found but I have fired my crossbow more times than I can count after replacing the initial string and am still on the (1st)replacement string and the first tube of lube wax! As always, shipping was better than expected. I have only two complaints.....the first is that I bought too many extra strings and the second is that one tube probably won't last forever. Great investment for someone that likes to use their crossbow a lot."
4,Barnett String Wax,As far as string wax goes it is top of the line! Quality easy to use wax. The only downside to it is the fact that it is as small as chapstick....wish it was larger! Other than that it is perfect!
5,A Bitingly Funny Novel About The Vietnam War,"Written by Marc Leepson, book reviewer for The VVA VETERAN, a publication of the Vietnam Veterans of America, June/July 2002 issue:""Don Truitt's THE ORIGINALS is a bitingly funny semi-autobiographical Vietnam War novel that follows the misadventures of a group of troops at the fictional 516th AG as they wend their way through their year in a war zone--in this case a rear area at Cam Ranh Bay."""
1,Hogwash,"There are too many Israelis and Israel-apologists who seem unable to acknowledge that criticism of Israel might not be anti-Semitism, but might actually be based on a legitimate and reasonable rejection of Israel's destructive attitudes toward Palestine. Israel was once a noble project - the Jews deserved a homeland, and Israel's defense of itself in 1948 and 1967 was merited. But Israel needs to remember that the Palestinians too deserve a homeland. Israeli nationalists just cannot accept that Israel might now reasonably be considered a pariah state, and that Europeans might just have a case. As a European, I am proud that Europe is standing up to Israel - someone has to when the Americans seem unable to take the lead. This book is propaganda, and does nothing to contribute to a solution of Israel's problems. Hard-core conservative Israelis will love it, but no-one else will take it seriously."
5,From God's Own Heart,How does one rate such a genuine love for God? I stumbled across this CD a couple of days ago by chance or perhaps by the grace of God. Rocks Won't Cry is a wonderful collection of honest cries of praise to God from a young heart. It's acoustic worship at it's best - humble and inspiring. Thank you Shane!
1,If you have a gem of knowledge don't set it with rusty nails on plywood,Technically it looked good and may have been great. The chief problem was the spottiness of the print. Where the character we at the thinnest the print was missing. I have experienced many early texts. They require the eye strain and this should be clearly printed. Wiley is a big name and I have not experienced this before. Please improve the quality. If this is an isolated run for kindle. It almost looked as if someone had photocopied the book by hand.These are my impressions. The quality of the text is found wanting.
1,Horrible quality,"I bought the kindle edition of this book so that I would not have to carry around a hard cover book. The text is difficult to read. It looks as if it has been scanned. Some words are broken into as much as three segments! Often parts of the letters are missing. For example, when a beta appears often the back of it is either very thin or missing entirely. I would not mind if Amazon was charging $10 for the book but they are charging upwards of $70 for the kindle edition of the book. For that price they should deliver a perfect file that does not make ones head spin every time they try to read it. If necessary they should retype the whole book!"
5,Amazing,"Definately my new favorite band...Yellowcard comes very close but The Starting Line is AWESOME!! The Best Of Me is the best song ever written. I cant say enough about this CD its amazing. the guitars are awesome, very energetic, fun to sing with and just plain awesome. I love this band, and u should go buy the CD right now cause you are missing out on some of the best pop punk rock ever written."
2,Expected More,"Ken Vasoli graduated from my high school so all of you teeny bopping 12 year olds who run around screaming, ""Kenny,"" are full of it. This album is anything but what I expected from the band. If you want a real Starting Line sound drop by my house sometime and I'll show you some tapes I have of them playing local shows around here. You know, before they sucked. Ok, so they don't suck, but they were far better before they released this cd. Stay underground with songs like ""Greg's Last Day"" and the original ""Leaving."" Good Starting Line, unlike this album"
4,4 and a half actually,"Half for being bumblegumish. 4 and a half for actually making it not too bad. The lyrics are pretty good. The lead singer kind of scares me tho, but I;m supposed to judge the album, not the band. I guess you can say that it's pop punk. I disagree with it being pop tho. Punk is making music that relates to people's lives and making their own music (like playing their own instruments *cough* Avril *cough*).Anyhow, recommanded for all sorts of people, except""real punks"". And to those who want to make it popular by putting it on radios and overplaying it, STAY AWAY! You've ruined enough good music already!"
1,If You like Backstreet Boys or NSync this is for you...,"I cant believe I bought this crap its the worst cd ever do these guys think theyre punk? this cant even be called emo that would degrade that genre. This sounds EXACTLY like what the Backstreet Boys or NSync would sound like if they played instruments. I cant listen to more than 30 seconds of any song on here without turning it off and tossing the disc around like a frisbee. I gave the cd a chance believe me but my ears would probly start to bleed if i listened any longer. I wish my friend hadnt said this was good i wasted $13 Dont waste yours. Just trying to help. If you like Punk Rock Id suggest you get some NOFX,Rancid, Green Day, blink 182 (before Enema), Sum 41, Pennywise, Anti-Flag, The Misfits,etc. If you want emo Id suggest: Yellowcard,Dashboard Confessional and other stuff.Just dont buy this if you like punk or emo or even rock for that matter. Trying to save you some money."
2,kenny,"great music, great songs, very very bad frontman, and for that i take off 2 stars and only give the band 2 stars. all because of the freak factor that is kenny."
3,this review is pointless. i just wanted to ramble,"Punk is one of those words that gets tossed around so callously these days. When someone like Avril Lavigne gets labelled as ""punk"" because she wears a tie, you get a pretty good sense of how far away from the original meaning the word being used now is. At the same time, people get so wrapped up in the definition of the word that it becomes a punker-than-thou contest to even admit you like anything any more. Whatever. The Starting Line is pop-punk along the lines of New Found Glory, Blink 182, Midtown et al, you know, everything on the Drive Thru label. I personally enjoy this album immensely, but I feel pretty sorry for anyone who thinks this is what punk is about. You can't win 'em all I guess."
1,Astounding!,"Astoundingly bad pop + astoundingly bad punk = astoundingly bad pop-punk. It's pretty simple, kids."
2,More Fizz than Pop-punk,"I picked this CD up due to its Drive-Thru label...unfortuantely I was disappointed. Any fans hoping for anything along the lines of NFG, Finch, the Movielife, or SoCo should be warned. TSL's lyrics are mundane and their melodies uninspiring. And as for why TSL can become Drive-Thru's shining star, well you'll notice D-T's best move on to other labels (DC- Vagrant, SoCo-Geffen, etc). Try this one only if you're looking for some more pop in your life."
2,Homogenized by MTV,"This sounds the same as most of the other bands mentioned in the reviews, and not by accident. The entire genre is waiting for a new musical idea. If you like this style (Blink 182 etc), and you must because the labels hire reps to screen thousands of bands to pick ones that sound just like this, then this record is for you. If a band sounds different, the record label either will not sign them, or will put a producer on the record to homogenize it appropriately so that it sounds roughly the same as what has sold in the past. (That's actually why the compilations work so well). Punk is supposed to be about risk and raw and new. If you want the same 4 chords with the 4 note repetitive (but catchy) melody line, buy this. If you want something new, look elsewhere."
5,AWSOME,"this is one of the best CD's I have ever listened to. I can play it for weeks on end and I will discover more and more lines that are awsome. Personal Favorites: A Goodnights Sleep, Left Coast Envy."
4,Not too bad at all,"This CD is...good! Not great, but definately catchy. The...I don't know, maybe pre-teen/young teen crowd is most likely to like it. I think The Starting Line sounds a bit like New Found Glory, but...maybe for a younger audience. Good, catchy songs, but if you are easily annoyed with ""preppy punk rock"" they might all sound the same to you. Overall, I would suggest buying this CD."
4,These guys rock,Just buy this cd. The singing rocks. The guitars rock. The bass lines are ok. The drums rock. The lyrics rock. These guys rock.
2,This is NOT The Starting Line,"I've seen the starting line live and heard some of their stuff on compilation cds and let me say, someone ruined this disc in the studio. Drive-Thru records puts out some great stuff so I bought the Welcome to the Family compilation cd as soon as it came out. The Starting Line had two songs on there that were two of the best songs out anywhere, I just listened to them over and over. This CD sounds nothing like that and nowhere near as good as they sound live. They lost all of their rawness and energy and it sounds like someone put the songs together with a computer rather than four guys jamming with instruments. I listened to this CD a few times, hoping it would grow on me, but ended up selling it on ebay without even burning a copy to keep - it's THAT bad. Like I said, it's not the band, it's the fool that ruined it in the studio. Better luck next time guys. Want a great new Drive-Thru disc? Buy Allister's ""Last Stop Suburbia"""
3,under starters orders......,"Well i was waiting for this album for quite a while,and when i got it i thought it was awesome. But after a few listens you realise that it is distictively average. There are some good songs and i wouldnt say there are any awful ones but during the middle of the album it just sounds like one long song. The Starting Line need to work on some fresher ideas because i dont think they could hold up this style across 2 or 3 albums."
4,This IS Good Music,"This is a good CD. These kids always put out good music, and it makes me sick to hear people badmouth it because it isn't hardcore punk. Throughout this CD, you find good, honest music - they sing about what they want to. They are undeniably talented, and they shouldn't be denied credit simply because they play pop-punk. I'm not a ""pop-punk"" kid - I like Dillinger 4, Grey Matter, Modest Mouse, Ben Harper, Death Cab for Cutie, Outkast, Dr Dre - You name it, my music runs the spectrum from hardcore to pop, and these kids are as earnest and talented as any band in the hardcore genre which so easily insults them. I AM finding what feels right to me, and this just happens to be it."
4,"The Starting Line...New Found Glory rip offs,...or more?","I bought With Hopes Of Starting Over awhile back and wasnt to impressed, but Say It Like You Mean It is great, all the songs are good and are really catchy. They still sound like all the other drive thru artists(except for Finch cuz finch is the greatest band ever) but this cd is worth the money"
5,THESE GUYS ROCK,I got my CD Tuesday morning and I cant stop listening to it. Every track is awesome and Kenny's voice is just amazing. New Found Glory's got some competition in these guys. Keep the music coming.
5,Best CD Ever!,"this is literally my favorite CD from anybody...this is a pop/rock kind of CD and every song well produced...if you like their first EP (With Hopes of Starting Over) then you'll definitely like this, Leaving, Saddest Girl Story and Cheek To Cheek have been re-recorded from their old EP versions and i have to say they are phenomenal! But yes i will admit the CD is kind of repetitive but if you don't mind all songs to like The Best of Me (their first single) then i guarantee you will love this CD...this is well worth the money...hha in fact i'm listening to them right now! so what are you waiting for? go out and buy it!"
2,Homogenized by MTV,"This sounds the same as most of the other bands mentioned in the reviews, and not by accident. The entire genre is waiting for a new musical idea.

5,if u dont have this cd....go and buy it RIGHT NOW!!!,"all i can say is that this is one of my all time fav cds ever! great lyrics and vocals! best songs r:best of me---this is such a catchy song, you'll love it forevercheek to cheek----great lyrics, a lil weird at the beginning, but it's such a great songsaddest girl song---this is my fav song on the cd, mostly cuz the lyrics r so great!!!left coast envy---everytime i hear this song i think about the beach...i wonder y ;)all in all this cd should get 10 stars!!"
1,Spend your money on something better!,"First off, this cd is nothing great AT ALL. Many of the songs sound alike and are really annoying. The lyrics are weak, and the singer's voice isn't anything to go crazy over. The only song that is just okay is Up and Go. It has a decend beat and it's even kind of catchy. But if you're DYING to get the cd, borrow it from a friend or check it out at the library and burn it, cuz this lame cd is a huge disappointment!! If you want to get a good punk-rock cd, even Good Charlotte would be better than these losers!"
1,Pop-Punk: An oxymoron.,"I'll say this: If you like bands of this genre like Good Charlotte, I'm sure you'll like this CD. I made the mistake of picking it up... Now I want my money back. However, if you're looking for some real rock/punk, you're looking in the WRONG place. Pick up some Dead Kennedys or Bad Religion, ANYTHING but this. Take my word for it, unless you're some teeny-bopper 14 year old girl and like to pretend you're punk, ala Avril Lavigne, stay far away."
1,downward spiral,"this pop surgance has got to stop.this music is not good. at all.it's music for people who don't know what good music is.it's selling an image.drive-thru is hands down the worst label ever.they're ruining punk rock.flooding the scene with garbageplease boycott drive-thru, there's honest music out there.go find it, that's what punk rock is all about.finding what feels right to yourself, not just what a couple thousand people think is cool."
3,Good music...but have you seen the singer???,"Ok...the music is good for Starting Line. good vocals, good music, but i have grown to dislike them a lot because of one factor....look at the lead singer! he freaks me out man...especially in the 'best of me' video. i turned it off immedietly...horrible. once i saw him, his appearance ruined the music for me."
3,Another drive-thru sound alike,"One time I listened to a friend's drive-thru records mix. The first four songs were by four different bands. (Starting Line, NFG, Rx Bandits, and one other.) If I didn't know any better, they all sounded the same. All the guys who think they're punk because they die their hair and spike it. It's pathetic. Drive thru records is a pitiful excuse for anything close to punk. The only good bands that came out of there are Finch (who's MCA now) and the Early November. Hopefully they'll have the sense to switch too. This cd doesn't deserve the genre of punk, its more like hyper pop rock. If you want hyper pop rock with a bunch of guys singing in super high voices with lyrics reminising [what] they did last summer, buy this cd!(I'm not saying its a bad cd, I'm saying its not punk. I'll listen to STarting line if I'm in the mood of hyper pop rock.)"
5,Say it like you mean it ...,"i love all the songs they are all ace.Some song i feel like i totaly know what there on about.The vocals are rad take the vocals in ""best of me"" boy can he sing.plus not only do the vocals kick total ... but the drums and gutairs are off da hook dude!This cd totaly gets my 5 stars.I cant stop listing to the cd its like im addicted.If you have any good taste in music you will take my advise and buy this cd!!!Keep it going starting line you are the best.Plus Kenny is soooo good looking!"
2,More Whiney Little Kid Rockstars,"Modern music today is filled with stuff like this. Unoriginal teen girl friendly, power chord laced tripe. While some punky pop acts like blink182 and possibly even sum41 carry a sense of fun the starting line is only annoying with most of the songs being about some girl that broke these young boys hearts. Granted this kind of material can make for a good song but the music and vocals bringing this across also come off as annoying. The lead singer is whiny and unbearable. It pains me to think people in the future will look back on today's music and see this kind of music as indicitive of what we listen to today. The starting line does nothing original but hey neither does Fenix TX, Good Charlotte, New Found Glory or any other pop band so thats why they got 2 stars instead of 1. If you want to hear punk music go buy a millencolin or alkaline trio and leave this little kiddy rock to the teenage girls."
4,good stuff,"I think this CD is great if your into the pop punk. The Starting line is a great band, they have great lyrics in their songs and you can relate to them. I think that this CD is rare because i was able to listen through the whole thing without skipping over any song, in my opinion thats when i know something is good."
4,Entertaining book about meditation,"This book was a very entertaining story about the No Way Zen Center. Tofu Roshi and his two students' rivalries carry the story through instructive chapters and humorous accounts of their lives. Nonetheless, their spiritual journies move them along their paths. As Tofu Roshi says ""Life is like a washing machine-it is a transforming process. And like a washing machine, you do not always get out of it what you put into it."""
1,"DON""T BUY ANYTHING SHAQ",my review is simple i would give this a zero star but anyway. don't buy shaq stuff he has no talent expect on the court. he can't sing or rap or act. thanks for your time
3,What's up with this?,"Why is it that Jet discontinued production of this jointer when it fills a large market demand - 6"" open stand, light weight stationary, easier transported and modestly priced. Here on Amazon it receives very good reviews and in various internet chat rooms it's also extremely well received. I'd buy this jointer tomorrow but I can't locate one any more. I don't get it."
4,Beautiful as the TV show..,"One of the most pleasing facets of 'Providence' the TV series is the music, which is always 'just right' for the mood of the episode.This CD offers you some of the best of the tunes featured on the show, including two versions of 'In My Life' the series' theme.'Say Goodnight' by Beth Nielsen Chapman is particularly indicative of the musical sounds regular viewers associate with the beauty of the show itself. 'Con Te Partiro' by the great Andrea Bocelli is an added bonus as I see it, lending a different musical element to the caliber of the CD.There have been numerous times I have checked the epidsode guide online for the titles of some of the songs used on the show when I wasn't familar with the particular selection. With this CD you can have your own 'soundtrack' of the Providence music anytime you want."
5,I LOVE this CD!!,"This is the best Christmas present I recieved! I always loved the music on the show, and when they advertised the Cd, my DH bought it for me. It will keep you listening again and again. I am sad the show ended, but this will be a lasting tribute to one of my favorite shows."
3,"Chantal, not Shawn","The Amazon.ca review may confuse some people into thinking that Shawn Colvin sings the theme song at the beginning of the tv show. She does not. That is Canadian artist Chantal Kreviazuk. She's an amazing artist. This cd is worth it for her song alone. She also sings a beautiful, heartwrenching version of Leaving on a JetPlane for the armageden sountrack. I'm not a member of her fan club, but I do think she is an incredible artists. My empathy to fans of Providence 'cause its ending now. It was a good show."
5,Nice for my home and office collection,Nice addition to my home and office music collection. I may purchase more of these for birthdays and Christmas presents.
1,No Customer Service,This is a collection of DOS based computer games that should be compatible with your PC. You need to know what your doing to load this becasue Interplays customer service number is out of service. If you manage to find another number in the manual and leave a voice messege. It won't be returned. So your on your own with this product.
3,"They give their ""Point Of View"" so here's mine:","With an initial dash of grunge in the guitar in the first couple of songs and then a smoothing out and mellowing over the rest of the 10 songs and with the vocalist sounding not unlike Third Day's Mac Powell quite a bit this CD, which essentially feels like a rock CD but is in fact a praise and worship disc, would have benefitted from better production. Still not bad for what it is. The artists keep it lively and there is some good, enjoyable music on here with overt worship and outreach lyrical content. The acoustic steel string ""Glory Train"" is probably my favorite song on the disc (and really is where this feels like it could be a pre-Third Day CD; in fact, Third Day would probably have made ""Glory Train"" into a hit)."
2,Only the bad parts of the band so far,"Noisy, ugly, and mostly amateurish early punk release from the great band is seen hardly beginning to spread their wings on this adolescent outing. Short of a few interesting ideas the release is a throwaway for greater things to come."
2,"I'm in love with ATDI, but this ep is just too forgettable","Okay, first off, just let me get something off my back. Relationship of Command is their best album, hands down. I don't care about it's somewhat mainstream success. It is a landmark of an album and needs to be recognized as one. All their other albums (Aecrobatic Tenement, Vaya, In/Casino/Out) also have a very special feel to them. Sadly though, this has to be the worst offering by ATDI, and even sadder, one of THE worst albums you could possibly buy. I went through the trouble of special ordering it, just because I thought I would have been in on something. Honestly, when I found out that it came out after Aecrobatic Tenement I almost cried. How could they go from that to this? I also noticed that the back-up vocals sounded a bit different, maybe not Jim Ward in a couple of the songs. The melodies just don't have ANY special kick in them, but it's not a big deal cause ATDI will live on with their other albums. I'm saddened..."
2,No,"This is At The Drive-In's weakest album. It must appeal to more straight-on punks, since most of the other reviews seem pretty positive, but for a more casual ATDI listener, this album is awful. Having lost two of their members that they recorded ""Acrobatic Tenement"" with before this album, ATDI was at a low point, and it shows through musically. It sounds rough and incomplete, and much worse than ""Acrobatic Tenement"" and incredibly inferior to the following ""in-CASINO-OUT."" If you're obsessed with ATDI, or just like anything with a guitar, buy this album. Otherwise, buy their other four -- THOSE are excellent."
5,Gratitude for this BOOK!,This book is extrememly well written and flows quickly. It will keep you laughing and appreciating the shoes on your feet right now! This is a great snapshot for what it was really like in a by-gone era where the stories are starting to disappear.
4,grattitude for shoes,"The book was somewhat long at around 500 pages, but my interest remained strong throughout the book. I had a special interest as I am from the area described in the book. The book gave a great insight into life in the rural mountains of Western North Carolina from around 1930 through the fifties."
5,Gratitude for Shoes,"Excellent book on life in Macon County NC. Book clearly shows the determination, drive and survival skills of North Carolinas mountain floks."
4,love it,"I gave as a gift and my grandma was thrilled with how sturdy it was and what a ""good quality"" door handle I had gotten her. Thats good in my book considering thinks are crap these days compared to 80 years ago."
1,Warning...,"Buyer beware. Schlage used to produce high quality products. Search the net and you'll find they make nothing but junk now. I have a house full of these (brass version of this one) and I have replaced about a third of them in 8 years. When disassembled, I found I could bend the internal components between my thumb and index finger. If you want it to last, look elsewhere."
2,Um... ja...jamaica.,"We got this film in france and were blown away... by its oddness.I like this film but it doesn't make sense and barbie is somewhat gormless in it.Anyway, loved the dolls, couldn't comprehend the film."
2,ehhh..,"Went to (...) after my fujifilm died after 4 months- saw this gamera looks great- has that expensive touch to it only 128 so i thought why not?i take it home read the entire booklet and test things out.. my batteries were low within 10 minutes of testing! this camera eats batteries FAST, all cameras eat them but this is unbelieveably fast!the LCD screen is blurry and pixeled, when you view pictures on LCD its blurry until 5 seconds later it sharpen (i might have gotten a defect but it was the last in stock im not going through hassle)movie feature- awful! when you watch on your computer its INCREDIBLY blurry sound is very low you have to really crank up your speakers.i'm going to go for a sony or samsung."
3,"Takes Pictures, then Eats Batteries!","The camera works nicely and takes good pictures. Unfortunately, you can only use it for about half an hour before the batteries die. And don't even think about buying the camera dock with the rechargeable batteries... those batteries arrived dead on delivery and HP had no customer service number for me to call and no warranty card or information included. They say they have a 90 day warranty... good luck on getting any help. There must be better companies to buy from."
1,Dead camera and not enough money to get another one,I bought this camera and was so happy with it. I got married about 2 and a half months after I got it. After coming home and downloading the pics to my desktop I turned the camera off because it ATE a set of rechargeable batteries for a snack and burped them back at you. The next time I went to use my camera it would not turn on. I tried to take it back from where I bought it and it was day 91...you guessed it....they won't take it back. After contacting HP they said it would cost $140 to fix this hunk of plastic.....I didn't even pay that much for it. I will NEVER buy HP anything again. I thought they were a good name then a week ago my friends HP laptop literally smoked itself.....filled her whole apartment with smoke...way to go HP!!DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA!!
2,violence and nudity fans,"if you're into violence and partial nudity this is a must have, it brings them both in huge amounts, blood spitting boxing matches, awesome knockouts, topless girls and a good share of stupid wrestling freak acts are all inclusive, old fights."
2,"Looks nice, but not all functions work with all systems","Looks nice, the orange is dead on as far as Tennessee oranges go. I have comcast and after programming and reprogramming the remote, the 'enter' button doesn't work. So if I go through comcast's menus and find something I want to watch, I have to find my comcast remote to hit the enter button, which defeats the purpose of the remote since this is the most useful and used button. I leave the remote out in our den purely for decorational purposes."
5,Works Great!,"I have had other pill crushers, but they have all gummed up. When I needed a new one, I read the reviews on Amazon and purchased this one and its been great. Crushes pills very well without accumulating residue. I highly recommend it for anyone who needs a pill crusher."
1,didn't work for me,I found this works okay for larger pills but I am not able to crush the smaller pills that I need crushed also.
4,GOOD PRODUCT...,"This was a failed experiment for me. I will withhold my review. Still, it crushes the pills like it says it does, but it will take two or three times to get it pulverized."
2,Not impressed,"If your pill has a coating on it, this is not for you. It does mash the pill into a power, but it can't do anything with the ""skin"" or coating. If you swallow the skin like this...it sticks to your throat. You need something that grinds up the pill.Also...the plastic bottom hurts your hand. Comfort grip on the top but not on the bottom."
2,forgot other end,"The top of the crusher is nicely protected with soft coating, but they should have done the same for the bottom. I always have to use a towel on the bottom so it doesn't tear my hand apart."
1,Get a Coffee Grinder!,"I have used a variety of pill crushers-including a hammer...always hoping that the next one would be the best. I re'cd this one quickly, and it simply cannot pulverize my mom's pills. I was so bummed...but, I did read a review (and I so wish I could find it) about a man who used a coffee grinder to crush all his mom's pills. So-I thought I would try it too. I ordered the ""Krups 203-42 Electric Coffee and Spice Grinder with Stainless-Steel blades, Black"" from Amazon, and just recieved it. AMAZING! I did six pills at a time w/ no splitting and in less then 15 seconds...have pulverized pills. The grinder does cost $20, but so well worth it. If you do order it---after you have pulverized your pills, let it rest for a minute so all the ""pill-dust"" will settle. Truly, worth the $20!!!! And thanks to the reviewer who suggested this! :)Krups 203-42 Electric Coffee and Spice Grinder with Stainless-Steel blades, Black"
1,Not worth the money,I purchased this pill crusher because I was having extensive dental work done. I found this crusher to be awkward and hard to turn. I've found cheaper crushers that I like much better.
1,Not good at all,This product was very disappointing. The cheap pill crusher from Wal-Mart works much better. Very hard to hold and use.
3,Works well except on very small pills,I had to crush pills after surgery so I purchased this. It works very well on large pills but not so well on small pills. It seems the chamber allows too much room for the device to crush very small pills.
2,Pill crusher NOT,"I read the reviews before I purchased this product and all were positive, well they must've been crushing one pill at a time, I have to crush up all of my husbands meds 3 x's a day even after spliting them and only crushing a few at a time this product did not crush the pills enough for him to safely swallow. Good thing I have one with teeth that actually works or I'd be using a hammer and pliers, I do not recomend this for safely crushing pills it just looks cool and that's all."
4,Works well,This pill crusher does a good job. The bottom section needs to have some kind of rubber or other covering - it digs in to the hand when turning. I just use a towel which works fine.
3,Gets the job done,"This pill crusher has a very good design. It has lips on the top and bottom, allowing you to get lots of leverage to crush those hard pills. I only have a few complaints though.1) The bottom lips are a bit ""sharp"" to say, so you could scrape yourself if you're not careful2) This crusher doesn't actually ""pulverize"" pills as advertised. It crushes them effectively, but not into a powder.3) If you shake it while the crushed pill is inside, the pill powder will actually come out of the top a little bit. This is probably due to poor design around the seal.That's it. It does it's job. You just have to be a bit careful with it."
4,Ultra Pill Crusher (Pulverizer) By Apex Medical,"Good thing to crush Tibet pills. I use it every day. No complaints, exept one - it is not enough convinient to bear it in hand when crushing."
5,Perfect pill crusher!,Knob-style which fits very nicely in hand and has blue no-slip grips. Easy to turn (even with arthritis and carpel tunnel) and crushes to a very fine powder. My opinion is that it couldn't be any better than it is and I would recommend to anyone.
1,This hurt my hands to use,My son has a G-Tube. I bought one of these when my other crusher broke. The top is comfortable to use but the bottom hurts my hands. They should have used the same material on the bottom. We had problems with the powdered medication getting stuck up inside the crusher and then in the plastic grooves that the top spins on. We couldn't tell how much medication we were losing out of the crusher but it was a considerable amount. I returned the product.
4,At last!,"Finally a pull crusher that actually crushes -- and sometimes pulverizes -- a pill. I have tried various pill crushers over the years to crush meds for my son and daughter with special needs. This one is hands-down the best. I wish I had found it sooner. Now if only they could make the bottom a wee bit more comfortable on the hands, I'd give it 5 stars."
1,Fair but hard to use,"I take care of my invalid mother-in-law and go through pill crushers like crazy. I LIKE this pill crusher but wish the bottom was the same as the top. It cuts into my hand and with arthritis, it is painful to use. I went back to my old pill crusher."
2,"Sorry, this doesn't work well -- sending it back","I ordered this based on positive reviews on Amazon, but I was disappointed in the product. The design of the pill crusher has some pluses, with the top being easy to grip and turn, and it may work okay to crush two or three pills, but it doesn't work well to crush a number of pills and especially not large vitamins.There are no ""teeth"" on the element that pushes down on the pills, so you can't grind the pills by screwing the top. You have to depend on the brute force to smash the pills.I found it did not work as well as my old crusher, which both crushed and ground (if necessary). This item didn't fully crush the pills, so they did not dissolve in orange juice.It's an inexpensive item, and may work okay if you just need to crush a pill or two, but I'm sending it back."
5,Love it!!,"Best crusher on the market without a doubt. I tried some others and they did not work as well as this one. Very durable, good price too..."
5,Makes Crushing Pills an Easy Task,"I had been using a mortar and pestle to crush my cat's pills but wanted something smaller and more portable, since the mortar and pestle is heavy and bulky. This pill crusher turned out to be a very pleasant surprise and works perfectly. It's made of a thick and apparently durable plastic and the actual effort required to twist the device and crush the pills inside is very minimal. Crushing a pill into a fine powder is quick and almost effortless compared to using the mortar and pestle."
4,What a blog can do for you,"I enjoyed reading this collection of ""some of the best bloggers"". Actually, I think it was just some of the best blog entries they could find. Which is not to say they aren't good because I'm saying here I totally enjoyed the reading. Just don't forget there's more out there. After you get this book, don't forget to go to your local internet and browse!"
1,Bad copy of Warren B. Murphy themes,"Although it could have been a great yarn, the main character Michael Walker is abosultely unbelievable. How can a person who has been trained by the Army as a sniper, ergo for so-called black ops, be so uneffective and stupid!"
2,Shirt,"Not real crazy about this shirt. Don't like the feel or the fit. Didn't wear well at all. Underarm seam tore after about 6 months. Looks great, but I don't recommend this one."
4,Thorough and extensive facts; well-researched,"For the information that I needed, this book was very efficient. It was detailed perfectly and the language used was simple."
4,little tiny book,Don't be surprised when you get this book that it's tiny. Not what I was expecting (probably didn't read the fine print). I do enjoy it though.
4,Canon PG-50,"Works as advertised, so far. Canon cartridges are pricey, I prefer the convenience of not having to replace cartridges as frequently, so the largest volume cartridge cost is worth not having to replace it as often. I am considering a refill kit to reduce costs further. Online purchases costs slightly less than Staples or Office Depot when shipping is factored in."
5,Absolutely wonderful!,"My all-time favorite Christmas CD. The kids in the Toronto Children's Chorus beautifully handle complex music and harmonies, ancient and modern songs, and lyrics in English, Latin, and French. Harp solos layer on more atmosphere. The overall result is rich and gorgeous. The final cut, Twelve Days of Christmas, is a little gimmicky, but what the heck, the kids probably had a blast with it. The rest of the disc is so beautiful it could make you cry."
4,An excellent Children's Chorus,"I am a fan of Healey Willan's music; therefore, I picked this cd up for the Willan's version of The Huron Carol. The arrangement is excellent - I was not disappointed.The album as a whole is excellent. The children's choir is well trained. Good enunciation, voices blending well etc. All in all an excellent Christmas album. Unfortunately, there are no cuts that stand out as a superb. There are so many excellent Christmas albums of which this is one - pick it up as among the best of the children's choir Christmas albums, or because you are particularly fond of the harp, or because of some particular piece as I did for the Willan. You'll not be disappointed."
1,Picture book that is NOT in color,"Know that this book is a picture book that is NOT IN COLOR. I returned it for that reason. I needed color photos for my hobby and was shocked to find this book without color. It's a great book with alot of information and alot of pictures....JUST NOT IN COLOR which makes the photo details hard to discern. It rendered the book worthless to me, unfortunately."
5,Simply Enchanting,"Even an original hardback copy of Peter Pan would be hard pressed to live up to this incredibly illustrated edition. When I picture various scenes from Peter Pan, I have an idea of what everything looks like. Amazingly, illustrator Scott Gustafson captures these scenes beautifully, and through a magic of his own he brings them to life.I am so entranced with this edition that I am buying copies for every child of my family and friends. Imagination is quickly becoming a lost art for all but the youngest of children. An incredible book such as Peter Pan illustrated in such an artful way by an artist such as Scott Gustafson helps us all to find the magic of imagination once again.Do not miss out on this book, and look for many of Scott Gustafson's other illustrated books while you can!"
5,A lovely version.,"Peter Pan is among my favorite children's tales. This a particularly lovely version because it's unabridged and has beautiful illustrations. In this version, the story and characters take on a rich quality that is missing in the Disney and other shorter version. Nonetheless, I think the the original version of the story is better appreciated by teens and adults. For young children, some of the shortened versions work better. As your own Peter Pans start to grow up, hand them a copy of this book. Maybe they'll learn to fly in their imaginations for at least a little while longer!"
5,A Classic Continues to Charm...,Bought this to read to my sons and they enjoyed it as much as I did when I was a child. The pictures are outstanding and helps little imaginations soar into dreamland. Adventures abound in the book and in my children. J.M. Barrie created a treasure to last through all time.
4,Terrific illustrations/ Classic story!,"The artist has created stunning paintings that accentuate this beloved classic tale. The models chosen to portray each character were great choices and I love his use of lighting throughout. I was surprised, though, by the amount of violence throughout the story. It's subtle enough to avoid lasting impressions, but it should be noted. Interesting how Barrie pits every female on the island against Wendy. The girls just can't seem to get along. Peter is definitely the much sought-after Alpha male figure."
4,Success of digital photo in storytelling.,"I've read the story/play before getting this book, and I must say the digital images really elaborates a new wave of magic. The digital imaging photographs are great in company with the writing. The colors are fantastic and the typography really promotes the tension of the plotline. For any illustration or fine art student this is one book you must have for reference. It is like taking Disney's Peter Pan into live action, except with lesser background scenes."
2,Disney actually improved on this one,"How many of these other reader reviews are by children or their parents? I read this book to my eight year old boy (and by the way we don't even do Disney), and have to say I was apalled. Call me a fuddy-duddy, but Tinkerbell's behavior as a little tart and the ... suggestiveness of Wendy and Peter were just too much for a young child. Their role-playing as ""father"" and ""mother"" was far too mature for my kid. This is a good book for Freudians and students in lit classes."
3,Interesting,"This book is not about childhood. Rather, it is about how adults (or, at least, one adult) views childhood. Anyone with children would have to laugh all the way through. The cliches are both hysterical and pathetic at the same time. It really is a book with no discernable plot; rather, it is just a collection of vignettes. I honestly believe if Disney had not made a movie of it, it would still be a rather obscure book in the USA (of course, the same can be said for the Pooh books and Mary Poppins). I am not saying it is not an enjoyable story. It is. But it should only be looked at as a cute, if some what violent, children's book. It has no message and no greater meaning as some seem people to think."
1,"violent, mean and turgid","After I read the original ""Wizard of Oz"" to my five-year-old son, I thought ""Peter Pan"" would be another good one. I was wrong. This is not a story for children -- and it's not even a well-written story for adults. I never thought I'd say this about any book -- stick with the movie!"
5,amazing:D,"i loved this book, great choice:) its awesome, and i plan to buy more peter pan products... gotta love the classics!"
4,Peter Pan,"Arrived in good time and in fairly good secondhand condition. With the word Original in the heading thought it may have been less commercial as had photos from the film, but okay."
5,Post Review: Peter Pan,"The book ""Peter Pan"" is an exceptional book for children. It opens up the world of fantasy and imagination for a child. With it's bright and colorful illustrations, the book is for sure to entertain and give a child the sense of adventure."
5,Short and sweet story of railroad dome cars,"A nice video of dome cars in the Continental US and Canada.It has great clips of classic Vista Domes and videos and stories of new dome cars. There are interviews with dome car owners, operators and riders including Arthur ""Amtrak"" Lloyd. It includes very nice photos of original dome cars and marketing advertisements, including the first dome car, the CB&Q; Silver Dome. It has a section of classic dome cars still in operation. Video clips of both the inside and the outside of dome cars. There's also a history of the modern dome car design in Alaska Railroad (Alaska RR and Pacific Princess) and Canada as well as concepts of future dome cars.A must-have for railroad dome car fans."
1,Did not work at all,"Didn't work at all with our portable DVD player. The connector fits and it has a setting for the right voltage, but the unit acts like there is no power supplied at all. The DVD player works fine so I believe this Universal DC Adaptor was just defective."
5,The 10 Kindest Answers,I found this DVD to be of great help at a time when help was needed. It answered questions that covered the full range of 'must know' topics. I agreed with the solutions that were posed and it validated what my 'gut' was telling me. It has given me a great sense of 'not being alone' and that is of tremendous relief to me. I recommend watching it with all family members and keeping a copy on hand for anyone who wonders if they may have a family member in distress.
5,One of the great live albums,"Much like ""Songs in the Attic"", by Billy Joel, or ""Frampton Comes Alive"", ""Paris"" represents the essential work of the artist, both in terms of performance and material. The recording was stellar, the performances perfectly honed, and the audience wildly receptive and responsive. The songs only gain from their live performance, easily outstripping their studio versions, both in pace and production. If you only own one Supertramp album (like me), this is the one to have."
5,Excellent Self-help For Individuals & Couples,Stosny's book is excellent! It teaches individuals how to heal from the pain anger has caused and how to heal relationhips damaged by anger in clear and simple steps. I have used the book in counseling with couples struggling in emotionally and physically abuse relationships. Doing the exercises and applying the principles in this book can bring peace and power to the individual and to the relationship.
4,good book,this book is good because it focuses on the soulution to the problem without really making anyone feel bad in the process. It is a very non-threatening approach for the abuser and very helpful for the person being abused. Very positive book. Some of the exercises seemed repetitive and some concepts sounded really complex and just need to be simplified. I learned alot from this book and would recommend it to a friend.
2,Not what I was hoping for,"I am researching a book for partners of people with personality disorders and was hooked by the title and premise. But here's the big problem: your abusive ex must want to read the book, go through boot camp, and change his ways. And yes, it's ""his"" ways, since another premise of the book is that emotional abuse by women isn't as bad as emotional abuse of men, because women have more fear. That may be so, but abused men have more shame. So on the bad side for me, this book doesn't much deal with women abusers, and the abuser has to WANT to change. On the good side, it looks like there will still be plenty of room in the world for the book I am going to write."
1,Biased and stereotypical,"I agree with the reviewer below. This entire book is geared towards the male abuser and says very little to nothing about the female abuser. It is very unfortunate because there are men out there trapped in abusive relationships, but you would never know it from reading this book!"
1,Not worth even 1 star.,Doesn't work like a DVD+RW. You can't erase a DVD. Occassionally you may find one which can be erased. Pay more and go for some branded one.
1,DO NOT TRY TO PLAY THIS ON YOUR MAC COMPUTER,"...it will freeze the system and require a hard reboot -- you may lose data.I have written to EMI twice about this and they do not reply.I saw a version of this production in the movie theatre and it was a knockout, so I wanted to get the DVD. But I watch DVDs on my 27"" iMac, and this will not play.:-("
2,The dark side of hamlet,"The reviews of this DVD were so wonderful, that I purchased it, with great anticipation. I was disappointed. The sets are non existent,the lighting is poor and dark. The singing by Keenlyside is great but Dessay, who is very dramatic in this role, does not measure up! Those who heard Marlis Petersen in the HD Met performance would not like any other in this role."
5,Dessay - Ophelia of our time!,This is really a remarkable recording and mostly owing to breathtaking Ophelia sung by french soprano Natalia Dessay. I had a change to see and hear her live in a operatic recital and she is truly the best coloratura and classical bel canto soprano of our time. She also proves this in the role of Ophelia. The most celebrated mad scene is a real treasure and it really displalys the mastership of Natalia. Her unique sharp and tender voice at the same time combined with the ability to perform all the nuances of mad mind make this scene the highlight of the recording. Bravo Natalia
5,Quick Bag For Short Trip!,"Love this bag!!! I love that it can be wiped down!!! Also, my child is 15 months. Her Dad prefers this bag over our large Kalencom (out of New Orleans).It is large enough to hold Large Section- wipe case, 2 diapers, diaper changing pad (the one that came with our Kalencom bag, sippy cup, 1 or 2 small toys. Zipper area- holds keys, pacifier. Large side pocket- travel size Kleenex, spoon (for eating out) and still a little space left over. We use this for a short trips... out to eat, little boy's football game, run to grocery store, etc. Only wish the strap was a few inches longer that way you could put it on your shoulder."
1,TENY TINY ITTY BITTY,"This thing is for a small child, it said it was a small diaper bag. This will not even hold one diaper, wipes and a bottle, you cant close it, and the button dont work anyway...This is however only the second item I have ever had a complaint about."
5,Another fabulous book by the great Mary Castillo!,"I was SO excited for this book to finally come out, especially after enjoying Hot Tamara so much. Mary has such a magic touch when it comes to comedy and drama. Isa is so dang lovable, you have to check out this book! Congrats Mary, on a job well done. now - when is the next one coming?"
4,"great,but not best dvd ever","This dvd is going to be great! It has my favorite episode of mystery incroporated on it, it is the wrath of krampus. It's an In your face episode. Though I might wait a little longer to get this one. Want something older? Try scooby doo 13 spooky tales holiday chills and thrills."
3,Scooby-Doo Mystery Incorporated: Season 2 Part 1: Danger in the Deep,What happened to the last 2 episodes? #14 The Heart of Evil and #15 Theater of the Doomed? Those 2 episodes complete the season. They are missing from the DVD. I am disappointed they were not included.
5,Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated: Season 2 Part 1: Danger in the Deep.,This item is good for collectors of any Scooby Doo Products.I recommend Scooby Doo DVD to fans of any age.
3,not the best but is of this series,This series is not great. This is the best dvd of the series though. I would reccomend Scooby doo where are you and scooby doo show
5,Very entertaining and comprehensive.,"Steve Kent has done a fine job of amassing countless interviews, facts, and anecdotes to provide a very entertaining and insightful look at the history of video games. I especially enjoyed reading about the early years up to the crash and subsequent decline of the arcade industry through the 80's. Don't just take Steve's word for it though, the book is filled with direct quotes from practically every major player in the video game industry. From Nintendo to Sega, from Atari to Midway, frome Intellivision to Colecovision, from Commodore to 3DO, it's all in here. I really can't think of one aspect of the video game industry that was left out. Very impressive job."
5,Great book,"I have been a video game fan/player since the Atari 2600 days, and have always wanted someone to write a book like this. Kent does a great job interviewing all the key players from every significant video game company, including Nintendo, Atari, Sega, and Sony. At 560 pages, the book encompasses every significant ""VG"" development, including the key technology developments, decisions, and lawsuits that shaped the market the way it is today. The book is current through 2001 so it is right up to date. Highly, highly recommended!!"
4,Great book,"This is a great book, not visually impressive, but excelent contentwise. And huge too, really heavyJust not going to give 5, because the fragile paperback cover got some white in the borders."
4,ultimate history review,"great reading I would have given this 5 stars but there were hardly any pics of any of the retro game machines ,and I think more could have been written about atari I mean it was the company that started it all.It kind of seemed geared more to nintendo in my opinion with chapter after chapter devoted to them .but all in all a good read ."
5,Not Game Over.,"This comprehensive book covers the entire history of video games, from the first pinball machines right up to before the launch of the Gamecube and Xbox. Telling the story from the viewpoints of the people who actually made the games happen, this book gives gamers and non-gamers alike a better appreciation of video games and the changes that they have brought to the world, even when they weren't for the better. Strongly recommended. I hope there will be an expansion pack someday."
5,Must have for every gamer,"The book is really good, although I think at the beginning it focuses only in the Atari point of view, a lil incomplete but hey, you could write an entire encyclopedia about gaming and it would still be short.But still if you are a gamer or a businessman, this is a must have, must read and must memorize."
3,Déu,"Très peu de visuels (quasiment pas en fait), et le propos est centré à 80% sur Atari (qui ne représente pas 80% du jeux vidéo !). Le livre est pas mal mais très loin d'tre la référence ""ultimate"" auquelle je m'attendais. Déu."
3,Not a coffee table book,"I love coffee table books, and I bought this thinking it was. I was hoping for a lot of historical pictures, and was disappointed with the few black and whites in the middle. I skimmed through the text and found a few interesting subjects, but nothing really engaged me. If you're looking for well-researched and detailed industry happenings, this book is great. If you're looking for a coffee table book, this isn't it."
1,Sorry....just a bit too dry,Very Sad I wasted the money on this book.It has some good factual material and seems to be complete...but comparing against other video game history books...this one is dry.Very few black and white pictures...This book will put you to sleep...sorry just not happy with this one.
4,"A very good book, but could be better","I'm still reading it, but I saw some errors and some missing parts in early history of video games. I also didn't like a little bit the lack of pictures, illustrating the book sections. There's just a few pages of illustrations in the middle of the book. It's sure a great book, but could be better."
4,EXCELLENT READ,"Since I have bought this book I havent been able to put it down. The book is filled with in depth information about all the major video game companies. From ""Tennis For Two"" to the Xbox, its all here in this well written book, including stories about the mafia, drugs, in-fighting,mistakes made, court cases,rise and fall of companies, and lots more interesting stuff that I would have never of known about if I hadnt had bought this book. The book is full of quotes from people in the video game/software business, that help show two sides of the stories. I have read many books on video games, but most just skim the surface. This is by far the best. The only reason that I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is the lack of pictures and illustrations, there are only a few pages of black and white photos in the centre of the book, most of wich are of programers or company managers.So if you are into Video Games, give this book a go."
4,"Lots of good stories, little to pull it together","An exhaustive account of the business of games, with plenty of inside information. Not much theory or analysis about why any of it happened, but that's not important for the probable audience of this book.If you want to know about how the various genres developed, this is not the book. If you want to review the history of companies and remember some good old games, this one is great."
3,"History of Hardware, Not The Games","The Ultimate History of Video Games is ultimately a misleading title. While the book does do a good job at detailing the rise of the industry (mostly through Atari) it spends more time talking about the hardware of consoles, lawsuits, and internal arguments than the thing that actually makes video games so interesting: the games themselves. Worth reading for the first half, but left a lot to be desired."
5,Excellent social look at video games,"In many ways, this book may be misrepresented to people. Its not simply ""hey, remember how awesome this game was?"" type of book, nor does it look at games from a technical side (though technology is featured at times). This is more to do with the social impact of games. As such, it does not spend excessive time on the failed consoles, or failed games (though the exception can be made for the Atari-buster known as E.T.).Its a very useful book, I'm using it for a college class! Its probably the first 'text book' i'll actually look forward to keeping! The book is about as comprehinsive as one volume can be (and obviously, books like High Score and Game Over will complement this book). It is comprehensive, and exhaustive, as there are many excerpts from the people that made the games, and changed the world of home entertainment. A great book, when teamed up with a personal history of video games, this can shed some light on the people and events behind the games."
5,Excellent instructive Sicilian manual,"This book by Levy and O'Connell is a wonderful primer on the Sicilian defence, that is instructive as well as entertaining. The authors mention Fine's Ideas Behind the Chess Openings in the intro., and it is apparent that they tried to write the book they thought Fine would write, if he were to focus just on the Sicilian. There is a great deal about pawn structures. The book is similar to the ""Mastering the ..."" opening series, such as the Bellin and Ponzetto books. An excellent, high quality work. I would recommend getting the hardback copy."
1,Not as advertised!,Please note! This book is NOT 3 volumes in one as advertised. It is only the 3rd volume of the set.
5,Soul-stirring Music,"I first heard Ridgely at Young Life camp where I was able to personally meet them. This cd combines unbelieveable guitar playing with moving lyrics and excellent harmonies. All tracks are very ""hummable"" and stirring. After meeting these musicians, I am sure of their dedication to God and the sincerity of their music! No Christian music collection is complete without this cd!"
5,Jet drill press,"Product came quickly,and surprisingly in very good condition for being so heavy. Easy set up. Overall just what I expected and more."
3,Not too bad,"I was looking for a replacement for my ""quickie pie maker"" and bought the Diablo. It makes great sandwichs and I would easily give it a five if the clip on the handle didn't keep coming off when I tried to close it. If they could strengthen that, I would buy another one because of my satisfaction with the sandwiches."
4,Love it!,I was a bit worried when I purchased this as some reviews stated that it falls apart sometimes. In my case that has not happened once. I have used this at least 50 times and it's still going strong! Makes pies and sandwiches perfect each and every time. My daughter loves the crisp little sandwiches this thing makes and we love to experiment with different fillings. I could not be happier with this purchase.
3,A bit of nostalgia and YUMMMY,"In the '50's we had an aluminum pie maker which we loved. The DIABLO pie maker is a good modern-day version of this.Definitely NOT for an open campfire or even a fireplace it is best on a stovetop. The shorter handles are better suited to this kind of use.The wire closer latch seems pretty flimsy and the quite short handles can get dangerously hot if you don 't keep your hands back from the metal part. All in all its an adequate tool at the price. I would keep the following in mind if you buy:1. NOT for camping or fireplaces, no way.2. Handles can get hot.....use hotpads or gloves.3. Your imagination will create all kinds of yummy goodies with the Diablo. Its' little horns are cute."
4,memories,I BOUGHT THIS FOR A FRIEND OF MINE. HIS GRANDMOTHER MADE HIM GRILLED CHEESE IN A SIMILARSANDWICH MAKER. IT BROUGHT BACK MANY GOOD MEMORIES FOR HIMSUSAN
1,Poorly designed & constructed product,This product is a knockoff of one that was produced in the 1950's and the design makes it very difficult to place the pieces of bread in the correct position. It is constructed with two poorly designed cotter pins that fall out and get lost easily making the product useless.I returned the product for a refund.
2,Sanwhich maker,This product doesn't work like I thought it would. Honestly I think I wasted my money on it and will never purchase anyting like it again.
5,FOUND THIS PRODUCT AFTER 40 YEARS OF LOOKING,MY MOTHER HAD A SIMILAR PRODUCT WHEN I WAS YOUNG AND LIVING IN NEW YORK AND HAVE BEEN LOOKING IT FOR ABOUT 40 YEARS
2,"Great Block, Ultra-Cheap Knives","I had been watching this product for about two months, when one day it dropped down to somewhere in the $12.00 range, so I decided to pick it up.The knives themselves come sharp, but they do loose their edge rather quickly.My biggest complaint about these knives are they are so cheap they rust if they remain wet for even a short time. I have had two knives which rusted after just one hour of sitting in a bowl in my sink!!For the price I paid, I feel I got an amazingly well-built knife block. If you can get this for the same price I did, buy it! Then when it shows up, throw away the knives and put your other knives in the uber-cool block!!This knife block is one of the most talked about items in my kitchen -- folks love the double-glass block design!"
2,Knife block is okay,"You certainly don't want to purchase this set for the knives, which are very low quality. The kife block is just okay but is unique enough to make it worth while."
1,Beat the bootleggers?,"Rather than beating the bootleggers, this sounded exactly like a bootleg album, badly recorded on a mini tape machine by someone at the side of the stage. The quality was awful."
4,"The answer to the ""31 Episode"" question...","The 31 episodes here are the ones that were not copyrighted properly....and have become ""public domain"" titles. That's why you'll find tons of companies putting them out. (Some episodes have a producers logo in the lower left corner of the screen, to help prevent copying.) You'll also notice that the copyrighted Bonanza theme music is gone (substituted with generic western music), so the DVD company doesn't have to pay the music publisher for its use. That's also why these things are relatively cheap to buy. The quality of the picture and sound on these episodes is pretty good, however."
4,Great Value - Great Quality,"While I agree that the case itself requires a bit of care when removing the DVDs, the value of this set more than makes up for this small issue.Yes, 20 full-length episodes of Bonanza on 5 DVDs (4 episodes per double-sided DVD), for less than $20! I've watched 8 episodes so far, and the quality of these episodes are as good as the ones shown on TV Land. I've yet to notice any glitches or color issues. Plus, these episodes are early ones with Adam (Pernell Roberts), with the original title sequences and all!I recommend this set to any Bonanza fan."
3,Nothing new,"This might be a ""new"" release, but it's the same old episodes that slipped thru the copyright system, just repackaged. A perfectly decent collection if you don't have any Bonanza episodes on DVD, but if you do, check carefully as these will probably be duplicates."
4,Doesn't crash. At all. It's not the software,"I've been playing this game for years. Loaded on various machines for me and quite a few times for other people. Not to mention knowing many in the Links community. This software does not crash on properly maintained machines. Period.Good game. Excellent add on environment. Course builder. Swing mechanics and physics. All in all, a solid golf game."
5,Great Golf Computer Game,When I play the comptuer game I feel like I am playing real golf. I'd rather play real golf but when I cannot do that this game is a good substitute. If you look on the internet there are many many courses for you to download after you buy the game. The free download courses are bettter than the ones you get with tha game. Enjoy this 5 stars.
5,Links 2003,I have played Links for many years. This latest edition Is very good. They get better with each edition.
1,Worst graphics problems I ever had,"I have a Windows 2000 PC with an NVIDIA GeForce2 card. All other games work perfectly. This game will not render a screen without massive geometric objects obscuring most of the course every time it paints a view. I have tried loading the latest drivers from NVidia (per the Microsoft support site recommendation) and also loaded a patch to Links 2003(again, recommended by the M-Soft support site). There was no change to the useless rendering. I will never purchase another Microsoft PC game. My recommendation, stick with companies that know how to build games and avoid Microsoft"
2,A dramatic portrayal of reason in search of truth,"The book is written in play form and I decided after the second reading that I would actually pay money to see this on (or off) Broadway, preferably with Patrick Stewart playing Socrates and Liev Schrieber playing Christ.The book utilizes the socratic method (asking lots of questions) to arrive at the truth which, for Kreeft and many of his readers, leads directly to Christianity. I found his book ""A Refutation of Moral Relativism"" to be more compelling, but this is a good introduction to the socratic method as well as an amusing take on academia."
1,A Better title would have been Socrates and the strawman,"What a terrible terrible book. The idea is great, the writing style is very good. The author totally blows it. Rather than take on the real challenges that face Christianity the author chooses to play the strawman game.When defending Christianity rather than deal with substantive objections, the author chooses to place in the mouth of critics the most inane, uninformed arguments possible. This means that either as an author he did not have the chops to deal with truly difficult questions or he specifically choose strawman arguments. In either case there are much better books to read. If you want to read a good book on Christianity choose something by Yancy.There are too many good books in the world and too little time. Doesn't waste your time on this one. """
1,The real Socrates would not be happy,"& if you're a true fan of him neither will you. I thought this would be an interesting read because I love Socrates and find religious debate fun. But this book is pathetic, it completely removes Plato's Socrates for someone with an incredible misunderstanding of the Socratic Method."
1,Logic divorced of ethics,"I've read the book entirely. And it is written at very simplistic level. I found the book anything but logical, with many common falacies (""straw man"", ""ad homenem"" , ""appeal to authority"" etc..). But even if we assume that the book is logical, that is beliving in a dictatorial deity is a neccessary path to salvation, I doubt Socrates will find this ""slave logic"" as ethical."
3,not a book review - a note to the guy from Mars Hill....,"Hey, Captain MArsHill - before you go about offering advice on what ""punning jabs"" aimed at Harvard and Andover schoool of ?(some school i've never heard of???) Kreeft should and should not include in his next edition - get your facts straight. Kreeft does not teach at BU - better do more research on this one cheif. Practice before you preach. Read before you write. Note to all readers - the only reason this guy posted a review is to have a sounding board for his dislike towards BU, which is fine. But this is not the place for his opionion for two reasons: a)PEter kreeft does not teach at BU and, b) this is not a place for personal opinions about stuff pertaining to issues outside the sphere of the book at hand."
1,NEVER RECEIVED THE ITEM - CAN NOT RATE,IT IS OVER A MONTH SINCE I ORDERED THE--LOGIC3 ISTATION3 IDPOD SPEAKER SYSTEM -- IT IS A GIFT FOR MY HUSBAND --- I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT I HAVE NOT RECEIVED THIS ITEM -- AND I HAVE NOT GOTTEN AN UP-DATE ON IT AT ALL --- CAN YOU PLEASE HELP IN THIS SITUATION???? --- KAREN SPELMAN....KJKB831@AOL.COM....THANK YOU
5,Best Price? FYI,"FYI-The Jet 1642 is periodically discounted on the CPO Jet website but not necessarily on Amazon. The most recent 15% discount was mid August of 2012 for four days, a Fri-Mon. I reported this to Amazon and received no response. I contacted Jet, selling on Amazon, and they simply told me the sale was over-essentially ignoring the substance of my comment, two prices from the same vendor for the exact same item. Buyer beware!I've used this lathe and it matches a large segment of woodturner's interests. Variable speed is the way to go when getting into larger pieces as is the 2 hp motor. Nice smooth operation allowing you to match the speed when starting an unbalanced blank.Update-FYI-11/25/12-the sale at CPO Outlets is going on over Black Friday-15% off w/ free shipping ($2209.99) that's for the 2 hp model."
5,very pleased.,I have had this lathe for about 2 years now and it works great. I have turned several hundred bowls with no problems at all. It has plenty of power to turn any size bowl that would like.The variable speed works great. I would definately recommend this lathe.
5,A Do No Miss Item,"I came across the Faith Lesson Series DVDs at a Christian Library. I watched one tape, then another, and decided to have a Bible Study Lesson centered on them. We started with 3 people, and grew to 9-10 regular attendees. Ray Vander Laan is a gifted, knowledgable teacher. We learned so much as he literally opened up the bible. At the end of the Bible Study Sessions, the attendees had a greater boldness to go out and witness for Jesus Christ."
1,Oops,I obviously didn't read what the book was about. I thought this book was connected with the british crime film Hard Men. Imagine my surprise when the book arrived.
5,Pawprints Special Chocolate Labrador Retriever Calendar!,"Okay, I have to admit right here that I do not personally have a Chocolate Labrador Retriever padding around my ten acres of sylvan splendor YET. But, on the other hand, I do hope to somehow garner one for the pack sometime soon. Meanwhile, I can plan ahead and grab myself a great 2005 calendar that is devoted exclusively to Chocolate Labs! It is a nice change of pace, and for people like me who love Labradors, you can never have too many of a good thing, although when I had six dogs late in the 1990s I was perhaps approaching the borderline of the limits to the tolerable. At least my lady friend at the time thought so; hehehehe.. At any rate, it is indeed a lovely calendar, one filled with great shots of beautiful dogs, and one that is perfect for an inexpensive gift for that student or friend who could use a little touch of whimsy and wonder in their daily life. Enjoy!"
2,Very detailed and good looking. But...,"As far as it goes for being a collectible or action figure, it's great as long as its put on a shelf. I would really hate to break her arm off considering I paid 70 bucks.That's why it's a 2 star. Amazon had it as the last one and I told my wife to look around and hopefully find a cheaper one. Well she couldn't find one so ordered. And the next day, amazon had it posted from a different seller for 10 dollars cheaper. Its still bad enough at 60 dollars.Unless you're die hard, find one on eBay."
3,Good combination of ingredients especially for asthmatics but bitter taste.,"This is a good combination of herbal ingredients like licorce, mullein, and marshmallow. But it has a bitter taste I find difficult. I prefer the simpler Root It Away syrup by Terra Firma Botanicals. It was more effective at bringing up phlegm and contains more beneficial ingredients for asthmatics with stubborn chest cold coughs like osha, elecampane, honey and fennel. Plus it's organic or responsibly harvested. I can't say the same for Dr. Christopher's though it is readily available here on Amazon and slightly cheaper. I cannot get past the taste."
5,Learning from others...,"Some people you can tell them the stove is hot. Some have to see someone else get burned. Still, others have to get burned. This is a good book for people to learn how to avoid a Darwin Award."
4,Darwin Awards......best of bizarre and stupid behavior,"The Darwin Awards stories are ALWAYS interesting and ALMOST ALWAYS amusing. I look forward to getting one for Christmas or my birthday every year! They are a celebration of the old adage that genius has it's limits, but stupidity knows no bounds.The book is well worth the read and a great one, because of it's short story format, to keep in the bathroom or take to work for your lunchbreak. The latter is a better use because you will want to share the tales with friends and co-workers.Even stupid people should own a copy if only as an example for what NOT to do!!!"
2,Amusing trifle,"Amusing in parts, if you've read the others in the series this is pretty much more of the same, only it has the taste of cold leftovers. Lots of padding in the form of quotes and ""background"" info stretch it out a bit."
1,Overall opinion,"I have not yet read Darwin 3, so my comments are general to all of Wendy's books.Having been a regular contributor to the Darwin forum since I first became internet aware, I find that some of the stories are only alternative versions of previous items that have been aired in Wendy's forum for our criticism.Although I love tales of human stupidity, when I repeatedly come across the same story in a different format, I lose interest. This is why I have not purchased the third book.Maybe she should read Stephen Pyle's 'Book of Heroic Failures' and reconsider her overall content and layout."
2,Tiresome imitation of first two classics,"I found this version to be far behind the previous two books. The authors filled these pages with ""undocumented"" personal accounts and stories that barely resemble the entries found in the first two books. This book qualifies only as a tiresome collection of made up stories, few of which actually qualify for a true Darwin Award. Do yourself a favor.... re-read both of the first two classics and leave this fairy tale collection at the bookstore."
4,lover of darwin awards discussion of the Magoo principal,"I design electronic devices that are implanted in the human body. Items such as pacemakers, cochlear implants, insulin pumps, neural stimulators etc. I discovered the Magoo principal. Many a time a device is designed with two accidental flaws in it. each flaw potentially deadly, but the two together cancel each other out. I don't know how this fits into your review. Sort of two stupid or erronious things cancel each other out. Sometimes one is fixed revealing the other. Have you discovered anything like this in your studies. I believe this occurs more than one would expect.Sincerely,Joe SchulmanJoe@schulman.orgSincerely,Joe Schulman"
3,Scraping barnacles,"Some have criticised this volume for a lack of examples of really outstanding stupidity but on at least 3 occasions we read of people ""careening"" down a road. 'Careening' is the act of scraping barnacles from the bottom of a ship and if this has been attempted in the circumstances described, on so many occasions, then this is truly a wonderful way to earn a Darwin!!!Please, please, Darwin use language correctly."
3,Where have all the laughter gone?,"I thought that the darwin awards 1 was absolutely hilarious. But number 3 was running low on material. All the stuff in the book was stupid things people have done, but they weren't nessecarily funny. I think that you need to choose the funniest incedents for your next book, not nessecarily the dumbest."
4,Mine,"This book is extremely funny. It is bad the way these things happened, but the scenarios are really funny."
2,Running low on new (and humorous) material,"The latest book incarnation of the famed ""Darwin Awards"" by Wendy Northcutt covers the usual assortment of nitwits who offed themselves while doing things worthy of nitwits. An Internet phenomenon now on its third book, The Darwin Awards make for amusing reads for those who possess a little something dark in their humor.The problem with this third edition is that it simply does not deliver the goods when compared with previous editions. Has the joke worn off or are these examples not all that great? Is Northcutt running low on new material? Perhaps. Maybe a few more years between editions might make for better stories. The filler material in the book is also weak and further illustrates that there is not much here.Truth is, The Darwin Awards website is better than this book. And since the site costs nothing, skip the book."
2,Darwin Awards III: Survival of the Recycled Stories,"I was extremely pleased with the first edition of the Darwin Awards. However, the two subsequent editions were very disappointing. The stories were either recycled from the first edition or seemed to be taken from the Oddly Enough section in Yahoo News. Considering the intellegence of the author, one would think that each edition would be interesting and unique. This book is nothing more than an inexpensive cure for insomnia."
2,"Third time not exactly the charm, but ...","We are surrounded by idiots. If you aren't convinced, then pick up ""The Darwin Awards 3."" There's pleny there to convince you, and to keep you laughing as well. (Just be careful if you're prone to eat while reading; you just might be featured in ""Darwin 4."" Or ""Darwin 5."")But isn't the gag getting old? After three installments and endless write-ups in newspapers and magazines, we get the point. I'm not sure what's more disturbing: That the stories contained in ""Darwin III"" are (purportedly, at least) true, or that this series sells as well as it does.I mean, it's a great bathroom book -- something to read in short bursts (or longer bursts, depending on the state of your constitution), but I would hope there would be a greater hunger for more substantive reading.Still, if you're looking for the mental equivalent of a light snack, ""Darwin 3"" is perfect."
2,The books are getting worse,What was a good idea has been stretched too thin. The chapter introductions are unbearable. What should be light and frothy become instead attempts at a rather tiresome black humour. I realize that the author probably needs to publish everyonce in a while but this now is not funny and the overall feeling when one finishes is one of weariness for the poor souls who met their maker and the repeated attempts by the author to make light of them.
2,Blind Duster,"There is no free lunch. We have many sets of wooden blinds in our home. While this item tries to get the job done, it can not really get all the dust and house hold gunk off the blinds. I don't think anything will take the place of using a damp or dust spray filled rag and wiping each blade at a time. Bummer......but true.."
3,Kinda Works,"If you consider pushing the dust on the blinds into the strings of the blinds cleaning, then these will work for you. I have found that if you close the blinds and lightly spray with the appropriate cleaning solution for your blinds and wipe with a cotton cloth, you get much better results. It's quicker too. By the time you line up the slats of the blinds and get them in this thing you could be half way through cleaning one side of the blinds. I don't think this would be good for aluminum blinds because trying to line them up and get them into it may bend or kink them."
2,mini blind cleaner,"good idea but the fingers are placed to tight, making it hard to insert beetween blind. would not recomend this product."
1,Worthless,This product was exactly what I expected in terms of construction which was fine. The problem was that it took a lot of time and patience to make sure each blind was in the right slot and to do that several times for each shade. this tool was just not practical for the many mini blinds that need to be cleaned in our home.
1,bad quality,the item is bad and not cleane to useI CAN NOT CLEAN ANY THING WITH IT AND THE HEIAR IS DOWN
1,not worth it.,beautiful ring but the band bent and the stone fell out. also dryed my skin out and left a hard callus on finger.
5,Best Christian CD.,"What a great multidimensional CD. First of all, the music itself is original and compelling. Chaffer's voice is incredible. And as if this wasn't enough, it is lyrically one of the finest pieces of writing I have encountered in a long time. He does an impressive job of making some fine theological observations without being trite. And as my father once remarked while listening to this CD... ""This guys pretty good, but he's no Don Chaffer."""
4,Excellent,"1998 Anthony Nomination! This mystery is even better than the first one in this series. Ms. Schumacher has really out done herself on this one.El Paso Detective David Alvarez, who we met in ENGINEERED FOR MURDER, is working on a murder case in which a second floor room falls on 2 people, killing them. Detective Alvarez calls in Tory Travers, whom we also met in the 1st book, to help him figure out what caused the collapse. Before you know it, they are up to their necks in trouble, with a killer, who needs answers and is willing to do anything to get them. This is one killer who will stop at nothing to get his questions answered, even if it means killing Ms. Travers infant son and the son of Alvarez's partner, as he has threatened to do. The ending is Superb.I was so into this book, I couldn't put it down. I wanted to hurry and get all the answers myself! Thank you Ms. Schumacher for an excellent read."
3,When it's sleepy time .......up north,"Seems that not only the south is sleeping....that's an excellent bedtime CD.With a few lyrical touches (Graceful Touch, tracks 2 and 12) and an excellent bass (Harald Johnsen) some may like this CD.Reviewer J. Dennis is correct. There is no Bill Evans or Keith Jarrett in this music, only elegant, dreamy moods."
2,Jazz for the Lobotomized Set,"Well, I suppose this CD is cheaper than anesthesia, though perhaps harder to wake up from."
3,A Bit Too Slow For My Taste,"There's good jazz musicianship here if you like this slow style of jazz. Personally, I prefer the Marcin Wasilewski Trio or the Tomasz Stanko Quartet."
1,false hope,Was super excited for this item to arrive only to find all faceplates are for old model 360s... Useless.will return.
4,Good Introduction to AP Style,"I bought this book because I had a client that used the AP Style in their marketing communication and all outgoing documentation had to be reviewed using the AP Style. Being a technical writer, I had not used the AP Style before. Now I have a better understanding of why words are used the way they are in a newspaper. However, about 20% of the AP Style does not apply to technical writing."
3,Watch your Style,"If you need a guide for how to write to journalistic standards, this is definitely one place to go. The version I read, while very informative, was published before the widespread acceptance of the thing we now call the Internet, and as such, it's computer technology section may seem a bit dated.The only thing that bugged me was that they didn't use the spelling ""lede"" for the introductory statements of a news story, and as a former newspaper editor, this threw me for a loop when I saw it spelled ""lead."" Every time I saw it, my reading flow just slowed down, as if lead (that is plumbum) were handed to me, instead of a lede.Other than my hangups with using jargon where appropriate, this book should be used as a standard with respect to editing wording. However, if you're a writer of fiction, this book should be used more as a guideline, and not as a hard-and-fast styleguide. I mean, you wouldn't necessarily be abbreviating state names in your writing, now, would you?"
2,Not for finish work,"I am a plumber of 16 years.I needed a new tubing bender for a high end job that required i use ridged supply tubing on any fixture where the supply tube was visible by anyone standing in the room(toilet,wall hung sink,etc...).The 3/8 tubing was in a polished nickel finish.I thought i would try the General bender because i own a couple of General drain machines and have been happy with them.Priced reasonably, but by no means the cheapest, i ordered it.It came on time and in perfect condition.The bender has an aluminum body with long handles that i like.I decided to do some practice bends on some common 3/8 chrome supply tubing .The bends came out with creases and also twisted the tubing in a weird way.It bends the tubing to the degree you want, but it leaves the finish twisted and marred.This bender was never used for the job it was purchased for.My advice is to pay a few dollars more for the RIDGID bender."
1,"Lots of Preamble, Little in the Way of Insights","A great example that having Word 7 on a computer does not automatically qualify you to think you are a writer. This book, despite its promising title, devotes undue space and effort to introduction, upon introduction and does not bother to get into too much details. The title should read ""A High Level Overview of App. Servers"". If you know your basic Web stuff (like what Java, HTML, XML is) this book will leave dangling ... constantly asking ""where is the beef?"" Not a book for developers who want to know what they may be getting into."
4,cruella deville,"loved this costume. I wore it to work and in our Christmas parade. Everybody loved it. The dress is very thin and the wig was a little mismade, but it was fine."
2,a desire for more,"as a 30 minute read you'll get an overview of one of the most impressive leaders of the 20th century but you'll be left wanting to know more. the writing style feels heavily edited and the book leaves you with more questions than it answers. in fact for an overview you'd be better off watching gregory peck in the movie of macarthur. if you're a high school student and you need a quick read then this might be useful, but if you want to understand what drove mac arthur, why he did what he did, and get under the skin of this man - look elsewhere."
5,an excelent source of ancient Mexican designs,"I love this book! There are images in various shapes and sizes from very detailed to very simple. All designs have been reproduced in sharp black-and-white so they are easy see, copy, enlarge, etc. I reproduce the images in artwork and crafts and this book has proven to be EXACTLY what I need for my work. Also, each design is labeled with a brief description of it's use and where it was found. The designs are put in helpful categories by subject so if you are looking for a certain animal, that particular design is easy to find. Anyone even slightly interested in ancient Mexican designs will find this to be a beautiful book."
4,The Great Black Hope,"Jack Johnson was one of the most dynamic fighters who ever lived. It's sad that he is also one of the most forgotten.Geoffrey C. Ward has brought Johnson back to life in this compelling biography. I happen to be a boxing fan from way back but Ward has told me some things about Johnson that I didn't know. His prose is detailed and precise, with added information on the bottom of most pages. He show's Johnson as a flawed human being outside the ring but, a brillant fighter inside it.Ward also writes about the times that Johnson lived in where racism was the 'norm'. Johnson struggles not only with his opponents inside the ring, but the pure hatred outside of it. It is painful at times to read.This is a excellent biography on a truely complex human being.Enjoy"
5,Brilliant piece of work,I thoroughly enjoyed this book on Jack Johnson. The man was the best boxer of his generation and lived his life to the fullest extent outside the ring.The author has produced a tremendous work that completely looks at the life of the champion and gives a look at the USA in that time. Johnson had to deal with numerous issues in his day and he handled it in a manner that few could.Well worth reading.
4,A BIG SCORE!!!,"If you like your film music to be filled with lovely themes, rich harmonies and an all-round ""nice feel"" that makes you ""feel nice"" then do not touch this soundtrack! However, if you often feel in the mood for powerhouse action scoring in the vein of the Alien movie scores or similar violent film scores then grab this awesome soundtrack as soon as possible!Like so many others I was wary of this one due to the past compositional styles of Edward Shearmur. But what I found was one of the most brilliant action/millitant/agressive scores to come out in years. It never becomes repetative or boring and it is often filled with rich orchestration and wonderful electronic sound effects. Shearmur has now moved up to the big leage in my opinion and I look forward to hearing his work in the future!"
1,Great Time Liar!,"The reason I went and watched this show is that I was attracted by the poster.In the whole show, there is only one helicopter! I felt so fooled to be cheated by the poster!The score is bad as there is no sound of dragon barking at all!"
3,A Bit Dated Now,"It's been over 7 years since this has been updated, and a lot has happened in the world of postcards. I'd say that the vast majority of prices quoted in this book are much higher than prices realized at traditional and online auctions, and many retail sales. So, if you just found a shoebox of postcards in your grandmother's attic and are planning on selling them, don't expect to realize prices anywhere near most of the prices you see in this book. That said, there are exceptions - and condition really does play an important part in pricing, but as the Internet opens up dealers to a worldwide audence it appears that many cards that were in demand 10 years ago are no longer that scarce."
4,Nice book,Nice informative book Great pictures and a fine explanatory text. A valuable aid for a beginning collector. Worth the money.
5,Fast Service!,"I just bought a sospenders inflatable life vest and it contained the co2 cartridge but for some reason was missing the ""green tab"". This could be manufacture mess up. Or from the bait store i bought it. Couldnt find just a ""green tab"" so had to buy this complete rearming kit just to get the ""green tab"" i needed. Was not happy about that. But as far as this order and the rearming kit. . . . .it was super fast delivery and i was happy with my order!"
5,rearm kit,"I have used these two or three times, every time my inflatable vest gets wet. works good, easy to use."
5,Great Read!,"Very Good Read! Have read the whole series and passed it along to family to read, who have in turn passed it on to other family! Read these books!"
2,Misleading,"This is another impulse bargain item slewn together by EMI's budget branch. This includes covers of Kajagoogoo tracks from after he was given his cards (or walking papers), so to him, that would be a further slap in the face to have to do ""Turn Your Back on Me"" and ""Shouldn't Do That"" (really, but couldn't afford to pass up). I have those on another CD. There are other compliations you can get instead. It would make sense if this were one that says ""The Best of Kajagoogoo and Limahl"", which has been done. Plus more could be tracks of HIS not on CD. ""Too Shy"" is a given since it's forever his calling card."
4,great gift for kids!,"funny film. family film. keep children occupied film. Friday Family movie night film. if you have nothing to do, no friends, bored on a Sunday morning film."
1,can not download,"can only stream, can not download. No where does it say that you can only stream. You can not download it"
5,Love,"Love love love this movie! So funny, and I love the adult sense of humor in it when I watch it now. It was always one of my favorites as a kid."
4,Fun,"A good fun movie that anyone could watch a few times. SOme movies you see once and that is it, this one you can watch once in a while and still like it."
4,FAST painting but SLOW cleanup,"Works great but I wouldn't break it out unless I had a full room to do. Very easy to keep just the right saturation on the roller so painting goes super fast, but cleanup is a good 30-45 minute operation. Put the roller in a plastic bag between coats so it doesn't dry out.The technique I used to keep the roller at the right saturation was to ""Pulse"" the button. Press the button for a second every every 4 or 5 seconds, if it starts to get too wet you wait longer between pulses, if it starts to get too dry you shorten the time between pulses.I had a broken part on my power roller which didn't affect the function - Wagner sent me a replacement, no questions asked (Use email though, their phone support is lame)If you've found this review helpful, please let me know!"
1,cheap flimsy chinese made broken on first use,"Honestly I was excited to get this guy up and going. Simple enough to setup and begin painting! went through one color and began the cleaning process... Unit wont power up anymore? I wouldn't waste one cent on this product!! More and more now a days ""made in china"" is becoming a sign to steer clear of."
4,Makes a small dog feel Mighty!,"This ""Tigger Jr."" is now part of the slumber group. Portia (Yorkie), the eldest, has a hand-puppet tiger stuffed toy (""Tigger"") that has to be on the bed before sleep time, otherwise she'll start complaining. When Jake (youngest child-Maltese) came, I had to get a 2nd tiger since Jake isn't being gentlemanly and takes the 1st one from Portia. Since this toy is smaller and lighter, Portia has no problem letting it know who's the boss. Well, Jake still teases her and grabs 2nd Tigger away - boys!"
4,"Well, I liked it!","Cabled overalls, bulky vest, kimono, etc. Very cute and quick. No size 3 needles here! One of the top 3 for the 0-3 set I've seen yet! Quick and understandable for the beginner and a new perspective for experienced knitters to keep interested. A good one to keep around."
2,Nothing too inspiring,"I was disappointed with this purchase. The cover is so cute, but the only design that is really interesting is the pink and green hat with the pom poms. That just isn't enough to warrant buying the whole book."
4,Good quick knit book for babies,"There will never be a substitute for finer denier knits for babies, but if you find that to be too difficult, this is a good substitute. The patterns are cute, the designs are simple and easy to construct."
2,Again!?,"How many times can David Eddings write some little tale about a blue stone that is actually the force of good in the universe? Always, some mortal man picks it up and uses it to kill a God, only the BAAAAD force of the universe is actually in the God. No wonder he can pump out the books, he just scribbles out the names and locations, and fills them in! The characterization is good...if you only want one character that is. Every single one of them cracks the same jokes, has the same grin. Amusing for the first 20 pages or so, then its stereotypes and repetitive humour stars to come out. If you are searching for a good argument again human cloning, then read this book. A world of identical personalities loses its vivacity pretty quickly"
5,A fantastic conclusion to the Elenium!,"The last book of the Elenium is also the best of the series. Queen Ehlana has been revived and just the world remains to be saved by Sparhawk and his friends. So our hero has to travel again ... The funniest aspect of this book was to discover that the great hero Sparhawk has little to come up with against Queen Ehlana. The woman he raised from early childhood knows very well how to manage him and her kingdom. As always, the dialogues put an amused smile on your face. Therefore: I can't wait to start the Tamuli series and read more about Eosia"
2,I was very disappointed about Edding's final volume,"I enjoyed book I+II of the Elenium saga, but this volume is very boring. The heroes have changed and the only aim of Sparhawk's team is to slaughter and assassinate church soldiers. The book is so boring that you read the first twenty pages and then switch over to the last twenty page with the result that you don't miss a single thing. Sparhawk and his party travel around...fight battles...talk to strangers...fight battles....walk around. That is really boring and I am really disappointed. I don't think that I am going to read the Tamuli saga."
5,Greatest books ever,"I have read all of Eddings books, and many other.Now I do not know how to live without Sparhawk when I finished the last one. I can strongly recommend anyone to start at the first book, but be careful, you will not be able to stop until the last book is finished to the last page.I am from Sweden and I have read them all in swedish and now I will buy them in english to see if I missed anything in the translation."
2,The Sapphire Rose is the tying of too many loose ends.,"The Sapphire Rose does not resemble the first two books of the series. The main character's personalities and values have been changed. The relationship between the knight and the queen is ludicrous. The author seems to be tying up loose ends. There are so many loose ends, that all they do is talk, talk, talk. This book has been a letdown to an otherwise excellent series."
3,make-over fun,"Jessica and Elizabeth decide to help a girl named sandra who is very unhappy as she is tall and geeky and unpopular.Elizabeth is delighted when Jessica gives Sandra a make-over.Sandra is shocked and delighted also,as she is made to look her best.But soon Jessica regrets the makeover as Sandra is almost more popular than she is...and has this gone to Sandras head or is she still insecure??"
3,"Yeah, it's fine","I enjoyed the Sweet Valley Twins series in elementary school, and I used to read them all the time! This book, however, isn't one of the best. Jessica and Elizabeth meet Sandra Ferris, an unpopular girl at Sweet Valley Middle School. They give her a makeover, and magically overnight, she becomes the queen of popularity. I don't think it's very realistic that Sandra suddenly became so popular now that she was pretty. And Jessica was very selfish. Instead of feeling glad that Sandra had gained some new friends, Jessica was rude and jealous. However, I did enjoy reading it so I'll give it three stars."
4,Interesting and Informative,I bought this book for my Women in Medicine throughout History class and actually really liked the book. Lots of beautiful old depictions of women in the medicinal studies in history. It was relatively well organized. Some of the information contained in the book was contradicted by my other texts though... Easy read for the most part.
2,Hand broke on 2nd cut,"Purchased this cutter at OSH. My first cut on 3/4"" Schedule 40 PVC was great, but the handle broke near the blade while making my second cut. It was unsettling to have the tool snap and fall apart in my hand. On inspection of the cracked areas, the handles look like they are made of something resembling pot metal. Really cheap-looking. In the plastic packaging, this cutter appeared to be more heavy-duty and of higher quality than other cutters in it's price range. Surprise, surprise! OSH Customer Service refunded me in cash, without hesitation. This may have been an unfortunate fluke; possible a material defect, so I'm hesitant to say don't buy it. It might be a good idea to purchase where it can be easily returned for replacement or refund."
1,Mine is nearly new and the blade is already damaged,"I used it a few times and was really happy with how well it cut, but just now I wasn't able to cut a piece of 1"" PVC and was shocked to see that a big chunk of the blade is missing! Don't buy this thing unless you can secure some extra blades."
1,What to consider before you even buy the damn thing!,"Why would you waste [money] to buy a tool which obviously will need blade replacement and no way to buy them. No one knows who ""general"" is and althought the tool looks sound and that's about the price you can expect to pay for a good pvc pipe cutter, you have wasted [money] at the outset if you don't purchase a set of blades along with the tool itself! No guarantees that you will be able to replace the blades with some other companies product -- the editorial review does not even address this issue! And Amazon does not sell replacement blades."
1,Product is Good but ONTRAC delivery is really BAD,If you order this item make sure give instructions to Amazon to send this thru UPS or FedEX but BIG NO TO ONTRAC. I paid for 2 day shipping and I already instructed ONTRAC to leave the item in the leasing office but they never did and after 4 days they never call me that they did not leave the item from the leasing office until I called them for follow up. This is the 2nd time that Ontrac did this to my item.
5,Great Lathe,"I purchased this lathe because I already had the Jet 1014 and was happy with it except that I wanted a lathe with a larget swing and variable speed. I have now been using it for three months and have no complaints; it has met all of my expectations.Delivery was prompt and the carrier courteously wheeled the pallet containing the lathe right into my garage shop. I started to assemble it myself but my wife let me know how foolish she thought I was being and held parts for me while I tightened bolts. Really, two persons are a good idea. Since the head stock slides off, the weight was reduced just enough to give me false confidence.I have removed the wire mesh guard; most people work without one and I found it to interfere with my dust collection--that's a personal choice.I would recommend this lathe for consideration by anyone looking for a lathe in this catagory."
2,JET LEMON,"I have been having problems with my 1642 for the past 3 years. I have replaced all the bearing, spindle shaft and it still wont turn true. I have contacted the manufacturer and have gotten a run around every time I have called. When you are turning large bowls the 1-1/2 hp motor just cant handle it. If you are true craftmen and are doing accurate detail work I wouldn't sugesst buying the 1642. If you want quality customer service, do not buy the Jet 1642."
1,Brahms all over the place,"I have quite a few recordings of Brahms 4th and most of them are either taut or lyrical. This version is neither. It sounds more like a first rehearsal without any stops. There is no point of view, just the notes and nothing else. It is one of the worst recordings of classical standard repertoire I have ever heard. And the sound is muddy. Even though the price is extremely low, please avoid this recording."
2,The sizing ain't right.,"I wear US size 14 on Nike.I made the mistake of buying 2 pairs of size 14 Propet Country Walker recently - these shoes fit terribly. They ""bit"" into the back of my feet, and I had to get them stretched by the cobbler.While the quality is quite good, the sizing of the Country Walker is wrong. If you would like to purchase the Country Walker, please select one size larger. So, if you're a size 14 like me, buy a 15."
4,"Earthy sound, panoramic vision, DIY ethos rewarded","Surprisingly Eno-esque, for better (All the Tea in China--which could be off Taking Tiger Mountain) and worse (the endless imitation Overground Rail Catastrophe), this penultimate album by Graeme Jeffries, who's pretty much by this stage the band, captures well his home-studio ethos, his appealingly dusky vocals, and his command of that delicate yet meaty Kiwi alt-pop droning melody. He reminds me at times of another Graeme, Downs, of the Verlaines, in his delivery and stylistic restlessness. Although I differ from others and regard the (simultaneously recorded, more or less) follow-up to this album, Stompin' Through the Boneyard as a better place to begin for newcomers, this sprawling yet cohesive low-key yet dynamic album belies the fact that it's mostly one musician at work."
1,Wrong classification for this one,"If you are looking for a driving beat for your work out, keep looking. Some of the songs could pass for elevator music. A few had a driving beat, but it was not steady. I'd give it two or three stars in another classification."
3,for the price... not to bad,"filling the roller was kind of a pain if you don't do it right you'll be standing over the paint can for half an hour. however, once you get the hang of it it works great... didn't end up with paint all over myself... and nothing fell off or broke while i painted... hard to get into smaller spaces the roller and tube is just to long... but what do you expect. if you prime the roller correctly you have a very even coat... painted my daughters room in half the time it took us to do it before so all and all i'm pleased...clean up wasn't that bad... took me about 10-15 minutes and that's cleaning the roller itself too... took my husband about 30 minutes.... so maybe it's just a man thing."
2,NO ONE MENTIONED THE RUST!!!!!!,"The reason I gave this item two stars is because after two days of use, the pipe that feeds the roller RUSTED and our white paint turned rusty orange!!!!!It was such a waste of the paint and all the money spent on this roller when that happened.The roller worked fine the first two days. I was able to paint fast and cleanly as long as I did not pump too much paint into the roller head. The cleanup was easy as well.BUT, The RUST was the worst part of this pump. I wonder why they did not make the feeder pipe in ALUMINUM? That would be a great help."
4,haven't used it yet,This painting unit looks like it will speed up my painting at least twice as fast. I hope cleaning it out is easy like it is suggested.
5,A vote for the Paint Mate Roller,"This handy tool does take 20 minutes to clean, but it saves me countless hours of painting. Due to its size, it can't be used in tight quarters, but the length of the device extends the overall height to which I can paint, reducing my time on the ladder. My time is valuable. My safety is critical. I recommend using a tarp and reading the instructions carefully. I would pay twice the price for this tool to save the kind of time and effort I needed to complete the stairwell I just finished."
5,Wish I'd found this years ago!,"I don't understand the poor reviews...I LOVE this roller!! I paint in less than half the time as usual. I just finished painting the interior of an 1800 square foot house, and I'm sold on this product. Clean-up was easy,too. No tray to worry about...just follow the directions. At first clean up might take a little longer, but once you use it a couple times and don't have to refer to the directions, it's a snap."
1,DON'T BUY!!! Paint Mate = Paint All Over YOU,"I like the idea of a syringe style paint roller, but the quality on the seals are so low that when you plunge the pain, it ends up seeping out of all the joints. Consequently, I am not covered with drops of Kilz primer and will probably spend more time cleaning up the floor than had I just used a traditional roller. I don't know about their power products but based on this one, I'd have a pretty tough time being convinced their quality is any better."
2,Broke the second time I used it,The first application was brilliant and worked well. The second time I used it it seemed to lose the seal from the part that sucks up the paint so it was just dripping paint on me and everywhere. I tried tightening it down and seeing what the problem was but there was no way I could fix it so I threw it away after the second time I used it.
4,Simple fix for leak,"I had a problem with leaking paint from the paint input. I decided to use two layers of plastic (from a bag) to seal the input. Simply unscrew the piece, put the plastic over the input, and screw the piece back down. No more leaks! I love this thing - it saves me paint and I can clean it fairly quickly now."
4,It was ok....,"The one thing to keep in mind is that you are carrying a lot more paint at a time and will be a lot heavier in the beginning. I am not exactly the strongest so painting with this after initial paint loading was hard. My arms got tired quickly. After a while, the weight lessened and I guess after that it did beat having to bend down and reload a normal roller brush.I did find that after some use the roller part started to leak a little but just kept working with it. I would use it again...but first I'd work out a lot and get a little fitter.."
5,Paint Mate Plus,This is a great product. The cover over the roller cuts down the splatter to almost nothing. Using the filler tube is easy and I didn't spill a drop. It's very easy to regulate the amount of paint that comes out. It's a little tedious to clean up. I won't use it for rolling less than a gallon of paint.
2,Only 20 minutes long.,"No matter how good, spending a lot for a 20 minute video is way overpriced. I'll grant that they skip the usual warm up exercises in beginner's videos and get right to the techniques. They cover many techniques (maybe 20) but that shows how briefly each technique is covered. You see it once in slow motion, then at full speed and that's it. There's almost no explanation of what to be careful of when doing each technique, and no basic introduction to hip rotation or throwing. The video seems to assume you already know the basics."
3,Some surprises,"I actually bought this for one or two tracks, but overall it is a pretty good cd. Found myself enjoying it more that I thought I would with songs you don't hear everyday. Pleasantly surprised."
4,Great Medieval action story,"The Black Pope is the second book in the Falcon Strikes series.A great sword swinging story,along the lines of Conan.The continuing story of a Crusader returning to Europe with his mercenary band,and seeking vengeance upon the men who betrayed the Christian cause and murdered his father.A great series that unfortunately was never finished.Draco never completed his vengeance and the author,Mark Ramsay aka Jon Maddox Roberts,went on to other books,like Conan,The Cinglum,Murder in Tarsis and the SPQR series.C'mon Jon,don't be like David Gerrold,finish the series!"
5,OMG! OMG! OMG! A MUST READ!,"It's a very sweet book, literly. There's not that much fighting in it except for like just two parts in the whole book. Then there's also the romance. A must for reading, but read #1, #2, #3, & #4 first or else you wouldn't know what the heck is going on in the story."
2,Bring back Sugar Ray Norcia,"I have to admit, I've only got one other Roomful album, ""Under One Roof"", and I love it to death. So, expecting the same great soulful and energetic songs with bluesy, gruff vocals, I bought ""Thats Right"". Boy, was I disapointed. I barely made it through the first listen of the album. The whole thing came across as rushed and forced, as if the album was done because they had to, not because they wanted to. It had no life to it. But the thing I really couldn't stand was the current vocalist! Gone was the dynamics and attitude of Sugar Ray, replacing them was a very dull, flat, non-agressive singer (he's just waaaayy too smooth for a blues singer). Over all I was very dissapointed. I can't point out one track that really stood out for me, they all sounded the same; all nicely done, but with no heart or soul to any of them."
5,"Lots and Lots of Great ""West Coast"" Guitar In This One !","These Guys Let The Guitar Take A Center Stage On This One If You Like ""West Coast Swing Guitar"" And Lots Of It ,,This Is For You,,,Almost Every Song ""A Keeper"".. I Gotta Find More By This ""Chris Vachon"""
3,A jump on the retro swing bandwagon?,"This is a good session by jump blues band Roomful of Blues, this new vocalist is much better then that Norcia guy, much smoother, but there is a felling of ""Indigo Swing/Royal Crown Review/Big Bad Voodoo Daddy"" here, in other words this was basicaly a jump on the retro or rather neo-swing bandwagon. And why not Big Kahuna and Ray Anthony even got in on the retro swing movement, but most of the songs lack the more gruff blues that most of thier cd's have, accept track two which is more reminiscent of thier other recordings, a very enjoyable release nonetheless."
5,Fit as advertised,"Nice original part for my 1969 Ford Mustang Convertible, currently partially torn about, undergoing a restoration... hoping to get on the road soon."
5,Once again,Once again elliott has come out with a kick butt album. Its got a mix of their previous albums plus something new. A sure buy for any fan.
3,This is [junk].,"This album is total [junk] except for the first song. before all you elliott fans have a coniption, i am a huge elliott fan. false cathedrals might be the best album ever made. this, sounds nothing like it. waiting while under paralysis is a truely remarkable song, but everything else is complete garbage. dont buy this, download waiting under paralysis."
2,Not a SpiceGirl,"I love Red Tea and have tried several different brands and kinds. It's such a strong, rich tea I even substitute it for coffee. However, this tea is so over powered by the spice that you can't taste the tea; it's not enjoyable. Unless you like chai tea or the like, this tea is not for you!"
4,PRETTY DARNED GOOD MUSIC,"I'm one of thoes who can watch a movie or read a book over and over and over, so the more I listen to this soundtrack the more I can't wait for the release of the movie. This is one of those albums, (cd's,whatever) that makes the repeat button on my player get a severe workout, especially the song ""STRAIGHT TO THE HEART OF LOVE"""
3,Also missing...,"Also in the movie but not on the disc, Lucinda Willims' ""It's Over But I Can't Let Go"". What a great song. The music made this an enjoyable movie. There's only 14 songs on the disc, it's a shame so many good ones from the film were left off."
3,Okay,"There are a couple good songs on this album including ""The Kind in You,"" ""Kick it Into Gear"" and ""Love Can Stand the Test?"" but it's just a good album to relax to I think."
3,Looking forward to the sequel,"The soundtrack is excellent as far as it goes. It does not feature some of the best music from the movie like Rose Royce's Car Wash and Lynyrd Skynyrd's They call me the breeze. Too bad... In any case, I expect there will be a sequel to this movie and some of the biggest names will be lining up to get their music in there. That's the album I want."
5,Awesome soundtrack,"If you loved the movie then this soundtrack is a definite must buy!I personally rate the following songs as the top songs in order first to last:1. Straight to the heart of love2. Where nobody knows my name3. Let it ride4. I'm in it for the honey5. Can love stand the testSure this soundtrack might be pricey, but keep in mind that it is out of print.Even so, I still feel it is absolutey worth it."
2,mediocre,mostly forgettable generic pop/country tunes with a couple of highlights - 'Straight to the heart of love'and 'the kid in you'. Even the Bela Fleck tune is not outstanding and I'm a big Fleck fan. Could be nice if you want some non-descript light-weight country music to play in the background. If you insist on buying this mediocre cd - buy it used and real cheap or you'll be sorry.
2,Like a boatload of bloody popcorn,"As far as horror is concerned, I prefer short stories to full-length novels, but they can be TOO short. Every story in this collection is only 1-2 pages long - they have to be, to fit 365 stories in a book of reasonable size. As a result, unless you are an extremely slow reader, none of them provide enough time to build up the suspense. There are a few exceptions - some really good stories which did manage to chill me, - but they are exceptions, not the rule. Simply put, a short short story is a very difficult format in any genre, including horror, and very few writers can pull it off. Reading just one at a time, as the subtitle suggests (""Get your daily dose of terror"") leaves only the impression of ""Huh?"". Reading many at a sitting is like eating a boatload of popcorn - it felt good going down, but left you empty afterwards. Except that some of this ""popcorn"" is more than a little bloody - actual snacking while reading this book is not recommended."
1,waste of time,"To say that this is bad writing is an understatement. This is clearly the worst book I have ever read. Extremely predictable and stereotypical. It is amazing that is ever got published. In a Jr. high writing contest this ""might"" get a participation badge. In fairness there is not much you can do with a 1 to 2 page story. But even the show ""Are you afraid of the dark"" had more originality, making the author R. L. Stine seem like a literary genius by comparison. There is not that much else to say except that it makes me angry that anyone could consider is good writing."
3,"Sometimes short is too sweet, but it compensates","If you're into horror, get it. If you're not into horror, take a look at it and read few right there in the store (which is easier than it sounds since most of the stories are only about 3 pages in length, max). It's a cool collection of tales that you can kind of treat like a literary snack, a horror-d'vour, so to speak. Plus, it really helps to get you interested in the genre and reading in general; you feel as though you're accomplishing some serious reading, even if some of the stories aren't that great.There's so many stories, you really can't go wrong; there's going to be something in there for you, and if you run across a couple of stinkers, so what? They were only 3 pages long anyway!A must for writers looking to hone their voice down to a sharp point."
3,luminous color,"A new edition of the 1978 book brings this somber, wordy, story back to life with large, lush, color pastels. The story, about a boy who is given magic shoes, which take him on a dancing journey, may not have tremendous child appeal, but the luminous color will attract new readers."
4,Simple Magic,"This is the simple story about a boy who is left a pair of silver shoes by a strange man one day. The boy waits until he grows enough so that the silver shoes fit him, then he travels around the world making friends, spreading laughter and joy by dancing for people in his silver shoes. I haven't read the story in years, but the tale has always stayed with me and been a part of me. The book is humble and subdued, but its message of spreading happiness to others seeps into you like a sip of hot cocoa. A wonderful story and well worth buying and reading to any child."
3,sputtering to the end....,"roughly 2/3 of this pile of words was titilatingly engrossing. then, when the crew left for archangel, this thing fell apart. the scenics in moscow and descriptions validate harris but the stalin revelations were nonsense. too many convenient deaths up in the woods to render this book valid. of course, one needs to suspend belief but with stalin's [..] son killing special ops like snapping his fingers, my tolerance ceases.overall, a recommended read merely for the nice leadup to the ridiculous conclusion."
1,"Turgid, Contrived and Boiring","Having enjoyed Mr.Harris's imaginative and finely-observed ""Fatherland"" I came to this present work with high expectations (indeed I reserved it for light holiday reading in a remote part of Thailand). It was a major disappointment to find that this new novel is turgid and contrived. It doesn't help that it is burdened with a principal character (one hesitates to say ""hero"") who is that most hackneyed cliché of the modern thriller, in print or on celluloid, the dishevelled and hard-drinking womaniser. The writer's familiarity with modern Moscow is milked for every incidental detail possible and the linkages back to late Stalinist time are laboured to say the least. By the hundredth page I gave up in sheer boredom, totally uninterested in the further plot development or in the outcome. Can this be the same novel I read such rave reviews of? Thank Heavens I had other reading material with me on my holiday!"
4,Glimpse in Russia of the Early 90s,"Archangel is a captivating story, featuring a UK sovietologist, a US journalist and a number of Russian characters involved in some way with the search for Stalin's lost diary. The story is a well-plotted and the book a page-turner, however I liked it also for the more general comment it makes about how Stalin is perceived in the history compared to e.g. Hitler. One of the men is still quite popular in his home country, which is a scary thought (and I think unfortunately true still today). As such the thriller becomes a commentary of 20th century history and, just, a little more than a weekend thriller. Recommended."
5,Bone Chilling,"When ""Fluke"" Celtow an American reporter first hears the ravings of the old russian he is skeptical. But the more he considers the old man's story the more he is intriged. It is a mystery that goes back to the time of Stalin's death and its implications are vast.My Imprezsion-I liked the book but there are a few fatal flaws the most major of which is the fact that towards the end they wrap everything up to neatly. The idea of Stalin having a son who could carry on his ""leagecy"" is crazy but spellbinding."
2,"Interesting Premise, however it ultimately falls short.","The premise of this story is brilliant, however Harris is unable to pull it off in a convincing fashion. While it keeps your attention throughout, the ending is somewhat unrealistic and disappointing. If you are looking for an escape into a thriller this may do, however don't expect it to portray a realistic portrait of Modern Russia. Additionally, other than the main character, all of the other players are relatively superficial."
2,A good read at the beach if nothing else,"The text which starts out good enough and keeps your attention throughout, disappoints at the end with a predictable close that leaves you colder then a visit to the Russian North. The plausible and interesting twists unwind right before your eyes, leaving you wondering if your time would have been better spent counting the grains of sand under your beach chair. If you haven't read ""Gorky Park"" or any of its sequels, they are better examples of this genre and worth the time on the beach."
2,Very disappointing,"Rarely can a book have started off so well and yet ended so ridiculously. The first third of the book shows Harris at his best, conjuring up an atmosphere of suspense while skilfully interweaving the results of his prodigious homework. Who could not be enthralled by the idea of Stalin's secret notebook coming to light after 50 years? Up until the moment when our two heroes set off for the northern city of Archangel all is going fine. But then -- and I can't say much more for fear of giving away the most critical element of the plot -- the storyline suddenly veers off into the simply unbelieveable. It is hard to believe that the author who produced Fatherland could have lost the plot so entirely. The last two chapters are insultingly bad"
3,Good page-turner,A lively thriller that I found I couldn't put down. Not great literature but well-written and well-constructed enough to keep you reading long after bed-time. Very well-researched too with everything smacking of realism.
1,A waste of time and money,"Normally I buy books; this one was borrowed and I'm happy for not having spent the money.What will the next ""secret paper, hidden offspring"" blizzard of titles consist of, ""The Clinton chronicles""? Between the hackneyed plot, floridly gratuitous descriptions of everything from sounds in the halls to mid-hangover vomiting, and boring, overworked, scenarios - a total waste of time - and someone else's money.The jacket writers and critics who cite this piece of work as depicting an accurate view of the ""new"" Russia obviously didn't experience (or otherwise know) the ""old"" or ""new"" Russia.If ""Archangel"" is this author's ""third and best"", let's hope there is no fourth."
1,disappointed,"When I purchased this book through Amazon, the picture of the book cover used to represent the product was a picture of the Arrow Books edition. I have that edition already and was expecting to receive a virtually identical book. The Arrow edition has good paper, is well bound, and has readable text. What owlsbook sent me was a very poor substitute -- poor quality paper, small difficult to read font, and poorly bound, so that it is hard to keep the book open to read it. Furthermore, the front cover is torn.My experiences with Amazon Marketplace have virtually always been good, but this was an exception to that rule. I received two other books from this seller, and they were fine, but the copy of Harris's Archangel is junk."
2,"Great Start, Disappointing Conclusion","ARCHANGEL starts off with great atmosphere and detail, and the suspense builds through three-quarters of the novel. Unfortunately, the ending was contrived and absurd by comparison. It almost read as ""X-Files Visits Siberia""!"
4,Very good!,"I enjoyed this thriller very much. The action is exciting, the characters are engaging, and the portrait of Russia is chilling (if everything I've ever read about Russia is close to true, what a depressing place, full of pollution, deprivation, and misery). The critical reviews by some readers are way too harsh: sure, the ending is a bit unbelievable, but this is a good book--lighten up."
2,Hard to Follow,"The basic plot had the makings of some real intrique, but from from page 250 to the end I could not figure out where we were or what we were doing. I still cannot figure out what the ending of the book was all about and I was glad to get this read over with. I was very disappointed."
2,Just another spy novel,"Well it's more of the same isn't it. I sure enjoyed Fatherland, for it's premise and readibility more than anything else, but I read it as you watch an action film knowing that it was just a piece of well put together vacuous entertainment. The problem with Archangel is that it follows the same pattern to the letter. It's quite well researched and even clever but when it comes to plot line it's predictible and improbable. Again we follow an unlikely hero with nothing to lose in a race against the badies to expose them and save the world. I'm affraid Harris doesn't move an inch from the premise that he so succesfully exploited in Fatherland. And as for the characters they're flat and inhuman just the sort of thing you would find in cheap spy novels which at the end of the day is what this is. A much hiped second rate spy novel, as entertaining as inofensive."
4,Another great novel,"I have already read Fatherland and Pompeii by Robert Harris. Both of these books are some of the best reading I have ever done in my entire life. Archangel can now be added to that list of favorite novels. It keeps you on the edge of your seat, and when you pick it up and start reading, it keeps you interested from front cover to the back cover. It is just plain intense. I would suggest this book as well as Fatherland and Pompeii to anyone who is interested in anything historical. I love detailed and how much research Harris does on historical facts... it shows."
2,This Book was O.K.,"Archangel started out as good novel, but the author couldn't keep it up. There was too much down time and not enough action or mystery. The book overall is not very exciting. And the ending was rushed and incomplete. The author could have expanded more and made a better story. I felt as though he didn't have courage enough to finish the story. This book fell short of my expectations and I would not recommend on the fact that the ending will disappoint any reader."
5,Another Great Read!,"This book is great because it makes you think about his subject. Harris poses the question: Who is the greatest villian of the twentieth century and provides a convincing answer. Like Enigma and Fatherland, these are not ideas easily dismissed."
4,"Loved the book, but for one niggling problem...","I loved this book, even the ending others have found ridiculous or straining credibility. It was a flight of historical fantasy, yes, but it is not impossible and a riveting story. But there's one flaw that's bothered me in the months since I read it - Fluke passes the stadium where Russia is playing somebody in soccer. The game is tied, goes into overtime, and ends 3-2. But hey! International soccer goes into overtime very, very rarely - only in certain playoff matches - and tied games end tied 99% of the time. This could have been the 1997 Italy-Russia playoff, but that didn't go into overtime. Was this just an edit made for Americans? Or did Harris really not know how the game works? Either way, I found that to be a bothersome, insulting part of an otherwise excellent novel."
2,good but slow,"Robert Harris is a good writer. He describes the place and emotion well. The first part is very exciting, that's why I got this book. As you continue, the description of the place is good. The suspense is there,you'll feel Russia with all its secrets, the politics,power and corruptions of the past and present rulers over its people and the struggle of everyday people. The plot is good, the secret documents of Stalin. But , about midway towards the end, it lost its drive. I find it hard to finish the book, but I finished it. It drags."
4,Robert Harris. Among the elite in thriller wrtiting.,"Robert Harris, Archangel. Purchased at the airport in Sydney in Nov. for my return travel to Europe. It took some time to get into the book, but when I did I could feel as I almost was there together with Fluke.A very good plot, very in much in time with the world scene. When I closed the book, 10 to 11 hours had pased and I said to my self, oh great, I am nearly home. 11 hours of booring flight is gone. As good as Fredrick Forsythe,Robert Ludlum,Ken Follett and Colin Forbes."
2,Dissapointingly average,"The subject matter of this book is intriguing. Harris outlines the role of the past in modern Russia acutely, and illustrates well the conflict that this brings. The plot develops slowly and peaks all too quickly however, without ever generating suspense. Harris leaves his characters desperately undeveloped (with the exception of O'Brian), distancing the reader rather coldly from the events. Lacking style and flair, this is a novel that never really fulfills its potential."
1,Unbelievably bad,"Although I enjoyed his first two books, this one is a complete waste of time. The plot is convoluted and ridiculous. The characters are so poorly drawn you can barely keep them straight in your mind. And the ending is so ludicrous that it's laughable. If you're looking for thrillers, there are a lot better books out there."
2,"Nowhere close to ""Pompeii""...","If you are considering this item because you have enjoyed the author's excellent ""Pompeii: A Novel"" - forget it. This book is not only quite inferior to ""Pompeii"" in terms of the quality of research and the breadth of the story, but also the ""Archangel"" is - simply put - rather boorish, dragged-out and disjoint. Considering the number of half-developed characters, the number of half-cooked sub-plots completely irrelevant to the story, and a rather illogical ending, a reader cannot shake the feeling that this book was supposed to be twice as long, but the author himself got completely bored of it all half along the way, retroactively inserted a dozen events to make a quick conclusion possible, and abandoned his work."
2,dont waste your time,"i read fatherland and thought it was a very entertaining and involving book. this book was convoluted, the characters were hard to follow, and ultimately the story was not that interesting. there are too many books out there to waste your time with this one. i am annoyed with myself for finishing it."
4,Great Read,"this was a great read - i learned alot about stalinist russia - and had alot of fun with the plot - for a thriller, i thought the writing was definitely above average, and the main characters Kelso, O'Brian, and Savourin(sp.?) were extremely well drawn. I had alot of fun with this book - Great airplane read but way above level of normal thriller writers."
2,It Don't Fit,"I have both a Skill, and a Craftsman 1/4"" router. This rabbeting bit that I purchased was supposed to have a 1/4"" shank, and it looked like it did. However, it would not fit into either collet. All of my other bits do. Does this mean all of my other bits are just a little smaller than 1/4"", or is the Woodline bit just a little bit larger. A little judicious work with the bench grinder got it to fit, but that can be dangerous if you don't know what you're doing. But, it did cut the rabbets nice and clean, so it wasn't a complete waste, and they may not all be that way. I'll try one more bit from Woodline before I decide to keep buying from them or not."
2,waterman phileas ballpoint pen,"Waterman phileas ballpoint pen: The clip and end piece are nicely plated. The pen body appears to be a cheap plastic or inferior acrylic. The balance seems top heavy and writing a long time with it would be a challenge. Over all this is a $5 pen. I seen nicer promotional pens that write better. The G2 pilot pro I ordered for $5,that Amazon carries, is a much better pen and you can modify a mont blac refill with a small sissor cut and slip it right into the G2 pro, making it write like a thousand dollar pen. For the $25 with shipping, this Waterman isn't worth buying and I was a bit disappointed. I have bought custom handmade beautiful exotic hand crafted pens online for this price which is a much better investment. Sour grapes to Waterman for this pen."
4,My five-year old daughter just loves this album.,"This album is a nice way to let your children know what kind of music you loved when you were their age. Although the lyrics are the same as 'our Abba', the music and choreography are certainly different and very attractive, even to young people. Even my daughters (3 and 5 years old) adore this album!"
5,Best Abba Re-make,I picked this single up in Amsterdam this summer when it was first released. Their version of Mamma Mia is the best that I've heard since the original. They've taken the best of 70's and 90's disco and merged them into one great sound.
4,Great Remake!,"A lot of times when young groups remake a song it never adds up to the original. But I think the ""A Teens"" have a lot of energy and give this song a new take. I picked it up while visiting Sweden but I was wondering if anyone knew how I can get their full lenght CD here in America. Let me know..."
1,A COMPLETE BOOTLEG!!!! DO NOT BUY,"This product is an absolute bootleg and should not be purchased mainly because the money goes directly to criminals! I am the artist and I did not approve of this product ever to be released! We are in the process now of filing charges against any individual or company that fails to ceast and desist selling the product unauthorized including Amazon! Thankyou, Al Di Meola"
3,Where's the USB port???,"AIGH!!! I wanted a USB port so bad so I could record my mp3s onto minidiscs, but sadly I couldn't. It's a shame that it doesn't have a USB port so you can fully tap into the minidisc power.The battery doesn't quite last 7 hours. It lasts about 5 1/2 hours straight through, without turning off. It's good, but somedays you want that full 7 hours. This player has wonderful sound, better than a CD player. And it doesn't skip nearly as easy as a CD player. If it gets jostled a little too much, it does stop but it doesn't skip any note. Worth the money, even without the USB port."
2,Think twice before purchasing,"I just purchased this player, and for the most part it works fine; however, I did have some difficulties recording. My first few attempts of recording a CD to MD resulted in many skips.Do some research on the internet. Apparently, I am not allowed to post a URL on my review, but there are discussion boards on Minidisc players. I found a site that had about 15 complaints about this devices problems with recording. They ranged from skipping, to errors to problems not being able to recognize certain brands of minidiscs.I suggest buyers to spend a bit more and find a more reliable product."
1,why me?,"the first time i bought this md player, it would not record usingthe optical line in jack. so i returned it and bought a new one.which i was excited to have. all of the sudden, one day, i putin my nice clean disc, and the player said, ""no disc"". what?so i tried a different one, and it said ""can't read a"". so itdoesn't do anything!!! i have all these mini discs, and noneof them will play. i don't know why. i will not buy this playera 3rd time. hopefully i will be able to get my $ back.thanks."
4,?,hey i have a really important question. i heard alota good things about this md palyer and i wanted 2 find out if i could record my mp'3 onto the mini disc palyer with the cords they give u or do u need to buy new cords somewahre else?? and if i need to buy new ones where can i buy them or do i have to get a different mini disc player?
2,we need more choices,"... this sharp only offers 10sec skip protection... the new sony's not only offer 40+, but have new recording speeds so you can record more minutes on one disc, much like vcr speed. Waite until amazon offers the newer models."
4,"ok price, good md for beginner","I originally wanted the Sharp md 821. ... sold out and never got anymore. So the next affordable md was this one. It records md's and you can listen to them and thats about it. Not many extras.The thing i like about this md is that i can grab a freind's cd player and burn tracks from him. Or just get a cd and record favorite tracks from computer.But what i don't like about it is that after a full recharge the battery only last no more than about 4 hours.If you record without adapter...about 2 hours.Also the paint comes of the remote.It was my first md.Overall i like it alot.It fits in ur pocket unlike bulky cd players.I want something with more features,..."
5,Sync mode can be turned off. Unit is fine for live recording,"An earlier review (July 9, 2002 by ""an electronics fan"") states that ""you can't turn off sync mode."" This is not true. You can record from any source, including a microphone, with or without sync mode.When I first read the July 9th user review, I almost refrained from buying the SR60 because I intended to use it for live recording. Fortunately, I did a little more research (you can even download the user manual from ...) and was glad to learn that the unit would be suitable for my purposes.I recently purchased an SR60 and have not been disappointed. It does an excellent job of recording live music."
4,good 1st MD player/recorder - good for live recordings,this is my first MD player. i've been looking at them for a year and am mainly intersted in using it to record live concerts. i received it last monday and recorded my first show on tuesday. the sharp was a dream to use. it's manual level settings allow you to adjust the rec. levels on the fly without interrupting your recording (sony's aren't as friendly this way). this feature aids in capturing the performance and hushing the crowd noise between songs. the user manual was also very helpful in regards to determining what levels to use for recording and basic product use. you can't argue with the price either. the $ i saved on this little gem allowed me to spend a lot more on quality microphones so my recording sounded as good as many of the bootlegs i have that were fueled by high end DATs & nice pro-cardioid mics.
2,"DON""T BUY THIS PRODUCT","At first, I loved this thing. I mean, I got it for a great price and it came with all this cool stuff. However, after about a month, I started noticing how cheap this product was. I mean, it would skip as I was walking. Now that I know how cheaply made this product is, I wish that I spent the little extra cash to get a good quality MD or even an mp3 player. I made a bad mistake and you shouldn't make the same mistake either."
3,get what you pay for,"this mini disk player works good as long as you are care full.don't ""beat it up"" like i did. after a year of having it the stop button dosen't work any more.p.s. i'd recomend a mp3 player only cause it dosent skip but i still like the quality sound it records better than a mp3 player."
1,mine was defective,i recently purchased one of these minidisk player/recorders and it was great for about the first month. After that it stoped recording and then stoped playing and then would not even read my disks.I strongly recomend that you do not purchase itColin
1,not good compared to sony,ok for true musiic lovers and for those of u who are always downloading mp3's u dont want this u want a minidisc player with mdlp (minidisc long play technolgy) it lets u play 5 hours of music per disc and sonys have longer battery life up to 63 hours check out the mz-r900dpc [...] it is top of the line but for the price if u are a true muic lover it is worth the price or if not get one of the lesser modelsthat they offer there or here
2,"Lots of energy, still hate the band though","Linkin Park is terrible but I have to admit that this concert had a lot of energy and that's why I gave it 2 stars. The funny thing about this world is so many retarded people go to Linkin Park concerts (I know, I was there for some some reason). Their guitar riffs aren't as repetative (same songs, different chords) but they are still pretty retarded if they think they can get away with such crappy drumming, bass playing and singing. Rapping was not as bad as I thought it would be, maybe they changed the songs a little before the concert. Don't buy this unless you really like sausage links, err.. I mean Linkin Park (in which case you're retarded). See ya."
3,could have been way better,why they made this DVD I don't know why first there is no big crowd looks really dead and second it was like daytime just did'nt make it feel right. would have gotten 1 to 2 stars if it wasn't for linkin park the songs are great just not the setting.
1,Dreadful DVD,"I own a lot of live DVDs and this has to be one of the worst. Chester can't hold his vocals, the crowd seems disinterested and the whole thing looks so phony. Even pleading from the band can't seem to get the crowd going. I still like Linkin Park but will stick to their studio work. Seemed to me that with limited energy from band and crowd, a smaller crowd and venue would have been a better choice for a live album. Many empty seats in the Texas stadium.Save your $$ or buy a real live album like RATM at the Olympic. Now that's a metal/hip hop concert that ROCKS!"
2,Ok for what it is...,"This concert is effectively a reproduction of their studio work, and its decent. However, the atmosphere and audience engagement just isnt there, which in my opinion spoils what vibe they could actually bring. One thing I hate is when people say they've got talent... they have virtually none, bar they're ability to write a radio-friendy, ""i'm so hardcore man,"" song for the masses. If you want to see real talent, check out Dream Theater, (and their new live DVD)...that is what its about! On a positive note they do play most of their good songs off Hybrid Theory (IMO Meteora all sounds the same and is terrible anyway), and the mix is not bad. But the bottom line is if you want to be a sheep who follows mainstream not-even-half-decent music, this is for you, but otherwise, steer clear, and find some quality music instead."
1,Worst Concert DVD I Have Heard,"Ok, their songs sound pretty good on albums....for obvious reasons. Thats ok once you get past the repetitive, emo, my girlfriend makes me cry lyrics. So I was very interested in how they were going to pull off a live performance without all that help they get in the studio.Crash and Burn. The songs sound exactly like the album, there is no crowd noise or cheering because they couldnt use ambient microphones. Why? Because the singer has to have loads of effects on his voice just to sound decent. So there is no live feel at all. I think most of the instruments have backing tracks. There is no jamming. No improv. Its a joke. This is the worst concert DVD I have seen. If they would find a singer who can sing and write, they would be pretty good. Unless you are a pathetic fan-boy, stay away from this one."
4,Finally a Live CD/DVD,"It took them 4 years, but it's finally here. Nothing defines a band more than their live performance, and fans of Linkin Park will not be disappointed. The CD/DVD combo is nice, as live performances are better watched than just listened to. Linkin Park is just as intense live with their music. The energy level is high, and it is maintained throughout the performance. Those who are not LP fans may even want to check this one out. It's an awesome value."
5,ELECTRIFYING!!!!!,"Hi!I'm vincent from mauritius and i would like to say that linkin park is the most electrifying group that i know.wherever in studio for audio recording or peforming on stage,they just rock!!!!!For those who are ready to rock and to welcome the new era in the world of music,please.........watch this dvd........now!!!!!!!"
3,live in texas,the live in texas dvd was great i saw those people in the moshpit they were fighting and pushing and hitting each other and punching and chester and rob was hot and that boy in place for my head in live in texas was like drew carey and he was hot too i paused the boys i like was cute too in the pit and the pit was awful they were bouncing up and down at don't stay runaway and crawling and one step closer the guys in the moshpit took their shirts off at figure.09 and put over their heads
3,DVD is average.,"I like to purchase DVD's of live concerts of certain bands to see if their live performance is up to snuff when compared to the bands CD release with studio enhanced audio. I will go see them in concert and get my monies worth.Have you ever had this happen to you:Sometimes a band's CD sounds awesome and you are hyped to go see them, but when you seem them live they stink up the place. (Trapped) You have to leave!If you have not seen LP in concert,then this concert footage should hold you over until then."
3,"CD great, DVD not so much...","I really enjoyed the sound quality on both the CD and the DVD. Though I have never seen the group live, this was a good substitute, sonically. The DVD was watched in Dolby 5.1, and had excellent sound.Visually, the DVD was underwhelming. There were absolutely no shots of the entire stage because it was not shot from an audience member's perspective. The camera work was, at times, nauseating because there was way too much movement going on. Too bad a more experienced director was not in charge of this effort. The DVD captures the energy of the band, but there should have been more alteration between extreme close-ups of band members and their instruments (way too much of that) and a wider panoramic view that would give us the audience's perspective."
5,Love Linkin Park?...,"Great price for a good video (early years), and includes a good CD tracks. Its older now, but I still love this album."
4,Impressive,"Linkin Park is one of the best bands now, and definitely one of the best live bands ever, they're the only band that i've heard in while that sounds like they are giving 100% at every show, most bands on tour, get really tired, and they start to slow down on stage at the end of the tour, Linkin Park might be the same but they don't show it. Great DvdI subtracted a star from this because i didn't like the Cd, because i was expecting all 18 songs on the Cd, because if you can't watch the whole dvd at some time, whats better then to listen to it in your car or on a school bus. So the cd is a little lacking but the Dvd has great power and is a great dvd from LP."
3,Something missing?,"I love both Linkin Park studio albums. However, when I go to a live show (or watch one on DVD), I don't necessarily want a note for note reproduction of the studio album. That's pretty much what you get from this performance. Don't get me wrong, the performances are strong, and the band sounds tight. I guess I'd prefer a little bit of improvisation, or maybe it's something else that isn't tangible.If you like hearing a band play their songs (all great songs) the same way they are on the album, this DVD is for you. If you like a little improvisation and showmanship, perhaps you should give this a pass (or rent it first to see if you like it)."
3,Good collection but sound quality is a slight issue,"If you have a group of friends like I do, then you'll want to get this good British Invasion collection for parties and events where you want a long cd of 60s music. With 25 songs, it will keep you from running back to the cd player to pop in a new cd. The sound quality could have been better, but if you're listening at a party or on a road trip it won't be a big deal.Some notable surprises are the cool version of I Put a Spell on You by the Alan Price Set, and You Turn Me On by Ian Whitcomb and Bluesville (goofy but soulful in a jangly way...)."
3,In line tubing bender.,"Shipped and received promptly. I would have wanted to know it doesn't do a real good job of holding the tubing during flaring. I would have wanted to know the interior of the flare wasn't nice and smooth and that the very ends of the flared tubing are too rough. It makes a ""usable"" flare not a good usable flare."
5,Graceful Grace,"Books can be about Enlightenment, but can a book itself be Enlightened? I don't know, but this book comes as close as any could. Every page is a work of art devoted to illustrating different aspects of Enlightenment, as embodied in Sri Sri Ravi Shankar. This book has many gifts to give, why not receive them?"
3,Garnet is really darker then what I got,"The ring itself is very pretty, delicate looking an eye catching if you have no other rings on the same hand. However, Garnet is my birthstone and I know how dark red Garnet is to be. This maybe a series of garnet stones but they are very light in color. That is my main complaint. Other then that, the ring is beautiful."
2,Dull,"The quality and the stone setting were good, but the color was dull orange-red and not very easily visible against a tanned skin tone. Not worth it, if you are expecting a deeper rich colored garnet gemstone."
2,I didn't like it.,"The garnets are pink, not a deep red like I expected. I personally don't like it. Otherwise, it is a nicely made ring. Also, I am a size 5 and the 7 stones are just too much they hit the sides of my other fingers."
1,Animals only work for a few days,"The piano is really cute, and we were excited to give it to our one year old on her birthday. However, even after replacing the batteries time and time again, the piano is the only part that worked about a week after giving it to her, the animals do not move anymore, so she would get very upset when she anticipated their movements and nothing happened. I can't seem to get ahold of anyone in customer service or get a correct contact email, so I can't tell them. I won't buy an iplay product again."
2,Super Cheap and Cheesy,"We love music at our house. This ""piano"" was a complete joke! First off, the animals stopped moving when you push a key. BUT, if you drop it or shake it they start to work again...The sound is not great, and my one year old lost interest in about 47 seconds. Save your money on this cheap toy..."
4,"catchy, nice sound, entertaiining","purchased this for my one year old. Great cause and effect with touch of various keys mimicking sounds of different instruments. Also, the animials move when the music is played. I like the fact that she can still play ""free style"" if she chooses"
2,Sounds nothing like a piano,"Sounds like an electric toy rather than a piano. My 10 month old does love the spinning animals on top, though. And, she thinks the pre-recorded ""songs"" are great fun. I can't play a thing, though, because the thing is so useless as a keyboard/piano."
2,Where's the Beef!,I was disappointed in this short book. I wanted more information regarding how a 29 degree planet works in the natal chart as I have one which is aspected by many other planets. It left me with more questions then answers.
4,a fine tea book,"I like to read books while sipping tea. Nothing is better than a book on tea while sipping tea. Its hard to believe the other reviewer gave this book 1 star with the advice, buy another book intstead as if its an ultimatum. This is a great book, well done and very engaging while brewing a cup or two. My personal favorite books on tea beyond the primary sources in Chinese and Japanese are Wind in the Pines and Tea of the Sages, the Art of Sencha and this book is worthy to share a on the shelf with any English book on tea. Self-important scholars, aesthetes or ""intellectuals"" like the first reviewer do not seem to ""taste"" this authors flavor at all."
4,A LAUGH-OUT-LOUD EXTRAVAGANZA!,"Words fail me! After watching ""Russkie Bez Rosii"" for the fifth time, I am again stunned by the comedic genius of producer Nikita Mikhalkov (""It's A Mad Mad Mad Mad World"", and ""Kolchak: The Night Stalker""). The only drawback to this magnificent film is the exclusion of my favorite Russian comedians, Yakov Grot and Olga Korbut.The scene where Boris Spassky is unwittingly seduced by Anna Kournikova -- disguised as an inebriated Peter Sellers! -- is alone worth the hefty price of this DVD. Surely it can't get better than this!A well-deserved four stars, only because the color transfer was slightly off during the snowy scenes."
1,Very unimportant research.,"This dissertation investigations problems of the mate-in-two variety, and shows that a few heuristics that correspond to the human concept of ""beauty"" tend to reduce solution times (10% to 33%). My disappointment arises because this is not a difficult problem; there isn't a chess program on the marketplace that can't solve mate-in-N problems in the blink of an eye. Furthermore, the advantage obtained through these heuristics is very minor; on a small sample of positions it is always possible to tune one's chess engine to obtain comparable speed-ups. My conclusion is that the author's time at the University of Sussex was not well spent."
5,An excellent book - ideal for games AI programmers,"This is a very original book, well researched and full of insight into computer chess heuristics. It helped me understand how computers play chess, and how 'boring' and unoriginal the current 'search' type programs are. This book is more about 'real AI', rather than just fast chess search algorithms. It does go into *some* detail on general AI in games, but concentraits mainly on chess.Ive since written my own chess heuristics to incorporate into the accompanying program. The author was very helpful with this, and responded to my emailed questions!"
3,"Good, but could be better.","An interesting read, but don't agree that Beauty is the factor that makes a chess player better. The eight concepts quoted from Margulies do not always help the computer play chess in a more human way. I think the human chess player has more principles used. For example, setting traps, pins and using combos. The human is more creative and doesn't use Beauty as described in the book to determine his/her actions. It is a far cry from playing like Fischer. This just shows how much more we have yet to explore in human learning and cognition."
4,Focused Absurdity,"Nmperign's 2nd is a good indication of where the future of improvised music is headed. Sharp, crystalline fractures of sound, with fragments of disembodied melody meted out in small amounts. ""Laughter of Birds Bloody Mud"" adds tapeloop maestro Jason Lescalleet creating a dense wall of disintegrating noise, while the guests on ""The Moon Is A Clear Mark of Midnight"" (shakuhachi and percussion) make for an almost orchestral lushness. I managed to catch them live in NYC months back and their live set was really tight. Given their focus and seriousness onstage, I thought they might be a bit pretentious, but I talked with them a bit after the show and in fact they are ridiculous characters (showing a mild predilection for off-color humor and absurd antics)! Great stuff - check it out!"
3,Good start to the day,"I've been reading one of the meditations a day for roughly 4 months now. Overall, it's a pretty good book.Sometimes the meditations are more autobiographical than suits my taste. While having a story associated with the concept helps illustrate the point, having that story be the author's sometimes seems a bit self-indulgent. It would have been more enjoyable for me if the author had either invented a situation to illustrate the point, or referred to someone else's story.This being said, most of the daily thoughts are interesting and thought-provoking. Recent quotes have reminded me to think in various ways about my life: to openly share my experience with someone close to me; to be open to hear my loved one's experience; and, when a situation is not to my liking, to search for a something that is better for me and for others involved.Overall, I've enjoyed the book."
5,Start your day right!,"I really enjoy reading the daily meditations in Peaceful Living at the beginning or end of my day. As a busy health care professional, communication is critical to the success of my encounters with patients. Peaceful Living has provided me with helpful insights that have enabled me to be more effective and compassionate in my work.Dee Kaserer, Family Nurse Practitioner"
5,Very Happy With This Fig,"It's a little more expensive buying this way (because of shipping), but it was worth it. The tree arrived quickly, very well packed, and turned out to be a very healthy plant."
4,Worth checking out!!!,"An interesting plot, creatively mixing the old and the new. Three curious college students end up with more adventure than they were seeking when a college project becomes too real. The story holds your attention as you wander through the classics and the northern Atlanta suburbs building nicely to the surprise ending. A fun read."
1,Stay away,"1st of all, the tablets don't dissolve by themselves, you have to crush them by hand, regardless of how hot the water is. I used it on couple of non-stick pots and the black coating peeled in many spots rendering them unusable! And, yes, I did follow the directions word by word. Stay away!"
2,Pan eater,"I bought this in hopes that it would make my pans look like new. Well it did get some of the grim off, but it also took the paint off my pan and put a perm. ring in my stainless steel sink. My non stick pans have dried out and now I have to replace them because they are starting to peel.I would stay away from this one."
5,"Poignant, Genuine and Honest","This book is the true story of a woman who becomes suicidal when her young husband suffers from Lou Gehrig's disease and dies. The auther is exceedingly honest and open about her thoughts and feelings and reactions during this time in her life. And she details the therapy that finally turned her life around. It's a compelling, gripping story and a must-read for anyone who wants to understand the loss of a spouse due to a terminal condition, suicidal depression, childhood abuse, and the healing from it all."
1,dying to self...a dialogue,"When I opened the book I was shocked that each page had been photocopied 4x4,and the writing was so small you almost needed a magnifying glass to read it. I have never experienced anything like it.I felt very embarrassed to know that I had been duped!"
2,Not for an experienced professional...,"I got absolutely nothing out of this book, and I doubt anyone else will either unless they have very little experience interviewing. It might be a good book for high school graduates, or socially backward college graduates, but anyone who's had more than three job interviews will find it lacks insight and is terribly boring.I had to force myself to read the whole thing, which is pretty sad since it's a very short book. The only thing that kept me going was the thought that I can't review it in good faith if I haven't read the whole thing!"
3,Ok...,"This is a very good book with many ideas on interviews and related etiquette, but unfortunately it just goes over the same things again and again. It could've been cut in half easily, without any important information lost. But this is a minor complaint - I can't wait to try out principles described in the book in a real-life interview."
3,"It makes a decent KVM, but don't plan on using it over IP as intended!","This product does not include a web interface. To access it over IP you must use their software. The software is not included and they charge THOUSANDS for a license! You must also purchase the network dongles separately. I am hoping that someone will create an open source software that works with this, now that the hardware is readily available and inexpensive."
5,Worth the extra money,We love this product. It takes up a little more space than we would like but this is a nice product. It is darker than what appears on the websites you see which is what we wanted. It is worth every penny!
1,Let Mr.Herzher reside in this piece of JUNK!,"The ONLY good thing about this item is that is better than average looking. My 7 lb. Maltipoo CHEWED through the plastic spindley strappings, which are supposed to hold this thing together. I absolutely DO NOT recommend ANYONE buying this for their pet."
3,"Looks great, but too tasty","Like other reviewers, I was very happy when I received Mr. Herzher's Pet Residence. It looked great in place of the old wire crate I'd been using for my lab. Later the same day I crated her and ran a few errands. I was gone for about an hour. When I cam home, she had chewed a large hole in one of the side panels. This dog has not chewed anything else in my house (other than her toys), so I was really surprised. Although I found an online source for replacement panels, I've put the crate in storage for now. If your dog chews at all, this is a waste of money!"
1,Great for dogs wearing mittens,"Update - The manufacturer shipped a replacement panel for $30. I then went to the local hardware store and picked up some chicken wire to make sure Bogey doesn't remodel again.Our 9 lb Papillon with a bum front leg made short work of this crate after about 2 months of use. I guess once he figure out the plastic was easy to get at, he got after it. He's not a chewer and he's been crate trained since we got him 3 years ago. They really need some cross bars to prevent this sort of thing. It's a nice looking crate but it obviously is flawed.See the proud rascal and his carnage here - http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/B0017IVOZO/ref=cm_ciu_pdp_images_allThat was done between 8:00AM and lunch.I just hope I can get a replacement for the side panel and find someway to secure the sides so I don't have to throw this expensive item in the trash."
5,Love this crate,"I bought the large pet residence for my 4 month old already crate trained golden retriever. I am very pleased with it. It is a very attractive looking crate and sits right next to the bed as an over sized bedside table. The outer frame (so far) seems sturdy enough to hold an acrylic or glass top so I am able to put my lamp and clock, etc. right there but I shouldn't recommend doing this. This crate would fit anywhere in my home though so I'm thrilled. We even took it with us on vacation in our SUV instead of buying a collapsible travel crate. Two minor issues to note would be that in order to open and close the crate you will need to use two hands simultaneously and the bottom pan has many grooves so you need a thick pad in the bottom."
3,Rusty Mr. Herzher's Pet Residence,"Bought two of these Pet Residences, they arrived on time. The packaging was not good as they were shipped in their original boxes with no outer layer, so the boxes were torn.One of the crates was in perfect condition and as expected, but the other had rust on the bottom metal layer and it seems that it was not quality control inspected as it had paint covering the screw areas which meant I had to scrape the paint off so the screws go in. My expectation was much higher for a product at this price and particularly one that also sells at Frontgate. They look good but as I said my expectation was really higher than what was delivered, and I really did not think I will receive a rusty product.Mr. Herzher's Extra Large Pet Residence, Dark Brown"
4,A good combination,"I understand A.Stribling's review, from his point of view, but I do disagree. If one were looking specifically for recording of Budd's lovely atmospheric piano work, then there are other titles one should look at.But I find, in this case, that Budd's lilting piano melodies and treatments, combined with Bernocchi's light but funky rhythms, work well to combat what can sometimes be boring in both artist's work...in the context of a 50 + minute sitting, I mean. I don't mean to imply that either are boring as a rule, just that it's rather nice to hear them in a context in which they can play a bit of 'tag team'.I would recommend many of Budd's recordings, to be sure, including this one, which functions as both meditative and suitable for more focused listening as well."
3,I wish Any Way That You Want Me Was Remastered on this CD,"I have always been intrigued by Evie Sands. So much talent and a beautiful voice. I believe many more people would buy this CD is they only knew of her 60s talent and ""almost"" successes. Its a shame so much of her early stuff (Angel of the Morning) never hit the airways. You should consider remastering some of her early music -- Angel of the Morning, Any Way That You Want Me, etc. -- those hits will never become outdated. I am in desparate need of finding Any Way That You Want Me on CD or tape -- please help!"
3,Good to hear Evie again!,"The duet with Lucinda Williams is dynamite! It's good to hear Evie making her own music again. She is truly one of the greatest and most underappreciated pop/blues artists of our time. If there are any more Evie Sands fans out there, I'm desperate for a copy (vinyl) of ""Sands of Time""."
5,3 greats together,"I just recently got this album and i must say that i am highly impressed.... pluse prefuse, diverse and mosdef on one album.... with a tribue to rjd2.... life doesn't get much better...."
2,Needs professional installation,"This is a high quality bridge which needs to be professionally installed and for whatever reason, this major detail is not obvious nor well advertised. Professional installation and filing is recommended, but not everyone lives near a convenient and affordable luthier and searching music forums can give you tips on filing string grooves on your own (many players don't file them at all). I filed my own grooves which was easy enough with some jewelers files; however another major issue I discovered is that the bridge causes your action to be so high that deeper grooves must be filed, which takes a while. Had I known all this, I wouldn't have purchased this bridge."
4,very good documentary on miles' music,"as above! it is better than the miles davis story. there should really be a five part documentary on miles's music to be all encompassing. someone will head that project someday, maybe i will who knows??!!-kt"
5,RIGHT NEXT TO THE ORIGINAL,This soundtrack is VERY GOOD! It is worth your money! The theme is AWSOME! THE BEST THEME SINCE THE ORIGINAL IN 78! it also ties the theme in to the other tracks just at the right time! GOOD WORK LUX! BUY THIS
4,"A fine new ""Halloween"" soundtrack","The new ""Halloween"" film is a mixed bag, but you can't knock the soundtrack, a sleek, genuinely scary score that's more frightening than anything in the actual movie. I'm gaining a lot of respect for the composer Danny Lux, who also provides the music for ""Boston Public"" and did for ""Ally McBeal""(now cancelled, sniff, sniff). While it's not the best soundtrack-- that would be the 20th anniversary edition of the original, with the ""Halloween II"" album an appropriate second-- it's a fine addition and better than the last, ""Portrait of Terror"" by John Ottman, which is essentially the ""H20"" soundtrack, more or less. (Not to knock that one, either.) On a weird closing note, those creepy female vocals from ""Rest Stop"" on ""Portrait"" show up inexplicably in the movie ""Resurrection,"" with no music credit for Ottman in the credits."
4,Good product.,"Nice product. Batteries have already worked for a long time even when I sometimes don't turn it off. The only problem is that somtimes it takes quite a long time to get in touch with the computer. Sometimes it just doeasn't. Besides this problem, everything worked just fine."
4,Just Great !,"Exactly what I was looking for .. bluetooth laser mouse with VAIO logo and modern beautiful look.There is only 1 thing (RANGE) that's why i gave it 4 and not 5 stars but it was a great deal ,i recommend this for VAIO owners."
1,Sony has taken a turn for the worst,"This item was broken when I received it, just like their three hundred dollar speakers that were also broken out of the box.My real mistake though, was buying directly from Sony. They are the absolute WORST when it comes to returns or anything service related. They want to sell you and forget you."
1,Total waste of money,"This bluethooth mouse connected once, normally, and has yet to work again! I would expect that Sony's products would work together, but my new VIAO with Vista won't see it no matter what you try. Sony support is beyond awful, so it's a cluster.Maybe bluetooh's day will come for peripherals, but for now my $20 radio mouse works perfectly every time. I am sure this is a Vista compatibility issue, so hopefully they'll patch it one of these days. In the near term, save your money"
4,Excellent Bluetooth Mouse,"This is an excellent bluetooth mouse. I have had my Dell laptop with Bluetooth built in for some time now. I finally realized that I could eliminate ""dongles"" and cords and get one of these. Since there really isn't a huge selection available yet for Bluetooth mice, this was the clear cut winner. And it has not disappointed. Set up was quick and easy. Now I don't have to do anything and everytime I turn my computer on the mouse is already connected. The only problem is battery life. It seems to have only lasted a couple weeks. I think that I am supposed to actually turn the mouse off when I am done using it. This is definitely a 4.5 out of 5 stars."
5,Highly recommend,Great analysis. The author has an outstanding clear grasp of scripture. I enjoyed greatly and highly recommend this classic book.
4,Comprehensive study of real estate investment practices,"Comprehensive study of real estate investment practices and techniques. Includes in-depth descriptions on standard investment measures such as NOI, IRR, Cash flow and expense analysis, tax considerations, etc. Subject matter is very detailed and may require some prvious real estate experience to fully benefit from the material."
5,A late 60s classic in any language,"This album is wonderful. Fans of Jacques Brel, Scott Walker, (and more obviously) Bob Dylan and Leonard Cohen should give it a listen. De Andre's songwriting on this album is superior to most of these, as is his wonderfully expressive voice. My rudimentary Italian tells me the lyrics are beautifully poetic, and the sound is a heady combination of authentic European/Italian folk and the delicious orchestral excesses of the late 60s. ""Cantico Dei Drogati"" and ""Inverno"" are two highlights. De Andre is a one-off, and this is one of his best albums."
4,Excellent Relationship Management Methodology,This book is practical and very helpful for relationship management at home and work. It is far more practical than MBTI. The beauty is in its simplicity. I have taken 2 courses that used the concepts of 4 quadrants...I loved and enjoyed each one.I purchased 3 books so I could give them out to our Human Resources Department as a resource.
3,You Go Girl!,"Its about time she has come out with something. I didn't know that she was that talented. This cd was a must buy for me. I have always liked DJ Rap.Ever since I saw her spin at a party in Baltimore a few fall's ago. She's sexy and attractive. This cd did it for me. I gave her a three star because it had a little bit of rock-n-roll and metal twist a little, some of the songs. She sounds a lot better than some of these sorry new bands they have out now, no examples. But MISS DJ RAP you GO GIRL!"
3,Hmmmm,"She definately had some major help with the production but this one's pretty bland. The first two cuts (beside sounding almost identical) sound like a mediocre Danielle Dax interpretation. Rap is an amazing turntable stylist; unfortunately, this doesn't always translate to the world of disc making."
2,Kinda (...) Bad,"(...)This CD is sub-par. Most of the beats are cool, but they're overlayed with too many cheesy lyrics."
1,I want to like this album,"It's the classic CD buyer's remorse: the first track sounds good at the listening station, and so do the openings for the next few tracks... now why don't I buy this and listen to it in my car, before I have the whole thing spoiled for me in the record store?I have given it several attempts, and I can hardly stand to listen to more than one minute of any track of ""Learning Curve."" The lyrics are insipid, the beats unimaginative, and the composition seems to be an afterthought. Save your money."
2,Queen of D&B or Spicegirl?,"I believe that the fact this woman used to be a topless dancer is one drawback for a serious career. But any woman with enough talent could overcome that sort of stigma and be appreciated for her talent. Unfortunately when you make the cover of your debut cd to include half your face and all your br**sts, you are asking for trouble. Now, she'll never be president. Hmm. She is a good Dj, always spins crowd pleasers, and might have a few catchy tunes but I am not impressed with her own stuff as a whole. It's a shame Kemistry's talent was overshadowed by this...god bless her soul."
2,What is this?,"F With your Head is okay, and Bad Behaviour or whatever too, but for the most part - - - Marx420dapimp or whatever 3 reviews below me says she does all that the Prodigy can and cant do. Hes probably only heard the 3rd album THE FAT OF THE LAND and even in that case she cant do everything they can He also says a must for anyone who thinks their an electronica guru, and that is what this bile is, electronica, not good enough to be called techno, this is electronica, poppy obnoxious boring techno, also he says he hasnt been as impressed as this since Vegas by The Crystal Method, another horrible group, if you want good jungle/drum n bass, buy soemthing by Mu-ziq, Squarepusher, Dillinja, Goldie, or Adam F, groups and people who im sure no one who thinks this is good has ever heard of"
5,dj rap does all the things that prodigy can and can't do.,"not since crystal method's vegas album have i been so excited about an artist in the ""techno"" genre. the beats are smooth and the lyrics hit like A-bombs. a must have for anyone who thinks they're a electronica guru. need my agent to get in touch with her so she can do some songs for the soundtrack of my new movie. please don't classify her as madonna's twisted little sister folks, because she's bigger than that."
2,"Ummmm....sorry, this one isn't very good.","Yeah, i bought this CD because i heard she is one of the better Drum N' Bass DJs....and she's really damn cute. Problem is...this CD isn't very good at all. Trying to go too main stream popish, some of the lyrics are laughable, there isn't a single song on this CD that would make it into one of my sets. I'm sure she's a very good DJ, but someone led her down the wrong road this time."
4,Overall solid,"DJ Rap takes a little bit of techno, and a lot of pop and mixes it into something fairly smooth. Sorry, but if you're looking for something cutting edge that has never been done -- you're looking the wrong direction. I think a lot a people think DJ Rap is trying to be something that she is not. Her music does not belong on the same shelf as Prodigy or Crystal Method, but they are all great music to the right ear. I think DJ Rap has put together a very tight, well orchestrated major-label debut. I look forward to what she has to offer in the future."
3,Very good - unfortunately too real !!!!!,"A very good film. The plot was quite intriguing, and the film makes one wonder how it is possible to control the access of children to the Net."
3,"Every teacher, parent, and high schoolers should see this.","I teach a class on how to use the internet, and I am constantly talking about security issues. This is a reality check for every parent and child who is on the interest. It scares as well as educates."
5,Buy this CD!!!,"I'm usually skeptical of Amazon.com reviewers, who have the annoying tendency of giving every album that is above mediocre five stars. In this case, however, Immortal Technique has earned every one of these five-star reviews. Much like dead prez, Technique combines uncompromisingly revolutionary political messages with amazing skills and complex lyrics. Best of all, he doesn't come off as ""preachy"" or as substituting politics for musical ability (e.g., Michael Franti). My favorite tracks are ""Peruvian Cocaine,"" an innovative posse cut which traces the path that illegal drugs take to reach the streets, and ""The 4th Branch,"" which illustrates the mainstream media's complicity in war. I would also highly recommend Technique's first album, ""Revolutionary, Vol 1"". Unfortunately, Amazon.com doesn't carry it, but it's worth the effort of tracking down."
2,meh,"This album is over rated as hell and is definately not a 5 star album. People only like it because he has ""good message"" in his songs which in reality are just a bunch of conspiracies revlavent to like 5 years ago. His flow is god awful and his lyrics are elementary to say the least. He is clever at times but that is not enough to make this album have anymore than zero replay value."
