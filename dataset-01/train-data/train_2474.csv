3,Typical replacement cartridge,Brother cartridges are cost effective consumables for their laser printers. I have been using them for 15 years after getting away from HP and their pricy printers and consumables.
2,Brother Drum,"Ordered Brother Drum and the drum was defective. Printer indicated ""dust on drum"" and would not function. Would not work in any other printers in the office that use the same type drum. Had to return drum, have not received replacement yet. Unable to use machine. Hope next drum is not defective."
1,Received it opened and unsealed,"I was very disappointed to see that the box was unsealed, the toner (normally sealed) bag was open and the toner cartridge looked used. The installation instructions were missing. It felt like this was a returned product that was passed off. Very, very annoying."
5,Excellent!,"I never use any other brand toner cartridge for my printer before. It works excellent, I will buy it again."
5,Probably should get a new printer,"Printing on my Brother laser costs so little because these replacement cartriges probably last me 3 or 4 thousand pages, at least of the type I print. I think this is the second cartrige I've bought since I got the printer years ago."
4,Good Product and inexpensive,"I order this product because I had to replace my current one. It was easy to install and use. The best part was that they had a shipping lable ready so that I could return the used one instead of throwing it in the trash or trying to find a recycle place. I just put the old back in the box, taped it up, put the label on and dropped it off at the post office. Real nice..."
3,Brother Black Toner,Fair price and good product. Review is only fair because it was delievered in bad shape with box wet and crushed.
5,Can't Beat the Value,I work for a company like all others in the country that look to save dollars but keep the quality of any product we use. I found this product on Amazon for 1/3 the cost of the exact same item we've been purchasing from a major retailer. Never again will be not search first on Amazon.
4,"Very good quality, real brother toner.","Real brother toner in original company box. I would always buy original toner. never generic,I did learn my lesson."
4,Brother Lasr Cartridge,I am pleased with the product performance to date and the directions to install it. The only minor complaint was the delivery was slow.
5,Brother TN350 Black Toner Cartridge,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007KI6OU/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titleThe toner cartridge works exactly like the name brand version that it replaced. No complaints. I have purchased generic toners in the past and they have not performed as well. The copies that they made were mediocre at best.
1,Not What's Pictured,"I can't comment on the quality of the ink cartridge that we received from Shoplet because it is our office policy not to insert Non-Genuine parts into our equipment. The photo and everything described in this listing indicates that they are offering a GENUINE Brother TN-350 cartridge. I should have known something was ""off"" from the extremely low price. I don't understand how Shoplet can use the Brother photo to represent their off-brand product! Must give Shoplet credit for quick response when we complained- they arranged a prepaid FEDEX pickup the very next day and refunded all our money including shipping."
5,"As always, a seamless and great transaction and perfect product","I don't buy my drums / toner cartridges from anywhere else since I've started getting them from Amazon. They're a great price, consistently in perfect condition and the fastest shipping around. I'm a repeat customer for this item and will continue to be."
3,Tape? You don't need any tape...,"I think that I have reached end of life for my MFC 7820N printer after 4+ years of office use. We have it running off a wireless router with three computers prining off of it. It is now jamming up post fuser every now and again. Too bad, so sad...Anyway, the reason for the post is that we have been refilling our toner cartridges since day one and usually get 3-4 refills before it starts gumming up. The key to doing this is resetting the white flag on the left side (""brother"" facing you) of the cartridge. Some older cartridges require you to remove the screw to reset the flag.Also, there is a reset procedure for the drum which will allow you to get 1000s more copies off the drum. I don't remember it off hand but you can find it on the net."
1,Received third-party (not OEM) cartridge on last order,"I've been purchasing these cartridges from Amazon for years and have found them to offer the best combination of cost, convenience and speed. With my Prime membership, it has been great to be able to order and receive a new cartridge in 2 days.I was very surprised and disappointed on my last order to open the box and find a third-party ""equivalent"" toner cartridge. Had this change been disclosed on Amazon's site, I would not have placed this order. And...the price was higher than they used to charge for OEM cartridges! Many people of course buy third-party cartridges - but only if they are lower in price than the OEM. This change really seems like ""bait and switch"" to me and is very contrary to Amazon's generally excellent business practices.The non-OEM product arrived in the Brother box and was sold and shipped by Amazon.com not by a third-party seller."
4,Its Toner...,"Its toner. What do you want to know? Its black and messy...but they do send you postage to mail the expended trash back to them. They do seem to last a long time, for what its worth."
2,Item was not remanufactured by the Original Manufacturer,"Toner smeared all over my paper when printed, do not buy from this place. It was not even remanufactured by Brother but rather just a refill by a third party with the original cartridge. What a scam?"
5,TN 350,"Bought genuine fax machine cartridge. It is very niceto use and very economical than office supplies store.If the price is constitant evetyone should buy fromwww.amazon.com.Thanks,Kishor Shah"
5,Lasts a long time,I'm about to order a new cartridge for my printer and I noticed that the last time that I ordered toner was 3 years ago. I get a decent amount of use out of my Brother Printer. Toner lasts quite a while. and it's much more cost effective to have a laser printer than an ink jet.
3,"It's still running, but doing it poorly","I'll never buy another product of Brother again. After 2 fax machines and now this laser printer, I'm convinced that they don't care much about the quality of their products. What's wrong with my Brother HL-2040 laser printer?1) Every time I turn on the printer, it would send out a big electrical surge (I actually had to upgrade my surge protectors to minimize this damaging surge!).2) After a couple printouts, the paper loading mechanism no longer work correctly; prints from the paper tray would be ""tilted"" and the margins around the text became vastly inconsistent (I have to feed the paper one at a time through the front slot in order to get straight margins).3) There're severl unexpected ""dots"" printed on the papers. No matter how I clean the interior of the printer or adjust the cartridge, they simply won't go away. It's kind of like the dots you get from a poor ink-jet printer."
3,Most bang for the buck,"When shopping for something so utilitarian in its purpose, one neednt have to go through miles of web mazes just buy a toner cartridge. Shop for price, and timely delivery. I got both, as a matter of fact, the price was so much better than the ""other guys"" i was encouraged to spend the extra nickel and have the shipping expedited. Its a toner cartridge, it came securely and neatly packaged, undamaged and arrived when it was supposed to for a great price. 3 stars."
1,"If you want a giant mess on your hands, this is perfect","Decided to replace working generic (but fading) cartridge with an official TN-350 Brother cartridge for my beloved Brother laser printer. There was some toner loose in the cartridge bag, which I took as a bad sign, but I HAD to print out postage for a customer package this morning.Big mistake - after I followed their directions to replace the cartridge and tried to print, nothing happened. I opened up the printer to find that toner had POURED out all over the inside of the printer, the table, the floor, the sheaf of expensive paper inside. It'll cost hours that I don't have to clean it all out, if if even can be cleaned completely. The paper is ruined regardless. My customer is going to be very unhappy about the delay.Manufaturing defects are completely unacceptable for any cartridge, much less an expensive one like this.Lesson learned: Buy generic. At the very least, it can't be any worse, and may be much better."
1,Horrible! Didn't even get 300 pages.,"Super low quality product. Poor print quality.Cartridge was only partially filled (printed less than 300 pages, should print upwards of 2000).Customer service was rude and less than helpful."
5,Brother Toner TN350,"Needed a toner cartridge - nobody cheaper than Amazon for the Manufacturer product. No sales tax, no shipping, quick delivery - no brainer!"
2,Amazon selling knockoff as Brother TN-350,"I decided to spend a little extra money to buy directly from Amazon -- not from one of the stores that sells through Amazon -- to make sure that I was actually buying a REAL Brother toner cartridge. Sadly, Amazon sent me a knockoff refurbished cartridge that didn't even make it to 2000 copies. Don't let Amazon's picture of the Brother TN-350 box fool you, they may send you a knockoff."
4,"Listed as ""New""","When I purchased this toner cartridge, it was listed as ""New"" by the vendor, but I believe it was a used reconditioned toner being it was not in the original Brother TN-350 boxing, rather just rapped in plastic. Still the unit is working properly, and for the price, you can't go wrong..."
1,Refurbished Cartridge sold as new!!!,"This was supposed to be a NEW cartridge, but I actually received a refurbished unit inside of what looked to be an original, brand new packaging. The product arrived in its original ""Brother"" box, in a properly sealed vacuum package, and the box even has a ""genuine Brother"" hologram. However, once I removed the cartridge from the original packaging I immediately realized that it was obviously a refurbished unit. The cartridge itself was all dirty with toner, it had finger prints all over, the screws looked like they had been tampered with, and a new ""warranty seal"" had been placed on top of the original warranty seal. This was definitely a refurbished cartridge, sold in a new packaging and made to look like a new one!!! If you buy it, make sure you check it once you receive it."
4,Satisfied,"HAPPY WITH PRICE, PRODUCT AND DELIVERY. IT BEATS GOING TO OFFICE SUPPLY STORE, SEARCHING ALL OVER THE STORE FOR IT AND FINDING OUT IT IS WAY OVER PRICED."
5,its a toner cartridge,Delivery was prompt and it was well packed. . . when I stick it in the printer I'll know for sure how it works.
2,"If it streaks, you're out of luck","I always buy only the manufacturer's toner to make sure it's high quality, and I always keep a couple in stock. The last one streaked. I called Brother and went through the company's troubleshooting process by phone, and the service tech concluded that there was indeed a problem with the cartridge, but because I had purchased it 3 months ago, they would not replace it. I offered to send them the cartridge so they could make sure it was a brand new toner cartridge. The tech said no. If we all do business only with those companies that use fairness and common sense; we will create a better world."
5,original manufacturer product,"Excellent product, but a lot cheaper than in any office product store! Extra bonus: no tax or shipping charges."
5,Good,Using it for 2 weeks without problem so I don't know how long will last. Bought printer with a starter toner but can't tell the difference between the regular.
5,"ships fast, cheap, just like store bought",The toner cartridge was half the price of the ones at the store and works fine. It was shipped fast and I am very satisified with the product.
3,Cute,My daughter wanted a turkey. That's what she got. It's cute. For a stuffed animal junky such as my seven year old it was enough.
4,Gobbles the Turkey,"This turkey is cute. I use it for passing it and tossing it to kids. It's a good size to throw and catch. The only thing I have to complain is the tail is really big and floppy, so it makes it a little heavy. Overall, I am very satisfied with this turkey."
1,chatty story about being a cop in NY,"I wanted a book about how a cop trains to shoot. This isn't it. Borrow a copy, it is a good quick and fun read. Stories and anecdotes about being a special operations stake out cop in New York City. Now there is value in such tales, to recruit young cops maybe. But i wanted to read about tactics, training, how to learn to use a pistol. What i got was a lot about his bullets, his gunsmithing, his shooting. But nothing i could use. He is certainly an interesting guy, but i wouldnt want to take a concealed weapon class from him based on this book. I'd rather learn how to shoot like him, then to hear about how he shot some really bad guys.Get Suarez's Tactical Pistol set instead."
1,Ludicrous...!!!!!,"Only in America. The notion that some people find this kind of stuff interesting says a lot about them. That it found a publisher speaks volumes about a culture that encourages everyday citizens to pack heat...and ""protect"" themselves. In trying to make his vile case, Crillo indadvertently shows why we have more to fear from the pinhead next store with his or her shiny new Smith & Wesson than we do from all the so-called street scum. I support gun rights but let's be clear: this kind of nonsense will do more to sink the second amendment than any form of controls. No wonder the rest of the world finds the American preoccupation with firearms both idiotic...and inexplicable. Who can explain this? It makes no sense."
5,Jim Cirillo an excellent model for all law enforcement,"Cirillo's book is in the top five books that I have read over the years dealing with deadly force and the proper methods to use. I think his best chapter is ""Selection of the gunfighter"" and the traits needed. My only hope is that Cirillo will write a follow up book detailing more case histories from the stakeout squad. All in all, lots of practical information for the everyday police officer."
3,Good Book That Could Have Been Fantastic,"Jim Cirillo talking about three topics, as described in the title; Guns, Bullets and Gunfights. This is not a ""how to"" book on tactical shootingThe Guns and Bullets sections were filled with interesting technical stuff interspersed with self-promotion. The Gunfights section, on the other hand, is chock full of real world advice and stories with quite a bit of humor thrown in.My favorite exchange;Lieutenant - ""Jim, did you warn them? Did you tell them to drop their weapons and that they were under arrest?""Cirillo - ""Yeah, but I don't think they heard me because of all the shooting.""Hopefully there are other writings of his that may get published in the future. I would guess he had many important and useful things to say, but this book only gives a small sample."
2,WASTE OF MONEY,THIS BOOK DID NOT DETAIL HIS FAMOUS SHOOTOUTS. IT TALKED ABOUT HIM MAKING UP HIS OWN RELOADS AND SHOOTING PEOPLE WITH THEM. TODAY YOU WOULD GET LOCKED UP BY NOT USING FACTORY AMMO.THE PROBLEM IS IN COURT THEY WOULD SAY MR. SO AND SO COULD NOT USE JUST FACTORY AMMO HE HAD TO MAKE UP HIS OWN KILLER BULLETS. NOTE THIS BOOK IS JUST OLD AND OUT OF DATE. I DO RESPECT THE AUTHOR FOR THE GREAT JOB HE HAD DONE. THE POLITICAL SIDE OF HE BOOK IS GOOD BUT NOW ITS EVEN WORSE.
3,Too little. Needs more.,"A series of gun magazine articles that have been put together to make a book. Not as comprehensive as I would have liked, but there is some good stuff nevertheless. Really this book is more like what it would have been like if you were able to sit down over a few beers with an old warhorse like Jim Cirillo and just let him talk.You get a couple war stories, some talk about technical aspects of firearms and ammo, a little bit about gear,maybe a few pointers on shooting, but nothing in depth. Very interesting, but at the same time you're left wanting more. Sadly Mr. Cirillo was killed in a car crash back in 2007 so this slim volume is all we will ever get."
2,Belongs in the Office of Redundancy Office,"I pray that Jim Cirillo was a better cop than he is an author. There are a few good ""nuggets of knowledge"" here and there throughout the book but if the repeated information was left out, the book would be half it's size. I may give his other books a try but spend your money else where rather than on this one."
3,Might be dangerous for the newbies!,"I would consider this book as one that is poorly written. The author seems to be adamantly arrogant which may be dangerous to new shooters and those eager to learn. I say it is dangerous because his arrogance might mislead people to erroneous judgement and analysis of gunfight scenarios, should the reader ever engage. However, the book also provides significant information on ammunition, so just check it out. It never hurts to be knowledgeable."
2,Very little actual content,"Very actual little content, I would not recommend any one actually buying this book. The one or two gunfights described though were interesting."
5,Great Book if you want to learn about Real Estate Brokerage,"I would encourage anyone to read this book if you are interested in learning more about how Commercial Real Estate Brokerage works. Especially if you are currently a broker, this book is for you.However, if you want to learn about development of huge commercial real estate projects, this book might not be what your looking for. It goes in-depth on deals made over the last 40 years in NYC but speaks more on the sales/leasing end and less on the development end.However the man's story is a great American Dream turned true and will no doubt give you a great look into the Commercial Real Estate world."
5,To refreshen my imagination...,This is a grade level resource. My co-teacher bought the other book and I bought the guide. I'm sure we will find fresh ideas.
4,gift,"this was given to a friend as a 'gag' gift. She likes to go sledding with the 'big boys' so, she gets teased about being a 'sno bunny'."
4,How could I say I love a textbook...,"At least this book isn't very big, but it doesn't seem to coincide with my professor's lectures very well, but it seems to be a generally well-made textbook."
1,Don't Buy,"This book is the second of the two book set. You can also purchase the set as a single edition, however that would be a mistake. I've used this text in class and besides being heavily mistake ridden, as others noticed, its extremely unhelpful for Quantum and Thermo beginners. Poor choice."
2,Weak magnet = disappointment. At least it looks good.,"Pros:-Looks goodCons:-Weak magnet. When you try to rotate the disc from clean to dirty, the whole thing spins-Like any stainless steel product, it tends to get smudged with finger printsI would not buy this product again. It does not meet expectations."
2,Does not turn,"The disc and the magnet in the back are fastened together so tightly that it's impossible to turn the disc and not the magnet. Consequently, the magnet can, and does scratch the front of the dishwasher. There are better, and cheaper, alternatives."
3,50/50,"We have a split dishwasher, so I bought two identical magnets. I was surprised to see how hefty and well built they were. I opened the first magnet and it stuck well to my top dishwasher, but when I placed the second magnet it just slid off onto the floor.How could this be! Was my lower dishwasher not magnetic?! Nope... I swapped them and the first magnet still stuck perfectly where the other had failed. So I ventured around my house trying the second magnet on all the surface I knew were magnetic, and it just slips off.I am going to return the bad one to amazon and order a new one, so we'll see if that one works."
3,Looks nice... Poor magnet,This is a well built item BUT... The magnet is made from a cheap rubber magnet and is weak. My washer has a plastic face over the metal on the door (about 1/8 of an inch thick). A regular magnet works fine but the rubberized magnet is so weak it will not even attempt to attach.Now for the good... a little piece of double sided mounting tape applied to it and it makes a nice looking dial on my new washer.
2,Diswasher Magnet,"This is a great idea. It was just what I needed considering, I had an argument with my husband about putting dirty dishes in the dishwasher on top of the clean dishes. Unfortunately, the magnet does not stick at all. The weight and look of it is good, it fits the decor of the stainless dishwasher, but if it's supposed to be a magnet then it should stick."
2,"Keeps falling off, needs a better magnet!",I like the design of this dishwasher magnet much better than the typical plastic ones. The main drawback is that the magnet will not stay stuck. It has a very cheap magnet attached (think the ones that are attached to the flimsy trinkets you'd find at a gift store).
3,Finally...,"...got around to buying one of this. We're not too lazy to do the dishes, but we are too lazy to check the status of those dishes.So, it spins well and does the job perfectly. Only complaints are that the design isn't my cup of tea and there's not 'stop' to keep it from spinning back."
4,Attractive and gets the job done,"I was somewhat hesitant to order this based on the other reviews about it not being a very strong ""magnet"". I took a chance and am overall very pleased with this order. It sticks well to my dishwasher so I suspect that some people's DWs are made with different materials on the face. It is actually better looking in person than the picture for this listing. My only complaint is that it doesn't rotate a full 180 degrees around, just shy of that. So if I rotate it all the way to Dirty and then stick it on my dishwasher, I can rotate it around to Clean, but Clean isn't quite at the top of the circle. A minor irritation, but something that I can't help but notice..."
4,Hard to read,"The magnet is strong. I love the way it turns from 'Clean' to 'Dirty' so easily. But it's a bit hard to see with the black on brushed steel, especially against my beige dishwasher."
4,Dishwasher magnet,I have had many products to alert my family if the dishes were clean or dirty. This is by far the best. The best part is the ease of use.Just a twist of the magnet to change from dirty to clean....clean to dirty.
4,Great shower gift!,"I've been looking in the kitchen supply stores for this for months! Could not find it anywhere ~ but online. This one is a great choice because it is functional and great looking with any decor. A few other styles were either too ""cutesy"" or bulky - I was concerned that too bulky would mean easily falling off and breaking. This is sleek and has a solid magetic backing. The future bride absolutely loved it as one of her wishing well gifts AND had not received others! I've had a similiar one for years now and such a simple idea has made a big difference in our house. Its functionality in avoiding many a fight over putting dirty dishes into a clean load makes this a savvy purchase! Reasonable price for the quality as I'm confident it will last. I would recommend this purchase and this seller."
1,Material fit for a different century - or perhaps millenium,"I found this book to be a racist collection of fanatic opinions which, if addressed toward visible minorities, would be cause for outcry. What I had hoped to be an objective, informative text is simply offensive garble about good and evil. References to the devil or that intermarriage marriage is more damaging to Jews than Hitler are seriously disturbing. If two people in love choose to abandon their future together on the basis of such philosophies then I pity the role of religion in their lives.The physical presentation is as poor as the content. Spiral bound books can also mean spiral bound, one sided BW photocopies of computer printed scripts - where some pages are so poorly photocopied that they are crooked, grey and at times hard to read.I'm promtly returning this material because I cannot morally bear to think that someone would receive one cent of royalties for such efforts."
5,Great Towels,"These 'Envision' paper towels are a terrific buy. They claim to be environmentally friendly - which, for my company - helps us to feel a bit better about using so many of them. In addition, they always arrive quickly and without hassle."
2,Ok......for the price.,These paper towels are definetly at the low end of the budget for paper towels. Are they worth the low price I paid for them....yes. I knew it was a risk purchasing them considering how low they were priced. Each individually wrapped package had several paper towels hanging out of it and when you open them to put them in the dispenser you end up having to remove the first 4-6 paper towels to get to the ones that actually pull down nicely. Again given the price this is to be expected. The paper towels themselves are fair to poor in absorbancy thus my lower rating. You end up using twice as many to dry your hands as you would if you had purchased a higher quality paper towel. This is a case of you get what you pay for. If you are looking for budget paper towels and don't mind the above you will like these.
5,Best Zorro Ever,"I'm 57 yrs old and have been a Zorro fan/atic since age 4, and a Zorro video collector for years. In my opinion, this series is absolutely the BEST incarnation of Zorro ever made, and I have them ALL (with a couple of hard-to-find old movie exceptions. Do NOT try to ""compare"" it to the Disney series. They're totally different styles. Both are great. The Disney series is pure WALT Disney style family fun. This series has more ""meat"" to it, much better character development, less comedy, but still quite a few comedic moments. Very family friendly but also excellent for adults."
3,Rather Inconsistent Effort,"While there are some great melodies on here, there are some tracks that don't do anything for me in that the vocals are discordant. I'd say about 50% of the CD is worth having, the rest is disposable.Marlene is by far the standout track and is like the BJH of the past."
3,OK--but limited,"Practical suggestions for the school music teacher. The limited information about the saxophone is, I think, the weakest aspect of the text."
2,Kinda outdated,Not real user friendly. I would probably not have bought it if I had known. Looks like the pages were done on a cheap copy machine. Not happy with the product really.
2,You must know your instrunment parts,"Not being a music teacher, I don't really know the names of each instrument parts. Reading through this book I noticed that one must know the technical names of all the musical instrument parts.More illustrations would have been very useful, whether they are pictures or drawings.Conclusion: if you can find online instrument part schematics, it would greatly help."
5,Vintage Guitar magazine review:,"Nuevo tanguero Astor Piazzolla's legacy continues to thrive even now, years after his death. Nonesuch has re-released Tango: Zero Hour, which is without doubt Piazzolla's finest moment. If you have not heard Piazzolla, this is the place to start. His bandoneon playing was never better; his New Tango Quintet was at its peak; and this collection of old and new songs is like a greatest hits album with impeccable sound and dynamic arrangements. Hats off to original producer Kip Hanrahan for masterminding the original release and to Nonesuch for reviving it."
5,Best Piazzolla,"This CD is 5 stars from the 1st music to the end. The Concierto para quinteto is my favourite, with incredible piano and guitar playing. Traditional tango, although I like it, sounds like child music in front of this tour-de-force. Buy this CD, you can't be wrong"
5,amazing: recommended to all jazz fans,"I'm new to Piazolla - this is only my 2nd CD. The first wasPiazzolla: Five Tango Sensationsand though it is very good if you're only getting one I'd recommend starting with this one. Of the two, Piazolla's originality is more in evidence on this one. (Also, if you already have the Kronos, you might tryTango Sensations: Alban Berg Quartet, which I've seen in the store but haven't heard yet.)In musical sensibility, Piazolla's tango has a lot in common with jazz and classical music. His music is about innovation, the unexpected; the more you listen to it the more surprises and nuances it reveals.My third Piazolla disk will be Yo-Yo Ma'sSoul of the Tango: The Music of Astor Piazzolla. If you're richer than I am you might get all of these at once; if you're as poor as I then start with Tango: Zero Hour."
4,A Great Read About An Enigmatic Icon,"I am utterly fascinated by Houdini, and this book takes great pains to tell the story of his mysterious life. The notions that Houdini was a spy and could have been murdered were complete shocks to me. The book covers these and other facets of Houdini--including his foibles and shortcomings. Well worth your time!"
5,"Enjoyable, fascinating and convincing",This book was thoroughly enjoyable to read. I found the authors' premise that Houdini was a spy facinating and convincing. It would be a wonderful gift for the holidays. Buy this book!
2,No documentation just innuendo!,"This was a very entertaining book, but without documentation or footnotes it was hard to tell if it was fact or fiction. Assumptions were made by the authors many times, but there was no way to tell if it was accurate as there was no proof of any kind whatsoever just lots of innuendo . Where is the proof?? And I don't like the use of quotes as if they were right there taking down dialogue word for word when you know that they weren't. It was a really annoying read. Now, I did enjoy seeing all the new Houdini photographs, but then again they were printed on the same cheap pulp paper as the rest of the book!"
3,Confusing,"The research that went into this book is obviosuly impressive. However, its as if this was written by first time authors and was not edited by anyone. The writing is labored and often confusing. I found myself having to read paragraphs two and three times to figure out what the authors were talikng about. Furthermore, the subject mattter is all over the place. They skip ahead and back chronologically, and only intermitently mention their presumptions on Houdini's ""spying."" From an historic perspective, the book is interesting. However, from a reading perspective, the book is practically unreadable."
3,Wide-ranging epic suffers from scope creep,"Scope creep is when your perspective keeps creeping out further and further. The research is vast and the writing style is easy to digest, yet the book has no central nexus. It covers too many events and avenues of Houdini's life. Plus, we were all sold on this book because of the spy angle; the support is weak at best and leaves you remembering your college philosophy class: ""corraltion does not mean causation."" Lots of A + B might equal C, maybe, kind of logic is used.The book isn't a bad read, but towards the end, I found myself skipping entire chapters out of boredom and frustration with the lack of focus. Shave two hundred pages out of the text and bring in the focus to one or two major avenues of Houdini, and I'd have loved it."
3,Thorough - stylistically weak,"I'm in the middle of this book - and the industry with which these two fellers have approached their target (Mr Houdini and his life) is formidable. There prose skills are less so. I don't know whether there was a conscious decision during the authoring process to limit the range of their vocabulary (don't wanna challenge a mainstream audience with rare (and perhaps more precise) words), but I do have a sense of reading a long, long newspaper article, aimed for a grade 6, maybe 7 audience. The tale is indeed lively despite the pedestrian phrasing and the spy hypothesis is good fun. I've always found the figure Harry Houdini fascinating since reading a for-children biography back in elementary school, so I 'just deal with' the less-than-scintillating style of these two, palpably enthusiastic and committed followers of Mr Houdini."
5,Quite a Man!,As an adult I have become more interested and fascinated with magicians and illusions. This biography of Houdini is fantastic! The book presents Houdini not only as one of the greatest illusionists but you see him as a person and what really motivated him. There are lots of great pictures and much insight as to who Houdini really was.
4,The Handcuff King,"Harry Houdini was quite an extraordinary man. He could escape from almost any type of restraint, pick cell door locks with ease, and toward the end of his life, battle to expose phony mediums. This book tells it all, but in a rather odd way. Often there are disconnects between sections of the book, and it doesn't flow chronologically, which can get somewhat confusing. Also, many times the authors discuss something, but don't pin it down in time, which definitely is confusing. One of the main aims of the book, according to the authors, was to reveal that Houdini worked as a ""secret agent"" for various governments. While they cobble together suppositions and snippets of writings, to my mind they don't get anywhere near proving their case. Read the book for the story of an amazing man, and let it go at that!"
4,Can't get enough Houdini,"Very well written and as always with H. H., absolutely facinating. If he were working today people would be saying it's camer tricks but this guy worked is behind off for even the most simple trick. He was a wonder."
5,Big Bang Theory-Season 5,I got the package very quickly after ordering. I enjoyed watching all my favorite episodes again without commercial interruption! Quality is great!
5,"Sheldon, Leonard, Raj and Howard Rule!",I absolutely LOVE this series!! I am hoping that it is one of those shows that never ends! We look forward to watching the new episodes as they come out!
5,Cant go wrong with Big Bang Theory,Arrived in good shape. Can watch this show over and over again :) Great show!!!! Husband love it too & our friends are HOOKED now :)
5,great service,great product great service when I ran into issues with a scratched disk it was replaced immediately with no hassle I'm a very happy customer
5,Purchased Big Bang season 5,This Series is AWESOME! They were packaged appropriately everything brand new and was received sooner than I even expected. Loved it.
4,Great show,"TBBT is a great show and Season 5 was awesome just like the previous seasons. I would have rated it 5 stars if it the Ultroviolet included itunes digital download like so many titles have done in the last year. I have a flixster account and have the app on my iPad 3, but I'd much rather just have it on my Apple TV as an itunes digital download. I know i can use AirPlay Mirroring on my iPad or MacBook Pro, but that's such a pain and usually creates a lag issue. Streaming directly on the Apple TV is the preferred method, so I wish they would continue giving itunes codes along with the awful Flixster codes."
5,Gotta have this!,This moves the characters' personal stories further along. If you have the other four this is a must. I can hardly wait for the sixth season to be out.
1,People like this?,"Saying ""Mario"" or ""Zelda"" in the punchline of a poorly written jest filled with several scientific terms that contain more then three syllables which are never used in their intended audiences typical environment, barley heard of a audience about to claw out their eyes from laughter is not funny or orginal.And yes I've been told I resemble Sheldon at my university, work and home.*laugh track*"
5,Love it,I love it so much I cried. still crying now. It was so funny I almost died from hard laughing
5,Excellent show!,The 5th season of Big Bang Theory is excellent. I am relatively new to the show and am so glad I began watching reruns on TBS. I purchased all the seasons. The show never fails to make me laugh out loud. I highly recommend all BBT seasons.
3,just my opioion,"I recently pick up Season 5 at Best buy. I just finish watch the whole season 5, and I was kinda disappointed.I feel it isn't about bunch of nerds living next door to a hot chick anymore.I feel the writers are moving away from the NERD concept and giving each one a relationship or trying to, stripping away the NERD title.If they continue on this course it might be another boring sitcom."
2,"Big Bang, fifth season","I own the DVD sets for all five seasons. This series continues to be somewhat entertaining but the humor continues to more and more for a Junior High level audience. As an ""older"" viewer, I emjoy smart television and movies along with those containing a generous amount of slapstick comedy. And as a Computer and A/V tech, I can relate to people just like the characters in the show; but I do not, never have and never will find bathroom humor amusing in any form. Each and every show has at least one and usually more than one reference to bodily functions that I find unfunny and tedious.Wake up Hollywood, teenagers don't have money, we do. I would give this season two out of five stars."
5,just what I expected,just like all the other episodes I own it follows the same excellnt acting by these stars. give it an a+ rating
5,Awesome Big Bang Theory,"This Big Bang episode shows even when the writers are exploring new ground with the caracters that its still comic genius. The best part of the show is Sheldon drunk, but that is just to peak your interest."
5,Big Bang: Weekend Vortex,Great Feed and Quality Video. Amazon has done a great job with their streaming services and watching this episode is more proof of their great work. Thanks Amazon!!!
5,BANG!,"This is a great show.. funny, smart, nerdy, and addicting! I've bought every season so far from Amazon.com and it always ships fast and arrives in perfect condition!I have only one recommendation though...Buy it!"
5,Hysterical,"This show is hysterical. Highly recommend it to all. If you've started from the beginning, you already know how funny the show is. If you haven't watched from the beginning. I recommend starting with Season 1, but it would still be funny starting with 5."
5,great service,I give this a five star review because it was shipped quickly and because it is completely new as described. Great reliability.
3,Great Product but delivered damaged,"I awaited this product with much anticipation for almost a year. Whn it arrived the DVD case was damaged (Bent). The DVD's themselves don't appear to be damaged. However, I do feel that the damage occured because the product was not packaged properly. If the CD's are fine it won't be a big deal, but when you are waiting so long for a brand new product it is disappointing to receive something damaged because of improper packaging."
3,Seems like a different writer,"I love TBBT, but this episode is an anomaly. It seems like someone else wrote it other than the regular writers -- Sheldon's character especially seems off-kilter. I know that was part of the point of the episode, but when Sheldon does out-of-character things, it usually is funnier (i.e. his relationship with Amy). This episode just seemed stilted. Still can't wait for the wedding episode, though. Howard and Bernadette are hilarious together."
5,The Big Bang Theory,One of my favorite shows and if not the best show out there at this point. It has everything and it'll have you laughing off your chair. Plus you can learn a thing or two.Have been watching the show since season three and I'm loving it. I'd recommend this show to anyone who enjoys a comedy.Can't wait till season 5 is available. :)
4,Always Funny,Love every season and this is one of the best...... I can not get enough and can't wait to add season six.
5,My Favorite Show,"My wife and I love this show, and it gets better with every season. We love the jokes, sci-fi references and guest stars. I don't laugh out loud at much, but Big Bang Theory gets me every time."
5,Love this show!,This is one of the funniest shows ever! I absolutely love the show and the characters! Such a good one to watch over and over again.
5,Awesome series,Really enjoyed this collection of episodes. The Big Bang Theory never fails to impress me. I believe this is the series where Raj falls in love with Siri as well.
5,Awesome Season,I was hooked from the first time I watched this serie. I love all the cast members and Ill say that Peggy is very hot.
5,I hate broadcast TV in general but I love The Big Bang Theory,"I don't watch much TV, but I love The Big Bang Theory. It's funny in a nerdy way. The characters are so well played, there are times I forget Sheldon Cooper is not a real person! The writing in this show is amazing - I am constantly wondering ""how do they come up with this stuff"" as I'm laughing hysterically."
5,Best series,Best comedy series to come out in the last several years. Makes it cool to be nerdy. Nerds you can rejoice.
3,"Overpriced for 1 episode, but lots of laughs","Amazon needs to do better on the pricing for single episodes. I purchased this by accident, as I would never pay 2.00 for 20 mins of entertainment. But, I was indeed entertained."
5,Great DVD's!!,This is a great collection of dvds and I chose this rating because of the fact that I love the show and love the dvds. I would recommend it to all!!
5,One of the best shows I watch,"I don't care if ""real"" geeks make fun of me for watching BBT, it's funny and entertaining and I look forward to watching it and getting some of the references. We'd previously watched most of the seasons on Netflix (having missed out on it when it first aired) and then just before season 6 started were wanting to get caught up on season 5. I personally bought the digital editions and then bought the DVDs as a Christmas gift for relatives.So if you were at the end of the fourth season, waiting to find out what happened after Penny spent the night with Raj, you will be amply entertained."
5,Great gift!,This complete fifth season was a great price and arrived on time! My husband is in the military and could always use a laugh. he loved it!
5,Great TV show,"I love the BBT series. I've already bought the first four seasons as a set. I wish the covers matched more, but that's not a reflection of how great this series is."
5,Big bang theory season four!,I am really happy to have this show in my collection! Of course cuz I'm not a genius I don't know most of the definition of most of what's in the script but they make it awesomely funny! Wish I could get season five now but it's still in production!
3,ok,"This was a good season with the addition of the rest of the girls to the regular cast., especially the characther of Amy (malyk). But i don't think is a good idea story wise the weeding of Howard and Bernadette. They starting to run out of ideas."
4,Great Episode,It seems like these guys can't miss! I love the roommate agreement. Just a classic set up device for the comedy of futility.
5,Bazinga!,"I love any show that portrays intelligence as one of the highest qualities of the human condition. The cast is spot on brilliant. The stereotypically awkward social interactions with ""normal"" people provide endless fodder for situational humor while the strong character development endears you to their plight. Highly recommended."
4,"Funny, but predictable","This episode is great--though not the best. I'd have to say that season five is a bit of slump, but this episode is fun, as usual. I would say the only weakness in this episode is that it is very predictable. Still, a great way to spend 20 minutes."
5,Why buy? Gread Extras!,"Found this show during summer reruns in 2012 and fell in love. Smart, funny and quirky- my wheelhouse. I bought the entire series just to ""catch-up"". I didn't realize the DVDs would contain so many extra features. The outtakes alone are worth the price. They also have great cast interviews, behind the scenes featurettes and of course commentary."
5,my favorite tv show,absolutely love this show and having the complete series is awesome to watch to catch up when im behind a season.
5,Who doesn't like The Big Bang Theory?,My husband absolutely loves this show - so I have been buying him every single season as they come out. It's hilarious...plus it's really fun to watch the characters evolve from season to season.
5,Bam!,"What can I say . . . If you love The Big Bang Theory, you will love this collection! A must have!"
2,never got this Item,"HelloI never got this item. did you send it.I am overseas, but it should have gotten here by now"
1,Disappointed,"I regret buying the book. It's called ""A Speaking text for Advanced and Intermediate Students"", but on taking a look inside I realised that there was little to speak about. If I had had a chance to look through the book before ordering it I'd never have bought a copy. The texts are either boring or too complicated. More suitable for native speakers of English studying rhetoric."
5,Must Read for the Novice,"I have not yet begun blackpowder hunting but found this book to be invaluable. This book is a wonderful, comprehensive introduction to the sport without becoming overwhelming. It covers the all aspects of the firearms from shooting to maintenance but also covers hunting. 8 chapters are devoted to individual big game species, giving valuable information about these animals and how to hunt them with a muzzleloader. Finally the book contains a valuable collection of resources from taxidermists to outfitters. This is a valuable introduction for the newcomer to blackpowder hunting and I highly recommend it. The author has covered all the bases and you can't go wrong. If you think you might like to pick up a muzzleloader the next time you go hunting, take a look at this title."
2,The Nonpartisan Council of Foreign Relations?,"The book contains useful information. But it leaves out some major chapters that should have been included. Some of the author's assumptions are open to question.For example, on page 243, the author quotes a reference from the ""nonpartisan Council of Foreign Relations.""The CFR roster includes many members of the elite who designed the strategy and tactics for the ""hostile takeover"" deplored by author Sirota. How can the he possibly characterize this organization as ""nonpartisan?""Also, the author makes no mention of 9/11, the ""war on terror,"" the missing ""weapons of mass destruction,"" the attack on our civil liberites, election fraud, and the incredible veil of secrecy that keeps truth from the average citizen."
1,Take it to Your Seat Literacy Centers,This book was a real disappointment!! I think the write-up/description is a little misleading. It is also not grade appropriate as stated.
1,Annoyed,"I wish I had read the review before buying this item, as the playlist shown by Amazon bears no resemblance to the real list of tracks.In Particular the one track I was desperate to get was ""I Will"" by Ruby Winters, was not on the actual CD, I am really disappointed.The only positive was that the CD was delivered within 1 week, and was in good condition."
5,The Real Deal,An American product that is what it says it is. Best hose on the market. I bought it before I renovated my house. I've now put on the second floor and completed the whole house and this hose is still like new. It's been stepped on and dragged around everywhere.
3,Ok air hose,"The hose is actually good, but I was expecting a higher PSI rating. It is only 200 PSI and it doesn't say that anywhere. I do like the flexibility of the hose and it is light and easy to work with."
5,A Roamin' Holiday,"This CD has some of the best well-done Christmas selections I have ever heard, especially ""A Song for Christmas"". The men's voices are awesome!"
2,Way outdated,"With everyone moving to .Net now the code in this book, which is very ""rushed"" and unclean, is woefully outdated. It's very likely that if you do build this MUD you'll end up getting hacked and having all your work be for nothing."
5,Excellent Book!,"I can't believe anyone actually wrote a book about MUD's. When I wanted to learn how to make my own, I had no idea where to start, and looking at the code from all the existing MUD's just confused the hell out of me. So when I saw this book I ran out and grabbed it immediately, and I am just amazed at how much information is packed into it. This book is great if only for the networking information; the whole first 5 chapters of this book could be an entire book on its own, but in addition to all of that there are even two full MUD's!The book even teaches you how to use Python--another bonus! I look forward to making my own MUD with this book!By the way, one of the reviews here made a big deal about the circular dependency issues covered in the book, and I must say that I disagree with that review completely, the book handles them well. I see absolutely no problem with using macros if they are used with caution, which they are.Overall: Great book, worth every penny."
2,"Good Theory, Vague and Outdated Code","This book is a good start for those who want to work on the guts of their own mud. The target audience seems to be accomplished C++ programmers. The author assumes a great deal of expertise on the part of the reader; I for one was left in the dark on many topics.The code examples on the companion CD are not fully explained in the book, and I found several code snippets in the source files that had no mention at all in the relevant chapters. The code examples also will not compile on newer versions of GCC without a great deal of work.This book is a good intro to network programming, and does a good job of outlining what is needed to design and code a MUD from scratch, but I would stay away if you are not already an accomplished programmer."
3,"Wood fell off, but buck is replacing",This product was a gift for an avid hunter who takes care of his stuff. The wood part fell off. Good thing is that buck stands behind their products and is sending him a new one. I wouldn't expect anything else.
5,Eric = AMAZING,"Stumbled upon his music through myspace... he has a wonderful voice, and the tunes are very catchy and addictive. I definitely recommend this cd and his latest, Cross Over, which can be purchased at his myspace page!"
1,An inacurate guide,"Simply put, this book is a horrible excuse for a game guide. After reading the original Homeworld guide, one would expect better for a game much tougher than the original. The guide contains many exeprts straight from the game manual. The game guide does not give specific directions for the single player campaign (the main reason one buys a game guide), only broad strategies that any decent gamer could have come up with on their own. Some major game events listed in the guide do not even happen in the game! I am not sure if that is due to bugs or misleading writing but is obvious that the writers played very little (if any) of the game themselves and only wrote what they were told to by the project management. To be blunt, the guide is impersonal and flat out inacurate in its strategies for Homeworld 2. Very dissapointing."
3,Mediocre publication,"While Tom Till is a wonderful photographer - I stop by his shop every time I'm in Moab - it is unfortunate that he prefers to use a local publisher for his books. Many images in the books are printed with garish colors and poor focus. I've seen the original photos, and this mediocre publication does not do them justice."
5,This is a beautiful book,"Prose that is poetry. A must for any fan of John Berger. And for readers that don't know his work it should be a revelation. An extraordinary, moving, and passionately empathetic book."
1,Great hardcopy but probably the worst CD textbook,"This is from a great hardcopy textbook but it is probably the worst CD textbook I have ever seen in terms of being difficult to use. Only runs under Netscape and self-configures only with older versions of netscape. Will not really run under mac OSX unless you spend hours setting up a ""pseudonetwork"" on your computer desktop. They should not be selling this outdated ""dinosaur"" CD from 2001. Buy it if you want to waste a lot of your time and end up with a very very klutzy interface. Publisher Saunders should rerelease with a modern interface, or transfer it to different CD publisher. Project leader at W.B. Saunders for this CD should be FIRED!!! or at least seriously demoted or made to listen to Lawrence Welk."
2,RITA COOLIDGE ON STAGE AT WOLRD CAFE,"AS THE LOVELY RITA'S BIGGEST FAN. SINCE THE EARLY SEVENTIES,I'VE SEEN HER IN CONCERT MANY,MANY TIMES. THIS VIDEO WAS A DISSAPOINTMENT. ON ""SUPERSTAR"",RITA SEEMS TIRED & BURNED OUT (FROM SINGING THIS SONG?). ""BORN UNDER BAD SIGN"",""FEVER"",""WE'RE ALL ALONE"",ALMOST THROUGH THE END,SHE RUSHES THROUGH THESE SONGS SOUNDING NOTHING LIKE THE ORIGINALS. RITA SINGS ALL ""HER FAVORITES"". SHE FORGOT TO SING HER ""FANS FAVORITES""."
2,What a disappointment,"What a disappointment! Small, overpriced, dated book. The breathless recommendations for the wonderful things you can learn and apply (OODA loops!, remarkable insights! etc.) perhaps had me expecting too much. Even considering that, it was still a light and largely useless read. I give 2 stars only because someone who has no understanding of Sun Tzu or John Boyd might be encouraged to go ELSEWHERE to learn something about their ideas."
3,Why is this book $159.99?,Really? I would like to purchase this book either in the kindle format or as a hardcopy book...Why is it $159.99?
3,Super soft,"I gave my niece this cat for xmas, and that night she slept with it and the top seam along it's back started to open, and filling came out. I told her he needed to go to the vet, and have it sewn shut. It's too much effort to mail it back for a new one, and she won't give it up anyhow. She loves the cat, just not the highest quality since the seam busted that night."
5,Great Samples & Instructions,"Not just for scrapbookers, this is for anyone who loves to play with photos. The instructions clearly explain the angles and mirroring to create the results you want, and the samples provide a wide array of ideas to get you going. Cool stuff!"
5,A Must Have For Great Scrapbook Pages!,"This book has clear instructions, and great step by step photos for creating fabulous layouts that will stand out in any book!!"
5,Not for K10D,I just want everyone to know...because I got this by mistake...This is NOT for the K10D. It is a great product and work Great on my istDL.But it will not work on the K10D.
4,Gangsters got Beat,"I was told this artist was new, but was worth listening to. Well they were right, its not for everyone, its pretty explicit. The lyrics on some are pretty deep and its got some great beats. Not bad for gangster rap. I like it. =)"
4,Another Computer Language Conversion Book,"As the Personal Computer became wide spread, different programming languages came out of almost every part of the country. BASIC, PASCAL, FORTRAN, COBOL, APL, and more. Most saying they were better than the others, 1 way or another. They all had simular commands and their own special type of commands. They all had their place in what ever certain types of computations you needed to do. And many book were written on how to convert 1 language to another. Here's another. Good if you know BASIC and are learning PASCAL."
2,Visual Land MP4/MP3 only works when it feels like it!!!!!,"I purchased a visual land vl 546 2 months ago and it keeps turning itself on and off. The sound is great if you can keep it playing. Also they carry a one year warranty, but you have to pay $19.00 plus shipping for them to repair it. I think thats a rip-off. Also its hard to get in contact with their customer support. There's no phone number only an email address. I think their MP3 players are cheaply made."
3,"A cute plushy, but the size of the average cellphone.","Its really cute and just what you'd expect. But I couldn't believe how small it was. I don't think its worth $9, but I dont care about returning it. Its adorable and very portable (the good thing about being small). I'm not a TY Beanie Babies collector at all but this was a good buy for a gift for a special someone (like a niece or child)."
5,The book I was waiting for,"I've been looking for a book like this for a long time. It wasn't until a friend recommended it to others on Facebook that I became aware of it. Although my son hasn't been diagnosed with autism, he is really benefitting from the examples in this book, and it's also faciliated some great family discussions. I think every child, of every ability, can benefit from this book. Children with difficulty reading social skills will find this an enjoyable (rather than painfully boring) way to learn and understand some of the common but confusing rules of social convention."
3,A great book for the future--just not for my 4 year old,"I bought this book hoping to help my 4 year old with some social skills for his inclusion in regular preschool. However, I think that at this time, he is a little young to really benefit from this book. I have used it with some success in standing in line and giving kids some personal space. It has also helped him in circle time. However, the bulk of this book will be better when he is older. I believe that if an autistic child can read and look at the pictures, a great deal of the topics will be helpful to them."
5,I Cannot Say Enough Good Things About This Book,"I looked at this book a few times and--not recognizing its worth--passed it by. When another parent of a child with AS recommended it, saying it was very helpful with her daughter, I immediately bought a copy. This was easily the best $[...] I ever spent. To hear my 9 year old son (who has Asperger's Syndrome)say things like, ""would you like to hear more about this now, or would you like to talk about something else,"" or, after losing a game, say ""good game"" instead of going into an emotional meltdown is a great joy. He loves the pictures and the practical, real-world scenarios and he learns things from this book that he can immediately implement to help him with day-to-day life. Highly recommended."
5,One of the best social skills books for children w/ autism that I've found so far,I teach an autistic support class (ages 7-9) and was looking for a simplistic book to work on teaching social skills. I used the book in class the other day and the children were actually somewhat interested in looking through it with me-they really appreciate having things broken down for them. We roleplayed the steps for what to do if someone teases you & will continue to use the book in the classroom. I do agree that the pictures inside the book aren't nearly as engaging as the front cover but I am very happy with my purchase.
5,EVERY parent should have this book!,"This book is a godsend to any parent and child dealing with Aspergers, add, adhd ... trust me - but to be perfectly honest, every parent should read it with their kids especially children that learn better visually ... but who doesn't learn better visually using real life photos of classroom and social behavior? This is a must have for EVERY child that is entering preschool and/or kindergarten. Every library needs this book ... tell yours!I read alot of books and have never felt a need to post a review until now. Teaching our children how to fit in socially in the world, whether they have *disabilities* or not, is our job. This is the tool every parent needs to encourage socially acceptable behavior prior to bad behavior being the issue at hand! We can tell children until we are blue in the face, but this shows them in a way they can understand ... real life examples they face or will face as the enter school. Must have."
5,"Terrific, Easy to Use Book","I'm reading this book to my five-year old, whose social skills can use some improvement. It's well-organized and covers the basics. Acting out the lessons to mirror the pictures reinforces the message."
1,no age proper,we got this for my 2 and 1/2 years old with learning disability. hw did not even want to even look at it and pictures were just so hard to understand even for my as an adult without the title.
3,"Size says medium, but really small","I didn't read the reviews or description very carefully. Overall the case is small and compact, but only small sized pills can fit each compartment. Each compartment can fit only 1 capsule-sized pill and maybe 1 smaller one. If you take 2 capsule-sized pills, look for something else. The closure system does seem secure. I have one of the longer boxes, but I found it is not conducive to travel. Each compartment fits all of the pills I take on a daily basis, but it doesn't have a very secure lid. This case seems like it would be perfect for smaller sized pills and it does seem secure, but it doesn't meet my needs. I'm going to try the large size in the round case."
4,A most memorable story!,"It's easy to see that the US government and the established energy industries would not take kindly to private development of inxpensive alternative fuel, but it had not occurred to me that the medical establishment would not welcome a cure for cancer! I loved the convoluted plot combined with an exciting, suspense-filled ride."
4,For Tom Clancy fans interested in space,"The elements of a fine first novel by Mr. Mavis: 1) A space shuttle hit by an asteriod, 2)the ""hero"" - an outsider who has a risky, daring solution when NASA runs out of options - is a former lover of one scientists on the shuttle, and 3) the knowledge that one of experiments on the shuttle could save the hero's mother from her cancer.There were almost too many twists and turn, too much suspense for one book to hold. In the end, however, a satisfying resolution with just the hint of what may come if Mavis decides to write a sequel. All of the twists have the feel of reality, showing how much the author has researched the subject and thought through his ""disaster"" scenerio.Suspense with extra caffine added."
2,Not the same as the picture,This item was NOT metal on the outside. It was plastic with the zap cap logo on it. Kinda disappointing.
4,Zap Cap,"Well, it works pretty well, but you have to get it right on the top of the bottle. I think I've only been able to get it off on the first try once. My husband can do it every time, so it depends on the person. It is very cool, but can be tricky sometimes."
2,Okay for the uniqueness,"Good for the first couple of weeks, but not built to last. Takes several tries as it gets older."
1,Maui Jim Kahuna Sunglasses,"I've had these sunglasses for several months and overall they're acceptable. There is some type of film or coating on the inside of the lenses which is wearing off one lens but the repair is too expensive to make it worth taking care of. I don't know if the film has anything to do with the ""High contrast lens"" designation or not. If the lens coating weren't wearing off I'd give the glasses five stars.The glasses are comfortable and light weight and I'm reasonably happy with them. When they need replacing I'll look at other brands, though. They're too expensive to fail so quickly."
1,not as pictured,"not as pictured, look on line for the item # to see what you get.not as pictured, look on line for the item # to see what you get."
4,The Island of Adventure adventure,"Ordering from Amazon.com is quick and easy. This book my wife remembered from her childhood. All she could recall was a place called Craggytop. I started a search with that....and viola, I found the book. I ordered it with ease, and received it in very good condition a lot quicker that I expected. I will use Amazon again and agian."
3,Not necessarily for beginners...,"Small Print and some tough chords make this book a little too difficult for beginner guitarists. However, there are a few songs a beginner should be able to master if he/she knows the melody. Would be better for a more advanced guitarist. Suggestion: Larger Print on 8.5"" x 11.0"" pages."
4,Rock and Roll Made Easy,"This is just a basic book of melody line, lyrics and chords, but it's a great way to start playing all your favorite songs. It's inexpensive, and easily portable to jam sessions with your friends!"
4,Wow,"Most of the music in the book is extremely accurate.The only thing that I have a problem with is the treble clef part. All of the songs have the melody written in on the treble clef, and it leaves out parts of the song that really help give it that Fiona Apple feel.But other than that, Fiona Apple is an amazing songwriter and this book captures that well."
3,Not terrible,"I love Fiona's distinctive piano playing, and I was really hoping this songbook would have the notes she actually plays. Instead you end up with a bunch of simplified melodies that sound a bit like the songs but don't have all her crazy-amazing accompaniment.""Never is a Promise"" is the standout piece here-- really quite good. The rest are kind of dull. Yes, it's her music, but it's lost all its soul.Buy this is you want to play Fiona songs casually for fun, but don't expect to be able to rock out or sing along: it just sounds kind of silly without all her wild key-thumping accompaniment."
3,Normal,Es un tripode básico a un buen precio. No es una herramienta profesional. Es liviano y facil de cargar. Se desarma con facilidad. Se desajunsta muy facil.
3,didnt fit propoerly to Nikon3100..good quality though,didnt fit propoerly to my Nikon3100...quality is good..the telescopic options works really good but to tight the actually camera sufficient grip is not available...the small tripod available is alright good quality than any other options...
2,"Cheap, easily breakable, & unstable","I was not expecting it to be very strong and top quality, but then I was also not expecting that I will get a broken piece right out-of-the-box. Yes, its one leg was broken and it looked like that somebody has tried to fix it using all-purpose glue. There must be some quality check prior to shipping by Amazon. Anyway, I returned it and got my money back.However, I still explored this tripod. It sounds cool to have an extra small tripod and the ability to mount the flash a bit above the camera, using the unique setting they have. But they need to make it better quality and more stable to make this idea work well. I would rather get a Slik in similar price range."
2,You get what you pay for..,"Great deal in terms of cost, but the tripod is cheaply made and breaks very easily if you are not careful at all times."
1,Very poor quality,I just got this tripod and it has $8 written all over it. It's very low quality and I wouldn't recommend it.
1,not worth the money,"I wasn't expecting much for what I paid, but this is truly not worth any money.Flimsy at best, I wouldn't use this.Amazon packaging was great, but.....don't bother ordering thiseven if you only have a tiny camera."
3,ok for price but broke on first use,for $11 it's hard to complain but the first time i used this it broke. the plastic holding the legs broke off as i was spreading them out. i fixed it with crazy glue. probably won't last. otherwise good deal. just treat it very carefully.
3,Too short,"The exact measurements is 4 feet and 42 inches tall. This is too short for a person who wishes to film a tall building or things up high in the sky. The carrying bag, which can be used for additional accessories is a nice tease, but the bottom line is filming for me. I found another tripod for around $ 60.00 that is 5 feet 4 inches tall."
1,7-1 Joke,At such a great price.. Of course I bought two.. Hoping I would make at least 3 actualy 4 hour uses out of it.. Boy was I wrong.. The unit looks great and will hold a nice size camera (weight wise); Issue is the hinges and other items fall apart..Worth $5 and free shipping not worth a more than 3 time use..ZERO STAR
2,quality is not great,Buy this only if you plan to use it indoor and with small point and shoot or light weight camcorders.Not suitable for outdoor.I bought it for a DSLR. This does not hold its weight properly
1,let down,"I was very excited to receive this tripod but was sad to find it arrive to me package fine, with the top part broken off inside."
1,Totally Terrible,"I understand that this is a VERY cheap tripod, but it is in no way even decent. It is built out of cheap plastic which makes it very light, and easy to break. Pieces start snapping off from the second you take it out of the box. It cannot turn smoothly and makes a creaking noise when it is moved. I know that I did not get a lemon because I have read the other reviews.You may think that this would be good because it is a ""cheap and light tripod"" but it is NOT worth the investment, even getting a 50 dollar tripod (yes it is expensive) would be more inteligent. None of the cool features like the multi-angle viewing works. Unless you have an EXTREMELY light camera, this will either collapse under the weight, or not stay steady!!!!"
2,You Get What You Pay For...,"I knew a shouldn't expect much out of a $15 tripod, but this was awful. The plastic is cheap and starting to break and a screw broke. Plus, it can't even hold one of my camera's because the screw on the shoe is too small... WOOOOOW..."
2,5 dollar will break your camera,"I got it for $5.63 and it is an okay light weight tripod the bag is great it has room for most point and shoots and mirror-less cameras but should you put $100-$600 or more on this no, not at all! I will say one thing is that it is small light and portable. It is great for small cameras that are very light a super easy to put in an overnight bag."
5,Great unit for the price,"I only paid $5.57 for the Sctichkit, it was FBA and arrived quickly. The Swtichkit is exactly what it says it is in the add."
3,It's what you would expect for $16 but still not bad.,"I kind of had hoped it would be a little sturdier tripod, but it's what you can expect for $16. Still not a bad little tripod for a still camera. I especially like the 5"" accessory. That alone is worth the price."
3,Great for what it is,"Piece of throw away gear. I ordered it, and the legs flex really bad with a dslr with a very light lens. However, I would not be afraid to leave it on a stroller at Disneyland. I ordered two more for when I do not want to risk my good tripods. Great for what it is for. A piece of gear you are not afraid to lose. However the mini-tripod is awesome, and fits my cameras better than the $20 one I have."
1,Good design; flawed in construction,"Pity, isn't it? I ordered this tripod with a Lumix LX5 Camera, hoping to get a; as it says, nice lightweight travel tripod. It worked as that and I ignored the harsh smell of cheap lubricants and plastic from the tripod. That is, until it began to fall apart. Within a few hours, the plastic bolts had cracked, and the shaft fell. Upon inspection, I noticed it was because the bolts had stripped the lining of their sockets, and so it would be impossible to fix the shaft. In other words, I lost about 6-10 inches of height. Other parts cracked too, thankfully not crippling more the tripod. However, I do have to praise the portability of the tripod, even though it sacrifices sturdiness as well as...build quality. The entire set folds up into a small case, and the case can fold up into a smaller case just for your camera. To sum it up, the tripod has some excellent features and design, but poor construction and sturdiness make it NOT worth your money."
1,Great Until Used...,"This product looked great, was very compact with a miniture tripod built in. Very portable, great carrying case. Where did it go wrong you ask? We used it. I gave it to my wife as a gift, see if she would actually use a tripod as so has began advancing her skills in amateur photography. My wife used the tripod twice. Once to set it up after unwraping, the other was when she set it up to take a family protrait at Christmas. Upon taking the camera off, the top plastic cracked rendering the tripod unuseable. I suggest looking elsewhere."
2,"Nice case, but poor tripod.","The case is fine, but the full sized tripod is flimsy. I purchased three for a field project and one broke on first use. Super glue fixed it. Overall, I am OK having made this purchase because the overall cost was reasonable. If you want something that's rugged, however, I'd stay away from this product."
4,Nifty little tripod,Great little multi tripod for lighter cameras. only complaint I have is although it was represented as new condition the bag had a tear in it. Otherwise a 5 star item if used properly.
5,Cheap but effective.,"It's not the most sturdy tripod in the world, but for the price and all it comes with (the carrying bag is great!) it's definitely worth it for a quick cheap starter kit. Great for travel because it's super light and compact!"
5,Incredible layout!!!,"I bought this book for my plant biology class. Even though I was required to only study about 3/4 of it, I read the entire thing from cover to cover. If you want to find out about plants and the natural world, take a course with this book or just buy it and read it like a good non-fiction book. The layout and format are very modern and appealing. There are sections on ecology, which are very important in understanding what is happening to our environment right now. Plus, the book doubles as a plant reference/gardening book because it has a monster appendix with stats and care information on tons of common and rare plants you might grow at home. Wonderful book, you won't be disappointed if you are curious about natural science!"
4,For Botany Class,"Saved $140 by getting this older edition compared with the newer edition with all of the same information. Makes it a little bit more difficult to follow the syllabus, but its worth it IMO."
3,Introductory Plant Biology,I used this book to help develop the botany nomenclature for our teacher training program. This book was too high level for what I needed.
2,Full of inaccuracies on plant & animal systematics!,"This text has one strong point in the physiology and economic botany chapters. The systematics are at best antiquated. Poriferans are not ""Protoctistan"" (????) and Gymnosperms Cycads, Ginkgoes, Gnetophyta, and Conifers are in their own DIVISIONS instead of Classes of Pines. This is not a good text for anyone that is going to introduce plant systematics (classification)."
5,My child's favorite toy,"My 1 1/2 year old son loves this toy! He spends a lot of time taking it apart and putting it back together. When we need something to occupy him, we get this toy out! It has been excellent!"
4,"Great read, great gift for an aviation lover.",I read this book over 10 years ago and I still find myself recommending it to friends with aviation interests. I've given it as a gift several times. Great read for someone who has some knowledge of naval aviation. You can get lost thinking of being in Paul's shoes while reading it. Highly recommend.
5,"Feet Wet takes through training, combat and carrier ops.","Feet Wet takes the reader through flight training, combat, and carrier operations as seen through the eyes of Adm. Gillcrist. Stories told will keep you on the edge of your seat and periodically make you laugh. The book is informative to pilots as well as aviation enthusiasts."
5,Feet Wet,"I thought I was going to go into fit's of unstoppable laughter reading this book. One of those You just can'tput down till it's done. The sidewinder in the cockpit had me in tears, as something quite akin happened to a good friend, lobsters loose in a Tomcat, not snakes, but funny just the same. Same said for the agent orange portion of the book.F-8's on 27 Charlies, were a handful, Great body of work and told in laymans terms. Was around for the tail end of the F-8's and then Turkey's. Bold used to get the job done, quite the change from today's Navy. Thanks for writing this, haven't laughed that hard in years"
3,This one has button eyes versus sewn eyes - not good,"I searched for a year to replace my dogs inky the octopus by ty bow wow beanie babies. They are the most durable toys and my dogs love them. However, when I got this one, it had button eyes versus the customary sewn eyes. My dogs tore the buttons off and out comes the stuffing - the toy is ruined. Make sure you get the sewn eyes."
5,"Deep, rich tone!","I love these chimes! I bought the 86"", (I don't know what I was thinking in terms of length; however, they have such an authentic tone - check out the audio sample!) They are hanging from the eaves near my bedroom window, away from my next door neighbors. It is soothing and the tone low enough that I can enjoy them but it won't disturb anyone. They are heavy, 15 lbs, so it takes more than a gentle breeze to make them chime. I highly recommend if you're searching for a genuine cathedral bell sound."
5,Beautiful sound of church bells,This was a mother's day present and they do sound like church bells. My wife and I saw these while vacationing and she loved them. They do actually sound like church bells. Just keep in mind that these are very tall and you need a height 9 to 10 feet for these to catch the wind without touching the ground. We already knew this but if we didn't then it would have been a problem. Ours hangs in a tree branch a little over 11 feet high with close to 2 feet from the tree branch and about 1 foot off the ground.
5,Amazing Windchime!,"This was shipped super fast, in a wonderfully protective package and it arrived via FedEx on my doorstep days before I expected it. This is going to be the best Christmas present ever for my Mother. It is 60"" in height and sounds JUST like the Westminster bells. It is amazing how clear and long it sounds. You won't be disappointed!"
2,Just Not Practical,"If you are looking for a book that can inspire you, perhaps this is it. However, I just didn't find this book to be practical in the least. Every room was so over the top, you wonder how anyone could accomplish anything in these apartments. I understand the idea of a haven, but i kept thinking about all of the dust that could get stuck in all of the billows of fabric and trinkets that were were literally wall-to-wall in every room. And where to sit? Where do you eat? There was NO ""virgin"" space that could be considered useful.I consider myself to have a pretty open mind, but nothing in this book was worth keeping. I returned it the day I recieved it. I agree that any of Rachel Ashwell's books would be a better buy than this. Her books are great for inspiring your home, but also inspire party ideas and treasure hunts."
2,not worth it,"I bought this book and now I am returning it. I think it has some good general ideas - e.g. how to paint your apartment, how to select things at a flea market, etc. But the pictures of actual results are uninspiring. This may simply be a difference in taste, but I think the author, whose book aims at relatively young people, decorated apartments very much in granny style. If you see the pictures, you'll know what I mean. The bottom line: the general idea is great, but the implementation is uninspiring."
1,WASTEFUL,NOT AT ALL WHAT I EXPECTED. THE WEBSITE IS MORE INFORMATIVE THAN THE BOOK. I VISITED THE BOUTIQUE AND HAD A GREAT EXPERIENCE. EVERYTHING IN THERE IS BEAUTIFUL. HIGHLY RECOMMEND A VISIT BUT THE BOOK IS A TERRIBLE WASTE OF MONEY.
5,"Absolute must-have for the ""posh"" look on a budget.","This is by far my favorite decorating book. It is filled with more hints and tips to get that ""jewel box"" or ""genie bottle"" effect than any I've read. If you are creating a very elaborate, whimsical living space and need some inspiration...this is the book to get! This is the book to bring out the fairy tale prince or princess in anyone. Wonderful budget advice also. I love this book!"
2,This book could of been so much better...,"The Author is to me a hypocrite... She goes on and on in this book about cheap chic and decor on a budget, decorating an entire apartment for under 1800 dollars, but on her site, it is nearly impossible to find furinutre under $2000! The make overs turned perfectly fine apartments into rooms loaded withe ugly 50s and 60s garbage. I would highly recommend the garage sale decorator's bible by shelly kincad instead. It lacks photos, but the info is wonderful!"
1,Over the top,"I went to school in Paris and have spent much of my adult life commuting back and forth to Paris. I bought this book because it seemed relevant to my life. BUT I have never seen a Paris apartment that looked anything like these. I have no idea why they call the book Paris Apartments. If you want your apartment to look like it's right out of the ""red light"" district, a cabaret, or the Moulin Rouge, go ahead and buy this book. Otherwise, don't waste your money."
2,She is a hypocrite,It is absolutely true what one reader said about this woman and her book......a flea market budget? yeah right! A flea market for the rich and famous maybe....but not an ordinary joe. Its so true check out the website and you will see for yourself! comforters for like 600$....come on get real and if that is an indication of the rest of the products i didnt even bother to look......
2,"Too, too much!","I love old, glamourous things, pieces with history and beauty. There are plenty of them in this book, but as a decorating guide, I found it a little too rich for my taste. Some rooms are over the top, and some, to me, are hideous! But taste is a very individual thing. Rachel Ashwell's Shabby Chic books are more my style, I think."
2,not what I expected,"this has been on my want list for a year or more, and I finally found a copy at my library. I am SO glad I didn't buy this. It is way, way too overdone for my taste, and in no way does it reflect any element of french style that I've seen. I'd consider myself a francophile, but even Versailles looks restrained in comparison to Strasser's layers upon layers upon layers. I'd hate to clean in any of these rooms. There are some good ideas, like the rinceau treatment of the warehouse room turned parlor, but they were largely hidden under swaths of satin and clutter. I'd hoped for more depictions of true french designs."
1,Of no value,"This book has no interest for someone interested in decorating. Very boring, not enough photos. A real vanity book."
4,it is okay.,"it is a used book, so there are some notes the previous owner might wrote down and the corners of book was a little damaged. but overall, the condition is good."
4,View,Simple to execute. Contains relevant examples. Makes a tough subject easy. This book also helps in reading research articles and papers.
4,"Great book, I love it","It is extremely helpful for me. I love this book so much. However, the arrival is a little delayed."
1,Dark Horse? Talk About Fixed Racing,"I only paid 60 cents in a used bookstore for this piece of tripe, but figured I used to live in Texas and like political stories, so ..... Then, I found the book so bad, so ridiculous I had to keep going to make sure it would be on my list of real stinkers. It is. Just because you write for films, doesn't make you an author. The writing was not bad, but I would suggest Mr. Richardson pay someone to give him a decent plot. Additionally, the stereotype description of Texas and its citizens is quite insulting - very Hollywood. So it's been sold and will be made into yet another bad movie. It is really a shame and I did not find it ""fun"" or ""enjoyable"" because it was not good satire, it was just plain awful.You can be sure if this guy keeps writing (I see it did write another which sounds even worse), I won't be reading and anyone who has good taste should avoid his books as well."
2,Life imitates art,"This book isn't much more than a novelized screenplay -- kind of a ""Cape Fear"" in a political setting -- and I can't recommend it to anyone. But for those questioning its credibility: a state Senate candidate in Tennessee has just been charged with the murder of his opponent, a heavily favored incumbent who was killed on his farm. The parallels pretty much stop there, but it's still eerie."
5,Fast and Fun,"I am amused by some of the negative reviews which accuse this book of being too outlandish and unbelievable. I love to read, and when I pick up a book I want to be entertained. Reality checks are not a prerequisite. And there is a lot in this book that outrageously defies reality. Which is why it is so much fun to read. I zipped through this book, laughing out loud (which made my poor husband believe I had gone over the edge). Shakespeare McCann is so unbelievably evil you almost gotta love him. (I see Jack Nicholson playing him in the movie, if it is made). I don't think the author expects anyone to take this book as a serious indictment of our political system. This is pure and simple entertainment. To take it seriously is to ruin the fun. Just read it for the sheer enjoyment of a good yarn."
4,Easy to read yet a rather uncomfortable presentation,"The antics of ""Dark Horse"" candidate ShakespeareMcCann and the drug and alcohol addiction of Mitch Dutton own wife, turn what appears to be a sure bet into a cliff hanger in this Texas election for the a seat in the House of Representatives.The unbelievable situations which continually disrupt the campaign strategies of Dutton and continually narrow the gap between the two candidates, are presented in such a manner as to create an aura of fear and concern for the reader!I look forward to more from Doug Richardson."
5,Dark Horse Tells Tale of Texas Politics,Doug Richardson elevates the tale of small-town Texas politics into an exciting thriller. It makes readers wonder what happens behind the headlines
3,good stuff,If you want to relax and unwind this is a great cd for that.It reminds me of Tia Knight who is alsomagical.
3,Parade of Drones,"Deep space drone/deep ocean drone/3am in the forest drone/ghostly drone/somethings bout to happen drone all proceed across your field of subconsciousness in no hurry to get anywhere. Somewhere around the 6th drone around the 30 minute mark an unobtrusive funky rhythum takes sidestage for just a few minutes (?). Then back to the drone parade. The CD drifts away in a slow sigh and a curious insectual argument pattern. ""Superficial Depth""...The title for this project is self-fulfilling. ""Superficial"" Yes, because all there really is are a bunch of drones. Interesting and fulfilling indeed, but still synthesized drones. ""Depth"" Ah, the more you listen to these drones the more engaging they become. This is a great Think Tank CD. Allowing different moods/drones to stimulate different thought currents. Background study music? Well...yea...but I hate to use any ambient music as just background filler. Turn up the volume and think!"
2,Good and Bad,"Great CD, terrible DVD. Just buy the CD, The DVD isn't worth using for a coaster. I've seen better video on cell phones. Oh yea, the audio on the DVD is as bad as the video."
2,The DVD quality is terrible,There is a much better bootleg from San Francisco (same tour) with much better quality. And that is sad.
5,Loved it!,"My baby and I really like this book - it's simple and easy to read and I don't need my baby to pay full attention to me when reading (his attention spam is still really short - all he wants is to put it on his mouth!) I love the colors and pictures in it, plus it's in both languages! My husband and I are doing Spanish and English so this is just PERFECT.Very recommended!"
2,bad buy,"few pictures, few words. Could have more writing on it. Maybe for a baby could work... Book description is not helpful.I don't think it is intriguing or that has charming illustrations."
3,Kinda short - but good,The book is very short and does not relay a lot of information but the statements listed in the book are relevant to everyday life. I bought this for my son who was interested in learning spanish and he will say some of the phrases from this book often.
3,How do I feel bilingual book,"I thought this was a full size paperback, but it was a small book. Still, the person I gave it to was pleased, and is using it in her classroom."
4,Wish the book size was bigger,"The book is sturdy and well made, but was surprised at how small it is. Good book for beginner Spanish."
2,"Bad use of the verb ""sentir"" and small","I am disappointed with the book because I thought it was going to be about feelings, as in emotions, but it only has two feelings- sad and happy. The rest are states of being- such as hot, cold, thirsty, hungry, sleepy and silly. Plus, the verb sentir is not really used in Spanish to express all those. For example to say ""I feel hungry"" would be better said ""Tengo hambre"" rather than ""Me siento con hambre"", same with ""tengo frío"", ""tengo calor"" and ""tengo sueño"". Silly is a toss up, not quite an emotion, more of an adjective to qualify someone's personality. oh, well... The translation is literal, and that does not work the majority of the time.The book is also very small, with 8 words in it you are paying 50 cents per word, and the illustrations are not very exciting either. I'd say spend your money on another product."
2,Me siento CON sed ... ***WHAT...???***,"I wouldn't buy this book because we don't say ""Me siento con sed / hambre / etc"" ... (Yes, technically, you CAN say it that way, but the idea is lost in translation. The book is trying to teach ""I am thirsty / hungry / etc"" but is using a form that would be better suited for a phrase something like ""I have an incredible thirst""We say ""Tengo sed / hambre / etc"" ...Wow ... a book incorrectly teaching Spanish"
2,Not what I expected,"We're trying to teach our daughter Spanish from an early age (she's 8 months), and reading stories to her each night. This book is pretty simplistic with two - four words per page (""sad, con triste"") so it's over pretty fast. Perhaps for an older toddler who can interact a bit more and understand the meaning it would be suitable but it's not helpful right now."
3,almost too simple,"My twins like this book more than I do, so I'm giving it 3 stars rather than 2. It's very simple and the pictures are bright and colorful enough to hold a toddler's attention. I don't like the first picture representing ""feliz"" as I think it is misleading. It is a bird with notes coming out of his mouth- doesn't represent ""happy"" so much as ""singing"". Overall, it is a cute, simple, and very small book that seems to work for toddlers, but not any other age group."
5,Perfect self protection knife,"This knife stays in my pocket when I'm out alone (I'm a woman) and it gives me some comfort of self protection. The assist opening is the best thing since sliced bread! It opens with just a single motion of your finger. The quality of this knife is first class, and the sharpness of the blade's edge is impressive, also the body of the knife feels light yet substantial in your hand. I'm very pleased."
5,Outstanding Quality - Great knife for my husband!!!,We looked high and low for this knife. The pricing could have been a bit better though. My husband loved this and it was a great suprise for him when he unwrapped his gift. Fast shipping. Thanks!!
1,BETTER OFF BUYING ELSEWHERE!,"Ridiculous buy! Thought would get something spectacular for expensive price of $5.29(not to mention.the larger s/h of $5.97 for this relatively small and lightweight item). I couldn't get to a local hardware store to buy the same or similar(would be less expensive);sorry I didn't wait. Also, paint from pen has little to no luminescent properties;covers like chalk."
1,Empty pen,"The product may be fine if you don't get an empty pen. It felt light when I took it out of the package and when I shook it like the packaging said there was no fluid moving in the pen. When I pressed the tip up and down on scrap cardboard by the instructions, the tip stayed perfectly white. No paint whatsoever.It is not eligible for return according to the orders page. It would be nice if they sent me a replacement, but there does not seem to be a place to request one.Maybe it would be smarter to buy it in a store where you can at least shake it to be sure there is paint in it.This is the first totally unsatisfactory product I have received from Amazon and it is not terribly expensive, but still ..."
1,Let Down,I bought expecting it to be high quality from Krylon. However the paint was so thick that the button inside could not mix it to break the fluid. I never made it function and I ruined the tip by consistently trying to unclogg it. I really hoped it would work for me. Purchase at your own risk.
5,Stunning,"Another member of Sharp's unbeatable LCD TV family:1. Great LCD panel: 32"" diagonal, vivid colors, stunning clarity, very good black-level quality, no dead pixels (cheaper brands often have dead pixels)2. Great styling: looks absolutely beautiful, in the living room or bedroom or your fancy bathroom3. Lots of inputs: digital inputs, component inputs, PC input. HDTV tuner is not built-in, though, so you'll need a separate HDTV tuner, which is fine since you likely need to get an HDTV cable or satellite service like VOOM anyway4. Simplicity: the set-top connector box hides all the wires5. Easy to set up and useBTW, the ""32GD4U"" model (with a D) has a built-in HDTV tuner, but it's also hundreds more. This present model (without the HDTV tuner) is definitely the better value."
2,$95 underwear!?!?!?!,"I simply purchased these underwear because the list price was $95 (I paid $7.44). Honestly, I was just curious as to what in the world would make someone pay $95 for a pair of underwear. Apparently, it is the Versace name because I can't see any difference between this underwear and the brands I can find at the mall for less than $20. Of course, I ultimately paid less than $8, so I guess they would be fine at that price. The other problem is that I ordered size extra large, since that's what the sizing chart specified for a size 14. Well, I couldn't even pull them all the way up! I ended up giving them to my daughter who is a size 4/6 and they fit her perfectly. All that being said, my daughter does love the underwear. I guess if you're a size 4 and only paying $7.44, they would get 5 stars."
4,Good buy,"These are worth buying. They run about 1/2 to 1 full size small, so order up one size. They don't seem to be luxury panties, except that the waistband reads Versace. They are good cotton panties, though not as comfortable as others (Ex. Victoria's Secret sig. panties). The only detail I would add is that the seat only provides moderate coverage, so they do ride up from time to time when wearing. That is why I gave them 4 stars instead of 5. For the price (and brand) they are worth buying."
1,Liberal Modern Theology,"This ""catechism"" is written from a Liberal Modern Theological point of view. It should be titles ""An Episcopal Church Catechism for Liberal Members of the Church of England"" NOT ""An Anglican Catechism"". Very dissapointing.Fr. Michael+"
3,Balanced but nothing new.,"""A Washington Tragedy"" is a balanced account of Vincent Foster's death but it contains too many viewpoints and no new information. Like ""Rashamon"", it's literally a bibliography of sources but it neither enlightened nor entertained this reader."
3,smartwool gloves,Not your typical trusted Smartwool performance.......these run large so order next size down. These don't perform as well as their socks. Just so so. Swobo has them beat by a mile!!
2,For the beginner,"Pretty basic and definitely geared toward the novice IT professional or procurement area.Having spent over 20 years selling various IT products and services, most of her examples are over-exaggerated or just plain silly."
1,Unethical (and Inffective) Advice,"Although the book contains some useful information, the authors advocated several unethical business practices, including lying, stalling, and micromanagement. Their advice was ""cheat them before they cheat you."" In 20 years of dealing with IT vendors, I have found that working WITH vendors, in an atmosphere of trust and mutual respect, is a much more effective strategy."
2,Not as great as I had hoped....,"The story for me was a little dull and it took me a while to get into the story and the main characters: Brand and Marion. In fact, I was enjoying the secondary characters of Emily and Andrew's interactions together. I wouldn't be surprised if they get a book of their own. I just wasn't convinced of a romantic, loving relationship between Brand and Marion. However, I did get into somewhat ok mystery and I do have to say that the best part of the book is when the mystery was solved and who the person was behind it. Now that was totally unexecpted.It's an ok book but not as good as some of the author's previous books."
2,This was definitely NOT my cup of tea.,"I disliked both the hero and heroine. They were two-dimensional, stiff-as-boards people.Brand should have taken care of David Kerr - not Ash. I think if I were Marion, I would have fallen in love with Ash instead. Ash did more for her than Brand. As soon as Brand heard that David and Marion were alone together, he should have immediately run to her aid. Instead, he sends Ash. What was more important...his politics or his woman? Very disappointing for a hero.The heroine is dull. And the dialogue borders on cheesy - ""Love me, Brand, love me."" Just didn't float my boat.The love scenes are as boring as the characters. This book is much more mystery and far less romance. The whole mystery is absurd and not worthy of all the build up.I cannot recommend this book."
2,"Good mystery, mediocre romance","What I learned from this book is that Elizabeth Thornton is a talented mystery writer, but I wasn't feeling it with regard to the romantic connection between Brand and Marion. Yes, they were well fleshed out but Marion was waaaay too judgemental and often annoying for me to buy into a man like Brand falling for her. I suppose the saying ""you can't choose with whom you fall in love"" can be used as an excuse here. What I found much more riveting was Andrew and Emily's relationship. I looked for a followup book devoted to their story and found none, disappointing really. Thusly, what saved this book from being DOA for me was the mystery and E & A's relationship."
1,Not her best effort...,"This is by far, the worst book Elizabeth Thornton has ever written. It felt like entire chapters of the storyline and character development were missing. I didn't care about either of the main characters and only finished reading the book because I thought it had to get better at some point. I love Elizabeth Thornton's other books - but I was happy when this one was done."
2,Only If You Like Disgusting Things,"Chew on This by Eric Schlosser and Charles Wilson is about fast food and how bad it is for you. There are a lot of different stories in the book. One was about schools taking out soda machines and putting in water and healthier drinks, but still having McDonald's and Burger King which is even less healthy.Chew on This was not my favorite book. I am a vegetarian so the meat part made me gag. The book takes a long time to read; it feels like forever. The things that I don't like are when they explain how they kill a chicken and that pink lemonade is really made from bugs. I know that the facts are disgusting, but it is awesome how bugs can turn lemonade pink. The purpose of writing the book is to convince the customers not to eat at fast food restaurants. I suggest that you only read this book if you like reading about disgusting things.Adrienne F.Grade 6Ms. Kawatachi"
1,Warning - Don't let you child read this book if he/she still believes in Santa,"Warning - Do not let your child read this book if he/she still believes in Santa Claus. My daughter was totally psyched about this book. So much so that she wanted me to read it when she was done. Until...she got to the part that said the only fictional character better known than Ronald McDonald is Santa Claus. She has decided that instead of being titled, ""Chew On This: Everything You Don't Want to Know About Fast Food"" that this book should be called, ""Chew On This: Everything You Don't Want to Know About EVERYTHING."""
5,Chew on this...,"What an eye opener. Not only does this book share the history of how fast food has changed this nation, but it also shares how appalling the conditions are for employees and animals alike. A must read if you eat out regularly."
2,Not nearly as good as Fast Food Nation,This book misses the charm and humour that made Fast Food Nation such an interesting read. This book is just a droning anti-corporate rant that takes itself far to seriously.
5,Chew On This: Everything You NEED to Know About Fast Food,"Finally! A book revealing to the public the horrors of our nation's ignorance and heartlessness, and what major corporations are becoming. Chew On This is a wonderfully writen book successfully made to inform the reader on the unnecessary and sinful processing our country partakes in. Chew On This helped to open our nation's eyes to the unsustainably harvesting and genetically modifying major processing companies support, and how they treat their workers while doing so. When it comes to a topic such as this, no news really is good news for our country. With major companies paying millions to hide the truth, the general public pays no attention to the horrific actions they are supporting. Chew On This allows its readers to take a stand against the companies that truly rule the food production, and to give the public the option of having the knowledge they deserve."
5,Fast Food Nation For Youngsters - An Important Book,"This is an extremely well written and important book. It's not intended as a ""sequel"" to Fast Food Nation (another reviewer complained that the book didn't add much as a sequel). This is a REWRITE of Fast Food Nation for a YOUNG AUDIENCE -- something this country has needed desperately for a long, long time. Young people are now more obese than ever -- as a result, they're struggling with more health problems than any previous generation and setting themselves up for a lifetime battling diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, cancer ... This book should be required reading for every child, teen and parent."
5,A great book written to educate our younger generation about healthy eating choices!,"I possibly think that the reviewer who did the 2 star on this book totally missed that boat, he says that the prose seems to be ""written for children to read"". Bingo ... it IS INTENDED for the 9-13 year old audience. Fast Food Nation had a major impact on my life and changed the way my family ate, but it certainly was not somethig that my children would have understood or been interested in reading. Now with this important book, my daughter will also be able to understand why we should choose not to eat junk and fast food. Thank you Mr. Schlosser for caring enough about our younger generation to take on the fast food industry. I am sure they don't make it easy for you."
5,Love the simple things in life,"My 15-month old son LOVES this book ever since he was 9 months-old. We read it every night before he goes to bed. Taro Gomi has captured simple creatures in life and have made them animated and good teachers. The illustrations are purely magical. I highly recommend this book to kids, young and old."
5,Great modernist graphics!,"The artwork is first rate, deceptively simple, clean, and modern. A visual delight, and the message that kids can learn from everything and everyone is strong and healthy."
5,One of my daughter's favorite books!,"Our daughter loves this book! I bought it for her 1st birthday last year and it's been one of her favorites ever since. She has tons of books, but this is one she picks several times a day, every day! She'll have me read it to her over and over. I would highly recommend it."
2,Not as good as the rest,"This compilation, while a decent collection of trance and techno, failed to ""hit the spot"". Unfortunately, the quality seems to be deteriorating. Euphoria II and III were amazing collections. If only they could come back with that same magic."
4,Great for Parties,Digitally mixed is the right thing to say about this cd set... everything has a smoothe blend.. Its great for parties without a dj..
1,Cord doesn't fit new PS3,"As another poster pointed out, this does not fit the new PS3. Very frustrating."
1,doesn't work,"these cords dont work in the ps3 slim. On top of that they are possessed by demons from the nether realm. It calls itself Begolith, and it wants me to feed it cookies. It killed my wife and my dog, then drank the dogs blood infront of me. I shouldn't have bought these cableemnojihgekfgoibevsd98 fvk di7"
3,NOT FOR PS3 SLIM,"This cord came up as the first item in my search for ""PS3 power cord"". Only after I have received it I realized that it is not for the slim console. The cord itself is of a regular quality and will work just fine for the fat PS3."
1,BAD ps3 Power Cord,"They sent me the wrong item.I ordered a Ps3 power cord and even on the package it said Ps3 power cord, however, it was an extension cord. This is very upsetting because my new ps3's power cord was lost in the latest move from house to house.I need to return it immediately."
1,Does Not Fit,This power cord does not fit the new PS3 slim. Wish I would have known this before buying.
5,BE SURE TO CHECK SYSTEM CAPABILITY,"Loved the speed of delivery and price of product but not the product itself. I had searched for ""slim ps3 power cord"" and this shared that description. With no way to see the male end that actually plugs into the console it was a guessing game that wasted both my money and time. There are false claims about this cord being for the new slim model all over amazon so be careful. I ended up getting a chinese replica of mine at home for less than a buck and $1.50 shipping!!!"
5,Perfect Replacement!,"I needed a PS3 power cord to go with the PS3 my sister gave me, but had lost all the components to in storage. Came to my trusty Amazon, and found this guy for less than $8 + free shipping! Most stores in my area didn't even carry it, and if they did it was $15+. Very happy with it and I'd definitely recommend getting it here."
5,Good Compan,This group got my order to me quickly and in one piece which is the only thing they needed to do. I would buy from them a hundred more times.
3,Nice remote but you better be program savy first on have money!,I had the pronto neo for a long time and decide to upgrade after the buttons kept breaking off. This remote is better but still had to spend another 150 to get this programmed. This is not easy in anyway unless you really know your stuff when it comes to coding. The book is nice but this should be setup alot better for the average joe. It would be nice to see this having a pc software that you pick your items that you have and say what you want them to come on with. The Logitech company with the Harmoney remotes got this down pat. A friend has one of these and it's great. So in the end I would not buy again by Philips. I can't program unless I pay someone and it's useless since I paid for programming twice at a cost of [...]
3,"""ya, ya, ya""","Yes, that's right, fellow MxPx fans. I only gave it three stars. Mike says ""Ya"" like a thousand times during this album. It was really dissapointing to see them release this, cuz I saw them in concert last November at St. Andrew's in Detroit rock city, and they were dope! BUt this album really doesn't do them all that much justice, and I was just kinda mad that they chose to put this disc out the way that they did. A must for hardcore MxPx fans, Novices need not apply."
5,Good live CD!!!,"Of course nothing beats actually seeing them live, but the recording is decent. It doesn't really capture their power though. You see MXPX does their best with their older stuff, and if it were up to me they'd make one that would top Slowly Going the Way of the Buffalo or Pokinatcha, but sadly they decided to go and produce boring pop-punk stuff, but this CD will remind you of what they use to be. A definate must buy!!!"
2,What's up with the Live cd?,"MxPx is a great punk band. Catchy, yet powerful enough to draw in all kinds of punk rock fans. However, I was still upset to see them waste an album by putting out a live cd. Unless you have something radically different to do, like playing with the San Francisco Orchestra (Metallica's ""S & M"") or you don't own any of the previous MxPx albums, I don't really see a reason to pick up this album. MxPx is a great live band, they put on a tremendous show, but it's nothing that can be portrayed very well to CD. The only reason to purchase ""At the Show"" would be to hear the Ramones' cover song ""KKK Took My Baby Away"" otherwise the songs have not changed at all (although they do have some neat segues). I'll be excited to purchase their upcoming live video but for now, if you own any of the previous MxPx albums, this album is nothing new besides the two sentece talks between songs and crowd yells."
4,Darn good punk rock,"This is the one really essential album from MxPx.The band has made some good music in the past several years,but nothing spectacular.Then there's this great live recording.On this very well recorded album,I found renditions of mediocre songs blossom into soaring punk anthems.The vocals improved tremendously,as well as some of the guitar playing(notedly the guitar solos for tracks 1-3 and ""I'm Ok,Your Ok"").A few personal favorites include ""G.S.F.""(previously unreleased on any studio album),""I'm Ok,Your Ok""a cover of the Ramones'""KKK Took My Baby Away"",""Party,My House,Be There"",""Dolores"",and the insremental""The Theme Fiasco"".Live: At the Show deliveres good,high energy punk rock."
1,Written with bigotry and fanaticism,"The book is full of radical ideas and tries to brainwash with its single perspective. Death and violence is never an answer. They create more violence and death. Suicide as an act of death kills revolution and revolutionary thoughts. because it brings an end and it stops the search for ideals and utopia. Lack of support, wrong logic, intolerant, monolithic, logocentric, fascist. It need more voices and perspectives. It needs dialogue. Its author needs to read Mikhail Mikhailovich Bakhtin. Dangerous if readers do not apply critical thinking."
5,The best of Huey Newton's books.,"Dr. Huey P. Newton the man that today's youth does not know about tells how he first met Co-founder of the Black Panther Perty and this book is the closest thing to an autobiography you will find. All I can say is the greatist man that ever lived gives the American people a sense on Awareness that has not been given since Malcolm X. Made me wanna get up and shout""All Power To The People"""
3,Almost Nice,"Really well-written, but a bit misleading. Touted as ""an uproarious book"" by British critics, I found the book much more serious than funny, very tame. I really enjoyed the female character, Robyn. Very independent and intelligent, she was almost inspiring. I didn't enjoy the sexual situations. They were slightly out of character and seemed awkward. I did, however, enjoy seeing what each character learned from the other. A nice read, quick witted if not ""uproarious"", and seldom slow."
2,outdated,"Unfortunately, David Lodge's novel Nice Work is so dated it became incredibly irritating. References to Margaret Thatcher, Michael Heseltine, Jennifer Rush (?), etc. overshadow any possibility of this novel being in any way relevant in this day and age."
5,Guess Watch,This watch is very nice for the price. I am very satisfied and always have liked Guess watches. It looks very nice dressed up or wearing casual.
2,I can see him doing it but i can't see how,"Every book is a good book, but don't buy this one expecting to learn how to defend yourself from a grapler's attack. The book lacks essential details, that make all the damn difference. You can see him doing it but he gives you no real clue how it is done. You can learn much more on a single judo, wrestling or gracie jiu jitsu class. In fact, that's THE best way to learn how to deal with a grappler. Do not fool yourself."
4,A detailed account of close-quarter Dim Mak applications.,"The fourth book in Mr. Montaigue's Dim Mak series; this book provides advanced martial arts advice for ground fighting techniques. Contents include specific examples of Dim Mak strikes, which could be used in a close-quarter combat situations."
2,You're fooling yourself if you believe the title,"If there were any way Dim-Mak or any other art could consistently defeat Submission Fighting, they would do better at no-holds-barred contests. Since Grapplers control the distance in any fight, the only way to defeat them is to grapple better than they can. A word to the wise: don't become overconfident when reading this nonsense. Practice the techniques with a good submission fighter and you'll see what I mean."
3,mixed opinions,"I get the idea that the author is a very smart man with years of experiense under his belt. The book says a lot of really smart things and I could say it was one of the best ones I've read. The problem is that between these excerpts of greatness are countless expressions of empty promises that his way is better then any other. The moves seem logical enough but I seriously doubt that even the best book could ever defeat a style. He makes constant referances to ""the fools who still study Karate"" saying that sparring and kata and other things are no match for training your mind for adaptability. he also talks about the UFC like a playground, with such an extreame number of rule and regulations that the whole thing is safe and stupid. I truly think that takeing out eye and neck gougeing hardly makes it a foolish game."
3,"The ""sophmore slump"" has been a curse that many filmmakers have had to face.","Although ""Turnaround"" unsuprisingly doesn't have much to offer in terms of image/audio quality, the film itself is funny at worth checking out - especially for the low retail price of $9.99 - and less at most stores."
1,An Old Man's Opinion,Inane. Sophomoric. Phoebe Cates could not make up for the rest of the cast or plot (if there was one). Don't waste your time or money.
4,Cougar Attacks,"Cougar Attacks: Encounters of the Worst Kind is a good read. It gives a good history of cougar attacks in the US and also talks about some of the controversey associated with cougar attacks and hunting cougars in some states. Overall, it was a great read and really suppliments the book, The Beast in the Garden."
2,"An annoying, poorly disguised pro-hunting book","This book is portrayed as an objective review of cougar attacks in North America. Unfortunately it's true goal comes out after a few pages when the book's main theme is revealed - that if only the hunting of mountain lions was allowed again, these terrbile attacks would not have happened. Of course, the real experts do not agree that this is the case, so all we have here is the self-serving opinion of the author being shoved down our throats. The author it turns out, is a hunter. While the book boasts a foreward by Harley Shaw, Shaw's words try to counter the author's intended message, attempting to play down the author's conclusions by pointing out that human attack by cougars is a rare thing indeed. If I had known this was a pro-hunting book written by a hunter, I would not have bought it. ""Cat Attack"" is a far more objective book."
2,READS LIKE A LAUNDRY LIST,"Several compelling and hard-to-put-down books have been written about this subject. This isn't one of them. It can't be faulted on facts, but the writing is dry; it creates no atmosphere and never makes the people involved in these tragedies seem like real people and so evokes no compassion at all. ""(VICTIM'S NAME)was attacked by a (MALE/FEMALE) cougar while he was (CAMPING/HIKING/PICKING HIS NOSE) in (LOCATION) on (DATE). (NUMBER) stitches were required. The cougar (WAS SHOT/GOT AWAY/IS SITTING ON YOUR DOORSTEP AS YOU READ THIS).""For people interested in facts, compassion and good writing on this subject, I recommend TRUE STORIES AND HARD LESSONS FROM COUGAR COUNTRY and THE BEAST IN THE GARDEN. They are almost impossible to put down, without being sensationalist."
4,Interesting but not very mysterious,"This is the first Amanda Cross mystery I've read. I did enjoy it, but I must agree with the previous reviewer, who said that it was a good book but not much of a whodunit. The mystery really takes a back seat to literary discussions and character analyses. (And the ending, while fun, emerges out of the blue.) I also found that, especially towards the middle and end of the book, the characters all tended to speak in a mannered way that I found slightly improbable-- as though they're all declaiming instead of just talking.I picked the book up because it dealt with a women's college; as a student at a women's college, I'm always curious to see how they're treated in literature. I found Cross' view interesting, although nothing like my own."
4,great travel system but doesn't travel too well in small sedans,This is a great travel system. The car seat is great Graco quality and the stoller is much better than expected. The harnesses are so easy in the stroller and the temp/time feature is suprisingly helpful! The only problem is the stoller is SO big that it doesn't fit easily in our trunk. We have a smaller 4 door car and it takes up the whole trunk once we get it in there.
5,Great Product,"I recently went in to check out some travel systems. Out of all I tried out this was by far the best. It is NOT heavy at all, folds down effortlessly, very compact, and is loaded with features. I could not find a single thing wrong with this system, unlike every other one I tried."
3,Testing and Assessment,"It is an okay book. Some of the text is a little difficult to understand. So, it is not totally student friendly."
3,Pretty good,"I guess I was expecting old Native American poetry. This is all contemporary poets. Good, just not what I was expecting."
2,not apropos for the genre.......,"this story would have been a worthwhile contemporary romance, but the premise-a lord, lost in a blizzard, who stays with a widow alone for several days in her home-was just too far fetched in a Regency romance.In fact, the story read like a Harlequin contemporary set in Regency times-which if it would have been Regency England, the heroine would have been in disgrace for having a man stay at her home while she's not chaperoned. Not recommended. 2 stars."
2,Ben 10 Alien Laboratory,"My son (6 yrs old) really was excited to get the lab for Christmas. Not the best toy. This toy needs a lot of adult supervision, it has many little parts. The disc viewer is very blury, we haven't even touched the goop it came with. If your child is a big Ben 10 fan like mine all of that dosen't matter, he thinks it is a cool toy. I don't think it's worth it , but I'm not a 6 year old boy."
2,Save your money......,"I have two major complaints with this toy...1. It is not durable at all. My boys have not had much time to play with this toy yet, but there are all already plastic pieces broken off of the vehicle just from moving it around under the tree.2. There are a number of pieces included with this toy, and the vehicle itself is too small to store the accessories.It seems to be poorly built and poorly designed.The only reason I gave it two stars was for the alien forms that can be made in the beaker.This toy won't last long at our house before it sees the recycle bin."
1,Waste of money!,"My son saw this advertised on tv and begged for it for Christmas. I looked for it everywhere and finally found one last one on the shelf right before Christmas and thought it was a great score. Wrong! After playing with it for 10 minutes, watching the Alien ""balls"" fizzle like Alka Seltzers til they exposed a couple of cheap, plastic toys, he completely lost interest. The van is poorly constructed and the parts do NOT fit back in, nor does it stay together. Just TRY to store it on a shelf without it falling apart and spilling its contents everywhere. This piece of junk is going right in the give-away bag. And my son won't miss it!"
1,Misleading advertising,"Item description is entitled ' 18x24 stretched canvas 6 pack."" I felt misled by the product description. I thought I was ordering 6 canvases. Instead, the small print indicates that it is really only one canvas. Really need to read the description to understand what you are ordering."
3,Good but not great,Normally I build my own frames and stretch my own canvas across them. I bought these feeling all lazy one day thinking they would be just as good but they weren't. Four of them were okay and the other two were skewed beyond usability. I ended up stripping them of the canvas and applying it to my own frames.
1,So NOT worth it,"This really ticked me off to find out that I only got one when it clearly says that it's sold as a six pack. If it's possible I want my money back asap. I don't understand why some people are receiving only one and then there are the lucky ones who get all six, something tells me that those reviews are fake."
1,One Canvas? Bull-crap!,"We ordered the 6-pack for Christmas and only received one canvas. The actual title of the product says ""6pack"". This company is incredibly deceitful! We would never pay $40 for one canvas!"
1,6 pack - only received 1,"This item was listed as a 6 pack, and I have only received one canvas. Will the other 5 be shipping soon? Why is there no record of this? This is VERY disappointing - i certainly hope I didn't pay over $40 for one canvas."
1,Ordered a 6 pack of canvas's..received 1,"I ordered a 6 pack of 18x24 stretched canvas's which is a Christmas Gift. My order arrived today, I opened up the box, and had just 1 canvas, not the six that were ordered. Now I must go out and find 5 more canvases..this is so disapointing. It is was Sold by Hyatts Graphic Supply Co Inc (Hyatt's All Things Creative)..what a rip off !!"
1,misleading,"It said that I was going to get 6 canvases, but it was really only one. I have never created a review for any product, but this ticked me off too much not to. I hope people stop ordering from them."
1,JUST ONE CANVAS,"Not a six pack...well apparently it's a gambler's pack...you MIGHT get six, you'll probably get one. I got only one and now have to deal with packing this back up and returning it for a refund. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME."
5,As advertised,"Received Item promptly. Son needed for art class. Very expensive at hobby shop to purchase so I ordered these. Item is just as advertised, Received 6 individual canvas. Very good product. Will purchase again."
5,"you will get a 6 pack, don't worry",my 6 pack of canvasses arrived in due time. the warehouse now has a sticker on the package not to break the set and send only one canvas.
4,The title says it all,"BRUTAL, HEAVY, UNRELENTING, PUMMELING - this is ome of the heaviest and loudest DM bands out there. It just doesn't get any more extreme than this. If you have an adrenaline surge and need something vicious and heavy to satisfy your angst, put this in your player and hit ""PLAY"" and turn it up.For fans of VADER, VITAL REMAINS, EXTREME NOISE TERROR, FAILED HUMANITY, FLESHITIZED, MASSACRE, HYPOCRISY, MACHETAZO, BENEDICTION, and the ilk."
1,What happened to the cool face to face?,"As soon as i popped in the cd, i thought, ok...they have a slow song, it's decent, but its not punk. By the time I was 8 songs through, I realized that this is not going to pick up. Face to Face fans will be shocked to find a totally different band playing. This album truly disappointed me as i'm sure it will others."
1,I think it is safe to say that this is F2F's last album.,"It's a shame. Now that they've ruined their credibility, I doubt that they will be able to make a new album under any label. I can't help but think of the skit on Big Choice when they are talking to the record company exec. The irony is delicious!"
1,the worst CD I have purchased in the last 5 years,I could not believe how bad this CD was. I liked the last one but I could tell they were trying to progress and go in another direction. Its the wrong direction completely. They should stop recording and just play live if they are going to keep getting worse then this CD.
1,Surprisingly Awful.,"F2F has changed their sound, and it is not for the better. I was a big F2F fan until this album came out, but now that the band has made this album I have given up on them. Not only is it the worst kind of popular trash (imagine taking 3eb, The Goo Goo Dolls, and Matchbox 20, and puting them in a blender) , but it illustrate a complete lack of integrity. I don't recommend buying this album, or any other F2F albums for that matter. This is a band that deserves no support."
5,Six shooters and damsels in distress,"This is one of my favorite albums of all time and by far my favorite Face to Face album. They sound completely different and pull it off nicely. Every song is great and sounds completely unique. ""Heart of Hearts"" and ""Maybe Next Time"" are two songs that when you fight with your woman and need to feel even worse about it, you pop them bad boys in and you're good to go. My favorite song on the album is ""Protocol"". It kicks serious donkey. I've had this CD for close to 4 years and it hasn't got old yet. Although it is hard to make out thru all of the scratches and battle scars. And it has one of those f*cking sun spots that looks like a kid stood over it with a magnifying glass and burned a hole thru it. I need to get it again. And again if need be. And yes, even again, after it has been mangled 5 or 6 times, I will still get it again. Well, after two times, I'll probably just steal it off of the internet. Thank God for piracy and plundering swashbucklers."
5,only Face to Face cd i have,"I first heard of Face to Face by randomly listenting to this displayed album in a store. And i immediately fell in love with it. His existential musings are wonderful and are not pretentious to me. I've listened to the amazon samples of previous Face 2 Face cds, and i must admit, i prefer this one. This time the lead singer actually sings and not punk rants, which is important because I think he has a wonderful singing voice. The thrash of the earlier cds is gone but I prefer the melody this time around. I've heard enough thrashing punk rock. I love this cd."
2,it has nothing to do with maturity,"writing songs like this really doesn't have much to do with maturity. Face to Face was once a great band (Don't Turn Away was by far the greatest), but as a long time punk fan, Face to Face was never really very hard core. Very energetic, but not hard at all. I think I was just about as disppointed when Big Choice came out. They never should have left Fat.So this change doesn't really surprise me. Most of my friends stopped listening to F2F after Don't Turn Away. I guess I stop after the self titled (which blows Big Choice out of the water)."
4,"No ""Disconnected"" on here folks, take it or leave it.","Yes, Face to Face have slowed down the pace a bit, butseriously I cannot believe that ""Ignorance is Bliss"" isbeing panned so hard. Come on people. It's not like they went new age on us or anything. They're artists, and they have a right to space out their sound a bit, because surely they've gotten sick of playing loud, fast (albeit brilliant) punk rock. By the way, I saw them live recently and the new songs fit seamlessly into the set, so I don't see what the fuss is about. Tracks like ""Overcome"" and ""I Know What You Are"" are classic Face to Face, and then I like the slower songs the more I hear them. Certainly not as good as ""Big Choice"" but nonetheless great, and a major creative step for the band."
3,A different Face to Face,"Ignorance is Bliss is a good CD. The band has really matured and developed. Sure, it's nothing like what they've done in the past and it takes a while to get used to it but I think if you're a real fan you should accept this CD for what it is. Even though there are a lot of slow songs on this CD I still have yet to hear a Face to Face song on mainstream radio or even see a video, so they aren't selling out and I am sure you can still get crazy on the floor at their shows with some of the songs off this CD."
4,Good but slower face to face album,"Ok, It's not as good as the previous albums of Face to Face. Especially my favorite Big Choice. But it's still a very good album that has some getting used to. The first time i played it it was totally different from what i expected, but i still like it. Just listen to it ""open minded"" and don't expect a fast album."
3,Deceptive 3 star rating,"I am giving this CD a three star rating, even though, if it was released by any other band, I'd probably give it the full five stars. Taken on its own merit, this is a great disc -- solid songwriting, tremendous musicianship, insightful, dark lyrics -- but within the context of F2F's other stuff it seems to lose its edge. I mean, F2F have built their fan base on fast, chippy, melodic punk, so any deviation from that pattern is likely to alienate the people who so love it. The tunes are slower, but heavier in their own way, and some of the songs rank among the best the band has ever released. it's just different, and i guess we weren't ready for it.that said, i'm glad the band gave a go at something different (seems to me that this is something they wanted to do) and if you can pretend this CD is some other band, you've got a winner here. Now then, where did I put that fabulous LIVE CD?"
3,FACE TO FACE IS STILL THE BOMB,THIS CD IS OKAY TRACK 13 AND 2 AND 10 ARE GOOD IT'S IS GROWING ON ME THOUGH.
1,Everyone....the Face to Face has gone bad.,"I guess this is what age does to good punk bands. It's a shame, I tell you. They used to be good. They used to be real good."
1,1-Star Emo,"I doubt that the individual who wrote the review titled ""Five-Star Emo"" has even a vauge conception of what Emo is. To those who think this is a great album, I guess ignorance IS bliss."
1,It's bad!!!!!!,"To think I used to like this band. The only good song is Prodigal. Even then its just a mediocre song. What happened? What about don't turn away. I'm sorry but this is just bad. It's week, slow, boring, and all around bad"
1,Complete Change of Style and Sound,"Not to echo too many of the reviews here, but I have to say ""THIS IS NOT THE SAME BAND."" With the exception of Trevor's recognizable vocals, not one thing on this album would lead me to believe that this was FTF. Not one. It's an attempt, albeit a poor one, at Top 40 mainstream alt-rock. FTF is no longer a punk band, folks. Stick with Big Choice or their self-titled."
1,This is the worst stuff I have heard in a long time,"No offense to Face to Face or anything but this is the worst CD ever made. After making such a good LIVE CD, you come out with this poo. Do not get this but if you want to get a Face to Face CD, get LIVE because it is really good."
1,What in the hell happened to these guys??,"this album is without a doubt a total, and i mean total disappointment...... its not that its not fast its just that there is no rhythm any more... i regret buyin this... if u buy any face to face i recommend buying any of there old stuff.. but not this"
1,new album not worth dancing to.,"i have seen face to face more times than i can count and each time i loved them and they put on a great show. i didn't think there was a face to face song that i didn't like and everyone was special in its own way. when ever i felt down i would listen to them and it would pick me right back up and make me want to dance. ""ignorance is bliss"" is just to slow. i love the melodies but it sounds good with fast music. the new album is just slow dramatic, nothing like i expected. i am just afraid to see them now because i won't be able to dance to the new stuff. they need to go back to the ""don't turn away"" days and stay true to their fans istead of trying to reach the mainstream with their new album."
2,Why Change?,"Well...after waiting, and waiting and then waiting some more for this cd to come out...it finally did. I must say that the change was definitely not a plus in my book. The live album was SO good. My favorite live album by far. Now I'm afraid to go to a live show. I don't want to fall asleep. I don't hate this cd...I do like about half the songs, but it just isn't Face to Face. I certainly hope your musical tastes change once again, back to where they were."
2,To Each his own,"Well, it's funny how they went from a fast Cali-punk to a more emotional filled rock. It is not something I pictured Trevor Keith to ever do. Now, change is good because it shows the band has balls and the courage to do it. However, I think Face to Face went a little extreme on this album. Its not as fast, has a lot of different instruments tracks then before and shows a lot more to the band than the 3 chord songs on their previous albums. Basically the music is cool, but sometimes Trevor Keith's voice clashes with the music, making it sometimes annoying to hear. Id say buy it if you ve always been a big fan because it's good to see bands evolve over time. However, if you just picked up on them, I'd say keep away from this and stick to Green Day."
5,One of the years best CDs,"For those true fans who are willing to give this disc a chance, you will be greatly rewarded. Ignorance is a huge evolutionary step for f2f. Trevor Keith shows that he can write more than just good poppy punk songs. For other fans who are not adventurous enough to explore the new cd, then you ignorance is bliss, but unfortunately you'll miss out on a great musical accomplishment."
2,"Great Writing, Not Face To Face......","As usual, the songwriting by Trevor Keith is excellent. But, there is only one problem: This isn't the same Face To Face that recorded Don't Turn Away, Big Choice, Over It, Face To Face, and Face To Face Live, almost literally! Two of the three original Face To Face members are gone (Rob Kurth-Drums, and Matt Riddle-Bass). I expected more high energy, punk rock from Ignorance Is Bliss. I think that it's really terrible what this album did to the band. It's way to much of a change all at once. i really enjoyed the album, but I'd rather hear this music from the Foo Fighters on Third Eye Blind, not Face To Face. I was very upset and disappointed with this album. I hope that if Face To Face releases another album, it's more like Don't Turn Away, and not this %$#&! Reccomended songs: Overcome, Burden, Heart of Hearts, and I Know What You Are. If you are a first-time Face To Face buyer, buy Don't Turn Away (and read my review on it) Review By: Joseph Palazzo"
3,Decent but not quite what I hoped for.,"Face to Face has always had great musical skills and meaningful lyrics. This release is no exception. However, as it seems most bands do, they have ""mellowed out"" a bit in their style. The songs on this release, as a whole, are a bit toned down as far as tempo is concerned. The music is clean and tight and the lyrics are insightful but it is definitely slower than previous releases. If you are a first time Face to Face buyer, let me suggest their album Big Choice as a prime example of Face to Face's talent."
1,Is this a joke?,"I waited so long for some new face to face. I picked up the CD right when it came out but when I put it in my stereo the strangest thing happened. There was NO Face to Face!!! All I heard was some Collective Soul and some Oasis. I guess replacing Rob Kurth as their drummer was the last straw. Their unique fast-powerful-melodic style was obviously the product of ex-band members Matt Riddle and Rob Kurth. I did give ""Ignorance is Blss"" one star however because Trevor now has a beautiful quiver in his voice at the end of each line- just like N'Sync (how nice). This album is not horrible but it is NOT Face to Face. It is really slow and really weak. Profound lyrics can not save it. If you like old Face to Face style punk- PLEASE TRUST ME- You will NOT like this CD. I have been a huge fan for years and still am a huge fan, of the real Face to Face."
3,It's an Emo Experience This Time,"I am going to keep this short for you all! This album is more of an Emo type of music experience. A slight departure for F2F, but not a sell-out. Have no fear if Emo doesn't work for you, the band released another ""punk"" album. Reactionary is now out and includes songs chosen by the fans over the internet. An album for the fans prepared by the fans! Don't call them sell-outs. They are still punk icons giving the fans what they want."
2,From fast paced punk to failed emo band.,"It's kind of sad. Most of the bands that I loved have been making a steady decline. With Face to Face, it was so sudden, like hitting a brick wall. Don't get me wrong, I love emo, but this was awful. I'd like to suggest any Sunny Day Real Estate or Get Up Kids album instead of this. Words cannot express the horror that I felt when I listened to this album."
1,Face to Face Discuss the Next Album,"From Face to Face's web page, about the new album they are working on: ""I think many of you will be pleased to know that this next record will be a bit more raw and stripped down than ""Ignorance is Bliss."" If I had to give an example of what some of the songs are sounding like I guess I would say they are influenced by bands like Fugazi, Jawbreaker, The Clash, etc. It's definitely going to be a more familiar sounding album to most F2F fans, but not predictable.""At least they can admit how horrible this album was! I give them credit for that. :-)"
1,I wouldn't buy this album if it were in the 99 cents bin,"Do not buy this album. I know what you're thinking, how could it be bad, it's Face to Face? Well, it's awful. If you are a Face to Face fan and haven't heard this album, DON'T LISTEN TO IT! You will loose all respect for the band. You will grow frustrated and bitter and lead an unfulfilling life. In other words, you will be living in a van down by the river. Don't let it happen to you!"
1,Not One Good Song on the Whole Album,"I've listened to this album over and over, and with each listen it breaks my heart. Why, oh, why did they have to sell out? Now there are some people who claim that this new sound is good, and that is exactly what they were working for. To get people who know nothing about good music to buy their album. These people are called ""the general public"", and this was their target audience. If you want to listen to good Emo, buy Diary. If you want a failed attempt at a mainstream crossover, buy Ignorance is Bliss."
2,A Face to Face fan,"Ignorance is Bliss is the kind of punk you buy at the Gap. Totally off track! I understand that they are trying to grow, but their oldies are goodies!"
2,Huh?,"I was expecting a great punk album, but instead it sounded like the Goo Goo Dolls. F2F has sold out to reach a wider audience (and sell more records).."
1,Bonus Tracks Can't Save This Album,The bonus tracks can't help what turned out to be the worst album of 1999. It's a shame that this has happened to such a great band.
2,"total change of pace,but its only experimental","this album is only a experimental thing by trever and the guys...i have listened to some of there new material on mp3.com and its back to normal punk...the probably only decent song on ignorance is ""god is a man"" i like that song but the rest was no good what so ever.but i never gave up on face to face cuz they never sold out they just expermented."
4,I can't believe you all hate this...,"It's not that bad, people! Somebody said, ""stick with Green Day..."" What a joke! Why would you listen to Green Day when these guys are out there? The lyrics aren't exactly prolific, but this is an impressive album. ""Burden"" is absolutely incredible, and the whole album is melodic. Yeah, I know, it's not what you expect with punk, but it isn't classic rock. These guys are okay."
2,Not the same FACE TO FACE,"I remember when this was released, FACE TO FACE was one of my favorite bands. DON'T TURN AWAY, to this day is still one of my favorite albums ever made. This is not the same style of music at all. The fast, melodic style of 90's west coast skater-hardcore is gone. This is a ""grown up"" album full of slower, moody rock which is a major departure from their earlier material. To me, it was a major disappointment. Some of the songs are still good, but this band should have a different name, it's not FACE TO FACE after this record."
4,Face to Face's Best Written Album,"When this was released it was met with so much scrutiny they immediately went in and recorded the lackluster ""Reactionary"". Don't get me wrong, I love the old punk rock Face to Face but this album is just amazing. It is slower, a little more ""emo"" maybe. Definitley a huge step and a huge risk song-writing wise and I think it paid off brilliantly. I hate the fact people will diss a band because they stop being so ""punk rock"". That term is so cliche and lame. A band as good as face to face deserves to put out whatever style sound they want. This is definitley their highlight and most heartfelt release. I feel like Trever Keith is really throwing everything he has into this! Thumbs WAY up! Highlights: Burden, Heart of Hearts, I Know What You Are, The Devil You Know, Run In Circles *To really show how good this CD is. From losing or ruining my copies of this album I have purchased this in stores 4 totally different times. No joke. Never done that before.*"
4,Wonderful,Excellent book with vivid views of all major systems. Great for pelvic bone review and in general quick checks.
2,Usefulness depends upon area studying,"This book was not nearly as helpful as I expected it to be. The photographs and drawings seemed like they would be really helpful. However, I found it very confusing to try to figure out which picture corresponded to what my specimen actually looked like. It was most helpful for muscles, and least helpful for nerves and vessels. It is also very time consuming to look up the particular item and then flip through many pages looking for a picture that shows your item of interest clearly."
2,dont bother,works fine to soften dry under eye skin but doesnt help either puffiness or dark circles. any lotion could do the same thing. not worth the money!
5,A must have,I thought the book was very informative....... it is useful if your curious about this syndome. A must have in your library to refer to when needed.
2,Overview of Sjogren's Syndrome,If you knew nothing about Sjogren's this would be the book for you. I had read about this syndrome online so it really didn't tell me anything I didn't already know.
5,Fram trusted quality.,"Tried and tested many many times. I like fram because of price and convenience of finding one. I used to use store generic until I heard of the case against wally world regarding their super tech filters. Now, I just use this tried and time tested filter.BTW, the black bottom is actually a plus for hand tightening the filter. It's made of wrinkly dried paint. True convenience tool free installation."
1,Wrong Filter,"It was so convenient that Amazon provided pull-down menus to help you find the perfect filter for your vehicle. Too bad it's the wrong filter.This filter does not fit a 2004 Ford Escape 3.0 XLT no matter what they say. I needed to purchase something for around $4.00 at Christmastime to get free shipping. Although I didn't need it yet, I ordered the filter. Now it's February, past the return date, and the filter doesn't fit. Just be careful when using Amazon's part finder."
5,Best toy purchased!,I purchased this set of magna-tiles for my 5 year old grandson almost one year ago for his birthday. He has spent countless hours playing with these and receives so much pleasure from building with them. He has taken very good care of them and always puts them away in the original box. Money well spent!
5,Magna - Tiles 48 Piece DX Set,"This is a great toy that both my six-year old and two-year old love to play with. Its pieces are well made and can take the rough handling of my two year old. There are enough pieces to create a variety of structures. However, both love the car part the most and spend a lot of time using that to make different vehicles."
2,Weak magnets = very fragile construction,"We purchased this set and another smaller set for my three year old son for Christmas. I was skeptical that these could be better than the Legos that I myself grew up with, and for good reason. The magnets on Magna Tiles are, in my estimation, very weak. They just barely hold any of your building projects together and, like a house of cards, only the smallest bump will cause the whole thing to collapse. You'll spend far more time picking up the pieces than you will enjoying the final product. Forget about using the car for anything substantial; you won't be able to ""drive"" it once you build on it.More permanent building-block style toys are far better than these Magna Tiles. I would return them if I could."
4,getting better,"This volume of Samurai Executioner is a alot better than the first volume. The stories in here are pretty good. There is one that was very cool about a low ranking samurai who challenges Asa to a duel for his position, of course it gets deeper that that in lw&c fashion. The hellstick story is also real interesting. Maybe there is hope for Samurai Executioner yet."
4,First rate manga,"This 2nd volume of Samurai Executioner just got more exploitative. All three stories here feature women in various stages of dishabillement, sexual outrage and defaecation. There is some philosophical underpinning to all of these so, bear with it."
4,And So It Continues,"The saga of Asa the Samurai Executioner continues with this volume. As usual, the short stories deal with morality, violence, philosophy and justice in such a way that they will possibly make you re-examine how you view certain issues. Are all criminals ""bad""? Is ""justice"" always correct?Those who only read American comics (and there's nothing wrong with them), may not appreciate or even realize the subtlities presented here. Their loss. These are spectacular tales from the people who brought us the epic ""Lone Wolf and Cub"" saga, a storyline that influnced everyone from Quentin Tarantino to Frank Miller."
3,Missed the mark,"I usually like this kind of book. Heck I used to write witty ads as a hobby years ago, so I should have loved this book, but I am sorry these were profoundly mediocre. There are a few good ones here and there but not nearly enough."
2,They Call Me Naughty Lola,"They Call Me Naughty Lola: Personal Ads from the London Review of Books, edited by David Rose""They Call Me Naughty Lola"" was recommended to me by a friend, and I normally enjoy British humor, so I thought I'd like it. But something about the book was off for me.It just wasn't that funny.The book is nicely put together, with some footnotes for references to British pop culture, but there were some missing references. The acronym WTLM is used in almost every ad, but is never explained. The ads themselves are creative, but I wouldn't consider most of them humorous. I think this book is best in short doses; if you sat down and tried to read it straight through, as I did, the humor dies almost entirely.2/5."
3,Disappointing,"I read about this book in Entertainment magazine and purchased it right away. Unfortunately, I had misunderstood what it was about. It is a collection of personal ads that appeared in the London Review of Books; they are all written by people intentionally trying to be funny. Most of the ads are extremely self-deprecating to the point of being depressing. As someone who reads personal ads regularly to find the funny ones, I found this book disappointing. Maybe the British humor is lost on me, but I would suggest just sticking to your local personals for a real laugh."
4,What a cute coffee table book!,I absolutely adore this book. I keep it at work sometimes and read the ads to my co-workers to brighten up our day. They are absolutely hilarious! This is a really funny coffee table book - great for conversation.
3,Gets the job done,"There are pros and cons to this product:Pros-it can switch from a rocker to a roller. I was able to roll the bassinet from our bedroom to the living room without disturbing the baby. The storage underneath the bassinet also helped me to be mobile. There are a variety of entertainment objects on the mobile. My baby loves the lights and the bears.Cons-The mattress pad is thin. I padded it by placing an extra flannel bassinet sheet around it. The vibration mode is too noisy. It scared my baby when I turned it on, so I never used again after that incident. The motor on the rotating bears is also really loud. It didn't disturb the baby, but it was irritating for me and my husband to listen to when we tried to go to sleep. For some reason, the nature sounds come on when I turn on the rotating bears. I haven't had a chance to contact Kolcraft to try and fix the problem.Overall, I really like it, but be aware of the cons before you purchase it."
2,Mobile Safety Hazard,"I loved the idea of this bassinet so much. I was ready to throw it on the registry sight unseen- but of course I didn't and I am so glad I didn't. The material was soft and it looked sturdy except for the mobile. A detachable mobile? Great idea! ...not so much. I went to 3 different stores and in all three, the mobile was broken and laying inside the bassinet. My husband was with me twice, and in both cases he looked at to see why it was like that. We thought mabe it was just the display but, no, it was just broken. But it seems to attach in an odd way making it seem like all it could possibly do is spin around on the side of the bassinet. This seems very unsafe and I just thought everyone should be aware. If you like the mobile idea, Simplicity makes ones with mobiles that are not detachable, but they screw safely into the side into a permanent plastic holster and they offer more features. (like turning into a bedside sleeper for one)"
4,Perfect for a boy or a girl,"I bought this bassinet myself. My fiance and I recieved a very nice hand me down pooh bassinet but I had my heart set on this one and honestly couldn't deal with the fact that my son didn't have it. I am still 3 weeks away from my due date, however the bassinet has been up for about 2 1/2 weeks now. It was really easy to put together. I am by no means handy but there were no tools required and the directions were clear and easy to follow. It is a little heavy so I don't suggest doing what I did; assembling it in the living room so my fiance had to carry it through 3 rooms and up a flight of stairs to get it into our room. The mobile is adorable and it snaps in firmly and once the nut is screwed onto it, it will not move from possition. The matress does seem a little thin so I will most likely end up buying a second matress and using the one it came with as a bassinet matress pad instead but besides that, I love it and would recomend it whole heartedly!"
4,Great value.,"With this bassinet we got all the features we wanted at a reasonable price. The casters make it easy to move around and can be folded up for use as a cradle. However, I think it rocks too far for a newborn. The light on the mobiile is great for late night baby checks. I like how the light turns off on is own after afew minutes. I have used the nature sounds and music setting that plays classical music many times.Some things that are a bit disappointing are the battery life and the vibrate mode. The batteries don't last long when you use the sound or vibrate features. The vibrate mode is terrible. It rattles too loudly to be used. Because the vibration is coming from the mobile on the side of the bed, the vibrations under the baby are minimal. The matress is a little thin, but it works fine.But, all in all this bassinet is a great value."
3,Pretty sturdy but horrible truck mode.,"This is one of the better transformers as far as durability (there are some panels that will fall off but not many) but when you transform it into a truck it doesn't roll. the feet do not fold up high enough and drag. I wish they made these like the first generation ones though, better quality control."
3,Best of Motion Picture Scores,"If you like Shostakovich's main music, check out this sampling of his motion picture scores, his little know music. I think you will be suprisue."
2,Is this all there is?,"I joined this blog about 3 weeks ago. What is in this blog now is the same stuff that was in there when I joined. I realize that a resident's life is hectic, but if this doctor is too busy to blog at least every other day, then I am cancelling my subscription to this."
5,Can't find a better deal!,"Amazon came through again with a great deal. Their price on Lenox Federal Platinum may not be the absolute lowest to be found, but with free, fast shipping and their 4 for 3 Promotion, the price beats any others out there. I'm very happy with my purchase and was able to get an extra serving piece for my daughter-in-law for Christmas."
2,Oh Brother!,"The operator's manual is not very well organiized. There seems to be a lot more bells and whistles than I had bargained for. All I wanted was a simple fax machine to send and recieve faxes and occasionally make a copy. I'm still reading and rereading to try to figure out how to simply operate it. Oh Brother, I'll eventually catch on, I hope."
4,Fax Machine,"I replaced my older Brother fax with this newer version. I am pleased with my purchase because this unit is much smaller, lighter and uses plain paper. It was very easy to set-up and use. I would recommend it for someone who wants a home fax machine."
5,terryjack,A really great price for a one person small business or for personal use. My order was delivered quickly and it was easy to set up and use. It's small so it doesn't take up a lot of space. A great product.
1,Worse Amazon Experience,"This is my worse purchase from Amazon.The product was delivered after a long delay. Finally when it arrived, it was in a broken box. Once I opened, it looked like a used product that was repacked to make it like new. Once I hooked it up, the fax # display sometimes shows the number and at other times the display shows partial fax numbers.I have used Brother Products before and has always been satisified with their other products/services in the past.I am totally dissatisfied with this vendor and urge all not to purchase from this vendor in future.Amazon needs better quality control when they let this sort of private sellers sell stuff on amazon."
2,"For a very limited home use its OK, but there are better for the $$$","The machine feels fragile and goes through the carbon ribbon quickly. After six months of very limited home use, I am hearing a squealing-grinding noise when feeding the fax for a send... I am not sure that the unit will make it a full year. I regret buying it. There are better machines out their for the same money... find one with a refillable cartridge. Conditionally Recommended"
2,Damaged Box,vendor for this product did a poor job packaging the product. They shipped the original box which was thin and when I got ti there were holes in the box. It was a gift so it looked really tacky. Probably will not order from amazon again
3,You get what you pay for!,"As most persons have highlighted about this product, it does have its pros and cons, however you really get what you pay for. I thought this was a steal with the 30 rebate, however poor print quality as well as problems with the cartridge made it problematic to deal with. I finally just lay it to rest and got a efax number. This was a excellent choice for me, as I didnt have to deal with the hassles on getting a dedicated line or buying paper or toner. I just called them on the toll free number 866-944-0768. They gave me a 30 day trial to check out the service and all my faxes are converted to pdf and sent directly to my email address.My overall take if you want to try it then you can but save yoursel some headache and just go with an efax. Its easy just call them and in minutes you are setup.866-944-0768"
2,"Who manufactures this thing, Fisher Price?","I wouldn't buy this fax machine again if Brother paid ME. I have had mine for just over a year. The print quality is bad, but honestly I didn't expect it to be crystal clear considering the price. I did, however, expect it to work.This machine randomly decides when it wants to accept faxes and when it doesn't. Not recommended for a home business. Clients are unimpressed when they have to try and fax me something 12 different times because the machine is feeling temperamental.I bought a Canon fax machine instead and it works like a charm."
1,Buy Something Else,"I work from home and need to occasionally send out faxes. This machine is of such poor quality that I have to sit and help the feeder with the documents or else it would not grab them to pull them through. God forbid I ever need to receive a fax - I would have to do the same thing for the printer which is also of poor quality. My advice - spend a little bit more and get something that will be reliable, because this machine is not. I can't wait to pull an ""Office Space"" on this thing once I get a different one."
2,Get What You Pay For,"I purchased the Brother Fax-575 for small business use. I travel to local business and they sometimes do not have a fax available. This fax comes in handy because it is very lightweight and portable. I have only used it for faxing because when I try to use the copy feature the machine can only handle one page and then it starts to over-heat. The copies come out very blurry and then completely black and then the machine just shuts down. I have not had any complaints from my boss as to the quality of the faxes, however. Maybe they just haven't said anything. This fax is fine for personal or occasional faxing, but if you do more or expect quality copies invest in a better machine."
1,Do not buy this,"This machine seems like it would be perfect for home faxing. The problem is that the machine died after about 5 uses. Also when it did work, the paper did not feed one page at a time. I had to stand there and ffed each page."
1,dissappointed,It isn't working. I havent returned bcuz so busy. No one in town can fix it so instead of the hassle I will probably toss it and buy new.
4,Good item at a good price,"I needed a fax machine that was economical and could not only fax, but could copy.This is a small and easy to use machine that I highly recommend."
4,Good little machine,"So far, this inexpensive little machine has worked flawlessly. Obviously not meant for heavy duty use, it's perfect for someone needing occasional faxing service. The cartridge and ribbon system is anything but high tech but simple to replace. For the frugal types, since you only get about 150 faxes from one cartridge/ribbon, it is possible to re-roll the ribbon and reuse it a couple of times; the quality suffers a little doing this. All and all, I highly recommend this machine for a select group of users."
2,Slow as quicksand,"I suppose one shouldn't expect much given the price. But really, I bought this product because it was by Brother, as my previous experience with Brother products was very good. Aside from the terminal slowness, it is quite efficient in other areas. It seldom jams; it prints quite clearly. I understand that fax prices have gone down tremendously, and there is more variety. So if you're in the market for a small equipment of this sort, I would suggest comparison shopping the various fax options available and not get seduced by the apparent low price of this item. It might cost more in the long run, in subtle ways."
5,Brother Fax-575,"Easy to set up, just what I was looking for. Also it is simple to use . Buy many items online I wasn't disappointed."
3,COMMENT,"NOT MUCH RIBON IN IT , WAS GOOD JUST ENOUGH TO RECEIVE 12 PAGES VIA FAX.OTHER THAN THAT IT WAS A GOOD BUY"
5,Perfect to avoid spending $13 at Office Depot etc!,"I use this solely to hook up temporarily and send faxes from my house. That is MUCH more convenient than driving to Staples or wherever, and getting charged huge amounts of money for something that cost them almost nothing. This Brother is very cheap, and works perfectly for that. My rating is based on my use; I cannot comment about receiving faxes or trying to use this as a fax/phone combination."
2,Fax machine by Brother,I was disppointed to find that this machine takes a ribbon type cartridge good for approx 80 copies at $26 bucks a pop. I guess that's why the machine itself was so inexpensive.
3,Get what you pay for,"Fax machine is okay,You cannot put in more than one fax at a time to fax in paper tray,It will feed all papers atonce so you Don't know if they recieved all ore just one.When you try to fax you need to be quick during you session as to feed it one paper at a time and if you not you will start over with the next fax to be sent.I will keep it for now,But I plan on buying a diiferent machine."
3,OK for occasional use,"Decent fax machine, but seems slow on the transmission. Cheap looking, flimsy handset. Quality on my received faxes are not as good as my old machine. I don't think it's possible to chamge the resolution for the incoming faxes. Copies set on standard are very poor quality, you can change the resolution though. No speaker phone. Overall, for the price, this is an OK machine. It does the trick for the most part."
3,"Not 3 stars, more like 2 1/2...","I just bought this for 37.99 brand new, including shipping and taxes.. so for the PRICE I paid for it, I really am not too dissapointed.. It works well at SENDING faxes, the printer part of the fax is not good... It prints very poorly(in my opinion). It is LEGIBLE, but it's a really grainy printing...I sent a multiple fax, and that worked fine, so for 37 bucks, and if you dont use it on a REGULAR basis, I'd say this works, but had I known a head of time about how bad it PRINTS, I probably would have paid 30-40 bucks more for a little better one. Functionality wise, it all works fine, I'm just not crazy about how it prints.I just bought the Brother 3360C-All-In-One, its WAY better, so I suggest you get that instead."
3,Request for comment on faxing non-standard size pages,Please ignor my rating. This posting is trying to get some feedback on the user's experience.Could someone share your experience on faxing a non-standard size pages (like small sale receive)?Thanks
5,This is a cost effective unit,We had to move our all in one unit and our main internet connection to another room that did not have a telephone outlet and we needed a small stand alone unit and this did the trick. Cost effective and works perfectively well. I would recommend it.
4,Broke after 3 months,"Worked well for three months, but will no longer feed paper though it. I guess you get what you pay for.Update: I got it working again, so I guess for the price, it's not bad."
4,LB,"It's cheap,easy and does what it should. If your need is to send hard copy and receive limited pages inexpensively this is for you."
2,O.K. for a once in a while fax from home,"When I needed a fax machine I just went to Amazon, I ought to have checked the local office supply stores. They had lower prices on this item.It's O.K. for the situation where a fax is needed, certainly not for a high volume of work."
5,Great value!,"We couldn't be more pleased with this fax. It is perfect for the family that needs to send an occasional fax. We needed to send 3 or 4 a month for about 5 months and it paid for itself in in outside fax fees alone, let alone convenience. It could be expensive if you needed to receive a lot of faxes but perfect for the convenience of light duty use. It set up immediately and has worked flawlessly. In the first few weeks we have sent about 8 pages and received 2 pages without any trouble. We are absolutely thrilled."
3,Wanna buy a fax machine?,"As a standalone machine on a dedicated fax line, this machine is perfectly okay. However, on a combination line, it has difficulties. I could not get the machine to cooperate with my (separate) TAD phone, which would not cooperate with the other phones in the house. therefore, this machine is being retired and replaced with a fax/cordless phone/TAD combination unit."
5,great fax,"The fax is a small size, easy to move, simple set up, affordable price, everything works great with it. I am very pleased with my purchase."
4,Stand by,"We purchased this as kind of a back up for when and if we need a fax. Not used often, But to date, it has worked fine. Have been pleased with all purchases from Amazon, hope the service continues."
5,Great for occasional use,"I needed a fax machine I could use with my existing phone, answering machine and single phone line. This has been a great purchase. I don't receive or send many faxes, but this is fine for occasional use. This machine would probably not be the best choice if you plan on getting lots of faxes."
3,Arrived quickly and worked as promised,For my purposes this is the best fax. I don't do any heavy sending or receiving of faxes so I'm not worried about the cost of the film (which I think is way too high) but this little machine is full-featured and easy to set up. Don't get it if you're going to receive a lot of faxes because it will cost you a fortune in replacement films.
1,Review of the Brother phone/fax machine,"I assumed the phone was cordless but it isn't, and also it has a constant buzzing sound and is hard to hear. A few days after I bought it on line Office Depot had it on sale for $19.95!"
5,Great!,My father in law has this fax machine and when I found out how easy it is to use I had to have one. It was very well priced and I use it only to send out faxes and make copies. Very easy to send faxes and the copies come out excellent!
2,Great if you primarily transmit faxes,"I purchased this fax as a backup when our primary fax at work finally died. This was cheap and allowed me time to shop for a better model to replace our workhorse fax machine. We send about 15 pages per day and receive 30-40 pages per day.It would be too expensive to use this for a business or busy home office as you would be changing cartridges 1-2 times per week. But, if you are in a situation where you rarely receive faxes, just transmit, then this would be the way to go (no cartridges used for transmitting faxes).Right now this fax sits in the storeroom in case our new fax machine, which is a large Brother laser fax does all our fax work."
3,Good multi-product,"Easy to use, bought on the fly as a last minute need but had I taken more time, I would've looked for a later model for the same price. Good product nonetheless"
3,the handset is too small.,"Very good machine, but the handset is too small. I wished I had spent a little more money and got the bigger one. The over all size is smaller than most. But for the price works good."
4,Printer,I love my printer and scanner! It works great and the price was very low. It is a great item. Glad I bought it.
3,"Loud Speaker when Dialing and Ringing, can't be adjusted.","This fax machine was a great deal, $30. I'm disappointed with the volume. It is really loud and the speaker volume can't be adjusted. I have a 7 month old and I cringe when he's napping and I have to use this! I mostly use it for outgoing faxes from home, works well there."
2,FAX575 Customer Review,The set up for this product and functionality is very simple. The reason this product was returned is that the quality of print was very poor and when contacting Brothers for assistance the response was poor. The only suggestion was to spend another $20 to $25 for a cartridge and if that did not fix the problem then call them back. I was not willing to spend 1/2 again as much as the machine cost only to find out if it was the issue.
1,you get what you pay for,"I bought this at Office Depot with a rebate so I paid about 30.00. Since the beginning, the paper jams all the time and it hasn't even fed into the machine. It takes about 10 trys to finally get a copy. Faxing worked better, but sometimes that shows jamming also. I want to take it back and smash it to death on the sidewalk outside the store. I am shopping for a new copy/fax."
3,GOT WHAT I PAID FOR,Use this fax for a small home based business and it performs an adequate job. Noisy.
2,Works when it wants to,"This fax machine is very unreliable. I used it mostly for sending faxes. Sometimes the faxes would go through without a problem. But more often then not, it would give me a ""poor line condition"" error message when trying to send multiple pages. So if I needed to fax mroe than one page, I would have to fax them literally one page at a time. This is frustrating and time consuming b/c then you have to dial for each page. I would not recommend this fax machine."
4,It serves its purpose.,"Our other fax stopped working and we just wanted a reasonably priced fax only.The phone part has a cord which not crazy about. But for the price, it gives us whatwe need."
5,Perfect!,"I got this for my dad's office and he loves it! What else can I say? For $33 you get a phone, fax, copier. Well priced!"
4,Great fax machine for the money,"We actually use this machine in a business setting, and while we don't send or receive massive numbers of faxes, we have found that this machine is well up to the task. The only reason for four stars is the print is not quite as clear as could be."
4,satisfactory performance,"I seldom use this fax machine, so my review isn't weighty, but Amazon keeps asking for my review...It works fine. Setup can be a little tricky, but the manual is thorough if you have the patience to read it. Once you get the hang of the machine it works pretty good.This machine uses a roll of carbon paper, not toner or inkjet. This is an advantage if you don't use it often; the ink doesn't dry out, but the roll has to be replaced frequently if you use the machine much.I re-rolled the carbon paper and reused it once to save going to the store for another roll with minimal diminution of quality. The second time I re-rolled it, quality dropped off sharply, so now I need to get to the store.Not too shabby a machine for not too shabby a price."
3,Only Great if it is used ONLY to fax,Great fax speed and confirmation print out. Not great with copies and not great with scanning interface. It sorta sucks that it takes a ribbion and not a cartridge or toner as we are in the year 2008!
4,Does the job well for the price,"I replaced a comparable HP fax machine with this one because the HP used an expensive inkjet cartridge that dries up if you don't receive a fax or make a copy regularly. This Brother fax machine does not have this problem, the ribbon cartridge does not dry up, which is nice. Also, you can roll back the ribbon cartridge and use it again to save some money. This works fine although technically the more you use it over again, the worse quality of your incoming faxes and copies would be. The fact that I can use the cartridge more than once is a real plus since I'm very into saving money. Also, a replacement cartridge is less than $19. at the time of this review, whereas the replacement HP fax inkjet cartridge is over $30.!For a light duty home office, this fax machine gets the job done at a good price."
1,poor choice,"This machine is a poor example of fax machine its alignment is bad its copys are bad it has a ink tape which was not explained, I know this is a cheap machine but many things are inexpensive but is no excuse poor workmanship.Thank You Carl WilliamsPS This is why I am returning this product."
3,Works great but the ribbons run out quickly,"As with many printers/faxes, the cost of the actual product is low, but the real costs are with the ribbon that this device requires. After about 1 month of use with our small business, it had run out of the printing ribbon as it prints a report with every fax. Each ribbon covers an entire page and thus runs out quickly."
2,I WOULD NOT BUY ANOTHER,PROBLEMS PROBLEMS PROBLEMS JUST GAVE ME PROBLEMS WITH MY PHONE AND ITS NOT CHEEP TO USE UNLESS YOU OWNA PAPER INK FACTORY
1,Brother Failed,"We purchased this fax machine on October 16th and it broke, simply FRIED in just over a month (outside return window) after only receiving 3 faxes! Make that 3 1/2. It appeared to die during the 4th. During that reception, it smelled kinda funny, like plastic melting, I looked at, and nothing. No power, dial tone, nothing. Purchase at your own risk. Until the inevitable end to the need for fax machines, which isn't happening quickly enough, I will be disowning Brother."
5,Great Home Fax,I have been very happy with this fax. I just needed a fax for small jobs and this works great. It's also nice because it does not take up much room on my desk.
2,Inexpensive fax,"For some reason, this fax has issues sending info. I sent a few documents and my transmission report showed the message ""poor line condition"". Don't know what that meant, it wasn't found anywhere in the manual. I called Brother and had a support technician go through the process of troubleshooting - even sent her a test fax. It went through ok but still gave same error message. She suggested it was something in my phone line and advised I call Verizon or try moving the fax to a different location (phone jack) in my home. I did so with same results. Several important faxes went through, but weren't received on the other end. It's hit or miss. I always have to call and verify if faxes are received. Frustrating...It receives faxes perfectly. Sending is an issue.Too much hassle. Should've invested more $ in another model."
2,Brother's low grade fax,It is not what I wanted from a fax machine.It took me a long time before it worked.Wouldn't recommend to a friend.
4,A Good Fax For Occasional Home Use,"This fax machine is clearly designed for occasional use. It is very good quality and easy to set up. It produces decent quality faxes, it's compact so it takes up less than a square foot. I'm pleased with it for my intended use. It's my opinion that this would not hold up to daily use in a home office. But I think it's a great machine and a good buy. I paid $37.00 with shipping through J & R. It was delivered to my door 2 days after I ordered. Great service from J & R. The only complaint I have is the display. It is very small and difficult to see. An led to illuminate it would have been a good idea. When it's out of warranty I'll install one myself. I would definitely recommend it, for the occasional user."
3,Too Floral of a Scent For My Taste,"The scent was not what I expected after reading the description of it. Said it was made with Florida orange oil and grapefruit seed extract, so I thought it would have a citrus scent. However, when I used it, the scent was a very strong floral one. I don't hate floral scents, but this floral scent was not pleasant to my nose. It was very strong and not subtle or unique. It was like a cheap air freshener floral scent. Unfortunately, I do not live near a retail store that sells Molton Brown products so I did not have the opportunity to smell the sample before purchasing it. I bought Naran Ji Fine solely based on the overwhelming high reviews from various websites and for it being their number one seller. Having said all of this, the scent does last a long time and if you like a strong floral scent, you may like it, but it was not the right scent for me."
3,Great product - defective packaging,Absolutely love the smell of this stuff -- the huge drawback is that the pump doesn't work at all (i should have suspected something since it was 'wet' in the shipping package.
5,Returned for more,We have purchased this product before from the Molton Brown store in NYC. We like this hand wash soap and so do the guests. What more can we say! It is easier to buy online and the price is right.
5,Fun AND Effective!,"I LOVE using this product! Every time I use it it's like my own facial-- it feels amazing. This product delivers results almost instantly and leaves my skin feeling soft, silky, and renewed. A great product to add to your weekly skincare routine."
3,You have to be in to this,This book is not for everyone. You have to be into researching shamanism to appreciate it.
2,PCM Stereo Sound is too bad,"The video footage is ok although the cuts between the different sets are too rough. You don`t get the impression to be on one concert you will think this is more a DVD with Hector`s music videos all lined up. But the worst think is the sound. No Bass at all. I got a 5.1 sourround system but the PCM Stereo sound on this DVD is too bad. When you have an old TV and the complete sound comes out of it, you may don`t have a problem with the sound. But I do! How can someone who owns millions and gives an expensiv concert, release the DVD in such a horrible sound? Wisin y Yandel released their tomando control Live DVD in 5.1 sound."
4,Muy bueno - Lo Recomiendo,"Esta muy bien, hay bastantes featurings: Wisin & Yandel, Zion, Yowel & Randy, Yomo, Polaco entre otros. Muy recomendado. Vale la pena. Aunque el escenario del concierto anterior fue mejor, este lo supero por los featuring. Vale la pena señalar que el Cuarto Bate se equivoca cuando comienza su canción, pero no se nota. Extañe algunos de los otros cantantes de Golds Star como Ariel el Puro y creo que pudo ser un poco más Largo."
4,Fram PH3980 oil filter,"I've always liked Fram filters, I just don't know if their oil filters are as good as they once were. Meets specs. and minimal requirements. OK."
4,A good read!,"A short, fun read for young science fiction lovers. In alternating chapters, we join 12 year old Jack and the Lustairians before, during and after their meeting."
4,The introduction and notes are most interesting,"This was the last book I chose to go with my Jane Austen ""collection"" and I found it very good. Some of the early writing is absolutely hilarious. The introduction has a more modern slant and the notes were very helpful to understanding even though many were obvious if you have read other books of this sort."
2,Misleading publication of Austen's Juvenilia,"I don't know what I expected. Fragments, early drafts, some small pieces too short to publish as a single book? What I got was Austen's juvenilia.Nothing against Austen. All authors have juvenilia. They had to learn and grow. And those writings can be interesting. Austen's are full of humor and satire. But they are best in small doses. If I were teaching a class on Austen, I'd assign 3 or 4 of these pieces. But as a whole book, it gets tiresome.However, I do have a problem with Oxford World's Classic not clearly labelling this on the cover as ""Juvenilia."" In fact, no where in the product description on this webpage do I see the word ""juvenilia."" Yes, I still would've bought it. Most admirers of Austen probably would have still bought it. But there's the sense that they were trying to pass off one thing as something else. And I fell for it."
2,Cheap,"Cheap, non wicking. It's simply a cap with air holes; almost meaningless. SInce it's too big (OSFA) it's floppy; looks ridiculous. If you've got a big head & lots of hair maybe you can wear ity under a helmet."
1,Unacceptable for road bikes,"Caution, be aware this product requires you to REPLACE the skewer with their cheap supplied skewer. If you have invested in all high end components, this is not acceptable. Otherwise, you will be completely rebuilding your ride between indoor and outdoor (better not hope you get invited to a group ride the same day your bike is mounted on this piece of crap). Look for equipment that is more flexible in adjustment so that you truly have a quick in and out of the trainer."
4,Good workout for reasonable price,I just finished my first ride on my mag trainer. This is my first trainer and it gave me a decent workout for the hour I rode it. The only negative that I have is the noise. This being my first trainer I have nothing to compare the noise to.
4,Cycle Ops MAG trainer,I wasn't sure what to expect because I had never ridden a trainer. This is a perfect match for what I was looking for. It is loud but not too loud. It offers variable resistance and can be changed with bike gears. Overall I am happy with it and would purchase it again.
4,Decent Bike Trainer,"I have never owned a bike trainer before, so I don't know how this product compares with other products.As far as the performance of this product goes, I have only used it twice and it works like a charm! An employee at a cycling shop told me that these bike trainers are louder with mountain bikes than with road bikes. I have been using my trainer with a mountain bike, and I noticed that if the gears are turned down to a lower level, it is not as loud. I have been able to use this item just fine without a block for the front wheel or a mat underneath the trainer.As far as assembly goes, the directions were a little unclear. However, for the most part, the trainer itself is intuitive to use.I would recommend this product to a friend or family member."
4,great equipment,Loved how easy it was to put together and how easy it is to use but it is very loud. I live in an apartment and feel bad every time I use it.
2,can not put trainer together,i bought this product for my daughter for Christmas. she is having trouble putting it together. she says one of the screws will not fit in the hole it is supposed to go in. so she still has not had a chance to use this product. has anyone else had this problem?
3,CycleOps Mag Trainer,I bought this and ended up returning it and buying the Fluid 2. The trainer served it's purpose. I bought the product for fitness - not training for anyting in particular. It created all the resistance I needed but I live in an apartment and the Mag trainer was entirely too loud. A workout is just not enjoyable when it sounds like you are in a wind tunnel. Definately glad I returned it and got the Fluid 2... world of difference!
4,Great Product,"This indoor bicycle trainer enabled me to convert a bike that I no longer used into an exercise bike that I use often. It is very well made, works smoothly, and is pretty quiet. It is very stable, and I feel comfortable getting on and off, as well as when I'm riding. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it was difficult to assemble because the instructions were not clear. But once that was done, it has worked very well."
4,Good Entry Level Trainer,I was looking for a good entry level trainer for my bike. I looked at others that were lower cost but their reviews changed my mind. The trainer arrived as quoted. The unit is built solid and is easy to setup. The unit provides adequate resistance for most users just getting into a training program. I feel the price could be a little more competitive but overall it's a good buy. I would recommend it.
4,it's no secret...,"If you're a fan and don't own these CD's already, this is a great buy. Those who are expecting a box set with anything extra will be disappointed. This is strictly for those who recognize the Airplane as one of the seminal groups of the 60's and wish to enjoy their golden era."
3,Definitely passionate...,"I'm a bit of a sucker for true stories, so I was interested in reading `Passion v Arrogance: A Dana and Goliath story of Wine, Women and Wrong'.Margaret and her partner operated a small winery that went `sour'after mismanagement of their financial affairs by their banking institution. This book tells the story of the struggles the owners faced through trying to do what was right in the face of incompetent handling of their financial affairs from various outside sources.I enjoyed reading the beginning of this book but feel that the later part of it could have been improved by summarizing some of the details regarding the discussions between the financial institutions and the owners of the winery.Passions v Arrogance would appeal to those of you interested in women's issues, small business management (especially the financial aspects of this if you are in America), and also those of you interested in the basic human need in most of us of wanting to see the right thing done"
5,superb insight into moon,"I found this book a lengthy but rewarding read. Wonderfully anecdotal yet surprisingly factual, dispelling many myths. I felt the book suffered a little from borderline, repetitious ""idol-worshiping"" by the author, but the depth of research makes up for any excess passion displayed by the author. Tony Fletcher is commended for the sympathetic way he dealt with the ongoing torment bestowed on Keith Moon's long suffering female partners, never glorifying domestic violence. Well worth the price, whatever it may be."
3,All Sides of the Moon,"An exhaustive biography, complete with amateur psychoanalysis, this book contains all you ever wanted to know about uberDrummer Keith Moon - and then some.Dougal Butler's ""Full Moon"" is a more entertaining (and much lighter) read, but this is a good follow-up. If you're looking for jolly stories of Moon's legendary pub-crawling and hotel-trashing adventures, go for the Butler book if you can find it. If you want a serious biography, get this one. I read it cover to cover - I bet 80% of buyers put it down before they're done.This book sent me back to the CD shelves repeatedly to refer to Moon's actual drumming while reading Fletcher's descriptions.Lots of good pictures; generally well-written."
3,It's Hard to Say,"It's hard to say as the cake that was to be made in this pan did not turn out right. The instructions were a bit off, and the cake was one big mess. I am certain that it was not the pan, but a recipe that should not have been put on line. Nevertheless, I am more than satisfied with the product, and will be putting it to use really soon. Thank you, and have a great day."
4,Disney classics,"I bought this DVD for ""The Little House""...the best cartoon on the disc. Worth the price for this cartoon alone. Sterling Holloway's narration always takes me back to my childhood."
5,"Great tale, great characters, imaginative happenings!","As the characters evolve, and the plot thickens, California Ghosting creates an entirely enchanting environment for a who-dunnit. Point Reyes has been thoroughly researched and times gone by have been totally recreated in the now. The ghostal characters can be vividly imagined, due to the extensive descriptions of each individual personna and their lively intereactions not only the living, but with each other as well. Mix these ingredients with a dash of romance amongst the living, a sense of humor, and supsense, and there exists a novel that will keep you reading."
5,Interesting and full of suspense,Have already read the book twice and recommend it for readers of all ages. Mr. Hill has a command of the English language and has an exciting writing style.
4,Simply Great. It will be a tough wait to the next offering,"California Ghosting is a fitting continuation in Mr. Hills supernatural genre. So far the trio I've read keep me on the lookout for the next William Hill release. Dawn of the Vampire, Vampires Kiss, California Ghosting. Vampire Hunters is next on my list, Mr. Hill will have to write fast to have the next book available before I have finish it."
5,"Great tale, great characters, imaginative happenings!","As the characters evolve, and the plot thickens, California Ghosting creates an entirely enchanting evironment for a who-dunit.

3,Not bad,"Good video, I am a big fan of Hogan since the very beginning, unfortunatly I think the video could have included some more fights against more exciting opponents like the Macho Man, The Undertaker etc...but if you are a big fan you've probably seen them all but what about people who might want to learn about the Hulkster! Please could someone produce a video covering his whole career."
3,A compilation of the Hulkster's best televised matches,"This is a tape that reviews Hulk Hogan in the wrestling ring in 1990-1992. He takes on fellow WWF superstars such as Mr. Perfect, Ted Dibiase, and others. Also in an exclusive tag team match, then WWF Champion-Hulk Hogan and then WWF Intercontinental Champion-Rowdy Roddy Piper take on Ric Flair and Sid Justice. If you watch both WWF and WCW these days, you'll find the tag team match both interesting and entertaining. Since this video was released in 1992, it is not quite a top priority in any wrestling fans want list. But, if you are a loyal Hulk Hogan fan, it is a must have for your wrestling video collection."
4,"Good video, but needs more.","First off, if someone wants to cover Hogan's best matches it would take a four video set. For a single video this is not bad, I do not agree with all the match choices, but this is a pretty good video. I would suggest this to any youngsters who only know the ""Hollywood Hogan"" character. This video shows how I and all the other Hulkamanics think of the Hulkster..."
3,adobe couldve done better,as someone who is overly familiar with photoshop and fairly new to online design i learned some of the basics of web design techniques from this book - it was a very easy read but there couldve been a little more detail on some of the techniques used - considering this is a book with the name adobe on the cover i expected more - if you have never used photoshop or any adobe products i would shy away from this book - i bought this book in the store for the full price of 40- and i dont think it was worth it - i would loan it to a friend if they were looking for a specific technique and were familiar with the program already but i would not tell them to buy it
4,Too Little Too Much,"Why is it too little too much? First of all for a beginner, you should forget it and DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. This book will treat you as an intermidiate advance user of Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. So you will not learn step-by-step short cut. This book is good for giving a general idea on web design using Adobe products. Thus if your Adobe software can't do a certain thing like creating HTML table, the author will teach you in using Notepad Editor instead of Adobe Pagemill. What I like about this book is, its design will help advance users of Adobe Photoshop to make it as a reference in designing a web page. For the advance user who never learn about web limitation also will learn a great deal of knowledge from this book. What I would suggest to the author for the second edition of this book is to add an ""INDEX"" and also incorporating more sharewares like Microsoft Gif Animators, LviewPro (for capturing the screen), and others."
2,Not for Beginners,"Although this book is beautifully illustrated and gives somewhat good examples and tutorials, I would not recommend it for beginners.Experience with Illustrator 7.0 and Photoshop 4.0 is (to be realistic) REQUIREDIt barely touches on important subjects and leaves you with a feeling of that for the money you paid for this book, you must have accidentally skipped a page or two.Better off buying Adobe Web Publishing and Design Unleashed."
2,Beginners only,"I've bought many web design books with one goal in mind: to master the art and science of web design. This book was a big disappointment on the technical side (not to mention trite design). I highly recommend Lynda Weinmann's books; ""Deconstructing the Web"" for a start."
3,Buyer Beware,"I read this book to and from work in the subway and to to be honest, knowing the basics of photoshop and illustrator is a must BEFORE you buy this book. If you think that you'll be up and running with the best web page in the world after reading this book, think again. If you have experience with ps and ai, then by all means get this book (and hope go got what you paid for)."
3,Typos and Type Treatments Galore,"Primarily a photoshop primer, this book contains a disgraceful number of typographical errors. Sloppily produced and rushed to print, it makes one wonder if the instructions are equally error-ridden."
3,Falls short in some regards,"I would agree with some of the other reviews here. This is not a beginners book. It assumes at least an intermediate level of understanding of Photshop, Illustrator, Pagemill, to execute some of the excercises.To the books credit however, it is very nicely laid out -easy to read -in fact images guide you more than the text."
3,"Quick read, slow progress","Though this book TENDS to teach you how to achieve special effects and stuff you could do with Adobe softwares, it skips certain sections that actually help you achieve that. This book would probably tells you what are your possibilities, but you'll have to work on your part to actually get the look you want. Also, you'll have to be familiar with Photoshop and Illustrator. The CD-ROM that comes with the book is really a piece of crab, it doesn't contain what it says it does."
5,Powerful New Voice on the Music Scene!,"With her debut album, Holly Long has created a tapestry of music that reminds me of many of the top female singer/songwriters that are flourishing on the music scene today. Her music resonates with soulful introspection that makes for some beautiful listening. Highly recommended!"
2,Very small bowl,"I was expecting a much bigger bowl for $5.00. It's too small for a soup bowl, but serves well for a small dessert bowl. These bowls would be good if you have small children. They are the perfect size for children's snacks. I haven't dropped the bowl on my tile floors so I can speak to the durability of the bowl. It washes well in the dishwasher."
1,For one??!!,"I love Corelle and love the size of these bowls but assumed that for this price it was a set of 4. Very, VERY disappointed when only 1 bowl came."
5,I love these bowls!,I love these bowls! They are the perfect size for alot of things. I now have all 3 sizes and I am in heaven. I use them for cereal as well as desserts. I would definately reccommend these to anyone. I got them quickly which was wonderful.
1,un- happy,The sword was well packed for shipping. The grip was loose and the sword was stuck in the scabberd. I thought it was rusted. To remove it I removed the grip and with a pair of pliers and hammer I was able to remove it. No rust. The blade was to wide for the scabberd and I was unable to replace it. I recommend buying a better quality sword.
4,Price War,"Our family prefers a basic paste toothpaste (over a gel or a foaming product) and this is one we regularly use. It's a great product and keeps teeth, tongue, and breath fresh and clean. I was, however, surprised at the prices of all the available toothpastes on Amazon. I am able to purchase this exact same size/flavor toothpaste at Costco, WalMart or Target for quite a bit less. I purchased it for the convenience because I knew I'd get it quickly from Amazon but will plan better and buy it locally."
4,"The Colgate Total left my teeth feeling clean, ...","The Colgate Total left my teeth feeling clean, without any leftover gritty feeling. The taste was okay, but I would have preferred a more minty taste. It's a paste and not a gel, and gels seem to me to have a better taste. However, I did like that it had a flip-top lid. With three kids, I don't have to worry about losing the top!"
4,The toothpaste had a good flavor to it ...,"The toothpaste had a good flavor to it and it kept my mouth feeling clean for a while after using it. It was a smooth feeling, not gritty like some toothpaste. I would prefer a gel, though, instead of the white paste."
4,"Our family currently uses two types of toothpaste, ...","Our family currently uses two types of toothpaste, one for gum care and one for whitening. The taste of this is better than Crest gel. I'm not sure how Colgate Total works on whitening teeth as yet. I would have to use the product longer in order to see the results. However, my teeth do seem to feel cleaner for a longer period after brushing with Colgate Total. After using the product for a longer period, say one month to give it a fair try, I probably would recommend this to family (not sure about friends -- we don't talk about teeth much)."
5,Really like this toothpaste! Great flavor and leaves ...,Really like this toothpaste! Great flavor and leaves your mouth feeling fresh and clean for a long time!
5,Michigan Memories,"Michigan Memories, grandson reads it constantly, great for Michigan fans, nice photos and interesting write-ups, glad I gave it as birthday gift"
1,Michigan Memories: Inside Bo Schembechler's Football Scrapbook,"The book is wonderful. The pictures are very good and the descriptions given by Bo make for some very good reading. This book would make a great gift for someone that loves football as Michigan football history is right at their fingertips. Be careful which vendor you choose. The one I chose sent me a book with a small tear in the cover and I was very unhappy. The book was advertised as ""new"", which was not the case. They did offer a 20% discount but that doesn't make up for the fact that the cover is damaged and was purchased as a Christmas gift. Also, it took 2 weeks to arrive and I paid for expedited shipping."
4,Mini Compress,"When it says mini, it means mini..these are tiny. They do not stay cold for long as they are so small. They would be good on a child but, if your going to use this on an adult get something bigger and thicker."
4,Edgy rock,"Robin reminds me of Melissa Etheridge. This is edgy. No screaming or yelling. I can hear everything. I think she has a classic rock/ blues sound. I just got this about an hr ago, and I'm listening to her now. Her band is good. I would like to see her live."
2,paint 'n' swirl,"I purchased this item for my child's birthday party (carnival theme). Imagine my surprise when after ONE CHILD used it, the machine quit working and no one else at the party could use it. Was it fun while it lasted (for one paint picture)? Yes. Did it last long enough? NO WAY! Would I buy this product again? Absolutely not! I e-mailed the manufacturer and the e-mail address that was provided with the instructions was returned to me with a failure to deliver message attached!"
4,"An unusual mixture of power metal, death, goth, and opera","Overall it tends to sound like basic metal to me with a slight goth tinge like Lana Coil, but it has a mixture of death, ""gothish"", and opera style vocals. This band also has two vocalist, male and female like Lacuna Coil. Both of them switch back and forth within songs like Lacuna Coil also. That's where the coil similarity ends, because this band is heavier, darker, and more unique. Both handle the ""gothish"" and opera parts, while he does a couple of fleeting deathish style vocal lines, which is good imo, because I wouldn't like it if it was all cookie monster vocals. Inbetween time they handle some basic vocals. The album gets a 4 stars for being unique, along with having good musical ability, and a solid fillerless album. I took off 1 star because I don't like cookie monster vocals, even though they were fleeting. Of course that's my taste."
2,Don't bother,"I love pirate movies, even bad ones,but this collection is a waste of time...........don't bother.The Big E."
4,A very good product,A very good bowl. Perfect for salads. I only wish these bowls came in a slightly wider size.
5,Basically you're getting 75 minutes of excellence,"If you love dark, ambient music, then Lustmord is the artist for you. Aptly titled The Place Where the Black Stars Hang, this CD is one for the earphones and quiet contemplation. If you could capture with music a thought or theory that can't be readily seen or even really known, then you would have this release. Darkly haunting and one of the best ambient releases I've heard in a long time."
1,Not a pen mouse. Worse than a regular mouse.,"This is false advertising.This product is definitely not a pen mouse, the grip is awful.The buttons are positioned so badly that it's close to impossible to click.The tilt makes it inoperable.A regular mouse can function much better.I couldn't find even one good feature on this product.$35 down the drain."
1,No customer Support,I ordered this item 2 months ago and still have not received it....i have called and left 5 messages and about 20 emails now.... so far i have yet talked to anyone... i would stay away from this company
1,Broke in 1 week,I followed the product instructions and got the ePen up and running. Liked using it because it's different from other mouse designs. It stopped charging within 1 week. The manufacturer didn't respond to my calls (left messages but no reply). My email inquiry was bounced.
1,BEWARE,I bought this item from Amazon thinking I was getting pressure sentive model. They sent me the ez-529 only with cord. Apparently the ez-529 with usb cord is now the new ez-528.Amazon doesnt sell the pressure sentive pen model anymore.I went through big customer service mixup with Amazon.I dont think its Amazons fault though.Go to Ezonics and do reasearch first.They seem to have two models with EZ-528 model number and you may get wrong items.I tryed calling and email ezonics with no answers.Any company thats stupid enough to name two different models the same number and same name Epen isnt worth doing business with.
2,rip off,"I read over this item several times, and this is a total of 36 basic black bic pens. These pens sell for $1 for a pack of 10 at the grocery store at back to school, and $3 for a pack of 10 any other day. So at most, you should be paying $12 for this item, and yet it costs more than four times that amount. Either they messed up on the qty, or somebody screwed up the prices."
1,way too expensive,i assumed they would be made of gold but they weren't. way too expensive for 36 pens. these should be $10.
3,Additionally..,"The only bit of information I can give that wasn't already given in other reviews for this item is that the characters are largely Out Of Character. Duo resembles an airheaded, annoying brat (which, if watching the original series, you'll understand that he's not so bad). Trowa laughs not once, but /twice/, which is rather hard to picture in someone so stoic most of the time. Just the entire manga in general had me baffled, as it seemed what took place was highly unlikely to happen. Yes, Heero/Relena fans will love this one, if just for the ending. Those of you whom are used to the shounen-anime type art of GW should look elsewhere, this art is considerably ""fluffy"" and ""shoujo"" by all means. Poor Wufei.."
5,Gundam Wing Ground Zero,This is so cool!I read it on the internet and I had to buy it after that!If ya like Gundam Wing you should realy get this!It's awesome!!
1,Are You Kidding Me?,The price alone is enough for me to give it zero stars-$2.28 a pound? I buy it locally for 1.25 a lb and I consider that a rip off.
1,"Should have been a novel - historically, very inaccurate.","What is most disappointing is that Kent had accurate and detailed information from those of us involved in the operation. The errors are so significant, this book is worthless as a factual reference."
1,Buy Black Hawk Down instead...,"I agree with LTC Biller's assessment: this is a poorly written, often contradicting, hastily thrown together work that was obviously published to beat Mr. Bowden's book to the stores. Additionally, it seems that none of the participants that were consulted for Black Hawk Down are interviewed in this publication, and many aren't even mentioned.Also, the facts about Shughart and Gordon's last stand are entirely inaccurate. Even has who was killed first wrong--it was really Shughart who was the last man standing to defend Crash Site 2.Do yourself, the facts, and those that perished that day a favor, and purchase Mr. Bowden's excellent work instead and get the whole story, including the events leading up to and following this horrific day."
1,Somalia e la morte della Americani,"This book has too many contradictions, about the people involved. The author (a weekend warrior and an officer no doubt)misleads the reader by giving various titles and positions to people that took part in the events. For example; if CWO Durant was stripped naked of his BDU's, how was it that he was videotaped wearing his BDU Trousers and Brown Undershirt? C'mon. I was in the Army and Infantry, I don't deny the heroics that day but we should'nt have been in Somalia in the first place. If the US does return to Somalia in some trumped up excuse for finding terroists we're in for another (***) whoopin unless we go in loaded for bear."
3,Too tight!,"Nice, good quality shoe but too tight! Go bigger by a half to whole size up and it may fit you. Shame - I was really looking forward to this shoe."
4,A Worthy Introduction to African Literature,This is a great collection of stories. Too often the artistic talent in Africa is overloooked because of the turmoil in some parts of the land. This book is for anyone who wants a deeper understanding of the African people and their lives that one cannot get from headlines.
5,The plates were just what I wanted and expected!,These plates added to my place settings at a very reasonable price. I am very happy with my purchase.
4,"Good background book, out of date guidebook","I got this book and Wee Changrua/Elke Schmitz's ""Rock Climbing in Thailand"" (3rd ed, Dec 2005) guidebook. Sam's book is good in giving you background and route descriptions but it is hard sometimes to find climbs with his photos. Also some data is out of date. For example the Diamond Cave area, only 2-3 climbs go the full height of the wall to the roof but looking at Sam's book it looks like they all go to the roof. Wee's book is upto date on this. Also Wee has a new edition, availible in Railay and Tonsai with the newest info; such as Stalagasaurus losing it's defining stalactite.Otherwise it's an ok book."
2,Incomplete Guide,"Very incomplete guide, only few selected climbs in each area. If general info is what you seek, the guidebook is OK. If you need a comprehensive guide to all the climbs, it would be better to purchase guidebook locally."
2,outdated,"Everything i read said this was the book to get. however after i got to thailand and spoke with multiple climbing shops all said this book was outdated as most of the routes have been rebolted over the past 1-2 years. If youre looking for something to tell you where walls and routes are its ok, but as far as knowing where bolts/quality of bolts is id probably recommend something else. We ended up renting another book from a climbing shop."
5,Please Note!,"If like me you buy anything with Christine feehan's name on it, be advised you already have this book.THE TWILIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS is a separate book and After the Music, is a novella in A VERY GOTHIC CHRISTMAS. I bought THE WICKED AND WONDEROUS thinking it was a new magical sisters story.If you don't have those other books this one is good."
2,REPRINT,"I gave this 2 stars only because I hate feeling duped. I love Christine Feehan and purchase everything that has her name on it. This was a new cover and new name, but I already had the stories. I think this is dishonest marketing on the part of the publishers. Hopefully they will hear the cry of FOUL and market her works more honorably."
4,Good for anybody who can look past the graphics.,"I'll admit, the first time I played this game was nearly three years ago, and I'll also admit it was fun. The graphics were good, if you liked paper cutout dolls walking towards you and shooting. However, the gameplay was fantastic. It was one of the first 3D adventure/action game that I had played in my life, and it blew me away. So, if you want a good gaming experience, and can see past the early graphics, then buy this game. If you have to have good graphics in a game with a good storyline and all that jazz, then get the sequal to this game, which is one of the best there is."
5,Help For Dark Forces,"Dark Forces is one of the best games I have ever played some levels are very confusing such as Jabba's ship, the detention facility, or the research facility. The way to beat the detention facility is in the elevators. Run from the dark troopers is okay but cheats will work wonders.Lapostal-all weapons full ammo & powerups lamaxout-maxout on all items larandy-weapon super charge or ""machine gun mode"" also temporarily doubles ammunition. launlock-full inventory laredlite-freeze enemies lapogo-diable height checking.. lets you climb certain walls. lacds-map supermode ladata-coordinate informination labug-insect mode: fit into small places launlock-accessoriesmore to come. IG-88"
1,piece of cow dung,the only part of this game that is cool is the three levels of jedi knight. get jedi knight instead of this dung. the graphics stink and so does everything else(the sound's okay).
4,"Good camera, not as automatic as I'd thought","This is a good camera: takes good pictures and has huge 'viewing lenses' (or whatever those are called) that worked great for my grandmother's bad eyesight. The film is not automatically rolled neither in - when you insert the film you have to take a few pictures and make sure that the small numbers are changing, which can be pretty hard without eye glasses - nor out when there are no pictures left. At least the rolling forward between pictures is automatic."
3,good camera but only worked for a year,"I got this camera last year for camp. It worked fine. The pictures were good but not the best. The pictures i took with it; didn't look like what it looked like when i took the shot. The pictures also had red eye. I continued to use it until recently when i brought it to camp again. This time the camera skipped pictures on the roll of film, and sometimes didn't work at all even with new batteries in it. Now my camera doesn't work, and i only had it for a year. But what can you ask for when you buy a ... camera."
2,"Great beat, but you can't dance to it.","I ordered this book as a preparation for the Dantes DSST ""Fundamentals of College Algebra"" exam. There is very little material on the internet to help prepare for the exam, not nearly as much as for CLEP Exams.Upon receiving the books, I found the cover looked exactly like the picture. Inside, the pages looked like photocopies on heavy 30+lb paper. Pages look crooked and all the text is dark... some text is almost smudged. It looks like the original was typed on a typewriter.There is no ""study material"" in this book. There are 16 pages of ""About DANTES"" stuff, including the Fact Sheet for the exam. There are about a dozen practice exams (and answer sheets) for the DSST ""Fundamentals"" exam.You will definitely need additional study material for this exam. If you want practice tests only, this is a great book."
2,Rip-off drum,"For $5-$10 more than the cost of this drum, you can buy a brand new Brother HL-2070n printer, which includes not only this drum, but also:1. a new 2,000 page toner cartridge (although you have to follow instructions freely available on the Internet to keep the toner cartridge from shutting down after 1,000 pages.)2. a spare printer for free."
4,"Tried others, came back to OEM","I've got a 2 1/2 year old Brother MFC 7820N with almost 28,000 pages printed. I have tried using cheaper drums and toner and have had problems with lines on the page. Once I replaced the drum and toner with a Brother drum and toner, the lines disappeared. I tried 2 different drums and had the same problem. While the Brother drum and toner is more expensive, my output is much better."
1,Product not as advertised,The advertisement pictured a Brother brand drum unit. What I received was a generic unit. I returned the unit as it was not what was advertised. Amazon refunded the purchase price but not the shipping charge. The advertisement was misleading and I would not have ordered the toner and drum unit if they would have said it was a generic. I have had less than good experiences with toner refils and generic brands. I believe Amazon should have refunded the shipping charge.
3,Is this a new drum?,"This drum arrived with toner particles on the roller. We called to get replacement unit which also have toner particles on it. Since my drum is not working so I have to use this drum. So far, the drum is working OK. I just don't know if this was a returned item from other customer."
1,bait and switch,The advertisement pictured a Brother brand drum unit. They called me after I purchased it and said was it ok to process with a generic. I told them no and it sounded alot like bait and switch to me. Be very careful here. I have never had a prob. previously with amazon - the company was TJ Copy.
1,Ramanufactured Drum,The remanufactured unit had a gray hue to the white paper on the first print. This is a sign of the unit going bad. Not very happy with quality.
1,a business trickery,"Brother printers may be cheap, but the drum units for them are not. This is a classic business trickery. They tease you with a cheap first buy. Then you have no choice but to continue buy the expensive parts. Furthermore, the quality of the drum is not good either. The company says that one drum unit can be used for 12,000 pages assuming 5% coverage. This is not true. The drum unit replaced with the original one in my printer had problems far before printing that number of pages based on 5% coverage."
1,Disappointing Performance,"I purchased this drum unit a year ago, and installed it about six months later, when my original drum finally gave out. It's already producing terrible copies (it gets only light use) and is giving me the ""change drum soon"" message. I chose Brother brand over generic because I thought it would perform well. Now I wonder if I should just go with a cheap brand, if this is the performance I'll get from another Brother drum."
1,Does NOT work with HL5250DN,"Despite what the little ""Will This Work with Your Printer?"" program says, this drum will NOT fit in an HL5250DN and the TN580 toner cartridge will not fit in the drum assembly!"
1,Brother DR-350 Drum Unit,Wanted original equipment and was willing to pay a little more than for knock-off brand or refurbished unit.Unit arrived as stated.Installed immediately and is doing fine.Very satisfied with purchase.Thank you.
3,"Extend Toner Life (i.e, avoid getting ripped off)","The cartridge that this drum holds will refuse to let you print after a certain time, alleging that the toner life is ended.This will fly in the face of the evidence of crisp pages, with evidently a decent amount of toner left. This is not like the old days, where the pages continue to print, and the print quality degrades as toner dissipates. Nope, this is a ""We'll decide for you when you go get another cartridge"" move by the manufacturer.Countermeasures against this ploy:1. Shake cartridge, replace2. After a while, #1 won't work. Then, open cover, Options, *00, close cover2. After a while, #2 won't work. Then, get a black Sharpie and cover the laser window on the non-gear side of the cartridge.Should get you closer to getting your money's worth."
2,still get change drum message,I changed the drum but the printer still asks me to change the drum. It was a very expensive piece and it is very frustrating to still see this error message...
2,Drum With a Short Life,"The DR-350 drum that came with my original MFC Brother printer lasted about a year. I use this printer in a home office, with a moderate amount of printing. Since replacing the drum unit (twice), the life of the drum has been less than acceptable. Even with a new (not reburbished) drum, black streaks appeared on all of my printed pages. With the new drum installed, the printer unit message still indicated a new drum was needed.This drum also comes as a complete unit with the TN-350 toner. I tried that as well, with the same results, PLUS I received intermittent messages that the toner was low only a week after installation, with minimal use.Might be a drum unit problem; might be a printer problem. Either something is wrong with sensors in the printer, or the drum units are poorly constructed. Can't tell which it is, but either way, makes for poor printing quality."
2,didn't help,The drum was supposed to help the problem i was having with the printer but it didn't. I can't use the product (drum and toner)
5,It's never too early to learn manners!,I have just bought this book for my 2 year-old and she has already picked up some good habits! Sharing and saying sorry are now natural to her. The world could do with more of these good tips. Every toddler should have a copy!
5,"Harley Davidson : Long Live ""The Legend!""","I was introduced to this book by a friend who bought it as a gift for a family member. I asked to borrow it, and to my amazement I could not believe all the information and history the book contained. I immediately started searching the web for a copy. This book is a ""keeper"" for anyone who owns or has an interest in a Harley! I cant wait to see what Dieter & Oluf write about Harleys next!"
5,Way cool,"I finally broke down and bought Paint Shop Pro 8 and knew I best get me a book to help me out with it.This book is very easy to read, very easy to understand and best of all it answers your questions in terms that makes sense.I really like this book. And am glad I bought it."
5,Excellent Book,"The book is excellent. What I liked most is a practical plan for each week. If one follows that, one can gradually cultivate mindfulness, and achieve peace, harmony and joy in life."
2,My experience,This is not what I thought it would be. I thought it would be an entire CD by Caroll Roberson. I apparently did not see what it was or I never would have bought it.
4,boating the San Juan Islands,"Doug lives on the water like you and I live on the land. He knows just about every passage and rocky non-passage in the San Juans.I boat out of Cap Sante Marina, Anacortes, WA, gateway to the San Juans. So I use his book a lot.This is an informative, useful, entertaining book.I recommend it.Wayne Heinz, author of, How to Catch Salmon, Sturgeon, Lingcod, Rockfish, and Halibut Along the Pacific Coast: Fish On!"
3,McQuarrie and Atkins are more detailed.,"This book is suitable for a themodynamics course in physical chemistry, in that gives a basic thermo course without the quantum portion in it, leaving that for a separate book. This book is a long way from the mathmatic rigor found in the Atkins text. The Atkins text was famous for its detailed proofs and brilliant math, but lacks a user-friendly feel. This book was user friendly but did not give details that could lend itself further study or understanding. If you are using this text, Mcquarrie's text is dated but is a wonderful suppliment to this text, it gives more detail where needed filling in the gaps where this text generally errs toward simplicity.The best thing about this book is its simplicity and its readability. The worst thing about this book is its simplicity because it does not explain in detail why the mathmatical model is the way it is because of the physical interactions."
1,If you want to learn pchem do not use this book,"Terrible, tons of mistakes, little explanation, problems require formulas that are no where to be found, and has some obsession with monoatomic gases. Even my teacher regrets using this book and admits that there are better options."
4,Love those Sixties quotes!,"This is a great book of quotes from the 1960s, with statements from all sorts of people - musicians, politicians, writers, hippies, and many others. Most of them are very pertinent, though a few left me scratching my head. The book is divided into the topics Politics and Presidents, War and Peace, Culture, Counterculture, and finally, Protest and Social Struggle. Yet there really aren't all that many quotes for a nearly 250-page book. There are one to three quotes on each page, most of them quite short, so most pages have a lot of extra space. Added to each page are graphics suggestive of the Sixties, stuff like flowers and peace signs. Also, at the end are helpful lists of representative movies, books, and music from or about the Sixties. THE QUOTABLE SIXTIES by Rob Kirkpatrick is a great way to get a good sample of notable things said in that fascinating decade."
2,"Boring, Hard Croquet","Alas, I somehow got caught up in the vision of short-range golf in the yard when I saw these advertised, but when I got them and set them up, it turns out that Qolf is really nothing more than a sort of croquet played with golf clubs. This would not be so bad except for the very high level of skill required to actually pitch a golf ball through a 4"" hole from just about any distance, or for that matter, just to send the ball through the wicket-like lower opening.Stick with either croquet, if you want to move a ball around your yard through wickets, or dig a hole, put a coffee can in the yard and putt into it, if you want to play golf in the yard."
2,Fast and without feeling,"Hahn is a great musician, however, her first movement of Bach's second concerto is way too fast for my liking. How can I praise Hahn's performance when the tempo is too fast to show any feeling?Yes, there is no feeling in this movement. It is almost mechanical! No, I do not wish for overly poignant songs that make people cry. However, I believe Hahn's performance of this concerto is an overly excessivly rushed one.The one thing that prevents me from giving her 1 star is the fact that, while having a rocketing tempo, Hahn's playing is flawless. I have never spotted a single mistake in the recording.In conclusion, I believe that this recording of Bach's second concerto is a disaster, mostly stemming from the fact that it speeds at a blazing tempo."
2,Wait! What just happened?,"Maybe I'll catch something if I try to listen to it again. But, do I want to? Great intonation, sound and articulation, though."
1,Cold and stiff!,"I wholly concur with other reviewers: while the musicians are technically accomplished, the playing on this disc can aptly be described as rigid, stubborn, somewhat stilted and soulless. Aggressive, emphatic and overdone. Accents consistently in the wrong place. And while the playing is fast, some ensembles and orchestras can play these fast tempi without sounding so awful. Slow movements are sweet, if you like the outrageous vibrato. Not for everybody, not for HIPsters, and certainly not for me."
3,Heifetz's Tempo,"I must agree with many other reviewers that the tempo is too fast. As I get used to Heifetz's tempo, I can still enjoy this CD. But you sure have better choice. My favorate Bach interpreter is Menuhin but you must enjoy the slow movements by Heifetz."
2,Way Too Fast,"Hahn is a talented artist, by any measure. But this presentation is just way to fast in the tempo department. Bach's beautiful concertos should not leave you feeling stressed out and fretful. I would recommend Zina Schiff's CD of Bach & Vivaldi concertos for those who want to hear these concertos played as they were intended to be played.Zina Schiff - Bach & Vivaldi: Violin Concertos, Chaconne"
3,"Technically ok, but way too fast","Well wat can I say about it. Hillary Hahn is a good violist, maybe not the absolute best but certainly good enough to be a top soloist. But something did went wrong with this recording, its way to fast. And thats about everything you can say about it."
3,slightly disappointed,"Precision playing, technically superb (or superbly technical) and brisk (listen to the fast movements of all the concertos), and, yet, after listening three times to the whole CD, I was left unimpressed and slightly disappointed. The playing lacks something personal. Also, the acoustics are awful (very studio-like)...one has a feeling the music was recorded in my small kitchen. Too bad. The CD is, nonetheless, a solid addition to my collection of Bach's violin concertos."
2,Way too fast!,"I first heard this recording while listening to the radio, and was so upset by the tempi that I had to find out who the conductor was and why the normally sensitive and musically irreproachable Hilary Hahn was playing so breathlessly fast. When I found out it was the LA Chamber Orchestra, with Jeffrey Kahane conducting, it all came clear...Kahane is a noted speed burner, whose interpretations are often rushed and frantic. I cannot believe that these tempi were Hahn's choice...another reviewer astutely commented that it sounded like the LACO was rushing and Hahn was trying to slow them down. Let's hope Hilary records these pieces at a later date with a more sensitive accompanist."
3,Despite the superior sound....,"Despite the superior sound quality delivered by the SACD technology, I found the outer movements of the violin concerti too fast, almost to the point of sounding frantic, resulting in the loss of the graciousness delivered by the better controlled middle movements. This is proof that because someone CAN play this music this fast does not mean it is desirable to do so. The BWV 1060 oboe/violin concerto was much better. The red book realization which allows this hybrid disc to be played on standard CD players sounded a bit too dry to my ears and could have profitted by a little electronic room enhancement in the absence of a more spacious natural recording acoustic."
3,I've had better...,"It doesn't matter if the concerti are played fast but I don't find this recording particularly exciting and enchanting. While I adore Hilary Hahn and many of her recordings but this one is not in my collection. After hearing it on the radio, I am glad I didn't waste my money on this one. If you want an awesome Bach concerti recording, buy the Andrew Manze recording. Manze plays it fast with many ornaments. The interpretation is superb and unique. The phrasing is very baroque but lively. He expanded romanticism and musicianship to the maximum within the structural beauty of baroque music. Bach doesn't get better than Manze's recording of these concerti. The Manze recording is a knock out as he plays like a rock star!!!"
4,very beautiful,"If you are looking for a beautiful easy to listen to performance of bach this is a great recording. If you are looking for a recording of a performer who pays attention to performance practice of baroque era music you will be disappointed. Vibrato is used throughout and the ornamentation leaves something to be desired. All said though, this is a beautiful recording that I enjoy even though I know that it is not as Bach would have wanted it played."
2,Slow down and relax please,"I am quite sure that Hilary has the technique to play any piece every written for violin, however what is required for Bach is a sense of phrasing and nuance that I am not hearing on this recording. The fast movements are too fast and feel mechanical. I would be curious to hear her play these pieces again when she is older and has a few more life experiences to reflect in her music."
2,A Misstep,"I have loved every previous Hilary Hahn recording, and given them all 5 stars. This one is a distinct misstep. It is just too fast. I felt like punching my cd player to slow it down! The playing is brittle, lacking in character (except for one of ths slow movements), and wholly without interest. Had I heard this recording blind, I never would have thought this was Hilary Hahn. Such a shame."
1,unbreakable???,i am using corelle plates and was satisfied in fact last week i ordered 2 boxes of 20-pc dinner set. i also bought this 1 quart serving bowl. while i was washing it i accidentally dropped it and it broke into small pieces...???
4,all purpose,"these are nice all-purpose bowls. they're durable and plain looking. they could be used as a small-ish serving bowl or an eat-right-out-of-bowl (cereal, soup, etc.) they're a little shallow for my personal taste with low walls. most importantly, they help you avoid plastic which leeches chemicals into food."
4,Disney Memories,"I bought this DVD to add to Volumes 2 and 4 of the set already owned and because of the selection of cartoons offered for viewing. Two of the five animated shorts on this DVD have particular sentimental meaning for me: Tiger Trouble and Johnny Appleseed. Both of these cartoons hold fond memories from a childhood spent watching Walt Disney on t.v., both in black & white and in color, and then being able to periodically share some of those special cartoons with my own children. Now that I'm the grandmother of 4 beautiful little girls, the collection of ""Walt Disney's It's a Small World of Fun Vol. 2, 3, & 4"" is providing me with a wonderful opportunity to pass these treasures on to another generation. Considering that so many of today's animated t.v. shows and feature films are designed around toys, violence and overly adult themes, I'm grateful to the Disney organization for giving me the chance to share some of the magic moments from my childhood with my grandchildren."
2,Duplication,"This has more duplication! No, I am not talking about the treasures, I'm talking about Classic Cartoon Favorites! ""Hello Aloha"" is on ""Extreme Adventure Fun""! ""Pueblo Pluto"" is on ""Best Pals: Mickey & Pluto""! Sheesh! I gave this 2 stars because of ""Alpine Climbers"". One of my faves! However, -2 shorts means less time of new shorts ( as if it were not short enough, rougly an hour). Grrrr! Please stop this madness, Uncle Walt!"
3,Not horrible but not great,"It seems as though the author went on wikipedia for the background research for this book. No new and fresh perspective was brought to the characters, it is pretty much like every other book I have read about Katherine Howard, just not as entertaining.I would suggest reading 'A Rose Without A Thorn' instead of this book. And for better historical facts David Starkey's 'Six Wives of Henry VIII'."
1,Wish I could give it zero stars.,"This book is too choppy, unstructured, and an incredible bore. Allison Wier writes better novels on Henry VIII's wives."
5,LOVE IT!!!!,"I love this set and amazon had some pieces of the set cheaper then anywhere else i looked. i received the creamer and sugar bowl within a couple days (and with free shipping at the time). its a timeless set that is easy to match with any fun accent or holiday pieces. i was surprised at how big this piece is, so it'll work well for the holidays. i couldnt find any flaws in the platinum bands or in the china itself. i cant say enough about how much i like the set."
1,Unexpected,This book was not what I expected. It didn't help me at all to get ready for the compass test for college. I was very disappointed.
3,Could be better,"This game has its ups and downs. The ups are you get to buy things for your podracer to increase speed, turning, etc., and you can switch podracers in the middle of a game. The downs are it can be really slow and the graphics can get really choppy on the slower computers. Also, all of the really good stuff comes after tempting things that seem like a really big help but cost alot, so you never have enough money. Overall, it's a pretty good game, but the downs got it too three stars."
5,Beware modern mac users!,SWE1R for Mac is NOT capatible with iMac's Lion Operating system. Shame because this is a GREAT game on N64 and PC.
1,Colored hair a bluish tint,"I have used the Crew Classic Gray Shampoo for years. The shampoo in my last bottles is a very deep purple. Over time (about 4 months I would guess)my hair has taken on a bluish tint. The person cutting my hair noticed first (I get my hair cut about once a month). Then my wife noticed. The bluish tint began so slowly, I really didn't notice, much to my chagrin and self admonishment. But, when called to my attention, my hair clearly had the faint bluish tint. I have now changed shampoos after years of Crew use. I suspect it is something in the formula that was changed over the last year or so. I, of course, don't know for sure, but the color of the shampoo and the fact it was first noticed by the person who has been cutting my hair for years, leads me to this conclusion.David T."
3,Did I get a bad bottle?,"I've been using American Crew Classic Gray shampoo off and on for several years. My current bottle seems to have changed the color of my hair from its usual semi-silver to an almost blue-gray. I had noticed that my hair seemed to be darkening some but the other day my wife said that it appeared to have taken on a blue hue. It's more noticeable in the sunlight. The shampoo itself is normally a deep, dark purple but I never considered the possibility that it would turn my hair blue. My daughter, a hair dresser who gave me my first bottle, said I should continue to use it, but not exclusively. She suggests every third or fourth washing. I'll finish off this bottle and alternate with another shampoo and see how it works out."
2,Poor Results,"I purchased this shampoo based on good reviews however, I have been using it for a couple of weeks now and I've noticed my hair has gone very dry and wirey but extremely dull. Although not the most expensive on the market but still dear enough and in my opinion, it cetainly has not met with my expectations for what's supposed to be, a quality shampoo. Sorry but won't be using it again what a waste.American Crew Classic Gray Shampoo, 8.45 oz"
4,Good Shampoo,"I am not one to color my hair. I have earned every gray hair. The shampoo was fine for cleaning hair, but I'm not sure how much darkening took place."
4,The Color of Secrets,As a grandmother I shared this book with my two year old grandchild and was surprised at how well she understood the message. The use of color to describe good and bad feelings is a brilliant approach to instructing children of all ages. [...] This book belongs wherever children live and learn. Shelby Gengo
3,Stress Relief with a Visit to New England,"I was a little disappointed when I viewed this video. The sound quality is not the best. The music and the sound of the crashing waves at the beginning of the video keep fading in and out. Also, a lot of the scenes throughout the video appear fuzzy. This may be intentional. Perhaps the producers were trying to give it a ""dream like"" quality. Otherwise, the scenery is lovely and the music is just the right tempo for relaxing. I give this video three stars."
1,Stay Away,"I am very disappointed with the quality of this knife, especially since it is manufactured by Buck.I find that the safety will not stay latched unless you tighten the pivot screw so much that it impedes the assisted opening action. The liner lock is almost impossible to push back into place to close the knife... this leads to a very sore thumb. Finally, the all-metal handle is slippery in your hand.I decided to take advantage of Buck's Forever Warranty, and sent it back complaining about the safety latch. All they did was tighten the pivot screw and grease it up... quite useless. I would advise against purchasing this, or any assisted opening knives from Buck. I guess its just not their specialty."
5,Great Mitt!!!,"Bought this as a baby present for my best friend, he broke down in tears upon birth of his son and receipt of this mitt as gift. Good quality as well. Tempered with tears."
2,INDIANA JONES WITH A TWIST,"This is an interesting story that is full of action with an endless bag of tricks, literally. Jubei is a smart mouth treasure hunter who seems to get the job done no matter what. At the same time he will accept any job no matter good or bad as well. What's interesting about Treasure Hunter is that Jubei is neither good nor bad-he simply does his duty. Treasure Hunter is a comedic adventure that's great for all of you SINBAD and CONAN fans."
3,I'm not so sure about this!,"I have quite a few of the Dummies books and am now getting a bit tired of the wit for the sake of wit - the book could have been slimmer, and easier to get through, if they left out the puns. Titles like: ""Ladies and gentlemen set your sites!"", while amusing does not really help when you're flicking through the book trying to find sections to use with your web site ""Creating a site"" would have been more useful. Don't get me wrong, I have enjoyed the Photoshop books but this one seemed to hit a nerve. I also thought that it would have been better with a few more illustrations as there was far too much text to illustration ratio (the Peachpit Press books seem to have a good balance). I also found quite a few mistakes and wrote to Dummies about it. Definately not as clear as the usual Dummie books. Lastly, they show how to add a Quick Time file but not FLASH (which uses far less space on your site)."
3,Not Delta as listed. Label is Laserlight,"Performance......3 starsQuality of sound......3 starsValue................4 stars...If you can buy it used at the right price, is is a decent value if you are not fussy or are playing it in a noisy car.In other words, typical Laserlight.The listing shows the label as Delta. It is not. It is Laserlight."
4,Great for holding ice,"The ice bucket is great for holding ice & keeping it cold. However, although it doesn't affect the performance, the outside trim is cheaply made. It would also have been nice if ice tongs were included or were an additional accessory to order with the bucket."
3,Decent Book,"I, for one, was not a huge fan of this book. I had to use this book in an undergraduate class for thermo-fluid design. This book is great when used along with a program such as MATLAB. I was hoping for more of a theoretical book with detailed examples of equations."
3,Good content,"The content in this book is good. Although the paperback version is so poorly constructed that pages will start falling out after a week and the photocopied figures are so poorly printed that it will give anyone with 20/20 vision a headache, making this book it frustrating to use."
1,Not endorsed by Allison DuBois,"If you're thinking of buying this book, keep in mind that the author does not have the endorsement of the psychic Allison DuBois, the real-life individual that the show Medium is based on. Mrs. DuBois is an author herself, and if you want the more accurate story, you should always seek out the source.This books appears to be an attempt to cash in on the popularity of the hit TV show. Don't be fooled.T. Contento"
4,Communication,"This book is certainly more readable than his last and gives us good, clear information; it's worth it's price. As to the controversy, having looked at both Allison's ""Editorial"" and Gary's ""TRUTH"" it seeems we have a simple case of unrealistic expectations and mis-communication.I believe it is not appropriate for these folks to be airing their differences in public. As a medium, myself, doing this is difficult enough what with attacks from religious conservatives on one hand and smug cynics on the other. I suggest everyone needs to take a breath here. The book is quite good, whatever the outcome of the debate."
1,YUK! This book sucks!!!,"This book sucks..........Schwartz is impossible to read! I tried to read The Living Energy Universe, and the Afterlife Experiments, which I could not finish....when a friend gave me the TRUTH to read I thought it would be lighter and more fun, but I was wrong, I could not finish it either. Schwartz is definitely not a writer!"
1,Let's face it...,"Let's face it...Dr. Schwartz does not have a clue about how mediumship and the paranormal really operate...if he did, he would not be so arrogant as to profess the TRUTH...he himself is not the TRUTH...."
1,Look what the cat dragged in!,"I am shocked that a University professor is writing such disgraceful comparisons about the mediums as CATS! It is demeaning, condenscending, and down right arrogant of Professor Schwartz. If what others post in their reviews is true, as it appears it is based on other website reports, then maybe someone should write about him as a DOG.Looks like the cat is out of the bag."
2,Not sure what I was expecting when I chose this book.,This book was about the scientific testing of Allison Dubois. I know it says that on the cover but it seemed more like a brag book. That's only my opinion. It might seem wonderful to someone else but came across as almost self serving to me.
1,Why no Professor Russek in the TRUTH?,"As a fan of the Living Energy Universe and the Afterlife Experiments, I was eagerly anticipating this book. I note that Professor Russek did not co-author this book with Professor Schwartz, I hope they colaborate in the future as the two of them brought balance to this subject I thought.Meanwhile, I see Professor Russek did the forward for Ms. DuBois's book."
1,The Truth About THE TRUTH ABOUT MEDIUM,"This book promises the extraordinary, including specific data from science experiments, but what we get are more anecdotes about how great Mr. Schwartz's experiments are. He features highlights of experiments with medium Allison DuBois, but Schwartz' bias in favor of his subject matter makes this book an epiphany of self-celebration. There is a fascinating section, The Monty Keen Experiment, and the results seem extremely remarkable -- why isn't it published in Science Magazine? Talk of ""Replication and Extension Reading"" is confined to Mr. Schwartz's ""Lab,"" and we're left wondering if any of Schwartz's experimental designs or raw data are being shared with other universities. Why sacrifice scientific method for sensational tidbits? Oh, yeah! The book's release coincides exactly with the new fall TV season of MEDIUM."
1,Catty Professor,"Either way you look at the evidence, his book, his website, Allison's book, her website.....it all adds up to him being a catty Professor...hsssssss...."
1,starting to see the bigger picture,"The bigger picture is starting to come to light about the controvery that seems to be surrounding this book. When I read the back cover of this book, I thought it was endorsed by James Van Praagh and John Edward. But after reading one of these reviews I checked the endorsements and sure enough, the endorsements are clones from The Afterlife Experiments! One has to wonder what the real ""truth"" is. It seems like there is a lot of lies in this book....over all i get really bad vibes about the bigger picture of what is going on...."
1,Ugh,"This was the worst book I've read in a long time. No ""truth"" was revealed in this sloppily edited (if at all) book that was obviously just written in a hurry to cash in on the show Medium's success. Confusing, poorly written text. I learned nothing. Don't waste your time or money on this one. Ugh."
1,airing on the side of non-believer,"As a fan of the show MEDIUM I picked up this book and flipped through it...I found it difficult to read....and i am concerned about all the allegations posted here....i suspect given the fabulous talents of these rare and gifted mediums that Dr. Schwartz has done something that they disapprove of. Working with sensitive people must be difficult, but writing about them as cats and comparing them to one another as he has seems very insensitive and almost cruel. If I were Ms DuBois I would be outraged that he has likened her to other mediums who are imposters."
1,Manipulative endorsements shows no real endorsement from professional peers either,"A friend recently shared with me both the Truth and The Afterlife Experiments. I at first was impressed with some of his endorsements to this book, until I looked more closely and read some of his website. Seems like he has manipulated past endorsements as though his professional peers endorse this book, that is until I compared the books! How sketchy of Schwartz who operates under the guise of the TRUTH.....and isn't interesting how he keeps harping on DuBois' having not endorsed him, when in fact he is mispresenting her as well.....I find it disgraceful and sad. I am giving this book 1 star because frankly I don't believe this man and I believe he has abused those mediums."
2,I smell a rat....,"I read the book and it was interesting, yet after viewing the larger picture, I am left with a feeling that just doesn't sit right with me. Schwartz continues to espouse that he had permission to write about Allison DuBois and the other mediums, but that is not the impression given on DuBois' site. I also note that he said he had written the forward for her book, but that is not the case with my copy(paperback), it was written by a Dr. Russek, and I found very few mentions of Schwartz. So, clearly there are discrepencies.... Schwartz should prove he had permission to write about the mediums, by producing a signed consent form, proving that they indeed signed their rights away to Schwartz. Why is he so attached to using their names? Why does he only have 2 mediums left on his website? Why does he not move on and use someone else? Maybe it is because very few mediums actually have the talent and ability of Ms. DuBois.I smell a rat."
2,Interesting but ideologically wrong-headed,"Halperin's work is essentially ideological, as I suspect he would admit. He believes first and then argues. His reading of the primary sources reflects his biases, and his arguments based on Greek vocabulary are weak and based on a lot of semantic trickery. If you are interested in sexuality in the ancient world, you have to read Halperin, but only those that start from his own ideological assumptions will be convinced he has said anything important."
4,A classic gay studies text! You must buy it.,"This book is a canonical gay studies text. Halperin is a respected academic in both the classics and gay studies. The term ""homosexuality"" was invented a little over a century ago. Thus, anything before that time has to be analyzed in perspective. Halperin looks at the classic writings of ancient Greek ""homosexuals"" and puts them into deep analysis. Halperin avoids a lot of the ""essentialist"" mistakes that John Boswell fell into with his Social Tolerance book. Dover's book has more cool photos in it, but Halperin's book is very worthwhile. It's a must-have for classics and gay readers."
1,There is a dark side,"She gives lots of warnings and teaches a Russian kind of shamanism. First of all if you were not raised in the belief system, these gods and goddesses are not going to work for you. Second she totally ignores the 75% of the material she learned that has to do with black magic. It is not that it is not there in that belief system, It is very much there! She just doesn't teach about it. And to me that is like handing someone a gun and bullets and not telling them how to load the gun. They will end up with a loaded gun eventually. so yes it is scary and I am sorry to see it published. It will cause a lot of trouble in the world."
5,Great book,The world lost a wonderful person with the passing of Sarangerel. I have been interested in Shamanic Spirituality for some time now and this was the first book I've read on the subject. Outstanding read!
3,Lot's of favor trading goin' on....,"Have you noticed that a lot of the 5 star reviews are people with their own books etc.? I'm noticing this trend on Amazon more and more. After all, if you wrote a book, wouldn't you encourage your friends to go give your book a 5 star review at Amazon? Notice the 1 star reviews seem to be from just regular people who just bought and read the book. I'm not saying it's wrong for people to trade favors - you know, you write a 5 star review for my book and I'll do the same for you, just be aware it's happening."
4,Good book,"This is a very good book. It explains how to get what you want by breaking down the process on three steps:1) Clarifying what you DO want, putting it into words2) Letting the Universe know what you want by creating a desire statement3) Allowing yourself to receive what you wantThis is definitely something one should read, although everything written in this book is a common sense for any spiritual person. What makes this book useful is that it forces you to use something you already know. Everyone already has this information but it is in our unconscious. The book kind of helps you to make it conscious"
5,The Law of Attraction,"Law of Attraction: The Science of Attracting of More of What You Want and Less of What You Don't WantI LOVE this book. It is easy to read, direct and to the point, and gives you exercises to do, to create what you want. I've been recommending it to my friends. I totally love this book."
4,Easy reading,"Over all, I liked his style of writing. He breaks the theory down in a way that is, not only understandable, but can be applied in every day situations. (I recommend watching the DVD ""The Secret"" first.)"
2,It was just ok.,I thought this book was not the best. Through reading it I found alot of it in disbelief. Some people may like while others will despise it and think it was a waste of their time.
5,Law Attraction book by Michael Losier,I am writing to notify that this is an awesome book! It is like a blueprint for success! I will definitely use these strategies towards planned goals by applying them at best! Will keep Mr. Losier posted! Thank You in advance!Have a blessed day!
5,Amazing !,"I did quite a bit of research on the Law of Attraction and this book was the only one that had a hands-on approach. Not just telling you about it but also showing you how to actually use it. It opened mine and my family's eyes as to why things happen like they have and to take an even closer look at the Universe. With the small amount of time since I have purchased the book , I have had a lot of interesting things happen. A few good and bad. Just keeps you guessing. . ."
3,Very positive,Thinking positive thoughts and having positive things happen to you is what this book is all about. Losier has aids in building a positive mindset that will help you in every aspect of life.good things happen to good people.
1,Absolute waste of time and money,This is a very poor copy of someone else's idea. Poorly written and usless. I tossed it. Absolute junk!
4,Simple & to the point,Michael Losier does a great job of simplifying the Law of Attraction. It's a simple and quick read which is great seeing how you may want to put the principles into action rather quickly as opposed to get caught up in the theory. I also like the way in which he mentions the various references he felt were helpful in his learning and understanding of the Laws of Attraction.
3,"You Can't Always Get What You Want...But If You Try Sometimes, You Get What You Need","Hey, who would have given the Rolling Stones credit for singing about the Law of Attraction!I am a big believer that Spiritual books have to have practical application or they are worthless. The Law of Attraction has been around in different forms longer than the author acknowledges in his ""Brief History of the Law of Attraction"", but in any form it is good to know.The good news is the author makes it easy to understand and simple to apply to everyday life. He makes it clear that you need to change your perspective to change your vibration. The bad news is that if you think you're going to be able to win the lottery or get every materialistic item on your ""desire"" list, you are sorely mistaken.To find out why it won't work in those situations, you need to dig deeper, because there is more to this than what's in the book. For those that want to move forward in their Spiritual advancement, that is the next step"
4,"Simple, easy to follow and effective","I've read all there is to know about the law of attraction and this book offers some simple yet very effective ways of applying this law in your life.I particularly liked the exercises throughout the book and how simple they all were.I've heard many stories about people applying these exercises in their life and achieving quick results, so really there is nothing to lose by giving it a go!"
3,Simple to follow,Book is easy to read and simple to follow. The worksheets are a bonus and make the book more useable.
2,Too basic and a lot of pages left blank for your notes,"This book is way too basic. It can be read for a day as a lot of the pages contain pointless drawings or are left blank for your notes. I found 1 or 2 things that I didn't know, so this is all I got from this book. I don't know why it has so many good reviews. But if you have already heard about the LOA, then save your time/money and look for something more in depth."
4,law of attraction,This is a good book to get started in learning about the law of attraction. This book has all the details of what you can do to become a better person and live the life you truly need to...
3,"Good, but you may need more","I love this book, and The Secret, and Charles Haanel, whom I read each week and which a lot of these types of books are based on. But some of us still have to do some internal work before we can really make the deep changes to bring the law of attraction into effect - otherwise our subconscious can still be sabotaging what we think we are attracting. That's where Olga Sheean's book really scores. It's not just about love, but how to make the fundamental changes to your programming to make the law of attraction actually work.Fit for Love: Find Your Self and Your Perfect Mate"
3,Law of Attraction,A good little read following up on Law of Attraction! Recommend for others to check out!
1,100 pages of inconsequential verbal waste.,I suggest potential buyers purchase this book online. Anyone who is familiar with this work will laugh at you if they see you in the store purchasing this book. I was embarrassed with myself after I spent 5 minutes browsing through the book in the isle at the local bookstore.
5,Fantastic book,I own this book and it is fantasticyou will be glad to have read it andstudied it. It is worth the time andmoney so I highly recommend this bookfor anyone seeking to grow and learn.
2,Plagiarized material,"The authors and/or publishers of this book didn't even bother to change the title from its original authors, Jerry & Esther Hicks. I don't understand how someone spouting spiritual teachings could be okay with stealing material. They would do well to also study the law of Karma, for even if they don't it will find them."
4,Great to have on Audio,"The written book was wonderful, so I ordered the Audio CD to listen in the car and reinforce what I learned in the book. It's great to be able to listen in the car, but I do wish that the author had narrated on the audio. The narrator is fine, but I think the reading style, emphasis and energy would have been better if the author were the one reading the book. I would also have preferred if it had tracks that match the chapter numbers or something, so that skipping to what you want would be easier. Still, it's really great to have and if you like the book then you should definitely consider the Audio CD as well, especially for reinforcement. Just having it to listen to helps to remind me of important points."
4,Contains simple solutions.,"If you have practiced positive thinking in some fashion, but you aren't sure if you are doing it right or if you should be doing something else. Here is your book! A good read, Even BETTER on CD. Listen and you will get answers to many of your questions."
3,A decent motivational book-mostly common sense,"This book is worded in an overly simple manner that makes you say ""duh"" at every turn of page. However, after afew pages of duhs, you realize, why didn't I use this today, or maybe tomorrow I should use this technique. They're all things that you should know, like think positive, or say critisism in a suggestive way rather than a degrading way etc. This does NOT teach you HOW to do those. Just tells you what to do. Get the next ""advanced"" level book to learn HOW."
5,This book delivers what it says.,"I had seen the movie ""The Secret"", and read the book of the same name by Rhonda Byrne, but did not truly understand what ""The Secret"" really meant until I read Michael Losier's book, ""Law of Attraction:The Science of Attracting More of What You Want and Less of What You Don't"".Michael Losier teaches you how to take action re: ""The Law of Attraction"".He has given the step by step process on activating the ""Law of Attraction"". How to retrain your thinking and speaking processes to eliminate the negatives we all tend to use and increase the positives that lead to success. This is a most beneficial book for anyone interested in improving their circumstances."
4,Law of Attraction,"Very good book, made me reflect on the way that I viewed many things in life. Everyone should read this book."
2,Better Than This..,"There are better law of attraction titles than this one. The book is familiar with the law of attraction and tries to come at it from a more realistic approach by trying involve a bit of realism: Science. While Science and Mystical are probably intertwined, this book does not do a great job at pointing that out. To me it's like this book states this possibly works , try it out. I felt instead of getting inspiration, I got a theory of science. Theory is good, but it's not great because it's not proven."
1,childish,"The only ""universal law"" at work here is the UNIVERSAL LAW OF HUMAN GULLIBILITY, which states: ""Whenever you tell people that they can substitute wishful thinking for real work, they'll go for it every time."" This law has been stated in the past by P.T. Barnum (""there's a sucker born every minute"") and by W.C. Fields (""you can't cheat an honest man; never give a sucker an even break or smarten up a chump."")"
1,NO GOOD,Do not waste money and time reading this book. Stuff like this ( and recently 'The Secret') there are no other thing that new ways to some 'authors' to make a lot of money based in people's ingenuousness...
1,Can't listen to this DRONING voice...,We actually don't know if this book is any good - we couldn't get past the voice of the reader.
1,From the author of Tales of Ancient Xenar,"Yes, my review here isn't for this book, but for the author and the techniques he teaches. I have read a lot of Mr. Losier's works about the law of attraction and his works detail a lot of work to make it work in your favor. He has you writing out whole lists of thing you want and don't want, these list called Clarity/Contrast lists. I frankly don't like having to write pages of lists just to make something work for me. My advice to all of you, avoid stuff by Michael Losier."
2,It's Not About You,"I have read several Law of Attraction books (including this one). All of these books have a common theme--a focus upon oneself as the source of fulfillment. Guess what? It's not about you! If you want to change what you attract, you will never succeed by looking to yourself. You must first make God the center of your universe. This is not a message that many of us want to hear or accept because our Western culture is based upon self-gratification. When you seek God and make Him the focus of your life, guess what happens? All of your needs (and more) are fulfilled. That is His promise and God never breaks His promises. If you are sincere about having a fulfilling and meaningful life, I suggest you read The Purpose Driven Life by Rick Warren."
4,work book,"Mr. Losier pretty much covers it all in this book although was not what I had in mind when purchasing, but found it to be interesting after all. I thought ""Law of Attraction"" was more in a text book setting, where ""work sheets"" are included at the end of every chapter which I thought very handy. Easy reading with cute cartoon drawings."
3,interesting but..,"The book has many half written pages as other reviewers have noticed, which makes it a quick read. Most of the ideas come from other writers, but this writer, who is also an NLP trainer, seems to concentrate mostly on rewording affirmations to make them more believable.Overall the Law of Attraction is an interesting concept but it seems to be used only to attract money, clients, a beautiful mate, etc, all kinds of egoistic wishes that are the building blocks of an extreme capitalist society. The examples given in this book and others go in that direction. Bob Proctor wrote in another book : ""why do you think that 1% of the population earns around 96% of all the money that's being earned?"". I am sure that all the readers want to be among the 1%, but is that all we are here for?Why not use the Law of Attraction to attract a better world for all?"
1,Get this free report instead,"Dr. Robert Anthony, the inspiration behind 'the secret', has a free report you can sign up for that takes deliberate creation and the law of attraction to the next level. go to [...]"
2,Intro LOA,"By the time I read this book, I had already read a half dozen LOA books so I didn't really learn much that I didn't already know. This book might be good as an introduction to LOA."
1,unattracted to the law,i found this book to be a cheap attempt to explore further the law of attraction.
1,This is not a law. This is not science.,"I can't believe people fall for this garbage. The ideas presented in this book are done so without any regard to scientific method, and ""The Law of Attraction"" is far from a law. Laws are absolute. Laws are proven. Laws are backed up by fact. Show me the proof that our bodies operate at a particular ""vibration"" and it is this vibration that either attracts or repels things in our lives. This book does not offer that proof, and neither can you. Sorry, finding a winning lottery ticket on the ground is not proof that our bodies are ""vibrating"" or that finding that ticket was based on positive thinking.Be careful of any writing that proclaims something a ""Universal Law"" that clearly isn't.Don't get me wrong, I'm a big proponent of positive thinking and I feel it is helpful. But the author is stealing your money by selling you false claims, fantasies, and untruths.Why would you spend your hard-earned money on a lie?"
2,Skip this one - there are much better books out there!,"I've been listening to this guy drone on for about the last hour and I just can't take it any more. I am listing mine right back in the Used Copies for sale section. This guy obviously likes to make lists, enjoys lists, and finds lists fascinating. I do not.He can't just make a strong point about something and move on, instead he has to support his conclusions with a detailed list of every possible thing associated with that point. I counted 17 items in mercilessly detailed list of how to train your mind to think about the LOA when he could have made the same point in a single, well-worded sentence. It's like he needed to flesh out the book so he decided to stretch out every idea to it's ultimate conclusion instead of giving you genuinely useful information and techniques. I think the LOA is fantastic, but I don't think this is a very good resource to learn about it. I just found it repetitive and annoying."
2,"Great Topic, Disappointing Treatment","I wanted to like this book. I took Michael Losier's free telecourse and had heard many good things about his seminars. But I have to agree with some of the other reviewers here. Much too simplistic and not alot of meat. I like that he didn't right a 200 page book because honestly, who has time to read that, but I think he could have given many more examples of how to work with the Law of Attraction. Specifically more concrete tips on how to deal with thoughts that are counter to your desires or intention."
5,Great Book,"This is a fantastic book. It's short sweet and to the point. It's not full of fluff, just the good stuff! This book can help you in any aspect of your life. The tools are so simple and yet so life changing. The law of attraction has already had a profound impact on my life."
2,too shallow,Interesting but I found it too shallow. I was dissapointed. It was like reading headlines only.
5,loiser,"This book was true to its reviews, very simple, sensible and consumable. A great how-to, that has to work because the self-examination instructions are so worthwhile."
3,Easy to read,"This is very simple and easy to read book - which can be both good and bad.To summarize in one sentence, this book teaches the readers how to think positively in life. We all know the importance of positive thinking - nothing new here.As some of other reviewers mentioned, this book is a great introduction for someone who have never had an exposure to NLP (Neuro-Linguistic Programming).It will be somewhat disappointing for readers with prior exposure to NLP because the book is very basic and lacks details."
3,"A nice little book, an introduction of sorts","This book is very basic, but that's what many people are looking for. I think most people would benefit more from QUANTUM SUCCESS or SECRETS OF ATTRACTION by Taylor. Those combine the energy of thought and Universal Law into one amazing connection of cause and effect. More than that, though, they really show how we tend to sabotage ourselves. When you read those two, you repeatedly get the sensation, ""Oh my God! THAT'S the reason,"" and everything becomes clear. Not only that, you get the tools to remedy the situations that are holding you back! This ""new"" wave of Law of Attraction books is okay to start with, but if you want real revelations, go to QUANTUM SUCCESS and get the whole picture!"
3,Disappointing,"I was very excited about this book when I purchased it, first from all the glowing reviews and also from a recommendation of a very good friend whom I consider an expert on books. I am disappointed with the result. The book is very thin, and it reminds me of a bound powerpoint presentation. Each simple (to me) concept is explained on several pages - to the point when I though ""ok, ok, I get it, can we move on?!"" but that could just be me. It just gave me the impression of trying to ""stretch"" the number of pages so that it's enough for it to be a book. It's not very engaging (read: on the boring side). The excercises may be helpful for ""thinking about oneself more"", but all in all, I don't believe that they can deliver the results the author is so convinced about. You know that old saying ""if something seems too good to be true..."" I wish I would have spent my money on something else."
3,Law of Attracting,"Fascinating concept and a well written book. No this isn't the ""secret"" to life as some books make out to be, but is does jolt you into thinking positive and provides the reader with practical everyday mental exercises that actually do work. To paraphrase Albert E. Every single person in the universe has one important decision to make, is my life a friend or foe."
4,Good Book!,Very Easy Read!Short and straight to the point. Written in a manner that's quick and easy to understand. The author gets straight to the point.Adds exercises as well as worksheets. There's even a website for additional worksheets.This book makes a lot of sense. What have you got to loose?
2,The audio version - don't get it - get the book instead,"I saw the reviews of the book and eagerly anticipated the audio version. I received it and was dissapointed. I have heard Michael Losier speak, and he is a wonderful speaker. The reader is boring, has no intonation, basically is monotone. It was almost like he was reading by rote. I tried to pay attention, but my mind kept drifting off. I should have bought the book. It's a ""how to"" and I think if I had gotten the book, I would have enjoyed it much more."
5,Law of Attraction,Very excited about this book...it's an affirmation of positive thinking. I have done several of the exercises in it.
3,But does it work???,"This seems to be a popular book at my library. I am currently on a long list of others waiting to get a chance to read it. I am intrigued by the high number of reviews that indicate how the author presented them with an easy-to-follow process, unlike other books on the topic of Law of Attraction. However, I haven't seen many reviews that indicate that following the process actually attracted the desire into the reader's life. Thus the 3-Stars."
1,dissappointed,"I do believe the Audio CD would have been way better if narrated by Mike Losier himself. Instead, you hear Hugh Gallager's narration which is monotone and lacking inspiration. So dissappointed in his choice of narration, I would probably reccomend buying the book instead."
5,Abundance is mine!,"I LOVE this book. I watched The Secret and flipped through book... BUT nothing beats the Law of Attraction book. Fast and easy read, plain english, makes sense, well written. BEST OF ALL: are the worksheets that he provides a link to for you to print out. PRINT OUT THE WORKSHEETS AND THE MAGIC COMES ALIVE!!! I have printed out all the worksheets and fill out the abundance worksheet every night. I've been attracting what I want ever since. Buy this book and DO the worksheets. Best book I've bought in years... money spent has come back to me ten-fold+!"
3,Create Our Own Reality?,"The basic law of attraction states that my life will become whatever I focus my energy & attention on. the focal point being the concept that the world is made up of energy that vibrates at a certain level. The old cliche that you get what you put out is the dominant theme. This universal law includes-fate, karma, luck, meant to be, serendipity, & synchronicity. Feelings of confidence, enthusiasm, love are the positives & the negatives like anger, envy, jealousy are self explanitory.The author gives a three step formula to use: identify your desire, raise your vibration, allow it to come to you. The clarity through contrast worksheet was the most helpful. Will these metaphysical tactics work? I have to try them more regularly, & overcome my skepticism to give you a definitive answer. Thus far, I would say the results have been neutral."
1,Half a Book,"This book is extremely light on content, doesn't fully explain any concepts behind the stuff the author expects you to do and leaves pretty much every other (of it's limited number of pages) blank.I have no idea why it is selling so well except that the age-old promise of ""Get Something Great (money, wealth or whatever) Without Having To Lift A Finger"" is ever appealing if unrealistic."
2,A whole book for one simple concept!,"I thought the book was way too basic. There were many exercises that you had to do and write about in the book. I thought most of it was there simply to fill up space since the main idea could be explained on one page. I am giving it two stars instead of one because after all, the author did try to write a book explaining how the Law of Attraction works. Two of my favorite books talking about the Law of Attraction are ""Ask and It Is Given"" by E. Hicks and ""How To Be Wildly Wealthy Fast"" by S. Forster."
3,Law of Attraction by Michael J. Losier,"The book gets down to the basics. His angle was nothing new to me. I was already familiar with the concept of ""law of attraction"". I expected him to go more into details rather than being so simple. However, it did marinate the same teachings in my brain a little more. It's not worth purchasing. However,you could just check it out at the library. It's a very thin book and it takes no time to read. For more insight, I'll follow-up on this subject with another book."
4,A Simple Clear Guide to Manifestation,"I really enjoyed this book because it was brief, direct, concrete and offered clear worksheets that you could personalize (for yourself or for coaching clients). I think the inner work of changing your beliefs and vibration is very important in manifestation. The one thing I would have liked included was an emphasis on action as well-ie: 'I am a famous actor AND I am actively applying for auditions.' Many Law of Attraction books seem to leave out this action part."
4,Law of Attraction,This was great information to help to more clearly understand the principles of the Law of Attraction. Especially if watching the Secret DVD left you wanting to better understand the concepts.
5,Not New Age Bunk,"Michael has given us a ""how to"" manual for using 'The Secret'. I would recommend this over the Abraham-Hicks books that some reviewers have suggested simply because this is about a universal law that works all the time. Abraham-Hicks is New Age crap based on communication I believe is from a spirit from the dark side of the universe, if it actually happened.There is nothing New Agey about the Law of Attraction. If the principles are applied they will work...they do for us on a daily basis."
4,the law of attraction,the book is very informative and easy to read it also has exercises to do to help in getting the processes started.
5,Effortless Reading,I have read several books on the subject of the law of attraction and this one by far is the best written. The author's writing style is so very easy to follow and understand. The book can easily be read in an hour or so all the while comprehending and processing his excellent advice. I highly recommend this book especially if you are just starting to investigate this idea. Mr. Losier's writing style flows so nicely and he presents ideas clearly so they are easy to understand and incorporate into life. I believe this book will give you a good foundation on which to build your own ways to attract things into your life.
4,interesting book,"The book is easy reading and I appreciate clear, concise, quickly read books. I had never really heard of the ""Law of Attraction"" until recently and it had peaked my interest so I ordered a couple of books.The book honestly has made me reconsider the things I think, say and do on a daily basis. The book has inspired me to make some positive changes. There are some things I am still considering whether or not I am in agreement with the author, however, I would still highly recommend the book to anyone interested in the subject."
1,Not much value for a business executive,The book provided a very basic lesson in common sense and positive thinking. At times the explanations were too abstract to easily translate into practical applications. Not much use for a business manager in my opinion.
5,maravilloso,"Es un libro super sencillo, muy practico y que ademas es una guia para mejorar tu vida diaria."
3,Good common sense,"I got this book because I thought it held a lot of secrets about getting what you want. Instead it all boils down to thinking positive, using positive phrasing to talk what you want helps you obtain what you want. I think it's great that it changes ppl's thought process and even helps them write a complete list of what they want and realistically how they plan to get what they have but other than that the reading was very simple. I agree with his message but it was common sense."
3,It is okay,Sometimes we think that a book will be great and it is just boring. This one is an example of it. Boring.
3,common sense,"there's not much in here which I'd consider eye-opening. it's all pretty much common sense. if you have a 'glass is half-full' outlook on life, good things happen to you."
4,Practical book,"I was very satisfied with this book. I wanted something that would practically give instruction as to how to achieve results with the law of attraction and this book is it. It doesn't get into all the philosophy of it, but there are other books that do that, which is what I wanted. Great instructional book, easy to read, and doesn't take a lot of time. I especially liked that the worksheets could be downloaded from the author's website."
3,study orchids,my familly is an orchid farm cutflower (dendrobium). and I like an orchids. now I study about orchids. I have a many orchids but I don't it name. I want it name and I study it.
3,Needs to be Made More Sturdy,"Bumblebee seems to be the most sought after autobot and my grandson was speechless when he received this. The pieces, however, come off if the toy is not transformed just right. We have given up on putting the mirrors back on; they pop off constantly. Small children should not be allowed to play with this toy because of the small parts that pop off. Overall, his enjoyment with the toy is my meter. He loves it and that is all that matters to me."
3,Decent toy,"This is marketed for 5+ years old, but can be frustrating for children under 10. The instructions are a little vague, but with enough patience you can figure out how to complete the transformation from car to figure; going back to the car is a little easier."
1,HAVEN'T PLAYED WITH IT: JUST A TIP,"I just want people to understand that I do not know about the quality of this toy, how well it plays or anything. But, I found this exact toy at toysrus.com for $11.00 USD. I was able to get it sent for $25.00 after adding giftwrap and a birthday message.Just as a heads up for consumers."
2,"This is a ""look only"" kind of toy","Transformers Movie Deluxe Class Bumblebee 2008 CamaroI did not realize how fragile this toy was. It's made of plastic and fell apart on Christmas morning!! I have to assume this is an adult collector item and is not a toy. I have to wonder though; ""Why would anyone want to collect something so cheaply made?""A real disappointment."
1,"Bumblebee Transformer DON""T WASTE YOUR $$$$, it's crap!!","I was under the impression that the price meant better quaility and durablilty, but with this product that was untrue. The simaliar bumblebee transformer was at WalMart for $10.00 that was the same quality and durability. My son recieved this toy on Christmas day, it is now the 28th of December and the head has already fallen of 5 times, the door has come off twice. WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY. THIS PRODUCT SUCKS!!!! I wish I could get my money back for this piece of CRAP!!"
3,Falls apart easily,"This transformer doesn't seem to hold up very well. Parts fall off easily and are hard to get back on, especially for little hands. Not very impressed."
4,Call me Ichabod,"I gave this to my 5-year-old nephew for his birthday. He freaked out ""the best gift ever!!! I love you Aunt Jill!"" Exactly the reaction you hope for when you give a kid a gift. Three days later my nephew called to inform me that, sadly, Bumblebee had been decapitated. But he still called it ""the best gift ever!!!"" So, I guess Bumblebee doesn't really need a head to be fun."
3,Transformers,This toy is a little advanced for a six year old. We bought it for our grandson and he is having problems manipulating and changing it from one thing to another. It looks very durable and should last him a good while. He should be able to work it as he gets older.
5,Deluxe Bumblebee is a GREAT transformer,"I got the Ultimate Bumblebee for Xmas, and since my son really liked it, I decided to get him (and me) the Deluxe Bumblebee. It is much smaller than the Ultimate BB, but I really like how it transforms from car to autobot. As much as I like the Ultimate BB and the sounds it makes, I think that if Hasbro would make the Ultimate BB more like the Deluxe version, it would be a HUGE seller. The Deluxe version is more slender, more like the Movie Bumblebee. Mind you, I have NO intention of scrapping my Ultimate! The Deluxe is a great toy for a child to play with, and great for a collector to have as well. Some people have complained about the high price to pay to get this, and all I can say is ""shop around"". I paid a little over $20 for each of them, and it was worth it to me."
1,Not a durable toy...Health hazard,"First off I bought this toy from an AMAZON seller for 5 times what it really cost. That was my fault so I cannot be mad at the ""rip-off"" that sold it to me. Second and most importantly when I began to change from car to robot small parts fell off and one of the legs broke off. I have a two year old who could have easily put one of the parts in his mouth and chocked. Hasbro has contacted me and asked me to return the item so it can be looked at as far as a Health hazard it may create. I live and learn.Transformers Movie Deluxe Class Bumblebee 2008 Camaro"
2,Badly Designed,"My son was very excited about getting the ""Bumble bee"" and had asked for it for some time. The only place I could find it was at Amazon. Quick shipping and the item had arrived.It looked nice and my son started to play with it. However, once he ""transformed"" the car into the robot, it was quite difficult to turn it back into the car again; he couldn't do it, his older brother and his mother couldn't figure it out. Typically I end up helping others figure things out, but felt quite helpless turning the robot back into the car. Yes, I finally did it after 5 hours of trial and error. The pieces don't fit together well and it is very easy to turn the wrong way and break small pieces. In any case I will be in quite an agony once my son transforms it back into robot and asks me to turn it back into the car again :-("
3,Good toy,"This toy is very cool but the head keeps falling off! My kid has to be very careful when playing with it and is always worried that Bumblebee might lose his head! But it is cool though, we just need the bigger one now!"
2,Horrible - dont buy it,"First - I bought this for 10dollars at toysrus. Second - my son, myself - everyone was so excited to get this toy - and we were soo disappointed!! It takes an engineering degree to change it from the car to the autobot and forget about back again. Parts come flying off (although they are easily reattached) and it NEVER i repeat NEVER looks the same once you change it from one form to another - my son could not even use it as a car because the tires dont easily align. A waste of money and excitement."
1,Very disappointing,We bought this for my son that just turned 5 because he is crazy about Transformers. Just as my husband was taking it out of the package and getting it ready it practically fell apart. This toy is not sturdy at all. Adding insult to injury was the fact that we found this sames toy in stores $15 less in stores. We felt ripped off and now my son does not have his beloved Bumblebee.
3,not easy to transform,Without the instructions it's almost impossible to transform the toy. And even with the instructions it's not that easy. An adult has to make it. They should be easier in order to start having fun with it.My boy still loved it.
1,You people are dumb!,"Whoever pays money for this stupid piece of garbage is just about as stupid as (...), and she is really dumb!!! This has three good songs on it. ""The Reason"" by hoobastank, which is the overplayed song of the year along with ""This Love"" ""Meant to live"" by switchfoot, which is also overplayed, and ""Ocean Avenue"" by yellowcard. Thats it! The rest is overplayed and neververy good to begin with, or was just absolute crap from the moment it was first played. I hope all these crappy rap and R&B artists die!!! If you are reading this review you are either admiring at my hatred which matches your own, or taking offense. If you are taking offense by reading this review, you should take your head, and crush it through your window. Good luck!"
1,The Different,"NOW: FOR THE CHILDREN WHO DON'T KNOW TALENT. BEGINNING TO FLOP ALMOST AS MUCH AS BRITNEY SPEARS AND 1-HIT-WONDERS JOJO AND CIARA!TOTALLY HITS: FOR THE PEOPLE WHO MOSTLY KNOW TALENT, BUT DON'T FOCUS ON TALENT AS MUCH AS WHO THEY CAN QUICKLY GET TO SIGN A CONTRACT TO GET ON THE CD. TOTALLY HITS 2001 WAS THE BEST."
2,average at best,"there aren't alot of cuts here that I dig on a whole but a Cut like ""Move your Body"" is a fun jam. truth is most of these Acts belong on this kind of Compilation because to have to sit through a whole disc of there stuff would put you to sleep.I can see the appeal of these type of compilations because as I've said before some of these Acts at best are looking at 3-4 song Careers at most."
2,"Flat, but better than some other NOW complications","1. D12 My Band - Once again, starting a Now off bad. F2. Outkast Hey Ya!- Bad songs will continue until announced otherwise. F3. Beyonce Naughty Girl- F4. Nina Sky Move Ya Body. F5. Christina Milian Dip It Low- F6. Black Eyed Peas Hey Mama- F7. Beenie Man Dude- F8. Petey Pablo Freek-A-Leek- F9. Juvenile Slow Motion- F10.

Switchfoot Meant To Live- Switchfoot is an okay band. B-19. Los Lonely Boys Heaven- Adult contemparary gone bad. C-20. Gretchen Wilson Redneck Woman- I hate country. It's nasty. FOh, look, five good songs for $15! Of course, I could download them on iTunes and save $10..."
1,Now that's what I call horrible music,"Like a good little music fan I've been buying all the NOW THAT'S MUSIC series, some were good, some weren't, but I kept buying them because I'm an audiophile and want to complete my collection...but I gotta tell you, this one is by far the worst of the lot.There were maybe two songs on this entire CD worth listening to, the rest being made up either by crap (whoops, I mean rap) music you've never heard before, or songs that have been played so many times on the radio that listening to them is as annoying as nails scraping on a blackboard. This isn't music for audiophiles- it's a blatant attempt to make a buck off of gullible suckers like myself who will buy these CDs regardless of whatever garbage the publishers put on it because it's part of a series. If this CD was an automobile, it'd violate your state's Lemon Laws.Keep this up, people, and my collection ends with number 16."
4,my favorite now cd,"This is the best now cd there is. i like all of the songs except for gretchen wilson. i think that you should buy this cd if you like listening to a lot of different things. if you only like one kind of music, stick to just buying cds made by one artist."
2,Only 3 Good Songs!,"There are only 3 good songs on this NOW CD. The ones I like are:Dude by Beenie Man-5/5, Hey Mama by Black Eyed Peas-4/5, and OneCall Away by Chingy-5/5.If you only like hip-hop, don't buy thiscd!"
4,Buy NOW now,"This CD has some good tunes and some clunkers too. Plus, a lot of them are overplayed on the radio today like Hoobastank. The thing I like about the NOW series is that I can buy the CD, put it away for a year or five, then take it out and relive some memories of a specific time period. For example, NOW 2 has Baby One More Time by Britney, I'll Never Break Your Heart by the Backstreet Boys, two great songs by one-hit wonders, etc., and the CD is fun to listen to on occasion because it reminds me of a fun time in my life! So yes, these songs are overplayed now, but buy the CD and enjoy it 5+ years from now! It'll by like you are back in time, in the spring and summer of 2004, listening to the radio all over again!"
2,Very bad,"D12 sucks. Outkast is okay, but the selected track sucks. Beyonce by herself sucks. Nina Sky sucks. The Black Eyed Peas suck. Beenie Man sucks. Petey Pablo sucks. Juvenile sucks. JoJo sucks. Chingy sucks. Britney Spears sucks d!ck. Jessica Simpson does too. Yellowcard sucks. Gretchen Wilson sucks.Things worth downloading from this CD on iTunes or whatever:Christina Milian ""Dip It Low""Hoobastank ""The Reason""Lenny Kravitz ""Where Are We Runnin'?""Three Days Grace ""Just Like You""Switchfoot ""Meant To Live""Los Lonely Boys ""Heaven""Grade: D- (2 stars)"
1,played out,"I'm only writing this review to tell all you people to stop saying that Slow Motion is a bad song. It happens to be the only good song on the entire Now CD! Every other song is completely played out. If you listen to a pop station for 1/2 hour, you will hear a lot of the songs on this cd. So I think you people should not waste your money and go buy the Juvenile CD."
4,Best one in a while,"They made some wise choices with this cd. Yellowcard, Three Days Grace, JOJO, Black Eyed Peas, Britney Spears. The reast aren't very good thought, except Hoobastank. They continue to let rap dominate these cd's, which I find disappointing because rap isn't real music. But it is a good cd."
2,"Good, but....","Even though I like a lot of the songs on here, 'Now' should change their title to 'Then.' ""Hey Ya"" is awesome but it is SUCH an old song-they could have put it on Now 14 or even Now 13. I hate the way Now puts songs that are like several months to a year old on their discs. I mean, don't call it 'Now' if it's not what's happening 'now'!! They should try to get their hands on the MOST recent stuff-they should have had Ashlee Simpson's ""Pieces Of Me,"" Outkast's ""Roses"" (hate that song but it's more recent than ""Hey Ya""), Britney Spears's ""Outrageous,"" and songs that we were hearing on the radio when this was released. I am glad they included ""Move Ya Body,"" ""My Band,"" ""The Reason,"" ""Dip It Low,"" and a few others because those are more recent. But....NOW, next time try to get the radio hits we're hearing NOW!"
2,Bad song choices,"I have bought all of the NOW cds and this one is definitely a miss. Most of the tracks on here are over-played and less than mediocre pop trash. These songs have absolutely no potential. There are only a handful of good songs on here; My Band, Naughty Girl, One Call Away, The Reason, Just Like You, Meant To Live, and Redneck Woman. Out of 20 songs, those are the only ones worth listening to. I know there will be a lot of teens that will disagree with me because these are their idols and favorite singers. However, the songs on here have no substance. In my opinion, NOW 12 is the best one up to date. Save your money, don't purchase this cd."
5,I luv this cd,It seems the now cds just get better and better. This is without a doubt the best one yet!

1,That's What We Call Music?,"I'm afraid this album actually does represent the state of what is commercially driven ""popular"" music in this country these days. It reveals how little meaning is to be found in most of what is released under the auspices of creative effort. It would behoove us to try to remove ourselves from the hype and improve our tastes or the rest of the world will eventually leave us behind in our money-driven mediocrity."
4,Now 16 Review,"Its awesome all the way around! I love alot of the songs, and like all of them! Some of them could've done w/o being on there, and they missed a few that they shoulda put on like Usher's ""Yeah"", but over all, it was prolly their best cd of all of the NOWS!-Lydia"
2,Not this one...,"Id just like to know how to get a refund? The remote worked golden for the first set of batteries when they went dead though all the keys froze to completely different settings and when I replaced the batteries and tried to reprogram it, its officially broken!"
3,Bring back the previous edition!,The current edition is such a disappointment. The book itself is smaller (instead of being 8x11) and the type is much smaller. It is very difficult to read especially since the page is cluttered with five languages rather than just English. Please lobby the publisher to bring back the previous larger edition with its clean layout. It *could* be such a great teaching tool but is too frustrating for beginning readers in its present state. I wish I had bought it before it went out of print :(
1,Buyer Beware,"My assumption proved wrong because I failed to believe the retailer could charge $24.99 for one Corelle cereal bowl. However, after receiving my order, the box did in fact contain one single cereal bowl for the above mentioned price."
3,Love the bowl but not the price,I know Corelle is a good brand but they sell them at Kmart. I paid with SH over $7 for one cereal bowl. No fancy design just white. I should have went to Kmart and bought the set for a few bucks more
1,Read ads very closely,Well I am really thankful I read all of the reviews and noticed this price was for 1 bowl only. That is insane. Wal-mart carries the Corelle line of dishes and you can buy those bowls there for a couple of dollars a piece. I am surprised Amazon allows dealers to rip people off like that. I have always bragged about Amazon to my friends and recommended them to everyone. Good to know they do not always make their vendors do the right thing.I'll keep that in mind when shopping here and read all the fine print
2,Horrible in the beginning but gets a little better later,"This book is definitely not a casual read. Unfortunately, our professor chose this book for our History in Urban Planning course. Kostof wrote this book using big words, it seems, trying to prove his mastery and great command of the English language. Making it worst is his inference from numerous examples that baffles the beginning learner with no previous historical knowledge of urban forms. It takes three hours to read something that should only take one and you will only understand 35% of what was read. If you have the patience and commitment to learn history...in urban planning, the book gets better later on. Therefore, I changed my 1 star to 2 stars. Nevertheless, I still hate this book but for a good laugh, I might keep it on the coffee table and refer people to this book when they ask what Urban Planning is all about."
1,ONE Plate,"Please be advised that for the approximately 25-30 dollars (with shipping charges) one spends on this item, one will get ONE little bread and butter plate. MANY other sites sell SIX such plates (exactly the same Corelle number) for about the same price. And, when you return it, Amazon will charge you for the return shipping."
5,Wha' happen??,"Where is Harstads new book? It was due to be released Jan 2005, and is not availble. The publisher changed and everything went downhill from there. Is Donald dead or what? Does anyone know what is going on in Elkader,Iowa?"
4,STILL PRETTY STRONG,"Season 3 starts off pretty strong for the first few episodes. Then it becomes a mixed bag. For me the most painful episodes to watch are The Buccaneers and A New Beginning. These are guested by Jesse Ventura a dazzling big mouth wrestling commentator back in the day. But as an actor? All the FaBreeze, Oust, and Lysol combined couldn't get the stink out. And the kid who played his son was no better, P U! As for the rest of the season you have to go through one or two bad episodes at a time to get to a really good one. Plus the swordplay is a little scarce in this season, but what swordplay there is it looks great as always. The characters are all still solid and it is still worth watching, but I recommend you get Seasons 1 and 2 first. (which is an obvious thing to do) and sort of glide through this and look for the hidden jewels."
5,Delias Vegetarian Cookery,Very pleased with the book and extrenely pleased with Amazon and the service they offered in replacing a damaged copy.
1,Awfull,The quality of this video substandard and is not worthy of being part of the Amazon library. Although the cost was less than 2 dollars the rental should be refunded
1,Warning old book under new cover,"I bought the 1993 through 1995 book. since I own a 1997 Gd Cherokee I bought the 1993 through 1998 edition. My disapointement was great, when I discovered, that the book is exactly the same and not up to date. The only changes are title page, copyright and ISBN number. Many important new features are not described at all. Changes are not accounted for."
3,Limited overall detail primary for major overhaul,This repair manual in primarily for major overhaul of the engine. Other information is good but not real detailed.
5,Good business,Arrived a little late but was in good and excellent condition as advertised. Will do business again with this seller in the future.
3,Great resource book!,"This book has definitely served a purpose. I've been able to refer to it on several occasions. If you're a jeep owner, it's worth buying."
5,"quick delivery, met my expectations","thanks so much - everything was smooth and easy on my side of the deal, and I got exactly what I was expecting."
2,"Ok, but not hard back","Product was in good condition, but appeared to be a hard cover book in the posting but was paper back when it arrived. I was disappointed."
5,"Short Read, Long Lasting Message",This is a short book but packed inside are thoughts and advice that will stay with you long after you read it. Pema Chodron is a fine writer and her advice on finding the peace within is something everyone needs. I highly recommend buying this book and sharing it with others.
3,FCE with Sony HDR-HC1,"I am dissappointed that Apple did not make FCE HD compatible with the Sony HD camcorder. The upgrade at addition charge to HD 3.5 makes it compatible, but not fully functional in Capture mode. i.e. In DV mode the clips are selectable by time marker, but in HDV mode there is no device (camera) control.Once the Capture process is completed it works fine. It would be nice to have some of the simple to use features included in iMovie."
1,only got 1! It said 6,"I only got one canvas and it clearly says ""pack of 6""! Where are my other 5!? This is stupid"
1,Don't expect 6 canvases!,Frustrating! I only got one canvas when the order came. I called Amazon and they had me return it and reorder. I reordered while on the phone and he placed a note with the order to make sure I got six. I got the package the next day and again had only one canvas. I called Amazon again. The rep called the warehouse to see what was going on. Evidently someone was opening the six packs because they thought they were for individual sale. They are supposed to be correcting the problem. I did not reorder.. He said it might take a couple of days for them to get it repackaged into packs of six.
1,You really will only get 1,"I doubted that so many ppl could complain about ordering 6 canvases and only getting 1 without Amazon correcting this blatant scam, so I took my chances and ordered despite the reviews. I got only 1 too. Don't test your luck."
1,also received just one,"Please read these reviews, and don't order this item. I was in a hurry and made the mistake of not looking at the reviews, and also got one canvas instead of the advertised six. Apparently this has been happening since July, and this vendor still enjoys ripping people off."
1,YOU WILL NOT GET SIX CANVASES!!,"Apparently, I missed all of the other feedback given when I ordered this. This is a scam- description says that it is a pack of six, but you only receive one. I did not even try to rectify the situation, based on what I read from all of the other buyers who have left comments. I just returned my one canvas, and I will go to a legitimate art supply store."
1,6=1?,"I ordered 2 packs of 6 for a Christmas gift. When they arrived on December 22, there were 2 individual canvases. I'm not going to take a chance on re-ordering them this close to Christmas. UPS just picked up for return. Nice going guys."
4,Worked for my project,"I needed a canvas to attach vinyl lettering too. After a couple coats of spray paint and adhering my lettering, my project came out beautiful. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because there were minor dents/imperfections around the edge. Not a big deal on a home project, but if I was making something to sell, it wouldn't have been sellable, under my standards."
3,Perfect for someone just starting out!,"Bought this canvas for myself because I am trying to be like Basquiat, something came over and my doodles went to oodles. I use spray paint, oil, watercolor, acrylic, I bang them all out on this canvas. Not the best deal on Amazon (since purchasing I found better) but it was okay for the money that I paid. As I am just starting out my masterpieces are running to pieces. If only I had a place for the storage of the porridge."
3,Good Canvas but not for acrylics or water colors,"Good quality canvas, but I had difficultly with acrylics and water colors. You have to use a lot of paint with acrylics to get it to look nice. I would recommend these for oils or other thinker paints. Oh and they have a really weird smell, not a big deal but if you've got a sensitive nose it will bother you. Price wise this is a really nice deal."
1,1 not 6,"i recieved this item in a smaller package then expected, as it seems there is an error in the labeling it is for only one canvas not 6, other then that the company was good at giving me a quick refund so i am happy, one last thing to add is the canvas is not as tight as i like them but good quality."
1,Poor Advertisement,"I ordered the 6 pack and after a week and a half, received only one canvas. It was to do gifts for Mother's day. The one canvas was NOT on time and when I inquired about the other five, I was told it was advertised wrong. They did refund my money right away, so I consider the customer service great, but advertised wrong??? Come on. Now I need to order some more from somewhere else! Frustrating!!!As far as quality of canvas, I haven't used it yet, so I would refer to the other reviews. It seems to look good."
2,Supermart lies!,"Do not buy from Supermart. I ordered this 6 pack when it was advertised at 5.85 for the whole pack and like mjob, I only received one, with absolutely NO response to my email complaint. No replacement canvases and no refund. At all. I love this brand of stretched art canvas, as it's perfect for oil paints, but I've had much more success with the buyer FineArtStore. It's a little pricier, but take a look at some of their marked down items, and it's worth it to have the product you paid for in the ad. This ad has since been changed, thankfully, and hopefully those of you who do decide to buy through these folks will actually get all of the canvases you order."
3,4 wheeler cab thoughts,"I really love the idea of the cab. It is much warmer inside and of course dried, but, the view around the close proximity is obstructed, and for snow plowing it is a critical view for the work involved. The headlight is also obstructed and the zippers on the windows do not slide smoothly. They catch sometimes getting stuck. I wonder how long they will work, or last.The top is not tight and therefore holds snow or water, it should have some curve to it and be tighter. Over all,, I think it is over priced. You can buy a really nice tent for under $100.00 with more material, work, and better quality. A good idea that needs some improvements.I must say though, I am keeping it. I would rather have it than nothing:-)"
4,Works for wind,"The Camo is much better than the picture, much darker and looks like real Camo. It went together as directed and I tried it in single digit temps and wind and you can really tell a difference. At this point well worth the money, less than $100. One tip is to let it warm up before you work with it. I did not and got a small hole in the clear plastic at a fold point, don't know if it was there from shipping or it happened when I was working with it in the cold. I figure a little hot glue and a piece of plastic will fix it, it is a tool so this will probably not be the last wear and tear on it."
1,what a joke,"A matte latte? Please! To any self-respecting mate (no accent, no double ""t's"") drinker, this must be an insult. Mate made with a french presss... I can barely stabd the fact this travesty of a traditional South American drink. America, enjoy your mokachinos with fattening whipped cream and stay out of nuestro mate! Plase do not buy this novelty product."
2,Stamps.com doesn't always work with IE9,"Have been a customer of theirs for years, and have had a series of software compatability issues, but this last one, as of Mar 2011 is a real kicker . . after I upgraded from IE8 to IE9 (win7 64bit OR 32bit, I tried both) their software stopped working . . after a series of their folks worked with me and their own testing couldn't reproduce the problem, they basically said, ""yr on yr own,"" instead of spending more time with me to isolate the issue, so that OTHER customers don't have the same problem . . I canceled . . . buggy UI, not enough resolve when the problem isn't immediately apparent to their support folks.They have had other similar problem solving technique when in a previous version, they stopped being able to print international labels, I give up . . USPS.com does the same thing for free, and doesn't cost $16 a month."
1,Color misleading from picture,"The picture of the letters is an aqua blue. When I received the letters , they were royal blue. They do not match my bulletin board."
1,Vendor Sells dirty stained merchandise,These came stained and dirty looking. They had brown rusty looking stains all over the edges. Were they used instead of new as advertised? We were able to scrub off the rust or brown dirty stains with course steel wool but this has scratched the finish somewhat and they will probably get dull looking much sooner in those spots than it should therefore shortening the life expectancy of these by about 75%
3,"Simple, Elegant Serving Platter","The platter is exactly as described. The platter is pure white, and was exactly what I was looking for to display my reindeer Christmas cookies. The reason I gave a 3-star rating is I actually ordered 10 platters to give as gifts. When the package arrived, one of the platters was missing and another was shattered. Amazon promptly sent out 2 platters as replacement, and my plans to give them as gifts was not affected."
1,Upset,"I purchased this items Feb. 2012, and used it for the first time yesterday. I removed it from the refrigerator today to slice a piece off the ham I baked yesterday. When the knife hit the platter after slicing threw the meat it broke in half. Very disappointed; I own numerous pieces of Corelle and this is a first."
5,Simple but fab!,"I wanted to add to the mounting Corelle platter collection we heap upon my mom and so purchased this one. Although I've had some serious problems with orders through Amazon, this went smoothly and the platter is simple, but functional and makes the Mater happy, so it served it's purpose....no pun intended....I think."
3,Almost the same size as the dishes.,Almost the same size as the dishes. I don't think is worth to buy if you have a 30 pieces set.
4,Great product,"I had been searching for this platter at the stores for sometime, but all the stores were sold out. I was so glad to find it here on Amazon and at a much better price! I only gave this product 4 stars because I pictured it a little bigger."
4,THIS IS A REALLY GREAT BOOK BASED ON THE BRAND NEW SERIES,I really like this book because I love so little time.It's so great and funny and when I'm in a bad mood that series do always cheer me up.
4,totally cool!,This book was very good!and its my fav book out of the serise so far.chloe is learning how to cook and riely is learning how to sew and design.When there mam and dad have an interveiw and they want riely to show her designs and chloe to pepare a meal! one probblem they just cant get it right!!!!!!
5,Got me hooked,"I started reading DL in the mid-90's, but I started by being given one of these as a gift. They're hard to find, but well worth it if you can find them. They're based on the books, but even if you've already read the chronicles trilogy, it's well worth it. Recommend these with the highest regards."
4,Great bits of advice in easy to read format,"The former CEO of Helzberg Diamonds shares wisdom he has learned from over 30 years in business before selling to Warren Buffett.I have read a lot of management books and this was one of the easier (less dry) reads. At less than 230 pages, with decent size font, and lots of 1/2 pages, most readers can get through this in a couple of hours. I mean this in a positive way. The author does not waste words or the readers time. Lots of valuable information in here and I highly recommend anyone interested in managing or running a business read this. Helzberg's integrity and genuine nature get across throughout the book.There are references toFirst, Break All the Rules: What the World's Greatest Managers Do Differentlyin here. That is a great book as well and its influence on Helzberg is clearly evident. Another book he references significantly is Good to Great. I have tried to read that book several times, but have always found it too boring to proceed through."
2,Stating the Obvious,"This book has two major flaws.First, Helzberg's ""tips"" are hardly insightful. That doesn't mean they are wrong, or flawed, though reasonable people would disagree about some of them. Instead, most suffer from being obvious. This would be acceptable, in my opinion, if this were a narrative of how he and his family and team built the company, which leads me to the second flaw: its structure. The book is structured as 80 ""helpful hints,"" each roughly 3 to 5 pages long, making it extremely disjointed.If you're a college student studying business, or somebody embarking on an entrepreneurial venture without any experience, this book could prove useful. If you have any experience, however, you are unlikely to find it illuminating."
3,Lucifer's Crown,"Good versus evil would be the synopsis. Naturally Good wins. It is full of various legends and religions, which serve to mask the theological point that evil is something man gets involved in because of the free will God gave him, and Good, at its very lowest level is the struggle won by man against the temptations of being alive. Actually, the book seems to prove that the Father of Lies actually does take human form and creates absolute havoc. So, the good man, Thomas Becket, dies as a price for his sin and to help disperse some evil from the world, and the human form of the devil does a meltdown - very appropriate.It is not an easy book, and one that I would not recommend to anyone who knows little about religions, signs and symbols, etc.I am not sure Jean Anouilh would like it!Linda Sheean"
5,Pat is a genius,"Pat has a very interesting approach to guitar. He demonstrates how various chords can be derived from just one diminished chord. Then when one shifts finger positions with the same diminished chord shape, they can come to yet another group of chords based on the same idea. By just raising or lowering a 3rd, 5th or 7th note in each diminished shape, you derive at a M7, m7, Dom7 etc etc. I thought the way he laid out this idea was very useful to any guitarist from beginner to advanced. I would highly recommend this video to anyone especially a Pat Martino fan."
4,Great Information,This video is a great insight into how a master of jazz guitar operates. It is a very simple approach to guitar while being so advanced! It comes with the PDF which is great to follow along with. I would recommend this for any Pat Martino enthusiast.
5,Smooth transitions and Very Stable,"I have had excellent results with this tripod. I actually bought another one from a different manufacturer at the same time that I bought this one, and there isn't any comparison. This one has a sturdy, solid feel to the stand, with a very fluid movement of the head once the camcorder was installed. The height is what it is...OK for what I was doing, but I wish I would have bought a taller one now because I am using it at the rear of a worship center and sometimes tall people get in the way. Great value is you're on a budget!"
3,Not Durable,"I ordered several of these and one of them was broken right out of the box. Aside from the center column and the legs, everything is made out of plastic. I just had another one break today. The plastic gear that engages the center column snapped in half.My favorite thing about this tripod, other than the price and the weight is that you can tilt the camera mount up to 90 degrees. I'm about to find out about the warranty service."
4,"Easy to use, powerful flash, great ergonomics","I purchased the IS20 in July 2001. My first interest in it was its design. Not only does it look good, but its shape and ergonomics makes it really easy to hold, handle and operate. We often forget to admit that looks are one of the major purchase motivations.The second thing i liked about it was ease of use. if you have minimal camera operation experience you might never read the manual at all!It also integrates a powerful flash. My boss told me once that he thought it was on fire when it blinked to reduce red eye effect.The 28-110 mm zoom is also nice, quick. Battery life seems above average (I still have not changet it).Negative aspects?Probably its weight and size, its definately not a camera you would stick in your pocket.You will notice that when the camera is on the lens sticks all the way out wich makes it look more like an Olympus IS3000."
1,The camera that keeps on giving....,"If you want a trouble free camera that isn't gonna be in the shop, buy something else. Our camera like this one broke last winter and we sent it into be repaired by Olympus. They fixed it for $ and sent it back to us. Takes great pictures, just never seems to be out of the shop. Look at Nikons and Canons for cameras without discounts on price. They don't need to discount because they are built better."
1,"IS-20 , bad pictures","I've been using this camera for about 4 mos. already upgrading from a point/shoot olympus clamshell camera and was very much dissappointed with the quality of the pictures,. It definitely looks cool but the output was terrible, overexposure, dark backgrounds. I tried auto mode and manual mode. Can't say more but I am definitely not recommending this camera."
2,What a CRAPPY camera!,The pictures are terrible!!!!I thought it might have been the first roll of film because I left it in the car on a warm day so I tried two more rolls!!! They're sooo dark! Even the ones I took on the beach this morning on an absolutely gorgeous day.I carried this camera with me to my graduation instead of my bulkier camera because of its compactibility (is that a word?). I'm upset that I entrusted those memories to this camera.It's also very confusing to figure out. I have a Minolta QT-si that I'll stick with from now on.
5,Perfect for me!,"I love this camera. I wanted a camera that I can take good family photos with as well as use to learn a bit about the basics of photography. The directions were easy to understand, and it took no time at all to figure it out and start shooting. My favorite is the portrait mode. It's very simple to use, and the results are fantastic!"
4,I like it!,"I am a scrapbooking fiend and I was tired of my regular cameras because I always had to get so close to the subject in order to take a shot. I wanted more portrait like pictures as well as being able to stand away from the subject in order to catch those candid shots.I actually have two other olympus cameras. I have an olympus stylus 115, which is nice and has a decent zoom, but didn't give me the picutres I was looking for.I have been taking pictures with my new camera like a fiend and I love them. The pictures have been crisp and clean...the way I like them, and I don't have to stand right in front of the subject to take a picture.I actually feel like I am taking professional pictures! Anyway, that's it. Thanks."
1,More apologists who think Cuba is a free country,"This is so sad that people don't care what Cuba is really like, where there is NO freedom of political opposition and communism has ravaged the economy"
1,Cuba: Talking about Revolution: Conversation with Jaun A Bla,"Lies, lies and more lies. The author know how to be a good lier.He know the true, I knew personally for long time, he can not write about how Castro has being destroyed one country and his peoples. The author all the time had confort for his father and his mother, Elena Gil Comunisty Nomeclature's Member.He learned very good how to hide the true and the honor.DR. Ed Pridaformer political prisoneranti castro activist"
2,No taps. Ad misleading,Shoes fit. No taps provided. Have purchased many tap shoes. All had taps provided for the size of the shoes.
5,one of our favorite Henry & Mudge stories,This is one of our favorites - for the whole family. We like the humor and thoughtfulness of the story. This one is on our top 10 list from the series
1,Five stars for Cynthia Rylant,I suggest Cynthia Rylant's Henry and Mudge books to every little grandchild that love to read or be read to. My granddaughter loves all Cynthia's stories. Every book is new adventure.........
3,Muzak,"I hate to disappoint anybody. This is just shallow, pleasant music, like you'd expect to hear at K-mart or Target while looking at discount shoes. It won't distract you if you have work to do, it's cheerful and upbeat, it has a high production quality, but it's nothing special.So if that's what you want, this is it. Don't imagine you're getting anything off the cutting edge here, but it's certainly something you can listen to while you work."
3,"OK Kenworth Book. The only ""fancy history Hc"" done on KW.","I got this book when it first came out as To my knowledge at the time it was the only book on Kenworth. Book is okay. Not great, Considering there has not been any re-issues(Note:if you do re-issue please do proper job and fill with more pics and history) This book never gets into detail too much on any one subject. Its overall design is nice. But as you read it you know there is gaps missing. certainly it needs to be filled in as well as more color pictures than it already has.And more Reading. Otherwise a Decent book.If you like to read like I do get this one. If you just like to stare at pictures then get Ron Adams 1950-1979 KW book which is better for pics.but reading is less. both books are welcome additions to any library.Despite one having flaws."
4,Good story,I found Azure Bonds a rousing adventure with a interesting characters. The mystery of Alias an here companions kept me reading it straight through.
5,My new kozy 122 heater,I would recomend this heater to anyone looking for this type of heater. It hooked up easy and worked like it should. Low setting on no:1 keeps my area at 45 deg. perfect for what I wanted. Just one thing wrong with the heater---It's not manifactured in my U.S.A.......This is how happy I am with this unit. Thank You.
1,Any wind will blow out pilot,"I have the manual light heater for my small greenhouse. Wind kept blowing out the pilot, so I had an auto electric ignition system installed twice at around $250. It finally blew out the pilot system. I am looking for something else now."
1,Product defective,I bought this heater for supplemental heat. Used it a month and one of the bricks fell apart and rendered the heater useless. I returned it for a refund.
1,"""El Inmigrante"" DVD","The copy I purchased is flawed and I intend return it for a refund, then buy another one. The DVD stopped several times while my husband and I were watching it. We had to forward it to continue watching. The film was made by family friends and I would like a good copy of it."
2,nothing special,"It's a bulky and noisy camera. Pictures comes out ok- nothing spectacular. I used to think it was me being the bad photographer or I chose the wrong type of film, but after reading the other reviews- it's the camera."
1,don't buy!!!,"This camera seemed great at first. But a few months after I received this thing, it seemed like the very loud noises it makes were getting slower. I changed the batteries, thinking this would help, but this did no good. The mechanism covering the lens that you slide open and closed IS very breakable, as my lens rarely works. I took very good care of this camera, but the lens has a mind of its own. It zooms out only occasionally..., do not waste your time or money."
3,"Good, Bad and Ugly","All combined in one. I bought this in Amazon site and the first thing I noticed was it made a lot of noise while operating. Pretty soon I was embarassed to operate the camera in front of my friends, because of the loud noise it made (Ugly). I'm still not sure how to make the flash work automatically (Bad). Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. The first snap I took with the camera was with a Self timer. After that I've not been able to get the Self timer working (Ugly). What's good then? - The prints. I liked the quality of the prints I got, which is why I did not return the camera to Amazon yet. If you want a cheap camera which has builtin Zoom and do not mind the noise and erratic flash then this is a good buy."
2,Not so great.,"I recently bought this camera from Amazon and I've had nothing but disapointment. It's relatively easy to use, until you get your pictures back, the colors are all wrong, nothing is in focus, a lot of my pictures have come back blury. I've taken family trips and taken many photos of which never develop correctly, you can't take those kind of things back, so I'm left with nothing. It could be the film, it could be the processing but I've never had any trouble with those two factors until I've used this camera. I would not reccommend buying this camera and if anyone has any suggestions as to what type of camera I should try, I would greatly appreciate it!"
2,Unhappy with this camera,".... It does take okay photos, but the flash mechanism functions very strangely. Even when fully charged, it sometimes does not go off - even when it should. This meant I had to take two of the same shot in order to guarantee I got it. It seems like if you don't press the button down hard enough, it takes the photo w/o the flash. The flash takes a few seconds to recharge, so you can't take a lot of photos close together. It also takes double A batteries, not a photo battery, and does not have an auto-rewind feature. The lens closing is also strange. In order to turn the camera off, you push the plastic lens cover against the side of the lens, which triggers the lens to retract fully. It seems to me that this is a very ""breakable"" way for it to work. I ended up returning this and buying a Canon Sure Shot."
2,"Clunky, noisy but still okay","This camera is really a mixed bag. I hate absolutely everything about it: too noisy, zoom too slow, unimpressive viewfinder, etc. But even as bad as this camera is, I took some really amazing pictures with it. You know the saying: It is a poor workman who blames his tools...I'm not saying that those who got bad pictures with it don't know how to take photos but I have to admit that out of the several hundreds of photos I took with it, only a few were really bad, and it's mostly because the setting was too dark (I mostly take outdoor photography and sunsets).I'm definitely looking for a new camera because this one is just too clunky, noisy, slow and [...] ugly. But it has served me well for a couple of years now and I'm happy with my photos, so in the end, that's what counts.3 stars."
2,not good,"I have taken four or five rolls of photos and the colors are bad. They are mostly too bright or fogged out. The pics come out a little better with the zoom, zoomed. I sadly gave it to my mom, istead of blowing it up. We bought a Sigma Sa-9 and feel much better on quality."
4,Midwestern Folk Music for gentle listening,"The title track and Joel Mabus's ""Hopelessly Midwestern"" stand out on this CD. The rest or the songs, while pleasant, are difficult for me to recall, even after multiple listenings while driving to and from work. Good humor permeates every track, and it is professionally done."
3,"lots of stretching and warmup, not much running","Turning to the first page of this book, I expected a hard hitting, unified description of ""truth in an age of unbelief."" The book is definitely hard hitting, and Chuck Colson is renowned for his willingness to take on issues that are controversial.What's missing in this book is unity. This book is essentially a series of anecdotes. ""Eclectic"" is the word that comes to mind. This is a good book to read, I guess, if you only have three pages worth of time to read in each sitting, and you don't mind switching topics after those three pages. Or it might be useful to students looking for ideas to develop into a research paper.That type of content proved too fragmented for me to enjoy. This was my first book by this author; I will check the Table of Contents more carefully before beginning my next Chuck Colson book."
4,The conclusion....,"The final conclusion to a very good trilogy. This book can be quite brutal, and to be honest, it is refreshing to see someone take risks with the characters they are writing about. This book will be great for all X-Men fans, as it has non-stop action, character dilemma, and numerous guest-appearances by Marauders, Tusk, Blob, Toad, Pyro, etc. Not to mention Juggernaut teams up with the X-Men, and he is written FAR better than his other book we'll get to much later. A good read for all! Here's the score:1) X-Men: Mutant Empire (series)2) Daredevil: Predator's Smile3) Hulk: What Savage Beast4) Fantastic Four: To Free Atlantis5) Ultimate Spider-Man6) Spider-Man: Carnage in New York"
5,Mutant Empire Finale,"A exciting end to a wonderfully done trilogy. Golden does not leave out any facts. He includes many different mutants from the wide spread background of the X-Men. With Manhattan taken over by Magneto and half of the X-Men captured, things look bleak. Fortunately the X-Mens stuck in space are able to get back to earth and devise a plan to stop Magneto from achieving his goal. Amazingly, Juggernaut joins the X-Men in conquering Magneto. After the fierce rescue it comes down to all out brawl between the X-Men and the mutants of new Haven. In the end it is possible this leads to the Asteriod M saga."
5,This book is thrilling,This book is facinating the way that the X-Men have to overcome there fury with one of their most horrifying foes. You wont belive what will come of the island of Manhattan!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,"If you're looking for a graphic novel, keep looking.","I'm sorry I was looking for something with a little more art. This isn't the first comic to cross over into novel form, too bad amazon shopers can't actually see the merchandise they are buying. The description of the book is a little ambiguous. It may be a well written book, but I was looking for graphic novels and this did mention that there were illustrators for the novel. I wish I knew that there would only be a few illustrated pages."
4,This book is a tremendous reference.,"As I approached single parent status a little more than a year ago, weary from the weight of the child I carried inside, I had a difficult time finding a book which addressed my concerns and needs. How would I deal with my ex? How would I make ends meet? This book offered more than black and white solutions. It offered the encouragement that I so desperately needed. In addition, I loved the fact that this was the ONLY book I have found to date on single parenting which addresses the unique needs of those of us who have never been married and are committing to single parenting from pregnancy on. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a resource."
3,Too Much Information,"I ordered this book based upon the other reviews listed. Allthough it was helpful in some aspects, a lot of the topics listed didnt apply to my situation as a single Mom."
1,Dangerous - encouraging women to get themselves in financial trouble,This book is giving out ideas that put women in financial jeopardy and have to rely on family and friends and the government to support them and bail them out.If a woman reads this book and decides to have a child they should sue the authors for a piece of the royalties to bail them out.
3,Single Mom Since i was 3 months pregnant,"I am a 34 year old single mom to a beautiful 13 month old baby girl. The father of my child plays no role whatsoever in my daughter's life it's just Her & I, i work full time and right after work i am a full time mom. MY QUESTION is this i am seeking a book for single moms from the beginning i want a book with insights and help and basically just a self help type book etc, etc............... IF anyone can please help or recommend any books for me i'd greatly appreciate it."
4,Complete Single Mother,"I stumbled on this book a few weeks before I became a single mom. Talk about timing! This is not a book that you read through front to back at once. I found myself using it more as a situational reference guide. I also found that some topice did not apply to me (sections addressing the different ways we became single parents etc), but the parts that were for me were very helpful. It is not a comedic book but it help validate me when I needed it most. If you need a single mom warm and fuzzy chuckle, I recommend you also get the single mom survival guide. It is a small - almost pocket sized book that funny, affiming and just makes you feel like you've been hugged."
4,Very good for the money,"I have used it for a little while since I got this product and have found it great for the money. Very well built, no complains for the moment.I would recommend it!"
4,Good Indoor trainer for this cost,"This is a good Indoor for this cost. Not suitable for MTB's , The MTB tires make an awkward noise while riding on it. The product is sturdy enough to hold good amount of weight. I would Recommend you to buy"
3,Home Cycle trainer!,"I bought this unit and the sold separately front fork stand. So I do not know how the unit works without the front fork stand. That being said, the unit works great, although too pricey, it works for me because I needed to conserve space. When my mountain bike is not attached the unit folds up nicely or just hangs in my garage, unfortunately where it has spent most of it's time. The unit is stable and sturdy, although don't lean over to far while on this unit. I would have given it a 4 star rating, but it's too pricey and I cannot figure out how to get the tension component working (with instructions). When I say tension component I am referring to the mechanism that supposed the tighten the rolling pin to increase friction for the tire. I think some part was missing in the shipped package. Fortunately for me it provides a quite a workout with out that tighteing mechanism. Overall, this unit is good."
1,didn't like it,"The quality is very bad. I can't get the full plans off the DVD It was a waste of money. Interested in solar get ""solar water heating"" by bob ramlow.It is a better investment in solar education materials."
4,Helping your child understand how things work,"While the information in this book is somewhat dated (published in 1971) it contains good cut-away pictures and explanantions of basic everyday methods of transportation (boats, planes, cars) as well as telephones, rockets, etc. that are easy to understand for the younger child (not toddler). My children thoroughly enjoyed this book when they were growing up and I am replacing their worn-out copy for my grandson who is also enjoying it."
2,(Pseudo) Scientific,"Paul Chek has consistently been shown up in the area of science. His over-reliance on swiss balls and ""core stability"" exercises are amusing. This book is good for people who teach classes for non-athletes looking for a bit of challenging fun, and circus performers."
2,A little dissappointing,"I really wanted to get the soundtrack right after I saw the movie. But I was very dissapointed that all the songs were remixes ( except for ""War""). The songs rocked as originals. The remixes are okay, but ""Another one bites the dust"" was not intended to be a hip hop song, and it should remain a rock song. At least the unbutchered version of ""War"" was included or I would of lost all faith in our society."
3,Not As Good As Expected,"This is a pretty good soundtrack that is better than x-files but not as good as godzilla. the only songs worth listening to are Bone Thugs 'War', Wyclef's phat remix of 'another one bites the dust' and the cult's 'love removal machine'"
1,Not for someone with a taste for music,"Even though the cover and the headings of the songs are a reminder of past hits, they are just the opposite. For example, the second song, ""Another one bites the dust"", says it WAS at one time performed by Queen, however, it has been REMIXED. This means that the uncreative people of the world can't think of any origional music themselves, so they take good songs and butcher them enough to make them sound like their own music, but there is still that HINT of the origionl. This is not what i would suggest is the ""Music from the motion picture"". It has the slightest twinge of the songs the titles suggest, but is covered over by fairly abrasive rap. It was not what i was expecting to get. This is the grossest rip-off and misrepresentation of music I have seen for a long time. BUYER BEWARE!!!"
4,A colorful narrative of Jewish life in Argentina,"""Musicians and Watchmakers"" is a first-person narrative about the life of a young Jewish girl in Argentina in the 1940s. Written by Alicia Steimberg, the book has been translated into English by Andrea G. Labinger.Steimberg reflects on the autobiographical roots of this book in an author's note. This is a colorful, frequently humorous narrative. We meet several interesting characters, including her maternal grandmother (an emigrant from Kiev) and her maternal grandfather (a secular Jew and socialist).Steimberg's narrator (named Alicia, like the author) tells about her experience of anti-Semitism, her sexual awakening, her fascination with Roman Catholicism, and other topics. Particularly interesting is the portrayal of life under Peronism. ""Musicians and Watchmakers"" is an enjoyable contribution to both Latin American and Jewish literature."
5,best thing ever,i love this item. very easy to put on the stand and holds quite well i love this and it came in like a day or 2 from where i live which is freaking amazing.
3,Product great. Amazon a bit weird!,"I wanted to purchase 4 of these mugs, and was happy to find them on Amazon Prime. I already had 4 and wanted to add 4 more to complete my service for 8. Here is the weird part. I was only allowed to order three of these - no explanation why. Thought ""well, OK then, I'll order 3 and then put in another order for 1."" NOT. I was told by Amazon in no uncertain terms that three was all I was entitled to. I resorted to having a friend order one for me and I repaid her for it. I have never run into something like this with an Amazon purchase. And I never could find out why they did this. Who orders just THREE of any china or glassware pattern?That said, the product was exactly as described; shipping and packaging were fine. Arrival was quick."
3,lenox Christmas mug.,"I gave this mug to 3 friends. I thought it was a terrif mug. I was disappointed that everyone treated it as a:""ho-hum"" gift and cast it aside."
4,Good shirt,"Good denim shirt. A slight crease along the waistline which is typically covered up when I tuck it in. Other than that, solid denim shirt."
2,Disappointing,"The authors explain in the beginning that they have health concerns about soy products and therefore use them sparingly. As far I as know, these concerns aren't widely shared, and the resulting underuse of soy makes many of the recipes far less satisfactory than they would otherwise be, since soy flour is by far the best low carb substitute for wheat flour. To avoid soy, they use ingredients such as bran that really change the character of recipes like pizza dough,. I did learn a few tricks. such as using almond flour, but overall the recipes were diappointing."
2,A waste of money,"I spent fourty-eight dollars buying all the odd ingredients for all the breads and desserts in this book (vital wheat gluten, whey soy powder, almond meal, etc.) and not a one of them were any good. The magic rolls, pizza crust and cookies all have a very mealy texture and tasted quite plane. They also made quite a mess of my kitchen."
3,Every recipe has dairy,"There are some useable recipes in this cookbook, but for someone sensitive to dairy it is almost useless. There are no suggested substitutions for dairy free cooking and believe me if you don't tolerate whey powder you will not like this book. Full of sour cream, whey powder, gluten etc. you will be in a world of hurt if you are like me who gets arthritis and rheumatic pain from these allergens.Nice try, MD's. Too bad you know next to nothing about alternative nutrition!"
5,Low-Term Strategy for Low-Carb Diet Success,"As anyone who has ever experimented with a low-carb diet has discovered, long-term dedication means long-term deprivation. This book will help you add back sin-free foods that help make the diet a life-long commitment. After the first flush of glee at being able to enjoy bacon and eggs, steak and hollandaise wears off, the typical low-carb follower suffers cravings for ""real"" foods. To stave off the urge to fall off the wagon, Solom has invented low-carb bread, noodles, pizza and tortillas! This book is unique in the realm of low-carb cookbooks. Anyone can write protein-laden main course recipes. This book is absolutely necessary for a balanced, satisfying low-carb life.The downside is (you knew there was one!), you've gotta cook. Perhaps no noodles without work is a good thing; it certainly limits dumping a box in boiling water and pigging out. The good part of it -- you know what's in your food because YOU put it there."
5,Great lowcarb cookbook- a must have,"I love this cookbook. Full of some fantastic recipes and mounds of information on low carb products. Try the chili recipe with black soybeans, I couldn't tell the difference from any original recipe using kidney or pinto beans. YA gotta have this one."
2,"""Magic Rolls"" a problem","Most of the interesting recipes in this book were based on ""Magic Rolls"", which contain white flour. White flour, sugar, and other highly processed foods are inappropriate for Atkins and have a significant effect on blood sugar, even if the carb count fits within your daily carb budget.The other recipes were boring, frankly, and relied heavily on thickeners such as guar and xanthan gum. If you are more interested in learning a new WOE than you are in trying to fake memories from your old WOE, then this isn't a good book for you."
5,"Amazing, revolutionary way of low-carb eating","I've been doing low-carb because I have insulin resistance issues. It's keeping my waistline down. But I thought I'd never be able to eat bread, pasta, and pizza again because of the potential health problems. Thank you, Eades and Solom! This book includes amazingly delicious and easy-to-prepare recipes that will keep my insulin in check and will keep me coming back for more. Yum!"
3,good but not the best,"Nice recipes and easy to follow, but lacks the humor of books by by Dana Carpender, She is an expert on low carb coooking, ned both!"
3,Good Companion if you are doing a modified Atkins Diet,"Get it for the magic rolls, Zuppa toscano and recipes involving peanuts. Recipes are tasty but sometimes time consuming. Book reads like a nutrition book with recipes. No pictures."
1,"No ""comfort food"" recipes in this book. I do NOT recommend.","Bought this book thinking there would be real comfort food recipes that were 'tweeked' into low carb. This book has stupid recipes - one called OSTRICH BURGERS that called for ostrich meat!??? Most of the ingredients are almost impossible to find at your grocery store. I'm quite surprised at the 4 & 5 star reviews (I think some are fake, perhaps from the publisher). I returned the book and got my money back (yes, the book was THAT bad). There were no ""comfort food"" recipes in this book. Save your money and don't buy it."
3,Best Clash Book????,"I bought this book on Joe Strummer's recommendation in a recent interview... but if this is the best book about the Clash then that is a shame... it is another one of those dry accounts by a ""bystander/not a writer"" who rifled through their diary and patched together a string of less-than-remarkable anecdotes until he had enough pages for a book.For someone who hung out with the Clash on a daily basis for several years I would have expected more insight into their personalities. Many of the ""stories"" related left me wondering why he thought that was interesting enough to mention.If you are a die-hard Clash fan you do get some snippets of insight into their day-to-day working methods while rehearsing for and recording the classics ""Give 'Em Enough Rope"" and ""London Calling"" but, beyond that, it is little more than another boring rock&roll; travelogue offering scant depth, details, or juice."
2,Makes the most exciting band in the world sound dull,"OK, ok, I've heard it a million times...being on the road with a band is only exciting for that one or two hours a night they're playing. BOY, does Green's book drive that point home! But, where a better story teller might have turned an account like this into a character study of some doubtlessly fascinatinating individuals (the band and its hangers-on), Green provides a series of dull anecdotes that don't seem to go anywhere or offer any real insight into the main characters. A big yawn by any standards, and a big disappointment for anyone looking for some insight into the Clash myth and legend."
1,Poor DVR Copy,"The movie was classic Penn & Teller, enjoyable up to the point where it would freeze up to and start to stutter.I've got a fairly new LG player that had never had a problem playing anything. I exchanged what I thought was a defective copy and found that the new disk did exactly the same thing. From reading the DvD and the packaging, I found that what I had was a DVR disk, not a DvD. For what ever reason, these disks did not want to operate right in my player. I'm not sure if the copies were defective, or if it was just the DVR format, but the product was junk. Wish they would have work, because I was enjoying the warped sense of humor of the movie itself."
2,you can't go back again,"I remember enjoying this when I saw it on cable as a kid. It was funny and weird. I bought this because I wanted to see if it held up and it is out of print on VHS and never released on DVD, so renting was out of the question. It does NOT hold up. Frankly, despite the ""quirk"", it's really rather boring."
1,Bad.,"I've always been a fan of Penn and Teller, but this was hard to watch. It wasn't funny and it just seemed to drag on forever. It feels like they overreached in trying to make a movie.It's not what they're best at."
4,psychotropic,"I have been thinking about this movie because I would love to be able to make something this gripping about myself. I don't do magic or attract an audience or fans like Penn and Teller. I'm glad this is on DVD, but I have not decided to buy it yet. I don't even have a camcorder to make my own movie yet. Going about things step by step is a far out trip if this is the best model I can come up with. I'm sure I saw this movie. Life has been downhill since then. I want to go back. I did a few crazy things in 1989. This movie was right for me in those times."
1,Penn & Teller should have stayed dead,"Don't get me wrong, I like Penn & Teller. But this movie really sucked! I bought this turkey at the 99cent store and frankly.....it wasn't worth the $0.99 + tax I paid for it."
5,Cult Moviemaking at it's finest!,"Penn and Teller are in top form, being the stars of their first movie (but hopefully not their last!) Of course, I AM biased, being a Penn and Teller groupie myself (and having met them before), but I wouldn't misdirect any of you... Love it. Love it. Love it!I've seen it 26 times. AND wrote out the entire script. By hand. Only took me 6 hours."
3,Average of 12 Out of 20,There are 12 months in the year and 20 Official James Bond films. 12 out of 20 isn't bad. That's 60 percent. 60 percent of 5 stars is 3 stars. That's about how I would rate this James Bond calendar. The photos of Grace Jones from A VIEW TO A KILL and Diana Rigg (with George Lazenby) from ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE look the best.
4,One of the Best Bond Calendars,"The ""Bond Girls 2006 Calendar: The Women of 007"" is one of the better ones. The balack & white photos from DR. NO, FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE, GOLDFINGER and DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER are outstanding. There is also a great color photograph of George Lazenby from ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE."
1,What can you do?,"All I can say is that this is an infuriating DVD because I think it was produced incompetently, with no regard for true fans of Clash music but at the same time has some rare footage and complete songs that are hard to turn down. Arrrgghh! Somebody please re-release this collection properly!"
1,Another incomplete cash-grab...,"There's some great stuff here, to be sure, but VERY few complete performances. Songs get thru two verses, then get jammed into some lousy graphics or a voice-over that gives no real input into what we're seeing. Why cut off ""White Man In Hammersmith"" two lines from the end? Why not have the full performances from The Tomorrow Show instead of chopping them off right before the climax? There's already a perfectly good Clash documentary out there (""Westway To The World"", highly recommended if you've not seen it), so the only real reason to pick this up is to see some new footage and hear how powerful the group's live performances were. And this doesn't achieve that. Hang on to your bootleg DVDs, your VHSs taped off late night TV, the clips downloaded from wherever... That's still (sadly) the only way to get the best of ""the only band that matter"".So in short, the tracklist looks good, but the product falls very flat. Only for the true completist. Sad, but true."
3,"...in your life, you like it well...","...I agree with many of the other reviewers here-much of this footage is available elsewhere, and there are some exclusions and omissions that are glaring.Most irritating, however, is the attempt to combine these performances into a cohesive documentary, through the use of voice-over narration over the beginning and end of each song. This is disruptive, as i was hoping for a ""video jukebox"" approach, lacking any need to cohere the material. Equally, the voice-over says things like ""London Calling-a double album, with the hidden track 'Train in Vain'""-obvious, uninteresting Clash 101 platitudes. I might not be so frustrated if the voice told me who played the keyboards on the last song, or other obscure factoids, something new and interesting for folks who already know, at the very least, who the band members are.So, while its great to see the new material, and to study it, this is a sadly capitalistically-minded package."
1,So disappointing -- A missed opportunity,"Every time I see this DVD in my collection I get angry! What a missed opportunity. There is so much great footage available out there but this eagerly awaited live DVD under-delivers in three ways:1 - Almost all of the clips are available elsewhere (there's nothing really new)2 - Don Letts has the cheek to include his own Tommy Gun clip which is lip-sync video not a live track3 - The voice-over is patronizing, dumb and annoying.What would have been great would've been a DVD which took ""Clash on Broadway"" as an inspiration and delivered a compilation with the same depth and integrity as that CD boxed set.Instead we get this very lazy cash-in.A real missed opportunity."
4,Not the Topper but still worth it.,"If you're a Clash fan trying to teach your children about what you listened to when you were their age, then this is the second vid to start with. Start out with ""Westway to the World"".After watching this with my daughter she now has some Clash on her ipod. We went for a drive the other day and she asked to listen to ""I fought the Law"". It made me want to cry.Buy it for the moments that count."
2,Aw Man!,"I was excited about this and looked forward to it.But, why cut off songs?Anyone who is into this wants to see complete songs.If you are patient and want to start somewhere great, track down the trading community DVD ""The Clash On TV Vol. 1"", before you pick this up.Don, I know you don't want to hear this - why did you not follow the track flow of ""The Clash On TV Vol. 1"" and release it official?The whole thing works so great.Thanks for your hard work on this - I really wanted to recommend it.Look forward to your next project."
3,Great advise for the single med student,"This book has great advise in it for the single med student. However, if you happen to be married and a parent most of the advise is far too time consuming and impractical."
4,Fans of Hollywood's Golden Era will love this..,Excellent biography. A fascinating story of a fascinating man. I wish the book were longer with even more details about this complex man who died so young. This book has definitely increased my appreciation for Ty Power's acting ability as well as for the large number of films he made in a career that was much too short.
2,Typical,"Service was fine, but the book was disappointing. I expected more of a personal story. This seemed just a rehashing of newspaper clips."
5,Tyrone Power:The Last Idol,"This book was exactly as stated. It was a first edition, the pages were clean, it didn't look like it had even been read. I would purchase from Aliza Mesbahi again."
5,An excellent reference work for the New Testament,"This is the second copy of this reference work I have owned. The first was destroyed by fire. This was also the first book I bought to replace my previous library. Bullinger does such a fine job at defining every word of the New Testament. The definitions presented will often provide the serious student with glimpses of insight that they could not get with any other work I have seen. The only thing better, other than talking to the Lord himself, would be talking one-on-one to Bullinger himself. This is definitely a 5 star book!"
5,Critical Concordance of the GreekNew Testaent,"This is an excellent biblical study aid, that along with other research tools gives greater insight into many Greek words in the New Testament, thereby giving a greater understanding of the rightly divided word of God."
3,OK for implementors,"If you want to implement a compression scheme fast easily, or to have general knowledge about compression algorithms this is a very good book. If you really want to deeply understand compression algorithms, to have some kind of insight about them, and to know about the best algorithms available today - this book is has less benefit (understatement)."
1,give us more information,searshing for books is very amazing in Amazone.com but i wish if we (customers )have more information about authers where do they teach; thier email andsome things like that so we could make our desecion
1,Waste of Money,"This video looks like a home video made by some proud mom who watched the ceremony!I was extremely disappointed in it (after having purchased The Silent Drill), and returned it to Amazon.com for a piddling $5.49 refund of the original $19.99 I paid! This is ridiculous and gives me pause for wonder about future purchases from Amazon!"
4,"Good 1000 stone, cuts well and is priced well.",This is a nice fast cutting stone. It is consistant and is just as easy to maintain as any other waterstone. It is priced well and lasts as long as most other 1000 grit waterstones.Overall a good value.
5,Great soundtrack.,"Love this soundtrack, one if not my favorite one beside Rambo first blood part II."
5,"AMAZING, EMOTIONAL, AND UNBELIEVABLE",Those words describe the movie and the soundtrack. I cried all over again listening to these songs that are so poignant and perfect for this movie. Be prepared for lots of Oscars! Buy this soundtrack!!!!!!!!!
5,One of the best Soundtracks of the year.,"Saving Private Ryan is one of the best soundtraks in recent history. It is so moving and sad that it is hard to listen too without feeling extreme remorse for those soldiers. In the soundtrack, my favorite song is The Last Battle. All of them are great and I say buy this C.D This week right here. You will not regret it."
4,Atypical Spielberg-Williams Collaboration,"Lots of horns, underscored by strings and supported by his 90's penchant for percussion, this is what you'd expect from John Williams- except that it's by far the most understated of his scores for a Spielberg film. You won't remember any music after you've seen the film- in part because its images are so powerful, but even moreso because of how music is used, which is *sparingly*. The music is not made up of motifs and cues, but of small suites bridged by overlapping horns. Williams only breaks from this pattern over the end credits, with the haunting 'Hymn For The Fallen', which is never heard in the actual body of the film."
4,Love the soundtrack for this movie!,"Who doesn't love a John Williams score? Didn't give it a 5 because the entire score isn't what I would consider one of his best, but still top notch."
4,Hymn to the Fallen,When I first heard this soundtrack I thought is was boring. But after I watched the movie a few times it caught on to me. Hymn to the Fallen is probably the most remembered song on the soundtrack because it makes me remember all the brave men who fought for our freedom. It also makes me wonder if I could be as brave as they were in a time where everyone seems to think they are the most important person than anyone else.
4,Excellent!,"Although the soundtrack by itself may be a little quiet, i liked it. Im glad that John Williams decided not to put in too much, otherwise it would have detracted from the movies raw power. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys good patriotic music. And pick up the medal of honor soundtrack as well!"
4,Thoughtful and Moving Music,"If you are hoping to find in the soundtrack to ""Saving Private Ryan"" a typical John Williams score, you will probably be disappointed. There is lacking here the excitement and fanfare of ""Star Wars"" or ""Jurassic Park"". If, however, you are looking for a subdued, restrained, and thoughtful collection of music, you will find all you could ever ask for in a motion picture soundtrack. In some films a superior musical score is forced to carry the burden of poor film-making; ""Private Ryan"" needed no such musical salvation, and Williams' score plays the perfect supporting role. It is intelligent and moving music, and if ""Hymn to the Fallen"" does not make you stand taller and walk more proudly as an American and a child or grandchild of a veteran, then you aren't paying attention!"
3,Good,"If you're looking for the Edith Piaf song that was used in the movie, it's not on this disc. The song is called Tu Es Partout and can be found on Pearl CD 7820."
4,Saving private Ryan,"This soundtrack is nice! If u like this one, I recommend getting the Band Of Brothers soundtrack as well! That one is one of my favorites!"
3,An Album Full Of Promise. But Fails To Develiver,When i saw the trailer the music they had which was from The American President another great soundtrack. I thought that the music used in the trailer worked better for those 3 minutes or so than the score it self. Despite the great track Hymn To The fallen which is very moving and powerful. But the rest just fails to develiver. I would buy this soundtrack mainly because of Hymn To The fallen. Revisiting Normandy was a good track but many of the others go on for to long and they jst don't move me like the movie.
2,Not what I expected from a John Williams Score,"Saving Private Ryan is slow, somber, and serene. I expected big musical flourishes. The good tracks are the ""Hymn To The Fallen"", ""Omaha Beach"", ""Defense Preparations"", and ""Hymn To The Fallen"" reprise. This CD is good to listen to while you read a book."
2,John Williams' worst score,"I was amazed by the movie at first, but now realize that it was a conventional war movie with fairly good acting and an unexceptional plot. The score is also average. It's not subtle, and it's not understated. It's just quiet. Too quiet. You never notice it and it doesn't add to the movie at all. If you want to see what John Williams can do, check out Star Wars. If you want a good World War II soundtrack, look at The Thin Red Line, a far superior movie in every possible way. And Life is Beautiful and Shakespeare in Love both have far, far better scores well deserving of the Oscars they received."
5,"This was written on 2004, still great on 2008","I really needed to learn Shaders, specially HLSL for XNA programming. So I searched and searched and this book kept on coming, but because of its published date I had my doubts. So at the end I gave it a try, and I am very happy I did.You will certainly learn about shaders with this book, and will be writing your own shaders very early. By using RenderMonkey as a Shader development platform you will focus on the HLSL instead of your gaming API. But it is very easy to port this samples and your creations to your own games.As I said, I have used this book to write shaders for my XNA games, even post processing ones. If you are a programmer trying to learn shaders, search no more."
3,Sufficient Info,"This booked gives me a mixed understanding. It has both good and bad qualities. The author tries to make shaders easy to understand for people who are not programmers. He is successful in this endeavor by outlining how to use Render Monkey. However the author often glosses over details, and it leaves holes in what you are trying unless you open up his accompanied shader. It makes it feel like cheating. Also due to the age of this book, some techniques outlined no longer work."
3,"Thanks, Mike","I know that whenever you buy a used book, you're likely to get one marked up by a previous owner. In this case, that owner was Mike. Thanks, Mike. You plastered your name and doodles over 50% of the book."
3,An Acceptable Anthology,"I'm not a literary scholar so I'm not going to comment on the selection of poetry or the quality of the introductions to poets. What I can say is that there are a ton of poets, introductions to each poet, and helpful footnotes for the poetry. The anthology appropriately reaches as far back as Walt Whitman."
2,You get what you pay for.,"Overall poor quality in craftsmanship. One can clearly see the glue that holds the gold trim in place, and on mine the trim on the handles was loose and could be easily removed. The wood is of subpar quality as well. The price is low; however, I would not recommend these swords."
1,Very old makeup,This make-up has been discontinued and you can not buy it in stores. The person selling this product is charging six times the price it cost when you could buy it in stores. Its very old and is not what I thought I was buying. I would not buy this product again. I would have to change make-up. It's a waste of hard earned money.
5,Very Nice Cables,"The product was as described. I used them to connect a dvd player to my receiver unit which then connects to the tv through an hdmi cable which I also bought through amazon. They work great! No crackling or interference. The gold connectors are assembled nicely, not cheaply made like some others I have seen. Worth the buy!"
3,AXIS 83202 Digital Component Video Cable (2 m),Look good on the picture but the material is a little bit cheap on the cable. The cable is very stiff.Should have bought the Belkin
4,AXIS 83202 Digital Component Video Cable (2 m),"A good inexpensive cable. It has good contacts and has good performance. Why pay more when you can save some ""cake"". Very happy with purchase."
5,"Like, far out, man !!","This is like Part 2 of ""Mad to be Saved,"" dealing with the beat generation in the movies. An amazing read.Highly recommended!"
3,USB is weak,"No bad. Solid construction. My main need, though, was to sit here in the basement and not go up to nuke my coffee in the microwave avery ten minutes to keep my sips warm. This promised to be able to keep warm from the USB connection. Not so -- not enough juice there, I guess -- at least from my laptop. In the car it was fine. And don't expect it to warm up your drink from a colder state. It will only maintain status quo."
1,Not Recommended,My wife and I each bought one of these and they both stopped working within 3 weeks.
2,"Works ok, reeks of plasticy-toxic odor","I tried this only at my laptop USB port at work and not the car cigarette lighter. It won't heat up your drink but it can keep it warm. I left it about 1/3 of the way filled and went to lunch. When I returned, my drink was reasonably hot. Well, very warm. In this aspect, I am satisfied with the perfomance.I have two complaints.The first is minor; the rim is very thick a akward to drink from.Because of the second, I no longer use it. The cup reeks of a foul, toxic-smelling odor that I just can't get past. It is one of odors where your brain says this is really bad stuff, consume it and die. I hand-washed it several times and left in the sun for a couple of days (as per a friends suggestion). This reduced the smell considerably, but not enough for me. It is now poisoning a land-fill somewhere."
5,best coffee mug,Love this item. Keeps my coffee warm for about 2.5 hours while I am sitting in class. The USB cord to keep it warm is awesome.
1,Great when it worked.,"My husband us confined to bed. He loved this mug and it kept his coffee warm for hours till he drank it. It only lasted a month, then stopped working. I have to order another. I can't find anything similar. Will order 2 and swap them back and forth. Perhaps having it on most of the time was too straining on it. Perfect when it worked. Both died in a few weeks."
3,Nice Mug- But don't drop it.,"I bought this heated travel mug and absolutely loved it. However, I dropped this mug from the cabinet this morning and the handle snapped off completely. I have only had it for about 3 weeks and have used it only 4-5 times. I have a laminate floor and the mug fell from about 7 feet. That seems to be within normal specs for a product to remain in one piece, right?!?!?"
1,Awful Mug,"This product is awful. The USB doesn't keep things worm even for few minutes. The previous feedback (which mislead me), which suggests to plug on and off to control overheating is completely baseless, and I think is provided with vested interest, as it's completely untrue. This Mug acts same as a basic Mug w/o USB or Car charger connection. Don't pay 3 times more for this."
1,Leaks - Unusable,"This was a gift for our son. His first sip resulted in a spill on his suit coat. Upon investigation, there is an actual gap in the fit of the lid. The cup is worthless and unusable."
4,A beautiful treatise on space and simplicity,"I loved this book. I think that anyone who is building or remodeling can benefit from these elegant, creative, warm designs that use space, light, and location so well. In an age where everyone is madly chasing after ""more, more, more,"" it's refreshing to see so many examples of how ""less is more""---when it's done right."
4,Almost as good as 25 houese under 2500 sq. ft.,"There were some interesting porjects but not like 25 houses under 2,500 sq. ft. Some really good detailing but also some that do not have the level of detail as the larger houses. Might be because of budget, not the house themselves."
3,"good stone, lousy packaging","I bought this stone to hone my straight razors, and after flattening the rough and uneven factory finish it works great to put the final edge on. However, the plastic container it came in was broken and was missing most of the rubber feet, so I cannot use it as a ""polishing station"" as stated in the description. At this price, you would think they wouldn't skimp on the little things...but you would be wrong."
5,Beautiful bowl,The bowl arrived in perfect condition - well-wrapped and not a scratch on it. My mother loves this bowl and enjoyed adding it to her collection. She used it immediatly upon receiving it for a Christmas dinner that evening.
2,A let down,"I had high hopes for this product after reading all the good reviews however, It was a huge let down. For starters it gave my dog a very upset stomach. Every time I gave my pit bull this it gave my dog the worst bubble guts. Her stool was very loose. After a month of use, I did not see any muscle gain what so ever. Be aware of this product."
4,K9 SUPER FUEL,"Amazing product I have used it for years both with dogs on a BARF diet and on Kibble. All my dogs are extremely active and this is a great boost/supplement for them.As for the company, they were great I screwed up and had the vitamins shipped to my old house on the wrong side of the country they dealt with it and got me the product as soon as they could."
5,Helpful with the basics,It is nice to finally find a book like this--one that explains basic math and chemistry principles together.
5,Great for students afraid of chemistry,A wonderful book that makes math and chemistry understandable for those who struggle with such subjects. The author makes the concepts concrete and interesting and can make math lovers out of anyone.
1,Disappointing,"I ordered this movie going off the other reviewers on Amazon and boy was I wrong. It was long, cheesy and just pure uninteresting. The casting was done well and Hritik and Sanjay really played their parts but that was the only saving grace.There was a song and dance number every-time you turned around. While they were mediocre in nature, they did not help advance the story line in any shape or form. The story itself is far fetched and is not fathomable by any stretch."
1,Subtitled in English? Not any English I've ever heard!,"The subtitles for Agneepath are why we hear so many caricatures of ""English""-speaking East Indians. The butchered language was one thing, but only about one-third of the movie actually had English subtitles. Most of the time the translator just decided not to do anything. I watch a lot of Bollywood movies, but this one was atrociously produced. Dharma productions? Eros Productions? I don't know which of them to avoid in the future."
4,Race and Latinos,Very provocative book--one of the few books I have seen that even mention Afro-Latinos and how race is _really_ seen in Latin America. Information like this makes it easier to participate in the race dialogue which has been made into a black-white issue for way too long.
4,Make interesting geometric pop-ups,"This is a wonderful book that will help older children & adults alike make interesting geometric pop-ups. Though the designs are complex & take some patience, they are definitely worth the effort.The book starts out by explaining fractals & teaching how to draw some of them. Ten card projects follow grouped from easiest to hardest. You are supposed to cut up the book, but you can make copies if you want.Clear, step-by-step instructions & a template are given for each card. Pages with printed patterns that can be cut & used to make the cards are also included. For each one, ideas to make the card fancier are shown.Making these cards truly brings a sense of accomplishment. They also make beautiful & unique gifts. I have given them to many friends and they have been very delighted & impressed."
2,Fram is poor quality,"The standard Fram oil filters are considered one of the poorest quality oil filters on the market. They have cardboard internal end caps and irregular filter medium held together by clips. These are constructed in Canada and quality control doesn't seem all that good. As someone else mentioned, go to YouTube and look up ""oil filter comparisons"" - you'll see how inferior Fram is compared to other brands. I used Fram for years, but will not buy any more after seeing these dramatic comparisons!"
4,Fram PH7317 Oil Filter,I received the oil filter several weeks ago. I haven't used the filter yet but it arrived in a short period of time and in excellent condition. It's the same type of filter I bought at Auto Zone six months ago for my 2006 Honda Ridgeline.
5,Like it!,"This provider shipped and we receive very quickly. Product came exactly as described. Especially like the ""extra grip"" that the tacky part on this filter provides."
3,It works.,the Orange filter works just fine. Would prefer a multipack instead of just one. Just want to complain the promised rebate never arrived.dont you hate rebates!!
1,Fram is Trash,Fram is trash. I have removed several fram products that were brand new and their removal and replacement with a WIX product fixed a drivability issue. please save yourself the trouble and get a WIX product like NAPA or well WIX.
1,It was my mistake,I can tell you that Buffalo AirStation WLA2-G54L wireless access point produced a strong signal. But it will not work with a Linksys router. I have intermixed Linksys and D-Link wireless products with no problem. But the Buffalo router would not work with my system. I now understand that many products do not interchange even though they use the same 802.11g standard.I was trying to connect a computer in another house about two hundred feet away without the expense of using external antennas. I was finally able to do so by using a Linksys WRT54GX2 router and Linksys WMP54GS Wireless-G PCI Card with SpeedBooster. I would think that the Buffalo router would have done the same thing if I had been using Buffalo products.
5,Another excellent camera from Creative Labs.,"I still use a Live Motion Camera from Creative and I purchased this Optia camera for my second system. It does work without any drivers, but most people will want to load the drivers for full functionality. With the latest drivers and software from the Creative site, the Optia camera produces excellent image quality especially for it's price point. The Optia is also very stylish and just looks good. The included software bundle and control software is very nice as well and includes lots of useful features. Highly recommended."
1,Don't be fooled - Needs drivers,"And once the drivers are installed and the camera is running the resolution is not at all impressive.30 days after you install the drivers a window pops up reminding you to register the product, even if you *did* already register it. Window will not go away and pops up every time you start the computer. Requires disabling some registry entries to make it go away.You get what you pay for."
3,webcam,I am having problems with my camera not comming through clearly. It was pixlating and then it was blurry. 73VF027000000. Bought one for my son and his family at the same time. They came through to me fine.
5,Great,"I bought this product for my grandson and it arrived in a timely fashion and worked great; he has communicated with this father, who is in Korea, and it worked wonderfully!!"
2,Waste of money,"Different people like different schemas of study.The one used in this book is the opposite of what I like: very little text, and a lot of tables instead. It might be somewhat useful for a quick review just before an exam, but definitely not for a thoughtful and profound study.Get some other book instead."
4,Great for third year surgery clerkship,"This book is light enough to carry with you in your white coat, and not too burdensome in terms of details. As with all Recall books this is written in question and answer format which works better for some people than for others. If you are interested in going into surgery, or feel that you like to have massive quantities of relevant knowledge at hand at all times during your rotations I would recommend instead the Mount Reid handbook which is packed with much more information and has a better index all for about the same weight. But for those students who wish to just learn the basics necessary to do well in surgery this book works well and highlights all of the essential information needed on the wards and in the shelf exam."
4,excellent book,"When Society Becomes an Adict goes beyond the usual books on addiction, to consider why addiction is so common in present society. Ms Schaef's observation is that society as a whole acts like an addicted individual. She also observes that the way to cure society is for the individuals in it to cure themselves.I must point out that the negative review by an ethics student must have been written after skimming the book. Had the student read more carefully, s/he would have seen that Ms Schaef admits that in an earlier book she had written that the flaws in society were basically the fault of the males in it. Since then, however, she has realized that addiction, not men, are to blame."
5,Awakened at last!,"This book and the others by Anne Wilson Schaef have helped me to put my own experience with family and society into a healthy perspective. I say, bravo to this lady and her work! Excellent! This work put me on the path to true emotional healing and understanding of why people act in harmful ways. I say, no less than brillant. Thanks Anne!! You Rock!"
4,handy unit,"attaches easily, inflates tires fairly quickly for small, portable unit. Do not trust the attached gauge for accurate reading (my unit is off by 5-7 pounds in 32-38psi range)-- use a quality tire gauge."
2,air auto compressor,can't say it's the best. isn't the worst either. don't think we'd buy another though.
5,Romance story that won't make you vomit,"In this volume of Video Girl Ai, Ai has been recalled by her creator, leaving Yota heartbroken since it happened just as they realized their feelings for each other. Now a few months have passed and Yota is in a new year of school. He soon meets Nobuko, a girl who has a big crush on him. He begins to warm up to her, but then Ai reappears! However, Ai can't remember Yota or anything about the time they spent together. As Yota tries to come to terms with his feelings for an amnesiac Ai and build a new relationship with Nobuko, you get sucked into a manga world of fabulous art, good dialogue, and great pacing. This is considered a boys romance manga in Japan, which sounded like an oxymoron to me at first, but I quickly gave up. This is no chickflick, with a sappy loser chasing a stupid girl. This is dramatic manga at it's best."
4,Jazz organist displays chops and diversity,"This 1993 effort from organist Greg Hatza displays chops and diversity. There are fresh arrangements of standards (""Georgia On My Mind"", ""Moment's Notice""), blues-based soul jazz (""Juicy"", ""Midnight Freight""), mainstream jazz (""Bossa Nowhere""), a smooth-jazz number (""From Me to You""), and a couple of funky fusion jams (""The Wizard"" and ""Tournament"") featuring fat guitar tones. Though the bandleader shows his chops on every tune, the sax players and the guitarist also get plenty of solo space, often alternating breaks with the organ to keep things interesting.Greg Hatza - Organ (Hammond), ProducerJim Snidero - Sax (Alto)Paul Bollenback - GuitarMajor Boyd - Sax (Soprano)Gary Jenkins - Drums"
2,Exhausting,"If it weren't for the poor writing, this could have been good! The errors of grammar were on every page - and no one is perfect. The editor, on the other hand, should have caught them. In several paragraphs of four or more sentences each sentence began with ""He"" or ""She"" and went on to declare something. The pacing was otherwise ponderous with some scenes gratuitous. A few passages had some thought, but all in all I came away exhausted and irritated at the poor use of the English language."
2,little disappointed,The product was exactly as represented and nice quality but they were too big for my mother to handle. I returned them without any problems.
2,Did not meet needs!,It ended not meeting my needs. I have the pasta bowl and the soup bowl from the set and they are not the same size. It appears that they are now the same size.
1,.,"the books were classic. the 1st movie was horrible. the 2nd a little better, just too much like a play and not a movie, the book on the movie was a major stretch. if you like the movies/game,read the books, all 10 plublished, then youll see how much of a joke it was to put the story into this format."
3,Books is kinda borring like the movie,"Ok first off, I love the origanl Dune movie, I think it was great, in fact I am waiting for the supposed three hour version simaler to the Sci-fi channels version of the movie they played about 5 or 6 years ago.The made for Tv version of the movie was awful. The acting was OK. But did you see the Cheesey back drops. I didnt beilve for one second that they were in a deserst. Yes it was more true to the book than Lynches version, but Lynch seemed to get the Harkkonnes on the nose, and in the TV version they seem, almost nice and tame in comparison.The DVD is pretty cool, but it showes even more how low budget and cheesy the tv version of the moive is"
3,"A good book with general facts, but not an in depth analysis",This book gives only a general description of bugging and the process involved. Although if you expected to start your own counter-measure agency this book doesn't explain how to do it. Recommended for novices as an overview of what's possible in the arts of eavesdropping on private telecommunications networks.
5,Consistent results across paper types,"I ordered PrintFIX PRO after changing to third party inks for my Epson R1800 printer. The colors were completely thrown off and I needed someway to create custom profiles that match the printer/ink/paper combination I use. A little research led me to this product. IT'S WORTH EVERY CENT I SPENT! It takes about 45 minutes to create a custom profile with a 225 patch target. I use 6 different papers, from super glossy to heavy weight cotton rag art paper. Except for surface texture, and the inherent color of each paper, the same picture printed on each paper looks identical. I never got results like this from the color profiles I installed from the paper manufacturers. If you're serious about consistent color reproduction, this is the way to go."
4,As always a great read,"As with all of Mr. Heinrichs other pieces of work, this book is very reaable, enjoyable and deserves a place on the shelf of any naturalist"
1,very confusing,I have been trading for 15 years. I have never read a book which is as confusing as this book!. Do not buy it.
3,Good,"I've read Profitable Patterns and his Diary so far, and would have to say this book is clearly the best of the three. Sadly though, one would have a tough time discerning the difference between the three books .. since they all present the same ideas and the titles of the books could be changed without anyone noticing. Typical Pesavento Gartley, Fib, Cycle stuff.. if this is a set up you use, then this would be worth reading."
3,Fibonacci Ratios With Pattern Recognition,This book is a jumbo of Fibonacci charts and of little assistance with the application of the Fibonacci ratio.
1,0023859321-2707427,"i SENT THE BOOK BACK IT DID NOT HAVE THE CD ROM DISK IT WAS SUPPOSE TO HAVE, HOPE I GET MY REFUND."
4,Hollywood Roses with Mick Taylor.,"It seems that Mick Taylor likes to record with the bands in the country where he is touring. I always buy these cds because they are a demonstration of his ability to play with any band, giving it a new and richer sound."
2,disappointed,"This was read near the end of the search, and had no new info. Many pages were dedicated to list of colleges and addresses--waste of paper. Some of the exerpted articles were quirky and enjoyable to read, but really not helpful. Very disappointed--going to used book store tomorrow."
1,Leaves much to be desired,"The premise of this book is good, but it fails miserably in its execution. There is little to no really useful information here. You could probably compile something close to this book simply by culling facts, quotes and descriptions from college web sites. An actual college student's perspective would have been more useful than Asher's. If you purchase this, you will absolutely be taken aback by the sheer volume of useless filler. Everything useful in this book could probably be reduced to 15 or 20 pages. Just take a look at the book's overspaced layout and you'll get the idea that even the author knows its failings. I urge you not to buy this."
2,"Not Bad, But Stick with the Color Model","You get much better resolution and viewing with the color camera, and there is no real improved low light capability in this model over the color model."
5,Great Intercom for the home,"This unit is exactly what I was looking for. Crystal clear sound, attractive, plus I wanted the flush mount for my Rec Room. Set up took a few tries to sync them up, but other than that if you don;t want an intercom that sounds like a ""fast food drive thru unit"" then these are for you.P.S. It's helpful to set the 2 units close to each other when syncing them up. That made it much easier. Then you can install them in the desired locations.Very pleased."
3,About what you'd expect from the price,"I did end up returning them, mostly because they are bigger than I thought, and could not imagine cutting holes for them. I did think that they worked OK when I tried them out, but the sound was not what I would call clear, more like a pair of motorola's about a mile away. Overall not a bad value for the price if it fits your need."
4,Absolutly amazing!,"I have never been this taken with any type of art before. I was flipping through channels when I saw one of these chandeliers on PBS, and sat in stunned amazement! This was the most beautiful glass making I had ever seen. Such an incredible mind this man has! All I can say is, I would like to travel to all these cities and see them up close, or I wish he would do them in Chicago!"
3,Why isn't this widescreen?,Why is criterion delivering a High Definition originated (read that 16x9 aspect ratio) presentation in a 4:3 aspect ratio?
2,Not much here!,"Unless you particularly enjoy reading about life in a commune, drugs, free love and what everyone is eating, you probably won't like this book. The characters were so strange that I couldn't really like them or care what happened to them. I thought about not finishing the book several times, but I decided to stick it out. There was no great revelation here for me.I can see, however, that people living this lifestyle or who are artists may enjoy the book more. There is a lot of banter about whether Banana Rose is motivated to paint or not..whether Gauguin can write songs or not..whether Anna can write stories or not...and so on."
3,Funny if you've ever heard Natalie read from her books,"I started this book before ever hearing Ms. Goldberg read from one of her books. I wanted to prepare for her visit to Spirit Rock Meditation Center and started Banana Rose. I had a hard time getting into it. I found that Banana was a bit of a whiner and the story seemed to go nowhere interesting. But when Ms. Goldberg gave a talk and read from her book, ""The Great Failure,"" suddenly her voice leaped out at me. Her phrasing and emphasis helped me see that where I earlier took Banana as a ""whiner,"" she was actually funny. She's a bit neurotic but if you can see what she says as more ironic and dry then it becomes funny. I enjoyed the remainder of the book once I could see the characters with Ms. Goldberg's voice."
1,blah,"I agree with the reviewer who said, ""This book reads like an adolescent's diary."" That's exactly what I told my husband. It's not worth the time, totally dull. Actually, an adolescent would be more emotional. It's like reading a poorly written soap opera."
1,Lousy writing from someone who's brilliant abt. writing,"I agree wholly with those who found this book a disappointment. It was laughably, appallingly bad --- self-indulgent, whiny, neither plot- nor character-driven. I just couldn't care about these flat people. Natalie G writes brilliantly about the process of writing; she should have followed her own advice, but also kicked in with some good hard self-editing. It's not that I don't know Taos or the Sixties, nor am I unsympathetic to books which probe the search for spiritual self and identity. I just found Banana Rose superficial and blah. I don't believe it ever would have been published without the authors' much-deserved success in other genres... and it shouldn't have been."
5,An all time favorite,"I have read this book twice and probably will read it again someday. I was very surprised at some of the bad reviews. Perhaps you have to know Taos to really appreciate the book. Having grown up in New Mexico I have visited Taos many times. While reading BR I can perfectly envision the scences of the plaza, Taos moutain, the gorge, etc. Taos is a very special, magical place, and I believe that having experienced Taos firsthand adds to the magic of the book. I found the characters incredibly real; I cried both times when Anna died. Yes Nell is a little dramatic/annoying, but that didn't make me enjoy the book any less. I can become completely lost in these characters' lives."
3,A soul seaching book,"I notice from reading the reviews, most of it was either love or hate! This is the first Goldberg book that I have read. After reading it, I gave it an okay or average grade. But for some reason the book has stayed with me. So there must have been more to it, then I gave it credit for. I am looking forward to reading a few more of her books as they were highly recommended. I think myself growing up in the Hippy era that Goldberg was writing about, made it easier for me to relate to some of the crazy feelings that were going on there. There was something about her style here that reminded me of Barbara Kingsglover but I just can't put a finger on it. It could have been Taos and the characters..."
1,"Heavy, not easy to open/close, bad customer service","Pros: takes less space in the car than a full-sizeCons: Heavy, ugly color, not easy to lower the backrest with the baby in the stroller. not easy to open (relatively easy to close), wheel locks too tight, very very bad customer service"
4,A very enjoyable read,"This is only the second book I have read in the Cedar River Daydreams series, but it has definitely left me wanting to read more. I feel that Lexi is a very likable main character because she honestly cares about not only her friends and family but also people that haven't been very nice to her. She looks for the good in people. In Jennifer's Secret, Lexi discovers that her best friend Jennifer always changes around school time, and she is determined to find out the reason why. Even though I figured out what Jennifer's problem was very early on in the book--a long time before Lexi did--I still greatly enjoyed the book. I think that Baer does a great job of exploring different issues that teenagers face. I also like the way she uses each book to focus on a different character. I think this book would appeal to anyone from upper grade school to high school or even beyond."
3,Move the tape recorder closer to the stage!,"An interesting artifact for gung-ho fans of this honky-tonk outfit (like me), but if you're a new Derailers listener/fan, stick with the studio LPs. Suffers from fidelity problems - muddy mix, inaudible (at times) vocals.Serves best as a change of pace when rotating frequently between Jackpot, Reverb Deluxe, and Full Western Dress.On the up side, there are a few songs here not found anywhere else and as the Derailers ascent continues this may become a valuable rarity."
3,Nicely Lo-Fi,"I bought this after reading an article in the newspaper on them and I like it. It's simple straight ahead country. It is a live-in-the-studio (radio station) album so it's not polished or professional, but that adds to the feeling.Highlights are the lead off track ""Big City Blues"", the joyful ""Jackpot"", ""I'll Catch You When You Fall"" and the rockabilly-ish ""Just One More Time."""
5,holiday bowl - lenox,This beautiful lenox bowl is big enough for serving and/or for show. Currently it is on display with poupourri...just great!!!
5,For the adult or young adult Vampire Hunters is a hit.,"Once again William Hill brings his characters to life. From the first page to the last you'll be riveted. This is Bills third trip into the realm of the vampire and I can't wait for the fourth, fifth, sixth....."
5,This book was totally cool.,This book had alot of drama and action. It introduces many new ways to kill a Vampire. There is no telling who the vampire is. Many seens had me think it was time to lose a charactor. It shows real life matters with totally off the wall stunts. It was easily one of my favorite books.
4,Great wit and satire!,"I first heard Mindy Jostyn about 6 months ago and I can't decide whether I enjoy her live performances or albums more. ""Cedar Lane"" is very representative of Mindy's work, poignant, funny, totally engaging. This is one album where you absolutely have to read the lyrics, as mindy pokes fun at ""Other guy's girls"", and growing up as a street kid in the 'burbs on ""Cedar Lane"". I thoroughly enjoyed it."
4,Mindy Jostyn Shows Us What She's Got,"Mindy Jostyn is one of those well-kept secrets of the music industry. She's been heard playing with Carly Simon, The Hooters, Billy Joel, John Mellencamp, Joe Jackson and dozens of others. You make have even seen her jamming with the band on TV's ""Emeril Live"". She has spent most of her musical career making others sound great. On this and her other solo albums, Mindy Steps out from the shadows to show us what she's got.First, Mindy is a very accomplished singer-songwriter. She's had the opportunity to work with some of the best and she shows us that she can hold her own with the best. As an instrumentalist, Mindy plays guitar, violin, accordion, mandolin and of course, harmonica. On the harmonica she proves that she's as good as any guy out there. The songs are all top-notch and the arranging is exquisite.I definitely urge you to take the time to give her a listen."
4,NOT TO BAD,THIS DVD HAS NO SPECIAL FEATURES BUT IT HAS ALL 17 EPISODES BY MAX AND DAVE FLEISCHER.IT ALSO HAS 5.1 SOUND AND FAR PICTUER FOR 4.98 ITS A GOOD BUY.
5,Inside Someone Else's Head,"I was fascinated with this book, as I was with ASHES. Each took me into the life and thoughts of someone I would never expect to identify with, and I was completely absorbed. I appreciated sharing the most mundane moments in first person with the principal character, as well as his high and low moments. In a way that Takeshi Kitano did with his early gangster films, I felt that I had been given an important insight into what it could really be like to be an artist.The characters were very interesting and complex, each with a mysterious history, and their interactions were highly unexpected right to the end. The plot moved forward in a logical manner, and the ending was satisfying, something I can't say for many Japanese novels I have read.Kitaka seems to be known as a crime writer, but crime didn't seem to be the main emphasis here. A good book!"
1,Don't waste your time,"Please do not read this book! You can find something else to spend your time and money on! I read the whole thing (kept hoping it would get better...) despite that fact that by halfway I was wondering, ""What is the point here?""The fact is, there never is a point and nothing important ever happens... except a terrorist bombing to a Manhatten Starbucks that comes out of nowhere and includes some very graphic and unnecessary gross descriptions of death and injuries. Could not feel the least bit sympathetic to any character no matter what her problem was and the mention of one socialite spending $10,000 on desiger duds for her young daughters just made me want to lose my lunch. This book is BORING and I'm still not sure if the author was trying to make us like or hate these people."
1,an unfortunate legacy,"I bought this book because I've read and enjoyed Wendy Wasserstein's plays and I knew it was her last work. Frankly, I wish she hadn't written it. Like many other reviewers, I was reminded of books like Hollywood Wives in the first half. Parodies of lifestyles of the super-rich, like most chick lit, have about exhausted themselves. Without more, it's like been there, done that. The second half of the book, if anything, was worse. Either someone else finished it for her, or she decided that everything in life was pointless and was going to illustrate that through each of the characters. Since it was difficult to care much what happened to any of these characters in the first place, I skimmed the last few chapters. Satire is the dark side of humor. It should be witty and thought-provoking. This book was just tiresome and hopefully she will be remembered for her other work."
3,Lives of the Rich and Brainless,"The problem with books like these is there's really no one to root for. Save Dr. Frankie, the rest of the cast is self-absorbed, poor-little-rich girls and boys. While it's amusing to watch their ""master of the universe"" antics, it also made me feel depressed and more than a little guilty that I was spending time on such vapid characters. All the same, it's nice to know that even the rich and ""perfect"" have the same insecurities as the rest of us mere mortals."
2,Reads like a Jackie Collins novel without the sex,I felt that this book was mediocre.I thought it would have more substance. You knew where the book was going twenty pages in. This would be a good book to read on the beach but it is not going to change your life
1,painful,"Full of painfully obvious cliches. I was insulted on so many levels I don't know where to begin.Save yourself the pain, run don't walk."
3,Not funny or fun,"Elements of Style follows the lives of several of New York's Upper East Side socialites and their families in the year following 9/11. The back cover calls this book a comedy and describes it as ""madcap"". I didn't think it was humorous at all. Most of the characters are selfish, vapid and materialistic (which I expected seeing as they are wealthy society people) but in a sad and pathetic way, not in a funny way. I expected this to be a fun, chick-lit book and was disappointed.I listened to the audio version of this book. The audio production was good and the narrator, Kathe Mazur, did a fine job."
2,Fun at first and then super depressing,"Very disappointing. At first it was a wonderful, witty, exciting read and commentary on NY. Then it became an unnecessarily depressing novel. I felt the extreme dichotomy was not warranted."
2,Bored to tears!,"Oh boy. I wish I didn't have to finish every book. It is just a pet peeve of mine. However, I couldn't get into this book. I see no clear theme. I know everyone was horrified at 9/11, however the theme went throughout the book and made the book even worse. What happens to all the characters? One is blown up in a maybe terrorist attack on Starbucks? Another one goes back to her husband. One runs into a tree while skiing and dies. Frankie wanders the city trying to hold onto her dad. Jeez, I was really hoping to like this book, but I just am relieved it is over."
1,A Pretentious Mess,"This book about the shallow, pretentious, loathsome super rich in Manhattan is, in itself, equally shallow and pretentious. A bitter chore to read and impossible to finish."
3,BEST OF THE LOT,"I enjoyed this edition better than the previous ones, as its a self-contained story. Here, we meet Jubei's gender nuetral arch-rival, who wants to put Jubei out of business forever.Jubei shows his true character strengths by relying on his self-confidence (and his friends) when all else fails, and that seems to be Jubei's strongest aspect. The characters he comes across throughout the series gets more interesting-including a woman who controls spiders to spy!You can read this single volume without having read the other 2. Hey, you can always go back after reading this one."
5,Made my life easier,I have all kinds of different audio coming out of my computer. Music I play in my room. Sound going to a monitor. Sound going over to the TV in the living room. Sound transmitted to another room. So I bought an audio splitter which outputs to quarter inch plugs and I needed these to convert it. I bought 4 and they all worked great.
1,How to Make A Buck Off Of the Credulous,"Start with a carnival barker / infomercial-style host. Take a couple of camera shots of Rupert Sheldrake staring into a microscope for no apparent reason. Throw in some 'actual footage' from the Scole Experiments. Then toss in a lot of simulated footage and actual audio coupled with simulated images overlaid onto 'actual video'.Start flipping back and forth between actual and simulated states so frequently that the viewer looses track of which is which, then wrap it all up in a cheesy tabloid style package, and you'll have a movie called the Afterlife Investigations.The best thing I can say about this decidedly unscientific endeavor is that it might be worth a $1.99 rental on a rainy afternoon, but I wouldn't buy it to keep around the house. Someone I respect might come by one day and see me with it. :-)"
3,"Worth a look, but don't expect too much.","The film is very amateurish, so don't expect top-notch editing or narration. In fact, the narrator reminded me vaguely of Robin Leach. Some people won't be convinced by any film for any reason, even if it is narrated by Morgan Freeman and directed by Clint Eastwood. Others would believe absolutely anything with little to no evidence. If you're somewhere in the middle, have an open mind, and don't mind low-budget production, you might find this film interesting."
5,truly amazing!,"I was completely astonished at the irrefutable evidence that this team of paranormal investigators have found! After watching this documentary, I ""KNOW"" that we DO have a soul, and it DOES live on after death! It's only natural, in a sense, because we, as human beings, have that strong desire to live. So, why would it be improbable to believe that the will to survive doesn't stay intact after death? Many people will remain skeptical, but once you watch this particular documentary, even the most die-hard skeptic will scratch their head and ponder the thought and say, hmm, maybe...maybe..."
1,Lacking...,"I do have a belief in the afterlife, but this video will not convince anyone. The fact that no video cameras were used during the sessions makes me think ""phoney""."
1,OK for surfing the internet but if you want to stream or download anything forget it,If all you want to do is surf the internet or check e-mail it's probably fine. If you ever need to download something wrap the adapter in ice first because after 50 Mb or so it will overheat and kill your connection.
2,"When it's good, it's very good, but when it's bad, it's rotten","worked great for the first couple of months, and then it just died. Tried it on other computers with no luck. Also, range is very poor, so if you need the wireless access at a distance of more than 10-15 feet from the router, get something else."
1,"Stay far, far away","It disconnects constantly, 4-5 times per day, and gets very hot. Looking around online, I'm not the only one with these problems. I called support, and they claimed it was my router. I explained that that was rather interesting, since at least 4 other devices in the house stay connected with no trouble at all. They escalated to 2nd tier support, which advised me to return it to the store and get a different kind (!) when they were told of the reviews I read. On hearing it was past the return policy (it was purchased near Christmas, I was too busy to worry about wifi issues then), they want me to ship it back to them, at my expense. Avoid it like the plague. It simply doesn't work. Some reviewers say it works ""well enough"" for simple web browsing. Sometimes, perhaps it does. But why buy a product that only works ""well enough"" for casual use when you can get one that works -right- for the same or less money?"
1,Don't Buy DLINK WUA-2340! It's horrible!,"I bought this wireless adapter because we bought two stories condo, so we need some kind of wireless internet access. It looks very sharp and cool, but the quality is horrible, it is LOADED with bugs!First of all, when I tried to run it, it will give me the blue screen of death every 5 to 10 minutes. a5agu.sys system crashed! I tried to call D-Link customer support and after a long wait and transfer, The tech support was unable to fix the problem and D-Link customer service refused to replace the broken adapter!!!They are the worst technical support in the world, they are rude and they don't have a clue of what they are doing.I trashed the DLINK WUA-2340 in the trash and went ahead and bought a Belkin wireless adapter and the Belkin works great on Windows XP!AVOID D-LINK and buy BELKIN!"
3,This adapter works...,"This adapter works... period.Some minor niggles are that it can be a bit slow when downloading and I seem to loose my connection every intermitently during a download. I am sure there are better adapters out there, but for the price, I'm not complaining..."
1,No improvement over normal G.,"I ""upgraded"" from a D-Link G router and adaptor to the D-Link RangeBooster G equivilent in hopes of improving the very marginal signal. There was no difference. I have now upgraded to ""N"" and it is good - but not great."
4,Has worked well so far,"I've had this product for a few days. It has a long USB cord, which leads to a desktop holder, into which you can place the adapter if you like, which is nice as my USB jacks were almost full and it would have been hard to plug this device in directly. I had tried a Linksys adapter, (I use a Linksys wirelss access point) but it did not work on this HP mini desktop (win XP). The PC also has a built-in wireless card which is pretty bad, won't hold a connection. Esp. if I don't broadcast SSID on the router. Whereas this D-Link, installation was super fast, and after connecting, I stopped broadcasting SSID. It stopped connecting, but I was quickly able to reconnect and since then its worked fine. I use it at work, with a connect-sensitive program, and so far its worked well. Will have to see whether it fails me in 2 months like others have said. But so far I think highly of this adapter."
4,Don't understand the negative reviews,"I used this USB adapter for about 18 months with no problems. Took it out of the box, plugged it in, and it connected to my Netgear wireless router. Communications devices are not universally plug-and-play. You will run into compatibility issues sometimes."
2,Wish I had read these reviews,"So, I bought this at Target for 50 bucks. The first couple of months, it worked great. Then, it became a pain to deal with. I noticed that when it gets really hot, it stops working (the blinking light stops). I have to let it cool down and then try up to 10-15 times by taking it and in and out of the USB to make it work again. I dont recommend this product, spend a little more and get something that isnt a headache."
4,Home WLAN,"Works as advertized. Of course it will only work as good as your access point. I am using a Kyocera KR-1 in conjunction with a Novatel mobile broadband device. The KR-1's 802.11 signal is extremely weak, barely penetrating a standard residential wall. So, I needed a powerful USB type 802.11 device on the workstation and the D-Link delivers."
3,"Fast, Cheap, Okay.",I already have very slow internet (dload speed capped at about 120kb/s) so I did not need a very expensive adapter. The range on it is not very good forcing me to use the USB extender that comes with it so I can put it on top of a shelf.
2,Just not enough,Was kind of hoping this would boost my wifi range more than the wireless card organic on my laptop. This product provides less signal strength that what's already on the laptop. Would be okay for someone who doesn't have a wifi card however doesn't work for my uses.
2,It works... but its range isn't good.,"I installed this product and it worked but its range was not good. I used my laptop in the same area and i had all bars. The computer using this had 2 or 3 bars. (It changed constantly). I wouldn't recommend this if you are more than a room per floor away from your router, if you are more than a room away get another wireless adapter and save yourself the money."
2,"Works with SOME PS3 games, does NOT work with PS2 games","I bought my PS3 after breaking my PS2 since it was advertised as ""back compatible"" and such, I bought 3 of this adapters so that I can use my old PS2 controllers too, turns out my old PS2 controllers works with certain games, such as Virtual Tennis 3, no problem there playing 4 people doubles. I also have Virtual Fighters 5, which this adapter does NOT work correctly, the punch/kick/block buttons work but the direction pad is not responding at all. I tried to play some of my old PS2 games and this adapter will NOT work with any of those, including DDR and Guitar Hero. Overall it's not worth the money, I wish I hadn't bought all 3 at the same time, would've saved me about $15."
1,ps2 to ps3 adapter,ps2 to ps3 adapter didn't work on guitar hero 3 all the way after song starts once i hit yellow note it would freeze.notes lit up and was able to play a few notes then freezes.had to use both ps3 controller to start game and then guitar /gh3 game. i hope it would of work disapointed it did not.ps2 controller worked fine.not worth the time and headache to get it to start.
2,OK with Problems,"I agree somewhat with all the reviews. I recently got PS3 and still wanted to play guitar hero. This was the sole purchase of these adapters. Unfortunately, it does not play the same, which doesn't make sense. Pushing select for star power sucks. Also, doesn't work all that great in game play with the strumming and not being able to carry the note through the same strum. Why it can't work exactly the same is retarded.Do these work on the guitar hero games for PS3 or no? I have buy another guitar or 2 for $60 each?Unfortunate that these things don't work perfectly. I'm not going to return them, but they don't work like you would think."
1,Doesn't seem to work.,"I got it, it doesn't work. The PS3 requires a little PS Button to be pressed to register controllers, this doesn't have one. You can't play Guitar Hero with it, you can't do anything. Maybe it would hook a controller to you computer."
2,Not for learning Spanish,"This is NOT a CD for learning Spanish--either for you or your baby.It is marketed as a bilingual Spanish-English CD. What you should know before you buy this CD, however, is that the narration and all of the songs on the CD are in English, with an occasional word of Spanish thrown in. At the end of each music track, there are a handful of words spoken in English, then repeated in Spanish (for example, at the end of the first track: Hello--Hola; Here I am--Aqui estoy). If you want to learn 20 words in Spanish, the bilingual aspect may have some appeal.I would give this CD zero stars, because I believe the ""Spanish"" label is misleading. However, I give it two stars for the music because, while I find the songs irritating, others might find them soothing for the baby. I believe each of the songs is original, so if you're tired of the basic lullabies, these might appeal to you."
5,Excellent Impression of Shipping and Service,"I was very impressed with the time that it took Amazon to ship this item. I placed my order on a Friday, and I received my item the following Monday. This was with the super saver shipping! Thanks Amazon for amazing service as always. I will continue to be loyal in purchasing items from you and your sellers."
1,Cheap clear plastic!,"This item is not as pictured--it is clear, thin plastic not heavy-duty, dark plastic as pictured! Cheap junk!!"
4,A hilarious story; a classic western.,"This is the book stereotypical western characters are based upon. The confident, dry witted, two-gun slinging hero, the old barkeep, the occasionally incompetent rustlers, and their no-nonsense leader; it's all there. A perfect western, and a quick read. The dialog had me rolling."
5,Loose Diamonds in the Rough,"Loose Diamonds was one of America's great lost bands. In a just world these guys would be famous but, alas, they are simpley another unknown band that made great music. Fortunately Troy Campbell is still putting out great records (if you can find them). This acoustic set is as good as their more rocking electric stuff. ""Burnning Daylight"", their first CD falls somewhere between Tom Petty and the Outlaws (with the addition of a couple of country ballads). All of their stuff is worth searching for."
2,Disappointing,"A disappointing read after his other books. In this volume, Ken Wilbur rambles on, and on more than one occassion the read becomes a bore. In addition, he falls prey to criticisms he levels at other authors; in particular, relating to magic, which for many occultsts (like myself) is followed for spiritual reasons."
3,Overload!!! Where to start? There are so many!,"Wow, they all look good. Wow, I see problems in each. Wow, I don't know what I am doing here, I am a fish out of water in the franchising world. I found this book to be a good tool to have once you have found the businesses you want to investigate. The challenge is narrowing the list.I didn't want to stand behind a counter making sandwiches(spent too long in corporate America for that), but beyond that I didn't know what else to narrow the list on. I found some help and between this book, others books and the advisor I found I was able to evalaute the market. Some investigation, and Google, led me to George Knauf and together we talked about companies, my goals and what is in the book.Use all the tools available to you. I found the book to be a somewhat worthwhile investment and the advice to be worth a great deal, though somehow it din't cost me anything."
1,I could have saved the money.,"This product is supposed to clean and even repair small imperfections on your CDs.I used it several times on brand new CDs and old CDs.It does clean indeed the fingerprints and dirt on CD's surface.For the ""repair"" part, I did not see any improvement - same scratches as before using it.The upsetting part was when using it on new CDs, to remove possible fingerprints.The fingerprints were removed, but the CD surface lost the ""new"" quality ( the shiny, mirror like look). It had tiny, tiny lines, non-removable.The process of cleaning/ repairing involved also some preparation, i.e. time, and consumables, i.e. money.All being said, the product is now resting on a shelf, and I returned to cleaning CDs with the old, verified, manual method ( soap, water, clean cloth, sometimes rubbing alcohol). I obtain excellent results, faster.I do not recommend this product."
3,Pure EGCG is better,"It somewhat curbs appetite, but I've found straight EGCG to be better for both this and elevated energy. This product also mildly upsets my stomach whether empty or full. There is a list of other ingredients in this pill, which do help elevate metabolism, but the mg is not mentioned for those. I'm not sure if it's any of those ingredients upsetting my stomach or if it's some filler. I'm going to stick with things that actually tell you how many mgs there are of each item in it. 'Propreitary blend' can be anything. Also with EGCG, look for the actual mgs, not just the percentage since that could mean many different things as well!"
4,Found it for $3,"Just letting you all know that I found basically the same thing for about $3 at target. It was with the vitamins. The brand is ""Origin"" and it's called ""Green Tea with Hoodia"". It's labeled as a dietary supplement and there are 60 capsules in the bottle. Directions: take two capsules twice daily, preferably with meals. Capsules may be opened ad prepared as a tea.-I thought the fact that you can make tea with it is an even bigger plus! Together, two capsules have 655mg of Green Tea Hoodiea complex=Green Tea Extract(camelia sinensis-leaf)+Hoodia Gordonii(leaf).I hope this helps! Paying almost $3 is way worth trying to see if it works for you, it works for me!"
2,Mega-T Green Tea Weight Loss Supplement with Hoodia,The product was sent to me on time!! I have been taking this product for two weeks and I haven't seen any difference but over all amazon did their job by sending me this product on time!
2,gives you a short burst of energy,i have been taking this and have lost no weight at alli am alert for a whilei have never been one to eat much at all so appetite was not the problem just gained weight stomach etc for no reason i exercise on a machine i'm on less than 1000 calorie diet healthy foods still weight is herei give it to stars because with that short burst of energy at least i get a little bit of work done around the house good luck peoplemy normal weight 120 lbs out of the blue got up to 151 no reason i work out on exercise machine tells u how many fat cals you burn have to burn those first to get rid of the real fat so if you find something that will get rid of belly fat let me know cause i eat very little take these pills and nothing
5,Finally!,"It's about time! In all the years I've been dealing with children, I have never found a book that explains childrens' behavior in such a clear and understanding way.The book takes you through a number of chapters, each dealing with a different aspect of behavior. Bilmes does a wonderful job illustrating these in a clear manner while providing the reader with charts and tables.My favorite part is that she is understandable. She doesn't try confusing the reader with ""big words."" She gets to the point and the point gets to you. You don't need to read and reread sentences to decode them, which I found very helpful.I could not be happier to have purchased this book. It is a lifesaver in the classroom.Stephanie Anderson- California"
5,Beyond Behavior Management,"I needed this book immediately--it came on the day expected, in perfect condition. Not only was the book in perfect shape, it is one of the best early childhood resource books I've read."
5,My Favorite Georgina Gentry Book,I have read this book three times. I just love the chemistry between these two magnificent characters.
4,a great look at the past history of wrestlemania,"The matches on this card and the wrestle maina their from are:- Hulk Hogan and Mr. T Vs paul Orndorff and Roddy Piper (wrestle maina)1- Battle royal (wrestlemaina II)- the final of a world title tournament(wrestle maina IV)- Andre the giant vs Jake ""the snake"" Roberts (wrestle maina V)- Macho man Randy Savage vs The Utlimate warrior Reterment match (wrestle maina VII"
5,Simply the best DTP program out there...,"As a Graphic Designer I can honestly tell you that Quark is the choice to go for if you plan to foray into the professional world of advertising and media. Quite simply, EVERYONE USES IT.I can guarantee that just about every professional designer out there does their layouts and publications in this program, every magazine, newspaper, billboard, flyer all the way to CD & DVD covers, are done in this program.In this edition, Quark has thoughtfully added a bunch of features which gives a few less headaches to worry about, like the addition of bezier lines, freehand lines, the ability to fit text to path (no longer limited to straight lines only).Also you have Quarks continued ease-of-use and simple, easy to follow menus, commands and options. Even a new user should be able to master the basics within a couple of hours of use.If you are a new-time designer or want to upgrade your old software then I definately recommend this program."
4,Fine and varied swan song for Seals,"This disc (Seals' last before his 2001 death) features more variety than his Alligator albums. ""Dear Son"", on what sounds like a 12 string acoustic guitar (with an electric solo), is a tale of a mother leaving her family to be ""movin' on"" with another man. ""Funky B--ch"" is a burner in the Albert Collins mode,(with Al Kooper on organ. ""Osceola Rock"" is a sort of rewrite of Elvis' ""Jailhouse Rock"", with massive backbeat by drummer James Wormworth. ""Bad Blood"" is a strange collaboration with a crime novelist, featuring Seals dueling with Jimmy Vivino on guitars, and a horn section, including Vivino's brother Jerry on sax. There's funk on ""Blues Holy Ghost"", and humor on ""Hair Of A Frog"". Over an hour, and one of Seals' best-well recommended. I also recommend his Alligator discs ""Spontaneous Combustion live"" from 1996, and ""Bad Axe"", from 1984. His most popular tunes from 1972 to '96 are found on the ""Deluxe Edition""."
5,letting go of alligator chains,Son finally has made the album he always wanted no holds barred . The band behind him is the best ever including legend al kooper on keyboard and jimmy vivino on guitar.I watched son perform LET IT GO the title track on late nite witn conan obrien and he brought the house down.That track alone is worth the price of the cd.also how rare is ablues album with all original songs not even eric and bb had the guts to do that.Son proves that blus music can be progressiveI
3,Holiday Treasury - Christine Feehan,"All of the stories have been in print before so if you are a die hard fan, you have them already! If you must have everything, I'd say go ahead and buy it otherwise check your bookshelves first!"
3,"Great lessons for some, old news for others","I like this book because it states over and over to be completely yourself and it doesn't matter if you are the shyest person on the planet or the most outgoing. It is also matter-of-fact and straight up tells you what men want and don't want. Men in a bar setting are after only one thing and when they get it, us women should not expect anything more. However, if you are a woman who knows how to work it and is not insecure, don't waste your time. Only read this if you are clueless, anxious, or unconfident while at a bar. My best friend and I, both frequent bar-goers and huge flirts, read this book and found only a few pages with advice that was actually new and useful. Other that those, we basically knew all the other stuff."
1,Like selling ice to eskimos,"this book is fine, but seriously--a book on how a woman can go to bars and land a man??? the answer, ladies is in the question: go to bars--the men will most likely take it from there. (it helps if you're hot). i have an idea, to test the efficacy of this book: go to a bar--like employees only--and take a look around and note how many women (again, being attractive helps) are standing around alone and unnoticed. my guess is they have a drink in one hand and pepper spray in the other. i suppose the point of this book is to ""teach"" women how to ""get"" the man they want, but really, anyone with a modicum of social intelligence knows that women usually get the man they want (or at least deserve)--it's men who need a clue as to how to speak to/pick up women. maybe next these authors can pen a book detailing the best way for fat people to gain weight."
1,Agree 100% with the reviewer below,"This used to be the very best product on the market...don't know how many bottles I used over the years. But the folks at Anthony changed the ""recipe"" and now it smells just as the reviewer below states...like burnt plastic...rancid. I'm told this item has now been discontinued, so if you happen to run across a bottle that is very clearly blue, buy it. But if it's lighter blue in color and has a slight green tint to it, don't bother."
3,Decent Treatment,"Razor Burn Repair from Anthony is not great, but it isn't terrible either. It really doesn't do anything more than normal moisturizer except it provides more of a cooling sensation for really bad razor burn. It helps, but doesn't make redness or swelling disappear altogether. The scent is pretty good, but not as good as the rest of the Anthony line."
4,A Must Have!,"This is a very strong steel bracket. It comes with all the needed hardware (bolts) to mount your Culligan HD-950A water filter. My only complaint is that this bracket should come with the water filter (minus one star). The water filter is too large to use without support. Some people will place an object underneath the filter to hold it up. The only problem with that is when you change the water filter, you are putting undesirable pressure and stress on your water line and fittings as you unscrew the bottom. That's why you need this bracket if you own a Culligan HD-950A water filter. It may also work with similar sized water filters as well."
1,i was sent wrong bracket by seller,"yes, i know my review is really late, but i just now tried to install this bracket...i had originally bought it nearly a year ago, but never got around to installing it, as i didn't feel like removing hosing from tankless water heater...but today, during yearly maintenance i tried to install it, and found it didn't fit, i was sent the wrong bracket, i was very disappointed..."
5,Tells of Gustav's musical life from infancy to adulthood.,"I am a music teacher and absolutly love this book! While it can be shared with almost any primary class, I saved it for my second graders and used it with the cassette. The story tells of Gustav's musical life from infancy to adulthood. On a quest to find his ""musical self"" he discovers jazz, classical, big band music and much more. Following the story, we play a game that I developed using segments from the cassette. My students had a great time identifying the different instruments played in the story. I would recommend this book and cassette to all! Enjoy!"
2,badly written,"this book contains a few gems, mostly from Chomsky, but the authors write very bad english!"
1,My kids are scared!,"The kindergarten teacher at my 5 year olds school read this story in the middle of the year. It is now July 24th and 10:00 pm and my 5 year old is crying, sitting on my lap, and afraid that the ankle-grabber is under her bed. She's never been afraid of anything before.This is a horrible book. Another parent has had to put her daughters mattress on the floor in an attempt to remove the ankle-grabber swamp.Do not let your children read this book unless you want your child sleeping in your bed every night, or making excuses not to go to bed.There is no reason to create fear in our children."
1,Fails at its attempt to comfort kids,This book scared the bejeebers out of my son for YEARS. He hadnightmares over this one - and it was supposed to do the exact opposite.Totally don't recommend it!
5,How Wrong SLJ's Review Is!,"Don't you think it's funny how dead wrong the School Library Journal review is, especially since they should know kids. Ah, well. This book is very scary, because it preys on a fear I haven't seen addressed anywhere else but is one of the most common (at least I have it and most kids I knew did). I will say that another book in the same series, ""The Flat Man"", is even scarier. It scared my daughter to death and she still remembers it fondly. I'm ordering both for my library. Every child deserves to be scared witless."
1,scared my child for months,My nearly 7 year old was read this at school a year ago & just last week & both times have caused endless tears & fears at bedtime. NOT a good book for a sensitive child with an active imagination.
5,"Essential Must Have for Every Writer, Publisher or Marketing Expert",Don't let the original publication date be of any concern...this book is as timely today as ever...maybe more so than ever given the proliferation of aburdity and the need to speak to a client in less time than ever. Bodian's works are a gold mine of info. Do yourself a favor and get your hands on any of them possible. I have and haven't regretted it a bit. Absolutely fantastic information. No fluff. Solid facts and full of specifics.
