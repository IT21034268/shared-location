1,Bad Product,"I had similar problems to the other reviewers. It's almost impossible to get the image lined up onto the label properly. The software comes with a calibrator but it did not solve the problem. No matter how it's calibrated it prints off-center. After spending hours creating the DVD movie, I expect the ability to print a label or case cover to be relatively simple, or at least to work as documented. This product fails in that respect and it's not worth my time to troubleshoot it.Also, the software is somewhat hokey. It isn't even written with a standard Windows interface so it's not as intuitive as I would expect. They created their own user interface so when you are trying to browse to find a file, the interface seems foreign, making it hard to use.Don't waste your money on this product. I'm heading to Best Buy tomorrow to return mine."
1,Terrible,"This software is horrible, and the actual lables are even worse. I put one of the memorex lables on to a cd i just made and i used the lablel applicator to put on the lables. I pressed as hard as i can to make sure the label was sticking on to the cd. I played the cd in my car, no problem, but when i went to eject the disk, the disk would not come out because part of label got stuck in the machine. I managed to get it out with a tweeser but part of the label is still stuck in there and i cant play any cd's. This program is not user friendly at all and features are very limited. You are much better going with neato or avery software."
2,Non-user friendly program,Labels are label applicator are ok.The program is very difficult to manipulate.Got a different program and works fine.
1,Aggravating! Endless problems! Totally worthless!,"Will not print on my HP 3210. After a while, the drop-down menus appear blank--trying to save the hard work is impossible! Does not allow me to open ANY of the picture files in my computer to copy images--I have to go through several steps, copy and paste, copy and paste, via a MEMORY STICK!... One star is one too many."
5,The Embroidery Stitch Bible,"This is the book for the needleworker who wants to learn more about specific stitches, or who just enjoys reveling in the joy of needlework. Beautiful color photos and illustrations on dozens and dozens of stitches, plus photos of categories of stitches. Beautifully researched and printed entirely in color."
1,Bad construction,"The horizontal arm swivel connection is a complete desaster. There is no way to ever make it really fixed, however strong I make the wing bolt. With the weight of the mic, the arm always starts to slowly falling down. I even tried to improve it by using special rings between the axis screws, no luck so far."
5,Very nice,"I'm very pleased with this product. I'm using it to hold my iPad, two microphones and a bottle stand in my studio. Seems to be substantially built and very stable."
3,Looks like a naked baby,I got some dinosaur figures for my birthday. I decided to get this one. I thought it was going to be much bigger and lighter than it was. It is dark like a baby and small like one. I just gave it to my mom. I got the carnegie diplodocus instead.
4,cute but small,"We looked all over for a Stigmaloch (sp) and found this. It is cute, well made, and durable. Very lifelike. No visible seams like the cheaper toys, but this one came with a hefty price tag for about a 5inch toy. My son loves it though so it was worth it... I guess"
5,Lovely little model of a favorite dinosaur,"Pachycephalosaurus has been my preschooler's favorite dinosaur ever since he heard the They Might Be Giants song, ""I Am a Paleontologist."" And this is the best little Pachycephalosaurus model we've found so far. We love the coloration, the detail, and the expression on this guy's face. Between this wonderful Pachycephalosaurus and their equally wonderful Styracosaurus, Papo has become our favorite source for dinosaur figures, beating out even Schleich (which tends toward the conservative and old-fashioned).Still, we were surprised that some parts -- namely, the hands and arms -- are flexible. This was a plus for my son, who gets to pose the dino to an extent, but a minus for me, who's worrying about what exactly was added to the PVC to make it so plasticky. (PVC is never good, but let's be honest, the wooden, rubber, and soft dinosaur models out there are just not as naturalistic/scientific.)"
4,"A fun, diverse little introduction","Despite its claim and the claims of previous amazon.com reviewers, Katzner's book offers only the tiniest of insights into the vast store of languages covered. Almost no entry goes beyond simply phonetics, and there is little or no hint of grammer -- sorely missing. Many entries even fail to indicate whether or not a particular language has a written and writing history. Yet the book is a lot of fun, thanks to its topic, and offers a nice perspective. Linguists, however, looking for solid information on languages should look elsewhere."
5,An enormously useful book!,"Here at work (a translation company), we use this book constantly for reference. It has been invaluable for quickly finding concise information and background on specific languages, and we find the written examples especially useful. A great book for very little money!"
5,Very good book for the amateur linguist.,"Absolutely fascinating. Most (all?) of the entries give a brief history of the language, and a description of the grammar and phonology. I loved it."
4,Good DVD,I've been there with my Mother when I was a kid. My 6 year is ready to go now that she has watched this DVD. It had interesting background information too.
1,Disappointed,"This book was a let-down from what was expected. It was a book only really explaining the basic theory. Most of which a competant sysadmin knows already - Large arrows pointing out what an RJ45 port looks like on a computer for example. This was contrasted by the fact that over 1/8th of the book is C sourcecode.The technology discussed, both hardware and software seems out of date: does anyone still use a liunx 2.0.30 kernel?Overall, the book was far too superficial and lacking in practical aspects of building a cluster and the availability of any software out there to help you."
5,A very good book.,"I am reading some books in order to set up a Linux Cluster.And I found this book, by far, the best. Maybe, because in this field I am a beginner."
5,My Daughter loves her UGG boots!,"My daughter wanted a pair of UGG Boots for her birthday, they were what I considered a little on the expensive side but they are well worth it!! They are so comfortable and look really cute on her!"
2,Warm I rate them 5 stars,"I bought these and they are so warm and comfy. If you are a half size, go down."
4,This is an excellent addition to a collection of ELO CD's,This would not be the first CD I would by to start my ELO collection. I rate 4 others CD's slightly better. But this one is very good. This was done during the Xanadu Movie score Jeff wrote. I wish Xanadu the song was part of this CD (it should have been). He got a little grief from his band mates about giving to much attention to the Movie.
4,Classic E.L.O All the Way,"Pretty good CD, has plenty of great stuff on it. However, 5 of these songs are on the Flashback collection, and two of the bonus tracks (On The Run and Second Time Around) are between 40 seconds and a minute long. The other bonus track, however, is very great, and catchy to boot.It all comes down to how big of an ELO fan you are: if you're after all their hidden gems, definitely worth it."
3,Not ELOs best.,It's a well-produced album but there's only a couple of classic songs in the mix. It's not a must buy.
3,"BEWARE OF TANGO-TIENDA ELO ""DISCOVERY""","I bought this CD, advertised as ""Remastered"" from Tango Tienda as NEW.They listed their home office with Amazon as shipping from NY, however when I received the CD, not only did it arrived from ARGENTINA, but also it was the ARGENTINE pressing on SONY, the booklet consisted of a bad copy of the front and back covers, while in the middle there were no lyrics or other photos, only a black and white text of the basic credits. The RECORDING was the ORIGINAL VERSION, with only 9 TRACKS, NOT THE REMASTERED re-issue or the extra tracks at the end. It took me almost 2 months, but I finally received a refund, only because I was furious to have received an offer of 40% credit if I returned the CD. After my email, I got 100% refund. If you are interested in this CD and the distributor is NOT AMERICAN, then, email them verifying that the CD for sale is indeed the remastered version, and not the crappy original version everybody is trying to dump on eBay."
5,One of the Best!!,"Out of all the ELO Records I have purchased since the 70's, this one is my 2nd Best!! This one is right in line with ""Out of the blue"", double album set.I have just bought this one along with the 30th anniversary CD, ""out of the blue"" which were Both Remastered.These two CD's bring back So many Good memories to me from the past, Good Time days, when Life seemed Better all around.I also purchased the ELO Music Video, Live at Wembley, which you also get a Bonus of the Discovery song Videos!! This Music video is Awesome as well!!Out of all the Music CD's I listen to these days with my Huge collection of various bands, ELO is my #1 choice,again, Especially ""Discovery"" and ""Out of the blue"", are my Favorites of all time!!!"
4,Alright... but not the best.,"I am a huge ELO fan. I have most of their albums. Yes it's true that Discovery has a bit of a disco sound... however it is not fully disco. Probably the only song on that album that I would consider being disco, would have to be ""Shine A Little Love"". In the CD booklet Jeff Lynne even says this is a bit of a disco tune. But, I believe that the rest of the album is not disco, it's totally ELO. This is probably my least favorite album, but it's stiull pretty good. If you like this album or any other ELO album, then you'll probably like the album that came after Discovery, entitled TIME. I believe that Time is ELO's best album. I know that a lot of people will disagree, but I think that album was a good concept."
4,Sympho disco with a quality mark on it.,"It`s probably hard to put this CD in to a certain category, but i would like to called it ""symphodisco"" . First of all this one has one of the greatest covers i know, which shows something of an arabian fantasy. Jeff Lynne is a great songwriter, that gives you something of an ""out of space experience"" when you listen to track after track. Track 5 Last Train to London, is my all time ELO hit``and shows you how a hit song should sound like. Track 6 the beautiful and sentimental MIdnight Blue is also included too. There are some tracks here that doesn`t make it to the top, but anyway the real Lynne rock and roller is included here Track 9 Don`t Bring me Down. A very good CD this one, but not ELO`s greatest."
3,"Not bad, but definitely a new direction","While Out Of The Blue hinted at the new direction for the band, Discovery grabbed the wheel and forcibly steered ELO toward a more dance oriented sound. ""Shine A Little Love"" and ""Don't Bring Me Down"" received major airplay, but also heavy rotation at discos all around the world. Long time fans were left feeling abandoned, and the band's fortunes began a slide that slowly ate away the foundation that had been built on Face The Music and A New World Record. After this, things would never be the same."
2,"Two of the three ""bonus tracks"" are less than 1 minute!","I already own this on vinyl and the original CD. I bought it to get the remastering and the bonus tracks. The remastering does seem to make it sound better, especially on the low end. However, these ""bonus tracks"" don't seem like much of a bonus. The first bonus track ""on the run"" seems like an early version of the real ""On The Run"" on track seven, and is 59 seconds long. ""Second Time Around"" is 41 seconds long! The third bonus track is a really fun tune, but it wasn't worth re-buying this CD for.I recommend this CD if you are an ELO fan and you don't already own this recording in a different version."
4,This is not Disco,"The other reviews of this album claim this is ELO dabbling in disco. I must be missing something and I've listened to this album hundreds of times since 1979. Disco is Donna Summer and K.C. and the Sunshine Band. The stellar Jeff Lynne should never be mentioned in the same breath as those lightweights.""Shine A Little Love"" and ""Last Train to London"" are not disco tunes, but great, upbeat songs. The intricate violin arrangements that are a hallmark of ELO precludes these tracks from putting them into the dreaded ""disco"" category. This record also contains two excellent ballads, ""Need Her Love and ""Midnight Blue.""Is this ELO's best? Far from it, but it was their last good album and last hurrah. For that reason alone, it's worth buying."
4,"Great album, not E.L.O's finest","E.L.O's discovery (1979) is a vintage album. It is one of their earliest albums, and as much as is it a fantastic one, it is not their best. If you want to hear their real masterpieces, take a look at ""Time"", ""Out of the blue"" or ""Eldorado"".Nevertheless, this one is pretty good, even a lot more than that. It features a lot of hits later on to be legends, and to hear it in a proper stereo can be just about it.Don't get me wrong, the only reason I rated it four stars and not five is because I think there are E.L.O's ablbums which deserve the meximum score for their genius quality. Besides that, this album is a fantastic one, and unquestionably one of their best ones.I would suggest you to try listen to this one, not for its hits, not for its quality (compare to 1970's recordings) but for its genius level of music, which you can always find in one of the finest E.L.O's albums.Very well recommended. Enjoy !"
3,ELO's Commercial Peak,"ELO hit their sales peak with the massive hit ""Don't Bring Me Down,"" from the album ""Discovery."" And while the song is one of their best, the album it is drawn from is inconsistant at best. Other songs that stand out include the catchy ""Last Train to London,"" ""Shine a Little Love,"" and ""Confusion,"" all worthy follow ups to ""Don't Bring Me Down."" The rest is a peculiar mixed bag of filler material including the really awful ""The Diary of Horace Wimp,"" which represents leader Jeff Lynne's songwriting at its most theatrically horrid. Note that the best songs here are also available on ELO's various anthology albums.Overall, an uneven album that contains some very good songs."
3,Disco sucks,"This is my least favorite ELO album, ironic because it is one of their best selling discs. In short, if I wanted a disco album I would buy a disco album."
4,One of ELO's best ever albums but not THE best!,"That honour has to go to ""Time"" in my opinion but still this album is very strong on its own merits. For one thing, this has been remastered by Jeff Lynne himself with 3 extra tracks and liner notes also written by Jeff plus the lyrics as well. I actually hate ""Don't...Down"" but ""Last Train..."" is one of my all-time favourite tracks ever. By the way, ""...Horace Wimp"" isn't as bad as all that and it has some interesting musical ideas and was always meant to be a kind of musical joke so don't take it so seriously. All the other tracks are good working examples of good songwriting and melody irrespective of genre and even disco, done tastefully is good music. Recommended."
5,"Suzie, thanks so much!","This cd reminds me of my sister, she turned me onto all the music greats. Sammy Hagar, Black Sabbath, and ELO. This cd is such a perfect mix of pop and subtle guitar work/keyboards, it's frightening. Every song is a winner, from the upbeat Last Train to the mood setting Midnight Blue. This is the first cd from ELO that I truly love. Sure Out of the Blue has a hit or two but the albums as a whole before this had too many holes. This and ""Time"" are my favorite ELO works, and I suppose they always will be. Buy this."
4,excellent pop record.,people should sit up and take notice of discovery. There are too many pop acts today churning out the same old tunes where as elo here have provided an album although nearly 20 years old with many good pop elements and strong tunes.
5,Excelentes obras de los hijos Bach,"Este cd contiene obras de uno de los más talentosos hijos de Johann Sebastian Bach: Carl Philip Emanuel.Estas cuatro sinfonias son de una belleza y una delicadeza extrema. Maravilloso el sonido de esta orquesta de cámara dirigida por el coreano Yoon K. Lee, simplemente hermoso. Obras representativas del Barroco Tardío o Rococo.Ademas, oímos una estupenda obra de otro hijo del gran bach: Wilhelm Friedemann, su Sinfonia en Fa major, obra de reminiscencias haendelianas. Muy parecida a las obras de Quantz, contemporaneo suyo de la corte de Sanssouci, Prusia.Un cd hermoso."
1,Not happy,Does not fit my JDP-15M. Not happy at all. Not sure what I'm going to do. Looks like I'll have to spend the money on a dedicated mortiser.
3,A Super Hit,This movie is one the biggest hits of Super Star Rajesh Khanna and is a movie which made him popular with kids who grew up seeing his future movies. This movie is about the relationship/bondage between man and animal. Elephants play an equally important role with Rajesh Khanna in the movie and the movie revolves around them. Tanuja playing the heroine also contributes. The movie has excellent music by Laxmikant Pyarelal who have composed some great hits for this movie sung by Kishore Kumar. One song of Mohammad Rafi is a class. The movie is a must see for movie watchers of all ages and especially the kids will enjoy this classic.
1,tw,Same kind performance as others but over priced! Try out Freud and the kind from Global Tools at half or less than half of the price. Can you tell the difference?
2,"If my saw sharpening guy is right, these are poor quality.","These have a sort of lamination where you only have good steel at the very point but the body is made of lesser steel.My saw sharpener ordered me solid steel blades at about half the cost which, to date, have been holding an edge better than these blades."
1,Does not last long,"I used less than 3 weeks and don't think I used it much.Blades are already dull and chip out the surface, so cannot make joining surface. If it costs less than $20, I may say ok. But it's way over priced."
3,JET JJ6-K Jointer Knives,I gave these knives a 3 because the cost is relatively high and the knives are sharpened on only one edge. For a few extra $ JET could provide a double edged blade and double the useful life as shown the photo when I bought them.
1,"Ferruccio Tagliavini, The Early Operatic Recordings 1940-1943","Thank You Amazon.com but I am not happy with the this CD, due to the fact that I used to own this very Album when it was an LP, that was my father's record. It sounds as scratchy as it did way back when I used to listen to the record. So, what is the big difference with this recording?It sounds as though the recording was just copied from the record to the CD, that is not remastering. FYI! be very careful about purchasing vintage recordings that claim to be remastered (ADD), from amazon.com. It just might be pirated material, claiming to be remastered. So buyer beware."
1,Not Kenny's Fault,"I have two of these cassettes. The first one has issues with the audio; the first time in handling over 500 cassettes that I've had this problem. So, I have a second copy bought online. Same problem. The music is probably very good, given the time frame and the artist. I'll have to pursue a different way of getting the songs."
4,Nice bag,"This is a nice bag for either a baby girl or boy with the two color flaps you can use interchangeably. I actually got this bag for my friend as she has a baby girl, and then I got the tan/green flaps for my baby boy. I haven't used mine as I am not due until February, but I really like that it has the insulated pocket for the feeding bottles. I think the material of this product is durable, not to mention the usefulness and convenience of the design.Although, I have to warn you that if it is available on Amazon, you should get it from Amazon and not from their outside vendors. I've had a bad experience with the seller of this product, so as soon as I saw the other color was available at Amazon, I bought it from Amazon and the transaction went smoothly.Overall, I would recommend this product. Nice bag!"
1,Not what I thought---,"This product is an okay item, but I don't like the fact that it doesn't have anything to close it on the outside, for example: velcro or a button of some sort. Oftentimes the bag is hanging open and it looks bulgy and has a disorganized appearance about it. I really don't like it at ALL!!! I wish I knew that it didn't have a locking devise on the outside, because to me, every baby bag needs that... Another point--- Not enough room on the inside--- We need more space!!! Thanks..."
3,An OK item,"I've had this bag for 9 months now, and think that it's an OK item. There are a few things that I like about it, and a few that I don't.What I like: it has a magnet, so you don't have to zip it. It's a great plus for me, because I oftentimes have to use it with just one hand available.It has a lot of room inside and many compartments. It came with a changing pad, although it's pretty big and takes up a lot of space. I also like that the bag has an insulated compartment for bottles. The strap is pretty wide, and the bag stays on your shoulder.what I don't like: the zippers break so easily! I mean, they still work, but the part that you hold on to, when zipping or opening the bag, comes off. I had one of them come off as soon as I received the bag, and took it out of the box. An insulated compartment for baby's bottles is too small. I could barely fit my 4 oz Avent bottles in there. And now, then I'm using bigger bottles, they don't fit in there at all."
1,diaper bad,I was happy with the diaper bag when I got it but have not had it long and the zipper part broke causing the flap to keep coming off now I have to get a new one dont invest in this diaper bag.
2,"More suitable for a marine biologist, chock full of oddballs",This book has pictures of every fish that swims in the ocean. Very few will you recognize and even fewer are suitable or available for a home aquarium. The pictures of the common aquarium fish were somewhat disappointing in quality and they are labelled by their scientific names. There is an index where you can cross reference the scientific name with the more common name but this quickly became tiresome for me. There is a quick review of the family characteristics of each species but no individual information. I would recommend this book only to an ichthyology student.
4,Most comprehensive fish review,"This is a must-have book for anyone seeking to setup & maintain a salt-water marine aquarium. There are full-color photos and information on over 1900 marine fish, invertebrates & plants.The book starts out with a basic description of the families of marine fish accompanied by b/w illustrations. Then the fish are arranged by family & displayed three per page in color. Both common & scientific names are given.Symbols below each fish give information on food, light, temperament, tank setup, swimming habits, size & family number. There are also great sections on aquarium setup, fish care, diseases & their prevention.Conveniently there are 3 indices. One is for aquarium setup. The others list marine life by either scientific or common name. Whether you are an experienced marine aquarist or have yet to set one up this is the book for you."
2,Complete Disappointment,"I read the other reviews before I bought the book, and I can't help but wonder if we're talking about the same book. Yes, it has really nice pictures, and yes, it covers a tremendous range of fishes, but the information is way too general to be at all useful. I will admit that my opinions result from being an aquarium owner, but I simply don't see any practical applications here for most of the general public unless you just want to see pretty pictures.For those who are considering buying this book, I seriously suggest that, if at all possible, give it a quick read and find out what you're truly getting."
5,Excellent book,I have a 300 gallon reef tank with many fish and corals. I got this book to increase my knowledge and ability to properly care for my fish. Its well written and did the job.
5,FINALLY! A BOOK THAT DELIVERS,"""THIS EASY-TO-USE GUIDE CONTAINS ALL THE INFORMATION YOU""LL NEED TO REPAIR YOUR CREDIT""; THAT STATEMENT IS ON THE FRONT COVER OF THIS BOOK AND BELIEVE ME IT'S A TRUE STATEMENT.THIS BOOK GIVES YOU ALL THE ESSENTIAL INFORMATION NEEDED TO REPAIR YOUR CREDIT;THIS BOOK HITS AN INSTANT HOMERUN BEGINNING WITH CHAPTER 1,WHICH IS A WELCOME CHAPTER.THIS CHAPTER MAKES YOU AWARE OF WHAT'S TO COME IN THE CHAPTERS AHEAD AND WHAT YOUR GOALS SHOULD BE.THIS CHAPTER IS A DEFINITE ICE BREAKER.I'VE BEEN IN THE CREDIT REPAIR BUSINESS FOR A WHILE AND I FEEL ANYONE WHO READS THIS BOOK WILL BECOME HIGHLY EDUCATED WITH THE CREDIT REPAIR PROCESS AND WILL ACCOMPLISH THIER GOALS.THIS BOOK IS SO EASY TO USE,IT MAKES YOU FEEL CONFIDENT ABOUT REPAIRING YOUR CREDIT.ANYONE USING THIS BOOK WILL FELL LIKE AN EXPERT AT THE END!MY FINAL STATEMENT,""YOU CAN'T GO WRONG WITH THIS BOOK""."
1,JUNK,This is a waste of time. Spending 15 minutes surfing the net will yield you better and more accurate info than this piece of garbage.
3,The Chinese edition is better,Dr. Kelly is best known of course for his research on the intricacies of interest rate regulation that will be necessary once time travel becomes affordable to anyone. But this book he wrote (after his wife Etacar ruined his credit when he divorced her after finding out she had had a sex change operation to become a woman) is not too bad either. The Chinese edition is so much better though because it has additional chapters on international credit repair (for example by becoming a citizen of another country like Estonia and then immigrating back to your own country).
2,Sucked.,"I'm giving this two stars, because it's better then nothing, but it's just a giant listing of form letters and a boring algorithm to follow. I suppose it might actually work, but it doesn't give you an insight or knowledge you can use to work the system like the Gorilla Guide does. I ordered the two books at once figuring I'd read both, and this one flat out sucked."
1,Don't waste your time,"This book told me nothing. Its filled with common information and he drags it out paragraph after paragraph. You can clearly see this is quickly put together with no REAL research for a profit. If you know you have to dispute any credit errors with the credit companies, than you already have more information than whats in this book. If you are a complete ... and don;t know anything about credit, you MIGHT get something out of this. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME. MOST OF IT IS USELESS SAMPLE FORMS.JasonD"
3,pretty good - I rate it a solid 3.5,"Pros - easy to read and concise; good tips on how to establish and re-establish credit; good job explaining the credit reporting process and the importance of credit and the three types of lenders (prime, subprime, and secondary).Cons - does not include info about credit scoring; steps for fixing credit are too cumbersome for the average consumer to follow; tips for how to strengthen credit are ineffective, outdated, misleading - such as having account added to your credit record - the agencies don't do that anymore. incorrect data about the length of time chapter 13 bankruptcies stay on credit reports; sample letters are too vague.The book could have been more detailed to help readers fully grasp credit. It's a good introdution to credit that wiill leave you seeking more information. recommendation - The Insider's Guide to credit Repair by K.E. Varner and Your Credit Score by Liz Weston."
5,This Book is Changing My Life!,"I've always been afraid to face my credit problems but this book has helped me take positive steps to turn my life around.I had an car reposesed four years ago but thanks to this book, I'm fixing my credit and will be buying a house in the fall.This book was very easy to understand! I recomend it to anyone who needs to clean up their credit. No matter how bad you may think it is, there is a solution...just buy this book!!"
2,I found more info online for free.,I thought that it would be a little more in-depth. It's very basic and I was not that happy with it. I even found better form letters online for free!
3,"CD contents lacking, text not that great","The only reason I used to chose MS Press over Sybex in the past was the limited version of Win2k they included. Now that they don't include it, I won't be going with them, as I've never been thrilled about the actual books."
1,This book is a POS!!,This Book is the biggest POS I have ever had for a MCSE book. The cd is such a joke the testing software sucks so bad it does not even test you chapter by chapter. I went and took the 70-270 test and I was not ready for it at all. I went out and bought the sybex 70-270 book and its safe to say I will be so ready for the test now. The software on the sybex book lets you test yourself chapter by chapter and overall the book it set up much better.
3,MS Press not thinking - Needs trial software,"MS Press seems to have a very hard time conceptualizing what they are selling - a packaged training experience. Their ""MCSE 2000 Core Four"" package has the trial version of the Windows 2000 Server CD, but no Professional CD for the Professional section. The XP Training Kit doesn't include a trial of the XP software - though these things can be obtained for free from Microsoft for the asking and waiting a few weeks. Get it together and put everything necessary in the box!"
3,NO Trail software,"Without the trial software we are all inconvenienced by having to buy the product to test it, or to ask Microsoft for the product and wait close to eternity for it.Why not include a trial version of the product in the kit, and leave out the digital version of the book? That would be truly helpful!"
2,A far cry from a study aid,"It's a given that no one study guide will give you the understanding to pass the associated MCSE exam, but this barely qualifies as a study guide. For someone who has never worked with Windows before and has never seen XP before, this might be a good ""Windows XP for Dummies""-like book. It does quickly gloss over most of the basics of the OS, how to network it and even how to deploy it, but falls short of even being a How-To for people looking to support and not wanting to study for the exam. A good example of just how much information this book lacks is to take the practice exam off the included CD-ROM. Less than five questions into the practice exam, the information needed to get the question right is not even covered in the book.My suggestion would be to anyone who is looking to prep for the exam is to read the XP Resource Kit, the on-line help, and Microsoft's Readiness Review for XP - and leave this book on the shelf."
1,The Exam does not work,"Per Microsoft Press, due to a recent update for a security fix.KB840315The exam that comes with this book on the CD does not work.How did I find out? I bought the book. I tried the exam. I wrote to Microsoft Press and they told me this."
3,Could Be Better,"The only reason I gave this book 3 stars is because, as nearly as I can tell, everything that I ran into on the test was mentioned in this book. I think IE configuration, troubleshooting portable computer configuration, and Windows XP Stop errors were extremely lacking. As is becoming more and more typical, this book had to many pages, and not enough of the right information.As a side note, I did pass the exam on the first try, but I credit that more to real world experience than to this book."
1,"The most stupid ""study guide"" that I've ever seen.","This book is far away for being a complete study guide for 70-270 exam preparation. Many questions, that you'll see on the actual exam, do not covered in this book at all. If you are familiar with Win XP, you'll find this book totally useless. If you're newbie to WinXP, you'll see the lack of explanations in many important topics. I'm totally disappointed with Microsoft Press. If you want to pass the exam, choose Sybex."
1,Very insufficient......................,This book is highly insufficient for passing MCSE.There are no practice tests....book written just to give u a brief overview. Hardly deals with the scenario based questions that the original exam has....Don't waste your bucks on this one...
2,Rushed,"It is obvious that Microsoft rushed to get this book out. While is may be helpful in learning XP, it does no good when studying for the XP exam."
2,Clippers not so great,I was dissappointed with these clippers...some other review said it was great w persians... I did not have good luck w the clippers going through my elderly persian's long white hair I got very choppy results and it did not seem like the clippers were cutting too well
1,NOT good,"DO NOT buy if you will use on a long-haired or soft-haired cat. This trimmer sucks by all accounts. It would only cut the fur on the back of my 2 cats since (almost as if it was butter, but only the first time i used it, after that it started to have trouble) the skin around the spine is more stretched than the skin on the chest and sides; just like in humans the skin on our backs is more tightly pulled than the looser skin on our chest and belly area. It would take like 2 hrs. to finish trimming each cat. Do not waste money on this junk, just invest in a more expensive model, TRUST ME it will save u from a lot of stress.You'll get what your money is worth w/ this cheap trimmer"
5,Has performed as advertised,"We bought this clipper several years ago to experiment with grooming our dogs at home. Being an experiment, we didn't want to spend a lot of money. We have 2 miniature poodle type mixed breeds who grow LOTS of excess hair. After all this time (at least 4 years) it still cuts just fine. Still has the original blades. I clean and oil it, though not as often as I should. It does get pretty hot after running for awhile, but it was sold as a ""touch-up"" trimmer. We don't usually do a whole cut in one sitting. Considering what we paid for this clipper, we feel it has out performed our expectations."
1,Was not useful..,I used this product on a maltese/yorkie (5-8lbs)and it was not useful at all. I was better off using a scissor. Her hair is low and it did not pick up hair when clipping.
4,You really should hear the Songs to Poems of William Blake,"I bought this disk to hear the settings of the Songs to Poems of William Blake. They really are quite stunning. My favorite is ""The Little Black Boy"", but they are all quite good.The rest of the songs are also better than I had expected and I am glad that I have this disk. I recommend it to you. I believe you would be glad to have it in your collection."
5,Exposing Self Deception,"The title of this book should probably be Self Deception and Leadership since the book focuses more on self deception than it does leadership. This in no way, however, diminishes the value of this book. Whether it is due to the story based format, the ease with which it reads, or its valuable content I am not sure, but this is one of those rare books that once you start reading, you can't put it down. What a gem to add to my library on self deception.As someone who works in the area of personal development, I certainly see how the pervasiveness of self deception impacts our lives daily. This book is a great introduction to the issue of self deception. I personally believe everyone, not just leaders, can and will benefit from reading this book. I highly recommend it.According to the information in the back of the book about the Arbinger Institute, this book introduces Phase 1 of Arbinger's 3 Phase System. I can't wait to learn about phases 2 and 3."
2,About as Common as Sense Can Get,"I (unfortunatly) was forced to read this by the company I work for and will be attending a siminar put on by arbinger themselves. The book does have good info, the problem I have with it is they make it sound like this is some new and exciting scientific breakthrough. It is amazing how much money these groups and consultants can rip off of people by pointing out the obvious. This is not meant to be an insult to those that enjoyed the read, but I would say to others who have not read this ""if you know how to treat others with respect then you don't need this book"" I'm just glad it was given to me by the company I work for and I didn't have to waste money on it"
2,Nothing new here,"Like so much pop-psychology today, what this book teaches is a small portion of Biblical Chrisianity...but without the Bible and without Christ.The book could also be titled The Golden Rule. It teaches, basically, ""do (treat) unto others as you would have them do (treat) you."" In the business world, this philosophy has been a formal rule for how to do business since 1902 when J. C. Penney opened his first store, named the Golden Rule Store, which he developed into the JC Penney chain of today. As a moral philosophy, the ideas of this book have been around since Christ taught them 2000 years ago. This philosophy in an awesome one to live your life and business by. However, unlike what the authors seem to suggest, it is not the key.Why settle for a portion of Biblical Christianity when you can have it all, free of charge."
3,Leadership and Self Deception,The book is excellent. I had already read the book. I bought several. But...one of my books is defective and even has a sticker saying that it is defective. I am very unhappy with this purchase because of the fact that I was unable to give one book as a gift as I intended.
4,"Nice read, but not a leadership book","The author did a great job on using a narrative story telling way to introduce the concept of the ""Box"", which covers pretty much on all on the ""Self Deception"" part. When I was reading this book, I kept hoping to read more on other topic, especially on ""Leadership"". Like other reviewer said, this is not a leadership book.I gave it 4 stars because I still benefit from the content of this book."
5,A life Changing Book,This book was referred to me by a friend and is a life changing book. I have shared it around the office as well. Well written and an easy read.
3,Good stuff... I think,"Using a fictional-parable format, and co-written by a psychologist (Brigham Young University's Terry Warner), this book takes a psychological approach to leadership. It's not what you do that matters, say the authors, but why you do it. Pursuing the latest leadership fad won't make people follow you if your motives are selfish-- people can perceive deception even when it is supposedly trying to empower them. Learning to remain vigilant for the signs of self-deception is at the heart of the book.Innovative, intriguing... but ultimately difficult to read, difficult to understand, and elusive in its applicability. It is certainly not a handbook for the masses or even the average Jane trying to become an authentic, compassionate leader. It's research, not pedagogy.Coke Newell, consultant, author of ""Journey to Edaphica"""
5,Outstanding Book,"This is a great book with amazing insights into human nature. The concepts are applicable to anyone, not just leadership. I'm leading some of my non-management employees through a discussion of the book. They seem to really identify with the book."
5,Awesome Book!,This book was such an easy read and very motivating. It will cause anybody to self-reflect and want to make changes in their lives. Anyone who reads this book will not be disappointed.
5,Built a company on these ideas,"My business partners and I built a healthcare company on the ideas from this book. We are amazed at what it has helped us achieve. The book helps us help people at all levels of our organization conceive business results in a way that helps their co-workers achieve their results. Vigorous collaboration is commonplace among those leaders and teams in our company where principles taught in the book are applied. The proof for us has been in how this kind of collaboration has produced blue-chip results in our individual business units and relative to the industry at large. Careful reading and re-reading of this book has proven better than any productivity, team building, or leadership training we've encountered."
4,"Good for work, good for life","A great book that teaches a simple yet very important philosophy of how we interact with the people that are closest to us on a daily basis. Your co-workers, employees and family will all benefit from you reading this book. They should read it too, this book is a recipe for a new way of thinking in American culture. Switching to a ""how can I help"" culture from the ""what's in it for me"" culture will bring about revolutionary change in your basic operating environment. I have already seen personal results by implementing this switch in my interactions with those around me.The concept is laid out in an easy to read story format that gets you to identify with the characters as well as with your actions and reactions to similar topics in your own life. I recommend it for anybody that has ever wished to improve their relationships, at work, home, with friends and acquaintances."
5,An Influential Work,This is a book that provides information on the foundational elements of behaviour and thus is applicable to all elements of society. I read it in one sitting on a Saturday night because it grabbed my interest. It's unique content is easily understood and deeply motivational. I believe it will be beneficial in all aspects of life to everyone who reads it. This material can change lives in a positive way!
5,Eye opening! Really worth the money,"This is not a typical blah-blah book on skill or management technique. This book really go deep deep into the ""heart issue"" which is so fundamental before all the skills."
2,I suppose it could be useful ...,"... but like most ""leadership"" books, it presents material that is more common sense than anything. However it may be the most obvious things that people overlook.Nonetheless, the book can inadvertently create even more of ""a box"" between those who believe in the book's mantra and those who don't. The former will accuse the latter of ""being in the box"" while the latter may argue how the content oversimplifies things. In reality, like most philosophies, the answer is probably in the middle somewhere. The book recommends that we should evaluate our relationships as those between people, rather than objects, and that any problems we see may really be problems with ourselves. This ignores the fact that there are in reality (albeit hopefully uncommon) low performers, disrespectful, and dishonest people, and sometimes the problem really is with them."
1,"Nice theory, stupid story","I was encouraged to read this by a company I work for. Although I find the theory to be a very good one and one that I will work to be aware of, the delivery was pitiful! It is deliberately put in story form, which I find very juvenile. The main character in the story can't understand the explanation and keeps saying so. That does not inspire confidence that anyone else will get it! I believe that the whole idea could have been summed up in two paragraphs, but then you couldn't sell a ""book""."
5,"Profound, practical, life-changing","By nature, I'm skeptical. I don't normally gush--about anything. But I'm about to. For both my work life and my home life, this is the most important book I have ever read. I don't think I will ever be the same person again. And I think a lot of people will be quite happy about that. I've purchased dozens of copies for friends and they've all been moved by the book the same way I have. Read and ponder it and you'll do yourself (and others in your life) a big favor."
5,Couldn't Put it Down,"I defy anyone to put this book down - business leader, parent, or spouse. Fabulous!"
5,couldn't put it down,"This is one of those books that I couldn't put down. It is an easy read, but I find myself thinking about the subject matter in almost all settings. I don't think the content of this book only applies to leadership. It applies to pretty much all of us. I reccomend it highly. I'm tempted to buy a copy for all of my friends and coworkers."
5,Gives New Meaning to Thinking Outside the Box,"This book gives a whole new meaning to thinking outside of the box. For anyone that seems to always be in a defensive mode or position, this a terrific book to help get you out of your own box, improve your working relationships and help increase productivity."
5,Out of the Box!,"This book has changed my thinking about people; and in changing my thinking about them, I have changed my behavior towards them. And that is the key to this material, changing our behavior towards others. My relationships are much richer and most of the inventory that I took of others, has melted away. I absolutely recommend this book to all human beings and anyone wishing to become a better one."
1,Waste of time,You mean if I'm nice to people and not selfish than the world will be a better place??? This book is ground breaking.......if it's your first day of pre-school.
1,Light on Content,"I rarely take the time to write reviews. I'm taking the time to write one for Leadership and Self-Deception because it was such a poor book. The content in this book could have been contained in a pamphlet.The author takes a story line approach that's excessively long and becomes tiresome. The illustrations should be shortened significantly. There are only a handful of concepts covered; the rest is fluff and a waste of space (and my time). I would have much preferred a book detailing concepts backed by concise illustrations and supporting examples. Rather then using bloated anecdotes, I would have appreciated a more engaging and intellectually stimulating approach. I can't imagine Stephen Covey, who endorsed the book, reading every page cover to cover. There's just not enough content to warrant it.If you have access to this book free of cost, it's worth a skim. Otherwise, I recommend looking elsewhere."
3,Not incredibly helpful,"I had high expectations for this book, but it did not deliver. It was interesting, and was an easy read, but not particularly practical."
2,"Okay to a point, but...","The good: The message that each individual should take more responsibilty in his relationships. Instead of dismissing those who don't see the world (or the job) from your own perspective, make a better effort to see it (& yourself) from theirs.The bad: (2 issues)1) If you are looking for a business book, this really isn't it. It's about relationships. If you are looking for steps to be a better business leader you may find this book unsatisfying.2) In the end, the book is just an appetizer for the services of the Arbinger Institute, & leaves you feeling like something was left out. I felt like I paid for a commercial."
4,"Logical, insightful and filled with real gem","I found the leadership style described in this book to be in line with the Gandhian way of leadership. In other words, leading with assertion instead of aggression and always with an inward mindfulness of self thoughts, words and actions - caring, non-violent and non-manipulative.The book is also very enjoyable to read with many good practical tips to be used in everyday personal and professional life. Life outside of the box is certainly more pleasant and welcoming towards real opportunities."
2,"I get to the end and ... figure out it's written by a consulting firm, not a single author",I like the premise for this book and I liked the structure of the story. The authors raise some valid points and provide good ideas. I was very disappointed with the ending . You discover that the hero has only completed phase 1 and the other two phases aren't going to be covered. I was left feeling that this book was really a piece of marketing liturature from the Arbinger Institute to sell more of their services
5,Is it really everyone else's fault. No! A must read for leaders,"I wish that I could prescribe this book to numerous leaders that I know and have known. I can not tell you how many times I have been asked to ""fix"" the front line team. Obviously they are broken. Leadership is doing everything right. Here in lies the self-deception. The pattern of blaming everyone else for the problems and refusing to be accountable must be broken to create a healthy community. If you have not read this book, do so and insist on having every leader in your community do so as well. Bring your managers together and work together to implement. What agreements must be made to create a safe environment to remove self deception? How do you remove the fear that paralizes healthy practices? Address these issues then be accountable to create the personal change necessary to implement these concepts."
5,Excellence in action,"This is an excellent and ""user friendly"" contribution to peoples' ability to see ourselves clearly, with easy-to-grasp concepts for viewing self and tools for changing. A most valuable book, whether in book form or audio. I highly recommend it for anyone, leader or not. Coaches will find it especially valuable."
5,Great book for business communications and personal development,This book is a wonderful tool for anyone who wishes to learn how to improve human relationships and interpersonal communications - at work or at home. It is an easy read using a storytelling approach to convey deep ideas quickly and memorably. I have recommended it to my entire management team and to many friends.
4,Great stuff,"This collection is essential for anyone getting into rockabilly or fifties R&R.; There's a lot of real great tracks here. Some favorites of mine include 'Tired and Sleepy' and 'Nervous Breakdown.'There's a couple of songs here though, that I'd be embarrassed to listen to. Case in point 'Sitting in the Balcony.' 'Drive-in Show' is another, but I listen to this song because at one point it sounds like Cochran sings ""I take to my penis like a candy bar."" Ha... I'm immature."
4,fine sounding hits,"These are all quite good hits, but the price is a little high, but then again it is hard to get all these songs.I had to order this album as a cheaper one with less songs on it was not available,but overall, this is a satisfying cd."
5,Not The End Of The Summertime Blues Story,"I sat reading Sharon Sheeley's ""SUMMERTIME BLUES"" ISBN 978-1-893660-18-2 while the CD played in the background. It was as if Eddie and Sharon were there with me, sharing the intimate details of their lives together. A great rock and roll experience. Fantastic music, and a MUST read for all rock and roll enthusiasts."
3,Decent,"I'M A BIG ROCKABILLY FAN SO BASED ON REVIEWS I DECIDED TO GIVE THIS CD A TRY. COMPARED TO THE PERKINS, ELVIS, BERRY, AND HOLLY STUFF, THIS DOESN'T QUITE MEASURE UP. DON'T GET ME WRONG IT IS A GOOD CD, JUST NOT AS HIGH CALIBER AS THE STUFF I GENERALLY PLAY AND LISTEN TO. IF SUMMERTIME BLUES HAD BEEN AN ELVIS SONG WITH SCOTTY MOORE, IT WOULD HAVE REALLY BEEN A CLASSIC LIKE HEARTBREAK HOTEL. BUT, FOR THE MOST PART, IT IS GOOD LISTENING, BUT IT IS EASY TO UNDERSTAND THAT SHORT CAREER OR NOT, EDDIE AIN'T IN THE SAME CLASS AS THE AFOREMENTION ROCKERS."
2,Already Tired!,This book is way too demanding for someone already too tired to find the energy to read it completely. I have fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue. The reviews on this book should state the demands it would make on an individual to follow its perscriptions.
1,Something interesting about the other reviews,"I read the glowing reviews listed for Dr. Katz's book, but noticed that all the reviewers seem to come from just two places--Salisbury, MD and the New Haven,CT area. Katz, of course, teaches at Yale which is located in New Haven. Maybe he is from Salisbury or has a lot of friends there. In any case, it is very suspicious that in a huge country such as the USA the reviews for a book come from only two locations. Statistically it is possible--but then it is also possible for a monkey to write Hamlet."
4,The Way to Eat,This is an excellent book on what everyone needs to know about eating. I highly recommend it to anyone who is concerned about weight and diet.
3,"Jet 8"" dado insert",It is a well made cast aluminum or zinc product but did not fit my Jet Table Saw without quite a bit of filing. I think the casting was several thousandths oversize and when the insert was powder coated the coating made the insert way to large to fit.
4,Dado insert,"I have used my insert twice now and found it works great. Once you have leveled it with the four adjusting screws, I put a drop of Locktight on them to keep them from being adjusted by the saw's vibration."
2,X51V charger,"This charger does charge the PDA but creates ""Hash"" on the audio output from the PDA making it impossible to use the audio playback while connected."
1,Colors Don't Match Actual Paint,"I was very excited to get this book, but was very disappointed after reading/looking at it. I found a pallete I liked, so off to the paint store I went with book in hand. Turns out most of the colors in the book did not come close to matching the actual paint chip. I found the colors in the book to be browner than the paint chips at the store. Then the color codes for the paint did not match the codes in the store. I could not match most of the Ralph Lauren or Glidden paint color codes to what was on the paint chips. I had to ask the store to look up a color and give me the code so I could find the paint chip.Maybe it was a printing error that caused almost every color in the book to be browner than the paint chip at the store, but I expected the colors to at least be close. They were note even close.Bottom line, this book was not worth the money."
3,Falls short of its potential,"While the concept for this book is great, its execution falls short of fulfilling its potential. The book is divided according to the colors of the color wheel and lists palette combinations of three colors relative to such hues. My biggest disappointment stems from the fact that each combination is illustrated in the form of a ""flat"" CAD-like sketch which lacks real-life depth and is limited in conveying the ""feel"" of the combination. The ilustrations are sterile and insipid looking. I believe that this book would have been ideal if, instead, a photograph of an interior, utilizing the color palette, would have been used."
1,huh?,"The only inspiration I got from this book was to write a review to warn others not to buy it.Many of the color combinations seem completely off--and I'm very color oriented and progressive!Although it offers specific manufacturer paint references, I did NOT find the colors to be true when I compared them to the actual paint chips at the paint stores. So, that was completely useless, not to mention frustrating.This book, with its flat ideas was such a waste of my money I wouldn't even 'resell' it through Amazon because I would feel guilty."
1,worthless,"This book is nothing but some color swatches. There are no photos to show how the combinations can be used and the combinations are not even interesting - - just the same basic stuff over and over again, I would not buy this book again and it's one of the few books that I have ever thrown away."
2,"An ok publication, but not a good value","The Mar & Apr 2010 issues have been a real disappointment both in length (only 16 pages) and content. I expected more quality content with useful practical information based on editor Rick Durden's columns on [...]. Basically, I wouldn't recommend this publication to anyone with much instrument experience. I was hoping that it would be a useful source of ""enrichment"" material to use in my instrument ground schools, but alas, there has been little really useful for that either. Use the $59 to buy a copy of the FAA Instrument Procedures Handbook (FAA-H-8261-1 and ISBN 9781560275510) and a copy of Peter Dogan's Instrument Flight Training Manual (ISBN 0916413268)"
4,"I didn't know I liked ""Bubblegum"" until I heard this collection",Totally upbeat tunes get you singing along in no time. Great music to clean the house to.
3,Bubble full on hot air Yummy Yummy,"I Love Bubble gum oldies - The songs below are the best and are played a lot on many oldies stations up and down the east coast - the rest are ok but not as good as these hit tracks below1. Yummy, Yummy, YummyOhio Express2. TracyThe Cuff Links (same singer as Archies)3. I'm A BelieverThe Monkeys4. Gimme Gimme Good Lovin'Crazy Elephant6. Jam up & Jelly TightTommy Roe7.

Love Grows (Where My Rosemary Goes)Edison Lighthouse22. My Baby Loves Lovin'The White Plains25. Sugar SugarThe ArchiesThe other tracks brought down the value to me but like I said I thought I was listening to a oldies station for a while"
5,Sweet Deal! A++,I a 58 year old teen ager! This CD is like Candy for me! I can enjoy it daily without gaining weight!
3,Not as good as expected,"About 25% of the cuts on this CD are very obscure, not even hitting the top 50 on the charts, a couple above the top 100. The groups listed on the front of the case and the labels on the back show the best of the CD. They don't show the unknowns or little knowns. I question whether some should even be listed as bubble gum music, but that doesn't diminish their quality. There are 25 songs, but I liked only 18 at best. Look closely at the list of songs before buying."
4,bubbles forever!,"While I don't really think this IS the ultimate bubblegum collection,I do hear a lotta great bubblegum on here!Hey,a Banana Splits tune!A Josie and the Pussycats song!Cool deal!I can think of a few songs that should have been on here,but whatever.This rocks!"
3,"A guilty, secret pleasure","C'mon now. Deep inside we are have a soft spot for the sugar coated bubblegum music that helped define the baby-boomer generation. These songs convey the happy, feel good, and ""I'll do whatever I want to do"" mentality that captured the post-revolutionary attitude of it's time. Not all inclusive, but with some of the more refined bubblegum offerings. Interesting how these tunes were accompanied by social upheaval: the looming end to the Vietnam nightmare, watergate, roe v. wade, voting and drinking age lowered to 18,... and stood as the aftergram of protest music (Buffalo Springfield, Mason Proffit, CS&N, etc...) Get the CD, hide it under your panties in the top drawer, lefthand side, and sneak a listen when no one is looking."
3,Another Album you will want for your collection.,"Compiling a great collection requires having all of the songs that made the past in music history. This album has songs that you just don't find on the normal ""Best Of"" or ""Greatest Hits By""."
5,25 All Time Greatest Bubblegum Hits,These songs take me back to high school. I love it and if you were a teen in the late 60's early 70's you will love it to.
3,Not the greats compilation but has some classics,"Not exactly the best compilation of all time, but the album has a few great songs that we wanted to have. Also provides a variety as opposed to buying multiple discs."
1,"Incomplete, poor quality, flimsy","I wish I had read the reviews on Amazon before purchasing this item. One of the holes for the brake lock screws was not completely tapped. The hardware for the extension wing was not included. The unit flexes when moved.I tapped the hole myself, bought some nuts and bolts, and made it work. However, I wish I had purchased the Shop Fox portable base instead. I saw one under the same table saw a few days ago at a Woodcraft store and it appeared to be of much higher quality."
2,Not the best way to move a saw.,"I recently purchased this base to move my new Jet cabinet saw in and out of my small work shop and onto the deck in front. There is a small drop (1/2"") from one floor to the other. This method of base construction will not allow the saw to make this type of transition. For me that was a big negative. The base is of no use. Also, the base arrived with one of the two taped holes for the wheel locks left blank. Any minimal quality check would have spotted this. When I called HTC they said to tap the hole myself. For what I paid for this base I could have made my own much better. The only good thing I can say is it's sturdy and the finish is good. I guess I'll try to sell it. Look carefully before buyung this base."
3,Needs to be stiffer,I purchased the mobile base with Jet table saw. It went together rather easily. You have to only attach the wheels and the angled bracket that holds the extension table legs. But what did bother me was that the saw tilted inward when it was on the base alone. This leaning made it difficult to line up the extension table with the cast iron top. I solved this by placing a heavy tool box on the opposing side to get the saw to tip the other way. The saw is straight after the extension table was bolted in. I just hope it stays that way over time.
5,Needed in a small shop,HTC makes great products and this mobile base is no exception. I had to block up the saw and fit the base around the saw but otherwise it is very easy to move the saw around the shop.
3,Hitachi sliding compound saws,"I love the Hitachi 10"" and 8 1/2"" sliding compound saws for their lightness, compactness, and portability. The power and accuracy is all one could ask for. The range of motion, mitering 57 degrees to the right, is awesome. Sounds good so far, right? Well, no . . . I will never buy another unless they change one thing:That miter scale, with those idiotic 10th pitch marks (It's the USA, folks, and we do some things different!), crown miter marks and preset angle marks crowded on an already hard-to-read scale with poorly cast markings, is impossible to read. Many other finish carpenters agree.I complained to a Hitachi rep. at a big tool exhibit about this and he actually told me that Hitachi wasn't going to change their tool ""just for me."" OK, fine! I'll take my business elsewhere.It's too bad. It's a pretty good tool with one huge flaw that, in my opinion, makes it too-much-hassle to use."
4,Don't drop from 24 feet,"I waited a long time to buy this saw hoping the price would come down - especially when DeWalt introduced their 12"" model. I could wait no longer and bought the saw for about $700.00. I've spent 2-1/2 years building my house with this saw - a fairly complex three story Victorian and enjoyed using it. Now the [lower] price ... seems like a bargin to me. The accuracy and the action of the saw are very good but the guages are difficult to read.Also, a word of caution: You really need a wide work space on which to secure this saw because the weight of the head in the up postion, pushed on the way back can make the saw flip over backwards if used on too narrow a surface when not screwed down. That's how I lost mine off the 12"" railing of my third floor balcony. An estimated $400. repair bill has essentially totaled it. It is not as easily portable as you might expect. I feel like someone ran over my dog."
5,Hitachi C10FS Dual Slide,"The miter saw that will greatly improve your pruduction and quality of work. Start up is very smooth,Bevels right and left(keeps you from having to turn your stock around) Most don't like the hard to read angels on base and neck, but is ok with me. This saw combinded with a nice Miter Stand (I have mine mounted on the Rouseau Stand with ext. wing and stop system), is the perfect set up for any jobsight.. For the guys that want a saw that seems to cut the mustard in a miter, compound miter,square cut how ever you like your mustard? This is the saw to do the job right!"
5,A Big Surprise for the Small Price,"This card stock was much nicer than I imagined it would be for the price. I was trying to come up with a creative idea for wedding programs for a bride on a shoestring budget and an odd choice of wedding colors (black teal, turquoise and ivory) when I happened upon the Bison Storefront.Not only did I receive the paper next day, due to their relative proximity, but the paper was as close to accurate as one might imagine for an uncalibrated monitor. I am thrilled but most importantly, so is my customer. I will definitely shop with them again."
5,Totally Enjoyable,"The movie is layed out differently than the book, but it worked for me. I totally enjoyed it!"
3,SEPTEMBER by Rosamund Pilcher,"I really enjoyed this adaptation of Rosamund Pilcher's novel, September.It was very true to the book, which is unusual these days.The cast consists of some of Britain's tried and true actors, a factor that made it all the more enjoyable."
2,September,"I have never been as disappointed in a movie as I have with September. The scenery is lovely as are the homes, you like to know where to place your characters when you are reading a book. I have read September twice and I loved it. When the movie ended, I thought it was a joke! Even though I knew there was only one DVD in the package, I had to look to be sure I wasn't imagining things. The movie just ended! No story lines were wrapped up. What was Pandora talking to Carlos about on the phone? Why did they find Virginia's shawl in the loch and not Pandora's fur coat on the shore? If I hadn't read the book, I would have thought they found Virginia's body in the loch! What about the big party? What about Lottie? What about Henry going to school? What were they thinking?"
1,Disappointing Soap Opera,"If you enjoyed the book, I wouldn't recommend the DVD. Some fine actors, but the characters have none of the charm or depth that they have in the book. In fact, the portrayals are not at all true to the book. It appeared to be a cheesy made for TV miniseries: Part soap opera, part horror story."
1,September,"If you have never read the book, the movie might be o.k. That said, I did read the book and as far as I can tell, the movie ended at the half way point. I was very disappointed and would not recommend this movie."
2,The Movie September,"The movie ""September"" did not hold a candle to the wonderful book of the same title by Rosamunde Pilcher. The book was filled with much more material about the characters particulary about the wayward sister and the death scene was not as accurate as it could have been. The book is well worth reading, the movie is a possible give away to the S.A. The movie about the my favorite Pilcher book, ""The Shell Seekers"" with Angela Lansbury was done in a more satisfactory fashion, although this too, because of time (how long can a movie be?)could have gone on and on.I highly encourage anyone who has not read one of Pilcher's books, to give it a go and forget about ""September"", the DVD. Bonnie A."
4,SEPTEMBER SONG,"Enjoyed the dvd immensely. Stayed pretty close to the original story line I thought. The actors in the various roles played their parts very well. Like all Rosamund Pilcher stories, never want them to end."
4,Does not contain ALL the songs on original release,"The original release contained 12 songs. This only has 11. Missing is ""Sing Of A Merry Christmas"". I found that dissapointing. The packaging and conditioning are excellent but I don't understand why that song was left out. I will say, however, that the CD is everything the seller said it was and it brings back so many fond memories of my childhood Christmas past."
5,Great Christmas Album,"I, too, beg you to restock this release. I was lucky to find the CD several years ago, having had a scratchy LP. My daughter has been looking for it for quite a while. Please don't make me give her mine! It is the memories of many Christmas's - the songs are unique and not to be found else where!"
3,Not what was on the original album...,"I've read several reviews about songs which were on the original LP (The Little Drummer Boy - A Christmas Festival - The Harry Simeone Chorale), but they are not on this CD. The only way to get the original music would be to burn the vinyl to disc. I hope that the actual wonderful recording will someday be released on CD!"
2,I wasn't happy I wish I could get a refund,I really only bought this because I couldn't fined any other in the time frame I had to use this perluss
5,Harry Simeone Chorale,"This is an excellent CD. However, I wish that the original recording that I used to listen to as a kid 40 years ago was on CD. I have a 2 album set that includes Sing We Now Of Christmas with the Harry Simeone Chorale with brass choir and orchestra. This included the original version of The Little Drummer Boy. The second album is called, ""Merry Christmas Carols with Organ and Chimes."" It featured the original grand Wurlitzer Pipe Organ of the Radio City Music Hall. The album cover shows a fuzzy painting of three girls wearing coats and hats singing from some sheet music that the girl in the middle is holding. I enjoy this Christmas album more than any other. I ripped it from the record onto a CD so I can enjoy it wherever I go. Actually, having the pops and occasional noises on my CD that were present on the record makes it even more special for me."
5,Please Re-Issue!,Please re-issue this CD! Grew up with this music and would love to have copies for the family. Love Mary's Little Boy Child!
5,trickortreat,"great old school movie for people from this generation, great sound track, classic hair metal, for the time the movie was made."
4,Softly-Played Sor,"After reading the wide spectrum of opinion expressed by the 3 previous reviewers, I decided to try this disc for myself. I had already purchased most of the other Sor (solo) discs on Naxos. Adam Holzman plays these pieces quite softly. Perhaps he is playing--as did Sor himself--without use of right-hand nails. However his effect is achieved, the music has a consistently gentle quality. While not as expressive as it might be otherwise, I certainly find his playing soothing and almost mesmerizing (my cat loves this CD). Another plus is that these works--two lengthy sonatas (Op. 22 & 25) and several short piece comprising Op. 23 & 24--all flow together nicely; in this respect, it's perhaps better than most other CDs in this series. Musically, these works shouldn't disappoint in the least--to me, they're all typical, high-quality Sor."
2,"I like Sor, but this music simply isn't good","I like Sor. In fact, in classical guitar, I like Sor more than I like Tarrega and Aguada. But the music on this album is simply dull and uninspiring. When I saw the title - ""Grandes Sonates"" - I thought I was in for a treat, as in ""Sonatas, and that, by Sor!"" - but the music disappointed. In addition to the sonatas, the other pieces are dull and lifeless as well. I definitely can't attribute this to the guitarist - it's just that the music isn't good. Just sounds like a beginning classical guitarist trying out a few tunes. No emotion, no passion, nothing whatsoever. I give it 2 stars instead of 1 because, well, the music is somewhat soothing, and gives kind of a nice ambience to the room."
3,self-satisfied narrator,"This book is beautifully written, but the main character, who also is the story's narrator, is self satisfied to the point of being obnoxious. I got tired of hearing how tolerant, patient, kind, adaptable, clever, tender, judicious, fair, etc. she is. I got tired of hearing how devoted she was to her perfect husband and how amazing she was to her children and her servants. Read Kay Gibbons, but not this book."
4,One to Read,"Other reviewers will summarize the plot for you -- let me just say that this is an extremely well-written book, with beautiful and haunting imagery, realistic dialogue and intriguing situations. I think the device of a woman looking back on her life on the occasion of her last afternoon on earth is quite brilliant. I read that Kaye Gibbons mentored Charles Frazier through his writing of Cold Mountain. This book is like Cold Mountain in that it shows war in all its grimy squalor and blows the myth that war is noble and pure. I enjoyed it very much, as I do most of Kaye Gibbons work."
3,somehow disappointing,"i fell in love with kaye gibbons writing when i read ellen foster -- her writing encapsulated everything i love about southern literature. easy prose -- but not simplistic, a great story, and memorable, wonderful characters. emma garnet and all the characters in ""my last afternon"" read like caricatures. the whole story has a shallowness that i wasn't expecting. it's like kaye gibbons had this wonderful idea, but just coudn't quite realize it in writing. none of the characters were particularly believable. her father was too horrible -- with no redeeming features, and her husband was too annoyingly perfect -- as were her chidren and her idyllic life as a married woman. the fact that she did not tell her servants that they were free did not, in fact, make me like her less, but was an indication that the author was trying to create a believable narrator that was a product of her time, rather than the creation of a 20th century mind. but that only exists as a hint."
4,Tears ran down my face,"It is a lovely book, poignant and sincere. I thoroughly enjoyed my reading. I recommend this book to anyone who may have even the slightest interest in the American Civil War and in the people (fictional and real) who lived through it."
4,"The Insider's Absolam, Absolam!","Upon picking up this novel, I immediately recognized the voice of Judith Sutpen, speaking to us about her father, Thomas Sutpen, alias Samuel Tate. Rosa Coldfield is there, too, in the person of Emma Garnet's mother, Alice. This is the story of what actually went on in that house described to us by William Faulkner in Absolam, Absolam! That part of the story is very good. My only disappointment came at the end, when Emma is carried away by Quincy Lowell (the handsome prince?). That seemed a little contrived. But all in all, I enjoyed reading the book and gaining an insight into the workings of the Sutpen, I mean Tate, household."
1,Disappointing and Obvious,"I should have been suspicious of the pages and pages of literary raves at the beginning of this book - including the one that says ""Better than Gone with the Wind"" Give me a break. This story seems to be a sanitized version of the civil war south. The sainted main character and her even more perfect husband seem to have an unlimited supply of money, energy and tolerance for every needy character they minister to during the war and never seem to lose their virtuous patience On the other hand, the character of Emma's father is purely bad, a foil to all that goodness I suppose. All in all you get no subtlety, no complexity and you as a reader gain very little believable insight into why these characters behave the way they do. On the other hand, you do get plenty of overt preaching about the evils of war and racism - Duh!"
2,What a let down,"Having read and enjoyed all of Gibbons' other books and I looking forward to this one. My stepfather read it first and loved it. I, however, did not. I didn't even finish it. It just wasn't as interesting as her other books. I just wasn't drawn in by the characters or the writing"
2,Civil War Stereotyping,"Brutish father, ailing mother, strong-willed oldest daughter, ill-starred son, stalwart servant, and, a rescuer from the North. No surprises, no insight, no complexity. While is it clear that Gibbons is attempting to convey one woman's intimate knowledge of the suffering wrought by slavery and paternalism, she oversimplifies the nature of the players, distilling the Civil War down to ""South bad, North good"". Gibbon's Emma Garnet and her busband, Quincy, are preachy to boot. Give me a genuine narrative any day."
2,A Disappointment,"Okay, I want to know what they have done with the real Kaye Gibbons - a woman who truly knows how to write. I am convinced she didn't pen this book. I kept checking to see if that really was her name on the cover. This was such a disappointment! I've read four of her five previous works and I am breathless to think that the woman who wrote Ellen Foster also wrote this flat, predictable, even annoying novel. These are some of the most one-dimensional characters ever, the situations often don't ring true and the moralizing becomes cloying. It is not up to Ms. Gibbons' standards as a writer, and not up to my standards as a reader."
5,A vivid look at the civil war from a fresh perspective,The dichotomy between the way Emma's father reared her and what she knew in her own heart to be true is the conflict that makes this book interesting. Fiction set in the civil war South tends to romanticize or demonize the characters. But Ms. Gibbons offers a realistic cast of three dimensional characters who as in life; are neither completely good nor entirely evil. Her depictions of twisted family relationships are hauntingly accurate. Is it possible that the author has met my family?
2,Yikes!,"I purchased 2..the orange as well as the fuchsia. The rubber ring on the inside of the lids would not stay in place no matter what I tried, and both leaked on me with each use."
3,"Solid & Smooth, but some Quality Concerns","A two foot square smooth cast iron table top combined with a very smooth spindle makes this machine very easy to work with. I measured the spindle runout to be 0.004 inches maximum for all spindles, except for the 1/4 spindle that was 0.013.My lower rating of only 3 stars is due to 3 quality issues. The top came with chemical stains, but was smooth and usable. I had to re-wire the switch... minor but should not have been required. And third, the table inserts are not flush with the table top. This can cause a piece of wood to catch as you are sanding with a resulting cup or glitch. Jet is sending me a new set of table inserts, but I have a feeling it is a poorly machined table top. I could easily shim the inserts, but for the price of the machine I expect it to be right and I want JET to know their quality control is slipping."
5,YOU Will Never Forget,"This is a true story of hate and ignorance, prejudice and misery that cost many millions of lives. Within a period of seven years six million Jews were starved to death, shot or gassed. It is a fearful and inhuman story--mostly heart-breaking, but with inspiring accounts, too, from the survivors and of the dead, of bravery and resistance. You'll never forget the Jews of the holocaust. (Suitable for junior high and up.)The Creative Teacher: Activities for Language Arts (Grades 4 through 8 and Up)"
5,a great book by a great friend,"A Different Breed Of Brotha was a masterfully written novel. It keep me wanting to turn the page and see what was going to happen next. I am a person that does not get a chance to read all the time, but books like this will make me find the time to read. If you have not read this book get it because it is a must. I cannot wait for the next novel by Stephens. He is a great author in the making. Somebody needs to give this man a contract now."
4,Read them out loud,"This was the first Bukowski I've read. The poems are less poetry-like and more short stories in columns. They've got a great rhythm. They're better when you read them out loud, which works better when you live alone. What amazes me is that this book is 405 pages long, and it's one of forty-five books by Bukowski, mostly books of poetry. That's pretty prolific. This one was published in 1992. There's a lot of poems about being old and getting ready to die. And a lot about drinking."
3,Read his novels first.,"Though LNOTEP has a couple of poems that are so good that theymake the whole book worth reading, most of the poems are completelyempty-- they just account meaningless little events observed bythe author. Try Run With the Hunted:A Charles Bukowski Reader forthe best of his poetry ,and novels, too!"
4,Very liquorishy,Don't know if I spelled that right or if it's even a word. We ordered this to fill up our $25 minimum to get free shipping and it is great. My husband thinks licorice is ambrosia so it was a great fine and we'd order it again.
2,"Looks good, but poor quality","I bought this for my 20 months old son since he likes truck so much. This one looks like the real one, but it is so fragile for playing. My son broke one of the mirror when he just touched the truck. I broke the rope for the door when i carefully tried to open the tractor door. I guess this product meant to be an exhibition for watching instead of a toy to play."
2,DID RECIEVE THE TRUCK I ORDERED,I ordered a black truck with blue flame (as the picture/description denotes) for my nephew for CHRISTmas. I received a white truck with with green flame.
5,Amy's difficult journey,"Barbara Jorgensen tells this story in such an honest, open way. It is hard to imagine how Amy must have felt enduring such hardship. She is a character to be admired in terms of how she finally learned how to deal with all that happened. It made me appreciate how much she had to overcome."
5,"Practical, to the point, spot-on.","This is the best book I have read on transactional analysis. It is straightforward, includes only what you really need to know and not all the good-to-know background research, and is full of examples that you immediately click with. I read it 8 years ago and I still find it relevant and spot-on today."
4,Great Buy,I really love this sofa. It is the perfect fit for my patio. The style is very designer friendly and it allows you to change colors and revap the sofa when ever you want. This product beats the Pottery Barn selection and I love it. The descriptions were absolutely accurate and I am utterly amazed by the quality of the product.
2,"Nice looking set, but sits way to low to the ground","I purchased this item for my outdoor space. Amazon was great with the quick shipping as the collection ( I purchased the entire sectional collection) arrived within 2 days. For a week it sat in the box in my dinning room and after taking it out the box, I immediately called Amazon for a return. While this is nice to look at, it is not practical at all . Its very deep, sits low the ground and the back is very tall. One would HAVE TO purchase pillows to go along the back. I had read all the other reviews before purchasing, but decided to buy regardless and take my chances. This time I should have listened to past reviewersI am sending this collection back and looking to order the faulker set by strathwood."
3,Wrong Part,"This part said it was compatible with our 2002 Chevy Tracker, but when trying to fit it in it was too wide. The part looked right, but it would not fit in properly, had to return. Make sure you don't make the same mistake."
4,disagree,"I totally disagree with the previous review. I rented it and my little boy just loved it. He even invented a game called ""The Keeper"" and they keep playing it all day long with his friends. i think this movie is not only entertaining, it teaches kids some valuable lessons about life and love."
3,"Not A-rated, but nice for children","A low-budget-film with a rather simple story. Acting is quite slow and stiff. Nearly no character development, only some with the boy (who is struggling with his destiny) and the girl (who, at a moment, vainly tries to escape her destiny).The special effects are not very special, possibly due to the low budget.There should have been more emotion in the film as the boy lost his parents.The music is not used well: at the thrilling moments the music makes you want to go asleep.So it is not an A-rated movie, but it may have been a brave first try.In spite of all this, I liked the movie because of the very nice picturing."
2,At least it was a free rental...,"I rented this from my public library, and spent 70 minutes laughing it. Maybe children under 4 who have no concept of cliched plots, bad acting, cheap props/costumes, low-tech special effects, and badly written scripts (which include lines such as: ""You ungrateful muscle-head!"" -Udo) might enjoy it. I know the movie makers weren't looking for aiming for an Academy Award and were just creating a movie that kids might enjoy, but the 4 and 6 year old children I was babysitting while watching this were laughing at the bad acting and cheesy plot lines. The 6 year old actually predicted the ending midway through because it was indeed that predictable.Overall, I must say I am glad that I rented this movie for free from my library, or I would have been angry. It provided a source of entertainment for myself and the kids, but not in a good way.Watch it, you might like it. But I seriously doubt it."
4,Navigating The Heart,"THEY HAVE CORRECTED THE PROBLEM MENTIONED IN THE OTHER REVIEWS. I too got the movie labeled Navigating The Heart but it was actually Natural Enemy (twice). Amazon was great about replacing and refunding and they notified the distributor about the problem. I then waited about a week and ordered it again because I had seen it on TV and liked it. I finally got the RIGHT DVD. I love this movie and got interested in the author of ""Fishing With John"", whose life this movie was based on, and ordered the book. Of course the movie was changed, as they always are, but both the the book and the movie are very good in my opinion and I would recomend it to anyone that likes romance stories."
3,Review for parents,"I researched this movie and could not find a rating or any parental guidance. It should be rated PG13. There is a storm scene on the boat where it looks like they might drown. The guy is in his underwear and is under a blanket with the girl with his legs around her. Also, the movie has a sex scene in it later on. Profanity consists of ""hell"" and ""damn."" I thought parents with young kids might want to know, because it starts out as if it would be OK, since it is about environmental concerns and fishing."
1,Only a few pages are worth looking at!,"I was excited to received the book after reading the reviews, however when I got the book, only a few pages was worth looking at. Most of the illustrations looked like something that I did in elementary school, with few exceptions. I guess the idea behind the book is to show you all the different medians you can use, some poorly done. Most of the illustrations looked like school assignment I rushed through so I have something to hand to the teacher. Very poor collection of works, I expected a lot more. I have to say, this was not work the 12 bucks I spent on it."
3,A decent game for only $5.00!,"I think this game was so so. I liked the first one better because I think it was more challenging and the game ran more smoothly. However, this game is pretty good too. It's definitly not the best game but it entertained me for few days. It was only $5.00 and you will enjoy it. The graphics are improved from the first game and everything else is about the same as the first game. It's like a decent expansion set for $5.00. Also I didn't have any technical issues so it should run fine on your PC just as it ran fine on mine. I think it's worth your money because it's only $5.00 but there are many better games for $10.00. So if you liked the first one than you should get this game but if you aren't satisfied with my review than it's safer bet that you should get No One Lives Forever for $10.00."
5,You do it for the Tenor,You get this version for Scotto!!!You get this for Bersonzi!There are NO interesting tenors left!
2,lids were difficult to remove,I thought these were exactly what I wanted but I was disappointed in these canisters. They were thin and flimsy. The lids were difficult to remove. When attaching the knobs one of the screws stripped out the knob and made it unusable. I returned my set.
1,Stainless Steel Treat Canister,Do not buy this item. The lid is so tight you can not get it off and on. I bought it for a gift but had to get rid of it because it was cheaply built.
4,review,Its worthwile to read ..update and interesting book..I will suggest to other people..makes you convinced for cure achieved with proper the diet..
2,No good.,It is not detailed and not much information in it to use. I would not recommend it to any one.
1,throws out the baby with the bathwater,"The author comes across as a self-appointed medical vigilante out to prove the entire allopathic medical community is wrong. While natural approaches to prostate health are worth promoting, his alarmist approach is not helpful. In particular, his repeated implications (or outright assertions) that conventional medical approaches (for prostate cancer) are synonymous with castration is ridiculous. His research into the role of testosterone is interesting but not convincing.I bought this book hoping for useful approaches to complement carefully researched ""conventional"" treatment for prostate cancer, but the author's opinion is that you can't use both. Hogwash. I'm returning this book."
4,Great Book!,"This is an excellent book written by Roger Mason on the male organ Prostate. This is a firm, partly muscular chestnut sized gland in males at the neck of the urethra; produces a viscid secretion that is the fluid part of semen. There have been instances of patients recovering very fast after reading this book. It is a highly informative book for one and all interested in finding more about Prostate. A person suffering from Prostate will definitely benefit more. If you want to prevent this happening to you as you age then you have to read this book.I read the book and I thought, this doesn't sound too bad, but I found myself miserable. I just was frustrated after a week....it was very regimented. [...] Another book I bought was the South Beach Diet book. I read that book and found the plan to be made up of things I would eat and the items were normal grocery store items so no hunting at the health food stores or buying online"
5,Fasinating and eye opening!,"Good reading, not just for film buffs only! Diana Serra Cary gives a rare, revealing glimpse into the world of children in show business.Although it's subject is early child film stars,it's message is very relevant to today's society as well.Well worth the effort!"
4,Hot Shot a great read,"HOT SHOT is a fast and entertaining read, if you liked Stephanie Plum you'll love Frankie Daniels. She gets into more trouble than the law allows. She had an affair with a married man (her ex-lover told her he was separated from his wife and getting a divorce). Frankie is oust to a very small and quaint town in North Carolina. When she arrives in town not only does she find her house is burnt to the ground but one of the best looking men she has ever seen is helping her out of a mud pile, only to find out that he is her boss.She takes on the town bully and wins, and this is just the first day.Frankie fights her attraction for her new boss (Matt), she fell for that once before.Between all the crime to solve and the bond she is forming for the town, Matt hopes that he is part of the picture, also.Charlotte Hughes has written a wonderful entertaining book. I look forward to reading more books by her in the near future."
4,Hot Shot Hit the Spot,"I was looking for a fun, quick read. This book definitely met my needs. It can be predictable, but still fun and full of romance and mystery. The best combination in my book!Frankie Daniels is a hard core detective in Atlanta and used to seeing gruesome crimes. Her MO is to not get involved and be the best at her job...trying to follow in her slain father's footsteps. After an error in judgement that cost her her job, she is moved to a small town. Once there, she encounters the menacing town bully, the Chief of Police (her boss), and many more characters of Purdyville. The story goes from there with love stories, a cast of wonderful characters, and mysteries to be solved.If you're looking for a well written book that leads you to a good time...this is one you should read."
5,HOT STUFF!,"HOT SHOT, by Charlotte Huges, is a hot story! A story I really enjoyed! The characters sizzle, the dialouge that of today, and the plot a real page-turner. A very appealing combination!John Savoy....Beverly Hills, California"
2,So many others are better,"The notes are uneven, the interpretations are odd, and as another reviewer pointed out, there are so many pianists who play them so much better. Try Berezovsky or Wild or one of myriad other sets out there, but set this one aside."
1,no way,"It's just a matter of opinion, but these interpretations (or lack thereof) are totally wrong. With all the other (tiresome) Chopin recordings out there, we need this one like we need a hole in our heads. It is barbaric and brainless. Yet another stupid and unnecessary recording of the Chopin Etudes.-------ADDENDUM: Apparently ""Prelude"" seems to think that if you don't like this recording, then you don't appreciate Chopin. ""Prelude"" insists that I need to back up my opinion, but fails to back up his/her own. To the buyer: DON'T LISTEN TO PRELUDE! PRELUDE IS OBVIOUSLY ATTACHED TO PENNEYS IN SOME WAY, AND HAS A BIASED OPINION. ""Prelude"" is also projecting his/her ""burnt"" past on to me. Would you trust the opinion of such a person?"
4,experience,"Augustus Pablo, recently deceased of a nerve disorder, was an influential dub artist with many good releases. This title gives a good representation of his work while also displaying his vast experience and inate talent. While, as with almost any album some tracks are stronger than others, I'll let you decide which. I can say however that this is a great overall album. If you are new to dub reggae or Augustus Pablo, this is a MUST have-you won't be sorry."
4,"Attractive, Sturdy","These cargo boxes are sturdy and attractive, and are very good for storing a variety of smaller items.A couple of points that aren't immediately obvious from the product description:- The lids are integral (permanently attached) to the box itself. The whole lid hinges at the back. This is not a terrible thing, and it is designed in such a way that it will probably last for many years. It just caught me off guard, as most boxes of this genre seem to have a separate and removable lid.- The dimensions listed are a bit off. This seems like a small point unless one is trying to fill a specific space with these boxes, at which point it becomes critical. Actual height is 3.25"", actual width is 4.75"", and actual depth is a hair over 10"" (depending on whether you count the drawer pull on the front or not). Hopefully this information will be helpful to someone in the future.Overall, I'm satisfied with these boxes."
1,Inappropriate Story,"I don't write reviews much, but this book bothers me. It's for kids right? So why would they want to read a story about a dog who needs to get a job otherwise ""We will have to send Clifford away"". Upsetting for kids to try and process the amount of dog food needed, the cost and, oh well, if we can't afford it we'll just get rid of it. And then he gets a job in the circus as a sideshow. Try explaining to a young child what a circus sideshow is... And finally, he chases robbers that are shooting bullets at police.Seriously, this book should be withdrawn form the market. There are many other stories worth telling over this one."
2,Bias and Hyperbole,"If you're looking for a concise overview of U.S.-Mexican relations (from the 16th Century to 1985) from the Mexican point of view, look no further. ""The United States and Mexico,"" part of the ""United States and the World: Foreign Perspectives"" series, concentrates like a laser beam on Mexican motives and interests. In addition, aside from a score of typos and a badly composed section on the Mexican War, the book is exceptionally well-written.However, if you're in the market for an accurate, balanced history of U.S.-Mexican relations, keep looking. ""The United States and Mexico"" will squander your trust and time with exaggerations, falsehoods, unsupported generalizations, and flagrant errors of judgment."
3,lathe on wheels,"this base unit just gives wheels to your jet 1236 lathe which is already on a stand to begin with. So if you really need to move it out of the way all the time, here you go. Otherwise (and if you have a benchtop model like the 1220 or 1014, you'll want jet's stand here:Jet 708354 JML-S Adjustable Mini Lathe Stand"
5,Best Chai Tea Out There!!,"Big Train is the best Chai Tea you can buy, I have been buying it in 3.5 lb bags from another source (hopefully Amazon will stock the big bags soon) and it is incredible!!"
4,Love it!,"I personally prefer smaller collections like this over large accumulations or double discs. I like to think it's the quality of the performance that's important, not the number of songs you're getting for your buck :-) Whenever I come across a large collection, I find myself skipping through at least a third of the tracks until I come to a recording I really like. I don't have to do this with this CD. It contains a really thoughtful collection of songs - and all are fantastic. They sound like ""early Dinah"", and perhaps not remastered as well as we are used to these days (released in 1990), but without a doubt, ""Willow Weep For Me"", ""Look to the Rainbow"", ""Smoke Gets in Your Eyes"" and ""What a Difference..."" I've never heard better, and well worth the purchase!"
1,The songs are great but this album is a ripoff,"If you are interested in the music of Dinah Washington, look elsewhere. This album clocks in at 25:24, which comes out to about $2.00 per minute if you buy it at retail price. Also, there are absolutely no production notes concerning recording dates or band personnel. All of these songs are easily available on other collections that have the sort of detail that aficionados of this singer and era look for, so unless you find this album at a garage sale for a dollar (like I did) just take a pass on it."
3,too nervous for my tastes,"I purchased this CD after hearing an interview with Brian Auger interspersed with some of his music. I was captivated by the voice of his daughter, and by one song in particular (by the same name as the album). She has a beautiful earthy and sultry voice, and the song itself has a great jazz arrangement.While I am happy with all the pieces she sings on this CD (and the title song is well worth the price of the CD), I find all the instrumentals a bit hyper in tempo and feel. I find myself getting more and more anxious while listening to the instrumentals ... and I am generally not an anxious person! It's a shame ... all are great musicians, and while I do like upbeat stuff, this feels like it was recorded on meth."
5,Great Adventure,The fact that Early was able to make this raid is in itself a miracle. This is by far the most entertaining and best researched book on this subject. It offers great fun and deep understanding of this most important Civil War action. Early is a complex figure and Vandiver shows us the person under the facade.
1,A Dead Person Speaks,"My name is Esther and I had permission to return from the heaven above, to present the true story about this book, which was written about me. This book was composed of my thoughts, my words, my images and the flagrant usage of my pictures and letters, which I have never consented for the author's use to publish. This author in her book professes to take credit for her autistic caregiving advise to other's from my disease. Her relationshoip with me was meaningless, for I spent very little time with her while I was suffering from my condition and it was due to my daughter's fervent daily companionship for 5yrs. at the nursing home's, that kept me alive during my 95th birthday, until I died. It's unfair when one writes about your life's story when you are dead and you are unable to refute their creditability. But I had to aware the publisher of this travesty and hopefully I could return to heaven in peace.Esther"
5,Wonderful toy . . .,My 9 month old son loves these blocks. They are his old standby toy . . .it never fails he always finds himself playing with them.
3,"Wonderful music, annoying download","I've always loved ""Sylvia,"" and this is a fine performance. That said, why can't I download it so that the music plays in the proper order? My idiot computer does not know that this is a two disk set, and so it organizes the tracks as disk one, track one, disk two, track one, disk one, track two, disk two, track two, and so on. MP3 downloads and players are so ubiquitous now that I don't understand why publishers of these CD's can program the tracks so that they will enter a user's library in the correct order."
4,hammer note,good hammer for pounding nails. would like a side nail puller. not good for the usual demo work i also use a hammer for. easy on the arm.
5,Wonderful Recording,"This is magnificent violin playing of two neglected works. Absolutely beautiful, romantic writing and the playing is wonderful. don,t miss this one!!!"
1,Poor packaging = broken product,This relatively fragile acrylic tube was shipped to me in an ENVELOPE. Unsurprisingly it arrived smashed. I would not order from this company again due to their extremely poor packaging choice.
3,Awwwwesome,"I trucked through all the games a while ago.These are difficult, eat many hours.Not so much a hack and slash though there is plenty of fighting in it.You spend a lot of time just figuring out puzzles and doing tasks for someone to get somewhere orrecieve something in return.I went through as a thief, with that I had access to the thieves guild while still being able to fight welland use magic.This game(s) dated though i will certainly go back and bash through them again, especially 1+2"
1,only if you like piano music,"Every song on this album is piano music. It is very boring. Some of the melodies would be ok if they had a full band. With just a piano, pretty much all of the songs sound the same. I feel like I'm in a piano lounge at a seedy bar listening to this CD."
2,Book felt choppy,"This book was split into three sections to tell the complete story. All three seemed too rushed and even though I usually love Kasey Michaels, the book seemed amateurish and not very well written. It was my least favorite of the Maitland Maternity books I have read."
2,Lathe usage,"Have been using the Jet JWL-1236 for about 8 months now. The first thing you should do is throw the base away and build one with substance. Might be satisfactory for turning spindles but not for anything with any kind of mass unless you secure it to the floor. I do a lot of bowl turning and anything you might have to turn outboard is a joke, especially with the equipment that is furnished with the lathe. Unless you have the capability to ensure something is pretty well balanced don't try to turn it outboard. One problem is that the lathe speed is still too fast even at its lowest setting and the ON/OFF switch is in the wrong place if you have to get to it in a hurry. If you are truly interested in turning bowls of any size save your money and buy something a little more substantial in size and has a true variable speed capability."
3,Great for beginners. . . but not much else,"I would recommend this guide to middle school students and possibly early high schoolers. The dictionary itself is indeed ""easy on the eyes,"" with clean white paper and large, clear text. The price is good. However, a word of caution: it has a rather weak vocabulary, which is its biggest flaw. If it were more extensive (much more), I would give it 5 1/2 stars. As it is, though, I found myself shopping for something more powerful; I went to France and had to rely on another dictionary for most of my translations."
3,"Good but, needs more","This CD has all the basics. However, it only has the short version of Do it Til You're Satisfied and not the disco remix of Express. Very dissapointing."
2,BT Express on the Local Track,"This CD has all the hits but cheats you by giving only the short versions of Express and Do It ('Til You're Satisfied). In fact, the best part of Do It is cut out. True fans will find this a disappointment."
3,Scientific claims sketchy but consistent with others who are,"are writing on this subject. Read _The Yeast Connection_, by Dr. William Crook (and _The Yeast Connection and the Woman_, _The Body Ecology Diet_, by Donna Gates, _The Food Doctor_, by Vicki Edgson Dipion and Ian Marber Dipion. Also, _Potatoes, Not Prozac_.The author does seem bent on this one cause and, therefore, many of the conclusions feel incomplete. There is much good in this book. Especially the list and categories of foods.Take it from one who lost most of the ""evil"" symptoms of sugar poisoning by eliminating it for one year. Thought I was becoming diabetic, passed out almost every afternoon and woke up with a hangover, had symptoms of MS, had a red rash on my face, itched all over, ached all over, cried all the time, had symptoms of bipolar disorder. You name it. They all disappear in my life when the sugar does.If you suspect you have a problem read any book on the symptoms of sugar addiction."
2,"fast delivery, but not as advertised.","Book arrived promptly, condition not as advertised; book contained some writing inside; should have had a different classification."
1,Get a real book,"This book was awful. I read ""The Sugar Addict's Total Recovery Program"" (DesMaisons) first, and I was spoiled by more rational, documented approach to the subject. To be fair, I only got through the first part of this book before I put it down in disgust. This book is the rantings of someone who feels passionately about something. Great. Now back it up. You can't just say, ""This is bad and you have to do this!"" Well... I suppose you can. But in my opinion that makes for a lousy book for someone who is trying to learn and separate fact from hysteria."
4,Hello Mary Lou: Prom Night 2,Glad that now that the remake of the original Prom Night is in theatres that they finally decided to release Prom Night 2 to DVD. It was always one of my favorite Prom night stories with it super natural aspect of a dead prom queen possessing a high school girl and trying to live the dream of being queen she was denied when she died in the school gym fire in 1950s. A lot better concept than a mere serial killer. My only problem is the same as with most 1980s horror movies. That is the DVD box art. I find it weird that 1980s had the most fantastic VHS box cover art and often some of the worst DVD box cover art.
3,Hello Mary Lou: Prom Night II DVD,"For a Movie that cost $5.00 and one I remember seeing growing up, it's not bad, it's not very scary, it is at times a little funny and silly, there is full frontal nudity,the film is a b-movie yes,but it's not horrible. the special effects could have been better. But it's vintage 1987!"
3,Its a sequal....,"I have seen this movie And don't mind it.... Its not a blockbuster, but if your bored on a sunday between 9 and 10:30, then here you go. Don't expect the Titanic to role around the corner... But I Loved the Music in it.... If anyone knows the name of the song being played while they are in the Cafe... ""Soul City...thats where were goin'...""yadda yadda yadda... email me.... Axlaiden"
3,"Better than Prom Night, but not perfect!","I hadn't seen this movie since it came out. I ordered the DVD and wasn't at all disappointed with the transfer! Picture quality is very good but audio is either Mono or two-channel surround. The two-channel surround is the better choice though and compares with the theater viewing.The movie itself is a good slasher flick, although the 80s were abundant with much better ones than this!Michael Ironside is his typical self, is he a good guy or bad? Always hard to know with him.The best scene is near the beginning when Mary-Lou is accidentally burned to death.The rest has some tense moments but not all that scary.If you enjoy mild horror films, this one will do. If your tastes are a little edgier, then don't waste your time.I ordered this on Amazon for $7.99 but it is also available at WalMart stores for $5.00."
3,Cookie Cutter,This is a Carrie- type cookie cutter film but worth a view once or twice. Mary Lou is burned to death after being named prom queen. Now 30 years later the culprit is now principal. Vicki is a candidate for prom-queen. Mary Lou's spirit tries to reclaim her prom queen title at last. Vicki adopts Mary Lou's habits and destroys all who stands between her and prom queen title. I wouldn't recommend it except for horror enthusiasts.
1,Give it a pass for another more comprehensive Vegas guide,"If you know where you want to get married in Vegas already, then you should not bother with this book. IF you do not have a location in mind, then this book is for you, but a bit outdated. You can find most if not all of this informaiton online, but if you like a book to hold in your hands then this is a good book to have.It did not suit me because I had previously researched the location and place and decided where I wanted to be married. The book didn't give me anything that I didn't already have."
5,Life is ....,"complicated, never as black and white as we wish. A great vacation book. Both likeable and entertaining."
2,it went downhill fast,"I really liked this book in the beginning but as it progressed, it become so unbelievable! Why does her husband not own a cell phone as a lawyer in the present day and why does she not try harder to find/call him when he is missing for days with their child? There are other things at the end of the book that are very hard to swallow as well but it would give away too much of the story to detail them. I was disappointed because the story was good until it hit a point towards the end where it went downhill and really lost me."
3,"Thoroughly unlikeable main character, but well written","Elayna, the main character is a selfish, self indulgent stereotype of the artsy New Yorker who finds herself a suburban housewife, is mildly judgemental of her own lifestyle and proceeds to ruin it all by having a fling with the (yawn) hot young neighbor boy.She's a mom who ignores a serious risk to her daughter, a wife who takes her husband for granted, and generally just not a likeable character.That said, it is a credit to the author that the reader feels so strongly about this woman, b/c it's a credit to her writing skills."
2,"Elayna is a pathetic, weak, despicable person","Yes, she has a lot going on and yes her husband buried himself in work and yes her neighbor is attractive...but there is ABSOLUTELY no justification for having a fling. She is a weak and pathetic wife. Why wouldn't she simply talk to her husband and say ""Honey, I am feeling really lonely because of how much you are working. I love you and I miss your company, and I'm starting to feel distant?"" That is what any normal, mature adult would do.An artice of Cathi's that I just read in Tango about dating proves that she is an immature adult, stuck in the 10th grade. She actually advised a girl who has been dating the same guy for 10 years and who is still crazy about that guy to try and ""see other people"" before they get married so she won't regret anything.Morons like Cathi Hanauer make having a normal, stable, loving relationship and drama-free dating experience IMPOSSIBLE. SHe needs to die."
2,It was a well done CD but in hungarian,The CD had all the songs I was looking for but they were all in Magyar. Unless you speak magyar I don't sugest it
5,My Favorite Album of 2002....so far,"Captiol K's 'Island Row' is in constant rotation for me right now. I can't get enough of the intense melodies, glitched out beats, and earnest lyrics. Normally I would not be into an album like this, I tend to like my IDM with out any lyrics what so ever. Honestly, this is the first time I have ever heard it pulled off right. This is what Radiohead (Kid A/Amnesiac) would sound like if they could ever enjoy themselves...they are excellent, but perpetually depressed. The album actually sort of reminds me of Jane's Addiction...although I doubt anyone will notice that. I was in line at the record store buying one of the Orb's two disc albums of remixes, when they staff was playing this. I knew this was what I needed. Hell, even the cover art is great. Buy this album, you will not be disappointed."
2,wonderful series ruined by distracting music,"José Andrés is an amazing chef and a tremendous personality. There is nobody doing lifestyle television in America who's better qualified to talk about Spain or more fun to watch. The episodes are well thought out and beautifully shot.But none of that matters due to the loud, mediocre, pseudo-indie music layered over 70% of the action. It's distracting to the point of being completely unbearable -- like sitting down to a beautiful meal at a 3-star restaurant and then finding that the people next to you can't stop farting."
2,Wireless headphone,The headset had a lot noise in them and unless you were directly in front of the set it was hard to hear. I may of gotten a bad set. I know the rca set I have a sony set a friend has are both as clear as a bell you don't have the interference at all.
2,Big Disappointment,This book has only a few pages of text/instructions. Transfer designs are simplistic and none are illustrated. No pictures; all in black and white. I did give it two stars because it documents the basic embroidery stitches - although even they are not that clear. IMHO - not worth the shipping and handling.
2,Lukewarm,"I was a little dissapointed when I received this book. It does contain a lot of iron-on transfers, but there are no color pictures of any of the designs in the book, which are always good to get those creative juices flowing. The designs in the book are definitely for beginners. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who is at an intermediate or advanced level with silk ribbon embroidery."
2,Don't waste your money,"This has to be one of the worse transfer pattern books ever! The patterns are too small, uninspiring, and too much alike!! There is just no creativity to be found here, this book ended up in the trash, it wasn't worth giving to Goodwill."
4,Does what it says!,"While ""gentle"" is not necessarily the word I would use to describe a regimen of colosan, it really does work wonders for flushing out the GI tract. The first day I was extremely tired and nauseous, with probably 6-8 bouts of very watery waste (had to call into work the next day as I was afraid to leave my house!). Day 2 was better, but still intense. I kept up the dosage twice a day for 5 days, then switched to a Total Cleanse product for whole body detoxing. I now feel energized, clean, healthy, and no more cramping or bloating! The taste and consistency leaves something to be desired, but it really does work. Just be prepared to take a sick day or two while starting out on it."
1,colosan reaction,I used an oygen-type colon cleanse many times. I switched once to Colosan and it burned me. It has been 6 months now and my vulva area is in burning pain constantly and very painful to walk.
2,"This is an 11-inch mirror, not 12","If you are looking for a 12-inch wide mirror, this is not it. It is 11 inches wide. Quality is okay but not as sturdy as original part."
2,I Concur With Two Other Reviews,"Mirror received with extremely loose arm that connects to mirror body. I turned the arm about 90 degrees and the arm separated from mirror with the nut rattling around and inaccessible inside the mirror. I returned the defective mirror and am awaiting another replacement mirror (same). I don't have a lot of confidence that the replacement mirror will be any better. We'll see.The mirror is only 11 inches wide, not 12 as listed in the specifications. I wish that the mirror was a bit wider in both axes."
1,Ordered and Returned Two Defective Mirrors,This mirror ships from the factory defective. A plain nut affixes the arm to the mirror casing. In both units I received the nut had dislodged from the threaded arm and was rolling around in the completely sealed mirror unit. Repair is impossible because you cannot access the nut. If CIPA had used a nylock nut or some loctite on the threads the nut would not work itself off.
4,WOW!,"The book is great, although I found it not quite as enjoyable as the others in the series.It is still an incredible book, and is worth the money.If you enjoy the other Spy X books, you will find this to be a worthy addition to the series."
4,High Fantasy at its best,"Lately I was in the mood for some High Fantasy, and I went searching online for recommendations. One of the tops suggestions was this book. It was excellent.The story begins with magic, death and the overthrow of non-human overlords by their human slaves. The story then picks up over 2000 years later, in an age of humans and little apparent magic. It certainly doesn't seem like your typical D&D; story. The world looks more like a medieval realm than a fantasy world, until saints begin intervening and death comes to the king's forest.The Briar King introduces the reader to characters who will clearly be the ""main players"" in the rest of the trilogy. The author, Gregory Keyes, did an excellent job not only of developing their back stories and compelling the reader to care, but also created a rich world with a complex but comprehensible history. There IS magic and mystery, along with honor and betrayal. Everything that makes High Fantasy great."
5,wow,"I wasn't sure what to expect from thid book. I've read a lot of good fantasy, but also a lot of not so good. This was a pleasant surprise.The series just gets better as it goes!"
3,First Half is Great,"The first third of this book is amazing, the second third is okay and it grinds down from there. Keye's written style is really interesting but the characters are mostly wooden. Really enjoyed the opening but had absolutely no desire to continue the series."
2,It was free; still not worth it.,"I got this book for free on Kindle and it still wasn't worth it. Nothing in the story is original. The only real attempt at originality is the creation of new words and phrases (substitutes for ones we already have in English), which distract and annoy more than it serves to create an exotic atmosphere. There isn't even a mini-story to make you feel like finished the first novel. It's all just a set-up to get you to read the rest of the series. If they are anything like this book, I'll pass even if they're offered for free."
4,Creative,"Mr.Keys has written a very creative book, with interesting characters.It was easy able to over look the flaws (in my opinion), and to enjoy reading the Briar King.It will take a great effort to make book 2 as good as book 1, and i hope he succeeds. (I am looking forward to the next one.)It is always great when a new author arrives in the fantasy world. good book."
5,Great Read,"For someone who doesn't have enough time to read Martins books... Loved the first, but you have to re-read the thing by the time the next comes out... just lost intrested by the 3 book... This book gives you a shorter book... Not such a huge array of folks to keep up with... I got into the book quickly, couldn't wait to finish the next chapter and was not effected by the length... I've been reading fantasy, ever since fiest came out with Magician and for me, good books are hard to find and this is one of'em!"
3,AN INTERESTING BUT UNEVEN START FOR A NEW AUTHOR,"Understand that this author is new to fantasy and this is his first stab at writing in such a genre. So, while this was compared to George R.R. Martin's SONG OF ICE AND FIRE series, understand it doesn't come close.That said, this is an honest start with solid promise in the future.GOOD POINTS(1) Lots of time spent on a believable History;(2) good cast of character;(3) it moves;(4) author is good at creating emotional affects; especially fear and curiousityBAD POINTS(1) dialogue needs work. While it doesn't suck it lacks complexity and nuances that we expect in dialogue;(2) Some of the characters, like the dialogue, needs development. Lots of archetypes for those who like it;(3) a few plot holes.This novel will be helpful in assisting me with my writing as I can use it to George R.R. Martin to compare pieces. Sometimes you learn more from a novel, that needs some improvement, than something as flawless as George R.R. Martin."
5,"Martin and Jordan, watch your back!","Impossible to put down. Action, myth, and sympathetic characters are seldom weaved together so seamlessly. As the farflung storylines of the various main characters slowly come together, the tension of the book escalates. Some characters hold the pieces to the mystery that others desperately need in order to survive. And, as with Martin's books, I knew that Keyes wouldn't hesitate to kill off a main character.Keyes' knowledge of the importance of myth within culture is what gives his story its flexible backbone--and sets it apart from the millions of fantasy sagas that rely merely on a prophecy to set the stage for the actors to do their thing.Can't wait for book two."
5,The Fantasy Epic is Back!,"I admit of late I have been ignoring epic fantasy because of the stuff really is leaning on the ... side, but low and behold I read this book and I really very happily surprised at how wonderful it is. For once the king is fighting to put his daughters on the throne, the female characters are just as intelligent and spiffy as the male characters, the royal family actually comes off as a family, one with as familiar problems to the rest of us and more, the plot has plenty of twists that you didn't see coming by chapter 2, a great fast pace, great dialogue, and a great balance of drama and some great humor. And you actually like the like the good guys. I really recommend reading it."
2,ebook with serious formatting problems,"Fair to middling. There's entertainment to be had. Not sure if I'll read the rest of the series. Maybe.This ebook had a few serious formatting problems. Paragraphs were unevenly and randomly indented. Scene cuts, or whatever they're called -- where there's an extra space between two paragraphs and usually a shift of some sort, in POV or space or time -- were not marked. One very different scene slid clumsily into another. It was very disorienting, and there's just no way it could have been deliberate. I expect and forgive these kinds of problems with self-published books but I don't think Del Rey should be making such simple formatting mistakes.Note: I read this on the Kindle app for iPad. It may be the case that these problems only show up on that platform, I dunno."
2,Not as good as I hoped,"I saw all the great user reviews on this and thought I'd try it. However, it just didn't work for me. Every chapter was predictable and the characters seemed trite and shallow. It is rare that I start a series and have no desire to finish it - but this is one series that I won't bother with."
4,Another epic fantasy series is off to a good start,"Mr. Keyes has opened up his new series with a fast-paced and frantic volume. As is typical of many epic fantasy works, the first volume of the Kingdoms of Thorn and Bone is filled with character and location introductions. That doesn't detract from the story as the book, while being the first of a four-part series, is a novel unto itself."
2,Two thumbs down,If your a fantasy enthusiast I wouldn't recommend it. It's just watered down. Starts off good and like many books loses momentum. Reminds me of about 10 books I've already read.
3,Good start to a new fantasy series,"This was a good book. Solid characters. The story moved along at a good pace. My only criticism is that sometimes the characters use words or discuss things that aren't explained really well. Overall, a good story and I look forward to reading the sequels."
4,Something to hold me over until Feast for Crows comes out,"I must say that I had a much better time with this book than I have had with any fantasy book since I finished ""A Storm of Swords."" This book and this author may not have Martin's ability with the language but don't let that fool you. Even though the book makes a mention 4 main heroes the 4th guy(the swashbuckler) really doesn't do much.The characters are likeable A forester, A young novice priest and a young knight. I try not to compare this to Song of Ice and Fire but it is sort of unavoidable.So now my list of favorite authors readsGeorge R. R. MartinGreg KeysTerry BrooksOverall-If you are starved for good fantasy make sure you pick this up."
4,Good and Bad Things to Say,"A lot of people compared this to George R. R. Martin. I can see that--it's very ambitious, and there are many story lines that have to be pulled together. For me, there are two main differences between the two.The first is that I prefer GRRM's style of writing. There is nothing wrong with Keyes' writing, but I grew frustrated with the way every chapter ended with a cliffhanger, often a misleading one. After a while I didn't care if the chapter ended with someone about to be stabbed, because I figured it was a trick to get me to keep reading. I found that gimmicky. Second, I didn't think the characters were as deeply drawn as GRRM's.Having said that, I bought all four books for my kindle and read them all, so I guess I did care what happened to everyone.Second, there is one very important advantage The Briar King has over A Song of Ice and Fire: It's finished!! You won't be waiting six years to find out what happened. I feel Keyes should be appreciated for that."
4,Excellent start to a promising new series,"Like other reviewers I was skeptical about starting this series. I knew nothing about Greg Keyes, nor have I read any of his prior works before reading this book. The reason I picked up this book was because Terry Brooks recommended it on his website, as well as on the cover of the book itself, so I decided to try it out. I was overall very impressed with this story, and look forward to the future installments. The characters, plot, background set up and overall story/storytelling are very good. I cannot wait to read Charnel Prince to see where the story will lead from this book, and what will happen to the characters. The only reason I did not give it a 5 is because it lacked the extra ""oomph"" to make it a 5. However, this series has so much potential to be really good that I recommend it to anyone wanting to start a new and intriguing fantasy series."
3,"A little shaky, but I'm going to read the next one!","The writing is intense, exciting, passionate and realistic but the pacing and character development requires patience and careful reading. The underlying mythology (the fantasy behind the fantasy, as it were) is not well explained but will perhaps become clearer as the entire series unfolds."
2,"Don't bother reading, unless you are desperate","his book was such a piece of crap that I had to double check on my Kindle if I even finished it. As far as I can recall, there are some people.. they do stuff.. fantasy novel set in medieval times.. briar king is 'bad' and comes along.. spooooky... stuff.. evil animals?I think it's part of a trilogy. If the second and third were free to download, maybe I would. They are not free, though, so I will not download them and read them. I do not recommend this book - you are better off reading the Game of Thrones series.This book was recommended by those desperately waiting for the next in the Game of Thrones series. I say you are just better off reading something else, or re-reading the series (for the third time, like me).Briar King - such a cool concept and title, such poor execution. :("
4,Really glad I found this one . . .,"I've read the reviews that people left for this book and I almost didn't read it. Maybe I'm not as discerning a reader as most but I have to say that I really enjoyed it. I might be convinced to agree that it was not as ""deep"" as ""A Game of Thrones"" but it has captivating characters, fantastic action, and an intricate plot. I usually judge a book on the first few chapters and I was hooked before I even read the first few pages. I am looking forward to reading the next book in the series."
1,A bad deal all around.,"I wouldn't recommend this software to anyone, your muchbetter off with Windows 2000, owing to the glaringsecurity hole that centers around 'remote desktop'which Microsoft refuses to fix. Also this softwarecan only be reinstalled a maximum of 20 times, a verybad deal indeed if you get computer viruses often.Don't waste your money on this shoddy productbest to look somewhere else for an operating system.I give it one star for bad quality and poor usability."
4,windows xp sp2,Everything was fine except the price. The price lowered to 29.95 about three weeks after I purchased it for 49.95.
5,XP Windows Review,The material came in a timely manner and was installed on my computer. It is working fine. Thank You. Richard Hyde
4,MS XP Home Addition,Received in good order and installed without a hitch.I just with Microsoft would standardize on a look and feel. The OS shock from XP extending to Windows 8 make me long more and more for Linux.
1,WARNING,"This is only an UPGRADE. You must have an existing Windows OS on your computer, and it can't be too old, or this product is useless to you.This probably seems obvious to most people, and you probably think I'm an idiot, but there are some of us who have no idea how this crap works, or miss that one little word upgrade in the description. If Amazon could have warned me the way I just warned you (like they used to warn you if you're buying DVD's for a region other than where you live), I would have saved the money. Because naturally I can't return it once it's been opened and my son tried to install it and found it wouldn't. And of course no one wants to buy this product from me because it's obsolete anyway."
3,surprised by the stability,"Of course this software didn't install as advertised; I had to bootfrom the CD drive to get it installed, but after a couple of hours of tweaking I have an OS that is reasonably stable, unlike that piece of garbage Windows ME which had been running my computer for five years. Can't say that I loved the process of setting XP up, but the results are better than I expected. Perhaps my next computer will also run Windows."
3,Upgrade to an existing OS only.,"A friend of mine donated a computer to a charity. It was a system with a fractured Windows 98 system on it. I decided to upgrade it to XP, so I bought this product.The documentation leads you to believe that you can do a clean install of XP even if there is no OS on the system. You can't.The second best option is to do an install of XP over an existing OS, using the existing OS to boot up, but then using this CD to remove the old OS and install a fresh XP installation. You can't.What I had to do was do a clean install of Windows 98 (luckily I have the CDs and the knowledge to do this) and then upgrade it using the XP CD.So if you are looking for a clean installation of XP, this is not the product for you. However, if you know how to do a clean install of Windows 98, then this system will work for you."
5,Best Windows OS Ever!,"I have been using Windows since Windows 95, and have used every OS since. I have XP on my laptop and it is the best! I've been reading reviews saying that XP is bad, and I have NEVER encountered a problem. If you want an OS that will do everything you need, then get XP now before they get rid of it. Just so you know, I think Vista is trash. XP is better."
2,Microsoft Upgrade Review,"I attempted to install on one of my computers that was operating on windows 98. It would not install and kept giving me errors. I then installed it on my other computer that was running off of windows ME and it installed just fine. When I went to activate the software, it would not let me. I spent three nights on the phone with customer service for a total of six hours and finally ended up uninstalling and getting product replacement. Good luck with your purchase! Hopefully it works better than mine did."
1,Windows XP Home Edition Upgrade,I upgraded from windows 98 2nd edition because of crashes and stalls in this older program. I have spent 10 days and paid over $300.00 for professional troubleshooting to get me running again. I would never repeat this mistake again. I have used computers and PC's since 1985 and have had numerous problems which we all experience. This episode with XP reinforces my bad opinions about bloatware in general and Microsoft in particular.
1,This is crash-tac-ular,"It's a little late for a review, but I just had to do another clean install of this. Every year or so another clean install, because the computer (and I've gone through several with xp) won't work anymore. And hours go by, with virus scans and trying to do system restores (which is worthless, because you can't restore to the point before the problem began...you never can)This suckswith 2 newer OS's out my micrsoft I know the review is way to late, but just wanted to give my opinion on how much this sucks.and no...I will not give microsoft more moneybesides Bill Gates and his wife are eugenics freaks"
1,"Windows XP Upgrade a ""total bust""","This upgrade (from Windows 98SE) was a total disaster! The upgrade took about 45 minutes to reach the point where it displayed the message that it could not continue and complete. After about two more attempts (including reformatting my hard drive and re-installing Win98SE) and getting to the error message display even earlier! I finally contacted MS help via telephone. Eventually, a supervisor at Microsoft intervened and sent me a ""full-up"" Windows XP Home Edition which installed without a hitch."
4,The Amazon Product Description is Wrong!,"This product is an upgrade from other, older versions of Windows, such as 98, 98 SE, and ME. It is NOT meant as an upgrade for XP itself. You can get Service Pack 2 from Microsoft for FREE. If you own XP already, don't buy this. If you own an older OS, don't be put off buy the incorrect information in the Amazon description. XP is a great home OS, much better than what you have today!"
5,Excellent Operating System,"I had been experiencing problems with Windows 98 --occasional lockups, especially in browsing (ddhelp issues) and messages that the browser was not going to be supported on websites. Of course Win98 is not being supported by Microsoft.So I purchased this product, once installed it has worked perfectly, no lockups at all or browser issues, it seems to be a very huge improvement over my previous computer issues. It updates automatically, seems to work smoothly with my older programs, and is also apparently faster on browsing. I am very happy with it!"
5,Very Easy,This upgrade was very easy to do. Took about 90 minutes. I had no problems at all. Instructions were easy to follow. I would recommend this upgrade even if your computer is a relic like mine. It was well worth the $96.00 I paid for it.
5,Better than $120.00,"Wanted an upgrade from Windows 2000 Pro, but didn't want to pay full price. Found a used upgrade here. Glad I looked!"
4,Item received on time and as described,"I received the Windows XP UPGRADE on time and it is as the seller specified. I have yet to opened and use the upgrade disk as I bought it for future use. Many newer PC sw products will not work with my current PC OS (Windows 2000 PRO) and finding compatible products is getting more and more difficult to find. When finding an anti-virus product that runs with Win2000 is no longer possible, upgrading to WinXP will solve the problem."
4,Good for macs,"I bought this produst for mac's (because some programs does not run of Mac OS) and in my opinion runs just like what it should do as if it was a PC. I would give is near perfect, but the instalation takes a while to install, so anyone trying this might try installing either at night or any time during a long (1-2hrs) spare time. Aside from that, high marks."
4,Pleased,"So far, I am very pleased with this item and the shipping time.My opinion is,I would buy again from Amazon.com."
3,Operating System,Dose not support ULBA as a 250Gb hd and has lots of errors in in instulation on 250gb hd
5,Very pleased,My order came on time. The vendor sent me an email letting me know how to contact her before I received the Windows XP at a very fair price. She told me why she was selling it. I would use this vendor again.
4,Good windows product,Item works as expected for upgrading from ME version and transferring existing configurations successfully. Nice stable environment now and other software works when previous version of windows did not.
1,Microsoft Windows XP Home Edition Upgrade with SP2,"Terrible upgrade. It made my computer run very very slowly. Had to remove it, now my computer will not turn off properly. Also I get an error message that a file cannot be found when I turn the computer on and also I get error messages now when trying to open internet explorer.Would not recommend. Have spoken to others that had the same problem after they loaded XP."
4,make sure you have FAT 32 & NTFS (drives C & D)!,"...it installed very easily & let me download & upload Windows XP & Windows XP Service Pack 2 two different times but my desktop E Machine with original Windows 98 Second edition (now overwritten) only has a drive C...this means i only have 2% drive space left (because of all the Windows Updates)...it is working very well but now i have to figure out how to create more drive space (another location)[this E machine gave me no indication of this at all] so it's either a partition (drive C:0 drive C:1) or an extra hard drive!...it wasn't the programs fault, it works very well but it won't partition the drive for you, or I can't figure it out!"
5,This book was AWESOME!,"I liked this book because it was not afraid to be gory and scary. I don't like many book, but I really liked this one. Kids who are not big readers will like Paul Zindel, my favorite author."
1,"Good for laughs, at least. . .","Perhaps I may be outside this book's target audience (being a nineteen year-old college dropout with an interest in dinosaurs as animals, not bloodthirsty killing machines, and books written by someone with a degree of actual talent), but I'm barely into the second chapter and I already hate it. Please, if you value your brain, do not read this book. If you crave good dino-fiction, read Dinotopia Lost by Alan Dean Foster, Jurassic Park by Micheal Crichton, ANYTHING but this. If all you want is blood and gore, then by all means, pick this one up."
5,a great action packed book,My book is an action packed thriller called raptor!It start's off at new mexico when a kid moves there with his archeoligist family.and got a surprise of a lifetime his father finds a nest while exploring the new mexico caverns.he finds a huge surprise an unhatched raptor egg.Who he thinks his students put there as hoax.But little does he know that that egg will turn into his and his son's worst nightmare.
5,This book rocks,I ahd to read this book for a book report in school thinking it was another stupid dinosaur book for little kids.This book is awesome!I think this book is good for kids 10 and older and for people whoo like books that are a little gorey and violent.(...)
5,Barney's Vicious Relatives!,"This book was a non-stop roller coaster of a thrill ride! It follows young Zack & his native friend Uta as they try to ""rescue"" a baby raptor, ""Honker"", who has been ""captured"" by his mother & brought to the caverns where the dinos live on.All the while an evil paleontologist tries to capture some of the live dinos in an attempt to become world-famous. But he hasn't seen Blackback, a super-evolved Velociraptor with claws & teeth & horns & talons galore!*please note that this book does contain a heavy amount of gore!"
5,My favorite Zindel book.,This is by far my favorite book written by Zindel. Mainly because I have a fascination with dinosaurs. I thought that there was a constant supply of action and you will find it challenging to put the book down. I think it is well worth the few hours it might take to read. Anybody who does not read this book will be greatly missing out. The action starts off right away when the Raptor attacks Zach's father. There is never a dull moment. This is an awesome book!!
3,"does the job, but overpriced","I bought this because we just installed laminate floor in our den and I wanted to put this under our shoe bench so that thefloor would stay clean. It holds 3 pairs of mens shoes and is the perfect size to fit under my storage bench. I only gavethis 3 stars because it is a thin plastic and I feel at $17, this is not worth the price. I think is should cost no more then $9 for the small size and weight of the plastic."
2,Plastic Cheap Boot Tray,Although larger than I expected this is a plastic cheap boot tray. If you want a plastic cheap boot tray then this plastic cheap boot tray is right for you.
4,Looks nice for a boot tray and very affordable,Bot this for my office. It is large enough and I like the high edge which will avoid water runoff.
2,Not good!,"Quite flimsy for the price. After I ordered this, I bought one at Home Depot for $4 and it is better than this. would not recommend this given the price"
5,nice,works perfect for what i wanted it for. we are a no shoes in the house home and when people come in i wanted a place that was very clearly for shoes. does the trick.
5,Not Just For Boots,"My cat insists on digging a paw full of food out of his bowl. dumping it on the floor, and eating from there. I even got large dog bowls to try to help...no luck. This mat is perfect, keeps all the stray bits contained, and washes up easily. And, an added bonus, water bowl spills don't damage our hardwood floors. Just got a new puppy and ordered another one of these for him. Perfect for pets."
2,Passez votre chemin,"L'unique Oratorio d'Antonio méritait mieux que cette course contre la montre, et des couleurs un peu plus fines : trop pteux.... Bon, seule consolation, la version dirigée par Robert King (Hyperion) avec les somptueuses Anne Murray, Maria Cristina Liehr et Suzan Bicley : de loin la meilleure !"
4,"Does the job, but not as expected - lack of support material","It does the job, but it's not as easy as I expected it to be. I don't know if I'm using it wrong, but if I am, it's not obvious and there is a distinct lack of support material (even on the Web). It takes accurate temperatures, but I only have about half-a-second to aim with the laser before it takes the temperature - I don't really have a chance to move it around with the laser on before it takes the reading. The reading sits on the screen for 30 seconds before I can use it again. It's also supposed to help you find hot spots by scanning an area continuously, but I'll be dammed if I can get it to do that - again, the documentation leaves one wanting."
2,Paper Thin Paper Dolls,"These are pretty paper dolls with pretty dresses. For a collector that wouldn't play with the set, it would make a lovely book just to look at, however for a little child this might not be a good choice.The princesses themselves are printed on very light weight cardstock - feels thinner than a business card; The dresses are printed on flimsy, slickish paper - similar to cheap gift wrapping paper.Two of the four dolls (Aurora & Ariel) have long hair so that their are tiny little slits in their hair by the shoulders in which you'd have to insert the top tabs of the dresses. If the dresses were made from a thicker material, this might not be a problem, however for a small child it's like putting a limp noodle into a needle hole."
4,"great, but fragile","Yes, they are paper dolls, but these are printed on fairly light paper. My 5-year old has ripped every large piece she had popped out of the book. My job is to tape the rips since I am not allowed to help get them out in the first place. This is a nice book, but I'd recommend it for kids 6 years and older."
1,Ouch!,Not exactly what I was looking for. Many out of date Railroad and Military freq's. Some of these listings have been out of service for 15 years. Very little coverage of the Marine Band. I bought the book for these reasons and was very dissapointed. I could have written a better book on these bands from my own knowledge and limited resources.
4,Lynda Barry is funk queen of the galaxy,"Lynda Barry saved my life with Ernie Pook's Comeek when I lived in Washington DC, and in return I feel obligated to purchase every book she's ever written. Not that that's an awful thing. The continuing saga of Marlys and Maybonne keeps me in tears, both from laughter and from sadness. The only reason this only gets four instead of five stars is that I'm starting to get a little burned out on them. Barry is so precise in tales of growing up, she's in a league with Groening, Judge, et al, in perfectly capturing, in a crude drawing, such common elements to our childhood as cereal boxes, bad haricuts, and boys who smoke. I highly recommend any Lynda Barry collection, and this chapter does not disappoint."
2,almost impossible to read,"This book is almost impossible to read as it jumps around. Thoughts are incomplete and it follows no true timeline in order to follow the main character of the book. It gives the appearance of a poorly written defense of Lucretia Borgias' reputation. It leaves you unsure of the unbiased nature of the author.This book definitely should not be sold as a biography for Lucretia Borgia. It is about the political intrigues and blatant evil actions of her brother, Caesar and father, Pope Alexander VI. It should be sold as a commentary about corruption in the middle ages as practiced by a pope and his illegitimate son."
3,It's probably just me!,"Hard reading, I'm probably just not smart enough! (You say the review has to be twelve more words??? What more can I say?)"
4,Lucretia Borgia,I enjoyed reading about the exciting life of a pope's illegitimate daughter. There were many horrific twists and turns in her life.
2,Lucretia Borgia (illustrated),"I was really looking forward to reading about Lucretia Borgia's life. The book was written like a history book, not like a novel or a historical biography. I actually could not finish the book, I just cannot get into it. I kept trying hoping that the author was just giving you a background but no, sorry to say. It was actually very confusing with the way all of the historical references were written into the book, at least the part I could get through."
5,Love that mortiser,"I have a Delta drill press and had used a mortising attachment for several years. It is quite difficult and time consuming to set up. I had wanted a dedicated mortiser and decided to try the Jet, and boy am I pleased. Basically, right out of the box you are ready to make great mortises. I attached it to an auxilliary table as described in the manual and began work. I am building an antique pie safe and am using very hard red oak lumber. The Jet tooled through the red oak like cutting through butter. I especially like the slow speed (1750 RPM) that the drill bit turns. You are assured that you will not burn the wood. The chisels are also incredibly sharp. I found it easy to set the work fence to center the work piece and properly setting the cutting depth adjustment is a breeze. All in all, a very fine tool. Very glad I bought it!"
4,Good Product for the Price,"This is a handy little tool! It makes nice, neat mortises if you take the time to set up correctly. For straight-forward mortising, it's a snap. More challenging situations require some ingenuity and patience, but it's worth the trouble. Glad I read the reviews....mine was bent in shipping also. The motor fan housing was mashed right down on the fan blades. Just took the housing off and laid it flat on a table and carefully bent it back where it belonged. No problem. They do need to pack it more carefully."
2,Typical imported bench mortiser,"I purchased a Delta mortiser first. It's fence was all crooked. So I returned it and bought the jet. The Jet's motor sounded like the bearings were going out and the frame was considerablely flimsier than the Delta. When I attempted to make 3/8"" mortise in maple, the head of the Jet mortiser flexed about 1/8"". I'm returning the Jet, and I'm going to order the Powermatic."
5,Hard Earned Money Well Spent,"After 10 years of making mortises on a drill press it was time to upgrade. Oh, how I wish I had done this 10 years ago! I own several Jet products and have always been surprised by the level of quality I get for the cost. The JBM-5 Benchtop Mortiser is the biggest surprise to date. Easy to assemble, a breeze to operate, powerful and accurate. The bits/chisels that came with it cut like butter. A slight pull on the upstroke is nothing to write home about. When I'm in my shop now and glance over at the mortiser...a grin creeps over my face."
3,"Good machine, bad QC","I used my neighbors machine... he has this same machine, I was so impressed, I ordered it the next day.Mine arrived very quickly, amazon is great -- the packing was perfect, but the machine looked like it was assembled by monkeys!The fan and fan cover were beat up and broken and one of the screws was cross-threaded. Yeah, they are sending me new pieces, but what a bad QC job!!"
4,Quality tool for the cost,"Simply put - this is a good machine for the cost. I'm not the world's most skilled craftsman, but I found the set up and use of the Jet mortiser easy and accurate. I was able to unpack it, set it up, and drill a few test mortises within an hour.Some reviewers have commented that when you are buying a bench-top mortiser you are buying a machine with somewhat limited use. I'm not sure what kind of work that they do, but I find the capacity more than sufficient for any project that I am planning.I also found it easy to align. Right off the bad I made sure that I got a good square alignment and then drilled out a few mortises for each size bit. Whenever I set up the unit, I simply check the alignment against my pre-aligned jig."
2,Just a Toy - Save Your Money,"Sorry to say that this was the highest rated bench top unit I ever heard about, and it really was just a toy. If you really want a quality machine, stick with the large freestanding units. Hold down and fence are sloppy (typical SE Asian machine), and the unit is quite underpowered. Great leverage from the handle, and you'll need it to jump over that first defective tooth (after that, it's pretty smooth). If you have one of those drill press type mortise attachments, stick with it until you can afford or justify the big machine....skip over this intermediate step. Who uses mortises anyway ? Get yourself a good plate jointer (biscuits) instead."
5,I did my homework.,"It's a good thing I read all the reviews of both the Delta and Jet mortisers. To the guys who bought the Delta and wrote the reviews, thanks for jumping on that grenade. Not only is the Jet less expensive, it is hands down the better tool. Out of the box I was cutting holes in quarter sawn white oak for my version of a spindle bed, (37 spindles in the headboard alone!). It has the feel of a tool that will keep it's place on my benchtop for years to come. I got some good tips from the reviewers too; mounting to a 3\4"" piece of plywood, rotating 180 deg. to work on larger pieces, etc. Thanks again guys.P.S. The $5.00 S&H didn't hurt either."
4,Jet JBM-5 Benchtop Mortiser,"I recently purchased this tool and was very pleased at the ease of how it went together. I was able to make square holes only minutes after opening the box. I have other Jet equipment and for the most part have been quite pleased with their performance. The only reason I did not give this tool a 5 star rating are the chisels. I'm sure they are fine for general home use but,I feel the steel is not as good of quality as the companies that specialize in making the chisels only. I would also like to thank the craftspeople who respond to these forums so that some of us can learn by their mistakes ie. Delta ""PIECE OF JUNK"" mortiser. For the quality and price I will stick with JET."
4,Chisels need some work,"I purchased this tool to replace the drill press mortising attachment I had been using. This is so much more convenient and a bargain if you can find it on sale.The tool is great and had no defects when I unpacked it. Assembly was easy. If you pay attention during setup and use care while operating, this tool will cut perfect mortises every time. This is not a production machine but is perfect for a small shop like mine. It does require some skill on the part of the operator to ensure proper setup and use.My only complaint is that the chisels needed some clean-up work to improve their finish and some sharpening."
2,short mortiser,"This is not typical Jet equipment, I have a Jet table saw, lathe and band saw, they are impressive tools. I should have read the small print with the mortiser. the throat is just enough to mortise a 2X4, in hard wood the motor jams because of wood chips, the chuck is too small 5/8ths would have been a better choice and hard to access. I did keep the machine and added a spacer for wider stock. It does work better than my drill press but not much.Rich"
3,JBM 5 mortiser: engineering problem,"I recently purchased, a JBM 5, this is a very easy tool to set up and use, and does do accurate and quite reproducible work. There is one large problem. There is a mismatch between the chuck and the 1/2 inch chisel bit combo. Jet disclosed to me, after I could not insert the 1/2 inch bit as far into the chuck as was necessry to work with the chisel, that there is a mismatch between the bits and the chucks, and some machines got the wrong chuck for the bit. Very unfortunately, they offered me no fix, other than to cut down the drill shank enough that it would fit in the chuck and not stick out of the chisel. I found this quite suprising."
4,Jet mortice machine and their chisels,"A recent project required several hundred mortices and I decided it was time to bite the bullet and buy a dedicated morticer. The Jet was chosen based on price and the ""free"" chisels included. The free shipping from Amazon.com made them the supplier of choice.The machine arrived promptly and was easily assembled. The instuctions for operation are fine but contain no helpful hints in mortice operations, i.e., how to get a clean bottom on the mortice.The machine has performed admirably. The stops are secure, the fence easily aligned and the chisels adequate. These are not top of the line chisels but they do work. The machine is fairly quiet.Overall I'm pleased. I have not tried other brands but this machine has done the job without complaint.Good luck"
3,The jet mortiser not the best,"I have looked at several mortisers and find the jet to be a fair tool but has more side play than I would like. I own several Jet tools, Cabinet saw, Drill press, dust collector and have been quite satisfied with the overall performance of these tools. But the mortiser will not be one of the tools in my shop."
3,Jet Bench Mortiser had some quality issues,"When I received the mortiser, there were no obvious signs of damage. However, when I opened the box I found the top fan cover was dented in so as to impede the movement of the cooling fan. It was easy to pound back out and there is no paint or structural damage but it should never have left the factory that way. Also,the post that the hold down clamp secures to has a set screw to hold it tight and that was loose from the factory. There is no wrench included to tighten it and it took a while to find one in my collection that was close enough tighten it. Just a pain in the neck. Once I got going, it performed as I would have expected although I will probably get a better set of bits than the ones included."
2,At the End of the Santa Fe Trail,"Be very careful if you are reading this book for an accurate historical account. She embellished many events and dates, such as her meetings with Billy the Kid, which do not appear to be possible or truthful. For example, when she describes her dramatic first meeting in Trinidad, CO, with Billy the Kid in 1876, he was in Arizona and not a leader of a gang. A trip in a mule-drawn wagon to settlements south of Albuquerque in 1879 has an interesting speed-of-light detour through Gallup. Maybe her notes got mixed up."
5,Inspiring story and an entertaining read,"I love this book and pull it out over and over again whenever I'm looking for a good read. Don't judge the main character,Sister Blandina, by her name. She is a fascinating person with undaunting courage. Her story of travelling to the unsettled territory of the old west is inspiring. She meets up with cowboys and outlaws and ordinary folk - always willing to offer her faith and compassion to help. This is a great read about a small nun who made a big impact in her part of the world."
4,Very interesting science fiction,One of the best science fiction I have recently read. The time in which the whole story is playing is very interesting and the problems that the heroes encounter are really great!The aliens in the story are very interesting and original and I always enjoyed learning about a new race.The beginning of the book is a little slow but it rapidly increases pace and finally becomes glued to your fingers.I highly recommend it.
4,"Classic science fiction, pacey plot and strong female lead","It's no wonder that Maxine McArthur won the George Turner Award with this novel.It is well crafted, immaculately written and a great read.The plot keeps dragging you in and her well defined future space station, filled with dripping aliens, strange creatures and distant and aloof superaliens lends itself to an epic.The depth of prose excites the emotions and you can almost feel yourself going on Halley's journey and experience her isolation.The problems faced by Jocasta are compelling and the twist and turns almost make one dizzy.Great stuff and a great read."
1,Couldn't finish it,"I wanted to like this book, because the premise seemed so interesting. But after forcing myself through 100 pages or so, I finally had to give up. I found Ms. McArthur's style too disjointed to entertain or engage the imagination. She describes bulkheads and electronic consules better than she describes the action of the story. Dialogue is stilted, with everyone talking in choppy, uninformative sentence fragments. It's amazing they communicated anything at all. My interest in the mystery waned with every chapter I read, until I decided it wasn't worth the effort. Sorry."
4,A fascinating and complex tale.,"The density of ideas here is vast, with action being of secondary concern. There is an interweaving of storylines, both mystery and science fiction, which creates tension and movement through the pages. I found the constant flashbacks by Commander Halley to her relatives and their political turmoil to be interesting, but not readily relevant, and thus a bit of a distraction. Overall a really interesting book--a 'thinking man's' science fiction."
4,Surprisingly good!,"I really liked this book, which I picked up at a second hand bookstore. I think it may appeal to readers who like C. J. Cherryh's novels, as well as readers of space opera. Some interesting aliens, and some difficulty communicating in a crisis situation, with appropriate results. I looked for other novels by McArthur, and have ordered Time Future. I don't see anything recent, and am disappointed that she has not continued to write. Our loss."
2,"Tank leaked after 4 years, not worth $200+ ($300 Cdn!)","The tank has started leaking (not the fittings) after approx. 3-4 years, assume it is corroded, definitely NOT the quality you should get for such an expensive product. (and the first unit I bought was defective, the technician they sent out had to replace it)."
2,Worked good until tank broke,Bought a new house with this hot water dispenser pre-installed. After about a year the plastic nub that one of the tubes connected to for removing steam broke off the plastic tank and caused hot water to spill out over the top of tank. Not happy with the quality of unit and will look for different brand that does not use cheap plastic materials.
2,Great unit except for the cheap handle/nob,"I have ownded this item for 4 years. My parents had a similar device, though a different brand, and we fell in love with it. I bought this one hoping for the same quality, but was disappointed. While the tank and fittings have been fine, we have had trouble with the turn knob from the date of purchase. It doesn't sit tightly on the unit, spins freely without turning on the water sometime, and just has a cheap look and feel to it. Even when it does work, I just don't like the design. Since it is somewhat loose, you can't really predict which way to turn it to get the maximum water flow, and you have to play with it back and forth to finally get it going. I can't recommend this product, and would suggest you get a different brand."
5,Exactly what I wanted.,"THis is exactly what I was expecting. It works as described, I'm thrilled with this purchase. Also, arrived on time."
1,Love the product hate the quality,This is my third instant water heater. the first InSinkErator one came with the house and had a copper tank. It gave way after a few years at the seams (not sure how old it was). The second one had a plastic tank and may have lasted but it had to be replaced when I put in granite counter tops - they made the faucet threads too short to fit in granite. The third one has a stainless steel tank so I thought it would last. It failed after 2.5 years. It leaks at the gasket between the top and bottom halves of the tank (looks like there may be an o ring in there). Wow - I am not pleased. I love instant hot water and you will too - but look for another brand.
1,"Works great, until it starts leaking and you don't know about it!","Unit worked great for approx 18 years, at least we thought, then noticed that the entire cabinet was destroyed. Apparently, this unit had been leaking for a very long time, horrible rust everywhere, destroyed the cabinet and all the appliances next to it. Everything was rusted out due to this leak. Will have to replace more than this unit!!!So do beware, we are going to order another one, however, after replacing the cabinet, we are going to keep a GREAT eye on it. Hate to switch to another one at this point, as everything is already wired in for this unit and the sink is also set up for this unit. Wouldn't chose it, if I didn't have a choice. You probably have the choice! Look elsewhere!"
3,Leaks after 2 years,I have a customer who called me when their first unit started leaking. It was no longer covered by warranty so we replaced it. When the second unit started leaking it was under warranty so we called the company and a technician came out an replaced it. We that unit started leaking within 1 year I took it apart and discovered that In-Sink-erator uses a cheap piece of surgical tubing which eventually becomes gummy and fails because it is located right next to the boiling hot tank. I replaced that short section with a piece of hi-temp tubing and that took care of the problem. They are engineered to fail putting a cheap piece of tubing against the boiling hot tank. Good luck.
1,piece of junk,"We purchased one in 2006 and had it professionally installed by a plumber we often use. It's never worked that well. When it cycles to heat water, it leaks out the spigot. I turned down the heat setting and that solved some of it, but not all. And, of course, the lower temperature means that ""near boiling"" isn't even close. Now, four years after we installed it, the case is leaking and the unit needs to be replaced. Our plumber tells us that this is typical for these units, and he replaces InSinkErator instant hot water dispensers all the time. Even with a warranty, we plan to scrap it and buy something better -- anything except from this manufacturer."
1,the worst yet,"After going through five ISE heaters in ten years I went to what appears to be a far superior waste king unit. The ISE ruined cabinets, nearly started fires, popped breakers, and and all leaked like seives after little time. Dozens of notes to ISE basically said I was stupid to think a unit should last over a year or two and offered no help whatsoever. All I can say is that a once great american brand is no more"
1,Waste of money,"I have had two InSinkErator Instant Hot Water Dispensers fail in the past two years. The unit starts leaking from the bottom after about 11 months of use. The unit is poorly designed. I keep the unit at about 150 degrees, far less than the maximum setting. Inside the unit, there is a clear plastic tube about 2 to 3 inches in length that connects the tank to the dispenser tap. Over a very short period of time the plastic tubing becomes brittle from the heat and cracks, thus causing the unit to leak from the bottom of the plastic enclosure holding the stainless tank and heating element. The tubing costs less than 25 cents which causes this $200 unit to fail. The leak has caused extensive water damage underneath the sink before I detected the leak. Until the manufacturer makes a design change, these units will not be dependable. You are better off capping the hole in the sink and heating water in a microwave and save your $200."
1,A good idea gone soggy,"I have had 3 Insinkerator hot water dispensers. This last one I had lasted maybe two years. It only gets used 3-4 times a week at the most. I could dig out the warranty information and get a replacement since it has a 3 year warranty but I'm choosing not to replace it. When these break down they leak under the sink. Everything gets wet. If you have one, be sure to keep items that can be damaged by water in some sort of plastic bin or bag to prevent them from getting ruined when your unit goes out. As others have mentioned, every time I've replaced my unit in the past, the fittings have changed so it's not just a simple change of the tank that can occur. The fittings need replacing as well. It seems to me that after all of these years, they could come up with something that doesn't leak all over when it goes out. A waste of $200."
1,disappointment and disgust,The InSinkerator model number H770 Hot Water Dispenser was installed on Tuesday. It was used once. The following morning the knob broke off. The knob could not be put back on. We are awaiting a replacement faucet from the company.
4,SO useful!,"Admission here: I really can't get along without this gadget. Yes this is the third one in fifteen years but I'll just keep on buying them, paying to have them installed, using them constantly. It's not just the always available cup of tea but the quick rinse, semi-sterilizing effect on kitchenware."
5,My wife is happy...again!,Bought this one to replace one that went bad after ten years. It was an easy install...has been working fine
4,Insinkerator Hot Water Dispenser - H770-SS,"Product works fine and installed well. It replaced a similiar Insinkerator model that developed a tank leak after five years use. Only dissatisfaction was that moisture developed under the top cover in the dispenser knob. This occurred after a few days. From an appearance perspective, it is distracting, though it does not affect the operation of the system."
3,Kudos to the company!,"We love our instant hot unit and like many others who sent in reviews, ours began to leak after just 3 years. Since it was out of warranty, I opened it to see what the cause of the leak might be and found a short plastic tube that had ""worn"" out, probably due to heat. I called the company to see if I could get a new tube, but was told they don't service internal parts. They then looked up my manufacturing date by serial number and told me they would send me another entire heating unit at no charge. Bottom line: I'm happy with the solution and pleased that the company is standing behind their product, as I believe that for the price, these units should last at least 5 years. One last suggestion to the company: how about a design modification to eliminate the weak plastic tube...or...make it a replaceable part?"
1,insinkerator insta hot,"I have had two of these in the past ten years, and they both broke the same way - by leaking. This is ridiculous. Regular house hot water heaters are used far more and last for years and years - and from reading the reviews it seems that these are built to break after a short amount of time.I just got off the phone with the company and they just said I have to buy a new heater at Home Depot. That will probably cost about $300 and another $150 for labor.Very annoying. I would not buy this again."
1,You are going to get burned,"Same boat, works OK for a few years, then the inevitable burst occurrs, the flooding and the expense and frustrations of attempting to install a new unit. I'm on my 3rd. Different pipe locations, nonstop work and frustration. Fugget 'bout it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Expired before Warranty did,The quality of this product has really gone downhill. The first one I purchased lasted 10 years until it started leaking. This time the dispenser started leaking after only 2 1/2 years. It was a nice convenience while it lasted but I will go back to heating water in the microwave. The fact that InSinkErator only warranties this dispenser for 3 years should tell you something. I would not recommend purchasing this brand.
1,Water stinks from insinkerator hot water heater,"The home we bought 10 years ago had the H770ss and we loved it. In 2005 we replaced it because it leaked. Now, the water coming out of it stinks - bad. I will certainly think twice before replacing this one."
1,This brand is JUNK,I bought one new in 2002. The first tank failed after 3 years and caused a giant mess when it poured water under the sink. I bought a replacement stainless steel tank to replace it and it just failed and leaked and caused a big mess under the sink. I have leaned my lesson. I just ordered a different brand.
3,Hotwater on Tap,"This is our third Unit for our staff lunch room, I get as much as 5 years and as little as 1 year out of these units- They get lot's of Daily use, I have them in other building's as well and they get the Job done, Most of the failures is the heating element but I have had the Knob break on a unit - I know the staff is not to happy when they fail because they come to depend on the "" Instant "" Hot water"
4,Wouldn't be without one!,"This is our third InsinkErator. The last one started leaking after five years and I had to put in a new one because we use it for everything. My wife drinks a lot of instsnt coffee, we use it for hot chocolate, it's great for instant oatmeal, and we use it for macaroni, etc. as it cuts down on the cooking time. That's why we have the larger tank."
3,Liked it but wish it was more reliable,1st tank cracked and leaked after about 2 years. Second tank had different fittings and the fitting are now leaking (2 more years). New tanks have different fitting agian and I am trying to decide if it is worth replacing the tank or just getting a different brand.
2,Be prepared to replace after 2 years,"Today I look under my sink and see the water puddle. Check my receipt for water dispenser, two years old. That figures, for fifteen years I have had the insinkerator hot water dispenser. The first lasted nearly eight years before the tank leaked. The second five years before the tank leaked this one two years. They are a great idea but the price has risen dramatically(just over $100 initially) and the quality has dropped alarmingly. When the tank leaks you have to change the complete unit as the dispenser to tank fittings change so now I face spending nearly $200 for a replacement. I think I will check out other manufacturers first!"
2,Doesn't Last,"I am on my 3rd one in 7 years. The first two each lasted 2 years, and the third one just flooded my kitchen after 3 years. I would love the product, if it would actually last! While it works, it is great! But, is it worth that much money for an average 2 year life?"
1,tank cracked,"tank cracked after 3 years, service people told me I would have to buy a new one (at over 200.00 dollars) Called company, apparently they know it cracks and don't stand behind it. Never buying this brand again."
5,"Superb, simultaneously comprehensive and concise","I just returned from a wonderful stay in Morocco, and this book was most useful. One minor quibble - re the book's advice against men wearing shorts - it's quite acceptable now"
5,Another Good Ole Boy From Those Western Hills,"Every once in a while I like a little change of pace from my main folk/rock/mountain music interest. Usually, that entails getting out the old jazz classics like Duke Ellington or Benny Goodman. However, every so often it also includes getting up a little dust with old Bob Wills. His countrified swing from the hey day of that genre is a pleasant surprise taken in small doses. Remember not everyone who needed to swing in order to drive away those Great Depression and World War II blues was in the city. Wills played around with and adapted the swing idea to that rural Saturday night barn dance milieu. From ballads like ""Right or Wrong"" to stompers like ""Sugar Blues"" to the haunting ""Lone Star Rag"" you get a good beginner mix with this album. That is as far as I am willing to take you. If you need more then you are on your own."
2,different fabric,"I purchased 3 pieces from the group and I have a different type of fabric on this chair, but it is part of the group. Otherwise it is great"
3,Contact?,"I ordered this item a while ago but want a replacement seat cushion, the only one i can find doesn't look like the one that this comes with. I know this isn't the place to ask for this but for the life of me i can't find any contact info for you to email this question. Ill be placing an order for the replacement as well as a corner piece if i can get ahold of you."
5,Fitch Loves them,These are great. The cat loves them and plays for hours. It is really a great price for so many. Compared to going to Petco or some store like that.Great buy!
5,modewration,onlyu place a couple out at a time or you will be stepping all over them all the time. cats love them and bat them everwhere.
4,"Cat loved them, but watch your dog!","I got these for our young cat. He absolutely loved them, and having so many made it easy to just give him another when he inevitably batted them under the fridge or stove. He'd have hours of fun with a couple of these little mice.The bad thing about these is that they are very easy for a dog to swallow. Our 20 pound rat terrier puked one up in front of us one day and that was the end of that. We decided to give them away after that happened. So be advised! If your dog does not have as much of a predatory drive or if you can take the time to teach your dog to leave the cat toys alone, then you'll probably be okay. That said, it's still probably a good idea to supervise your dog when he or she is around these toys anyway."
3,Awesome,"We have two cats and no matter how many of these we have, they seem to disappear. What a fun colored pack at a reasonable price."
2,Had to throw them out,At first I thought this was a great deal but once I gave them to my cats it wasn't long before they started gagging. The mice are very poorly made.. eyes come right off and the 'fur' also comes off when they have it in their mouths. I would not reccomend this product.
1,Potentially dangerous cat toy,"These little mice are colorful and cute and made as a cat toy. However, in a child's hands or if picked up by a dog, they are potentially very dangerous. They are very small and covered with real fur. They are about 3/4"" in diameter, about the size of a child's or dog's throat. I'm not crazy about the fact that they are made of real fur either. I am by no means an animal rights person, but I find it senseless in this day and age to make a toy out or any kind of real fur."
1,Never got it.,"I ordered the product, received an email confirmation, was notfied of order shipment, item wasn't in the box, went back online and was told the product was discontinued. Still waiting on refund."
1,Real fur rattle mice,the fur is not real like it used to be and the glue is thick and exudes from the miceI sadly ordered 2 boxes -- a waste of moneymy cats will not even touch them-- they sniffed at walked awayI donated them to a shelter and they told me that the dye is coming off on everything including bedding and in the water bowls so they threw them away when they saw the dye on cat faces and tongues and pawsthe company says the dye is not dangerous but cannot supply the type of dye and my vet was not pleasedI wish I could find the ones that are just plain grey and white
5,Fantastic!,I have a cat and a dog who both love these mice! We go thru mice so quickly between the dog's love to chew and the cat's ability to hide these things everywhere.... This box was huge and the mice are perfect. They're the right size and my pets love the fur covering. They're also (I think) a step above the pet store mice because those are full of a pressed-cardboard material and they get nasty after landing in a water bowl or being chewed by the dog. These have a plastic body and are much less cleanup when they've reached the end of their life.Only complaint is that each mouse has a sales tag... 60 mice later I was a little sick of cutting those silly plastic tags off.
4,Great Saw,"I ordered this saw through Amazon. Assembly and instructions were pretty easy. I used a straight edge (that's used to checkengine blocks & heads) for setting the wings and they are right on. I switched it over to 220, the saw has cut everything I threw at it with like butter. Problem still unresolved, the pivot pin for the miter gauge was missing. Call Jet and since I bought it from Amazon, I have to get parts through Amazon. So far it's been over 2 weeks and still no part. Was going to order the Jet Jointer but after the fence deal I bought it from a local Woodcraft store. Other then that I'm happy with the saw."
5,Jet JWTS-10CW2-JF,"Just Purchased this saw last week. The saw arrived in two packages, all the hardware was there, the instructions were clear and easy to follow. It took about 4 hours to assemble, I had the neighbor to help with the extension wings. The instruction for assembly of the blade guard had a poor picture. I think that for the money it is a good saw. You definately need to run on 220 volt. On 115 volt it would dim the lights in the shop. Converted to 220 volt and lights do not even flicker."
4,"Really Good Costume Detail, Very Funny","I bought this for a wonderfully quirky friend & when she opened it, we went through the costumes & dressed up the flamingo. It was hilarious & the creativity of the costumes was quite extraordinary. Seasonal & Holiday themed hats, some with beards, jackets with velcro closures. So much fun, we laughed our butts off. On Thanksgiving, your flamingo turns into a turkey. It was delivered in a very timely fashion. Two complaints, the black paint on the flamingo was chipped & the elastic on the hat is too loose, we are going to use velcro. Minor issues. Also, during the rainy season, it needs to be under cover & out of range of sprinklers. It is too well done to ruin the costumes. It is a great gift & a good value. Now I want one."
4,Good quality flamingo outfits,I was pleased with the quality of the outfits. The only disappointment aws that there isn't another outfit suitable for summer.
4,More Fun Than Playing With Dolls,The flamingo is sturdy and the outfits continue to look good after several years of being outside. Totally cool!
4,Excellent primer.,"This book strictly focuses on the all-too-important ""deal-making"" with partners/investors/lenders/landlords. Excellent info here. If you are expecting a book teaching you how to operate a restaurant: 1-that is not what this book is about 2-you should be buying this book anyway if you are thinking about opening an eatery anyway."
2,not worth money or time,The movie was pretty short and half of it was the scientists talking. It is not worth the money or the time.
3,Not what I expected...,"If you are looking for something on the level of Planet Earth look elsewhere.For those of you (like myself) who have never seen ""Nature"" before: it is shot on video rather than film. This means that it looks like you shot it with your camcorder. Also, some of the content is clearly not HD, ant it can be distracting as it switches back and forth.As for the content, don't expect anything scary for the ""monsters"" part of the program.I do have to admit that parts of the disc are stunning, hence the 3 stars. But over all, I would have picked a different title if I had known what I was getting."
5,Excellent product,Works great easy to set up and now my 9 computers are all Happy!!! I am Too! My basement office is taking shape and NASA will be jealous!!!
1,"Purchased Two of these, both failed after two years..and out of warrentee.","I purchased two of these 8 port switches, and two of the 5 port switches. For some reason the two 8 ports switches have failed in two years, both with same issues, freezing and hanging. Which is temporarily fixed by cycling the power. The two 5 port switches are still working. I had all the ports in use on both of the 8 ports switches...so maybe that had something to do with it.Needless to say, I had to replace them with D-Link 8 port switches...hopefully they will last longer than these did.By-the-way, I was able to get over 70MB/s using JUMBO frames set to 9000 between my iMac and my QNAP, so for me the JUMBO frames worked fine."
4,"Great little box, but a few nits","This is a great little router and is awesome for the price, but seems to have an issue where some NICs that initially connect at 1000 Mbps will drop to 100 Mbps for no reason. Plugging the NIC in question into any other port on the switch will allow the NIC to connect at 1000 Mbps, but plugging it back into its old port will cause it to reconnect at 100 Mbps. This behavior continues until you power cycle the switch, at which point the NIC connects at 1000 Mbps again.Don't misunderstand, this isn't a big deal, just a bit of an annoyance - when you notice a port that's supposed to be green has gone yellow, it means it's time to power cycle the switch. I've had to do this, on average, about once every two months or so."
5,Flawless,"This is the second one that I get for my office (too many machines!). It worked flawlessly out of the box, just like the first."
1,Weird Problems with Windows and IP Phone,"I owned two of the version 3 models of this switch, and with both I experienced the same problem: from time to time the switch would glitch out and lose packets. Things worked pretty well when I was connecting to the internet with a computer, but I had an Aastra IP Phone that would sometimes display ""No Service"" and refuse to accept calls. I also noticed that when I'd try to open one Windows computer from another in the ""Network"" dialog it often wouldn't work the first time, but if I tried it again it would work ok.After eliminating every other cause for these glitches, I replaced one of the switches with another of the same model and the problems persisted.After eliminating that, I got a different routerTRENDnet 8-Port Unmanaged Gigabit GREENnet Standard Switch (8 x 10/100/1000Mbps)which made these annoying little problems go away."
5,amazing,I was really surprised at the difference in down load speed when I switched from my old switch to this Gig switch. It made me up date my other computer hardware.
4,Works good.,"Well built, clean. All products like this should be built this well. Looks a little like it was designed by Apple."
4,Works pretty good,This product works well; however my main complaint is that its basically impossible to find out the default admin user/pass if you don't have the documentation (which I didn't b/c I bought mine used). :(
2,AVOID THIS MODEL!,"Netgear tends to make a fairly decent product for the price, but the GS608v2 is flawed.Random ports on the switch will infrequently negotiate 1000Mbit speed and will fall back to 100 after about 3 min without a link. Other ports work just fine at 1000Mbit, but you will have to experiement to find the ones that do work. On top of that, some network devices will not negotiate at all including two 100Mbit laptop network cards, one 3com and one xircom which are very solid, reliable devices in any other situation, but do not work with this switch.Other users complain of overheating issues or freezing issues that require a power cycle, or even complete failure after about a month, but I have only had mine a few days so those problems havent come up yet.Go with any other 8 port gigabit model. This one is not worth the hassle. I can only hope netgear will allow me to RMA this item for some other model."
2,Failed after 3 years,"I bought this in April of 2009, at the time I was happy with the performance. I haven't been regularly monitoring its performance. Nov of 2011 I noticed that a wireless access point connected to this switch was having performance issue, but I chalked it to the wireless switch. This unit itself, after a power cycle, seemed OK.But now, Aug of 2012, I noticed that a PC connected to this unit was having network speed issues, it was only getting 1MB/s from my NAS. While another PC connected to a different switch on the same network was getting 40MB/s from the same NAS. This unit feels really hot to the hand. I wonder if this is the same over-heating issue that others have mentioned.I guess 3 years is not bad, but given that it started going bad probably last Nov, after 2.5 years, and all my other network equipment, including router, wireless bridge/access point, and a 5 port desktop switch, all 10/100/1000, are all working flawlessly, this seems a little disappointing."
5,The wedding,Another great romance by SparksGreat love storyI would recommend to as allSpArks stays true to his easy reading
5,Favorite Nicholas Sparks book so far!,I am a big Nicholas Sparks fan and just finished reading The Notebook (never seen the movie) and figured reading The Wedding would be the next logical step. This book was AMAZING!!! I cried like a baby at the ending (while my boyfriend laughed at me) and just could not believe the wonderful ending. To be honest I liked this book far more than The Notebook! Wonderful wonderful book and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great love story!
2,Will probably disappoint Sparks' fans,"I have read all of Nicholas Sparks' books and this one by far is my least favorite. It's easy reading but I found it to be pretty boring, but somehow finished it because I was hoping it would get better. It by far has no comparison to The Notebook even though he has related the two. I'm not sure why this book has an average of 4 Stars. The only thing I can figure is the people rating it have not read his other books and have nothing to really compare it to. It's not AWFUL, but I can't say I'd really recommend it either. I think it will really disappoint Sparks' favorite fans.Christy (age 27)Orlando, Florida"
2,Save yourself some time,"I would say that N. Sparks is my favorite author, but this book has made me begin to wonder why. I read the Notebook in two days. I just could not get into the ""The Wedding"" story (there really wasn't one). Maybe I am just at the wrong place in my life, but reading about 2 empty-nesters going grocery shopping, making phone calls, and running errands is just not that interesting. The story finally got started in the final 4 pages. Maybe I have read too many of his books, but I have always found him to have a true talent in holding back just enough information so that you never really know what is going to happen. I knew the ending of this book before I was halfway through. I would not recommend this book unless you happen to be an empty-nester with some time to waste. (Sorry if this is too cruel.)"
3,The wedding,Couldn't finish the book but the pages I read were interesting. Some what less romantic than usual but still a good book.
2,Predictable,Almost from the beginning the end was predictable. I found the story to be sweet but there was no intrigue.
4,The Wedding,I thoroughly enjoyed The Wedding and would recommend it for reading. I have enjoyed everything I've read written by Nicholas Sparks.
2,Sappy,This book is sappy. If you want to read a book about a distant husband that has not been an affectionate mate for most of his married life and one day is transformed into Mr. Romantic this book is for you.
2,Before I buy!,"I want this book, but I am so hesitant to get it. I LOVED The Notebook. Loved it! But this sequel is not about Allie and Noah's life (from where it left off in The Notebook). I want to know about Allie and Noah's life from the time she chose him to them winding up in the senior home. I feel like Nicolas has left a huge gap; us knowing them from the start of their relationship and the end of it, all in the same movie! What happened in between? Their wedding, the births of their children, etc. They had such an intense relationship, I just want to know their lives together. This was too much a generation jump for me to be a sequel."
1,A Waste of Time,"The Notebook was a wonderfully romantic book, but this - The Wedding - is uninvolving and repetitive. This is supposed to be a contiunation of The Notebook and follows the story of Jane and Wilson; Jane is the daughter of Noah and Allie from The Notebook. Wilson and Jane have drifted apart from one another during the course of thier 30 year marriage, and this is Wilson's story of how he gains redemption for his misdeeds all those years. The characters are flat, the dialogue is repetitive, and I felt like I was reading the same chapter from beginning to end. Every chapter is almost identical to the one before it (in terms of words and descriptions), and I found this book to be boring and badly written. There is no depth here, and the writing is as if someone is speaking to you all the time. For instance, ""I got up. I went out. I went to the store. I felt happy. Then I did this..."" It is pretty childish writing and a very flat story."
2,NOT HIS BEST BOOK,I HAVE READ ALL OF NICHOLAS SPARKS' BOOKS. I USUALLY READ HIS BOOKS IN ONE DAY BECAUSE I CAN'T PUT THEM DOWN. THIS ONE IS ANOTHER STORY. I HAVE BEEN READING IT SLOWLY FOR A WEEK AND CAN'T GET INTO IT. VERY DISAPPOINTED.
2,Lost Magic,"This book is dull, I am not sure how else to put it. If you want to know every detail involved in planning a wedding then by all means read it. But if you are reading it hoping for the Magic of Allie and Noah, forget it! I suggest you read The Notebook again or Shade of the Maple by Kirk Martin, those books have the Magic we are all looking for."
3,Every Woman's Dream,"Every woman dreams of a story such as this for their own lives. Overall, I found the story to be very realistic when it came to how husband and wife drift apart after thirty years of marriage, from taking each other for granted. On the other hand, the story was unrealistic when it came to Wilson's actions in attempt to become more romantic and right his wrongs as a husband. Wilson's character seemed somewhat flat for 3/4's of the novel, but in the end his emotion and love shined through.If you are in need of a sweet love story, you will enjoy this read by Nicholas Sparks."
5,The Wedding,It is a very well written book with a great story line. I would recomend this book to anyone who likes heart warming romance novels.
4,Great book!,I couldn't put it down and I hope it turns into a movie someday! Thanks for the great read. I will recommend it.
4,Review for IE,"The Wedding by Nicholas Sparks overall was a great book. It was a heartfelt love story told by flashbacks and the main character Wilson who thinks his wife is falling out of love with him after nearly 30 years of marriage. It was sometimes boring, but at other times very discriptive and keeping you on the edge of your seat eager to turn the next page. ""With her veil in place, Jane seemed like a lovely young bride. With a bouquet of tulips, and minnature roses clasped loosly in her hands, she semmed to glide down the aisle."" I would highly reccomend this book to people who have read The Notebook which is also by Nicholas Sparks or to people who enjoy love stories. ""Sweet but packs a punch....there is a twist that pulls the whole story together and makes you glad you read this"" -Charlotte Observer."
4,Sweet,"Almost any Sparks books I have read leave me crying at some point. The Wedding was not one of them. While I could not relate to the relationship, mainly because I've only been married 11 years and don't have 30 years under my belt, I appreciated where the course of their time had taken them. I thought it was a lovely story about realizing what's in front of you and not taking another day for granted."
3,Typical Nicolas Sparks Story,"The Wedding is a typical Nicolas Sparks story, I did enjoy reading it however, I probably wouldn't read it again or necessarily recommend it to others enthusiastically and those two criteria are the way i determine whether or not the book rates 5 stars. I do feel the story will make for a good book group discussion and wish there had been some discussion questions included ."
4,Great book for entertainment,"Let's face it, we want to be entertained! This is no literary prize winner, but it is a fun book and it is easy to read. I thought the characters believable and the situation believable. My children are grown and I can see where some of these feelings come from. Maybe it was a little slow in parts, but the ending was worth it. I am tired of all the stories that end tragically or just end..... Bravo Mr. Sparks. Continue on....."
5,I couldn't put it down!!,"I made a New Year's resolution to do more reading (I'm a stay at home mom with 2 kids and little ""intellectual stimulation"") and the librarian recommeded this book. I was immediately sucked in and I loved every chapter. It is an easy read which was helpful since I only had a few minutes here and there to read it. I couldn't put it down. It was my first Nicholas Sparks book and I can't wait to read the Notebook next. I agree it would make a great Valentine's present from any guy out there looking to impress his wife. I thought it was fantastic !"
4,"Yet, another excellent read from Sparks!!","The Wedding was a great read! It pulled me in from the beginning. Nicholas Sparks love stories are always so pure and this one is no exception. A good reminder how to treat that special someone in your life, not to take for granted the love you feel for them but to show them and tell them daily. It's not too late to make up for it if you have....Very Romantic!!"
1,Wonder where this one will end up in the NY Times...,"The book is an excellent example of what happens when a writer starts with a concept that he thinks is beautiful -- falling back in love in one's fifties in this case, and stretches it into a novel. The characters, the dialogues, and the plot, all are one-dimensional and unconvincing. The cover made me buy the book, and that's about the only thing attractive to it."
4,The Wedding,Both my wife and I thought the book was very good reading and we thoroughly enjoyed it. Easy reading and fun.
2,"So Predictable, Almost Laughable... (just being honest!)","I've only read one other Nicholas Sparks book, The Rescue, which was much better than The Wedding. The beginning of The Wedding was especially depressing (I'm a newlywed so maybe I don't want to know that marriage can become THIS dull/unromantic?) and the middle was very unrealistic and almost laughable (planning a wedding at the last-minute and having everything run so smoothly?! yeah right!). I haven't gotten to the end (YET) but I'm not holding my breath for any huge surprises. But it's good to know it gets lighthearteded/humorous at the end. I gave the writing style/ease of reading a few stars for good measure, but I really think this was a shallow read. For unpredictable page-turners with DEPTH (the type of book I prefer), I highly recommend anything by Diane Chamberlain. She's soooo much better!!"
3,"Just ok, typical Sparks","I didn't see a big problem with these two people and their marriage. So he worked alot, forgot an anniversary, she did all the work, raised the kids. That's typical. Wilson didn't seem too much of a jerk to me. I just couldn't find a big issue with the relationship. Some more history with that might've helped. I also took longer to read this one that other Sparks books. Had a hard time keeping interested. The chapter ends didn't have me rushing ahead."
3,It was a good reading,"I wasnt very impressed by the story perhaps because I m not really into romantic novels,the plot was somewhat ""flat"" at the beginning however, i believe it was meant to be very simple,about a ordinary mid age couple and their eternal love..I enjoyed the writing style of the author and rich descriptive parts.The end is of this book was surprising .Nice read ."
2,Not my favorite,"The Wedding is about a man trying to save his marriage. I bought it after seeing The Notebook, which I loved. The book is supposed to be a sequel to The Notebook, but only mentions the original characters. It is about Noah's daughter, or more Noah's daughter's husband. The story line is predictable, and though it was sweet at times, it just was not my favorite. It was, however, easy to read, and I got through it rather quickly. I would not really recommend this book, but if you really like romance novels you might want to try it."
2,snoozer,"This book would be good if you have never read a book by Nicholas Sparks. It was, however, a major snoozer, and you could predict what would happen from the first chapter. All his books are starting to sound the same. I do not recommend it."
3,Predictable,I don't know if I didn't care for this book because I'm unromantic or whether I just think it was so predictably lame. Maybe I might have enjoyed it if I was 15 years younger.
4,Relaxing,I found the book incredibly enjoyable. Every book I have read by Nicholas Sparks has warranted a positive review.He is a wonderful writer who makes fantasy come true.Reading a book is comparable to a day in the park. You enjoy the time away and wish that it would never end.It also gives you the time to wonder how much of real life is interwoven with fiction.
2,Too detailed,Too much describing furniture and surroundings. I was disappointed with the going back and forth to all the children of Noah & Ally.
4,The wedding,This story is a beautiful love story. I enjoyed reading about love even after 30 years of marriage. I did find this story a little in the boring side so that is why I gave it 4 stars but I still love Nicholas sparks and his stories.
4,Pleasant Surprise,"I must admit that I'm not an avid reader and I've never heard of Nicholas Sparks before. I needed something to read while on my honeymoon (smile) and I saw this book on the shelf. I thought it was rather fitting so I decided to purchase it. Unfortunately, I didn't get to read much of it in Jamaica. But, once I started it later that month I made it a point to find the time to read it. Then, I saw the The Notebook on TV and I was even more anxious to read The Wedding. I absolutely loved it! It truly brought a smile to my face with every turn of the page. I would recommend it to anyone that is looking for a little romance. Well done!"
2,Expecting Better,"I read The Wedding thinking it would be like every other Nicholas Sparks book--amazing--but it wasn't even close to that. Being the sequel to The Notebook, I figured it would be more about Noah and Allie's kids growing up or something like that. Yes, it was about their kids growing up, but one of their daughters and she was in her 50s with kids already. And it was mainly about her husband. It was good at some parts, but just not that great. Just a regular book."
5,A great sequel!,"For those who have read The Notebook, this book allows you to return briefly to the romantic story of Noah and Allie. Though The Wedding is not nearly as captivating as its predecessor, it is a great summer read with an amazing ending. Enjoy!"
4,Very Good Read,"I had heard that Nicholas Sparks was a rambler, and that his stories were too long, but this book must have been the exception. The whole story was great from beginning to end, and Wilson and Jane made the story even better as they were so normal. I loved the fact that though the book seemed predictable, it throws you for a loop somewhere near the end. I also loved all the things Wilson did to make his wife realize that he still loved her and that their life together was all worth it. Everyone should make a place for this book on their bookshelf."
3,"""The Wedding"" is On","A nice, easy read, another pleasant love story. Sparks is soppy at times, but that did not dampen my interest. I particularly liked the ending--never saw it coming. And I'm a sucker for surprises. There were a few loose ends that weren't explored; but all in all, a great book for a day at the beach or in front of a fire. A feel-good story to enhance a mood of romance, hope, family, and the miracle of transformation through personal choices."
5,BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ,"The only way to describe this book - is absolutely the best authorship and storytelling ever. The book has two endings that run parallel to one another, that you never see coming. Masterfully written!!! I cried - it was one of the most beautiful love stories every written."
3,An Okay Read,"It took me a while to get through this one, I'm not sure why. I would get disinterested in a particular passage, put it down, and find it hard to pick it back up. I finally forced myself to read it, and I would say it was okay.I did enjoy the ending very much, it just took a long time to get there. I knew early on what the twist was going to be, so I wasn't surprised, but I enjoyed the experience of surprise through the characters. The most enjoyable thing about this book was that everyone lives, no one dies at the end and there's no tragedy to cry through. That in itself gained this book an extra star. All in all a good read."
4,awww,"It was a sweet tale of romance. I liked it, it was easy to read, I didn't think it was TOO predictable. It also told a sweet story."
5,The Stuff Dreams Were Made Of. . .,"Beneath the steel clad facade of our everyday-independent woman, there lies a young girl who still dreams of fairytale romances. Nicholas Sparks taps effortlessly into this part of our psyche with another heart-warming story of love. In this novel, we see the convergence of two big events: a wedding and a wedding anniversary. An effortless read and enjoyable enough to complete in one sitting, Sparks highlights the trials and tribulations of a marriage long given up on in place of careers and children, and a husband's heart-wrenching efforts to win his wife's affections back."
5,The Wedding,Very well written book kept you in suspense until end. Always a pleasure to read a good flowing storyline with wonderful surprise ending.
2,Not his best by far.,I am reviewing this book because if this would have been the first Nicolas Sparks book that I had read I probably would not have read any other ones. NS is a wonderful writer and I have enjoyed so many of his books but this one did nothing for me and I would not recommend it to anyone.
5,Excellent book!,This is my favorite book ever! I've read and/or listened to it many times! I would highly recommend it. It does not follow the normal plot line of a Nicholas Sparks Book. It's one story all couples married over ten or more years should read! Very happy story!
4,I didn't know what to expect...,"but my expectations were surpassed. This was my first Nicholas Sparks' book and I loved everything about it. It started slow at first, but once I got to know Wilson, Jane, Noah and the family everything came together. Seeing marriage, especially a long marriage, through the eyes of a man who worked too much and loved too little was a different, but interesting ride. This book was short in length, but long on story and deep in everyway. There's nothing like good old fashioned storytelling about real and wonderful people. I'm saving a star for my next Sparks read."
4,Ahh,"Such a romantic love story, written at a different view, so beautifully again. The book was harder for me to get into, being a young reader, but I love how the words just flow together into this novel. I really did enjoy it, and I suggest any Sparks fan to read it."
1,weak writing,"I do not understand how one becomes a bestselling author writing rubbish like this.My complaints are not so much about the story itself as they are about the prose. There is nothing fresh about this book. The prose is cliche, predictable and lacks depth. Therefore, if you are cliche, predictable and lack depth, you will probably love this book.There are so many amazing writers out there, I do not recommend this one."
1,Over the top sappiness,Wilson is a boring man who has spent his life letting his wife do everything else while he makes the money. The big surprise is that suddenly he realizes that he needs to make her happy so he starts cooking veal and reading poetry. He also starts walking and miraculously loses all his extra weight. It is all just so easy! The author is obviously trying to sell books to bored housewives with stale husbands. I finished the book because I was on vacation and didn't have another one to pick up.
1,One of the worst books that I have ever read,"I read this book because I had seen the movie based on ""The Notebook"" and loved it. The movie made me cry and made me laugh. It was a wonderful love story.""The Wedding"" is awful. The characters are all stereotypes -- no real people here, folks, just almost-perfect people with a few flaws. There is no plot. There is no tension in the story. The outcome is predictable and known for most of the book. (Will the wife fall back in love with the husband? Since she starts to almost immediately, it's pretty clear). The message seems to be that a man must go to outrageous lengths in order to please a woman, and if he doesn't, he is simply a failure as a husband. I'm a woman, and even I don't buy this.The only reason I finished the book was that it was an easy read, and I kept thinking that there would be more -- that there would be an interesting plot twist. Alas, there was not. (There was a ""plot twist,"" but it was neither very surprising nor very interesting)."
3,Beware of edition - This is not standard size book or quality print,"First let me say I love Nicholas Sparks, all of his books and particularly The Wedding. I ordered this book from Amazon to replace my first edition which I had loaned out and never had returned. The edition I received from Amazon was akin to a hardcover paperback. Smaller than the original, no dust jacket, and a blurry cover. WTH?!? Shame on Amazon for not listing this book correctly."
2,wouldn't recommend,"This was one of my least favorite Sparks books so far. Although touching in many ways, I thought it lacked a certain spark (so to speak)."
2,Beats you over the head,I can't see what the big deal is with Nicholas Sparks. The book was ok but nothing that I would really recommend to my friends. The writing is very simple and he beats a point to death.
4,great book,This was a great read. It was delivered in decent time and in good shape. I was impressed by the service so I will be ordering from here again.
3,Far stretch from The Notebook,"The first Nicholas Sparks book I ever read was The Notebook. Although I wasn't entirely impressed with the book, I couldn't wait to see the movie, which I absolutely loved.Because I've become somewhat obsessed with the story of the Notebook, I decided to try out The Wedding, because it was supposed to be a ""sequel"" of The Notebook. I was a little disappointed with what I read in The Wedding and figured the ""big surprise"" out within the first couple of chapters. With that being said, I think Nicholas Sparks should take a few cues from the script writers and directors that worked on The Notebook (the movie) to add more drama, detail and depth to his love stories.Overall I thought The Wedding was a pretty good book, and I wouls recommend it to a friend."
2,way too sappy,"I've really tried to get into this author's writing but again in the Wedding, I find his stuff is just way too sappy and predictable! His characters are ""made for TV"" and his plot line leaves little speculation as to how the story will end. We wrote stuff like this in Creative Writing 101! If you want something mindless for the plane or the subway ride to work, then I recommend this book...."
3,Not His Best,I've been a fan of Nicholas Sparks for many years. This is not one of his best. The plot was just so-so and the characters uninteresting.
2,Almost but not quite,"If you already read ""The Notebook"" this story will might be fairly good but it isn't quite the same story. I may be wrong but I had to compare both stories and this one isn't at par with the prequel. So for me this story is kind of long-winded and boring. By the way, and maybe this is why I didn't like this plot but I learned- maybe the hard way- to talk every problem with may wife since almost 25 years."
2,"Sweet, but dull","This story was only slightly entertaining. It was nice to read about familiar characters, but it has the feel of a silly, cheesy soap opera. It's not very well written, either. Very predictable. I felt like I was reading an outline to a movie script."
3,Book review,I just did not think it held my interest as much as Sparks usually does.I had to work to finish it and it isn't that long.
2,Terrible,"This review is for people who have never read N. Sparks before. Beware, he writes books of the same quality that Kinkade paints pictures. If you like the stuff, go ahead. His books have the feel of a product after exentsive market research into what a women of the age group 35 and up, married and with some income would like to read. It is soppy, overly sweet, with little understanding what a longterm relationship is really all about (the author cannot be older than 35 himself). This is what I expect to read in a romance novel that is devoid of sexual references. Save your money and time."
2,Wait for the movie,"The book has an interesting plot devise, but I found it rather predictable. It really only contained enough material for a short story and probably would have had more of an impact if it was written as one. I can imagine that this is the type of book that will be better as a movie. I'd suggest waiting. The end of the book didn't surprise me at all, but in a movie form with adequate directing maybe it would be less predictable. If you wait for the movie you might be pleasantly surprised.To be fair I did laugh my head off at the story of his proposal."
4,Dragged but loved the twist at the end,"The Notebook was my favorite Nicholas Sparks book (but now it just may be The Last Song), so I was excited to read the next installment.The Wedding was pretty much depressing until you get to the twist. I felt sooo bad for Wilson. You just want to scream at his wife, ""Come on, Lady! Can't you throw the poor dog a bone?""It was definitely well worth the wait for the twist. Maybe I'm just slow, but I really didn't see it coming."
4,Excellent Story,"After reading ""The Notebook"" my hopes for its sequel weren't very high. I was pleasantly surprised to find this story better than its prequel. In my opinion, Nicholas seemed to correct his mistakes with ""The Notebook"" by focusing more on the character development as well as the background story of Winston and Jane. It helped the reader to relate more to what was happening in the story and its characters.One of my favorite things about this book was its ending. I was not expecting what was coming and I absolutely love when an author catches me off guard!I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys Nicholas Sparks!"
5,Just read it!!!!,I couldn't put this book down. It was so romantic and LOVELY!! I can't praise it enough. It was one of the best stories...Must read!!
5,The Wedding,"What a wonderful continuation of the story and characters we came to love in The Notebook. You feel the love Noah carries for his sweet Allie, even though she is now gone. His attachment to a swan that he is convinced carries her spirit is heartwarming. Watching his children endure emotional hardship, and come out the other side stronger in their relationships is a lesson for all."
3,Not as good as the others...,"It starts off slow. I bought this book thinking it would be more about Allie & Noah and it wasn't, which was a let down. But overall the book isn't bad...cute story."
4,"If you are struggling with connecting with your wife, read this book!","This is not just a book that is going to make a great chick flick. If you are struggling to understand why you are not connecting with your wife after years of marriage, read this book. This is a great book for opening the eyes of us men. Great story and a great ending."
3,I could have skipped The Wedding,"After reading The Notebook, I so looked forward to reading this book. But I was disappointed. I thought it was average, and nothing like The Notebook."
3,I was really bored most of the way through this one.,"It was a bit hard for me to get through the entire book. Being a huge fan of the Notebook, I was glad to read about the continuation of Noah and Allie's life.I will say that the ending was really great. I am very glad I resisted my urge to put the book down because the ending really paid off for me!"
4,A Great Book,"I purchased this book when it first came out at a Nicholas Sparks signing. He was an amazing man and spent about 10 minutes talking to me about The Notebook movie and his memoir which I guess has just been releasd.The Wedding isn't a great book, but it is a good book. It takes a while to get going, but stick with it because it gets better. The book tells about Noah's (from The Notebook) daughter and her husband Wilson. They have been married for a while and get stuck in a rut. Wilson senses his wife is falling out of love with him and he goes to drastic measures to make her fall in love with him all over again. The ending will suprise you and leave you in tears. The Wedding is not a masterpiece like The Notebook, but if you like romance it's worth reading."
4,Worth your time,Great love story with a twist at the end. Well worth your time. Sparks did it again as usual. Can't wait to read another.
4,Good continuation of a classic love story,A good beginning that brings back the memories of the love between Allie & Noah in the Notebook. Definitely had me fooled at the end though! Great read!
5,great,great storyit was even better than i expectedtoo many words required for this reviewtoo many too many
4,Sweet. Maybe a little toooo sweet,"Allie and Noah had a daughter, Jane, who is married to an attorney. Allie has died, but Noah spends an inordinate amount of time thinking she's been reincarnated as a swami, with whom Noah - understandably - has a relationship. Noah's son-in-law, believing the spark has gone from his marriage, improbably seeks Noah's advice on how to woo Jane back. Designed to tug at readers' heartstrings, The Wedding had a touch too much syrup for my taste."
2,Very Disappointed,"I have been a fan on Nicholas Sparks for about 5 years now. I buy everyone of his books as soon as they come out. I am afraid to say that is going to change now...this book was a huge disappointment. I must say that the last three have disappointed me. Bend in the Road was the first to let me down, Nights in Rodanthe continued the downward trend and The Wedding was the final straw. This was the story of an average marriage; a man and a woman growing apart over time. In my opinion using the characters from The Notebook was a cheap ploy to pull in readers. These characters were average and pulling Noah and Allie into was unnecessary. Those two should have been left alone. If you are looking for the magic of Noah and Allie skip this book and read The Notebook again. I also suggest trying a new author, Kirk Martin and read Shade of the Maple, the love story is ever bit as moving as The Notebook."
2,dissapointment,"On receiving this CD audio for the wedding I found that the first CS to the set is missing It was stated that this CD audio was in good to excellent condition BUT how can that be it is an incomplete set, I hesitate to buy anything used again for fear of something like this happening."
5,Can't put down,I love Nicholas Sparks! I haven't read a book by him that I could put down! I recommend ALL of them.
2,The Wedding,"This was like an old paperback romance: something to read when you have nothing else at hand. I found it too syrupy sweet, even maudlin. The husband telling the story was not believable - affected, self-denigrating. I expected better from the author."
5,Great Author - Great Book.,I love all Nicholas Sparks books. I am not quite finished with the book yet - if I didn't have to put it down because of my busy schedule I would never stop reading it.
3,The Wedding by Nicholas Sparks,"A love story but not real exciting, but good fast reading where you actually can predict the ending.Younger gals would like it,I think."
2,the wedding,The book was very well written. The book was not my favorite book to read and the had a good story line.
3,Good Book,"I read this book because I love Nicholas Sparks, its was a little predictable. Still good book and would read again."
1,"Yeah, right!","First of all, men like this don't exist, which is probably why I thought of it as so sickening.Next, to the review. Wilson and Jane are a middle-aged couple having some marital troubles. He forgets their anniversary, so the next year, he plans some freakishly odd gift where he leaves notes and little presents around the house all leading up to them meeting at her parents old house for a dinner date. Then we have to read through a page and a half of them having sex in what was once Jane's parents' room. Am I crazy, or do we all feel sick when we read something like, ""Down to the floor went her new dress and my jacket."" (Yup, I thought so.)So, unless you like reading about what goes on in a 40 year old bedroom (yes, everyone does it, and I enjoy reading romances, but Sparks makes all of his sex scenes graphic.)This is all I shall leave you with my friends. Take it or leave it!"
1,Such a disappointment,"It took me months to read this book because I couldn't get into it! After reading The Notebook, what a let down! Didn't Noah and Ali die at the end of The Notebook? Not in this ""sequel"". Ali is gone, but Noah made the sequel. Overall, I was just not intrigued with this predictable book. I guess Nicholas Sparks had beginners luck with The Notebook."
2,Caution,"No reinforced stitching and very small thread at that. The bag itself is average except for the scrapes and damage all over the leather however. After a few times being snug down on the sissy bar the seams and stitching begin to pull apart. If I had to do it again I would not buy this bag. ALSO, THERE IS NO PACKING SLIP OR INVOICE so I guess once you buy it you're on your own. Jafrum is off my list."
5,"I say Yay, Yay!!","John Pinette is truly the funniest man alive! Do not watch this if you need to use the rest room or have food or drink in your mouth! Either would be a recipie for disaster. This is a DVD that everyone can watch and enjoy, from your 10 year old to your Grandmother. He does not do ""blue"" humor, so I don't even think your preacher or Rabbi would be offended. If I could rate this 6 stars I would."
3,I say its the same,I purchased this DVD along with I'm Starvin DVD. They have the same footage on both just filmed at different locations. I enjoyed them but was expecting to see and hear different comedy from each DVD. Maybe before someone purchases a DVD they could get a glimpse of what is on the DVD before actually buying it.
3,"IF YOU BOUGHT ""I'M STARVING"" - THIS ACT IS EXACTLY THE SAME!","BE VERY CAREFUL - I LOVED JOHN PINETTE IN "" I'M STARVING "", I ALSO PURCHASED "" I SAY NAY NAY "". IT IS THE SAME EXACT SHOW BUT SHOT IN DIFFERENT LOCATIONS. THE JOKES ARE EXACTLY THE SAME AND SO ARE MANY OF THE GESTURES. HE SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF HIMSELF FOR DUPING HIS PUBLIC!"
3,Pass on this one,"This man is funny, there is no doubt about it. I love him. However, after just purchasing this DVD and his ""I'm Starving"" DVD, I feel like I've been taken. If you purchase any of his DVD's, purchase ""I'm Starving."" You will get over an hour full of great side splitting laughs and it has almost the exact same content of ""I Say Nay Nay"" plus the material on ""I""m Starving."" It's like John came back from Broadway and refined his act and made it better. Had I known that ""I'm Starving"" contained the same content as the other, I would only have purchased it."
4,"I say nay nay if you buy, ""I'm Starving""",I say Nay Nay and I'm Starving have too much of the same bits. If you buy one you don't need the other. However alone either one is great.
2,I say Nay Nay,"i purchased John Pinette, I say Nay Nay and I'm Starvin. I was really disappointed that they were so identical in material just several years apart by looking at John. I thought i was buying 2 different shows. Wish your info included an idea of year was recorded and content summary.really feel wasted money buying both videos. Should have just bought one"
3,Nice Early material,"This is a good DVD for Pinette's Routine. He's quite funny in it - but it feels as though nearly all of his routine is a little rushed and quick fire.He's still very funny in it though - but I would recommend his later DVD ""I'm Starvin"" more. Get this if you would like to see how much he has developed over the years and you're a Die Hard Fan."
2,"Great performer, poor DVD quality","This is our second purchase of John's DVD from Amazon. We had to return the first one because the DVD would skip/hang in the middle of the performance. We tried it on several DVD players with the same result. Unfortunately, the replacement we received is doing the same thing. Amazon notified us that we can only get a refund, not a replacement, as this seems to be a reocurring issue.John Pinette is fantastic, loved everything about his bit....just could not see all of it due to the DVD quality."
1,Buy I'm Starving instead!!,"It's exactly the same as ""I'm starving"" only older so the jokes arent as refined. ONE joke is different in each. ONE!! I gave this away to a friend as it was great on its own. But it's great like steak is great. Then theres the filet minon - aka ""I'm starving"""
2,john pinette dvd,"The Dvd looks to be in great condition, but trying to watch it is a whole other thing. About 30- 40 minutes into it, it starts to skip. I haven't been able to watch it all the way through because of this problem. I thought maybe it was my player, but other dvds work in my player just fine. This one for some reason skips."
1,Love John Pinete ...... hated quality of DVD,First one came and stopped playing during 1/3 of the trackshad second one sent and it to skipped and stopped in certain spots. Really loved the movie still unable to play the whole dvd.Happy to send both back to get one that plays whole DVD
3,John Pinete at his best,THis is a very good dvd of John's early preformance. This is not his best material but still very funny.
2,"Good show, Poor disc","I know a few people may have already commented about this, but, the disc of this DVD is not in good condition. I purchased this new originally, defective disc. Returned and purchased a used DVD, another faulty disc. Eventually, I figured that I could rent from netflix and manage to get to see the entire disc after spending about 30$ to see the entire disc. A very poor job by whoever pressed this disc.OTHER THAN THAT!It is a really good show of John's. Not anywhere as funny as the SHOW ME THE BUFFET cd, but still very good. And look, he has a new DVD coming out soon!!!! I pre-ordered mine already, you should too, this guy is a ""will make ya pee your pants"" funny kind of guy."
1,awfu l video,This DVD was horrible!! it looked like someone taped it from a BAD cable TV program. The sound was muffled and the picture kept disappearing. I couldn't return it because Amazon won't let you return tapes and such if you open them.
2,Very Funny But......,"John is one of our favorite comedians, but this DVD was almost an exact replica of ""I'm Starvin."" ""I Say Nay Nay"" was produced first, but ""I'm Starving"" is a much better performance. We thought they would be different routines, but they were pretty much the same jokes. Don't get me wrong, John Pinette is hilarious, but if I knew they were so similiar I would have only purchased ""I'm Starvin."""
3,"Not for young ears, other DVD by him is better!!",We purchased this DVD after we purchased his most recent -I'm Starvin'- DVD. If you already have -I'm Starvin'- don't waste your money. Mr. Pinette's presentation of the jokes in -I'm Starvin'- are much better and there is more material in it. There is more cursing in -I say Nay Nay-. He is a very funny comic and worth the money to own one of his DVD's but I'd purchase -I'm Starvin'- instead of -I Say Nay Nay-.
4,Outcast - Family (import),"This CD is pretty good if you are into rap, this band also sings some other populare songs if you don't know the band (Mrs. Jackson, Everybody Move To The Back Of The Bus, Bombs over bagdad)This album has a little hiphop beat to it so thats why i like it, but i sugest that you buy there new album (sanoka) but this is good too."
4,Flickscribble Plus,"A very good read to clear out those cobwebs induced by your almost futile attempts to complete Gibbon's ""Decline and Fall"". Have you noticed how many ""novels"" today are really just screenplays without the stage directions? I believe the term in Hollywood is a ""treatment"". They're really storylines looking for producers, so they don't have to be real novels. Only in our fast paced, dizzyingly visual, special effects laden culture could this work be called a novel.I mean if the movie ""Bullet"" were shot today, all of it would be edited to look like the chase scene it's so justly famous for. (Ah, the curse of those early music videos!)So I hereby designate this genre, affectionately, ""Flickscribble"". And this book is a much better evocation of the genre than most and justifies the four stars above. Just don't call it a ""novel""."
2,Dull,"I bought this album based on the first, glowing review. But despite listening to it at least 5 times, I can not recommend it. The album begins promisingly enough, but around the 6th madrigal a depressing sameness sets in."
4,El Latigo,"As it says on my list, this was the final Republic Zorro serial, even though the character Zorro is not even in the story. A gang of crooks led by a saloon owner (Mauritz Hugo) attempts to rob an Indian reservation of it's gold. A local settler (Richard Simmons) and a school teacher (Barbara Bestar) attempt to stop the gang. To win the trust of the local Indians, the settler takes on the guise of El Latigo, a legenary Indian friend. This film had stock footage from many films, including Zorro's Black Whip, featuring Linda Stirling."
2,Too Tired to Cliff-Hang!,"The stock footage hits the fan in this cost-cutting Republic serial. One of the last studio chapterplays, ""Man with the Steel Whip"" (1954) should have been called ""Recycled Zorro."" A good cast does its best amid the glaring production flaws. Unfortunately, ""El Latigo"" becomes ""El Fatiga."""
4,A good book,"I think this is a good book for you to prepare for the SAT. The Critical Reading section is good. However, you need to be good at Math to master the Math section in this book because this section is pretty hard and has few tips for you."
3,Its OK,"First of all, im not a kid. I'm 16 blah blah, i used kid review b/c i didnt want to sign in.This book wasnt exactly what i was looking for. It has excellent tips and what not, but not much practice. It's just a bunch of reading, acronyms, test taking tips and few questions near the end. So if you're looking for tips, get this, if you want a practice book, get something else- like the book by college board"
2,Not exactly what I would buy next time,"Yes it gives you everything you need for the SAT. But there are some errors and I would say the book is pretty hard to follow. It doesn't really teach you any new despite some techniques, but they are common sense."
4,Pretty Good Book.,"This book is great for any students who can already ace the basic questions. Thus, it focuses on difficult problems and gives you strategies to help you master the Level 4 and 5 questions. I haven't taken the SAT yet, but when I do, I will update my review. My used copy had some markings in the writing sections, but the math sections (the part I needed most) was pristine and untouched."
5,Barron's SAT 2400: Aiming for the Perfect Score,This book really prepares you for the SAT test. I would recommend this to anybody.
2,So Much Hype!,"I didn't like the pre-2008 edition of this book for many reasons. First, it was replete with with ""pep talk,"" which was time-consuming to read and irrelevant to the goal of mastering crucial SAT test-taking skills. Second, it was thin on substance, which may be why the author had to use extra-large fonts to fill up the pages. The few SAT test taking strategies, designed for the so-called ""2400 Club"" members, were nothing you cannot find in most quality SAT prep books. Also, with the pre-2008 edition, the lay-out was so messy that it was actually hard to follow. Finally, having just coached my daughter for the January SAT (in which she scored perfect SAT scores), I think it's misleading to insinuate that one could earn perfect scores on the SAT simply by using this one workbook. From my perspective, nothing short of disciplined work, relentless practice, and a positive mind-set would achieve that. Which is why I have sold this book and, thanks to the hype, at a good price!"
2,Poor examples and ridiculous mnemonics.,"This book is riddled with mistakes in its practice sections (notably the writing section) and contains superfluous mnemonics as a ""strategy."" Incessant use of ""2400 clubbers"" doesn't help. I'd recommend skimming Rocket Review for writing and reading, Gruber's for math, and a solid practice from Collegeboard's ""Blue Book"" of released tests as practice."
4,This book and Grubers are the best on the market,"Reviewing many test prep books, especially SAT books I find that Barrons and Grubers are the best on the market. The price is there and the material is great."
2,No change in the score,"I bought this for my daughter after she received identical scores on two SAT tests. She read this book, did the exercises and guess what? Her third SAT still had the same identical score. She quit SAT's after that."
1,Uneffective,"Real SAT questions are not like the ones in this book. The review strategies are at times silly, especially since they are not applied to actual SAT questions and material. Stick to what College Board releases."
4,Very good book,"The book was great in providing all the guidelines, examples, samples and tricks. I also enrolled my kids in a semi-private class. Together, the book and class helped raise their scores in ACT by at least 2 points."
2,"Decent study guide, but NOT for top scorers","As an SAT prep tutor, I needed a supplementary textbook for my high-flying top scorers, something to challenge them, hold their interest, a collection of questions that would actually be hard for them. This book was not the answer. The questions do not, as a rule, appear any harder than in any of the general SAT prep books for the average student. The techniques and strategies presented are, frankly, lame. Silly mnemonics and corny advice do not engage the smartest kids, or me, or anyone else, probably. I returned the book."
1,Don't waste your time,"I like international movies. I looked forward to this one. Maybe I am too stupid to get it. The film looks great and the acting is good but it is way too confusing. In the end, I did not know if the detective killed himself or he was the person at the very beginning but at that point I was frustrated and not happy with spending 90 minutes watching this. There are so many other great movies, see some of my reviews, why bother with this."
4,"Sgt Preston for truth, justice and the Canadian way.","1950s TV series about a Mountie and his beloved dog, set in the late 1890s Yukon Gold Rush. Think wild woolly western travelling lawman with plenty of snow (the cold and wet kind) and no female companionship whatsoever. Richard Simmons stars as the requisite handsome mustachioed Mountie, derivative of the 1930-1950 Challenge of the Yukon Radio series. Small parts were actually filmed outdoors. There are dogsleds, steamships, telegraphs, Eskimoes, Indians, plus French and English speaking Canadians. Not quite the usual Classic Western, but produced by the same people who did The Lone Ranger. 2nd round of fun stuff."
3,The future housewives,"The book is very particular, it is a suspense story. It is an interesting idea to write about the life of a family, of a wife, who lived in a city and then went to a small village. All is new in Stepford, the work, the school, the surroundings, but above all the wives in the town. The crucial difference is the housework, the women in Stepford do nothing but clean the house, look after the children and cook for their husband.Sometimes it is a bit difficult to understand the story as there are unknown words in some parts. The end is strange there is not a real end, the story is somehow chopped off."
2,Disappointing,"The term, ""Stepford Wife"" is so well-known today, it's hard to believe it all started with this little novella. In it, Joanna and her husband move out of the big city to the idyllic suburb of Stepford, Connecticut, where life seems perfect. Joanna hopes to be active in Women's Lib activities but soon finds all the wives in town want nothing more than to cook and clean. And all the husbands go to the Men's Association every night. Why?Having loved the 1975 movie version ofThe Stepford Wives, I expected the book to be just as intense, but it was a big let-down. The book isn't the least bit scary - or interesting. The writing is spare and uninvolving, the characters sketchy and bland, and there's no action. The story is frozen in 1972 with all the references to Betty Friedan and NOW.If you're looking for thrills and chills, watch the movie. Even the silly 2004 remake is more interesting than the book."
3,I still need to watch the upcoming movie.,"No doubt the plot is chilling. But the book is kinda thin though. I enjoyed reading it throughout.. but the ending rather confusing for me. I've re-read it twice and I even read the afterword. Definitely there's a mystery lays behind it. After all, this is my very first novel by Ira Levin. Can't wait to watch the movie version so I could get a clear ending."
5,Couldn't Put It Down,"I read this book in two days, I couldn't put it down. It's not your typical book where you can only read so much, you just keep reading and reading, and before you know it your already half way throught the book."
4,a strange story,"I have read the book ""The Stepford Wives"" in English at school. We had to read a few pages every week. At the beginning of the book, I thought: What a nonsense!"" When I didn't have to read more, I stopped reading. But I did continue and I must say now I changed my opinion. After the first ten or twenty pages the story became very thrilling.The story is simple. Joanna Eberhart, including her husband and her two children move from a big city to Stepford, a little rural town. The women there are very strange and they are only interested in housework. But Joanna finds a friend, called Bobby, who is not interested in housework either. But then, Bobby has a second honeymoon with her husband, and when she returns she has changed like the other housewives, too. What happened?"
3,A story about human robots,"""Stepford wives"" from Ira Levin. I have read the book at school and I must say that this book is quite easy to understand, but I don't like the story of the book, because I don't like science fiction. And ""Stepford Wives"" is a kind of science fiction. The end of the book was a bit difficult to understand. In the book there are a lot of boring parts. It's a book which you cannot take seriously."
4,Great book!!,"When I first finished this book I was not pleased. I wanted to know EXACTLY what was going on in Stepford and how they were going about transforming all the women into perfect housewives. But after a day or two of thinking it over, I really liked how the book ended...you come to your own conclusion about whats going on.I was also pleased that it wasn't your typical 'bad guy loses...good guy wins' sort of ending. (I don't want to give anything away, so I'll leave it at that.) I've recommended this book to all my family and friends, its a very stimulating quick little read. Can't wait to see the movie."
3,Surprisingly Good!,"I'm giving this 3 stars because of the lenght of the book. The Edition I have from Bloomsbury is only 116 pgs long.Other than that it's actually a very entertaining book. You'd have it read in a couple of hours, so it's kind of like watching a film. Everythin happens in a constant rythym.Joanna, her husband and 2 kids have moved to Stepford. It's a nice, serene place, only not too social. And the women are all TOO good to be true...I'll leave the synopsis at that, everyone knows what The Stepford Wives is about anyway.To sum up, it's funny, suspense filled, but leaves you kind of empty. an extra hundred or two pages, a few extra sub-plots and a little more horror would make it ideal. ;-)"
4,"VERY GOOD, a little incomplete but nontheless VERY GOOD","This is the most fast-reading book you'll ever read in your life! So, you could either like this book or hate it; no in between. It has a good morale and is only about 130 pages. The plot is a little weird but it makes its point; which is ...read the book to find out... {p} One downfall is that it is a little incomplete though. Another variable on wether you'll like it or hate it is if you were alive in 1974, when the story took place. I liked it!"
5,WOW!!!!!!!!,When I saw the movie I had to read the book right away.See I am the type of person that has to read the books that go with the movies.I love reading because I have over 100 books on my kindle.But when I read the books to movies it is all ways different.
3,A funny book without a happy ending,The whole story with was very funny in my opinion. I really liked the robots and their vacuum cleaners. Bobbie was always good for a joke and Joanna brought her back to reality when Bobbie thought that the whole town of Stepford was poisoned by some computer factories.
3,The ending is unbelievable!,"We read the Stepford wives"" in English class. I really liked it!Joanna, a very nice and brave woman who tries to fight against the Men's Association from Stepford, and even tries to fight against her own husband - just to live her life and to keep her own identity.I found the book good. I read it twice. But the end of the book was unbelievable, because I thought the book had a happy ending, but it did not turn out that way!!The book was really easy to understand."
2,Uneasy and lots of question marks,"I felt uneasy when I read this book. It's not that kind of thriller I expected. I don't know why the story irritated me. Is it because I am a female or I am not an american so that I cannot appreciate the sarcasm? If it's a thriller, I believe, it's only for women. Maybe it points out the deepest fear for women. Also the story leaves me many question marks. If it's not the structural problem of the story, it must be my lack of knowledge for western style literature or american culture. However, I agree with the excellence of how the author schedules the story. He did tell a four-month-long story, not just picked some time points out, and, in the meanwhile, still kept reader interested in the story."
4,stepford wives,"**** A REALLY MALE CHAUVINISTIC BOOK!I liked this book, it was a good sience fiction book. The Stepford Wives"" was easy to read, because all the new words were explain.The only thing that I didn't like was that the men won. I think the women were all really stupid!They didn't help themselves. They just looked on how they were going to be killed. I think the end would have been a better if the women had also changed the men! When you read the book, you really feel that a man has written it. I would recommend this book to all people, who like sience fiction."
4,Fun read!,"I consider myself quite liberated but this is a refreshing look at a world that used to exist, if that makes any sense. And, it's great fun. Levin is a fine writer as shown by Rosemary's Baby. Son of Rosemary sucked, though lol.This book definitely makes a fun companion with both the old version of the movie, and the newer one, too."
4,good plot; too simplistic?,I saw the review for the movie in theaters but I thought there would be more if I read the book. I was wrong! Good plot; I just wish that there was more to it. It's less than 200 pages and I read it in two days to find out more but I just didn't find that edge. I wanted to know more about what the men were thinking ; twist it up make her sound more crazier or more sane.
3,3 cd set from the new music seminar-1989,"island records 3cd sampler of releases from 1989 was the most ambitious giveaway at that years music industry get together in new york. 1 rock cd, 1 reggae/international cd and 1 dance/r&b; disc.a few notable tracks from well known artists like u2, melissa etheridge, peter himmelman,black uhuru,ali farka toure,nana vasconcelos,sly & robbie and womack & womack are highlights but don't ignore the unknown artists.go back to 1989 and enjoy!!"
4,awesome blanket,this baby blanket is perfect. bought it for my nephew and he loves it. it's really soft and quite big so it is easy to wrap the baby in it
5,"Great, COZY swaddler",My daughter was born in Dec so this was great for the cold weather! We wrapped this around her in her PJs even! SO CUTE and very easy to do. I HIGHLY recommend swaddling your baby to get more sleep (for both PARENTS and BABY)!
3,Nice but not necessary,"This is a lovely blanket, and our new little girl loves to be swaddled at night. We registered for one of these blankets and ended up buying it ourselves when we didn't get one. It's very soft and a good size; however, the swaddling instructions being attached is just a gimmick in my opinion. You can buy equally nice blankets for a lot less money and get swaddling instructions from many baby books, online, from the neonatal nursing staff at a hospital or birthing center, or from your doctor or midwife. You really don't need a special blanket to swaddle as long as the blanket is big, and, once you learn how, you don't need instructions attached to the blanket."
5,Wonderful book for kids of Chinese ethnicity,"I got this book as a gift for my Eurasian children and loved it right away. It's educational, fun, and beautifully illustrated. I highly recommend it."
4,"Good, but not as great as Easterman's others.","This book is very entertaining and quite enjoyable. However, it is not as good as any of Easterman's others. Still, I believe that he is the best author out there today. Allthough it was not as great as his other books, it is still worth a read."
1,"Like gliding on ice, deadly ice.","This mobile base went together in just five minutes. The steel and wheels are all of good quality material. Caution! When I was cutting a 24"" X 48"" X 5/8""piece of plywood, the tablesaw started to tip due to only one wheel at one end. This almost cost me severe injury to the face as the blade was still running. Talking to techs at HTC, they tell me I would be better off with the ""four wheel"" mobile base for tablesaws. This stand is being returned and I am buying the HTC 2000 as recommended by the HTC tech team. The one star is for the quality of this product, not safety."
2,Not good for me,"I am the matematican and I had to start learning C.M. from this book. And I didn't like it. First chapter is some very simplified approach to linear elasticity, but it doesn't developed any intuition and reading it was waste of time. Stretch tensor was introduced with avoided notion of polar decomposition. This presentation was far less intuitive for me. The linear algerbra behind primal stresses is described and computed in details, but nowadays the student involved in computer methods and engineering must know this things in my opinion. And the language is not instuitive: me, matematican, couldn't do most of exercises after reading chapter they relate to. It tasted like old-fashioned book."
5,Great Service,"My book came within only a few days despite being shipped from Tawain. I was very impressed, and the book was in great condition!"
2,Backsmart book,"I have had recurring back issues for quite some time (12 years) and have done lenghty research to help aleviate pain and improve performance. With that being said, I found this book to be entirely too basic for me. Much of what's covered are sretches and abdominal and bicep exercises.....very little lower/upper back exercises. If you're an athlete or somebody who's been active consistently, you probably won't find your answers in this book. However, for older or non-exercising individuals, this book has decent basic guidlines and is decent starter information."
2,disappointed,"I checked the reveiws before buying this book and was really excited but was very disappointed. I found the many exercises overwhelming and confusing. If I did only half of the stretches and exercises in the book, I would be doing exercises around the clock"
5,Excellent lower back rehab program,Follow this book and your lower back problem is most likely to improve. Use along with chiropractic and physical therapy treatment.
2,Only for former athletes,"This book was a total waste of time and money for me. This book might be good if you are a former athelete, has has experience with exercises of this kind and had people coach you in the past. For an Electric Engineer like me that has back pain due to spending 12 hours sitting behind a computer screen, this is way to overwhelming.The stretches alone took me forever to understand and almost an hour to go through. After that I was so sore that I couldn't excercice on the next day or so.I still believe the best approach is to look for professional help. In one hour, a qualified instructor can demonstrate how to do things properly without getting hurt."
5,My Backsmart review,"I decided that the book deserved a 5 star for it's thorough coverage of exercise and weight training. In that sense, the workouts covered are good for everyone, no matter what eating plan they are following (as long as it's healthy). Maybe that's even better. If you are following an eating plan that makes sense for you, is healthy and varied, and are ready to add weight training into the mix, this book is for you.If you are ready to even take your routine up a notch, are doubting your form, are not seeing the results you wish, then this book is for you, too. It's great. It's as informative as Body for Life by Bill Phillips and as well written which I used for over a year. Additionally, The Backsmart is more flexible with the workout routines and exercises, and explains how to vary them. There aren't a lot of books for beginners on this subject. And, again, this book isn't just for beginners, it's really for anyone interested in fitness. Completely recommended."
1,mail box review,"The box is not built solid enough. The housing is too thin. The doors do not close well enough and the hinges are inadequate.The concept of two doors is a great idea, but it needs to be built stronger."
1,sucker,Waste of money unless you enjoy watching someone else's home videos of rining on some un-impressive trails. I thought it was a Trials video not Trails. I was looking to see some skilled riders going over rocks and other obstacles. Not some regular guys out riding on the weekend.
4,cool but exp. needed,"a very cool model roughly looks like the jurassic park t-rex, if you already build models this should b no prob. its a very good size as mentioned, may need to fill the seems with a filler to look alittle more natural, overall i would say this model is worth it, im pretty pleased with it."
2,hat,I needed a Jamaican winter hat so got this one. I don't like it at all. I thought the yellow stripe was the same as the flag colour so to me it throws off the whole thing.
1,Save your money for therapy,"This is a collection of amateurish poetry written by a woman recovering from DID. It is of little or no help to fellow survivors. I felt like I was reading her diary, with no editing or cohesiveness. Apparently, each of her identities uses a different font, some barely legible. Fortunately, none of them write in WingDing."
4,Funky Jamz,"My friends and I enjoyed this ""blast from our past""! They knew the beat and the ""hook"" but couldn't remember the artist or the name of the title song. ""Right On Time"" was a pleasant surprise as we all knew this song but didin't know the same group performed it. Thanks Amazon.com for a great listing of ""oldies""."
4,forgotten funk and dusty grooves,"This is a great collection of obscure party gems that will keep the old schoolers rockin'.West-coast rap pioneers, Low Profile,sampled ""Funky Song"" on thier late eighties debut,""We're In This Together"".If you like Tower of Power,you'll love Ripple!"
3,"Not Perfect, But A Great Indie Drama!","Me, Tommy And The Brothers is a very rare thing, an indie drama that works! Most of the time, indie dramas fall apart from over-acting or a script that's so 'high school' that it's just silly. Me, Tommy And The Brothers doesn't suffer from any of that, this is a movie that's clearly set in the real world. This story of friends who have grown up together and are maturing is something that everyone will be able to identfy with. Giving away the story would absolutely ruin this great movie!Now, it's not perfect, the video and audio suffer from the technology of the time (1998), it's not digital and there are times when the video is a bit dark, but that's rare and not too distracting once you get into the story...and you WILL be drawn into the story!It's a great movie and it's well worth your time and money!"
1,Poor quality,"This item arrived crooked, scratched and is very poor quality. I wish I would have spent more on a better item."
2,5 Drawer Companion,"I had looked for something just like this that was priced right for a long time. When I saw it advertised on Amazon I placed an order. A week to the day after it was received I saw one in WalMart that was much higher quality for about the same price. After paying transportation charges and sacrificing quality, it became clear that it was no bargain"
3,good,"It's a shame Kathy(his mother) never wrote this book.By far the most imtimate and well written part of this book was the last chapter that Kathy Eldon wrote.Obviously Jennifer New loves Dan's life like we all do but unfortuneatly she never met him and that glaringly stands out in the biography. There is way too much creative license here,the fact he is raised to almost sainthood can be squeemish at times.Jennifer's writing leaves a lot to be desired, but through the clumsy writing you can't helped but be inspired by the life of Dan Eldon.Dan is amazing!! His photos say more about him than any bunch of words can. 'The Journey is the destination"" is a must have book!!Flip through that and I guarentee your life will be changed forever!"
3,Cancer Again?,"I LOVED the first book, The Hot Flash Club, and couldn't wait to read this sequel. One of the best things about the first book was it was light, fun, and I could relate to all the women in some way, and it didn't have some typical depressing story about someone dying of cancer as most books do. Well, this book sadly joined the ""depressing cancer story"" club. As you may know, the 4 main characters return in the book, and are joined by 4 new women who are interesting, but not half as fun and light-hearted as the original ""club"". The worst story was about Polly, who's MIL, who stated out as a really interesting character, ended up suffering from cancer and slowly dying for most of the book. It was heartbreaking. I really don't understand why writers find the need to always include a long suffering cancer patient in their stories. I'm now struggling to finish the book. I will take a break before I read the next installment in the series."
5,Good read very entertaining,Read the hot flash club first.the ladies are so real and funny.i hope they make a movie out of the three books .I wish there was another book.
3,Too much hype,"While a lot of the percussion is interesting, this just isn't an album that I ever want to sit and listen through all the way. I admire a lot of what the band is trying to accomplish on this album (which is why I gave it three stars overall), but I can't say I enjoy listening to all of it. So 4 stars for performance but 2 stars for likeability averages out to 3 stars."
5,Probably better than being there,"Somehow I seem to enjoy these BluRay DVDs better than actually being there. Sure are a great reminder of what one has seen on holiday, without having to worry about being pick-pocketed or ripped off and, you don't have to worry about the weather either."
4,Worth it,"This is a great disc to own, It has amazing picture & sound quality. Something we all expect from Blu Ray discs. Rudy Maxa is a great Host & gives us several tips which include even where to buy bus tickets, what to look for at a bus stop etc. there are maps of the location..all this & more, which should be helpfull to all foregin travellers who can sometimes get confused in places like these.The photography & music are first grade & this is the next best thing to being there.now for the drawbacks : There is just not enough of Italy shown, considering the storage capacity of Blu Ray discs a lot more could have been included. plus some extra features like interactive maps, best & worst seasons to visit, List of festivals & local Holidays, Important Italian phrases or words & their english translation etc should also have been included."
4,Excellent Video and some good traveler suggestions,"Very good introduction to visiting Italy. Some excellent traveler tips are included. Gives good overview and feel of visiting Venice, Florance, and Rome."
2,"Jackets, Coats and Suits","&#65279;While this book had some tid-bits about how to copy famous designer's work, it is mainly a advertisement for the designers and other merchants.I purchased this book to improve my tailoring skills. The small amount of information contained within the book was not worth the purchase price. But, most important it was not worth my time."
3,Better than the stock mirror,This mirror is a step up from the stock mirror on my Honda Civic but it could be better. I would recommend this one for carrying along when travelling for use in rental cars. Otherwise I would try to get one wih either more curve to expand the view or else a larger model.-tgusnik
2,Not for everyone,"This mirror provides the extra visibility I was looking for but it makes everything look a little smaller than in the OEM rear-view. That's not a big deal, but it also gives me a headache to look at it. It's like looking through prescription glasses that don't belong to you."
1,Pay attention to recent reviews.,"I ordered this mirror in 2008 and it was great until it broke. We liked it enough to replace it with the same mirror. Unfortunately they ""just don't make them like they used to"". Within one day of installing this mirror the glue holding the mirror melted. The mirror fell out of the housing and glue dripped on my car seat and console. I'm not sure if this glue is ever going to come off.Pay attention to recent reviews that represent the opinions of the currently manufactured mirror. Ignore older reviews since they are for a mirror that was of different construction. To put it bluntly, this mirror is a cheap pos.Hopefully Amazon removes this item soon as this seems to be a common complaint.You have been warned."
3,Increases Area of Rear View; Does not Fit with Onstar Controls,"This mirror does increase the area of rear view and helps people who have limited mobility of the neck. It is very easy to clip on regular rear view mirror.But it does not fit the rear view mirror if you have a GM car with Onstar controls on the rear view mirror. Other disadvantage is glare at night, so much that you cannot use it at night."
2,distorts the image,makes me feel cross-eyed when looking into it. so much so that were it not so cheap i'd return it. you might consider one of the more expensive ones instead. maybe they have better optics.
1,"Pay for a better one, this is awful","I owned this for two weeks. In the second week in Houston heat I noticed some glue squeezing out the bottom, I wasn't worried and didn't mind it because it still what it was supposed to do. I mostly park in a garage, but for 5 hours that one day I had parked it outside. The glass fell out of the holder, and glue melted all over my car. Made a huge mess, and the glass fell right out. I want to return it, but I'm having trouble with that as well."
4,Effective,"WOW... and I say that because of the view behind me has been magnified... it requires some getting used to, especially directly behind you... judging the distance of the person following behind you takes some practice... so, don't be overwhelmed, just give time to become familiar with it... BTW, with all respect for those who struggle with their sight, this is an effective tool and I would strongly suggest purchasing one."
1,it was awful.....,just too cheaply made. Too distorted view. Not useable at all. Save your money. no no no no no no no
5,Good investment,"The car mirror was a very good investment. These days, when there are so many cazy drivers, it helps to have a wide view of what people are doing all around you while you are driving. This wide view mirror takes a way that worry. I highly recommend this product to all who get behind the wheel."
2,"low quality, not wide enough.","In few days mirror unglued and fell off while it was a hot day...Stuck it back on, same thing happened again. Not wide enough for an SUV. Returning back."
4,useful,"I'm driving a small car (Mazda3) so maybe the car's not long enough to reflect both blind spots: i.e., I see the passenger-side blind spot well with this mirror, but my head &/or the pillar of the car's rear window seems to block the driver's side blind area. Clipped on in a second, though & is secure. Looks nice...I think in a car of greater overall length, this mirror would perform at a 5-star level."
1,HORRIBLE.,"WORST. MIRROR. EVER.I bought this mirror TWICE. And both times, the mirror fell out of the compartment and the glue dripped onto my car. Given it DOES provide a good view when in use, it is not worth the money because it will potentially melt and drip this sticky and hard to remove glue into your car. It would be way better if they just super glued the mirror onto the plastic frame instead of using a rubbery glue that melts at hot-ish conditions. (For reference, my car was parked in the shade in 90 degree weather.)DO NOT BUY UNLESS YOU WANT TO SPEND HOURS AND MONEY TRYING TO PEEL AND RUB GLUE OFF YOUR CAR."
2,Melted,"5/29/2012, SF Bay Area: The mirror portion finally fell-off today, after the glue holding it to the frame melted the rest of the way. It melted quite a bit last summer, but did not fall-off and held tight through this past winter. Lasted just about one year. We got good use out of it during that time, but will look for a different vendor to replace it now."
2,Not suited for extremely hot weather,"After 6 months when I bought this CIPA 34000 11.75"" Panoramic Rearview Clip-On the plastic frame melted at almost 100F temperature.[...]"
1,Not suitable for WARM weather like Florida!!,"I've had this mirror since March 2011. I bought this to replace the one that had and broke. Although, it provides very good visibility and it serves the purpose in that regard, it has tow very major issues (at leat the one that I received has):1- The mirror shakes and vibrates like crazy. Some times it vibrates so much that I have to take it off. At first I thought I might have installed the wrong way. I tried couples of different ways but it did shake and vibrate in all different positions. I also tried it on couple of different rental cars as well, same story.2- I live in Florida so my car stay in sun for longer periods of time. In just 3 or 4 months since I got this, the glue that holds the actual mirror to the frame is started to melt and drip from bottom of the fram and it is meesing up my dash.So, I will be throwing this piece of junk into the trash and off to getting a new one."
1,the other review was right,"This thing does give you headache and take a long time to get used to.I bought it because it is cheaper than the rest but the mirror somehow doesn't give accurate reflections due to the curvature, so not only the cars behind you look much smaller, it also sort of distort the view so it takes extra effort on your eyes to adjust every time you look at it.I am now searching for another one since it is too much hassle to return it.I wouldn't recommend this product."
2,Panoramic rearview mirror,My son had a injury were his vision was impaired I bought this to help him. The mirror worked well .The problem I had was that the glue that holds the mirror in the plastic that clips onto your existing mirror melted all over my sons dashboard. I would not recommend this item unless they change the glue. It needs to be able to tolerate the heat from the sun.
1,Awful,It is the composer's fault. This kind of music should not be released as a recording.Let's forget about this composer.
2,"A mediocre, amateur recording","This recording is completely amateur in ev'ry way. Choral entrances tend to be sloppy, the choral blend is mediocre, and the singing is completely uninspired. The recording itself sounds like somebody happened to show up at the performance with a couple of microphones and a tape deck, so they thought: What the heck, let's stash the microphones, oh, how about over here, and make a recording.For real excellence, try the one by Paul Hillier and company."
5,"Brilliant analysis, bracing scholarship, delightful insights","A welcomed and surprising analysis, placed in historical context and revealing meanings and subtexts that had never previously occurred to this reader in a lifetime of reading the classics. Absolutely grand."
1,Only 12 Songs and The Mastering is Horrible!!,"Only 12 songs for a guy who had 17 chart records? Also, the tracks were taken off a vinyl records as opposed to the original master tapes. What a rip off! There are much better collections on the market by Luther."
2,low quality,"This hammer is very low quality,At the price I wasn't expecting much but the hammer I received wasn't even useable without working on it.The handle says its hickory but it very soft and feels weak,I doubt its gonna last long.The head of the hammer was very loose,the handle didn't fit right and they had jammed an extra swedge in it trying to tighten it up.Even with two swedges pounded into it I was still able to pull the head off,since I needed the hammer and didn't want to mess with returning a $12 hammer i cut the handle down to a thicker spot then turned it down till it fit tight. Now with just one swedge it fits as it should.Once the cheap handle breaks and I get another one it should be an ok hammer but once I buy a good handle I could have just bought a name brand hammer."
1,Drivel for the proles,"Cussler's consistent bestseller status if proof of the failure of American education, the rise of general illiteracy, and the decline of Western Civilization.Frightening that millions can consider these books compelling. This book would have insulted my intelligence when I was 12."
2,Off the deep end,"I have read and enjoyed many Cussler books, and though this one was mildly entertaining it was way out there as far the plot goes. If you haven't read Cussler before don't let this be your first, there are many more that are much better."
5,Deep Six,"As all of his previous endeavors to entertain, Cussler has done an excellent job. We have been following his publications for several years and look forward to completing out collection through the 'reasonable' offers through Amazon.com."
4,Not what I expected.,"This is the second Cussler book I read, Inca Gold being the first. I thought Inca Gold was awesome, but Deep Six just doesn't live up to the former. It's still an enjoyable read, so pick it up."
3,Another Dirk Pitt wanger banger,"A Korean pirate empire that topples a president by kidnapping him is the centerand Dirk Pitt is right in the middle getting paddled with oarsand shot at by cannon.The Old South rises again with a Rebel yelland the brain washing is finished in the sinking of a boat.There is less archaeology involved than in the other two in this series that I've read but the international political mix upmore than makes up for that with Communism making a last standbefore the Berlin walls fell.With another antique car biting the dust while there are sinking shipsand deadly nerve gas loose, you get your adventure bang for you reading timewith very little real hard intellectual chores involved!?"
5,Another piece of sheer entertainment!,"Yes, Clive Cussler has done it again. This is one of his best and definitely one of his most entertaining novels. Sheer, non-stop escapism. Forget some of the seemingly far-fetched ideas that seem inspired by James Bond movies and ENJOY! I won`t want to give more plot away, read it for yourselves. This would make a great movie actually."
3,Steve Prefontaine Poster,"The item was just as described. Had some problems with communication on the delivery, but the company made every effort to reconcile the issues after I contacted them."
3,Beware Of This Vendor,"The quality of the print aside, (Not Good). Be careful when you are purchasing prints from this vendor. Numerous complaints concerning overcharging on S&H. One click ordering with this vendor will not reveal to you the exorbitant charges you will incur. Read the feedback. Not happy at all."
2,Tacky and boring,"I can't get into this CD. The only songs I can even stand to listen to are ""Waves"" ""Jackie Cane"" and ""Renaissance Affair"" and one of those was on their second album anyway! I don't know if they were going for a tacky-ish, retro techno type sound but tracks like ""Everytime we live together we die a bit more"" are unbearable to listen to. I can't recommend this CD, despite ""Jackie Cane"" and ""waves"" which are actually quite good (the 2 stars I gave this CD are for those two songs, the rest, are ........). However, some people apparently love this CD. There's no accounting for taste, eh?"
3,Album undecided.....,"After many listens, I have concluded that this CD isnt all that bad. It surely does not measure up to the previous albums. This album can grow on you. Give it a chance. Also, I saw some reviews where people are saying ""do not compare this album to their others"". Well, without comparison we are non-existing. When you eat steak at one steak house and then steak at another, how do you decide which is the better of the two? HMMM! Thought prevoking, isn't it? Also, I read another reviewers post saying that the first two albums taught her something....Geike didn't use her voice to full potential. Well, it would have been hard for her to on ANSSS because she wasn't even on it. She didn't pop up until the second album. Get facts straight before you review an album and ""compare"" it to the others."
1,"Big departure, and I'm leaving with it.","I was all happy the other day when I saw this album on the shelf (had no idea it was out). The little ""featuring song from VW beetle ad"" sticker should have alerted me about what was ahead, as that song is Renaissance Affair from the Blue Wonder Power Milk album. The album starts out quite nicely with the first two tracks and quickly becomes very boring, bland pop music. It finally (believe me I barely made it through the whole album) ended with the ""VW tune"" as the marketers have dubbed it. But I already have that song, on a far better album.Say trip-hop and acid jazz are long dead, I don't care, I still happen to like it. Hooverphonic has obviously departed from the sound on their previous albums, and I'm leaving with it. So if you really like the two first albums, be careful with this one.."
4,Pretty Good,"I don't find this as good as their other albums but if you like Hooverphonic, you should probably have this in your collection."
4,It's Good but not there best.,I still really liked this CD but it was almost missing something.It's still a really good cd but it needed something else to make it what there past ones have been.I did notice that her voice seems alot stronger in this album though.It's good just to have all the same:)
2,Hooverphonic's starting to ...,"I was looking forward to hearing this CD. I've listened to some of the tracks from the older cds (""A New Stereophonic Sound Spectacular "" and ""Blue Wonder Power Milk "") over and over again, especially ""Battersea"" and Eden"" from BWPM plus ""2wicky"" and ""Revolver"" from NSSS.Unfortunately this latest CD is really cheesy. The only track I thought was worth adding to my MP3 collection was ""Autoharp."" Rennaissance Affair is also good, but it was on BWPM so it doesn't count. ""Everytime We Live Together"" sounds like an attempted Portishead ... and not nearly as good as the real thing. ""Vinegar and Salt"" made me think of Goth ABBA.I highly recommend Hooverphonic's previous work, but steer clear of this one"
4,The Tree Grows...,"A lot of bands whose first lp is considered fantastic then either continue to follow that format or move on to other things. Hooverphonic has been evolving their sound for three albums now. While Sound Spectacular was a knob-twiddlers delight, Blue Wonder Power Milk progressed towards progressive pop-song structure, the Magnificent Tree continues that progression. Most bands have a hard time escaping a formula successfully. Morcheeba could be criticized for the same thing. Losing the ""trip-hop"" feel. I believe a mark of a good band is one that internally evolves its musical goals and tries to create something new and exciting each time. Too many bands find their niche and stay, making for bland music. If anything, Hooverphonic isn't bland. Their's is a melange of melodies, influences and atmosphere. While it doesn't always succeed, it does have its pleasurable moments and still should be a part of the Hooverphonic collection."
2,don't get me wrong...,"Don't get me wrong, I love Hooverphonic. They're one of my favorite bands. But compared with their first two albums, this one is terrible. I think they tried to be too ""popular"" in a cheap way, using hackneyed phrases like ""We'll always be best friends/Something between you and me..."" that are at best empty and worthy of being lines from an episode of a teeny-bopper sitcom/drama. This may sound silly, but one of the things I loved about their older albums was the way you couldn't tell what Geike was really singing, and when you did figure it out, the words made no sense. Now their songs seem to be about relationships (of all overdone things!) in a really unoriginal way (e.g., ""Every time we live together we die a bit more,"" etc.). Anyway, they still have a pretty decent sound, although noticeably deliberate, and I do adore the song ""Waves."" It's the only one you can really listen to without having to consciously block out the sickeningly trite words."
2,What is this?,"im convinced this isnt really hooverphonic. It doesnt even come close to the quality of their other two CDs. I loved A New Stereophonic.. and all though Blue Wonder.. lost a little bit of the mellow techno part of the first CD it was still full of great songs. TMT has lost EVERYTHING. its like listenin to really bad pop. i admit Mad About You is very catchy and Waves can take you away. but other than that... if youve been a fan of Hooverphonic for so long like me, do your self a favor and dont disapoint yourself. If anyone wants to get a Hooverphonic CD please get one of the first two, just pretend this one was never released. I hope Alex does a better job next time."
1,a bad characature,"I was sorely disappointed with Hooverphonic's third release The Magnificent Tree. Not only is the title ridiculous, but the sound is like a bad characature of their first two albums. They tried to continue the previously wonderful trademark sound, but it just falls completely flat and derivative. This album is damn near unlistenable, except for the re-issued final track which capitalized on the TV commercial. I had to use mine as a frisbee because I couldn't stand the site of it anymore."
2,Very disappointed,"Did anyone notice that the song ""The Magnificent Tree"" is a total rip-off of CSN's Guenivere? I really liked the first two albums but this one just shows what a true sell-out this band really is. They're lyrics were never really that intelligent but on this album they're down right juvenile. Good pop gone bad."
5,"Finally, they made it.","ANSSS and BWPM taught me two things. First, Geike Arnaert has one of the most thrilling voices in the popular music scene today. Second, she didn't dare to use it. We also learned that Hooverphonic can produce the most amazing songs, now and then.With The Magninficent Tree it all seems to come together. An arrangement leaning towards sythpop with a bit of trip-pop thrown in and traditional top quality glam-pop songwriting. It took three albums, but now it seems that they manage to put together a full album of Good Songs. And Geike finally finds the self confidence to bloom as a vocalist.As some have stated, they have strayed far far away from the traditional trip-hop that coloured ANSSS. But who cares. The songs are simply better written and performed this time. And that's what really matters.Ok, I doubt anything will ever beat Inhaler, but as an album, this is Hooverphonics best effort so far."
3,Descent into lameness...,"As my friend used to put it; this cd marked Hooverphonic's ""descent into lameness."" ""A New Stereophonic Sound Spectacular"" will always be their best. ""No More Sweet Music"" is a hopefull turn back for them. I have the 2 album version which has a more agressive mix on it- it is better. The newer singer is limited though- she cracks up here and there on the NMSM cd. Their first 2 cd's are great."
5,An outstanding offering,"I feel, having read other customer reviews, I must put in a good word for this cd. I was familiar with Hooverphonic only because I heard their single ""Club Montepulciano"" on a sampler cd. When I saw their cd in a store, I decided to give it a listen. I fell in love with the cd immediately.Perhaps this is not their best cd, as other customers have stated. But that just excites me, because that means that I will probably only love the next ones I buy even more. Still, as a stand alone cd, I think it's great and one of the best cds I've bought in a long time. Definetely worth buying!"
2,Another one bites the dust,"Well, with this release Hooverphonic joins Morcheeba and Tricky on the list of trip-hop/acid-jazz artists who seem to be more interested in mainstream crossover than producing the intriguing/hypnotic music that gave them their notoriety.This is a collection of slick electronic pop music - nothing more, nothing less.Music: slickly produced, easily forgottenLyrics: vapid to the point of being irritatingVocals: lovely as usual, but...One more nail in the coffin of the trip-hop movement. Too bad."
4,Mad about this album,"First single `Mad About You' was a classic, and still is. This alone is worth while checking out this terrific third album. I must say, I have never heard their first two albums, but it seems impossible that those can top this effort. It's packed with beautiful atmospheric, dramatic sounding anthems. Some very uplifting (current single `Jackie Cane'), some very sweet (`Out Of Sight') and some very haunting (`Vinegar & Salt'). Best thing about this band is the incredible vocal perfomance by singer Geike Arnaert. She has this rare beautifully moving high-pitched voice, which reminds me to the vocals on Goldfrapp or Portishead albums. Quoting Q Magazine: this might do well at weddings or dinner parties. I recommend this album to anyone who's into nice sounding, yet warm interesting music."
4,staring into space,"Great music for mellowing out at the end of the workday....or at the start, when you're still in that not-quite-here-yet state. Moody but not dark. Quirky but not weird. Poppish but not mainstream. Altogether, a good album for just chillin' . . . or staring into space."
1,Why not to buy,"If you enjoyed ""A New Stereo Sound Spectacular"" and enjoy various artist like, Esthero, Lamb, Thievory Corporation, Litany, Mulu, Baxter, Sneaker Pimps, etc... you won't enjoy there last two albums. I don't know what happen to the group, but they lost their energy. The music is lacking the feel of acid jazz, and has become more of a slow jazz album. Don't be fooled by the other reviews. I have listed other artists above that I enjoy. If you enjoy what I listen to, then be warned, stay away from Blue Wonder Power Milk and The Magnificent Tree."
2,Look Before You Leap,"Before I begin, let me just say that I am a major fan of Hooverphonic's first album - mesmerized by almost every song. It was one of those CD's that everyone else who wasn't in tune with my taste would get sick of because I never took it out of my CD player.Since then, however, I have found their albums less daring and 'out-there' and more forced - especially Magnificent Tree. I feel that the majority of the singles are simply trying too hard to be quirky while more focus should be directed toward crafting good songs.It is one of those albums that you force yourself to listen to all the tracks because of your history with the group, but one that eventually becomes a two-track album. Those two tracks are ""Mad About You"" and ""Out of Sight."" While these two songs - OK, maybe also ""Jackie Cane"" - were strong enough for me to keep listening, the rest are generally forgettable.Fan or first-time listener, take this venture out for a test-drive before you buy."
2,Not their best...take a pass...,"I'm not an electro-pop fan but I happen to have bought a couple Hooverphonic CDs many years ago. This one leaves me quite cold. If you want something better by this group I'd suggest ""Blue Wonder Power Milk"" which is pretty catchy somehow. It's a much better CD than the inaptly named ""Magnificent Tree."""
3,dr and quinch,Good for Alan Moore fans. A humourous stroll through the minds of two psychopaths who reject the sanctioned madness otherwise known as society. Moore always adds an interesting twist to the mundane realities that surround us. I wish it could have been longer but it collects all his work with these two characters. Good quality print but I somehow felt it was too short and thus a tad overpriced.
3,Alan Moore,This a fairly good comic. It does go a little crazy at times. I bought it bacause I am an Alan Moore fan. I do really like his League of Extraordinary Gentleman.
2,Not a favorite.,"I bought this treat for my 2 small dogs, and neither of them liked it. They are extrmely fussy though, so it may be a great treat for other dogs, just not mine."
1,Poor Quality recording,"The one that I puchashed was muffully sounding.(cassette,New)Be carefull when choosing a seller."
5,Amazing Footage,I thought both programs were great. An amazing look inside our nations oldest National Park.
3,"One for the family, one not...Christmas in Yellowstone is great.","We watch ""Christmas in Yellowstone"" every year - it's become a tradition. It's a great family feel-good doc showing the beauty of Yellowstone around the holiday season. But ""In the Valley of the Wolves"", although beautifully shot and interesting, is definitely not for all family members. The 'harsh realities of nature' may be fine to witness for adults, but may be too intense and downright depressing for younger or more sensitive viewers. Several killings (and eating of carcasses) are portrayed, and wolf/coyote deaths are rampant. Bummer. 5 huge Stars for ""Christmas in Yellowstone"", maybe 3 for ""In the Valley of the Wolves"", with a bit of warning. Both features shot in High Def."
2,Not my favorite knife,"The handle is listed as being aircraft aluminum, but it feels like hard plastic to me. I'm a big fan of Kershaw knives, and I bought this for my brother-in-law for Christmas. I'm pretty sure he wouldn't be thrilled with the handle, so I'll return it and pick him up a different one!"
5,Life Saver!,"This book helped me get two As in the class! It's simply explained and the author gives you a GREAT understanding of the building blocks of A&P; I and II. Do yourself a favor and buy this book, and the best part is it's 7 bucks!Good Luck!"
5,Spectre chrome heater hose fittings,Spectre chrome heater hose fittings arrived fast and in perfect condition. No problems or issues so far with leakage or discoloration.
4,Beautiful,"I was set to buy a rear-projection TV when I saw this model in a show-room. It had a near photograph quality picture, and I could not pass it up.I got Voom Satellite this week, and now I can say that the picture quality on this TV is excellent. The High-Definition stations look like photographs."
5,Great product!,"I have missed having an Auto Dimming mirror on my MX-5.After doing research, I found this product. Not only is it auto dimming, but it has the built in compass (nice to have but not necessary) and the temperature readout. (Something I also missed from my RX-8)I didn't install it myself, as I was unsure of running the wires to the front of my car. I'm really happy with how it works, and how it looks.If you are thinking of getting one, it's great! I have map lights in my car already, so save some money on the 36500 or the 36501. It works like a charm as far as the auto dim goes.You won't be disappointed. (Well, i hope you won't!)"
2,Doesn't fit a 2011 Honda Accord,"I'm afraid I've wasted $275 on this and warn everyone to be careful. A buddy of mine tried to take off the mount that holds the standard 2011 Honda Accord mirror and broke my windshield, which cost $200 to replace. I've taken this rear view mirror with temp and compass everywhere. No one will touch it for fear of breaking the glass. I've been to five auto parts stores and no one has a mount that both fits on the Honda factory-installed mount (which is epoxied to the glass) and on the CIPA 26400 rearview mirror. Thus, I have no idea if the product is any good. Worse, by taking all this time, I was too late to return the mirror to Amazon for a refund. My advice: Don't buy this product without assurances from the manufacturer that he will supply the needed mount."
4,Essential Bible Dictionary,The Essential Bible Dictionary is a great resource for those who desire to futher their concept of 'faith seeking understanding'. It is another helpful to a good Study Bible. It is very worth the reasonalbe price.
3,!?!?!?!?!?!?,"If I ever get a real kit, these will probably sound awesome... but I was just looking for something with a nylon tip to protect my goodwood mods rock band drum kit, the wood is said to degrade the mesh more quickly. I found these sticks are much too heavy for my purpose, and it's probably due to the paint.overall, these sticks are just okay....I didn't think the paint would bother me, but I really hate the feel. The paint screws with my grip and I find myself gripping the sticks too high just to keep a thumb on the wood.the price was right anyway, just bought a pair of Vic Firths... I'll throw these things in a drawer and take them out when I need them.I will say, on a stock RB2 kit or Ion kit where you don't have to replace the heads every few months... these things will work just fine for you.2.5/5"
3,DrumSticks,Kids wanted them and she was happy with them and uses them everyday so i guess they where good enough for her.
5,perfect drumsticks,"I personally recomend this type of drum sticks... i've being playing drums for 7 years.. and is the first time i used this ones..... i really like it... they are very confortable..they make your snare ,,, cymbals sound clear... and most important they are light, i would recomend this drumsticks to any one cause they do the job perfectly... jose M"
4,Good,"I chose by brand and by price. Shiping rates according TO the ítem, durable material and comfortable TO play my drums"
2,not to good,"so, i got these sticks with the the 5b sticks, and decided i liked these sticks better than the others because they are a little bit smaller around than the others. when i had been playing about 45 minutes, my hands felt really warm, and they were red, which hadn't happened with sticks that didn't have the rubber grip at the bottom. after about an 1 1/2, i did a really fast and hard song with 16th notes on the high hat, and it rubbed a bunch of skin off and burned really bad. if you want sticks that will rub your hands raw, go ahead and get these. if not, look for another brand."
2,"""Nylon R.I.P.""","Be ambivalent of the fact that these drumsticks are not only ""nylon dipped but nylon tipped"" as well. Now I have been beating the absolute @#%&$!? out of the drums for about 14 yrs. and have used a numerous variety of leading name brand nylon tipped sticks, such as: Ahead, Pro-Mark, Regal-Tip,Vater, Vic-Firth, etc. I've never seen something quite like this before...Most commonly, the tips will go before the stick, but in this case, within not even 5 days one of the two drumsticks broke toward the shoulder (or the neck/collar) of the stick."
2,Terrible durability,"The grips form blisters with regular use. Also, after 5 or 6 hours of jamming with the band, the stick I use to crash cymbals is already cracking. The bright side is. They are great feel. Very light and give the drums definition. I would only recommend these if you aren't on a budget. But if you're sponsored by sold Ian and get as many as you like. They're the best."
5,Great for Electronic Drums!,My teenager has broken many pairs of drumsticks on his electronic drum set! So far these have lasted and he loves them!
3,Disappointed - Mediocre Headphones,"I just received my pink Lowrider headphones in the mail today and was pretty excited. That excitement went right down the drain as soon as I put them on. I was expecting exceptional bass and sound and to be honest, that isn't what I got. These headphones were replacing some I bought from the Dollar Store (yes, you heard that right) and the ones from the Dollar Store had MORE bass than these. I feel like I have wasted my money. Although the sound is clear, it just isn't perfect and if these didn't cost 30 dollars (and I hadn't ordered them online) I would gladly switch back to my Dollar Store headphones. Even messing with the equilibrium settings on my iPod Classic didn't do much. If you're looking for exceptional bass quality, believe me, these AREN'T for you. I'd buy them for cheap but not for the price they're asking. It's just not worth it. AND, they keep falling off of my head and they're at the smallest width possible.At least they're cute."
2,Look better than they sound or feel,"I bought these at Staples along with a set of JBL Reference 410's. The JBL's were on sale for $40 (from $60). The Skullcandy's sound hollow and tinny and they felt cheap while wearing. For the money, the JBL's blew the Skullcandy's away. I've also used Koss Portasound 2's which are about $30 and sound/feel way better as well."
3,You can do better.,"They look cool, but the sound quality is just not there. Spend your money on the Sennheiser px100. For about the same price (or cheaper) you can have awesome sound reproduction. Trust me, the difference is very noticeable."
3,Love them but hate them...,I love the Skullcandy products. Sound quality is excellent. My only complaint is that these do not fit snug enough. They slip off all the time because of all the joints to make them fold. They just need to put a spring in them instead of the straight joint at the top and they should be okay. Also the rotating joint by the ear should have a little more tension. I feel like they're going to rattle apart. I have another pair of lowriders without the ability to fold and they are awesome!Skullcandy SC-LOW Lowrider Headphone (Red)
2,ok,"first off i dont know y every one says the cords are to short on the skullcandys there 4"" ? isnt that standard go buy and extention if u want to put ur mp3 in ur shoe or plug in to your sterio and run around ur room.ok sound quality nice and clear, confterable to wear, but hardly any bass at all if u want BASS i retured theres to best buy and got the skullcandy skullchrushers more expensive but there the best head phones i have ever hadSkullcandy Crushers"
2,There are much better options in headphones,"I seem to be on a headphone quest, owning at least nine of them by now and I bought this one strictly on impulse not realizing I think these headphones are meant for a younger person ( maybe teen ot pre-teen) who may not be as concerned with the sound quality as they are with the look. The phones do look cool but aside from that they are cheaply made and the sound quality is poor. The bass is easily distorted and experimenting with my Zen Vision's equalizer settings didn't help. I returned these phones for a refund and would not recommend them for critical listening.I am definetly not an expert in sound, or anything else for that matter but these headphones definetly look better then they sound. I hope this helps in making your purchase."
4,Pretty Good,"These headphones seem to have a good sound and are rather comfortable. If you have a large head you might want to flip them around (right to left). The swivel takes the pressure off the back of your ears, especially if you wear glasses. Nice look and the cord is a good length."
2,Meh,I bought these b/c I work in data entry and will go mad if I can't listen to something. The sound quality is good and they're comfortable enough but the longer I have them the worse the grip gets. I'm not saying I want a death squeeze on my head but if I lean back in my chair or sneeze the blasted things fly right off my head; walking around with them on at home is completely out of the question. So don't buy these if you want to move while wearing your phones
3,"Carolina Cradle, like New.","Like New was a little over the top. Although this product was in Great Shape, and no complaints due, it was not as new. There were some small checks on certain references in the book, and it had the binding bent to the side to a small degree. I bought it over others available on the site, because of its like new description. I just feel that it was a little optimistic."
1,Was this Data playing ???,"Before I begin my comment, it is worth noting that I am comparing a recorded piece of music to a piece I heard performed live.I was fairly excited to own my own copy of this music, after attending a piano concert where this was played. How disappointing.The musicians play this very mechanically. No emotion. And I don't know how one can't get emotional playing this piece. I got bored and turned it off. I could be jaded, having first-hand experience with this music, but I'm inclined to npt believe that.Another problem I have with this recording is some of the tonal depths. The piece, as an orchestral composition, has high treble notes and low, pouding bass sections, which aren't brought out in this performance. I don't know if the recording is poor, or the musicians purposefully quieted the rhythm and bass sections. Either way, it adds to the monotony of this attempt.Very very disappointing."
5,Stravinsky's masterpiece in black & white is awe-inspiring,"To hear ""Le Sacre"" in the rehearsal arrangement Stravinsky wrote for four-handed piano is truly enlightening. Stripped of its voluptuous orchestration, the genius of the composer's construction and creation can be tracked with greater precision, akin to seeing the blueprint for a Frank Lloyd Wright structure. It is not how we are meant to hear the piece, of course, but for those already enamored of the orchestral work, this is like a 'behind the scenes tour' of Stravinsky's genius. Highly recommended for those who don't mind hearing this monumental work in ""monochrome."""
4,CYCLING TO CRUISING!,"My friend and I purchased these bike March 20, they arrived March 23 and that was with the Super Free Shipping. I don't know the first thing about putting together a bike but I tried it. Oh, did I mention there were no instructions (just an owner's manuel)? I think I did pretty good for an amatuer. This bike was flawless straight out of the box. The rack and back fender already attached. Easy right? The ride is smooth like butter. My friend and I took them to our local bike shop to get kickstands and wider seats because we both have alot of junk in our trunks, so we need extra cushion for the pushin', but other than that I love our new bikes. Getting in shape for our cruise just got easier!"
3,Where's the suprise? Where's the suspense?,"Not bad, I guess. King's hype about using the serial formatto his advantage doesn't mesh with the reality. The endingsof each book might make you rush to buy the next one; but the""pay off"" in the subsequent book is a let down. This is agood series to buy if you travel by plane; a book for eachleg of your flight. But don't go looking for suprises orinteresting plot twists; there aren't many. Everything evolvespretty much the way you'd think it would. (Plus, threebucks for 90 pages is a bit much.)"
3,"Story line good, serial format terrible, overall cost excess","The story line in the first three of the series was good. I quit reading them until they all come out.I like to be able to finish a book when I start it.Also the totol cost is excessive. Approx $2.50 per 100 pages. That makes it $15.oo per complete novel for a paperback.If he does another, it will be the first King book I will have not read."
2,Academic book,"There are three sorts of history books, mostly pics, good reads, and droning academic texts. This one takes an interesting topic and makes you want to bang your head on the desk in boredom."
4,An important period in our American history,"Somewhere between the American Revolution and the Civil War there is a period of our country's history that is not as well known or recorded. The great era of the canals which for a number of years provided the most used transportation we knew is one of those periods. This book fills the gap by telling this story. From the great Erie Canal and all the songs that it inspired to the Blackstone Canal that ran from Providence to Worcester, Mass. making that inland city a ""port city"", the building of these great waterways is revealed. The growth of the railroads ended this colorful era but it need not be forgotten. Read this book and learn more about them."
5,I wanted my own copy,"When a friend of mine dropped a copy of ""The Last Chinese Chef "" off for me to read, she didn't make much of a comment, a wise decision in most cases; sometimes too big a build up in expectations can lead to disappointment. However in this case it wouldn't have mattered. I loved the book! It was a good story, well written, a window on a culture I know little about. I knew I wanted a copy of my own. Nicole Mones has taken her place on my list of favorite authors."
5,Unable to put this book down,"The story grabbed me from page one. It's one of the better books I've read in quite some time. Now I'm interested in learning more about China: its culture, its history, its food, and its people."
4,Enlightening,"While immersed in a love story, I learned a great deal about authentic Chinese cooking. I found it very interesting how mood and culture are so intertwined with food preparation as well as the list of very unusual ingredients."
3,eh,This is an easy read with delightful descriptions of Chinese culinary traditions. The plot is a little made-for-tv-movie-ish but if you are looking for something engaging and entertaining this is a good choice.
5,Compelling Novel About Chinese Cuisine Plus a Love Story,"Highly recommend this book where the author Nicole Mones (Lost in Translation) spins a compelling tale about a widowed food writer, her Chinese American - Jewish chef subject for an article, and the mysteries of haute Chinese Imperial cooking. Foodies like me will love this book with a studied treatment of the joys of genuine Chinese cooking. Others will enjoy the off beat love story set in an exotic locale. I particularly liked the portrait of the chef's extended Chinese family, and the way the story of the Cultural Revolution was woven into the understanding the present."
4,A sumptious feast,This book took me totaly by suprise. After reading the 1st paragraph I knew I was going to love it. I particulary enjoyed how much insight into to real chinese quisine and culture it provides. A tragic love story paired with a aspiring master chef wrapped in the dynamic chinese culture made for a captivating read.I believe this is the next best thing to going on a guided tour through china with a passionate local tour guide who can uncover many of the ancient secrets China has to offer.
5,BloG REVIEW AT COOKING WITH IDEAS,"I loved this. I don;t usually review just food fiction - when it is fiction it is usually a murder mystery and when it is not it is nonfiction on food OR a cookbook. So . . . this is a great read. For the full review at Cooking with Ideas, here's the url [...]"
3,"The food is interesting, the book is not","A completely predictable story - journalist goes to china to find out if her dead husband cheated on her. Any chance she'll fall in love with the bachelor subject of her latest story?The information about Chinese cuisine, history and cooking methods is very interesting, but not written up with that much skill. Compared with the Peter Mayle books on Province that had me lusting for every meal he describes, my eyes glazed over during many of the descriptions even though Chinese cuisine is among my favorite.I do have to say that in the description of one of the American Expat lawyers, his rationale for staying in China, this was the more realistic and authentic description of Ex-Pat life I've ever seen. I lived in Tokyo for three years."
2,It had a lot of potential,It could have been great but it just tried to do too much in such a small amount of time. The storyline had great potential but the characters needed more development for the reader to have feelings about them
3,3 stars for lack of depth with main characters.,"I thoroughly enjoyed the interplay of Sam's family and the rich history surrounding it. Unfortunately, the relationship between the 2 main characters was weak and predictable, in my view. I expected more."
3,Disappointing,"Disappointing, the problem with a novel that gets such rave reviews; I expected something monumental and I was merely entertained. It's too predictable. It bothers me, the decadence of the cuisine is astounding, killing 30 crabs for a sauce? It's criminal when parts of China, Asia, and Africa are staving, let our neighbors downstream/down current starve so we can win a contest that will further our career. Shallow. I expected more, not really a novel more a novella."
3,pleasant light read,"pleasant book, somewhat predictable, but enjoyable with a couple of subplots. If you're reading for entertainment this is a good read. It was interesting reading about Chinese culture on food and dining."
2,Read Mones' other 2 books first,"I enjoyed both ""Lost in Translation"" and ""Cup of Light"", but gave up on this book at p.94. I am surprised this is Mones' 3rd novel rather than her first. As some reviewers pointed out, the plot is predictable (as far as I got). All three novels share some common elements, but in the previous two the narrator was a more well developed, hence interesting character, and it was unclear how things would progress.On the other hand, if the writing in the first chapter does not bother you at all, you might like the whole book like so many of the readers."
2,I love 'food' writing.,This was an interesting history of Chinese cooking and Chinese Empires however I didn't enjoy the love story or even believe in it. I see on Amazon most people loved this book so I feel out of step but my main criticism is that I dont' feel it was well written. I couldn't get past that.
3,Fun book,Foodies and those interested in Chinese culture will love this book. Some of the dishes described are over the top!
3,Informative about Chinese Cuisine,It took me awhile to read this for several reasons. There were too many characters with names that I could not keep straight. They definitely were part of the the story but it was difficult to keep them straight. There was a lot of emphasis on the food prep.It was just okay.
4,i liked this book a lot,"The best part of this book for me was learning so much about Chinese culture. The plot was interesting, the characters definitely likable, and the conclusion satisfying. I loved the descriptions of the food, and the cities in China. For me, the setting in this story was alone worth reading it. I reccommend this book."
4,The Last Chinese Chef,I loved this book. It was very different. So much personal turmoil with a backdrop of Chinese Culture. Everyone around me was getting hungry. I would love to read some more books by the same author
4,Perfect for a food lover,The complexity of the descriptions of Chinese cooking could not match the plot. I hated the book to end and wanted to find a resturant that was able to prepare all the dishes.
3,Mouthwateringly Yummy,"Nicole Mones does a lovely job of stirring up a sizzling culture clash between East and West, and the fragile attraction she creates between Maggie McElroy and Sam Liang has film potential written all over it. Unfortunately, there are a couple of plot missteps about two thirds of the way through the story that may have been the product of some poor editing. There's no question, though, that Mones not only understands the nuances of Asian cuisine but can also write the descriptions of Sam's various dishes so accurately that you can practically smell the food off the page.Christina HamlettAuthor of ""Could It Be a Movie"""
3,"Nice book, but some ""distasteful"" language","I wanted to keep reading it, and am still trying (hopefully I can make it through - I love learning about Chinese cooking) but oddities like ""corn-fed"" girls from Ohio......what's that about? Seems misplaced in such a ""sophisticated"" book."
2,Broken cd cases,This producet arrived on time and was as stated on the website. It's cased wasn't cracked but other cds that I paid the full price for and were listed as new were cracked and the inside papers bent up and tore. Never again will I pay Amazon full price for a new cd. I could have bought a used copy and received the same thing. Horrible that I paid full price them cds came all tore up.
1,RECORDING & MIXING VOL. 1,"(Word to the wise) I bought this DVD package expecting great things but, was HIGHLY disappointed !!! I would DEFINITELY NOT recommend this video to anyone wanting to learn about what goes on in the recording studio. as it is a complete rip off !!! at best, It could be regarded as a vague overview of recording. but even THAT... is stretching it !!!"
4,VERY LARGE,"THIS IS WELL MADE BUT VERY LARGE. I THINK I CAN CUT IT DOWN TO FIT. I PUT IT ON MY 7LB DOG AND HE COULDN'T EVEN TAKE A STEP, THE FRONT WAS SO LONG HE WALKED ON IT. BUT THE MATERIAL IT'S MADE FROM SEEMS OF GOOD QUALITY. SO FOR THE PRICE I DON'T MIND TRYING TO FIX IT."
1,disgusting smell,"I bought this and it smells repulsing. so I left it outside overnight to see if it was just because of the way it was packaged or whatever, but nope. I then sprayed it in febreze and left it hanging up. but still nothing. so then I washed it in the washing machine and still the same smell. It smells so bad that there is no way I can put this on my dog. I have to throw it out because it is not worth the hassle of returning it :("
1,Too small,"I have a 2 years old Havanese, and this ""small"" raincoat does not fit him. At all.I mean the hood wont go over his head...the bottom doesn't cover his body all the way...and the rubber straps at the end of the raincoat broke off.Yes the product smelled like ""raincoat"" and I can see many people complaining about it, but it's not a big deal if you air it out on the little hanger it comes with.If you want to buy this raincoat, buy a size up."
2,Pet Rain Gear,"Happy with the product, but it took 3 months and 6 emails before I recived the shiped item. So I have not made up my mind if I will give this company another chance."
2,Really Big!,We ordered a small for our puppy and it was huge! I don't think he will ever be able to grow into it!
2,TOO BIG,"I have a 10Lb Maltese/Yorkie and this raincoat fits him a little to big. He keeps stepping on it as he goes outside for walks. Needless to say, he doesn't wear it. If you have a bigger dog, it would be the perfect size. Wish I would have purchased an XS, but he fits small/medium in every other type of dog clothing."
2,Just ok,"I got the XS after reading the reviews. It's big around, but too short down my 10lb min pin/chihuahua mix's back. She's tall and skinny. Also, after taking her out into a steady rain (not a downpour!), water leaks in around the seams of the pocket on the back. So, her Vibram fleece coat she was wearing under it got wet also. She HATES rain and hates to be wet, so I'm not too impressed with this coat. The quality is in line with the price I guess, but I really didn't think it would leak like that. Not blown away, quite frankly."
3,Reeks of moth balls!!!,"This little raincoat is adorable, fits my dog perfectly, and is firm, (so it won't blow up in windy weather,) BUT I just got it and it REEKS of moth balls!!! The smell is so bad, we had to put the box it came in outside. If I can't get the smell out of the raincoat I am going to return it. I've washed it twice and am letting it air dry but it still reeks. The smell is so strong that it's giving me a terrible headache!"
4,ok,Besides the sizing chart being very wrong and now I have a huge coat for my dog. It is really cute and serves its purpose. He does trip a little but he's not wet!
5,Excellent price for performance,"I initially purchased considerably more expensive speakers here on Amazon for our 1970's Cadillac. The ""JBL GTO328 3.5-Inch 2-Way Loudspeaker"" didn't fit the vehicle so I came back and ordered these Pyramid 3.5"" speakers. Right now these are the only speakers in the car. I expected a 1970's mono-type, crackling, low-end sound with just these little speakers up front but we are pleasantly surprised with the quality for the price. These are excellent front speakers and are... right now.. the only speakers in the car - powering hands-free bluetooth, music and GPS navigation with clarity. Very pleased with the purchase. No reason to detract a star ... considering the price. Thanks~!"
5,WOW!,"I had always heard that sonic maximizers really improved your sound, but had never experienced one. Seeing this one at such a good price I decided to try it with my Breedlove. I play through a Yamaha sound system and my tone was ok. After hooking this up all I can say is wow! It's basically like taking a blanket off your speakers. It really opens up your highs and lets your lows resound. Absolutely love this pedal and would definitely recommend it whether you have several pedals or none."
5,Great pedal at the end of your FX chain,This is a great pedal to put at the end of your FX chain. I have it as the last on my pedalboard before my GNX4. It's always on & it only took me about a week to settle on how I liked it adjusted. There are only two knobs & I just played around with them untill I was happy with the sound. I do a lot of recording & I also checked the sound after recording. Can't reccomend it enough especially considering the price.
5,"Big improvement to my sound, clear highs and deep bass","Big improvement to my sound, clear highs and deep bass. The Sonic Stomp adds clarity and depth to the signal. This product will push you sound up front, similar to a compressor. In theory, the sonic stomp works like compressor. While similar to a compressor, it encompasses a much broader range than most high end compressors."
1,Dubious Effect's Worst Incarnation,"I went through two of these before giving up. Both had noisy pots and I found the effect more trouble than it was worth.This is a very old and broadly-misunderstood effect that still stirs much controversy. I think it still may be of limited utility in certain studio mastering functions -- where it is best applied as a VST -- but it has little place with personal stage gear. It is generally reviled among more experienced musicians and especially by FOH sound techs, who find the effect disruptive to the house mix when used on individual instruments.In converting the chip to work on 9VDC, numerous compromises were made compared to the 120VAC rack units. According to BBE, the unit has less headroom than even the cheapest rack version, now discontinued.Pass on this."
3,computer moduled amps careful,"Ok. A friend of mine had an older crate amp. He connected this sonic stomp pedal to it. It made a hudge positive difference. It gave it a volume boost, clarified channel frequencies and all in all made it sound pretty damm descent. I went out and bought one. When I connected it to my computer moduled line 6 and peavey vyper amps they had no effect. NONE at all.IMPORTANT CONCLUSION: if you have an older non computer modeled amp ( DOES NOTcome with a drastic amount of effects electronically produced by an built in electronic computer processor) it WILL make a drastic bad a$# difference. If you have a newer or computer processed based amp it will NOT do anything.Jdhisto"
1,Unusable ... for me,"I was expecting more, because I really like BBE products, but this one is a disappointment. Basically, when I used the low process knob, it did help my sound, slightly, but when I engaged the high contour, it added nothing but extra hiss. It might work for a bass player but for me ... no thanks.My rig telecaster > pw tuner > mxr super comp > bbe soul vibe > bbe green screamer > proco ydr > Boss AW-3 > combo with reverb"
4,Hmmmm... Soothing,"The first 1/3 of the movie seemed unbearably slow to me. I almost quit. However, the momentum picked up afterwards. And then I was glad that I held on to it. Over all this movie is poetic and healing. Beautiful ending. It is worthy to be patient when you watch this movie."
3,Fraser makes us swoon again!,"A heart-warming love story about a quirky guy (Brendan Fraser)who plays a trumpet-playing, puppeteer who is sure he is in love with a seemingly hard-to-please, gold-digging snob(Joanna Going). Fraser has visions of his one true love and sets out to find her in this romantic comedy. A must-see for all Fraser fans."
4,Romantic movie,"This is one of my favorite Brendan Fraser movies. It's about finding your true love and not being afraid to take the chance to fall in love. Brendan's acting is so natural, you forget that's not who he really is. Joanna Going does an excellent job of the cynical woman of Brendan's vision, who is at first afraid to love and be loved. This is not an action adventure movie or comedy like some of his others. The scenes are more sensual. If you like to see the softer side of Brendan Fraser, get this movie!!"
5,Wake up Call,"I always thought Brendan Fraser was cool. He has great acting talent, VERY expressive facial expressions, and boyish guy-next-door looks. When I viewed this particular movie, however, I was blown away by the depths of which his talent moves you. It really made me stand up and notice his talent on a much larger scale. The movie, itself, has the challenges of a love story, but the peculiarities of the main character's life compels you to keep watching. It is full of so many surprises, you don't know what to expect next! Great viewing for those who are keen on sentimental meanings and tradition in their families."
5,Still Breathing,"This music, in all its variety and beauty, spins a dream and weaves a web of emotion just as the movie did . . . Rarely has music been such an integral part of a love story--not mere background or commentary, but a part of the story and the characters. For example, when Roz makes her ""leap of faith,"" her decision is internal and about faith and feeling and hope, and thus cannot be expressed in words--it is shown in music--and that music is one of the loveliest and most moving passages I've ever heard. When music is this magical and expressive, words will not do. You must hear this."
5,TWO OF A PAIR NECESSARY TO TOP OFF THE SERIES,"Hare + Guu: Deluxe OVA, Vol. 2THIS TOPS OFF THE TICKLE BONE HUMOR AND DEEP STORY OF THE BOX SET AND FIRST OVA. IT IS SIMPLY A MUST HAVE DVD, IF YOU HAVE THE OTHERS. THE SERIES OF SO FUNNY AND SO SERIOUS THAT I WAS REALLY AMAZED AT THE WHOLE PRODUCTION. ENJOY"
3,GOOD SAW BUT NEEDS HELP,"ALTHOUGH I FIND THE SAW TO BE AN EXCELLENT VALUE, THE 52"" HOMESHOP EXACTA FENCE LEAVES MUCH TO BE DESIRED. PACKAGING IS MARGINAL AT BEST, AND THE GUIDE RAIL ARRIVED SCRATCHED. THE MELAMINE TABLE ARRIVED DAMAGED AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR MOUNTING THE FENCE ARE WRONG, AND IF FOLLOWED EXACTLY THE FENCE CANNOT BE LEVELED. A CALL TO JET TECH SERVICE REVEALED THAT THEIR PEOPLE ARE POORLY TRAINED AND A RECOMMENDATION THAT WAS CLEARLY WRONG WAS GIVEN TO ME. I WAS LEFT TO MY OWN DEVICES TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM. THE PRESSURE SENSITIVE NYLON PADS ON THE FRICTION POINTS OF THE FENCE DO NOT ADHERE WELL. THEY ARE A POOR WAY TO DO THE JOB ON A SAW COSTING THIS MUCH. THEY CAUSE THE FENCE TO CREEP AND LOSE ALL ACCURACY. I PROBABLY WILL NOT BUY ANOTHER JET TOOL UNTIL I AM CONVINCED THAT JET IS SERIOUS ABOUT ENGINEERING A QUALITY PRODUCT."
5,A Real Fine Machine,"Moved up from [$$$]Craftsman table saw. The old saw was a toy compared to this machine. This thing is a real solid machine...I hope I'm worthy of its abilities. Found the instructions to be very good, except the separate instructions on the extension table and fence as they were dreadful. Also, when you transition from the main instructions to the fence/extension table instructions it is difficult to follow and determine when and where to return in the instruction sequence.I suggest you buy the mobile base when you purchase it. I don't plan to move mine much, but I wouldn't want to have to move this thing an inch without one. It seems like it would be easiest to assemble right on the stand like I did.Now that is together, it is a powerhouse!!! I look forward to using it for years to come."
2,A disappointing book,"A bought this book before reading the review below, mislead by the title. What I found out was in half the book a brief descrption of metrics with recommendations on what to do with them and in the other half, some generic statements about concepts as customer life value, interviews, lineal regression and ROI. This book is intended as a recipe book for call centers management but it falls too much short. If you need to learn more about CC, then read ""Call centers on fast forward"". It's a more comprehensive treatment on them."
1,Wrong photo,"The photo portrays a short 16.25 oz glass. The ones I just received were 2.5 inches wide and 6.5 inches tall.(Hi-ball glasses) They look nice but I didn't need anymore tall glasses.Oh yes, you can get them at Bed Bath and Beyond for $11.99. I should have shopped around."
5,Purchase was great experience,"I remodeled bathroom in my house and wanted to buy Moen products. I couldn't decide between two models, so I bought both and had them shipped. After selecting one, I returned the other, with NO PROBLEMS. What a pleasure to buy in this way. I would normally only buy products like this locally, because of potential return policy and process. But this experience has changed my mind. Amazon was great."
3,"trim kit is lovely, but challenging to install","Great appearance and quality. I purchased this trim kit to allow our custom shower heads to operate one-at-a-time. I have a handheld shower, 2 body sprays, and a rainforest drip showerhead. The trim kit is supposed to allow the user to use one device at a time. The unit mostly works, but the showerheads not in use continue to drip when the handheld shower is operating. Small irritation, but tolerable."
2,too expensive for design,"the installation instructions are really bad.the design - the bottom lever needs to be pulled to start water flow - is not that convenient, and the fact that it operates that way was not clear from the product description."
3,Confused,"While I think this was an excellent value, I was disappointed because the trim kit lacked instructions and all of the necessary screws to install. I did not spend the time to contact seller about issue. I instead searched internet for instructions and purchased screws locally."
4,An excellent first novel.,"As I have shared with the author personally, the pace gets extremely fast near the end. However, the characters are engaging and the author nails small town life in the South quite well. I look forward to reading the next book and further character development.All in all, a very solid first effort for this author."
5,Cool Copy Paper,It is a copy paper that catches your eye. It has little flecks of color throughout the paper and anything you print on it really sets it off. It is great for making up fliers and poster type stuff or just for around the house type printing. Thanks Amazon.com for bringing me another cool product.
5,lens cleaner,this stuff works great on my camera lens and filters. I had bought some filters for my camera on ebay they came with some kind of oil or something on it and was hard to get off. this cleaner took it off and cleaned filters up great will buy again worth the money shipped and rec on time.
5,Works on critical optics,"I use this, applied with CleanTip applicators, on my microscope optics. That combination leaves no residue and is lint free under 100x magnification inspection of the resulting surface. Brushing, blowing, and lens wipes all leave some lint. Thats ok for most exterior optics but not something to leave inside an instrument."
5,See Clearly,Nicely sized bottle gives good quantity of product for daily cleaning of eyeglasses. Streakless results lets the user see clearly.
1,Um..check B and H,"I just bought this same stuff from B&H for $2.99 a bottle. Go to their site and check it out. I bought ten bottles, shipping was 5.50. So for the price of 3 and half bottles here I bought ten from B&H."
2,sadly disappointed,Had great reviews and I just don't get it ! It seems to just smear grease around and a lot of work in my opinion. Expensive and a dry majik cloth worked so much better for me.
4,"Nice lens cleaner, but difficult to limit amount of spray","This lens cleaner seems to work pretty well, but it's difficult to limit the amount of spray. Sometimes the amount of spray seems a bit too much."
3,"Too many critics, not enough Free","I have just sat through this DVD and was left with mixed impressions. The idea behind this concept is sound: review the legacy of one of the world's most seminal bands, have some clips and sprinkle in some interviews from contemporaries / ex band members / roadies / associates. Unfortunately, we are given much talk / opinion from musos and experts not even connected with the band. George Bush could have fitted in his opinion on this disc and not been out of place.On the plus side, the guitar tutorials are a great idea, but this could have been extended to showing aspects of lead breaks / bass runs etc. The live film clips were good but why not feature entire songs instead of excerpts? There is a heap of bootleg footage around... why not use it and cut out the pirates and keep the fans happy?"
1,Not as big as I thought it should be for the size,Shirt was not the same length as the other 14-16 size shirts of this type that my granddaughter has. Somewhat shorter and doesn't stay tucked in as she would like.
4,Excellent full featured firewall for a reasonable price,I have used SonicWall's various firewall products ever since their first SOHO firewall in both home and business settings. The TZ170 is an excellent firewall with very flexible settings and offers both software and box-to-box IPSec VPN capability. It DOES work with other firewall products including Cisco but interoperability can be spotty or require some knowledgeable setup.Sonicwall's are not the best choice for the general consumer as they offer too many advanced settings that someone with firewall experience will need to configure to get full use of the product. If you are an IT professional you will enjoy the features and capabilities of the various products.I have had SonicWalls run 24/7 for years with no problems but have also had a few lemon units. In general they are sensitive to heat and should be kept as cool as possible. Definitely do not stick them in a closet with a bunch of stuff stacked on top.
5,"Soft, Elegant and Affordable!","What convinced me to buy this product was the price and the other person's review. All I can say is that they were absolutely right - it's sooo soft, easy to wash and dry, and looks so elegant from either side (one side is smooth like a microfiber sheet and the other side is more like a microfiber blanket). I got the sage but am considering getting the oyster color, too!"
3,seattle funk,"this is one of those ol skool cd's i pop in cause i feel like hearing that old westcoast sound. its good, i like about 4 or 5 songs on here especially 72 on the grind and the last song yo flow he should have ripped that one, maybe i will one day hell of a beat."
4,Replacement Starter Solenoid for Simplicity # 1685290 1685291 168698...,"It works great, however the two top posts are aligned perpendicular to the posts on the original solenoid. It would have been helpful to have instructions explaining that either wire can be hooked to either post - it does not make a difference electrically. It took a while to research the point with an electrical engineer I know."
4,Probably not a replacement for Simplicity #1685290,"The original starter solenoid with Simplicity part #1685290 is NOT grounded through the base. Either the description for this part is wrong, or this part will damage your mower. Contact the seller before you purchase!You need to be careful when replacing the starter solenoid. Most auto solenoids are grounded through the base and can not be used.To test if your existing solenoid is grounded through the base, use a multimeter set to resistance (Ohms) and touch the base and each of the smaller posts. If either post gives you a reading of 0 (or close to 0), it is grounded through the base."
1,Had to throw it out.,"I'm a fan of Japanese candies and snacks but this gum I would not recommend. It tastes like children's grape ""flavored"" cough medicine. I had to throw the entire pack out because people whom I shared it with had the same reaction. Try another flavor."
4,"Good, but...","I bought several copies of this book (one for myself and some for some friends) after reading some excerpts from a friend's copy. I thought the information on the wedding rituals was quite useful but you must bear in mind that there are also regional differences. I believe almost everything that Gong describes is from the Cantonese perspective so some things just don't apply to non-Cantonese. I also thought that it could get confusing for non-Chinese ppl b/c sometimes she uses the Mandarin word, sometimes the Cantonese, and sometimes both. For the most part, this book has interesting information but I'm not crazy about the style of the writing."
5,The Butcher's Wife,"The Butcher's Wife by Li Ang is a shocking story about the life that one woman had to live. She was constantly abused and degraded by her husband. This book gives a sense of reality into how bad sexual oppression really is. It describes vividly the horror this woman went through and how she decided to take charge. This book will keep you reading for it describes thoroughly this one woman's conquest to overcome her biggest fear, the fear of her own husband."
2,I'm Afraid of Books like this!,"The premise of this book is a good one, don't get me wrong there. It had possibilities. Unfortunately, it fell flat far from these. It didn't promise all seemed. Basically it tells you why you should be afraid of certain things...but there is no new information, nothing exciting, and the things to be afraid of, frankly, are stupid. It is boring in its presentation. It was that book that could've but didn't."
3,Not as interesting as it should be....,"I heard a radio interview with the author on my way to work one morning and decided to buy the book. I was hoping to find out things that were dangerous that I was unaware of. However, out of all 448 things, the only ""new"" thing I learned was that bug zappers are bad because they throw bacteria into the air when they kill the bug."
3,Grammar,"i liked the plot, especially how arthur lost his memory and the anticipation for him to rememberbut, i have found a typing mistake, where author instead of Suzy wrote Leaf...to be honest i didnt like it at all, i mean its not a school essay, to make typing mistakes..i have found flows in the drowned wednesday as well, when Raised Rats never asked their third question, maybe its gonna happened in the later books, but at the moment i feel very dissapointed that the author is not carefull enough in his writing."
5,Very nice. Very handy.,"Others have written, ""why didn't I get this a long time ago?"" Same here. Just as described. Solid, yet not heavy. And 6-feet is just right for multiple things that a stool won't let you reach."
5,works like a charm and saves me much time.,works like a charm and saves me much time.works like a charm and saves me much time.works like a charm and saves me much time.
4,as expected,I expect this ladder to last 20 years with normal home use. The 300 lbs rated products should handle some abuse but I am gentle on my equipment. It arrived with no defects. I since learned I could purchase a similar item at lower cost nearby otherwise I would give it 5 stars.
1,Where's the paint shelf?,"I received my ladder today and it looks terrific, but... for $116.00, where's the paint shelf? I can't believe that such a well made ladder doesn't come with a paint shelf and I'm kicking myself for not noticing that when making my purchase. To add one, I had to go right to Louisville Ladder and shell out another $31.00 (cost plus shipping) for what would likely have cost the company mere dollars to have included as a standard feature on the ladder. Honestly, and as originally noted, the ladder looks great and I'm sure that it will serve me well, but I feel absolutely ripped off that this high priced, quality item does not include a paint shelf as a standard feature. At the very least, one should be offered as an accessory at a reasonable price on the Amazon site."
5,Good 8 Footer,Real nice ladder that takes my 300 lbs without a groan. It feels sturdy and solid on the ground. Moving it around is easily manageable and the clips to hold the legs in place was a nice touch. The slots in the top of the ladder are convenient for holding tools and a light bulb.
5,Louisville Fiberglass Ladder,"This fiberglass ladder is solid and high quality and does not conduct electricity like an aluminum one would. It was priced $8.00 more than a comparable Werner aluminum ladder at Lowe's. I believed the degree of safety of a fiberglass ladder over an aluminum one was well worth the difference in price.I checked the price of a Werner fiberglass ladder in this size and found it to be over $20.00 more expensive. Furthermore, it did not appeal to me since it allowed access from either side of the ladder and had no top shelf to place paint, tools, or other small items.The warranty of the Louisville ladder was 90 days rather than the 1 year period of a Werner ladder. This did not bother me since ladders are not what I would consider a ""wear item"". It seemed to me that any defect would suddenly occur within the first 90 days as opposed to the next 9 months following its purchase."
4,"Good, sturdy ladder","This is a very sturdy, well-made ladder. It has lots of tool slots and a magnet area for screws and nails on the top. I would have given it five stars, but I ordered the pail shelf direct from the manufacturer ($18.00 plus shipping ) and I found the instructions to be a little confusing and the pre-drilled holes in the ladder were a little off, making it necessary to get out the power drill."
5,Perfect Ladder,A strong fiberglass ladder at a great price! The top has a nice tool and material holding surface with a large magnet and slots and holes to help hold material while working on the ladder!
5,Louisville Ladder is great.,This ladder is much more stable than the more common big box store ladders. I almost exceed the weight limit and yet I feel secure. There are several unique features such as grooves for cutting pipe.
3,Okay.,We saved some money by not purchasing a 'new' ladder - part of the top part was broken and so using the ladder has become quite a chore.
3,2nd Time Is Okay,"The first ladder I ordered was never delivered and was 'lost in transit' according to my discussion with Amazon yesterday. The customer service rep said they would send me a new one overnight and by golly, they did.The I honestly don't know if I'm going to keep it because the ladder is rickety because the feet aren't even. The ladder was also a bit battered, scratched and dirty in places because it wasn't wrapped. The feet at the bottom of this ladder are made out of plastic and do not look sturdy. I'm honestly thinking of returning it because it the rickety factor. I am not happy about this ladder."
3,Get the book The Peace Maker instead,"This is a leader's guide that has goes along with a DVD(not included). You can find the DVD at the publisher directly. If you are a leader and want to prepare to lead a class, this book does not prepare you as well as the original book The PeaceMaker, which I would give 5 stars. This book has far less peace making material, and much of it focuses on what to do during class time itself."
4,They're like Doritos: you can't read just one,"It seems impossible to me to review any *one* book of this series. All the ones I've read so far -- this was the latest -- have been more or less interchangeable. Sharpe fights huge battles. Sharpe deals with army politics. Sharpe sleeps with gorgeous woman X, Y, or Z. Sergeant Harper wastes a bunch of Frenchies. However, don't take that as a criticism. These books are great. They're wildly entertaining and Cornwell seems to have a very good grasp on the events, tactics and battlefield realities of the Napoleonic Wars. In each installment, our heroes survive hairsbreadth escapes, the reader learns a little more early 19th century Continental military trivia, and battle scenes both thrilling and gory abound. What more could anyone want? They're not great literature, but they sure are entertaining."
2,Time to let go!,"P.A.R.C. Boys huh? I liked SweetWater a whole lot better. This album is flat. Adam the front man was born to be a rock star and I sincerely hope he succeeds but the chemistry between these four lads is gone. Also, the name has got to go as well."
2,Where have you gone Sweetwater?,"I look fondly back to the days where this band (formerly Sweetwater) found a way to communicate with a hard edge guitar and riveting vocals. Now, they languish on as a high-school garage band. I take no solace in this review since Sweetwater was truly one of my favorite bands. This album was a dissapointment, don't be fooled."
5,"Play this Amazing Record Continuously, BOYS (and girls)!","You'll never get tired of it! I am appalled that Seattle Radio has managed to let the success of this album go unacknowledged. Their loss. Regardless of air-play PARC Boys are obviously getting heard. ""I Got (plenty of) People"" who are clammoring for more! Congratulations to the band and Will Records for putting out such a great Rock Album!"
1,2nd of 2 CDs in Leadbelly Golden Classics series,"(24') Taken from 78s, this is a fine selection of Lead Belly guitar/vocal solos, but with generally quite poor sound. Four of the ten tracks given here are duplicated on either ""Vols. 1 & 2"" COL5603 (52') or ""Vols. 3 & 4"" COL5604 (54') of Collectables' ""Lead Belly Memorial"" 2-CD series, which is a much better buy; the other six are unique on Collectables CDs. All of the ""Memorial"" tracks were originally recorded by Moses Asch in his studio, and his pressings went to Stinson Records as a result of Asch's Folkways bankruptcy; however, Asch's masters are now at the Smithsonian, which has produced its own ""Lead Belly Legacy"" series of CDs. The 6 unique tracks on this CD appear not to be Asch recordings, but I haven't tried to verify this."
4,NEVER TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER,"""She will be dead soon."" Fifteen years after that awful pronouncement, Sue Buchanan is lecturing, running her successful corporation and reminding all breast cancer patients that we are NOT victims. Stand up for your rights, stand up and do the unexpected, stand up and laugh out loud. Her honest story of her battle with breast cancer and some of the doctors she met along the way is a quick, enjoyable read. Her continued joie de vie and encouragement for all women is delightful. A good book when you are down in the dumps - it's enough to shake you out of the doldrums and into some action!"
5,Best of the bunch...give it to a friend.,"I prefer the original title: Love, Laughter and a High Disregard for Statistics. When I was diagnosed with breast cancer 5 years ago, friends and family (with the best intentions) felt compelled to send me books by survivors of the disease. Some of them were interesting, others downright depressing, but this one really lifted my spirits and helped me to cope. Well written -- a fun read -- I still have it and frequently share it with other women as they face the challenges of cancer. Sue Buchanan, you sure made a difference in this woman's life. Mahalo nui loa!"
5,High quality large cabinet knob,"This is a great quality knob. It is larger than expected but looks great insatlled. I put knobs on my kitchen cabinet doors and matching pulls on my kitchen drawers. However, the 3 inch pulls are too small to go with this knob. I had to use 6 inch pull and they look great together."
3,Needs to be a little more durable,"Love the concept. Great keeping sweat and dirt from the gym or moutain biking off the upholstery, though if you have to sit too long, lack of breathability will cause you to start sweating while you drive. 2 of the 4 of these I've purchased had the end caps pop off and get lost whether from being on the floor on rolling up to quickly, so some glue on the end caps is a definite recommendation."
3,Mixed Feelings!,"I have mixed feelings about this item. I have been using American Harvest jet stream oven for more than a decade. I love what convection oven cooking does and got rid of a microwave oven. I do, however, have to comments of the imperfections of the design. The lid is the weakest part of the design; it is very fragile and tends to crack easily. In the time that I have been using this oven, I had to change the lid at least 4 times. Also, the price tag for a basic piece of plastic seems too high. Well, with all that said, I still bought it to be able to continue using the oven. I wish more manufacturers made convection ovens. They are a healthy choice for cooking."
4,"Just the facts, please","But not with Alexander I. He is too complex.Books on him fall into two categories, those who present the hard facts and those who are apologists. Apologists explain this complex man as one whose bizzare behavior is due to Imerial ""dissimulation"" or other mitigating factors.Both sorts of books are needed, fun, fair, and keep things interesting. Authors with fine credentials are in both schools.This is a nicely done book with a 1964 copyright. Maybe the apologists fuel the interest in this fascinating man. Upon completion, they leave one on more of an upper with a desire to learn more.This bok is worth locating."
2,"Does not fit 15"" MacBook Pro laptops","This laptop case does not fit either the original or the 2nd generation 15"" MacBook Pro laptop. It just misses it by about 1/2 an inch, but that is too much of a lack of dimensions to even wedge one in there. Likely will work just fine for PC laptops."
4,Great Saw - Some assembly issues,"The machine itself is great. No vibration, passes the nickle test. Very easy to true-in. Woulda been 5 stars except for the assembly. Switching between saw and fence instructions was a pain, but nothing common sense couldn't handle. Earlier issue with flat head screws covered in one page addendum to manual. Major problem...the three holes along the right side of the table, where you mount the cast iron wing, weren't tapped all the way through, 50% at best. Three 10mm holes through cast iron were a hassle to hand tap. Call to helpline reached a real person that transferred me to a technicain. I was on hold for less than 2 minutes. Tapping was irritating, but once set up...a great saw. Buy it."
5,One Great Saw,"Delivery - was a major concern since I knew the weight was well over 120 lbs - but was delivered by FedEx with a lift truck and dropped in the garage. No hassles there. All for under $5.00Packaging - Saw base is delivered on a pallet - the fence in packaged in a separate contaner. The fence package arrived damaged with missing parts. Fed Ex noted damage on the delivery ticket (a must) and Amazon was able to verify that this damage existed upon delivery (took them less than a minute). Jet sent me another complete fence in 3 days.Assembly - I knew going in the instructions were on the light side - so I read all of the instructions 2 or 3 times before diving in. No real problems - again the fence instructions were poor but almost anyone should be able to figure out which screws to use where - you only have 3 different sizes.Saw runs great - no vibration, quiet. Do get a separate circuit installed."
2,Warning ! ! ! ! ! Beware ! ! ! ! !,"Reviewer: R. Comeaux from Buford, Ga USA Was Dead ON. Xacta Fence is gernic add-on. Does not fit saw. Takes a great deal of reworking......:( and parts from local hardware. Jet should not sell this combo, until they get their shi@t together. Would not recommend this combo to a newbie. Directions start out by ""DRILL OUT RAIL MOUNT THREADS ON CAST IRON TOP"" Made me sick...."
2,"Looking Backward, Going Nowhere Fast","I, too became tired of Cornwell after The Last Precinct and then was completely captivated by the Jack the Ripper story. That she could make that tale so compelling, renewed my respect for Cornwell's writing. But, Blow Fly is even more tiresome than the Last Precinct. Not only do we spend two-thirds of the book reintroducing characters from the past--but we bring back the dead. I was hoping for something fresh and compelling, but I got something warmed over one too many times."
3,Far from her best effort,"The last Scarpetta installment is a weird one. Use of third person in discribing events gets old too quickly and really does not do much for the plot.Speaking of the plot, the reintroduction of Benton was so flat and lifeless that you'd think he just came back from the short holiday! Also, the ending is pretty lame.Having said that, Patricia Cornwell is still one of the masters and I sincerely do hope that, after the awkwardness of trying to tie up so many lose ends in a jiffy, the next Scarpetta novel is on the level we all come to expect."
1,benton is a stiff dead or alive & enough animal torture,"i have just finished blow fly.....in the audio version....it seemed as though it was a cast of characters looking for a story....i guess everyone is going to relocate...but is that enough for a novel?...benton is the most self absorbed,pompous cold fish i have ever heard of....i almost rejoiced when his face was in the jar in that fridge......and to ms cornwell...please enough with the animal torture...cute dogs drowned in pools...helpless horses burned to death....poor pound dogs used as alligator bait...good grief...a mystery is supposed to be a thrill ride not a depressing dose of reality....i am a pet owner and have owned rescue dogs....the mention of the caged dogs at the end of blow fly was distracting...i was hoping that i would not be treated to a discription of more animal horrors......i still am a fan....hope the next one is back on track.."
3,Forget Talley...,"From what I remember, Jay Talley's hair was dark when Kay Scarpetta met him in Black Notice (""Sunlight polished his hair like ebony...""). Here he is blond. What happened? If I, as a reader, remember this, how is it possible for the author to be confused about it? It may be considered a small detail, but... He was also very sophisticated. What accounts for the change? Who he really is? Does he have to be so grotesque and creepy? I don't particularly care for all the gory details of his ""adventures"".The end is the best part of this book, and it is well paced, clear (contrary to what some have said), and satisfying."
1,Menopause Meltdown?,"I don't know if Patricia Cornwell is going through ""the change"", losing her marbles, or if she's been abducted by aliens, but this is not the Scarpetta that captivated me for so many years. I actually had to put this book down and take some aspirin. No more anticipating the next Scarpetta , another one of life's little pleasures is gone. Judging by the reviews I've read, I am not alone."
1,Very Disappointed,"I have read the entire series of Dr. Kay Scarpetta and would always get so excited when a new book came out in the series. However, this is the first time I was strongly disappointed in one of the books. I felt Cornwell was all over the place with her characters, which made it difficult to become involved with any of the characters with any depth. Each chapter went from one character to another but never deep enough to feel connected or interested in any of the characters. In fact, there was less about Dr. Scarpetta in this book and she has always been the main character. This was a true disappointment for me."
1,They keep getting worse,"I think Patricia Cornwell is trying to see how badly she can write and still sell novels. Her past few novels have been just incredible--the characters aren't believable any more, the story lines aren't wrapped up properly, and the material is just plain depressing. In this one the formerly righteous crime fighters turn into murderers, and all of the characters act like wimps who don't know right from wrong. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."
1,Dumbfounded,"This was an awful book. If it had been written by anyone other than Patricia Cornwell it never would have made it into print. How on earth did a blind guy escape from prison? What wasn't implausible was silly. Because Amazaone is a bookseller it won't do this, but there should be a Do Not Buy warning option."
1,What a crock!,"I was so disappointed with this book that I am disgusted that I spent hours reading it. The plot was confusing and the ""resurrection of the dead"" (I'm trying not to give away an surprise) was so unbelievable. I really liked many previous Kay Scarpetta books, but this one was so contrived and unsatisfying that I may not bother to read any more."
1,Enough already!,"I read most of Patricia Cornwell books and liked them however they seem to get worse and more unbelivable every year. This one takes the cake. SPOILER!Two years and not a peep from Benton Wesley. Wait...Yeah, Benton Wesley is not dead, he is just undercover! Okaay. Geez, I think we all know Dr Scarpetta could keep a secret. Then we have this international conspiracy which is seriously laughable. Then, there is the martyr and the victim of every law inforcement agency-Scarpetta's niece, Lucy. I'm tired of hearing how everybody is out to get her because she is gourgeous talented lesbian. Please, kill me.."
1,Sad day for Scarpetta,"Having loved all of the other Scarpetta books, I read Blow Fly with a sense of anticipation. Unfortunately, this wasn't met at all. The book lacks the mystery of the preceeding volumes. All of the characters seemed manipulated towards the ending, which wasn't nearly so obvious in the other books. I was disappointed with the third person perspective, although I understand while it was used. However, Cornwell calling Kay ""Scarpetta"" throughout the book seemed to distance her from the character. If she was calling the main character of her story by last name, she should have kept it consistent throughout. Overall, the story seemed tired and not very imaginative. Hopefully the sequel (whenever it comes out) will be better than this uninspired novel."
1,Why did I waste my time?,"I've stayed away from this series for a few years but chanced on the Blow Fly and thought I'd give it another chance. Why ever did I even attempt it? I've missed a few in the series, having given them up a few years ago, but nothing has changed. Apparently Kay S is as misunderstood but perfect as ever. How a totally self-centered and egotistical character could gain a following is beyond me.Her fan club of dysfunctional people continues to swarm round. Every one of the characters in the book is as demented as the criminals in the story. And almost nothing happens in the book except her niece becomes a cold-blooded murderer but no one seems to think this an inappropriate way to act.I'm now hoping Kay goes on the hunt for a terrorist and all her friends and associates somehow are blown to bits as a final installment. I could go on with the many reasons why this book was such a waste, but the book simply doesn't deserve that kind of time."
2,"Maybe if we quit buying, she'll go back to writing good books!","I have read every one of Patricia Cornwell's books, and I really enjoyed the forensics and thought the writing was excellent and the mysteries were interesting. I was very angry when she killed off Benton Wesley and swore I'd never read another. I should have stuck to my guns, but when you're in an airport and need something to read right now......I mean, how bad could it be? Well, it was boring, it was depressing, and the BIG SURPRISE was an insult to my intelligence. I don't believe it for one second, not one. Nope. Can't happen, didn't happen, I don't care how much Patricia thinks her readers want it. She needs to go back to the basics that made her books so wonderful. I for one am sick to death of all the melodrama, all the outrageous coincidences, and all the depressing helplessness of a woman who was so appealing to us once, because she was so capable and had so much common sense."
4,A nice follow-on to the Wolfman saga,I thoroughly enjoyed this book as it tied all of the characters together. I am glad that I didn't let the negative reviews keep me from reading it. It's not heavy into the forensics as the past novels were but I didn't really miss it because I got wrapped up in the human aspect of the characters. Do yourself a favor and read it. I am looking forward to reading the next Scapetta novel.
4,"What does ""Blow Fly"" mean?","In regards to a previous review, the title ""Blow Fly"" is a metaphor for the Chandonne family. A blow fly feeds off of the rotting flesh of dead bodies--here refering to the murderers, Jean-Baptiste, Jay Talley and Bev Kiffen.This isn't the best Scarpetta novel, but it is worth reading. If you are new to Cornwell, start at the beginning with ""Postmortem"" and read in chronological order. It is a lot of books, but they can be read in a few hours each. Skip the ones that are not about Scarpetta--they introduce a new character who really is not very interesting.After a 3 year hiatus from Scarpetta, this book reintroduces each character in detail, leaving not much room for plot development. The best part of the book is at the end, something I waited for for 6 years. I won't give it away, but it should give this series of characters a new breath of life. I can't wait for the continuation of this book!"
1,Hopelessly inept,"The latest Cornwell is an embarrassment to book lovers. Annoying style, questionable characterization, ludicrous plotting. She should give it up to avoid further embarrassmemt. No stars out of five."
2,Jumbled and disjointed,"I had several people recommend this book to me. I wish now that I had not trusted them, but at least I didn't buy it in hardcover.In every other series I've ever read the author managed to have each book stand alone, so I wasn't too worried that I hadn't read any of the other books in the series. Bad idea on my part! Maybe if I'd known more about the characters I could have understood what the heck they were doing. As it was, this book was nothing more than a jumble of disjointed scenes. And those scenes don't even flow smoothly together. It puts me in mind of someone trying to put together a beautiful picture by taking a handful of pieces from about 5 or 6 different puzzles. None of the pieces fit together so its nothing more than a jumbled mess.So, ask me if I want to bother reading any of the other books in the series after reading this one? No, thank you. I at least like all my puzzle pieces to fit smoothly together even if the whole picture isn't going to make any sense."
1,A Disappointment,I was very disappointed by the story line. This was not up to the usual standard of the previous Kay Scarpetta novels that were created. It seems the author is lacking ideas to continue the trials of Dr. Scarpetta.
2,BIG disappointment for Cornwell/Scarpetta fans,"I've read all of Patricia Cornwell's Scarpetta novels, and both the Andy Brazil books and loved them all.Eagerly, I bought Blow Fly and started in. I wasn't sure if time had just taken it's toll on my reading desires, or if the book was truly as disappointing as I found it. It was the latter.Like other reviewers, I felt the book seemed to jump around with very little flow and there was VERY little of the forensic aspect that attracted so many to Scarpetta in the first place.The plots have become so far-fetched and ridiculous it's tough to enjoy the book with a straight face.The book also ends in a way that leaves the reader KNOWING there will be an equally-bad follow up.If Patricia Cornwell is unable to continue the Scarpetta stories with the intelligence, wit and drama we've all grown accustomed to, it's time to retire the character and start with something fresh and (hopefully) better."
2,"Starts with a roar, ends with a whimper...","I became addicted to the Scarpetta series and devoured every one. Sad to say, this one gave me bit of indigestion. Ms. Cornwell, what have you done to our beloved characters? Marino was always an out of shape slob, but we knew he was the best at what he did. In this book, we only got the slob. And Lucy! There was finally a strong, beautiful character who happened to be a lesbian. What happened? Her sexuality was one of the things that seemed to make Lucy who she was. And remind me not to rob any banks with her; she spilled her guts within 24 hrs.Bringing Benton back to life sucked the life out of Scarpetta...she was strong, intelligent, and in charge, it seems, till she met him. All of a sudden she was the damsel in distress needing to be saved by the all encompassing male hero. Rudy, the human Ken doll, deserves no mention. Never. Ever. Amen."
2,where's the ending?!,"I agree with a lot of the previous posters. I was really eager to buy this book after being a Scarpetta fan and loving most of the previous titles. I finished the book last night and was totally disappointed with the ending (or lack thereof). It was like a book version of what the Matrix Reloaded was for film, just something shoved in the middle to tie up loose ends and serve as a vehicle to promote the next installment. Disappointed."
3,"Double the pages, we need more character development!","It COULD have been good. I wish so much that Ms. Cornwell could recapture the essence of the first three books in this series. I thought this book was the one to do it, but I needed much more character development. I'm not sure if the book got the life edited out of it, but so much seemed to be missing. I just don't care about these people like I used to, and want to again! Even the big surprise wasn't enough to hold my attention. I hope so much she will continue to write this series and rekindle the fiery magic from the beginning, starting with the complete removal of the ""wolfman"" please.How about bringing the first lover back from the dead too? Working on the past of these characters would be fine, but not this brutal, sick, freaky creature, that frankly, I can't, or won't buy.Check this one out of the library. It's worth continuing the series. But, I'm sorry to have invested the money."
1,A very long Epilogue and Prologue,"That's what I felt this book was - an epilogue from the last Scarpetta novel and a prologue for the next one.The cutting of the chapters was disconcerting. A chapter would end in the middle of a conversation and the following would begin with the next line in the same conversation - huh?The book is full of hints of things that had taken place over the past three years, but no worthy details. The details were spent on things I had long stopped caring about, like why Lucy left the FBI.The revisionist history of the big ""twist"" is insulting to faithful fans, and unless the FBI has access to the same Time Turner Hermione uses in the third Harry Potter novel, flat-out impossible.Borrow it from your local library and save your money to write letters of encouragement to Ms. Cornwell, since she obviously needs it for the next installment."
2,Blow Fly,"I was bamboozled, I was hookwinked, I was cheated out of a character that I loved. After reading this book I realized that the author was just trying to get some thoughts out of her mind. This book was not up to the usual excellent writing skills and imagination of Ms. Cornwell. It jumped around as if she lost her place, things were left out and did not ever seem to fit a pattern. I hope that she can redeem herself with the next one.I refuse to let anyone else purchase it."
1,Cornwell's worst yet,"If you loved the ""old"" Kay Scarpetta novels by Cornwell (as I did!), you will find this one the biggest disappointment yet. I kept reading, thinking that it HAD to get interesting, but no dice. It was almost as if the author had to adhere to a set number of pages, then suddenly realized she only had 5 pages to go, so wrapped up the story quickly & inefficiently. The book was a waste of my money & time. I think I'll just stick with Kathy Reichs and determine that Cornwell has ""lost"" her past talent."
1,"Dumb, dumb, dumbest.","How can an individual of such intelligence, wit and coolth write so badly? This is so poorly written that I can not understand how Ms. Cornwell ever was accepted as an author. It is even worse than her attempt at humor with the novel about the Virginia cops. (Which was so bad I forgot the title!)The Characters are so one-dimensional that you can not relate to them. While the science is accurate, it is so irrelevant that you don't care.While I am certain that females take issue with the portrayal of women by male authors, Ms. Cornwell hasn't a clue about male behavior. No human male would act as she has her male characters act. Sorry Patricia, go back to talk shows and figuring out ancient crimes. You do that very well!Take my advice - don't bother with this book."
1,Who wrote this book ??!!,"I will never believe that Patricia Cornwell wrote this book. It went everywhere, yet absolutely nowhere. I'm sick of the Chandonne story line, that we clearly will be hearing from again. I'm also sick of writers having people come back from the dead, just to keep a story going. Not to mention having prisoners easily escape from maximum security prisons, just to make room for a sequal. Do you mean to tell us that prison guards let dangerous prisoners, with ""Nothing to lose"", out of handcuffs BEFORE they are safely locked in their cell ?? Please....give readers credit.The new twist with Lucy's behavior was beyond disappointing. I have been a Cornwell fan from the beginning and like another reader said, felt like throwing this book against the wall after coming to it's end, which by the way, was not the end. Will the real Patricia Cornwell please write us another book and dump the Chandonne's while she's at it?"
2,What happened to the end?,"*Warning- I give away some of the book details in this review* I have read all of the Scarpetta books and was excited to see this one at the bookstore. I have to agree with some of the other reviewers when they said that it seemed like she was in a rush to finish the book. As I was approaching the end, I kept thinking, wow, it must wrap up pretty quickly considering I only have a few pages left. It completely left me hanging! How can she tell you that a killer has escaped jail, whose only purpose seems to be to kill Scarpetta, but just leave it saying that Scarpetta knows he is coming for her and Benton next? I can't believe I spent money on a book that had no ending!"
4,"sounds plausable,",I don't know if I agree with Cornwell on what she thinks in this book but her explaination certainly is plausable! Very compelling!
2,won't read,"I haven't read this book, & I love Patricia Cornwell, but after reading the reviews I won't waste my money. I never buy a book before I read the reviews on Amazon.com.Thank you amazon.com for helping me."
4,another page turner,"Blow Fly was an incredible novel. Although there were a few choppy chapters of this particular book it was still amazing & well written. Even with all the unfinished story plot, such as Jean Babtists' escape and Bentons return,This was still one of her best books. Cornwells next book will be just as intriging im positive of that. I do have to agree that there is quite a bit of animal torture in The last precicnt & Blow Fly that I could defenetly do without. I can't wait to read her next novel and once again be pulled into amazing world of Kay Scarpetta her friends, Family, her less than perfect love Benton, And of corse the WOLFMAN!!"
5,FLIES RIGHT BY,"This is definitely one of PC's best! Her writing style, while vastly changed, is exceptional. I'm not sure if I like the style as well as her others - it is hard to get used to the 1st vs the 3rd person writing style; but the book itself is wonderful. PC has outdone herself in letting the readers see how far Kay has fallen yet there is still that spark that suggests she will become the strong Kay that was before. I think there is a human aspect to Kay this time as opposed to just the robotic perfect Kay Scarpetta presented to us in the past. Simply wonderful. Cannot wait for the next one."
3,Disappointing,"I have to say, mid way thru this book I was actually wondering why everyone thought this book was so bad. I was really getting into it. But then, I got to the end. It seems as though Ms. Cornwell was under pressure to get this book done. The ending was so anti-climatic. I felt cheated. The conclusions on the story line were so lame. There are so many factors to why this book is so disappointing, I don't know where to start. I have enjoyed all of the Scarpetta books and it saddens me to see such a feeble attmept to keep the series going."
3,I flew through Blow fly....,"This was the first book I have read from this author. I had just recently read all of Ann Rule's books and took a break from fiction/nonfiction crime drama. This one looked intriguing. I did like it and had a hard time putting it down. Some of the characters were not as developed or presented as well as I would have liked. I really did enjoy it when at the end things started to really happen. I did not like the ending because it was very abrupt and several threads are left dangling. Of course, it does leave open a door for a followup book. I just though it built to a crescendo and then hit a wall for the abrupt end. I did enjoy it and have passed it on to friends to read. I am waiting to see what they think. I will buy the Last Precint and other books by this author to read."
1,"BLOW, BLOW FLY","Who really wrote this dull, disconnected, piece of unintelligence? Surely Patricia Cornwell hasn't lost her ability to write, hasn't lost her sense of literary direction or imagination, so who wrote this long awaited piece of supremely disappointing pulp? Please Patricia, take a cruize, go to a moutain cabin by the lake, whatever it takes to get the Scarpetta novels back on line and blow that awful book.It was extremely difficult to mantain interest when the book jumped from character to character, thought stream to completely unconnected thought stream and did not offer a story line. The whole book could have been summed up in just a few lines on one page. I was very sorry I purchased two of them and would not recommend that anyone purchase this book if they are a Patricia Cornwell fan."
2,WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!,"WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT! The resurrection of Benton Wesley was never very well explained (and if you didn't read the book where he ""died"", you would be totally lost), there were several things alluded to that didn't come to fruition (e.g., what seemed to be a relationship that MIGHT develop between Lucy and Nic), but, worst of all, after chapter 118 (page 443)the author just seems to say ""I'm tired of writing so I'm quitting after a few more pages."" Everything was sort of wrapped up with few, if any, explanations and Jean-Baptist Chandonne was left out there roaming the Louisiana bayous. WHAT A CHEAP TRICK TO BRING ABOUT A SEQUEL. Well, guess what! I won't buy it or read it. Another disappointment was the fact that Kay Scarpetta wasn't much of a heroine in the book. Her former exploits were alluded to frequently but I felt as though she was crippled or retired or both. Patricia Cornwell seems to have lost her touch. YUCK!"
1,never again,"I have read all of the Scarpetta series.....loved them to start with....even stood in line 2 hours at a book signing. Then as they got grislier and gorier, I stopped buying and waited for the paper back, then used paper backs, and finally quit. I would not have this one, which is the worst, if it hadn't been given to me as a gift. I do not intend to buy another one........ever. Very disappointing to me, as they were great in the beginning."
1,Saved me the cost of the book,"As a fan of Patricia Cornwell and Kay Scarpetta, I'm glad I read the reviews of all who read Blow Fly before purchasing this book. (My title says it all.) I have read all of the Cornwell/Scarpetta novels and I, too, like many reviewers have had trouble with the Chandonne characters. I enjoyed Cornwell/Scarpetta when the focus was on the forensics. Maybe Cornwell will heed her fans demand and get back to the basics of her early novels! (Must have been a real ""shocker"" to suddenly come face to face with Benton again!)PS: Couldn't post this without giving a rating."
1,Don't Blow Your Time,"Over five hundred pages with some of the same creepy characters that were featured in the previous books, I did not like them then and I don't like them now. I was hoping to move beyond the Chandonne brothers. If you have not read the previous books the reader will be totally lost because Cornwell seems to be tying up a lot of loose ends from previous books. It seems ludicrous that after all the grieving Kay Scarpetta did for Benton that he gets resurrected. There is a big build up of events in this book, but the conclusion comes with amazing speed. It could not believe the story wrapped up so quickly. First time reader, go back and read an earlier Scarpetta novel; they were actually good."
1,Yawn.,"I usually give a book about 10 pages to pull me in before I move on (so many books, so little time...). I gave Blow Fly about 40. And after all those words, I still didn't give a rat's behind about Scarpetta or any of the other characters. I've read every Scarpetta novel, so theoretically I should have known what the backstory was, and had some emotional investment in the characters, but apparently The Last Precinct didn't make much of a lasting impression on me - I couldn't remember what had happened, or why I should care.Tempe Brennan is a more interesting medical examiner; V. I. Warshawski is a more interesting investigator; the latest novels featuring each of them were far more interesting than Blow Fly was. Maybe it's time for Scarpetta to just retire..."
1,Truly Sad...,"I, too, should have waited for the reviews instead of pre-ordering this stinker. I have admired the work that it takes to write the intricate novels that have been the forte of Ms. Cornwell and wait patiently b/c it must take considerable time and effort to write her better 'reads'. I, too, kept waiting to find the details of what I had imagined Kay's next move to be after her dismissal from Richmond. Alas, and woe is me, us, them, her... Here is to hoping that Ms. Cornwell does not go the route of 'Bobby in the shower' of Dallas fame in her next Scarpetta endeavor. Ms. Cornwell, please do the next one justice even if it is to be the end of the line for this series."
2,That's it?,Where's the ending? Did they leave out some chapters? Did she just get bored and decide to quit mid story? I love her books - this was such a disapointment.
2,Guess Cornwell ran out of antagonists!!!!,"I so looked forward to this book! Was at Border's by 9:30 on its release date to buy it. When I started reading it and realized that it was Chandonne again, I was soooo disappointed. But I kept plugging through, hoping that something would catch my interest. It didn't. I guess Patricia has run her course. Kate Scarpetta totally needs a reworking. When I think back on how exciting her first novels were, I feel screwed out of my $20.00. Oh, well, there's always Dennis Lehane and Jeffrey Deaver to look forward to. They NEVER disappoint me!"
1,Not up to the level of other Scarpetta novels,"This was the most disappointing Kay Scarpetta novel. I wish I had read the other reviews on this site before I bought the book. I probably would have bought it anyway, but maybe I would have waited until it came out in paperback. Fans will read the book to keep up with what is going on, but this is a disappointment. Much of the book is drawn out and tedious and then everything raps up in the last 10 pages. Lots of questions unanswered. Definitely just a bridge from the last book to the next one - hope the next one comes out quickly and improves upon this one."
1,The well is dry,"I think I have figured it out! Authors, whether brilliant of just plain OK, have only so many good books in them. Once they go beyond that point, it's all downhill. And when the author was brilliant, the fall appears even more dramatic and disappointing for the readers who had once anxiously awaited their next release. I would put Patricia Cornwell in the Tom Clancy category now. Both have gone way past their limit. Comparing Blow Fly to Post Mortem is like comparing Teeth of the Tiger to Hunt for the Red October. In other words, there is no comparison.If they can't or won't give us the quality that were are used to then they should not write at all."
2,Poor writing,It seems like a completely different person wrote this book. I literally had to check if the author was Cornwell. It was poorly written and just constructed.
2,Disappointing,"I kept waiting for the plot to thicken...and waiting...and waiting. It never happened. Ms. Cornwell sets up the plot, then doesn't tell the story. She hurriedly brings all the storylines together in the last few pages for an extremely clumsy finish. We aren't even given the courtesy of ""seeing"" what happens to the villains. I won't be spending money on another Patricia Cornwell novel until she decides that her readers are worth a bit more effort."
3,Disappointed,I have long awaited a return to my favorite characters...I am very disappointed. Half way through the book I am waiting and waiting for the story. I am not a pro reviewer just someone who longs for the good old days of Cornwell's good old books
1,small spoilers,"I just needed to add my vote to the ""very disappointed"" list.It wasn't a bad thing that Ms. Cromwell switched to a narrative point of view, but the 1- to 2-page chapters were very disjointed, taking up a lot of space in the novel without giving bulk to the storyline.The characters had all lost their character. (I MISSED Marino's ""Yo!"") No one talked the way we've become accustomed to them talking.The climactic ending was anything but climactic. Did Ms. Cromwell get bored with her own novel at the very end? We weren't even allowed to ""witness"" what should have been a very satisfying end to the serial killer, we're just told that he's dead and we have to be satisfied with that.I will definitely wait until I read the reviews of the next Kay Scarpetta novel, because even the ""cliffhanger"" isn't enough to drive me to the book store."
1,What a bummer,"I love the Scarpetta series and am a huge fan. I gave the police series a chance but didn't like it, so I have been anxiously waiting for the next KS book. Unfortunately, it would appear that Cornwell has forgotten how to write. This book made no sense - it meandered around circling a story without ever actually telling it, and then it ended so abruptly my head was spinning. I am hopeful that this book was simply filler - something to keep the readers busy until the next real novel came out - but I am going to wait for the reviews before buying any more Cornwell books instead of gobbling them up first thing!"
1,Patricia Cornwell - Blowfly,I have read all of Patricia Cornwell's books and enjoyed them immensely. If this was the first Cornwell book I had read I would not have bothered with any more.This book was totally disjointed - towards the end I had to keep re-reading the pages to see if I had missed something.I really believe that this book was not writted by Patricia Cornwell.
2,"Just a disappointment,,,","I am such a Cornwell fan, reading all of her book, even the cook book! But this one is not her best work. Seems as though this book wasn't cared about. Took me forever to read it and I usually read them in days. The wittness protection card has been played so many times, it's just a tired story line. I found myself not caring about the characters like I have in other books. The ending was so weak I didn't realize it was the ending. How disappointed I am, perhaps next time Patricia."
2,"Big wind-up, no delivery","Having read The Last Precinct, I looked forward to its follow-up, where hopefully Cornwell would help convict the Hairy One (Jean Cardonne) and in the process also jail his crime-ridden French family. Alas, Blow Fly gets off to a good start but dissolves like the Wicked Witch in The Wizard of Oz in it last hundred pages --a puddle of slimy goo on the floor. A long dead Scarpetta lover suddenly reappears. Jean Cardonne --supposedly blinded by acid-- can suddenly see again and escapes from prison. Further we are subjected to page after page of pyscho-babble as Scarpetta's inner self is explored. And the ending, oh the ending ! It sets us up for still ANOTHER Hairy One saga.Not for me, Ms. Cornwell, unless you catch and kill him off in the very first chapter and proceed with another totally new set of Scarpetta characters, letting Kay do what she does best, working her forensic magic with the likes of Marino to chase down the perps."
1,Really Disappointed,"I have enjoyed Ms. Cornwell's previous books, that when I saw that she had written a New Scarpetta novel I immediately bought it. The book was a terrible disspointment. The story line, if you can call it that was never really established. It was nothing morning than snipits of various charters lines which really went nowhere. New potentially interesting characters were introduced but they were never really connected to the story line in any meaningful way. The chapters were two pages long and resembled notes for ideas which were never put together or developed. Ms. Cronwell's writings have evolved into dark tales of the seriously mentally ill rather than on Ms. Scarpetta's talents as a forensic pathologist. Too bad I was really looking forward to a good read, this book was not."
2,Blows: A Series,I will be short. Only the serious die-hard fans will appreciate this book. The pacing is all off. The third person doesn't work here. I found the different storylines and storytelling confusing and distracting. This is second-rate at best and a trend in poor storytelling. All that is happening is so unreal and an insult to the reader! This book blows!
4,I guess I'm one of the few,"I enjoyed this novel very much. I enjoyed the different writing style she utilized in this book, the simultaneous time lines and different perspectives. It was an interesting departure from her normal style. I also liked that a number of long arching story lines were tied in and explained better. My only complaint is the ending, I wanted to keep going and read more, find out more, but the book ended like hitting a wall at high speed. And unfortunately, I'm very impatient and hate to wait for the next installment. I want to know what happens to Kay, Benton, Lucy, Nic...I don't like ""To be continued."""
4,We waited soooooo long..................,"Having read the series from the beginning (some of the books twice waiting for the next installment): love the character, style of writing, and details, details, details! Didn't like third person, and the style of writing is unlike the other books, but I do feel Cornwell sets up numerous future books with all the possibilities unresolved by the ending. The style of writing seemed to mirror Scarpetta's current frame of mind & mood. A must read for a true fan... but I'll start to lose interest if the next one is written in third person."
4,Better than I expected,"After reading the brutal reviews posted here, I expected much worse. What I like about this series is how the characters grow, both in age and emotion. Lucy started out as a computer geek little girl and now she's gone through the FBI, DEA, got promoted, got fired, and winds up the strongest characacter in this installment, teaming up with partner Rudy (interesting duo). Even Marino is on Lucy's payroll. This series so far, as in real life, has resulted in a weary and troubled Kay Scarpetta getting tossed out of Virginia and banashed to consulting work in Florida, Marino and Lucy sharing a deep, dark secret that can never be exposed to Kay, 'the wolfman' waiting to be executed on death row in Texas, and two seriously nasty serial killers. I won't give away any plot details - this is a very interesting read. If you've gotten this far in the series, this is just another good installment - the next one should shed light on the untied knots at the end."
3,Better than Trace,"I don't know why people write these boorriiinngg synopsis of books, do you really want to know the WHOLE story before you read the book. Some of these reviews give up the entire book; some are as long as the book itself. Anyway, this is an average Scarpetta book, it's taunt and I liked the Louisiana locations. This is a better book than Cornwell's current book Trace. If you have not read Cornwell's Scarpetta books before, I urge you to start at the beginning, they are the better books, plus the series builds on itself."
2,"Hey, Patricia,.... You can do better!!","I'm a die-hard loyal Scarpetta fan, but I must say I'm a little disappointed in this book.When I hard Kay Scarpetta was coming back, I marked my calendar for release date, & began counting the days!As I started reading I kept waiting for that ""magic"" hook to come along-you know the one that grabs you and won't allow you to put the book down, keeps you up all night- but it never came, but kept reading till the end. As I turned the last page, it was like ""what,.....thats it?!""Try again, Patricia.You left Chandonne open, let's do better this time, let us see some of the passion that Kay feels on a case."
2,Eh...its ok?,"I've been a devoted fan of Cornwell's work from the beginning. With that said, I thought this book should never have been written. The way she brought past events into the storyline made no sense and the characters were superficial. How do you explain the tie-up of the Talley & Chandonne characters? How does Lucy go from being a computer geek to somekind of superspy vigilante? And Marino..he used to have some really good depth to his character, now it seems like he's comic relief. Would someone please explain how can you bring back a character like Wesley on such a lame premise?!? C'mon Cornwell, stay true to your fans, don't just write a book to make money."
3,Lost,I 'm trying to figure out in what book Benton Wesley returned? All of the books of Ms.Cornwell were very good . Keep up the good work.
1,What a mess,"This reads like a novelist's first effort. It's badly written and badly edited. Unnecessary, speculative descriptions of characters that appear for only a paragraph feel like padding, while Scarpetta herself is almost an incidental character. Lucy is a mess. Teasing her partner? Annoying. Murdering another character? Unconscionable, even if he is a scum bag. Cornwell's knowledge is starting to grate; her description of a helicopter pre-flight routine doesn't add to the story, it feels like she's showing off. And the plot? Absurd. (Please tell me why Lucy the technological wizard immediately thinks Chandonne has escaped when he supposedly calls her from in front of her building; can't she call the Texas prison to check? Ridiculous!) I wish Cornwell hadn't published this book; it shows a certain level of scorn for her many fans."
2,Not my favorite,"The ending falls far short of what you'd hope for - the Scarpetta novels are often a pleasant (if reading about murder can be pleasant!) way to pass an afternoon, engrossed in an engaging story. In this novel, Cornwell weaves together the lives of various characters, allowing the reader to see into the mind of the killers from the beginning. Given all that we ""see"" as readers early on, one would expect to see all of the results unfold in front of our eyes (in words and, therefore, in our imaginations): not so. If you don't mind a disappointing ending, read this book."
1,"Needs an editor (and a plot, and better characters and...)","Quite simply the worst installment yet of the Scarpetta series. When will Mrs. Corwall get over her fascination with the Chardonne family and get back to writing the forensic thrillers that made the Scarpetta series such a hit? The latest Wolfman reprise gave hope in that promised to be the last...until the final pages where it's obvious that he will reappear in a future novel. Scarpetta, save us!"
1,thank goodness for libraries,"Cornwell's writing lacks depth in this book ... the book is disjointed and the writing is simple. After plodding along for awhile, I took the book back to the library."
1,What the _ _ _ _ did I just read!,"I finished ""Blow Fly"" last night and was really disappointed. The first 80% of the book did nothing but dredge up old characters and plots. There was very little if any forensic work which is the reason I read Cornwell. The ending felt like I fell over a cliff. When I read the last page, I wondered ""What the (blank) did I just read?"". Patricia Cornwell will now join James Patterson as two authors I will not subject myself to until they clean up their acts! If you like a good forensic read, check out Kathy Reichs."
1,Don't bother . . . .,"Either Cornwell has lost her touch, or is off her meds. This Scarpetta novel is as bad as Hornet's Nest and Southern Cross.The ever-changing inner perspective of the characters (Kay, Lucy, Marino, Benton, Jean Baptiste) was just annoying. I am surprised we didn't get a chapter from the dog's point of view. The plot didn't seem to going anywhere, then all the loose ends were hastily tied up in the last 20 pages.A lot of the plot devices were just plain stupid (the kid and crooked US attorney ""just happen"" to be on the plane with Kay - yeah right!)Someone do a post-mortem - because the Kay Scarpetta we loved is dead. She's been killed off by her egotistical creator. This boodk at the top of the bestseller lists, but that is due to Cornwell's past reputation and shouldn't be taken as a indication that one should waste time reading this piece of tripe."
1,"Kay Scarpetta, R.I.P.","I don't know how long I can keep on buying Cornwell's follies. First there was Isle of Dogs -- perhaps the worst book EVER. Now there's this Kay Scarpetta book with almost no Kay Scarpetta, and even the meager appearances don't ring true. Here's a frightening thought: Cornwell has lost touch with her own main character. Lucy commits cold-blooded murder in this book, and Kay is OK with that. My old pals Kay and Marino used to go to any length to catch the bad guys. Now I can't tell them apart.So not only is the main character MIA, but there's nothing to like. The plot is nonsense, Lucy's secret agent antics are pointless, Benton's resurrection just means we're in for more bad relationship scenes, and it's like Kay suddenly drank Love Potion No. 9: everyone loves or admires or lusts after her.The longer you dwell on this book, the worse you feel. Nothing adds up, nothing makes sense."
1,This is a horrible book,Could not even finish this book. Written in the 3rd person it is very hard to follow.I have waited for this book for several months.Patricia Cornwell is a much better writer than this book portrays. I wish I would have taken the time to read the online reviews before I spent my hard earned cash on this book.
2,"Pathetic...what's wrong with you, Patricia Cornwell...?!","This was perhaps the worst of the Kay Scarpetta books, and I consider myself a loyal fan of Patricia Cornwell's. The characters are disjointed and the plot lurches from one improbable scenario to the next. The introduction of the character Nic(olette) Robillard is purposeless, as her development is so stunted I felt no sympathy whatsoever even though this woman is seeking justice for her mother's murder while simultaneously trying to raise a small son on her own since her husband abandoned them. While it was indeed fun to revisit the horrific brothers Chandonne and the palpably nasty Bev Kiffin, the last 10 pages of this novel are clearly a hastily, poorly thought-out, thrown-together attempt at bringing closure to the entire mess. It's so hurriedly concluded I literally felt betrayed by the time I got to the last page. I'm not bothering to read any further Scarpetta tales after this debacle."
1,"My Favorite Author, But...","This book fails to live up to the standards we have come to expect from Patricia Cornwell. It is as if someone else wrote this book. Perhaps after the aptly named ""Isle of Dogs"" and the non-fiction Jack the Ripper book, she lost touch with Scarpetta and how to write her.Cornwell abandoned her usual style of writing her hero in the first person, and in so doing lost her focus. Gone are the things that made Kay Scarpetta so compelling--her investigation skills, her caring for those close to her, her cooking.Simply as a work of fiction, it is a book that spends 400 pages on its set-up, and only a few paragraphs on the payoff. This is not a good book in any sense. It seems that Cornwell may be spending too much time on ""Prime Time Live"", and not enough on what made her so popular. Until then, the reaser may want to spend time reading Lisa Scottoline instead."
1,"ouch, it hurts","Reading this book was painful. I had to force myself to keep turning the pages, which is quite a change from earlier Cornwell novels, when they almost seemed to turn themselves. Halfway through I was ready to just put it down, so I came here to read the reviews and see if there might be something coming up in the second half that would make forcing my way through this somehow worthwhile, but everyone else's reviews were absolutely correct: This book is awful."
1,What's the point?,I've obviously missed something big regarding Patricia Cornwell's relationship with Scarpetta. Why so much narrative rather than action and dialogue? Why the muddy plot? Is this Cornwell's attempt to drive readers away from Scarpetta so that Cornwell doesn't have to write about her anymore? I'm confused.
1,was there a fire in the building?,"Things were going along fairly well. I was interested but then I suddenly realized, I was literally in the middle of the story and there were 30 pages to go. This book ends as though the building were on fire and PC had to run. One of the lamest attempts at an ending I've ever seen. Next time PC, spend a little more time wrapping it up. I have read every book and always buy hard cover because I'm too impatient to wait for paperbacks but I am seriously considering not going for the hard cover next time. PC what are you doing?"
1,Unreadable,"I was given this book as a birthday present from someone who knew I liked writers like Tess Gerritsen and Lisa Gardner. Having never read any of the previous 'Scarpetta' novels, I will confess that I was somewhat in the dark about the history of the characters. Unfortunately, I could find no characters that I cared about or were the least bit interested in. I was also given another 'Scarpetta' novel to read, but I think I am going to pass. BLOW FLY was absolutely unreadable. One of the worst reading projects I have ever attempted."
1,An imposter must have written this!,"I started reading the Scarpetta novels in order a couple months ago and finally got to Blow Fly. Upon starting this book, I immediately felt disconnected from the character of Kay. All of a sudden Kay is now just 'Scarpetta' and is treated like a background character. The feelings and thoughts are not there in this book, it is like someone else stepped in to write this one. What should have been an explosive revalation in the book was barely even a wimper and was casually mentioned like what the author had for breakfast. The end was awful too. It was like Cornwell got tired of writing and then just wrapped things up in a few paragraphs. I hope like heck that the next book in the series is back to the original format, this one was a definite downer."
2,Horrific crimes and abrupt ending!,"I've loved Patricia Cornwell's Scarpetta novels for a few years. I was excited to pick up Blow Fly but had a tough time with all the abundance of horrific details of the crimes. The twists and turns the story was taking had me spellbound yet at times confused. But as I neared the last 5 pages of the book, I wondered how the book was going to end and tie up all the ends...and boy, was I on target and VERY unhappy with the ending! Benton knew the Dard family and associates and they didn't know who he was? And he happened to kill one twin in the wine cellar while the other twin gets away so easily? Give me a break...it all ended too quickly, too conveniently when there was so much wonderful promise...what a huge disappointment. And now after reading reviews of her next 2 books, Trace & Predator, I'm not sure I can stand more disappointment and gore through Scarpetta's eyes. I think I'll be looking for a new author who is more consistent...sorry Patricia!"
1,A waste of time,"I'd have to agree that this was a major disappointment, especially after waiting so long for another Scarpetta book. I would have been willing to wait longer for a good one. After reading for what seems like forever, on all sorts of different tangents, I noticed the end of the book was getting very close and I didn't see how everything could be resolved satisfactorily in the remaining chapters. I was right. The ending comes out of nowhere, no suspense, is over before you know it, and leaves you thinking, ""That's it? What a waste of time."" The whole book shakily builds up to a nothing ending. I'm glad I only borrowed this from the library, and didn't buy it."
2,What Happened?,"I have been a Kay Scarpetta fan since the inception of the series, but the past few books have left me disappointed and wondering where Patricia Cornwell had gone - they read like someone else wrote them. After reading ""Blow Fly"", I'm quitting the series. This book was so diappointing. I won't give a description since that has been done, but would like to know - what happened? Where are you, Ms. Cornwell?"
2,What a huge disappointment...,"Huge disappointment in the Scarpetta series. The book seems to be loosely gathered ideas, the plot jumping all over the place.Jean-Baptiste Chardonne, on death row, suddenly contacts Scarpetta, Lucy, and Marino. He's planning some sort of show down, but what can it possibly be leading to, with him on death row? A side plot involves a chain of murders in Louisiana, which Scarpetta is called upon to assist in - but could this be some sort of manipulation, too, on Chardonne's part?Very little actual action in this book, and Scarpetta actually plays more of a supporting role than the lead. A different - but unsuccessful - venture for Cornwell.There is a huge surprise in this book, that I don't want to spoil - but I will say, that I can't understand why Scarpetta wasn't aware of it LONG before now. Extremely incredible, to me. Also, the cheap unfinished ending detracts from the book as a whole. Very dissatisfying read - sure hope the series can pick up soon."
1,Bring back Kay Scarpetta,"Just finished ""Blowfly"" after waiting 4 1/2 months to get it from the library. I read a lot about Lucy who almost seems not to be the same Lucy, and way too much about the character I didn't even like in the past novels, Jean-Baptiste Chandonne. Kay Scarpetta and Pete Marino seemed to be incidential characters. The chapters seemed to ""hop around"" from one character to another and I got to the point where I didn't even bother to keep it all straight. I was able to put the book down 12 pages before the end to start dinner!"
1,Pitiful effort,"I was so excited that there was finally a new Kay Scarpetta book by Patricia Cornwell, but after reading it the only word that comes to mind is ""pitiful"". What a waste of talent. This book was leaden. The well-known and normally well-drawn characters were twisted and contorted beyond recongnition. The new characters got no development, and therefore I could not have cared less if they lived or died. And the ""surprise"" was stupid and ill-conceived. So sad, so bad."
1,The Dark Side of the Force,"This is just amazingly bad. Cornwell has spent way too long gazing at the Dark Side of the Force. The improbable Jean-Baptist Chandonne and his absurd family of criminal masterminds have taken over the novels. What made the Scarpetta series interesting was the forensics, and maybe with CSI This and That all over TV, Cornwell thought she should d something different, not realizing that the serial killer is a truly overworked genre.Everyone in this series is angry and out of control, not just the criminals; it's depressing, for in reality things just don't work that way. There are always sane, focused individuals who make the world work, despite the angry dysfunctionals. Cornwell has lost sight of that and of the drama in the confrontation of the competent and the others.Avoid."
2,Now its offical,"Friends of mine have been saying for a bit now that the Scarpeta serise is done. I didn't want to belive them than I read Blowfly.Patrica Cornwell has fallen victim to ""established Author Syndrom"". I didn't think it could ever happen to her but I shouldn't be surprised considering how often it has happenned to others. Just to name a few Tom Clancy, Ann Rice, Stepen king and Robert Jordon. It is indeed a sad day.Overall-Not bad, just the same old same old forulmatic and predictable."
2,Not to bad but bad enough,"This is so not typical. What happened. All through the book I was wondering if there was a book prior to this that can explain how the character got so depressed, ugly and just painfull to read about.And the Benton story?? That is so lame!! She better not kill him off or do some dramatic things around his character. And if it ends up Benton and Kay under witness protection together, happy ever after I am really going to faint!"
2,Why the Title?,"To save some verbage, I agree with so many of the most recent negative reviews for all the same reasons: way too many plots/characters/overlapping details/unlikely far-fetched coincidences, an ending that's far too abrubt and unbelievable, characters with whom it's hard to feel intimate, much less sympathetic (PLEASE, GIVE ME AT LEAST ONE CHARACTER I CAN CARE ABOUT AND LIKE!!!!). This book was dark, dark, dark ... and I was ashamed of myself for continuing to subject myself to wading thru the muck - tHere was no redeeming point to doing so. And, truly, why the title, BLOW FLY? The flies were one small element in one chapter early in the book. Perhaps they have some importance to the rest of the story that I was too ignorant to follow; but anyway, I don't get it. And I don't recommend this book to anyone. I'm off to read some Anne of Green Gables to get the bad taste out of my mouth...."
2,Blow Fly Blows,"I love the Scarpetta books, however Blow Fly was really disappointing. Two thirds of the book was good, the ending was really horrible. I had to go back a couple pages to find out what happened to a character and there was nothing. When I continued reading ""Oh he's dead, I shot him"". What? Did PC actually write this book? I did like the explaination of how she brought a character back, but the ending was so chopped up and nothing was in detail like her other books with Scarpetta. This was a waste of money. I should have rented it. haha"
1,What was that????,"HUGE disappointment! I should have known from the moment that Patricia Cornwell started referring to the main character as ""Scarpetta"" that something was seriously wrong with this book. Finished it only out of morbid curiousity - could this actually get worse?"
1,A fly in my soup would be more enjoyable!,"As a fan of Patricia Cornwell, I was really disappointed by this novel. It almost seemed as if someone else wrote the book, and not Cornwell. The characters lacked their usual depth, grittiness, and familial interaction. Lucy, Marino, and Scarpetta seemed cardboard and hollow, almost one dimensional. Half of the book is spent reminding the reader of each character's history (as if we need a refresher course). This lackluster effort comes to a dismal, predictable, and incredibly speedy ending. The finale is probably the worst part of the novel, as it wraps up in about 5 pages, without a hint of suspense, drama, or thrill. Definitely not an ""edge of your seat"" read. Fans should skip this one and hope the next effort is better."
1,Disappointing,"Poorly written. Plot was never developed and the novel ended abruptly. As a long time fan of the Scarpetta series, this was a tremendous disappointment. Wait for the paperback issue if you truly want to read this book."
2,"Pat, what happened?!?",I have to agree with these other reviewers. This book was not of Patricia Cornwell's usual high quality. I was looking forward to reading a new Scarpetta novel after wading through Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed. Unfortunately this book lacked the suspense seen in previous Scarpetta novels. I thought the writing also lacked the edge I have come to expect from Ms. Cornwell. The ending was both too easy as well as unbelievable.
3,What happened to Cornwell?,"I've been hooked on Cornwell's Scarpetta series since the first and have eagerly anticipated this latest. This book was a complete disappointment. The plot was excellent, I'd give it 5 stars for that, but her writing style has completely changed. Blow Fly is written in a very impersonal, formal, third person style that is not consistent with the rest of the Scarpetta novels. This left me cold. One of the draws of the rest of the series is the feeling of being able to be ""inside Scarpetta's head"" and follow the story from her point of view. There is none of that with this book. If there are any others in the future, I hope Cornwell goes back to her old style of writing. This was about as terrible as Hornet's Nest and Southern Cross."
2,Left hanging,As happy as I was to be reading a Patricia Cornwell again and Kay Scarpetta with all her friends and colleagues...the ending was extremely disappointing. It left me with the impression that her editor called and said...'hurry up and finish it anyway you can!' I'm willing to give the next one a read but should it be as disappointing as this one...then Ms. Cornwell should retire this series all together.
2,Slipshod,"Looks like there was a rush to end this one without much reference to what came earlier. When we have a blind man escaping from prison by driving away, I began to suspect that the author lost track of the plot somewhere along the plot line."
1,Terrible,"With 20 pages to go in the book, I was sick to think that this must just be part one of a long, confusing, annoying 2-book sequence. Then, boom,it was over. The auhor must have hit her editor's deadline or she, too,was so sick of the book that she just wanted to end it as quickly as possible. All action takes place ""off screen"". 9 out of 10 plot twists lead nowhere. WAY too much time is spent finding out what a psychopath is thinking. This was the WORST book I have read in years. I cannot convey how bad this one is. Avoid... Or, just read the last 10 pages - the first 400 don't have anything to do with them anyway."
4,"Good, entertaining, but...","I, too, questioned if this was really Cornwell's book. Written in third person, and focusing more on the ""supporting cast"" rather than Scarpetta herself... it just did not seem to be by the same author. However, it could be Cornwell's desire to explore different writing styles. Perhaps Cornwell has visions of a character series that will spin off from the Scarpetta novels. Regardless, I enjoyed this book immensely, and am already anticipating her next piece of work."
3,"Amanda from Houston, TX","I thought that this book wasn't one of her best attempts yet. I am really getting tired of reading about this Chandonne character, but maybe her next book will be better. Maybe Dr. Scarpetta will be more like the past. We can only hope.Well, Patricia Cornwell has me hooked anyway, even if this wasn't her best book. I will be first in line when her next one comes out."
3,Something's missing.,"Kay Scarpetta is missing for Cornwell's newest novel 'Blow Fly', but the usual cast of characters such as Jean-Baptiste Chandonne, Wolfman,Lucy, and Marino are here. I am not sure if I am such a fan of Kay Scarpetta or the character development here was not up to Cornwell's traditional standards."
2,"I couldn't put it down, at first.........","I agree with those who reviewed this and asked, ""what happened to the ending?"" I too was disappointed and toward the end, was thinking, how could there possibly be only a few pages left when the story just got really good? So I give it 2 stars because it started out really good, but it ended abruptly. I also agree with others who state that Scarpetta is a dark depressing figure, Marino is a pathetic overweight person and Lucy, in this one, she comes on to her partner who is a male, so this just adds some confusion and hypocrcy. Overall though, I have thoroughly enjoyed Patricia Cornwell novels, but I am left confused and thinking I need to reread to figure out how we got from point a to point b...."
4,Disappointing Ending,"I loved this book until the last 2 chapters. I do not feel that the story had a conclusion. It was all left hanging. It was like someone was in a hurry and just stopped. We have no idea what happened at the shack to Bev Kiffin, Benton just says that he killed everybody in the cave, no action there, and at the very end Scapetta just touches his face. What about Albert? I felt like this was the cliffhanger for the end of a season series and we just have to hang out until next season. I have read most of Cornwall books, and this is the first time that I felt like it just wasn't finished."
2,What?,"Ok I am totally confused by the whole Benton thing, it's worse than a soap opera! It being written in the 3rd person was bizarre since none of the other Scarpetta's are. She has set it up for the next book but poorly done. I am a die hard Patricia Cornwell fan but this book had no passion to it... reminiscent of Un-Natural Exposure. I am very disappointed and see I am not the only one! Better book next time?"
1,Please!!!,"This book is awful! I found myself wondering if it had been ghost written by someone who hadn't bothered reading the other books in the series. The characters are caricatures of themselves, and the story line and ""ending"" are ridiculous. I have never written a review before, but I was moved to do so by the sheer awfulness of this book. Patricia Cornwell can, and should, do better. She owes more to her readers."
1,I waited three years for this?,"I was a big fan of PC, but sadly she was all over the map with this story line. The ending was abrupt and left far to many unanswered questions. It seemed as if PC was getting tired of her own story toward the end and just pulled the plug. PC is more talented than what was projected in this book. If this was my first time reading a Scarpetta novel, it would have been my last. I loved her work in the past and will give her one more chance, but that's it."
1,As Bad as James Patterson,"I agree with all the reviews that said this book sucks. Instead of Serial Killer, this book can be summarized as ""Serial Sequels"". The only book in recent memory worse than Blow Fly is Big Bad Wolf by James Patterson."
2,Not the best,"I am a HUGE fan of Patricia Conrwell and was excited to see this book come out. However it just isn't up to her usual standard. I agree with the other posters, it seems like the end was hurried and just thrown together. I think the ending could have been better. So what if it they would have stretched the book out another 50 pages to finish it right. I read Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix in two days. I could have handled a few more pages to wrap this book up right."
1,The worst,"I read Isle of Dogs and thought it was the worst book that Cornwell ever wrote. Move over Isle, Blow Fly has you beaten by a mile.At least I was able to finish Isle of Dogs, but I will never finish this one.I wish I had read all the reviews first at this site before I wasted my time and money."
1,Too Bad,"Always anxiously waiting for her latest novel, I was truly disappointed with this incredibly bad novel. Sorry, it was a disjointed story with an ultimate insult when he walks out of deathrow? So predictable and not even believable. The last two books I read were so disappointing. It'll take a really inspiring tale to get me to buy another one of her novels. Too bad."
2,Psycopathic nightmare,"I've read two Patricia Cornwell novels featuring Dr.Kay Scarpetta in a row and feel that the time has come to give all of her gruesome characters a rest..one CAN overdose on horror and bloodshed. Kay recieves a message that her nemesis, Jean-Baptists Chardonne, wants to see her while he is still on death row, awaiting execution.She is repulsed by the thought of having to meet this hair covered maniac who tried to kill her but can't resist trying to discover the secrets that only he knows about the criminal organisation which is wreaking such havoc in the world. She teams up with her old friend Detective Pete Marino and her niece Lucy, who heads up an Intelligence network and begins an investigation which leads deep into the swamps of Louisiana and even deeper into the horrifying depths of Chandonne's family."
2,Who are these characters really???,"I generally like Cornwell's books, but this was a hugh disappointment. If, this was your first then it may not be as bad because you are not familiar with the characters. Although if you have read previous books you still may not know who these people are, I did not. Lucy who loves her aunt and is driven to murder in this book so that her aunt can be reunited with the ""love of her life,"" has totally went off the deep end. And wouldn't you think her and Dan would have talked about the dead Benson is previous books, seeing as how know everything that they stood against before they are willing to throw to the wind for this reunion? I really had a hard time getting past the character shifts to enjoy the story. I found myself actually being drawn to the secondary characters more because of this shift. And as for the ending, I agree with most of the other readers, where is it."
1,What a bomb!,"Patricia, did someone hold a gun to your head forcing you to write this drivel? I've been a diehard fan since your very first book; but the last several Scarpetta novels have gone from bad to worst. When I saw that there were only a few pages left of Blow Fly, I assumed I'd gotten a defective copy since there was no way all the various story lines could be wrapped up satisfactorily. Well, they weren't. Bang, bang! Everyone's dead. Benton is alive again, and all is forgiven by Kay.Please take your time and write a good book next time, or don't waste our time or dollars."
2,Boring,"This book is so boring I'm barely getting through it but want to finish it in case the next book in the series is better. Kay is the BEST forensic pathologist, Lucy is the BEST whatever she is, Benton is the BEST profiler. Only Marino is still likeable to me. And I'm sick of the name Chandonne."
1,Blow Fly another Dallas dream,"I have read EVERY Kay Scarpetta/Cornwell book and enjoyed every one EXCEPT ""Blow Fly"". The critics ARE RIGHT this time... the book is boring & is not up to the quality that Cornwell is/was known for. Then when her boyfriend, who was supposedly killed in a previous book, reappears live and well---reminded me of the dream episode from Dallas. ie: when you run out of story lines, bring back a dead character! Don't they do that on soap operas, too? If you do decide to read it, it can easily be skimmed by skipping whole pages to get to 2 or 3 interesting parts.This book should be on the shelf with cheap romance novels. I am hoping ""Trace"" is better...I'm going to read the reviews."
2,Cornwell has lost her way...,"I was so excited for the new Scarpetta novel, but this book reads like a bad soap opera! People rising from the dead, old villians returning, etc etc. And Kay is this weak, sad character. I struggled to get to the end...and then was left hanging. Just not good!!!!!!!!!"
1,lab rat reads again,I agree with 95per cent of the reviews here. This book was very bad and I really did not want to give it one star. I no longer enjoy the Scarpetta books. The last one was pretty marginal also.
1,Done with Cornwell,"This is a terrible novel. Does Cornwell just live on her laurels these days? None of her later novels reach the quality of her earlier books. In Blowfly there is too much of an effort to mix all of her earlier characters, and this does not work.Sorry all this has happened to an author I use to enjoy."
1,The worst Cornwell ever,"I, too, am a long time Scarpetta fan who was terribly disappointed in this book. The build up was fine, and I was expecting a great showdown between Scarpetta, and Jean-Baptiste, with the aid of Lucy, Marino, Nic & Rudy, and the final twist being the revelation that Benton is alive.Instead, the Jean-Baptiste escape went nowhere except to leave open the possibility of a sequel. Scarpetta's discovery of Benton was so bland as to be ridiculous. The showdown with Lucy, Marino & the others was a complete letdown.I too feel as if Cornwell just got tired of the book and decided to quit writing. I had read that this book was bad, so I borrowed it from the library. As I read, I started to feel that it wasn't so bad, but then the ending just completely ruined it. I felt duped! I wasted so much time reading the build up, and the climax was non-existent."
1,Feeble attempt by author to redeem herself,"I was a huge fan of Patricia Cornwell (mainly because of her character Scarpetta) until she wrote the worst book ever written - Isle of Dogs. I vowed I would never waste another dime on her books. I borrowed Blow Fly only because it was a Scarpetta novel. After reading the first few very depressing chapters, I realized I no longer cared about her characters. I skimmed the next half, and only began to take an interest (albeit minor) in the old gang in the last few chapters.I've read my last Cornwell book. Even though she didn't resolve the characters and plot, I'm resolved I'm not going to waste any more time reading anything by Patricia Cornwell. How in the world does she continue to get featured by book clubs???? - obviously they don't get advanced copies.Amazon clearly needs a rating below 1 star - I think a 'rotten egg' rating would be appropriate here."
2,whose fantasy is scarpetta living?,"One wonders whether Cornwell is getting bored with her own life. Writing is invention, not acting out! Get with it, PC, and bring back the old Kay! Forget about mooning over old lovers. The whole business with Wesley was never quite believable anyway. And what in the world is happening to Lucy? She is metamorphosing into an adult Kay, but showing psychopathic tendencies. Yikes!"
2,disappointing,I wonder what the heck happened to my favorite characters. I've been an avid follower of the Scarpetta series and it just breaks my heart to see the downfall of one of my most loved fictional characters- Kay Scarpetta. I hate Blow Fly!!! After The Last Precinct I couldn't wait for the follow up but then Blow Fly turned out to be a dismay. What happened to Lucy? She used to be very inspiring but in this latest book her character seemed shallow and ineffective. There's not an iota of thrill and suspense in this book - a far cry from the previous Scarpetta novels that smack of chilling and riveting scenes that made my hands shake while reading in the wee hours of the morning.Anyway I'm not giving up on Cornwell. I'll just wait for the next book and hope for the best.
3,Not Cornwell's best,"I love Cornwell's writing usually, but the ending of this book is choppy and happens so quickly you'll go back and make sure you didn't miss any pages. The story and plot itself are good, just the ending is disappointing."
1,NOT AGAIN !!!!!!,"After reading 'Black Notice' I decided to remove Cornwell from my library. Weak as I am though, I read 'Blow Fly.' Another disappointment. Same old story. Cornwall needs a sabbatical to give us some fresh material."
1,"Yes, it's really awful.","Like lots of other readers, I have read all of the Scarpetta novels and loved them. This one is beyond terrible. It is very boring, quite distasteful (sick really), and the main characters are no longer likeable. Kay is in love with herself and mean. Benton is mean and rude. Lucy is crazy and makes stupid mistakes. And Marino has no dimension. I would say that P.C. didn't write this book, but her previous book about Jack the Ripper wasn't very good either. There was so much ego in it.Skip this one."
1,Borrow don't buy,"V. disappointed. It almost seemed that it was written by someone other than Patricia Cornwell. If this had been her first book, I would not have read another.Does a disservice to her previous novels.Barbara."
1,Cornwell has lost it,"Patricia Cornwell's series has been patchy with some of the books gripping and others limp but this time she has really lost it. The plot has become totally unbelievable, reviving the lost lover a device that was stale long ago and doesn't work in this novel. Scarpetta has become merely a neurotic, ineffective cypher.Give up the series Cornwell and try something else.If there was a negative rating I would give it to this book."
2,??,I'm still wondering if this is really a Cornwell book. If her name had not been listed as the author I would have been certain someone else had written the book. Totally not in the typical Cornwell catagory. I hope she has plans for better in the future.
2,Below Average,I've read all of the Scarpetta novels and this one is just plain bad. It was more like a soap opera novel than anything else and I'm hoping Cornwell will get back to putting Scarpetta doing what she does best.
2,Not up to par,"I'm a huge Patricia Cornwell fan and couldn't wait to read this book on paperback, so bought a hardcover.Big mistake.It just never took off. Nothing was added to the character line and the storyline is played out.Not enough time was spent with Kay and forensic pathology. I don't know if the editor butchered it or if Patricia was working under a deadline...who knows, but it doesn't measure up."
2,Blowfly - Very Disappointing,"I was SO happy that Patricia Cornwell had finally gotten back to writing her ""Kay Scarpetta"" novels. I had truly missed all the characters. But, I was so disappointed in the ending of Blowfly. If I had learned what had happened to Benton Wesley after all this time, I would of been furious. Everyone she cared about knew the truth and kept it from her. This just didn't have Patricia's usual ""punch."" I am hoping that her next Scarpetta novel won't be three years down the road and I also hope it will be a little more in-depth. I really like the characters in this series but I was not thrilled with the way they were portrayed this time around."
1,The ending runied the book,"The ending of this book seems rushed, as if Cornwell finished it quickly to get the book out on the stands. It leaves you not just hanging (which would be ok) but checking to make sure you picked-up a complete copy of the book! I seriously thought there was a chapter missing from my book. Don't bother reading this until the next book is out to complete the story."
3,Better than The Last Precinct but..... (Spoiler!!),"There were some story lines which should have been developed further. First, Benton's return was expected, but he jumped from not caring what happened to all the sudden being in the thick of things. The author did not make his change of mindset very apparent. Additionally, the bad woman who took all the abuse from Jay was not very developed. Her actions and reasoning made zero sense. Because of these things, the anticipation and suspense fell flat. I really believe that the magic of Kay S. is gone just to be another paper mill book series printed as quickly as possible."
3,"Good book, great author, but broke my heart","Her earlier books were so nimble, and her love and passion of forensic science and discovery made the pages fly. But this book, and the last Scarpetta novel, were so heavy and dull! I wonder if the fault lies with the old adage that we become what we focus on. There is so much darkness in this that there is no thrill, and certainly no joy in discovery. The characters are so coarse and you don't even care if anyone is redeemed or redeemable; and that's just not real life. I couldn't even finish the book."
2,Disappointed/bored are understatements,"I am in the process of deciding if I want to continue reading Blowfly. Being a loyal Scarpetta fan, I feel I should read it. But there is not any incentive to continue to read this book. I'm about 100 pages into it, and will put it down if it doesn't pick up. Unlike in the other books, I really could not care less about the people or happenings in this book. In fact, I don't think I'd be missing anything if I put the book down forever. So, don't waste your money on purchasing the book, if you really must read it, get it from the library."
1,WTF,"I've just started reading the Scarpetta novels last month, going in order. When I opened the to the first page of this book I was confused. Then I thought well, this is just the preface. We'll get to the first person narration from Dr. Scarpetta in Chapter 2. Nope it was still 3rd person. I flipped through the book stopping in various spots to check if it was ""I"" , or ""We"" "" on the find ""He"" , ""She"" and ""They"". After 11 books written in 1st person, Cornwell changes to third person. That is not normal in a series. The whole tone of the book is different. I've not even finished it yet. Having a hard time getting into the grove with changing each charcters point of view each chapter and not know whats really going on with Dr. Scarpetta like the other previous novels. Hope the rest of the books in this series are not all written in third person. If so, I may have to give up on this series."
2,Caveat Emptor,"Clearly Blow Fly left a lot to be desired..........especially in light of the fact that the author is quite capable of delivering more to her readers. Rather than focusing on an authentic, scientific approach to the storyline, Ms. Cornwell uses her descriptive expertise to develop character after character - some of whom have little if any real role in the novel. In essence, the tedious nature of the latter leaves the reader unquestionably bored. Lending to that (and a BIG yawn here) is the disastrous manner in which she finalizes the story beginning with the ""Wolfman's"" jail break. If I wanted to read comic books, I would buy them. The incredulous events in her final pages leave one to ponder whether the author intended this novel for individuals who were challenged with exceptionally low IQs. Given her remarkable talent for writing, Blow Fly is definitely NOT her best effort. Sadly, it is an insult to the intelligence."
1,Upset,"I am upset at having wasted my time reading 465 pages. I had never read a Cornwell book and I don't think I ever will. Just as some of the other readers, I kept measuring the number of pages left and wondering how in the world the author was going to tie up all the loose ends in such a short time. Well...needless to say, she didn't...at least not for me. I literally threw the book in disgust when I finished the last page."
1,I feel for the trees that died for this,"I have read all of the Scarpetta novels & this book is beyond awful. I thought Cause of Death was the worst, but this one is worse.There are soooooo many things that make this bk. awful, but nada compares to the resurrection Of Benton. The whole fact that not only is he not dead, Marino & Lucy have know all along. Pleeeease!!! Scarpetta can't know he is alive cuz????? It's beyond ridiculous. But, then again so is Wolf-man escaping from death row down in Tx...I'm not sure why I continue to read the Scarpetta novels after this one - Maybe cuz I keep hoping 1 day Lucy will finally die."
1,What happened to this series?,"After reading my late mother's copies of UNNATURAL EXPOSURE and BODY FARM, I eagerly checked out Kay Scarpetta mysteries at my local library. Then I checked out BLOW FLY, even though some of the earlier entries weren't available at the time. The third person format was very dull. I quit long before the end. In fact, I didn't care enough to check the end of the book to see what happened."
1,What happened to the ending?,"I wholeheartedly agree with the previous posters. In fact, one review sums up my feelings exactly - ""When it finally did get going, toward the end, I kept looking at the number of pages left, wondering how it was possible that I was almost finished when there was obviously so much story unresolved."" I thought for sure there was a 'To be continued' in my near future. I was shocked when the answers were supposedly crammed into a few short pages. Did Ms. Cornwell run up against a deadline? The book definitely seemed like merely a segue to the next installment, which will hopefully be much more fulfilling."
1,One star too many,"All the celebrity must have gone to Patricia Cornwell's head. Not much planning went into this disaster. Here is a thought: Kay Scarpetta, get over yourself! Who would even want to be around this morose woman. I didn't care for (or like) any of the characters. What scares me is that the Wolfman is poised for yet another return. YIKES! Badly written, no ending and characters with dead personalities. Amen."
1,Doesn't deserve even one star,"This collection of printed pages is not worth to be called a book. It is so bad that I have been permanently been put off reading Cornwell's stories.It is sad, but she was one great tale teller, riveting even, at certain key points. Here is a flow of words splashed together; there is no cohesion, there is no real story just endless blather.Oh, what happened to you, Ms Cornwell? You were such a fine raconteur.The one star is the result of having to rate it at least with that pesky (and here worthless) one star."
2,MY DISAPPOINTMENT BROUGHT ME TO TEARS,I waited anxiously for this book and ordered it in advance. I was so disappointed. I am so used to Kay Scarpetta telling the story in the first person that reading the story in the third person gave me the eerie feeling that someone else wrote Blow Fly. There was just too much effort explaining the past that I became weary reading it. When reading the other Cornwell novels I just flew through them because the story was so engaging and interesting. I found myself with this book scanning ahead hoping it would get better. I had a bit of difficulty dealing with inconsistencies in this book compared with events in Black Notice and The Last Precinct. I find myself unrealistically wishing that the author would rewrite it in her usual style so I could believe I haven't wasted my money or lost confidence in her as a writer.
2,What's happened to Patricia Cornwell?,"Yikes! I ussed to rush right out and buy the hardback copy of each new Patricia Cornwell novel, but I'm certainly glad I obtained ""Blow Fly"" from the library. Cornwell's writing has definitely gone downhill right along with Scarpetta's career. My first clue was that this book, unlike every other Scarpetta novel, was written in third person -- not from Scarpetta's point of view. I guess this is because she's not actually IN the plot quite a bit of the time. At any rate, it seems like Cornwell is grasping at straws -- right up to the ""let's bring someone back from the dead"" moment. These used to be great police/forensic procedurals with interesting repeating characters. Now the Scarpetta books are full of paranoia and long, drawn-out character descriptions. While I was glad to read this latest installment just to satisfy my curiosity, I'm glad I didn't pay for it!"
1,Oh Dear ! ! !,"I have been a Patricia Cornwall fan since I read her first book Post-mortem, which I borrowed of my Aunt at the age of 13. I have waited in anticipation for each of the new Scarpetta novels, this was no exception. I asked for the book as a Christmas present, and as I had just given birth to my first child, I was saving it to read once I had gotten used to my new job of motherhood.I was so disappointed, I struggled to read the book, I thought that motherhood had muddled my mind, so I read it again. It's worse the second time round. I must admit that I will buy the next Scarpetta novel Trace when it is released... But only because I am intrigued to know if could really be that bad again.. I guess it could have been worse Benton could have come back in the shower ..."
1,Where is the suspense?,"I am a big fan of Patricia Cornwell's and have read every book in the Kay Scarpetta series. Blowfly was a christmas present. As I read it, I just kept waiting and waiting for it to get better. It never did. I was so puzzled by the ending, there was no suspense at all!It seemed to me that this book's purpose was simply to set up the scenario for the next one.Bad news, wolfman is on the loose and unfortunately that will require one more book to put him to rest.I also would favor a brand new case in the next book, with maybe only one paragraph devoted to wolfman, mentioning that Kay gets a phone call from a long time associate to let her know that a man covered with baby fine hair was found, bled to death, having mistakenly bit off his tongue while looking at a picture of Kay.And that's it, bury him and move on!"
1,Englishteachersnightmare,"Judging by the number of typos and missed grammaticals, even Cornwell's editors couldn't bring themselves to actually read the thing. Too much talk about the past with very little action bearing on the story. New characters are too thin. I've read better ""How I Spent My Summer Vacation"" essays. Didn't someone notice there was no ending? It just stopped. Be glad to relax with a real Cornwell novel. Get this girl an editor!!"
1,Scarpetta Fan- but awful ending,"Read the book in two days. Was really enjoying it until about 2/3rds of the way through. For those who have read it, I still don't understand why Benton was sending those letters??? It is like she took a hatchet and just zap- finished the book without reaching closure on a number of the story lines. Very disappointing. I agree with other readers-- let's move on to some new criminals."
2,Let down,This was one of the first Cornwell books that falls flat. It is poorly written and not the quality that we have come to expect from Ms. Cornwell. The story line is not well developed. The chapters are short and dis-jointed. The ending doesn't end. You get the feeling Ms. Cornwell was under a publisher's deadline and rushed (with disasterous results) to complete a novel that was only a partial rough draft. Greatly disappointed.
1,A Grave Disappointment,"Sadly, the negative reviews are justified; Cornwell's latest in the Scarpetta series remains a grave disappointment. Essential scenes (which I cannot divulge here in repect to those who have not yet read this book) are given short shrift while less important scenes are highlighted. At times, Scarpetta appears as bloodless as the cadavers which she examines! Indeed, much of the novel does not ring true--it is as if those characters that we have come to know and enjoy reading about have de-evolved into caricatures. It is truly a shame because Cornwell is a first- rate writer. Perhaps her next book will help shed some light on the myriad of questions that Blow Fly leaves unanswered (along with this reader scratching her head in bewilderment)."
2,Blow Fly,"Patricia Cornwell? tell me it's not so. This book was hard to follow and Patricia must not have put much time in writing this story at all. You might want to read it just to keep up with her next book, which I hope will have more time in the writing.Larry Hobson-Author ""The Day Of The Rose"""
2,Well Corny,"It seems as though Patricia Cornwell has not spent the last three years creating credible new storylines for her best - loved character. Benton's re-emergence was explored previously and his role should have been laid to rest.This novel was disappointing, lacking in the vivid characterisation deployed in the author's previous works and its denouement was hurried and unsatisfactory.The horrific Jay Talley met his maker far too simply and the reader is left with the feeling that Cornwell has lost her conviction with regard to the superb plotlines and characters for which she is celebrated."
1,Where is the ending?,"This book was very disjointed, more so than her past books. It has been three years since we read of Scarpetta, and yet we are supposed to remember everything. Up until the last few pages I would have rated it a lot better but Where is the ending? I have never seen a worst end to a book. There should have been mucho chapters to go. I guess we will have to wait another THREE YEARS to hear from Scarpetta and of course we all know the plot line. Get a grip and write like you used to, PC. And drop the other series, it stinks even worse than this one. I swore I was not going to read her anymore. I should have kept my promise!"
1,it SUCKED,"This was one of the most self indulgent pieces of garbage i have ever suffered through. her reputation is shattered!. previous novels were excellent (except the Andy Brazil series) but even in the last couple, Cornwell's ego started to dominate her good judgement. this book is filled with needless ego boosts for the characters and the author. it appears cornwell was either intoxicated or lazy. either way do not pick up this book and pray that her editor gets the guts to tell her to clean up her act before she tries writing again. the story was also absolutely incredulous and read more like James Bond. Unfortunately Kathy Reichs will be left to dominate the Genre until Cornwell finds her marbles!"
1,The Worst!,"Simply put, this is one of the worst books I have ever read. Hands down!I was looking foward to a new Scarpetta novel - but this? The plot is contrived, the characters unrecognizable, the book goes off in so many different directions.By the time I reached the end, I just didn't care anyore. Don't waste your time and money on this book!"
1,"I am sad. I miss my friends, Kay, Marino and even Lucy","I made a mistake. I said I would not buy any more of Patricia Cornwell's books. But I did. It was an error.This book is awful. I am over halfway through and I do not think I can finish it. In many, many years of reading I can count on my fingers the number of books that I have started and have chosen not to finish.It is a shame. Patricia Cornwell is one of the most talented and engaging writers I have ever read. I would put her up there with John D. MacDonald, Faye Kellerman, and better than Jonathan Kellerman. But not now. It is as though only part of her is writing. You can still see the talent in her work, only it is not being used anymore. It just sort of sits there. In the past when she was cooking the talent was hidden the way it is supposed to be.Do not buy this book. If you have not read them buy any of her first ten Kay Scarpetta books. They are excellent. There you will meet some interesting people. Here you will find only regret"
2,Disappointed!,"I have always been a fan of the Kay Scarpetta series and bought this book, expecting and hoping for a better read than the last few books Ms. Cornwell has written. I can only say I was really disappointed. I was expecting a Scarpetta mystery in line with the earlier ones and this one doesn't even come close. Written in the third-person, it seems impersonal and not even about the Scarpetta I used to love.Maybe it's me, but this book (along with some of her latest ones)reads like it wasn't even written by Patricia Cornwell. At least, not the author who gave us the earlier installments in this series. I'm beginning to wonder if she isn't following in the steps of James Patterson - simply placing her name on a mediocre book written by someone else."
1,Blow by this book!,"This is the worst Patricia Cornwell book I've ever read! It jumps from one thing to the next and is very hard to follow. I think Ms Cornwell has spend too much time running after Jack the Ripper and trying to find out who killed Princess Diana, and NOT enough time on this book."
2,Blow Fly,"This is a boring book. Using Kay Scarpetta as an attention grabber isn't fair! I loved all Cornwell's forensic novels but this one is rehashing previous books. Hopefully, there is a story in there somewhere! No forensics yet and I'm halfway thru. It is a struggle to finish! Wish I didn't waste my $$."
2,Patricia Cornwell are you sure?,"I waited for ages for this book, I have always prefered the Scarpetta novels. But the writing didn't even read like Cornwell. I think Kay was called Kay maybe 5 times in the whole book. Lucy needs to find a good woman and settle down, what happened to Janet? Benton back from the dead? I'm not sure that it would be possible for Lucy or Marino to lie for that long to Kay.It didn't feel like a Scarpetta novel and it didn't read like one either. That being said the stage is nicely set for the next book which I hope goes better. Although I find myself missing the days of Temple Gault."
2,"Starts with a roar, ends with a whimper...","I became addicted to the Scarpetta series and devoured every one. Sad to say, this one gave me a bit of indigestion. Ms. Cornwell, what have you done to our beloved characters? Marino was always an out of shape slob, but we knew he was the best at what he did. In this book, we only got the slob. And Lucy! There was finally a strong, beautiful character who happened to be a lesbian. What happened? Her sexuality was one of the things that seemed to make Lucy who she was. And remind me not to rob any banks with her; she spilled her guts within 24 hrs.Bringing Benton back to life sucked the life out of Scarpetta...she was strong, intelligent, and in charge, it seems, till she met him. All of a sudden she was the damsel in distress needing to be saved by the all encompassing male hero. Rudy, the human Ken doll, deserves no mention. Never. Ever. Amen."
1,this novel is a travesty,"Patricia cornwell has gone round the bend or is just trying to get a big paycheck at her fan's expense. This not a novel but is more reminiscent of a 1930's serial. There is no focus and makes little sense. We are left waiting at the end for the next novel which should have a warning of ""to be continued."" I will never waste money on another of her books but still consider her novels such as All That Remains as one of the finest examples of contemporary mystery. She needs to get back to her form of ten years ago."
1,A dolorous ending for Dr. Kay,"I am not sure if it is because of the times we now live in or my own lack of hope for the future, but I could barely get through this book. The lengthy discussion of torture and death was excessive and I too found a loss of love for the main characters. Lucy is now a hired killer - it was just a annihilation of people I cared about. Very disappointing and it will be my last Kay Scarpetta read although perhaps not my last Cornwell read."
1,Save your money,This book was extremely disappointing.The story took a long time to unfold but it never really developed. This book is totally unlike the rest of the series.
2,Ack,"Well, this book completely threw me off. I've read almost every book Cornwell ever written, and I've always felt pretty confident in her vision of the Scrapetta series. This book however - what is this?! The characters seem to have the same names, but act totally unlike themselves. The Benton thing seems to come completely out of the blue, and reminds of a soap opera plot. New characters pop up and get pages and pages written about them, while Kay is barely mentioned. Lucy doesn't seem to be gay anymore. The psycho killers are conveniently explained, their psychological damage is easy to figure out, since they seem to be written as if the writer followed a text book. The language is crude. I just couldn't bring myself to care about any of the things happening and the plot seemed rather ridiculous. Never thought I'll find myself regretting spending money on one of Cornwell's books, as I've always considered her to be a gifted and talented writer. Go figure."
2,Did Patricia get sick of writing?,"I loved all of the books in the Scarpetta series, but I think Patricia Cornwell has gotten sick of writing her. Blowfly hits a new low, with a build up to nothing. The ending reads like she got tired of the book and decided just to end it without explaining anything. Her books have been on the downward spiral since she killed off Benton in Point of Origin, and it just keeps going down."
2,Dead on Arrival,"Patricia Cornwell's Blow doesnt make you fly.Blow Fly could have been the best one she has written in a long time, she tries out a different writting style and the new style works well for the first two thirds of thebook, then it sort of switches back and forth between her ""normal"" writing style and the ""experimental"" new style. Then her publisher must have told her""Your deadline is due next week, wrap it up!"" because the concluding chapter is the poorest she has ever done, it really sucks.So it starts out a great read but stumbles into a terrible letdown at the end.I would recommend ""Read it for a lark, but borrow it ... dont buy it.""Marty"
2,Getting Stale (includes spoilers),"After her last novel about Kay, etc. (The Last Precinct) I came to expect that this would be a follow-up to tie up loose ends. What a disappointment! Patricia Cornwell seems to be coasting on her success with the previous books in the Scarpetta series, and I found this book very different. Switching from 1st to 3rd person was the very least of the transgressions. I mean, come on! Kay was exonerated of Diane Bray's murder, yet she's hiding out in Florida like a hunted animal? Benton Wesley is actually alive. Lucy has a boyfriend! The chemistry between Kay and Pete Marino was in that he DIDN'T admit his feelings for her. And are we destined to be tortured with redundant references to Chandonne forever like with Carrie Grethen? My suggestion to readers is that, rather than wasting money to buy this book, borrow or check it out from the library."
2,--Scarpetta's lost her charisma--,"BLOW FLY was not my favorite of Patricia Cornwell's books.This story continues with the life of Dr. Kay Scarpetta, who in the earlier books, had been the Chief Medical Examiner in Richmond, Virginia. Now, Kay seems somewhat adrift as she is living in Florida, and works as a private forensic consultant. She's asked to look into a case in Louisiana, and finds that a killer that she had met in the past, may again be resuming his life of destruction. Scarpetta's comrades, Detective Pete Merino and her niece Lucy both take an active part in this book, but like Kay Scarpetta, they lack luster. All of the characters seem to be showing the dark and unlikable traits in their personalities.Starting with the book's title, I found the entire story to be disconcerting and distasteful,"
2,Too abrupt an ending - - what happened?,"As an avid reader of Patricia Cornwell's books, I was so looking forward to this, her latest. The book was pure Cornwell, up until the last chapter, where she abruptly ended it, leaving me to wonder if she finished her required number of words for the publisher and felt no need to continue. Come on, Patricia, and respect your readers. Return to your wonderful style of writing which catches up the reader and pulls them along until the end of the story. Don't just shove us off the cliff (or down into the cellar)."
1,Don't bother,"I have read every one of Patricia Cornwell's books and would proudly list her as one of my favorite authors until Blow Fly. This was one of the worst books I have ever read and I was so disappointed in the writing and story that I could barely finish it.I'm not sure why but Cornwell seems to be more into writing about everyone's sex lives than writing a story with something of a plot. Truly, this was so bad that when I finished, a stranger came up and asked how the book was and I told him it was so awful that he could have it."
2,almost better,"cornwells past few scarpetta novels have been lackluster, mundane, in short boring....with blow fly we see the return of some of the pacing and characterization that made her early books so successful.....on the negative side the ending leaves alot ALOT to be desiredand far too many dangling plot threads......for the next scarpetta novel let's see the tale of one of her first cases, because it's starting to feel like i'm reading about my grandmother"
1,BLOW FISH,"I was a big fan of Cornwell and her ficticional character, Scarpetta. But the plot, constance referances to previous books and the ending of this book, BLOW FLY ,left me in limbo. I hope the next book will be more intriging and enjoyable."
1,You must be joking!,"This book was a huge disappointment. I tentatively forgave the author after picking up Isle of Dogs in an airport bookstore. What garbage that was. Almost killed my fan status for good.I echo the previous, negative comments. Scarpetta was missing much of the novel and the characters behaved in an inanely, scripted manner and were completely unbelievable. The conclusion was laughable.Oh, and one last question in my mind: if Benton had to ""hide"" from the evil Chandonnes...how is he so ""free"" now that a few of the dirty members are dead? Seems like big daddy's still around and he was supposedly the one to fear, right? Ridiculous! This book is drivel."
1,Give me my money back,This book is simply awful. I have been a fan of this series from the beginning and so eager to read the latest I indulge in getting the hard cover as soon as it is available. Everyone involved in putting this one out should be ashamed.
1,Disappointed,"A downward spiraling trend....sadly. After much anticipation this book was a bitter disappointment to me. I feel PC had to scramble for ideas just to complete the book. And the conspiracy theory, I mean, come on. I don't mind stretching my imagination for the sake of fiction, but this was beyond 'stretching'. It was good to have familiar characters back (even if they did act out of character) but at what price? Let's hope PC will take a page from the old Dallas TV series and this will 'all be a dream' and we can get back to the Kay Scarpetta that we know and love."
1,Not what I expected......,"Being an avid fan of Patricia Cornwell, I was looking forward to curling up with this book for an exciting read. Unfortunately, so much of the book was reminding me of all the happenings in the books I've already read, that I was surprised to be almost to the end without ever having gotten to the juicy mystery I was expecting. I'm hoping the next book gets us back into the forensic science and mystery solving I've come to enjoy from the Kay Scarpetta novels."
2,Blow Blow Blow,"Uffda, I've been an ardent follower of Ms. Patsy Cornwell, and I believe this book has fallen short of her standard. I began believing that this was a book about Kay Scarpetta, ace forensic pathologist, but it isn't. It is about a bunch of unfinished business. Unfortunately the loose ends aren't tied-up all that convincingly.I guess I have learned to expect more from Ms. Cornwell. I still look forward to her next book, but please let's not have another stinker like Blow Fly?!"
1,The last Cornwell book I will ever buy,"I use to really like Patricia Cornwell's books, and I would always look forward to the next one. Then came Hornet's Nest. I think I would rate that the worst book I have ever read. After that book I only bought the Scarpetta books. I thought the quality deteriorated somewhat, but they were still worth reading. Then came Blow Fly. In my mind this book is almost as bad as Hornet's Nest. The characters in Blow Fly are totally unbelievable and (with the possible exception of Nic Robillard, a minor character) completely unsympathetic. The story did not flow well. Resurrecting previously killed off characters made the book even more absurd. I felt compelled to finish the book only because I had bought it. If I had taken it from a library I would have returned it unfinished."
2,Who are these people?,"As most Patricia Cornwell fans I was excited to learn a new Kay Scarpetta novel was being released. I have read the book and I am extremely disappointed. The two questions I had throughout the book were ""who are these people?"" and ""who wrote this book?"". The book is written in third person unlike all the others and the characters have lost all ""human"" qualities. I must be honest...I did not like any of these characters! I'm sorry Ms. Cornwell...I won't be reading another ""Scarpetta"" novel."
1,Average customer rating based on 42 reviews = 2.73 Stars!!,"As a result of the Amazon average rating of FIVE stars I went to the trouble of counting the total stars awarded by 42 customers, and came up with an average of 2.73 stars!! (And that includes the five star ratings by ""I haven't read the book yet, but I am such a PC fan..."" customers)Certainly a more telling rating concerning ""Blowfly"" than what the Amazon rating suggests. Makes you wonder..."
1,Not a real Scarpetta novel,"This is the most dissapointing Scarpetta novel I ever read, mainly because Scarpetta is missing througout most of the book.The switch to third-person narrative doesn't allow you to feel like you go through the emotions with the characters, but instead make you feel like an outsider.The worst part of it, is the thought of another book with Jean-Baptiste Chandonne in it, since by the end of the book he is still on the loose. After three books where he has played a big part, I am getting tired of him, and need a new villain."
1,Very disappointed,I have read all of Cromwells books and enjoyed most of them. When I started reading BlowFly I kept wondering Where is Scarpetta? It was about everyone but her but as the book went along I thought is this even a Cromwell Book? I was just a complilation of disjointed chapters and I felt that Cromwell got bored with it too and just decided to end it. The tormented Benton-give me a break and Jean-Baptiste breaking out of prison blind then walking off with the car keys-To do What? Drive? I can't wait to read how she explains that in the next book. I couldn't believe she didn't address that part of the plot-what is he the Road runner? And when he's sitting waiting for her to visit him he's drinking and eating the cupcake pretending that he doesn't know she's there. How on earth does he know being blind and behind glass? Just STUPID PATRICIA YOU'RE SO MUCH BETTER THAN THIS! I forced myself to finish this book KNOWING that it would get better and it just got WORSE.
2,I'm going to be generous.,"I'm going to assume that PC was experimenting with a different style of writing, trying to stretch herself, if you will; trying to relieve her own boredom and give her characters new and different life.If so, it failed as badly as some flunked-out high-school jock's chemistry experiment. I'm giving her 2 stars for the benefit of the doubt, but basically, every negative criticism people have levied at it here is accurate.Do not waste your time."
4,Fun!!,"I'm not sure why there are so many bad reviews for this book. I enjoyed it immensely. I couldn't put it down. I've really become involved in the characters in this series & can't wait to see what they're going to do next. Yes, it's formulaic. Yes, some of it is implausible. No, it's not the Great American Novel. Who cares? That's not the point. The point is that it's fun and it's suspenseful. Lighten up!"
2,Disappointed in Cornwell,"I am a big fan of Patricia Cornwell, but this is the worst Scarpetti book that she's written. I usually can't put the book down--but it took alot longer to read this one. Scarpetti is tough and also human, but it just wasn't the Scarpetti that I know & love. Events brought her to the bottom, but she's one tough lady and this book didn't even sound like her. I was very disappointed and I hope the next one brings back the real Kay Scarpetti."
3,Well ...,"This one definitely isn't the best of the bunch, but it's still readable. I had been a bit put off with the fact that the previous book in this series was written in present tense (I can't stand that), and when I saw that this one was also written in present tense, I cringed again. Not only that, but it's written in 3rd person, which initially I didn't understand, but now realize was necessary for the story.It's not as fast-paced or exciting as the previous books, but it will definitely be necessary to have read it in order to keep up with the storyline of the next book (which I hope will be much better, in first person again, and written in past tense). I adore Patricia Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta series and am looking forward to the next one."
1,"Bad, Bad Blow Fly","I have read every Cornwell book written and was looking forward to reading Blow Fly. This book was a huge disappointment. Thankfully I got it from my library and didn't waste any money on it. It was written in the first person, which didn't work well. Each chapter was a different character - so it jumped around constantly. The plot was very weak. And the ending was so anti-climactic that she wrapped it up in the last 15 pages. It felt like she got sick of writing the book and just came up with whatever she could to end it. Maybe she was too busy researching Princess Diana's death for her TV appearance to spend much time on this book. It was definitely a half-hearted effort. If you're a staunch Cornwell fan, you'll read it - but don't waste your money on buying it - go to your library."
1,Re-read an older story....,"This is the last PC book I will buy in hardcover unless something changes. I have ready every PC book and while I felt the last couple of efforts were not up to par, I gave her the benefit of the doubt. Sadly, no more.Where to start? First, there is the distinct lack of a plot, plot twists, or any meaningful mystery--the things that have been PC's hallmark. Instead, we get to spend time on the analyst's couch with each of their characters exploring their personal angst. This might be cool if this added greater depth to the characters, but it doesn't--its just a rehash of territory covered in previous books.Your time any money maybe better spent re-visting one of her earlier novels."
2,Not one of her best,"I've always enjoyed the Scarpetta books but this one was definitely not one of the best. The plot was somewhat predictable. Benton's being alive was actually not surprising, or even interesting.Patricia Cornwell has become a victim of her own success and has lost her originality as she churns out boiler-plate stories."
1,I should have read the reviews first...,"Okay so it wouldn't have made any difference. I loved Cornwell's writing and yes, even after her last 2 average novels, I was going to give her another chance. I'm only 1/2 way through the book and it's horrible. What happened to the snappy dialogue that we're used to?? I think I'll check her next novel out of the library instead of wasting good money on it."
1,Who wrote this?,"Patricia Cornwell simply could not have written this book. If she did, then she's totally out of touch with her characters and their behavior. From a long-time fan, I'm recommending that she stop this farce with a ghost writer and get back to basics. Add some science back in (all of which is appallingly lacking from this book) and bring the characters back to their roots. Both Lucy and Marino keeping things from Kay? I doubt it.Until I hear that Cornwell is back on target, I'm extremely happy that Kathy Reichs is keeping her Temperance Brennan series alive and well."
1,What happened here?,"This book is so unbelievably bad it's hard to believe Patricia Cornwell wrote it. None of the characters are recognizable from their former selves, for starters. The plot is beyond bizzare and contains some major holes. And we're expected to believe that escaping from death row of a max-security prison is relatively simple. The book is not written in first person as the other Scarpetta books are and is in a strange diction style that is hard to follow. Finally, it contains way too much blood and guts and gore. Yes, I know it's a murder mystery but some of it really seems gratuitous."
2,This Never Happened Before,"I rented this book on CD and was about halfway through when I drove by the rental outlet. Since nothing seemed to be going on plotwise for some time I just returned the darn thing and got something worthwhile (the new James Lee Burke, if you must know). I've read/heard every Scarpetta book, and once thought Cornwell was the absolute best. But as she seems to lose interest, so do I. This book refers to past adventures, which were a lot more interesting. It might be a better course to pick up ""Last Precinct"" or ""Black Notice,"" where she found a real rhythm. But this one leaves me cold."
2,Hard To Finish,"I thought maybe it was just me, maybe I didn't understand the book. As I read the other reviews here I can tell you- It's not JUST ME. This book was hard to finish, it wasn't as good as any of the other Kay Scarpetta novels. I am a die hard Cornwell fan, and have been waiting years along with the rest of you to get my hands on a new Scarpetta book. But what has Scarpetta come to? Everyone in this book is angry and depressed. Lucy is a killer, Marino leaves his home dejected and depressed, and Benton is back? How could Lucy and Marino hide this fact for so long? There are characters that just show up, like Rudy. What happened to Teun? And the ending, oh boy. After reading the whole book.. I won't give it away..but to have it wrapped up so quickly and easily didn't statisfy me. Hopefully the next Scarpetta book will be better!"
1,Couldn't even finish,"I was sorely disappointed. This was the first Scarpette book that I hadn't purchased sight unseen, due to my dislike of The Last Precinct. I checked this out of the library and I'm glad I didn't waste my money.The story is disjointed, jumping from place-to-place, one dislikable character to the next. I found myself reading and rereading pages of dialogue to try and understand what they were so angry or upset about. Marino is a patheticself-pitying whiner, Lucy is neurotic, and Wesley and Chandonne are just bizarre. Scarpetta, in spite of then book being ""A Scarpetta Novel"", is barely in the first 200 pages.I read about 300 pages and then decided I wasn't enjoying myself and wasting my time. This is the first book I've put down unfinished in years."
1,I can't believe I fell for this again,"Cornwell's last book sucked big time. Still, I bought this one thinking that Scarpetta would be her redeeming. Wrong. None of her characters are a) believeable or b) worth caring about. If I ever buy a Cornwell book again (and she used to be one of my favorites), it will be in paperback and after I've read every review on Amazon."
2,A Disappointment,"This is a confusing mish mash of a book that rarely made sense and did not cause you to invest in the characters, as we all have for many years. It's the only Scarpetta book that I had to force myself through and was glad when I finished."
1,Should have read the reviews first.....,All the negative reviews are right on the money. Boring book. No need to go into details...others have done that. I doubt I'll finish the book.HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT....looked forward to this book as did countless others. What a waste.
1,Not worth your time - a really BAD book!,"I agree that this was the worst book I have read in a very long time. Like other reviewers, I WAS a Cornwell fan, but not any longer. If anyone else had written this trash, it would have never been published. What a disappointment and a rip-off. No more of my time or money will go to Cornwell."
1,That's Enough,"Well this one did it for me. I've gone from ""I can't wait for Cornwell's next book"" to ""never again wanting to read about characters like these."" I can definitely do without any more reprise of the twin, sicko, Chandonne brothers who, among other things in this butchered novel, take pleasure in using a woman's severed arm for alligator bait. Worse yet they may may never actually die--Cornwell has one of her characters actually return from being convincingly killed in a previous novel! I think Cornwell's extensive research for her recent Jack the Ripper book has taken a toll on what used to be one of my favorite authors. She seems to want to depict men as capable of being even more hideous than ever rather than writing an entertaining thriller."
1,This Blow Fly Blew - One Star is too gracious,"Over the past 3 months I have read all the Scarpetta novels and have watched them go from great to grave. Throughout the novels Scarpetta becomes more and more unlikeable - a snob rather than a caring human being who is more wrapped up in her home, Persian rugs (who cares if they are machine woven?), plus, if she really finds Marino such a repulsive human being, than why does she frantically call him every time she is followed or there is a loud noise outside? I'm just glad I took these books out from the library ~ I feel for those who have purchased these books - especially in hardcover."
1,Blow Fly: A Scarpetta Novel,"I've been a big fan of the earlier Scarpetta novels---but what a disapointment this one was. It was like it wasn't even written by the same person. The revived bad guys were almost cartoonish, and the new charactors (which seemed to have more attention than Kate) were somewhat interesting, but never fully developed."
2,Okay But ended too fast,I liked the book except the Poland thing that was not right. However I do know that a lot of people who are kind of sick in the head all want to live to New Orleans. So that part was right on. I do think the ending was really lame we get a huge buildup and then all the sudden Bev and Jay Talley are gone and it was rushed. Way too rushed. All the other Kay novels have been great and most of us all really knew Benton never died. I do think Jean Babtise needs to be a goner new charachters. The Last Precinct could be a great new direction for new things with everyone together and new characters. I read this book in one sitting and the only reason it gets 2 stars and not more is because the ending blows.
2,Cornwell must be getting tired...,That is the only excuse I am come up to explain the total lack of effort put forth on this book. Having read all of her other books I was eager to get my hands on this one. Don't know now why I bothered. Boring!! If you must read it check it out from your local library don't waste the money buying it.
1,Time's up...you have 2 pages to end the book,"I have read every one of Cornwell's novels and like many, have looked forward to Kay's cleverness and medical sleuthing. Although I did enjoy the twists and turns as the novel progressed, the ending was so amateurish, clipped, and unsatisfying that one has to wonder whether there was a reason for the shabby and uncreative way the author ties up all the loose ends. Did the publisher give her an ultimatum for a deadline and she had to somehow finish the book in a few days? How can the author deny the reader that inevitable confrontation between the good and evil forces? Extremely poor job done writing the climax. Viagra anyone?"
2,Scarpetta Running on Fumes -- Weak Effort By Cornwell,"It seems like the Kay Scarpetta series is losing steam. The motivations of the main characters, Scarpetta, her niece, and the rest of the gang, seem to all have one last twist in them, but the plot really doesn't hold together well.It is hard to keep a series going with the same basic characters and keep it interesting, but it seems like Cornwell has run out of ideas and is going through her files to churn out a few more books.I'm glad the book was in a remainder bin. Read the earlier efforts in the Scarpetta series instead."
1,Blow Flies Have Already Finished With This One,"I'm only half way through the book, but it is bad. Cornwell really rips off her faithful following with this pile of bull. Living in LA, and on the bayou, it reads like a very poor travel-log. Now we have Nic added to the characters, and no more development so far of the previous characters. BENTON LIVES! ... wow! ... now Cornwell is turning to the soap opera genre. I'm sorry I already bought ""Trace"" ... I guess I'll have to read it, but this time the reader is on trial, not the criminal."
2,blown,"I am an avid admirer of Cornwell's books and just completed Blow Fly and was blown away with the lack luster content. I sure hope the next Scarpetta novel is a 5 star because this one seemed rushed, harried and scattered."
3,what kind of ending was that?,"i almost stopped listening to this book after the first tape. i thought it was just going to be pratuitous psychopathology from start to finish. i persevered and it was good to have some loose ends tied up. but what the hell kind of ending was that? after all of that everyone just gets blown off in 5 minutes? and clearly we are gearing up for the saga to continue....perversely, i will read the next book, but really i was very dissappointed by the end of this one."
1,What a let-down!,"I patiently worked my way through the book, hoping that the other negative reviewers were wrong. Unfortunately, they were correct. And the ending... what a total let-down! Thank goodness I borrowed it from the library."
2,Did she run out of paper?,I had heard so much about Cornwell that I'm sorry that I picked this book as the first to read. I thought it hard to follow and had to go back and reread passages a couple of times to figure out what was being done to whom and then the bottom just dropped out at the end. Should I risk another book by Cornwell or move on?
1,Blown off by Blow Fly,"I thought Isle of Dogs was a dog, but this book really was a disappointment. I did not like the third person writing, and I missed the nerve-tingling excitement (frisson) that used to make me read a Cornwell novel in one sitting, even when my vision was very poor and reading was painful. Cornwell seems to be well motivated to contribute her resources to real world forensics;maybe that is the best use of her talent."
1,Disappointing,"I have read every one of Cornwell's books and I have never been disapointed until now. This book appears to have been written by committee!Cornwell over focuses on her character's emotions. By this time, the reader knows what drives them. All this angst is distracting and takes away from the plot. Her people are well fleshed out; now is the time to turn them loose and let them do their jobs.I had a difficult time following the plot. One chapter appears to be thrown in. I never understood why.The ending disapointed me the most. Rather than witnessing what happened, we are told what happened. Where's the fun in that?"
1,too much embalming fluid,"Pat has been to too many autopsies & smelled too much embalming fluid. She needs to take a deep breath, clear her brain and go back to her original story lines. No werewolves, no unfunny black humor."
1,Spoiled the fun,"I wanted to read this book, but the reviews here give so much away (Bentorn, etc..) that I have since lost interest. I will think twice before checking here again."
2,How not to end a book,I too was sad about this book. They last 50 pages seemed like a train wreck. The reviewer below who gave 5 stars says something about an evil nephew needs to reread it's son not nephew. I wish I hadn't bought it in hardback. Read it at the library.
1,BAD,"I AM ABOUT TO FINISH THE AUDIO VERSION OF BLOWFLY, I HAVE STUCK WITH IT, BUT ONLY BECAUSE I AM NO QUITTER. THIS BOOK HAS BEEN VERY DISSAPOINTING UNLESS YOU HATE GOD, AND LIKE TOTAL DISFUNCTION AROUND YOU! THE LANGUAGE IN THIS BOOK IS HORRIFIC AND UNNECESSARY! THE CHARACTERS ARE SO BORING, WITH KAY S. BEING PERFECT AND YET ANOTHER PSYCHOPATH WANTING TO OWN HER? HOW ABOUT A NEW PLOT??? LUCY IS UNREALISTIC AND OVER THE TOP, AND THE IDEA THAT BENTON WOULD STAY UNDERCOVER AND LET EVERYONE THINK HE IS DEAD FOR 6+ YEARS, NOT LIKELY!! ITS JUST A LAME PLOT, LAME CHARACTERS AND I WONT BE READING ANYMORE KAY SCARPETTA BOOKS UNTIL THE AUTHOR GETS BACK TO THE WAY THEY USED TO BE WHEN SHE FIRST STARTED WITH KAY S., WITH REAL BELIEVABLE CHARACTERS!!"
1,When Cornwell stopped liking her characters,"The Last Precinct was probably her last good book. After that, she just stopped liking her characters and demeans them. Not even worth getting from the library. Even getting past the disgusting opening, it's boring. Too bad, her earlier books were worth collecting."
1,Blow Fly - a real annoyance,"I haven't finished this pathetic tale yet, but when I have this opinion of what I am reading I like to check other reviews. I see the majority feel the same. There isn't anything new in this book, just a retelling of all the characters pasts and their connections to each other. Someone said the characters had changed so much they were unrecognizable. I don't agree, expecially Marino, if anything is has become more gross, in looks and behavior. Who'd put up with a boorish slob like that anyway. I really don't think I need to finish this disgusting, rambling story as the ending sounds to be anti-climatic.Come on Ms Cornwell you are capable of better than this."
1,How did I get through this book?,"I have tried another book in the Scarpetta series and left it half way unread, it was boring.But I decided to give it another shot.I agree with a lot of other reviews on here that this one is just as bad.I do wish that Kay would please get over herself. Boo hoo, she put all of her stuff in storage and now wants to live poor.Why? Is it because of her ex or ugly man?And Lucy, I am sick of her.But I found myself really disliking all of the characters.They are either whining, spoiled, severely depressed or super human.And why are the characters either extremely beautiful or horrendous looking? Couldn't there be an in-between?And is Lucy(can't stand that name) a lesbian or not? Wish she would make up her mind.kay scarpett"
1,What Happened?,"I really enjoyed the first several Scarpetta novels, but this switch from first to third person is absolutely detrimental to the series. We lose all insight into Scarpetta's mind. The bouncing around between characters is distracting, and I don't like where the series is going at all.I am also slightly biased because I think authors that base their main character on themselves (or who they wish they were) are ridiculous and lack imagination."
1,Horrible,"I had read some of Cornwell's early work and enjoyed it. When I found this in a vacation house, I decided to give it a shot. It is simply a horrible book. The characters are angst-ridden in ways that makes you dislike them. The plot moves slowly and the chapters jump from place to place and character to character so there is no continuity. Every 5-10 pages I would get exasperated and put the book down. The only new characters, Nic and Lanier, are so poorly developed that it's unclear why they are included in the book at all. They add nothing to the plot. The details describing weapons and cars are excruciatingly boring. And, as many of the other reviewers say, the ending is ridiculously abrupt and unsatisfying. After more than 400 pages of build-up, we are just told in a few words that the major villain has been killed, ""off-camera"": no drama, no final moments facing the heroes. As in the review title: horrible. Do not buy. Do not read. Do not get from library. Run away."
1,"""Blowfly"" blows.....","When this book came out, I grabbed it up expecting another fast and furious ride with Kay and Company. Instead I get a load of gratuitous sex of the saddest kind, bumbling ""investigators"", a stumbling plot line (I'm being kind here). Hideous, heinous, horrible.... you get the point, dear reader.I really didn't think this author could make a misstep, boy was I WRONG. Hope she gets her act together... a mind like hers is a terrible thing to waste.I've waited a while before indulging in my favorite detective's world, hope it's straightened out and Kay is once again on top of her game."
4,I thought it was good,"I enjoyed Blow Fly. I know the perspective was different, but I thought it allowed the author to be able to step out from the characters and look on them from above. Thus, allowing for much more richness in the character development."
1,"I persevered, but....","I can't believe I actually wasted several hours reading this book, nor that it was ever published in this state. It just doesn't make sense! I initially thought it was because it was so long since I read the last of the Scarpetta novels, and so had forgotten about the ruddy Chandonne family, Benton's death, etc, but by the end I realised that there were holes in the plot holes. Loose threads unravel throughout the novel, promising serial killer storylines just peter out, the characters that we know and love do completely random things, and the ending was just carnage. I actually came to read these reviews to see if it was just me being monumentally slow, but it looks like Cornwell's managed to baffle and bore most of us."
1,Awful,"I religiously read Cornwell's first half-dozen novels, when her stories (""The Body Farm"", etc.) were fresh, carefully crafted, and innovative. That was a long time ago. I got turned off as the series became sloppy and autobiographical, but I decided to pick this one up to see if the books have regained their form. They haven't. This is awful, sloppy, unfinished, and uninteresting. There are so many wonderful crime novelists out there, no reason to read second-rate books."
1,"awful, absolutely awful","I suggest that Cornwell go back and read her earlier works to remind herself how to write. Her writing in Blow Fly was atrocious. Poorly developed characters; the sappy, unbelievable and unnecessary resurrection of Wesley Benton; and a copped-out ending. Honestly, what was up with that ending? Why did PC think her readers deserved a denouement that consists basically of Benton telling Scarpetta: Don't worry all the bad guys are dead. oh, except the hairy guy; he's still around somewhere. let's go drink wine and be brilliant together."
1,"Disappointed, then Angry","This book is not simply a matter of the author not reproducing some of her early triumphs. The book's ending is so bad that I wondered whether the author just finished it off one night and whether a self-respecting editor ever saw the piece. The book as a whole was disappointing, due in part to a peculiar style that sometimes seems more like the brief notes that outline a book to be written, rather than the book itself, and partly because of the increasingly unsympathetic characters. Marino contributes nothing, but drinks a lot. The Benton character is absurb. Lucy's actions suggest that she has ""lost it"" in her darkness. And Scarpetta is often discussed from afar. Then come the last pages. I cannot remember another book that was concluded so poorly. What seemed disappointing ended up making me bad, because I felt that I had been cheated out of the book for which I had paid."
1,ABSOLUTLEY AWFUL !,"I have long been a huge fan of Patricia Cornwell. I love Cornwell's writing style, with her trademark ability of bringing scenes and characters alive with an abundance of meticulous detail. But the writing in Blowfly is noticeably different and awful -- choppy, sloppy and painfully lacking the delicious attention to detail that filled her previous efforts. It seems like the book was published while still a draft, or even -- dare I say it -- written by a lesser-talented ghost-writer. Cornwell herself couldn't have simply lost her talent, so I can only conclude that she has lost interest in creating art and is just hustling books to print for the paycheck. What a disappointment!"
2,What a letdown....,"I can't believe this book was written by the same author that brought us PostMortem and the wonderful character of Kay Scarpetta. The author has turned her into a minor character in her own series! The plot skipped around entirely too much to keep my attention. The Chandonne characters are tired and old, and I dread their inevitable return in the next book. The plot twists, such as they were, I found to be very uninspired. Still, I feel there are enough crumbs left in the series to make a comeback in the next installment....the author needs to return to her earlier installments to reintroduce herself to her own characters...she has been away from them too long, and it shows. I will read the next installment, but I will not buy it."
3,Not the usual Scarpetta novel,"This book is written in third person, which is different from her other books. This takes a little getting used to, but was an interesting change of pace. I enjoyed reading it, but it did not flow as well as her other books. The ending was way to rushed. I am left with a lot of questions that should have been answered at the end of the book. Let's move on from the Chandonnes already."
4,Another Page Turner,"Sure, the 3rd person point of view really threw me off at first and the constant reference to Kay as ""Scarpetta"" seemed cold, but this was another good page turner by Patricia Cornwell. It's great to get to know the other characters who are so important to these stories. The references to the past were necessary. Sure, people may not want to read about it all the time, but the past is what shapes us and, realistically, people do dwell a lot. It's amazing how everything intertwines and you're left feeling 'oh wow!' rather than 'duh, saw that coming 2 books ago'. I can't wait for the next installment. I hope it's soon!"
1,this Blows...,"This is one of the worst books I have ever read. No joke. I'm a big Scarpetta fan, but this book is incoherent, inconsistent, and frankly incomprehensible. The characters we've grown to know so well don't even sound like themselves here, and are making choices that are completely out of character. Plot lines are either completely unbelievable (arms on gator hooks??) or mundane (I should care about Rocco Marino's death? Everyone's always talked about what a creep he is!).Save your money."
2,What's happenned with character development ?,"I adore these novels. I think Patrica Cornwell is a talented and gifted writer. I also think Blow Fly is the first of the series that seemed written in a fog - in a hurry. It feels in a way that Scarpetta is more nuisance than Ms Cornwell's literary muse.I found the re-introduction of Benton - while certainly not surprising given the attention given his character in The Last Precinct - was placed in the book in a manner that we readers would feel grateful just for his return - and that ""shock"" would get us through a book in which the characters - -even though they are well travelled and well honed - seemed entirely one dimensional.Now all that said, I of course look forward to the next in the series - but only if Ms. Cornwell can re-emerge with a more fullsome and compelling Scarpetta and Co."
3,Quick ending,"I have just finished Blow Fly by Cornwell. It kept me turning the pages. I was amazed at how well it was flowing and how I could visualize this book in movie format but the ending was quick and a lot of issues unresolved, I assume so we'll buy the next book, which I will. Hopefully, her and Benson can have more time to sort things out in the next book....?"
1,Gibson,"I used to be a fan of the Patricia Cornwell, but her last few books have been very disappointing. This book is the WORST. I did not even bother to finish it.. I only gave it one star since that is as low as you can go. If I had the option, I would give if NEGATIVE stars. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. I was glad she was getting back to the Scarpetta novel series, but this was a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. I am a fan no longer."
3,Disappointed...,"I must say I was very disappointed in this book. Usually I can't put one of Cornwell's book down to save my life. This time, I had to force myself to pick the book up each day and continue reading. Most of the action happens in the last chapter or two, the rest of the book was slow. It's almost as if this book wasn't Cornwell's work. While it won't prevent me from being an avid fan of hers, I'm still disappointed in the quality of this story."
2,Very disappointing,"I have been a Patricia Cornwell fan for years, but this book is a huge disappointment. It's an author's right to experiment with his or her style, but by going to a 3rd person narrative Cornwell ends up spending more time in the mind of a hairy serial killer than she does with Kay Scarpetta. And the aforementioned hairy killer and his brother have SO outlived their welcome in this series. Bring people back from the dead - I don't care - make one of your main characters (Lucy)an unstable freak - your call - but Ms. Cornwell, move on from the French twins, put Kay Scarpetta back in the driver's seat, and start fresh."
1,Where'd the ending go??,"Thankfully I got this in PB at a used bookstore. I was getting seriously irritated when I only had a few pages to go in the book, thinking there wasn't enough time to wrap this up so there was going to be ""To be continued......"" on the last page. How wrong I was. It took about three paragraphs to bring the book to a highly unsatisfactory ending. Think there's a few CHAPTERS missing!On top of that, all the characters are made unlikeable in this book. The reactions of Marino and Scarpetta to various events are so out of character I almost wonder if someone else wrote this book. Obviously, if you're a diehard fan, 681 negative reviews won't dissuade you from buying it anyway. ;-) But hopefully you'll get a cheap copy and read with really low expectations.....maybe then you won't be as disappointed as I was."
2,Have I missed something?,"I thought perhaps that my book was missing a last chapter until I read a few other reviews. What happened to Jean-Baptiste? Crime novels should tie up the endings. I got the feeling that the publishing deadline arrived before the book ended! I was enjoying the book up to the last 2 chapters - very odd to say the least. Was expecting some confrontation with Scarpetta and J-B.Having enjoyed most of Patricia Cornwell's previous books, (especially Jack the Ripper and Post Mortem) I found this one very disappointing."
1,Big Disappointment,"I had read the reviews on this site before getting the book mistakenly thinking that the book couldn't be all that bad. I was wrong. I have read all of PC's books and been a big fan for years however I couldn't stand this book. It was a complete waste of time. If you are reading this thinking, like I did, that such a gifted writer could not have failed on her latest attempt - believe me she did. Although I am starting to think, like others, that Ms. Cornwell couldn't have written such a terrible book. I am very disappointed. Don't buy it, borrow it, give it or check it out at the library. If is a waste of time too precious."
1,Shouldn't have bothered,"I gave up on the Scarpetta novels a couple of books ago, but my hairdresser gave me this so I got sucked in again. It was just awful: morose, depressing, characters were inconsistently or badly developed, pace way too slow until the ending when things resolved (and I use that word loosely) abruptly and with strange gaps. Where's the editor?"
2,BLOW FLY BOMBS,"At first I mildly intrigued that Cornwell decided to write this book from the perspectives of others. That way we could get inside what Lucy, Marino and Benton really thought. But as the book went on I came to realize: I miss Kay Scarpetta. She was hardly in the book and when she was... she didn't quite seem to be the Scarpetta that I came to know and love. Where did she go?The ending? I will not even go there... major major disappointment. I read the last sentence, turned the page and realized that was it. Ms. Cornwell could do better. I hope she does since I am a loyal reader and will be next reading Trace. Bring back the Kay Scarpetta we know!! PLEASE"
1,Disappointing waste of time!,"I just got done reading BLOWfly, and I have to say I am in shock over how disappointed I am. The end was by far the worst I have come across. I was about 10 pages from the finish and kept saying ""How on earth can this all end in a few pages?"". The characters had nothing to them, chapters seemed rushed and thown together. I have always loved the charcter Kay, but she has turned into such a boring whimp I dont know if I can stand reading another book about her. Save your time and money and reread an old Scarpetta book, you will enjoy it much more!"
1,Oops,"Oh gosh. Look at the time. Better end this thing quick. Let's see, can I tie all of the loose ends up in a few paragraphs? Will anyone care if I use a few sentences of dialog between two of the characters to replace all of the action overdue the reader?And as the reader: I wish I had quit Cornwell with that absurd Dog Island or whatever it was."
2,Blow Fly - A great disappointment,"I also was very disappointed with Blow Fly. It was disjointed and many of the plots made no sense or were never fully developed.I'm ok with bringing back the character that died off in the previous book, but why he pretended to die, how Lucy was involved, and how it related to the Wolfman's family was really confusing to me. The ending in the wine cellar made me wonder if pages were missing from my copy. I just didn't get it.And that sums up my feeling on Blow Fly...I just didn't get it. This one goes into the Goodwill bag immediately. No second read for me."
2,What Happened?,"What in the world happened? I love Kay and Cornwell's writing and have gotten many others interested. When I saw that there was a new book we all waited, reviews aside. The reviews were right on. I enjoyed the beginning and figured the recap was for those who were reading for the first time. I kept waiting for something to happen. The end was SO disappointing that I was checking to see if maybe I had missed some pages! DO NOT START WITH THIS BOOK to get into Kay and the rest of the cast.Skip this and pretend it never happened. Maybe a sequel would explain what she was trying to do???"
1,WHY? ~ A TOTAL ANTI CLIMAX...! WELL BELOW PAR..,"I agree with almost every post regarding this novel.Having read ALL of Patricia Cornwell's works this was a real dissapointment.The ending ~ from Chapters 122 to 124 were like a student hurring to finish an exam essay!I would have thought with a 3 year wait since 'The Last Precinct"", we would have not have been subjected to such a lack lustre ending.....The book itself was an average read ( up till Chapter 122 )as it tied all the well known characters together, however it ended so badly that I would advise anyone contemplating reading it to not waste their time....Miss Cornwell is this really the best you could do?...Please give your readers the respect they deserve.Andrew N ~ Australia"
1,Warning Scarpetta fans!,"I just finished ""Blow Fly"" and can't believe how awful this book was! I was bored through most of it with the incredible descriptions of computer intelligence and weaponry! There was no real plot here - it just rambled around and around. Wrapped up in a few pages at the end with lots left unfinished and I am not the least bit interested in the next book because it will have to wrap up all the lose ends that left this book most unsatisfying. What a disappointment for a Cornwell fan."
1,Not very craftsman like,I was dissapointed with the book. The home on the cover is the most craftsman like. The other homes are the same standard homes you see in other plan books. There is not much detail and no interior details at all.
1,"The cover looks good, but it's downhill from there.","I have always been an avid houseplan-looker, and recently I have become interested in Craftsman style homes. I hoped from the home pictured on the cover that the houses in this book would be inviting and intriguing. Well, the cover is about the only interesting home in this book. There aren't many craftsman qualities about these plans. For the most part, they're just plain ole houses."
3,"Should you ""stick"" with Stickley?","This book of craftsman inspired homes has plans in many square footage ranges and dimensions. I found the beginning overview of the craftsman tradition especially helpful as my husband and I begin to understand that our idea of a dream home involves many craftsman details.Some of the homes, especially the smaller ones, seemed more to have craftsman touches, rather than being ""truly craftsman."" If you're a hardcore craftsman devotee, ""stick"" to the Stickley books. But, if you're just beginning your craftsman search and you're not a purist, this book is priced well and may prove to be inspirational!Donna Eberly"
3,Unsure,"I have had my Motorola Razr for about 6 months and recently when I charge it, a message displays on the phone telling me to ""Insert SIM."" Sometimes, the phone will not charge unless I take the SIM card out. This is where I am unsure. I don't know if the phone is the problem or the card. At this point, I have just been dealing with it, but it is an annoyance."
1,Huh?,Amazon sent me this entirely at random when I purchased a Sprint EVDO data card. It's utterly useless to me. I don't own a GSM phone and wouldn't use AT&T if I did.
