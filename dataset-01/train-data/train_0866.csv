2,not even good airplane reading,"It's a great idea and I had high hopes, but these young writers need an editor - badly. Take a bad episode of ""Friends"" and then commit it to paper. If that isn't dreary enough, dilute it some more so that all the pithy quips are gone. You then have the basic technique of TND...They'll make a bundle with the book anyway. I hear it will be a movie. It might also make a good HBO series.I got it at a half-price bookstore for 12.50. I was going to save it for friends who need something to read on an airplane, but don't think I can recommend it even for that. I think I'll try to sell it today.I read the authors are working on another book. Wonderful, another team-written novel. what's next, a committee?"
2,I kept waiting to get to the part people liked,"Several people told me I had to read this book. They said it was funny and a great look at life among the rich. So my expectations were pre-set. I didn't find the book funny, I thought it was very sad."
1,Overrated,"This book is completely overrated. I bought it because it was getting great reviews from editors and magazines, plus the fact that it was supposed to be extremely funny. As I read through the book the more stereotypical it becomes and the jokes less amusing and even less funnier. The first few chapters are devoted to how rich this nanny's clients were and how awful they are to the help. Mrs.X is supposed to be a character that you love to hate but in fact she is just as bland and shallow as the nanny who narrates in the book. I found this book thoroughly unentertaining since it is gives horribly exagerrated accounts of the relationships between nannies, their employers and their wards. This one is guaranteed NOT to make you laugh."
2,Doesn't live up to the hype.,"This was OK for a quick beach read when I went on vacation, but I found myself just wanting to get it over with.I found the writing mediocre and a few annoying things, like:Most people didn't have real names, they were descriptive names and I felt that to be an insult to the readers intelligence.Cell phones are ringing like crazy in this book with unwanted calls, so people hide them. Newsflash: cell phones have ""off"" buttons. My last gripe is that the descriptions of what the 4 year old says is more advanced than a 4 year old.Not worth buying but if someone gives it to you and you're really, really bored...have fun."
4,Good book but with some nasty characters,"Nanny is sweet and loving and has a knack with children. However, the family that hires her is awful. Don't get me wrong, the little boy Nanny cares for is sweet. It's the parents that are the problem. They are wealthy, self-centered, and barely have anything to do with their son. To them, he is more of a status symbol than a human being.The mother spends her time shopping, getting manicures, and doing other self-servicing activities. She expects everyone to bend to her will and do whatever she wants whenever she wants. Anyone who dares to not totally rearrange their life to suit her whims is deemed a problem and unworthy of employment. The father spends almost no time with the family - too busy with his business and his mistress.You can't help wondering why Nanny stays or help feeling sad for the little boy."
4,Rings of truth,"Appalling treatment of a working nanny in Manhattan, told in a very humorous way.Humor. An enjoyable read, yet a sad ending that makes you think. Written by 2 former nannies."
3,Witty observations but no character development or plot,"I have very mixed feelings about this book. After reading the first couple of chapters I was raving about how clever the observations and style were. But by two thirds of the way through I wanted to stop reading. There were no plot twists and there was no character development--I kept waiting for something to happen, but it never did. In the story the main character is treated poorly, whines but does nothing about it, is treated poorly again and then complains some more. Over and over again. That is basically the book. It starts out with so much potential and then just fizzles into a frustrating repetitive disappointment."
5,You will love this book!,"I am constantly reading and rarely do I come across a book that I would so highly recommend. The brilliant satire and realistic characterizations are reminiscant of the best of Tom Wolfe. I haven't enjoyed a novel as much since ""Bonfire of the Vanities"". Get it, you will love it!"
1,"Blah, Blah, Blah","When I finished this book, I thought it was me. I was glad to see so many others at Amazon felt the same way. Before you spend money on this book, check out all the one-star reviews. Some disappointed readers have written very good critiques. Personally, I think that all the effort in this book went into the marketing. This was a very ""sellable"" idea. Apparently, however, not enough time and effort (and money?) was spent on plot development, characterization and editing. All in all, the story reminded me of a former co-worker who never stopped talking. It was blah, blah, blah all day. Every ten minutes or so, I listened to a sentence or two of her endless chatter and got the gist of what she was saying. Likewise, if you buy this book, you can read a paragraph...skip ten pages...read a paragraph...skip ten pages, etc. This book was a lot of blah, blah, blah. Don't waste your time and money on it."
4,Funny and engaging; great light reading,"This book describes the life of a young woman working as a ""part-time"" nanny while attending college in NYC. Her employers are the ultimate definition of ""rich dysfunctional,"" a couple who cares more for their high-class clothes and furniture than their adorable 4-year old son Grayer. But the main character (aptly named ""Nan,"" or Nanny), can't help but fall in love with Grayer, which causes her to quietly accept being treated as less than human by her employers. Although the behavior of the rich couple is so outlandish as to seem unbelievable, the authors spent years as nannies themselves in NYC, and the implication is that they encountered similar abhorable behavior and worse. However, Nanny's passive acceptance of her treatment by the couple is even more difficult to understand, to the point which it was frustrating to read. Despite this, I enjoyed this lighthearted book and would recommend it to anyone looking for a quick, easy, and enjoyable read."
2,"easy read, wrinkled prose","It's a quick read with some story line there. But Nanny seems to engage herself to the job on an unnecessary scope while readers kind of hope there would be more drama or story there, but disappointed. All in all, the prose is so puckery, so wrinkled, as if eating while hiccupping, language way too much vacuumed..."
4,true to life,"An deadly accurate picture of boorish NYC investment bankers and their shrill, desperate wives. What I did not find believable is that the nanny stayed so long and was such a doormat. I began disliking her after a while when most people would have spoke their mind and given notice."
2,Entertaining trashy fun,"As literature, this book is pretty thin. There are no three-dimensional characters, and nobody learns anything or changes.Nanny annoyed me for her spinelessness. Advice, Nanny: most of your problems could be solved if she would just act in a more businesslike way. If you want your clients to treat you like a professional, then act like one. Set clear terms for the job and stick to them. Set a per-diem fee in advance for the Nantucket trip and stick by it. And don't be afraid to walk away if the employers balk.Um, back to the book. As a fun way to spend your weekend, you could do worse. In truth, I could not put this book down, it was a wonderful distraction from *ahem* taking care of my own kids over a long Thanksgiving weekend. Add a star if you take care of young children, or if you love to poke fun at the foibles of rich people."
2,"Well...I Wouldn't Jump Straight To ""Diambolically Funny""!","This book was not as wonderful as or as funny as I thought it would be. I read the books before I read the reviews and I should have done just the opposite. I truly didn't find any humor in self centered parents, a 'willing to be a doormat nanny', or the spoiled but ultimatly ignored child Grayer. I must admit that I did finish the book only because I spent the money and didn't want to waste it, the authors took the time to write it, and someone in publishing felt it was worth publishing. Take my advice, borrow it from a friend, or the library if you're set on reading it. Otherwise I would just avoid it all together. There was really nothing redeeming about the read at all. Not one likeable character, and a serious lack of wit or humor."
3,They should make it into a movie...book can be improved on.,"A funny book, but a real downer at the end. Satirical and exaggerated, like a piece of comedy certainly has the right to be. Things don't seem to feel resolved at the end, however. Too many loose ends, as if Nanny was only interesting as a character while working for the Xes. And I was never satisfied with Nanny's reason for staying in her job. Grayer didn't seem all that adorable.This could really work well as a movie, with actors to flesh out the characters and some streamlining of the plot (such as it was) to keep it under two hours. Perhaps an ending where Nanny really does stand up to Mrs. X?"
4,Four stars for Nanny!,"A great read, interesting insight into the nanny world. Although I'd like to think all of the book is complete fiction, I am sure some of the events are based upon the authors' real experiences. Wow."
2,NOT funny,"I read this book after reading <u>The Nanny</u> by Melissa Nathan, and reviews in amazon that this is a funny book. Biting Satire maybe, but hardly funny. This book is more a sad commentary, and though I would recommend it to someone who wanted a glimpse of yuppie lifestyles, I wouldn't suggest it as a fun or funny read."
3,"Fun escape, easy to read","This isn't award-winning fiction, but as long as you going in expecting nothing more than a fun ride with some shocking moments, you'll be satisfied with the book.My main complaint with the novel was that it was too general, with characters having names like ""Nanny"" and ""Mrs. X."" The authors tried to conglomerate almost too many experiences into generic characters. This book was hyped well, and while it was fun to have my jaw drop at the exploits of the rich and famous, and their poor treatment of their children and nanny, this isn't a book to read for the quality of the writing or the character development. Nanny's boyfriend was entirely 1-dimensional. I also have no idea how the main character could have done well in school. Her schedule is completely unrealistic."
5,Wry Insider View of NYC Elite and Their Child Rearing,"Seeing the behind-the-scenes lives of New York's super-rich and their children is an eye-opener. Nanny, a savvy college student, can't help bonding with her charge, Grayer, and experiences with him the pain of having disfunctional parents.They are so wrapped up in their high-powered lives, that a child is merely a nuisance to be shown off on occasion and otherwise kept out of sight. Read Nanny's descriptions of the ups and downs and how she copes with Grayer's needs and keeps her own life somewhat on track.You'll laugh - You'll cry - You'll hope they are writing another book (I just checked and their 2nd book, Citizen Girl, comes out Nov. 16)."
4,"A humorous, yet somewhat sad read...","I've always been fascinated with books that deal w/how the other half (the wealthy//privileged) live, and this book was no exception. How Nanny stayed w/ the X family as long as she did is beyond me. Mr. & Mrs. X infuriated me, as a parent. There were plenty of humorous, laugh-out-loud moments in this book to keep it light. I gave it 4 stars because it was a quick, entertaining read."
4,"""Life"" in the rarified air of the upper social strata","The authors really had me believing that some people who hire nannies don't breathe oxygen -- helium, or laughing gas would be more like it.Since truth IS stranger than fiction, I'm inclined to believe that this book is definitely based on fact, regardless of its opening disclaimer.It's hard NOT to dislike the X's, and in my case, their bratty Grayson. What I found hard to believe was that Nan put up with it for so long.... but then, when you're young and idealistic, you tend more towards martyrdom than you would as an older and wiser individual. Or, perhaps Nan was a glutton for punishment.I did, however, admire Nan's sardonic, WICKED sense of humor and her ability to adapt and survive. This is ALOT more than I could say for the X's, who had everything ....but... really DIDN'T.I found the panty hunt hilarious, the food fight chilling, and the Halloween party hysterical.And, in the end, I was VERY glad that Grace prevailed."
5,Loved it! Great insight into their world!,"First of all the names weren't supposed to be ""original"". They were using those names ""to protect the innocent"".I thought this book was very wel written and ingenious! If you've never worked for an evil boss, whether it be in the nanny field or otherwise, you just wouldn't understand! This was a fantastic book with great characters. Definitely worth the read!"
4,"Funny, if you're not one.","This book was very funny,I thought. My daughter,howevwe, who has actuallty BEEN a nanny didn't think so. So maybe I just have enough Distance from the Experience of Young Children to find it humorous !I thought it was great. Also the author's reflections on life through the main character's eyes,, a young college student,also brought back memories."
2,huh?,"I honestly don't know what the big hype is. I thought this book was one of those can't-put-down, have-to-read-in-one sitting but it's far from it. I didn't find it funny."
2,frustrating,"This book is not badly written, but anyone pushing it as a comedy has got to be kidding themselves. There are funny parts, to be sure, but mostly the book is just full of frustration. As I read, I became more and more agitated, and though my job has nothing to do with children, by the end of the book I was even feeling irritated with my job. I would have felt better if we knew Nanny came out alright or at least got some sort of revenge. No one, and I mean no one would allow someone to walk all over them that badly. Even Mary Poppins would have blown."
1,Ick.,"There are too many well-written, interesting, wonderful books in existence to waste your time with this one. True, the uber rich, completely self-involved, Upper Manhattan parent exists and should be exposed, but it could/should have been done with more character development, humor and angst. I found little to enjoy here."
3,Good Middle Line.. Bad Support,"I liked the main plot of the book, and found that pretty much a quick page-turner. I enjoyed rooting for nanny, even though she sometimes found it difficult to stand up for herself.The main problem, however, that I had witht his book are the supporting characters (not Nanny or the Xes). We never really learn too much about them, so I find that there really is no point.Pretty quick and fun read though ( when you aren't twinging in pain over the lack of interest that either X parent has in their child)."
2,Not accurate at all...,"As a 15 year old who lives on the Upper East Side and has had a nanny all her life, I am very disappointed in this book. It is very sterotypical, and does not portray people from the upper class in NYC fairly. I have lived my life with a nanny and been sent away to boarding school, but that does not mean my mother was a mother like Mrs. X. I expected a book I could relate to, and instead ended up being insulted."
5,The Nanny Diaries,"As a collegestudent/nanny for a family I thought this book was completely accurate discribing the insanity ""mommies"" put their nannies through. Kudos to McLaughlin and Kraus who were able to put their experiences into words. The book was so well written I staid up until 3 am to finish it. I highly recommend the book."
5,I loved this book,"I found this book by first time writers extremely funny! I didn't want to put it down. Every chance I got, I was reading! At times the characters seem to go too far, but that is what makes it such a good read, the reader can't wait to see what they do next. Bravo to these two former nannys turned authors for giving us such a good read that is filled with lots of laughs at such a somber time for America."
4,Nanny Diaries Book,"This is a great book. Many times it was hard to put down. I like it much better than the movie because it was so different and I liked the characters in the book better. I would reccomend this book to anyone who liked the movie or just likes this kind of stuff. Just a Warning though, it uses a lot of curse words and most of the time the ""f"" word. So, this book might not be so much for younger ones. Good though."
4,Great Book!,"God, I hope none of this is based on real life, although I think it is. This is a book all about how a struggling NYU student takes a job as a nanny, and becomes one woman's slave. You will find yourself hating the spoiled, self-absorbed mother in this book. I know there has to be some truth to this story and it makes me sick that some mothers would basically just give the job of raising the child to someone else. And the father in this story, no better. In the end, the parents get what they deserve, I would of like to have seen the nanny be just a little bit more vindictive though."
4,A funny light read!,"The Nanny Diaries is a very funny novel about a woman's trials as a nanny to a very rich family in New York City. It is a wonderful light read to consider if you are looking for a good laugh. It is also very touching to see how Nanny bonds with Grover, and upseting to see how his family treats him. I would definately recommend this book to anyone!"
4,A top notch book...,"The Nanny Diaries: A Novel is one of the best reads I've found in a while. Thoroughly engrossing, funny, smart and sad. An all around excellent plot with engaging characters. Nan is a wonderful and very realistic heroine. Read this book!"
1,i understand how the nannie of a wealthy family would like it but i didn't!,"it was boring. characters, and relationships between characters, were poorly constructed and by the end i didn't care about any of them. no emotional involvement."
3,not really a funny book ...,"like the other reviews, i thought it was more sad and aggravating (the nanny puts up with WAY too much). what really bothered me, though, was the ending. nothing was really concluded at all. is she going to find a new apartment? does she have enough money to find a new place? does the tape left at Mr. and Mrs. X's apartment get viewed? this book ends much too abruptly. i guess they're going to write a sequel since this book was a bestseller, but each book should stand as a cohesive unit on its own and this one doesn't do that."
3,Airplane Reading...,"Prepare to be flung into the utterly depressing world of NYC snobs and thier indifference toward their children and the ""help"". This story of a college student hired to work for Mrs. ""X"" is not a comedy as advertised, but a sad look into a world where nannies play the part of parent while the real ones waste their time on shopping and treat their children like a disease. I give this book three stars not because it left a bad taste in my mouth, but because the writing was substandard and the characters flat. Still, a prospective reader should take it for what it's worth: a brainless but entertaining novel on a very intriguing subject that will help pass the time. (Admittidly, I read the whole thing today and couldn't put it down.)"
3,another nanny's opinion,The authors really exposed the wealthy's dirty laundry. An enlightning book for those who are not familiar with the lifestyle of these people. I work as a nanny in a very affluent area very close to Manhattan and a lot of employers around here are like Mr. and Mrs. X with children like Grayer.
3,Decent guilty pleasure book,"This was a quick read that I found pretty entertaining. I never laughed out loud or anything, but the ridiculous demands made by Nanny's employer fascinated me in a train wreck-like fashion. Out of ten, I'd say the writing quality was 7/10, but there wasn't much of a plot arc, and the main character was rather unbelievable. The narrator is almost certainly the author herself, and as a result, has no apparent flaws. Conversely, the author seems to despise her antagonist so much that she allows Mrs. X no redeeming qualities whatsoever. This very black and white conflict gives the book a kind of self-righteous, ""look how she treated poor me"" vibe. That being said, I did enjoy the book, though the ending was rather disappointing and anti-climactic. You could do much worse than kill time with this book."
3,Quick Read,"Definitely a quick read, but not as good as I would have expected from other reviewers. I liked it, but did not LOVE it."
3,Finally read it,"So I had heard this was such a funny, touching book and finally pick it up for a read. It started off a bit slow, but managed to be quite funny and touching. Working as a nanny for a family where the father works too much and sleeps around, and the mothers idea of work is getting her nails done and ignoring her child, while being boss about how exactly to the T things should be done... Nanny has to put up with a lot. Just when do things get to be too much? When does the evils of the mother outweigh the sweetness and innocence of little boy Grayer? Thats the interesting part. The comulsive bossyness of the the mother, Mrs. X, and the nanny who has to learn to deal..."
3,Laugh and weep at the same time.,"Oh, the foibles and weak minds of the idle rich. Those pathetic people who have children for all the wrong reasons: to dress them up, photograph them for their Christmas cards, and put them into the competitive, obscenely expensive, private school world so they can brag to their friends. Who could not love Grayer, the poor little rich kid, son of a bimbo and her philandering, shallow, materialistic husband? As for Nanny, she was the best thing that little Grayer ever had in his young life. A breezy, reader-friendly, tragi-comedy. You laugh but want to cry at the same time, especially if you know these ridiculously shallow people more than you care to admit--my daughter's NYC friends, the X's, every last one of them. Finally, you wish Nanny well and pray for Grayer, pray that the next Nanny will be as loving, because that's the only love young Grayer will ever know."
4,Funny,"This is a good, fun, easy read. Anytime you get a chance to take a look into a world you're unfamiliar with, you're bound to be shocked at what an 'expert' (someone in the trenches) has to say. Such is the case here. Obviously embellished, but we get the point.Other funny books from 'experts' in the trenches: ""No One's Even Bleeding"" and ""Delano""."
4,I used to be a nanny,"I loved it. I was a nanny, and none of the stuff that happened to these characters happened to me, but I still liked it. I can recommend it to anyone that asks me about it."
5,I want more!,"I loved this book! I wish it were longer, as I wanted to read more. I am a 29 year old mother of two children (a two year old and a four month old), and this book really puts things into perspective. My children are my life...it's really sad to read that to this family of upper class NYC society, a child is meerly a status symbol to dress in Ralph Lauren and to send to French lessons. I gave my children a big old hug after reading this story..."
5,A Wonderful Combination of Emotions,"I could not put this book down. I recommend it to everyone. It's funny, sad, upsetting... you name it it has it. I read this book about 5 months ago and I still catch myself thinking of the little boy in the story (little G as I like to call him). It is definitely a must read."
3,The Nanny Diaries,"When i first started, i could not put the book down- i was absorbed in the life of Nanny and the X's however toward thee end of the book it slowed down and I found I had a hard time finishing the book( i ended up skipping a few pages) the trip to Nantucket just moved to slow for me. Overall it was a pretty good book- the 2nd half could have been a lot better thought"
2,What's all the fuss?,I hearrd this was really good ala Bridget Jones. It's not even in the same catagory. Kind of depressing really.
2,Very disappointing!,"I heard all the hype about this book and decided to buy it. Unfortunately, I wasn't too impressed with what I read. You probably know by now what it's all about: a nanny taking care of a snobby NY family's 4-year-old, and all the (mis)adventures that happen along the way.All through the book, I kept thinking ""Why doesn't she get out of there???"" or at least ""Why doesn't she tell these people off???"" I didn't feel sorry for Nanny, nor did I think she was doing anything extraordinary. A college student should know well enough to get a better, well-paying, higher profile job than that. She never stands up for herself, and she ends up leaving in the wimpiest way possible.OK, it was funny at times, but it didn't really live up to all the hype that went along with it. Very disappointing!!!"
3,Guilty Pleasure,"Okay, so I didn't buy the book, I did what any underpaid nanny would do, I (finally) checked it out of the library. And no, I'm not a nanny.The writing could stand some work, but overall I enjoyed the book. Yes, it comes to some harsh conclusions about people with lots and lots o' money. But it's not mean if it's true. I have a sneaking suspicion this is true."
4,Worth your time.....especially if you are a parent.,"Compelling....I bought the book on tape and have already listened to it twice. It is compelling both in the story line and reading style. I feel like a better parent and person because I appreciate having raised good kids myself, and never asking someone else to do what I would not. For once, I am really glad that I am not rich, and do not feel the ""need"" to have things a specific way all of the time. Good kids come from good parenting, and nothing more.Kudos to the authors for telling their, and many others', story."
3,Little boy lost,"I agree with the reviewer who found this book utterly sad. The novel was funny at times but the ending left me completely heartbroken. Although his character wasn't fully developed, I really felt very sorry for Grayer, who was knocking himself out to get his parent's love and never seemed to succeed.If this is truly how the rich treat their children, then we are in a sad state of being in America..."
5,A Fun Summer Read!,"This book is such a kick! It's a hilarious look at the day to day life of a Nanny for a (fictitious?) wealthy family of New York City. It's written and inspired by the experiences and observations of two (former) Nannies which really makes this book work so well! You will laugh out loud and also be appalled at how the wealthy interact with their children. It's a quick read that is PERFECT for Summer! If you liked ""Bridget Jones Diary"" GET THIS, you'll like it!"
2,Not very talented but true,"Could just call the authors original or talanted, but... Being at one point in my life a nanny for rich cannot agree more.You grow to love their kids and as soon as you inconvenience them you are discarded. In overall engaging book but mostly for those of us who had been there, nothing new though."
4,At least the kid's funny,"So many funny observations, such a weak ending!These Diaries nail the way 4-year olds talk and the way imaginary rich people in books act, all to hilarious effect. Thus one hopes for a showdown at the end, where Nanny finally pushes back and stands up to persecution. Well...maybe in the movie version."
1,no tears from me!,"Reading this book made me feel like I should be feeling very sorry for poor ""Nan"" the nanny.... she has to work sooo hard, is unappreciated, and is asked to do things beyond the realm of pure child care (cook a dinner, run errands while Grayer is at his music lesson, etc.). And she only gets paid $12/hour, with no Christmas bonus!! And the employers have the nerve to question why she has not done anything beyond the ordinary in terms of child development (which is her major, after all).Sorry, this sob story didn't work with me. Nanny isn't working in a sweatshop, for crying out loud!Coupled with incomplete side story-lines (what's up with her dad and Collegiate?), one-dimensional characters (Harvard Hotty, the high school friend) - don't waste your time!"
2,Fun and breezy? No way,"Like many people, I bought this book expecting a comedy. But after reading the first chapter, I was deeply disturbed and wanted to return it. Now that I've finished it, I think I should have listened to my instincts.This book is almost unbearable to read for any mother who loves her child. Mrs. X is utterly without any redeeming qualities, which makes her unbelievable as a character. More like a monster. Are Park Avenue moms really like this? I'm sorry; I can't accept that. And the seething resentment Nanny has for her makes me not like Nanny much either. Must every character be so two-dimensional? Nanny good, Mommy bad.This book is marketed as a modern-day Mary Poppins. But in Mary Poppins, the neglectful parents eventually come around and learn to appreciate their children. If only the authors hadn't been so full of hate toward their former employers, they might have allowed the Xes a happy ending."
2,Better read Mary Poppins,"Of course this story could be real. But when you read it it doesn't say nothing. The way the nanny is treated by the kid and by her boss is pathetic. If you want to learn how to be a nanny, better read Mary Poppins than this one. It's much better."
3,More sad than funny for me. . .,"I found much of the book funny but found myself overwhelmingly sad at the life this poor child led. All he had for stability were his ""nannies"" and when Mrs. X decides they have to leave for one transgression or another, he is the one who truly suffers. The last few pages where heartbreaking. . .I find the reviews that call the book hilarious very disturbing."
2,"Save the money and the time for the movie, if you must","I can see why this book has been made into a movie, the NYC setting, the glamorous scenes and possibly quite a few sweet little interactions between the nanny and the child. It can easily be the squeal of The Devil Wears Prada with a stroller, a screaming kid and far less likable adults.Sure, the book does keep you going, and the sentence ""Impossible to put down"" isn't untrue. But what's the point of this book when it wasn't even exactly a fun read?I honestly didn't expect much from this book but I also didn't expect that many pages filled with shallow descriptions, typical name-dropping and nearly everyone in the book sharing the same sarcasm.Please, save the few bucks on the movie if you must, at least the movie should be fewer than two hours!"
4,Satirical. A good first novel.,"This was a breezy, fun book. It's not Shakespeare, but, it was well worth the time it took to read it. It had some passages in it that made me start giggling as I was reading. I think that the reviewers that said the authors didn't fill out characters very well miss the point of the book. It is satire, plain and simple, not a character analysis. After all, how much can you say about these folks? It was more a collection of mostly amusing and sometimes sad observations. The writing reminded me a little of David Sedaris's work: a little fun, a little emotion and some dead on observations about a certain segment of life thrown in for good measure."
1,A juvenile book about nothing.,"First of all, I admit I had moderate expectations for the book, thinking that the topic of being a nanny to the high and mighty might be pretty funny, or at least ""so true."" But this book was a BIG disappointment - it was neither funny nor true. It tries so hard to be cute and smug, but the protagonist comes off as a giddy, witless college student, who wonders, just before a ""big date,"" if she's shaved that morning! Then, of course, there is the ""intrigue"" of the extramarital affair Mr X is having, but you sympathize so little for anyone in the book that you just don't care. The story here is so hackneyed and contrived, I can't believe the book made the best seller list. Don't waste your time. Keep your money."
2,"Eh, not that great","This is one of the books that my mom got for me for my birthday, and it was the first I read, but I kept putting it down. It wasn't that the characters weren't interesting (they were, in a surface-level way) or the plot wasn't engaging (it was, in a, well, surface-level way), but I just kept thinking ""why?"" Why bother writing it at all? Except it's obviously made a lot of money, so that's a reason, too. Anyway, perhaps a good beach read, not much more."
2,Not quite there,"I was never able to fully get into this book. I kept waiting for something to happen it seems like, and then nothing ever did. I hate how Nanny didn't have the balls to stand up for herself. Even after leaving the X's, she still didn't at least give the readers the satisfaction of revenge. The best part of the story was Harvard Hottie, and even that was underdeveloped. I was left very unsatisfied after reading this."
2,Such a sad book...,"I am not sure how anyone could think of this tale as either funny or a light read. Sure, there are some scenarios that are so outrageous you cannot help but chuckle, especially in the beginning of the book, but honestly the last 1/3 of the book left me wanting to cry for that poor little boy. The scene where Nan leaves the beach house, with G wailing in the background wondering where she has gone, has haunted me. As a parent of small children, I can't bring myself to imagine how that poor child could recover from the systematic emotional abuse he suffers from his ""parents."" It is obvious he loves N so much that to have her ""abandon"" him, as I'm sure this is how his parents would explain it, would be beyond cruel and heartless.I think the reviewers who portray this as a funny, light read are reading the surface of the book only, and must be disconnected from the heartbreaking life of that little boy."
1,Funny...for 30 pages,"This book was funny...for about 30 pages. But after that, the story of these self-centered, materialistic, and shallow people just became repetitive and sad."
2,A Lousy Ending,"I actually enjoyed this book up until about the last third. I really really disliked the ending, I felt I had spent all this time getting into the story, getting to know the characters and the ending was such a letdown. I just ended up feeling really sad for everyone involved in this story. I guess I would have really liked to see some kind of resolution, or at the very least some characters get what they had coming to them.DON'T READ FURTHER IF DON'T WANT TO KNOW SOME DETAILSI just didn't like how nanny said she knew she would never see Grayer again, but I mean come on, she is currently dating a guy who lives in the same building as the family, your telling me that she might never bump into them.Just a very weak ending that spoiled the whole book."
2,Disappointing,"I think the premise of this novel lends itself to a much smarter and funnier book than this turned out to be. I found it to be depressing and frustrating when I was expecting a light and funny read. While I don't doubt the depictions of the neglectful parents and their hollow lives, it got tiresome to read about the family piling more and more abuse on the nanny who continued to take it. The ending, although not surprising, was a let down and could have been much more satisfying.This book wasn't written particularly well. The characterizations were inconsistent and didn't ring true. I was pretty disappointed."
2,The Nanny Diaries,"The first chapter was brilliantly written, but then it took a giant nose dive. The story became redundant and the lack of descriptives did not help it, i had difficulty really imagining the characters and story's backdrop. The endless use of Mr.& Mrs X, Ms.Chicago and Nanny was just plain annoying. After awhile you just want this book to end. ( However,i did get tearful when Nanny was spending her last moments with Grayer)."
2,Not So Funny,"As with many other reviewiers, I found this book much more sad than funny. I didn't enjoy watching the emotional torture of this young girl and little boy unfold. It was a quick read, but not particularly entertaining."
2,disappointing,"Although I found this book somewhat entertaining, it was not at all what I expected. Frankly I wanted to scream QUIT already. Nanny had absolutely no backbone. I was hoping she actually found the nerve to record the message at the end of the book, but again, that was only wishful thinking. Light easy summer read, but way too much hype."
2,Bogged down by its writing style..,"The Nanny Diaries in theory was a really good idea--exposing the lives of insanely rich Manhattan socialites and their lack of care for their children, etc, and what they put their nannies through. The intro (about the first 5 pages) was perhaps the best part of the book, excellently executed with a style and grace lacking in the rest of the book. The rest of the book really isn't that bad, but the writing style drags it down. It is written almost like a teenage-girl would talk, and it gets incredibly annoying. You find the authors saying things like "" OH my ..., there goes my Harvard HOTTIE! OMG he is so cute!"" etc, and it just takes away from the story. This book could have really said something about this secret subculture of ignorant rich parents, but instead is ruined by its show of idiotic language."
2,A study in masochism but a good read nonetheless,"Although I enjoyed the writing style used by the authors of ""The Nanny Diaries,"" I was appalled by the plot. The book seemed to be a study in financial and emotional blackmail. I found Nanny (the main character)'s refusal to stand up for herself disappointing at best and saw her plight wholly of her own making. It was next to impossible for me to respect her, and that made it difficult to enjoy the book. I kept waiting for the book to get interesting, maybe take an unexpected turn, but it never did, the outcome was spelled out at the start. Bummer. Such potential for an interesting story that never got off the ground."
4,Children Stuck in the Middle (as always!),"This book is a classic view of how children in high-income homes get stuck in the middle.Nanny has to live around stupid, minute, ridiculous rules with a high-maintenance wife who hired her out of the blue, a husband (""Mr. X"") who probably does not even love the child or the wife and give this poor child (Grayer) some sense of stability and love before they fire her out of the blue and pass the child onto another nanny who is going to have to fill the gap and try to give this child some love again!This is a classic insiders view of the NY Nanny-Ghetto of underpaid women who try and give these children some stability from their f-ed-up parents --- total beach book but a great read!"
1,Single-dimensional characters + lousy dialogue= 1 star,"I'm surprised that so many people love this book. Had the characters been multi-dimensional, I might have enjoyed it more. I quickly grew tired of reading about how completely evil Mr and Mrs X were and how perfect Nanny was. Every move the mother made was harsh and cruel, whereas Nanny's every touch was ""gentle."" Puh-leeze."
1,This was a big let down,"I was so looking forward to this book. I love satire. I only laughed maybe one time. The rest of the time I was shocked by the poor writing, structure and character development. It was also just depressing. I think the authors have a motive of trying to get parents (wealthy or not, it isn't just the rich who supposedly ignore their kids) to love and spend more time with their children. While I wholeheartedly agree with them, 300 pages of bad writing and one dimensional characters is too tedious. The ending is terrible. The ""Nanny"" is so spineless, there is no one to root for here except maybe little Grayor. It's just totally depressing. (didn't I say that already?) Don't waste your time or money, instead, go spend some significant, quality time with a child."
3,An Okay Read,"In my opinion, this book was okay - just okay. You have a hard time liking the main character because there isn't much character development. And, she has no backbone. You get to the point of wanting to scream 'oh, grow up already!' The book was fine, I wasn't bored, I just wasn't very captivated."
2,not sure what the fuss is about,"I'm not sure why this book is so popular. The characters are all completely one dimensional--the narrator is perfect in her caretaking, has a perfect loving, appropriately quirky family, and a perfect, terrific boyfriend, while the family she works for has not a single redeaming quality. The neglect the child experiences at the hands of his family is sad, not funny, and the narrators ""doormat"" reaction to the abuses of her employer are infuriating and not funny. At the end, of course, she gets to sermonize about the importance of loving a child. Its a bit yucky."
3,The Nanny Diaries:A Novel,"It is a very light frothy book. I found it excellent ""bubblegum"" for the mind.This is a ""chick"" book and it will find its greatest appeal to the reader that never employs a sitter and who has never lived in a city."
4,A must-read for all college students babysitters!,"An engaging tale of an NYU senior's perils childminding the child of a rich and distracted Upper East side couple. I kept wishing Nanny would listen to her mother and leave the X's and find a better situation. I could empathize with her devotion to Grayer. Sorry to say, but Nanny's plight is similar to that of many college students who need to make some cash. Kudos for keeping their portrayal of Mr. and Mrs. X superficial throughout the story!"
4,"Great, fun novel","I would have given this 5 stars, but there were parts that drug along. Overall, it was an interesting and fun read, giving great insight into the world of the rich and famous who choose to ignore their children."
3,Vacationing Soon?,"A quick way to sum up this novel? Fun. This book has it all: juggling college kid, annoying roommate, love interest, childhood fun, unfaithful husband, callous wife, eccentric grandma - the list goes on and on. The story gives a great look at the stereotypical New York elite (fiction or not, you all know these people exist) and the people who serve them. The dialogue is at times very unconvincing, but the story plays itself out regardless. A lot of loose ends are left at the end, leaving you to imagine the next stages of Nanny's life. Or if you're like me, it will drive you crazy wanting to know what happened with this, that, and the other thing. This is definitely a beach novel - fun, fast, and always entertaining."
4,Fun and Easy Read,This was a fast read and fun. I liked reading about the upper crust in New YOrk and because the authors had been nannies before it made it extremely believable.
3,A Good Quickie Beach Read,"This book goes fast as the reader peers thru a keyhole to see how the ""other half"" lives.It's not very flattering as Mrs. X runs around in her self-absorbed world neglecting her son,4 year old Grayer. She leaves him in the care of Nan,an NYU grad student.With this power couple's mega-millions,why do they hire a grad student & not a professional nanny???Just another nail in the coffin of Mrs. X's mothering abilities & judgement.The reader acquires a profound sympathy for poor Grayer as he is taxied around to nonsensical lessons & playdates -- anything to keep out of his mother's way.The funniest character is Nan's granny.She is a hoot as Nan portrays her as a dowager who has her act together & really knows herself.A few storylines go unfinished,but this is quite good for a first book.Don't expect to finish the book with any new revelations.Like I said,it's just an enjoying beach read and a peek into the lives of NY's rich and shameless."
4,Utterly weird but believable,"This is not the usual type of book I read but I couldn't put it down. It's a look into how parents may not be the best judge of what happens to their kids, and would love to see a sequel on what happened to Grayer."
3,A sad story,"I had heard a lot about this book and checked it out from my library expecting to have a few laughs.I found it very sad. These strange people who live in Manhattan and have children only for show apparently are sick. What a bunch of phoneys! I thought it was dreadful the way these supposedly upper class families treat their employees. What is worse is how the nannies and others put up with it.I believe this book was made up from several experiences with different families. However, if I had worked for the ""X's"" I would not have lasted a week. What a tacky pair!"
4,More Than Just Trashy Fun (But Not Much More),"Knowing that much of the action is this book is based on the authors' real life experiences as nannies in New York made me cringe and worry for these people's children. Are rich New Yorkers really that horrible? I wasn't expecting such crisp and (pretty) deep characterization. The young charge truly tugs at your heartstrings. Maybe it was because I stayed up entirely too late so I could finish it, but tears flowed reading the emotionally climatic ending. But in between is some really trashy, bitchy fun."
4,Child abuse!,"Though I despised the ""Xs""in this book, due to sorrow for ""Grayer"" and a facsination with what monstrous act the ""Xs"" would commit next, I could not get this book out of my hands - I read it straight through in an afternoon. What these mothers and fathers do to their childrent is child abuse. There are no other words for it. It was sickening the way the ""Xs"" treated people and animals in this book. The parents should not be allowed to procreate."
3,A guilty pleasure...,"When you drive by an accident on the freeway, can you help turning your head to look for bodies? Reading this book gave me the same sort of queasy, guilty pleasure. It's not a piece of great literature, but somehow you just can't turn your head away. I read this book on a rainy afternoon, reclining on the couch and munching cookies and drinking tea. Fun, fun, fun, like a good gossip with a girlfriend, but by no means uplifting or spiritually illuminating. But, hey, sometimes girls just want to have fun! I can't judge if this is an accurate look at the New York rich scene, but it FELT real, and it was a fun read."
4,Fizzled,"I thought the characters were good and the story line was awesome. But I found myself profoundly disappointed with the ending. I was hoping for Shawshank Redemption when he escapes or Al Pacino's final speech in Scent of a Woman. It was apparant that this kind of memorable ending was their goal but they could not quite achieve it.That said, I would recommend this book because you will not have the high expectiations that I did."
3,not what it's cracked up to be,"I chose this book thinking it would be a funny, satirical look at the ultra wealthy, and in many ways it is, however, to me it was mostly depressing. I didn't come away from the book feeling ""yeah, they nailed them!"" I came away feeling sad and disappointed. This is not the book to pick up if you want a good laugh, if you want a real downer--go for it."
2,Disappointing book!,"I couldn't get beyond Mrs. X contining to take advantage of Nanny and Mrs. X's outrageous demands on Nanny to even care about Nanny or Grayer (child supposed to be cared for). Most of the book is Nanny complaining about Mrs X's demands then making up excuses about why she should accomodate them for Grayer's sake. By the end, I felt like Nanny deserved all the rotten treatment because she took it. Overall, I'm frustrated the book never got better & I wasted time reading it. I'll never waste my time reading another book by these authors."
4,"Great, especially if you're a New Yorker","If you've ever walked through the Upper East Side and spotted a five year old dressed in his private school uniform carrying a lacrosse stick, you'll understand that people like the X'es really do exist. The people decked out in designer bests at Tiffany's and Bergdorf's and Barney's with their minority caretakers in tow walk the streets of Manhattan every day.This book was very funny. I started reading it last night and finished it tonight."
2,only mildly entertaining,"I found this book to be mildly entertaining at best. It was not well written, had an extremely weak plot, but did make me smile more than a few times, which made it worth a quick read. It was so fluffy, however, that after the first few chapters I was embarrassed to be seen reading it on the train. It amazes me the type of life experiences that people try to ""cash-in"" on."
1,not a novel,"The is one long rant. It seems to be based on a Dickension format of an angelic protagonist finally overcoming the mistreatments of others--yet there is no meaningful resolution at the end.The problem is that while the book depends on the outrageousness of the Xs' behavior for its interest, the characters have no credibility. The characters are cartoons, not human. I felt like I was reading a TV show.Poor writing!"
3,Amusing,"This novel is light, breezy and incredibly unbelievable. Read it when you are in the mood for chicklit-lite."
2,the nanny in this book is a big loser with no self esteem,I was apalled at what the nanny would put up with more than what the actual parents deigned to do or not do (as the case may be). She needed to get some balls and assert herself.
2,If your 21 years old and hopelessly self-centered...,"Wow, how is it that this book made the best seller list? I'm glad I got a discount on the purchase, otherwise I would be mad that I paid full price. If the person reading is 21 and still in a sorority, she might enjoy this snotty book. But if you are like me, educated, intelligent and hard working, your going to have a tough time relating to the book. It is full of lines like ""wow, those are Prada shoes"" and ""oh my god, that guy is so hot."" Wow, baseless and superficial. I don't feel for the characters, nor do I identify with them. I suppose others do, since it is on the best seller list."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"Mediocre book. If the characters are going to be 2-dimensional, then the book should have some other redeeming quality but instead it is cliche-ridden and about as well written as a grocery list."
3,Disturbing view of wealthy Manhattanites,"I purchased this book because it is on the New York Times bestseller list. To be honest I was expecting a light-hearted fun read. However, this is actually a chilling account of child abuse and neglect at the hands of two self-obsessed and cold hearted parents. I would hope and pray this is not an accurate account of people who hire nannies in NYC. But if it is, I am deeply saddened. Is it so competitive and shallow now in Manhattan, that parents would be so abusive to their child? Especially one so young? These are questions, I hope are addressed by people so that perhaps this kind of socially accepted abuse will cease."
2,"Interesting insights, but not smoothly written","Although Nan and Grayer's plights rang true, I was not drawn into the story at all. I could not follow all brand names of foreign and domestic foods dropped, and found the prose and storyline rather 'clunky.' The book is not 'hilarious.'Perhaps I had expected more from all the hype in the reviews I found here."
3,Somewhat Funny,"Wanted more of Mr. and Mrs. X and less of Nanny. Not well-written but amusing none-the-less. Good summer read. Not as funny as NYTimes quote but if you are from NYC or familiar with the scene on the Upper East Side, then the book will have deeper meaning and charm; and if you are looking for a slice-of-life, a very narrow slice of life read then it's worth the price."
3,Wasn't quite up to the hype it was given,"I couldn't wait to read this book because of all the reviews and hype it got. I read the book and don't get me wrong, it is a good book. But after everything I had heard, I expected more. I am sure that anyone that has been a nanny (especially in Manhattan) probably loved the book. But those of us that have never worked in this profession may find the stories a little far fetched. Maybe there really are families like the X family, but I couldn't quite relate."
3,"Good book, but the language was unnecessary","As a mother of a toddler, this book gave me some insight of how the childcare industry is treated. It also gave me some tips on how to cope with my toddler's tantrums.I couldn't put the book down, I just had to see what was happening. But I was very disappointed by the excessive foul language, especially the F word. There is absolutely no need to put that kind of language in a book; and it certainly should not be used in front of children the way it was in the story.I was also left hanging in the end because the romance part of the story wasn't played out; but that's just me."
3,Too many expletives,"This was an interesting book -- an eye opener for those of us who can't afford, nor want to, a nanny. I wish the authors would have used fewer expletives -- particularly the ""f"" word. That's the biggest downfall of this book.My sympathies to those raised in this high stress, affluent lifestyle. I'm glad there are caring nannies to make up for the absence of the important mother figure."
4,An engaging read,"Almost a five only because I couldn't understand why Nanny stuck around for Mrs.X's abuse. That aspect of the novel could have used some development, I thought, because Grayer's ""cute"" side rarely showed through.Although this is a work of fiction, it raises some interesting questions about childcare, mothering, and the social expectations of nurturing. Nanny says something to the effect that no one ever acknowledges raising children is HARD WORK. The assumption is that child care is a pleasure (with low wages).That said, though, I finished the book in less than 48 hours myself, because I truly felt for Nanny. She is someone I would like to have lunch with. And, the story was entertaining. I laughed out loud during the Halloween party scene. Hilarious!"
5,Read this book!!!,"""The Nanny Diaries"" is a easy to read, easy to get into, and easy to love book. It was also hard to put down, my son literally ripped it out of my hand!I laughed, I cried, I overall had an awesome time reading it. It was a perfect summer read.Thank you and kudos to the authors for such an outstanding job on their first novel!!"
5,FABULOUS,"I hate to sound so cliche, but this is a must read! You won't believe your eyes while you get a vicariuos thrill looking into the rich world of the upper east side. You'll come away thankful you didn't grow up in such ""priviledge"""
1,"If I could, I'd give it a zero","Wow. What a dissapointment. There's no real character development, shoddy writing and the main characters are hard to relate to.I've been in Nanny's shoes and it amazes me that she'd be so spineless. Why is she even getting a degree at all? It will serve her no good, for she hasn't the sense to even begin to know how to use it or interact with others in a meaningful way.Terribly sad, because I wanted to enjoy this read. Wish I had gotten it from the library instead of buying it."
4,I know the X's!,"I lived in NYC and this book is so sadly believable! I know a woman just like Mrs. X (my ex.'s sister). She lives in a penthouse over looking central park - the house is constantly filled with staff one to do the laundry and cook, another to keep the kids out of their parents way, a male personal assistant to keep her company, [kiss up to her], and to have an affair with, a husband completely involved with work and very absent from the family, and 2 children starved for their parents attention and affection. I cringed when Mrs. X states that she is pregnant again. People like this should not have children! The X's certainly didn't respect their Nanny's so why should the Nanny's respect the X's privacy. This is a story that needed telling! I think I will mail this book to the X's I know - but they probably won't get it."
2,Disappointing,"Wimpy, wimpy, wimpy are the only words to describe the main character Nanny in this book. She's the pawn of a narcissistic Park Avenue mother from the beginning to the end. I thought for sure that at the end of the book she would stand up for herself, grow as a character, and we the readers would feel a sense of completion. But right to the very end, this nanny let the mother use and abuse her. After awhile it's not funny and it's hard to sympathize with a doormat who never seems to learn. The book ends with Nanny making a videotape pleading for the parents to love their son before it's too late. That's it. Sure there were some funny parts, but overall, not worth it. Also, the writing is poor. You have to reread paragraphs again and again to figure out what in the world the authors are talking about."
2,Try Waitressing Nanny-o,"The first 100 pages kept me mildly amused and admittedly, it was a page turner for those. And then, it just seemed incredibly trite and devoid of any real character development. I think that if a person *really* likes this book he/she is not terribly bright. I know, ouch."
3,Fashionable but disappointing,"After hearing good things about this book, I expected better. The authors deal with a real issue (the shallow soullessness of some neglectful parents), but the prose is mediocre. They know two ways to express emotion: drawn-out spelling and sentence fragments. ""NoooOOOooo."" ""I waaaant it!!"" AAAAAAHHH!!!! HE'S KISSING ME!!!!!"" ""You have. No idea. What I do. For you."" These are used enthusiastically throughout the book.Nanny herself certainly has better parenting skills than the family she works for, but I kept waiting for her to show a greater depth of character as well. She never does. Nanny loves the boy she cares for, she has a loving family and she worries about money. But she falls in love for shallow reasons like Mrs. X, she values all the expensive trinkets her boss does (she just can't afford them), and she shows Mrs. X's same inability to be direct and stand up for herself. I kept waiting for a resolution or some wisdom gained that just never came."
1,"Very, very sad...","This book was purported to be very funny and light-heartedly entertaining. It wasn't.It was a sad commentary on those people who birth children and then proceed to neglect them for the next 16 or 17 years. This is all about a nanny and how she interacts with the family she works for. The little boy is very adequately drawn, with his sadness palpable. The nanny and her interactions with him seem to only illustrate his parents lack of interest and affection for their son. (He eats in the bathroom, so he won't mess up the rug... Good parenting skills...)There were very few scenes in this book that were funny or even mildly entertaining. There is, of course, a romantic interest for ""Nanny"". This is only vaguely touched on and never fully explored. For a comedy, this book is a real downer."
1,"NEVER received this book. I was charged for it, but it did not arrive.","NEVER received this book. I was charged for it, but it did not arrive."
1,nanny diaries; incident of the dog.,Both of these items were shipped to the wtrong address. I called and received no support. Dissapointed with Amazon. ( they went to my son in Iraq who as a Navy pilot does not have any interest in the Nanny Diaries!)
1,"Disappointing, inadvertent chariciture of itself","I am surprised this book is so popular when the plot is non-existent and the characters are soooo uni-dimensional. The writing, like it's characters, has NO depth. The main character is the only one with a personality, but they forgot to give her a backbone. I recognize she was struggling with her role as a nanny, but her passivity was a turn-off --not an example of her dedication to her job. The ending is beyond bad. I can't believe that was ok'ed by an editor!!! It's as if the authors got tired of their own story--so did I. I kept reading hoping it would improve, but no luck. don't bother."
2,Fast food for the urban brain,"I find it hard to resist books set in New York City, let alone books set in my own neighborhood. This one started well, but by the end, the authors' ability to trigger vicarious glee and ""shock"" at the antics of insensitive rich people and the too-good-for-her-own-good heroine wore off. After 50 or so funny pages, the book becomes boring and predictable. This is exactly the right book to read while doing something else--getting a pedicure, on the treadmill, at the beach. If it gets left behind before you finish, you won't care."
2,Never Lived Up to the Hype,"This book has rave reviews and I wonder did those reviewers actually read the book? It's a disjointed and wandering narrative that is not that good. It is sort of funny, but not really. The familt situation and the plight of that poor kid are the only emotionally resonant aspects of this book. The main character is weak and so is this literary attempt."
3,very sad story,"How anyone can describe this as funny is beyond me. It is a sad story of a small child that is totally ignored by his parents. The only people in his life who ever show him any love are his succession of nannies. And his parents seem to take the nannies away as soon as they question the parents. Very, very sad."
3,"Funny, but kinda sad too","I was pleasantly surprised when I first started reading this book. I didn't expect a whole lot in the way of good writing, especially considering all of the mass attention it received. Actually, I think the writers made a great first effort, and I look forward to seeing more from them.However, I was in no way expecting to feel slightly depressed from the book. But ultimately that's how it left me. Although you can laugh at the ridiculous female characters, the poor little rich kid just breaks your heart."
1,Poorly written,"The authors definitely hit a nerve with the timing of this book. We're always looking for new and different ways to expose the foibles and shortcomings of the super-rich. The book offers a unique look into this world, but I mostly found it to be poorly written. It's no better than the type of prose one might read in the typical creative writing class. Save yourself the money and borrow this one from a friend or the library."
4,An Un-put-downable sad story!,"The Nanny Diaries will make you rethink your dream to become one of Manhattan's elite. In this story, Nanny (appropriately named) agrees to work for the X's. She becomes little Grayer X's lifeline. In a world where outside appearances are everything, Nanny must pick up the slack for Mrs. X. In the process, Nanny almost becomes his ""mother""; It is the ending, however, that will leave you with tears in your eyes.This book does an excellent job of tugging at your heartstrings. I really began to feel for the children of competitive preparatory preschools, play groups and Park Avenue Apartments. A must read for any mother who questions her parenting skills!"
1,if you like doormats....,"Just like the shopaholic series, another predictable book about a woman who has no spine. What is with these books, and why are they so popular? On the upside, mildly interesting and engaging, but ""Devil Wears Prada"" is a much better pick. Female authors: how about some strong female characters who know how to stand up for themselves? No woman in her right mind -- fictional or real-- would put up with the BS in this novel.I had the audio CD, which has arguably the worst reading ever by Julia Roberts, who can't read her way out of a paper bag. The Salvadoran Nanny is read with a Japanese accent, the Maid's voice seems to vacilate between Spanish Harlem Chica and South Side Chicago Soul Sister. Laughable and entertaining."
3,An emotional roller coaster,I actually give this 3.5 stars.I enjoyed this book although you cannot help but wonder why does Nan put herself through the torture of working for the X's. It just seemed so masochistic and yet as we slowly saw how she bonded with Grayer I realized how tough a position she was in. Do you suck it up in order to stay and provide the love that your charge is seriously missing in their life? It made me want to cry to see how Grayer would reach out for affection towards both his mom and dad just to have them brush him aside to rush to a business meeting or a pedicure. I had initially thought this book was going to be mostly fluff but I was so wrong. It totally left my heart wringing in sadness for Grayer and all those children who probably do have lives similar to this. A wonderful read and the sequel is due out in December 2009.
2,Fluffy,"If you're in the mood for a breezy, fluffy book that mentions Prada and Hermes and Tiffany's every other page, this is for you. The authors aren't stupid; it's not poorly written, nor boring. Well, okay, it does get boring after 100 pages or so of the same thing. 300 pages = too much.I'm a New Yorker and the references are familiar and were fun at the start. The revenge factor was, in its evil way, fun too. Then I started to feel sorry for the real children whose nannies these were, who will one day read this. Also, just me - I like a book at least to say something about something, even if it is breezy reading.Take this one to the beach, or wherever, and space out - you'll finish in a couple of days and be no different for the experience... just perhaps able to recognize a greater amount of expensive brand names."
2,Not Diabolically funny at all,"I enjoyed reading this, but found it to be a remarkably sad commentary on disfunctional families, more than a satirical pastiche of nanny life. I'm not sure I would read it again, and I'm not sure that I would recommend others read it if you're looking for some dark comedy."
3,Nanny Diaries,"There's no doubt about it, this book has a great sense of humor, but after so much abuse, why does the nanny stay? Yes, the rich are awful. Anybody who has ever served them knows this. But at a certain point, you walk away.If it were not for the humor, this would have been a painful bore."
2,Too whiny,"I started out enjoying the book, but Nan was too whiny for me and had NO BACKBONE. It shows that some people can treat others as slaves and they do nothing about it.In the long run the child lost.I wonder how'll he'll function as an adult."
2,The families are believable; the nanny isn't,"It is easy to believe that there really are families and individuals who are as abusive as these people are. But that someone with the narrator/heroine's background and skills would accept the abuse for 9 months, and never speak up, is beyond any credibility."
4,Heartbreaking and haunting,"I was expecting a comedy, but this book touched my heart. I was near tears many times throughout this absolute page-turner. There are many kinds of child abuse and this book illustrates a cold selfish mother who cannot give love to her 4-year-old boy who needs it so desperately. At the end of the book all I wanted to do was find this little Grayer (the child in the book) and wrap my arms around him and take him home. This is a fascinating, heartbreaking, eye-opening book and it will stick with me for a long time. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it broke my heart too much."
4,Money can buy unhappiness,"I know this story is really just a parody about rich society families and how they too can be just as dysfunctional as the rest of us, but for some reason this novel really bothered me. It's not that I didn't enjoy it, the writing is witty and I had a few good laughs while reading. I can also state that the Mrs X's of the world don't just live in Manhattan, they are everywhere. Perhaps it's that as a Mom I felt such disgust over the treatment of Grayer by his uber rich parents that I could hardly keep reading at times. The Nanny Diaries is a quick and easy read, that while perhaps being a guilty pleasure read for some, made me want to go and give my son a big hug."
2,"Unsympathetic Character, Uncreative Writing","A beautiful upper middle-class NYU senior who will undoubtedly marry wealth and power and who will have a glamorous successful life decides to work part-time as a nanny for a family who probably lives two blocks north on the Upper East Side from where she grew up. First, this protagonist, with the decidedly banal name of ""Nan"" as in ""Nanny,"" happens to be neither sympathetic nor interesting, and I could care less if she nails her Harvard Hottie or if she can have a good morning's beauty sleep without being summoned by Mrs. X, the decidedly banal name of her employer. Written by two young beautiful supremely confident women, the protagonist is so completely self-obsessed, incapable of either doubt or reflection. The most annoying thing about the book is that it's supposed to be black satire but has been inundated with so much American saccharine feel-good wholesomeness that it tastes so sweet as to be bitter."
2,"Okay, but there are better.","I would have given this book two and a half stars, because that's what this book is -- average. The Nanny Diaries is readable and hard to put down, but it isn't particularly well-written or funny. It's okay, but there are better Chick Lit books out there. Pick up the Bridget Jones books, if you haven't already. Those are funny and they're not the least bit pretentious."
1,I Gave Up,"Halfway through the book, I gave up. There was nothing in it for me. I'd already been exposed to the rich-people-in-the-city stereotype so there was nothing new or humorous about this book.I don't understand the hype at all. But then, I couldn't understand the hype over Bridget Jones' Diary, either."
4,GREAT READ!,"I flipped through this book quickly! It has it funny moments it sad moments but most of all it's TRUE moments...I myself have been a nanny, and I saw eye to eye with a lot of the story. I think if your around kids You'll enjoy this book!"
3,Fun reading for the beach at the most...,"This book can be quite funny, but be warned that it is downright sad at points, especially when the authors highlight the way in which Nanny's young charge is neglected by his parents. I enjoyed this book on the level that it is a scathing examination of the private worlds of the ultra-rich, from how they decorate their million-dollar New York apartments; to what they wear; to how they party or treat the 'help.' But occasionally, the main character of this book is downright annoying. How am I supposed to sympathize with a protagonist who allows her employer to do things to her that would have any normal person running to the Labor Department to file suit? Take this one to the beach and use it as a light, fun read - don't expect tons of character development or any explanation of why Nanny is such a doormat."
4,So realistic!!!,I really liked this book because it is just the truth!! I am an expert babysitter and i can relate!! I have been babysitting for many different families full time and i found myself laughing when i realised how close to the reality what the author was describing was!!It is a fun book to read and i recommend it especially to people who like me suffered from babysitting for some CRAAZY people!!
4,Misleading,"Yes, its a very good book. However, I am furious about the billing it received as being ""funny"". Sure, there are funny situations Nanny finds herself in, but the book is about a four year old boy whose parents won't even hug or acknowledge. And just as he gets really close to his Nanny-of-the-year, she is let go and replaced. Yes, its a book many people should read, but not if they are expecting it to be funny or to have a happy ending."
3,Don't look for laughs,"I expected a rather hilarious take-off on the odd and perhaps wicked ways of the super-rich. Instead, even though this is a ""novel,"" I am heartsick at the neglect of the innocent children. It is particularly distressing to see the nanny, the only stable and caring person in the child's life, snatched away on a whim."
2,"Or, ""How to Torture Your Husband""",What better way to inflict pain (in classic Woodstock generation passive-aggressive style) than by withholding care and affection and substituting a disinterested third party into the relationship? There is absolutely no question as to the real villain of this piece. The central character spends most of her time trying not to be the screen on which the displaced desires of this sick family are projected.
4,These people do exist!,"This book realistically captures the ""High Rent"" lifestyle of the New York rich-or for that matter the upper crust across the country. I will qualify this by saying that all the rich are not like the characters depicted in the book, but there are some underlying similarities. The young women in this book tries desparately to give some semblence of normalicy to the young boy in the book. His parents are too busy or uninterested to take any special notice of him-except what he will be wearing when he plays with other children. She basically ends up being an indentured servant dealing with unrealistic requests from the spoiled parents. I know some people like Mrs. X in the book who go from massage appointments, to nail appointments to luncheons, but they treat their children much better. I am glad that the book was not too life-like.I loved this book. You can tell by the authors' refrences that hey are very familiar with their subjects."
3,Not outstanding,"While the book was funny at times and somewhat culturally pointed, it did not live up to the hype that preceded its release. Just an average book. Ok book, but wait to read a used copy and don't spring for your own copy."
3,Deeply Disturbing,"Don't believe the reviewers who call The Nanny Diaries ""hilarious"" or ""fun."" With a subject like this, one naturally expects satire, and that there is--but eventually the plight of the children being cared for by nannies in New York gets under your skin. Though the plot makes for page-turning suspense, the authors would have done better to choose a more ordinary family situation to explore rather than the tragic relationship between Mr. and Mrs. X. Mrs. X in particular is painted so one dimensionally that she becomes mere caracature .The subject matter here is ripe for exploration, but the authors blew it with exaggeration. The children they portray are the next generation of the Masters of the Universe--and if what these authors have to say about their upbringing is true, we're all in trouble. In the end, your heart breaks for Grayer and all the poor little rich kids like him."
2,Should be titled The Doormat Diaries,"This is a good book to read while you are commuting or on the beach. However, I found none of the characters sympathetic and Nanny was the most pathetic character of them all. If they write a sequel, I hope Nanny will develop a backbone."
3,its was just okay...,"You would have to be a Nanny to really appreciate this novel. For me it was a so-so read. Here is a summary without giving everything away. This chick is in college and gets a job as a part time nanny. The family is a well off, Park Avenue type family. And pretty much neither parent has time for the son. The mother is always busy with her volunteer work and shopping; dad is always, always at work, and wouldnt you know it...he is having an affair. While mom was at the spa the child gets sick no one can reach her, no one can find dad...what's a nanny to do? Overall the parents are too wrapped up in themselves to care for the only child and leaves it up to nanny. It would be a great read for nannies or those working in the field."
5,great book,"This book is one of my favorites. I've had several friends nanny in New York, and I know this story nails it. It is so entertaining, and you will get wrapped up in the story as if it is happening to you. I definetly recommend this book to anyone who can relate to the world of a nanny, or who is just looking for a good read."
2,Tale of a Co-dependent Martyr,"I absolutely hated this book. Oh sure, it was an easy, fast read, but the story was awful. How depressing! About how a wealthy Madison Avenue family mis-treats their child along with everyone else who works for them (particularly the Nanny). One would hope for revenge in the end but there is none. This book was a huge, aggravating, disappointment."
1,waste your time doing something else,"I heard this book on tape during one of my long drives . It was truly terrible. A very whiny book, with frankly not a very good story. For anybody who has lived in New York or in any major city none of the ""shocking"" aspects of how rich people live are very interesting. The themes keep on repeating themselves over and over. The character has no backbone. Amazing that this book can be a best seller. At least I got it at the public library for free. I would have kicked myself if I would have spent the money buying it."
3,Surprised,"I am very surprised this book is still on the best seller list. It is, at best, average; a quick semi-interesting read. I thought it would be a flash-in-the-pan & people would realize how average it is. I just wonder how it keeps on going...."
2,Overated!,"I took this book on vacation with me expecting to read a fun and mindless book. It was mindless that's for sure! I kept waiting for something exciting to happen...but it never did. I got the point, the rich folks never take care of their kids, the nanny always did, the nanny was treated as less than human...but give me more!!!"
2,Great talent vs. flat abridgement,"I've just finished listening to the Nanny Diaries. If the printed book had any evidence of being even-handed in the audio edition it is gone. The X's here are a collection of the flatest characters I've ever run across. It all seems to boil down to Nannies equals good, saintly surogate mother, Mr & Mrs X equal evil, self involved devils, and Grover is the innocent victum caught in the middle.Maybe this flatness is a result of the abridgement, but from what I heard, the title character of Stephen King's ""Christine"" had more emotional depth than 99.9% of the characters in this novel.All of this said, Julia Roberts did an excellent job reading and I'm glad to hear such first rate talent venturing into the audio book field.Unfornately, however, even such extraordinary talent can't breath originality into this cliched material.Maybe the unabridged, printed version was better. Let's hope so."
4,Amusing,"I found this book very easy to read because the way people behave can be so fascinating. A bit of a sad reflection on the attitudes of people and the effects upon their children, this book boldly shows just how bad those attitutes can be and the extent of rationalizing to justify how absurdly correct they want to be. The entertainment value of this book is high. It is very amusing and well worth reading. Enjoy!"
4,Loved it!,"I read it earlier this year and loaned it to two of my friends who also loved it. I really couldn't put it down! I am usually a Patricia Cornwell, thriller, mystery type. So this was a nice little change, although I was constantly frustrated with the nanny character, she was too nice!! I would have smacked Grayers mother!!!!"
2,Heartbreaking,"While I found this book difficult to put down, I disagree entirely with reviewers who find this to be a funny story. I find it tragic. What is funny about child neglect, rude behavior, and abusive treatment. My heart ached throughout this book for that sweet 4 year old boy."
5,The end of this book made me want to cry....,"This story not only depicts the bizarre relationship between a demanding, self-absorbed Park Avenue mother and her 4-year old son's nanny, but successfully portrays the loving bond that forms between the child and his caregiver. The end of this book truly tugged at my heartstrings."
1,kublai khan give me a large break,"Perhaps you can crawl out from under the rest of the ""novels'"" you read to realize that the people who don't like this book feel that way because it is ****badly****** written, not because of the subject matter."
5,Loved it!,"I really enjoyed the story- it was a fun, easy read that was incredibly realistic. So I'm not surprised this book has the elite of NYC pointing fingers up and down Park Ave as to who the real Mrs. X is. The reviews seemed to be based on whether Nanny was a snob- the truth is, if you were discussing Nanny's personality, her likes, dislikes, thoughts or feelings then you were absorbed by the book. And that, my friends, is the sign of a great book."
2,Not enough dish on the rich,"I am a practical person who bought this mostly to learn about what the life of the new york rich/society type was like. I did get some of that, but for every pound of dish I got 10 pounds of fairly dull story line.I did not find the book that funny, and ""Nan"" seems depressed and has a negative perspective on just about everything. Her life doesn't seem fun or interesting, and reading about it definitely wasn't, either."
1,Save your money,"I admit it, I bought this book because of all the hype. And I read it all hoping it would redeem itself.It didn't. Nanny is annoying and Mr. & Mrs. X should be put out of their misery. Grayer was the only endearing character in the whole book. Why would Nan continue to put up with the rotten antics of Mrs.X - a persona I hope I never meet in my life...what a waste of oxygen. Don't waste your time or money on this piece of literary junk."
5,under rated,"Gruntruck is one of the most underated bands of the early '90's. If you haven't heard them, buy this now. Their live show was amazing, and this disc will not disappoint."
5,thank god for seattle,"this album was one of my favorites back in the day. ive been trying to find it, with no luck, until now. the guitarist, and i believe the drummer are from my all time favorite hardcore band the Accused.....try finding them. gruntruck made good solid music, bordering on ""grunge"" but more like just good ""hard stuff"". the dudes in the band were definitely down to earth folks. as i said before a couple of the guys are from the accused. That band just reunited and are blazing the northwest music scene again. i say buy gruntruck and try to find some accused. the accused have a site splatterock.com"
3,"Join their ""Tribe"".","In short, they're one of the decent ""Seattle"" bands that didn't get well known in the 90's. Even bands like ""Tad"" and ""Green River"" were more popular. But they are good, maybe not ""Alice In Chains"" good, but still in the same neighborhood. Also, though you could call them grunge, they're more on the metal side of it. None of these songs sound like a hit, and the album probably isn't essential, but any fan of the genre should like it. You ""Gotta Believe"" me."
3,Goes Dull,I bought this to cut 26 gauge sheets for a metal building. It worked great for the first few cuts then it became dull. We were cutting up to 10 sheets at a time though. I resharpened it a couple of time to finish the job. Very noisy and wear your safety glasses.
3,"Great album, but is it really live?","I've always doubted the ""Live"" claim. It sounds like it was recorded live in a studio and the audience was added later, but they went a way too far over the top with it. It sounds like they're playing to an NFL stadium sized audience. Maybe if they'd dubbed in a club sized crowd I wouldn't have been suspicious at all. Listening to it now it just generates laughter. I hate that because the performance is actually pretty good, too bad they turned it into an ego piece..."
4,One of the best general frog books available.,"This book (hardcover) has a beautiful lay out, well written text (nice letter type !) and especially the stunning photography!This together makes it in my view one of the best (general) frog books on the market today.Please do note the word ""general"", the information is targeted at anyone with an interest in frogs in general, a broad audience.Which should work fine in this case."
5,Awesome Hole Saw Set,"Great hole saw set at an awesome price. At $60 (9/24/08 price)I got the entire set for the price of 2 hole saws alone! Used it to install venting for a tankless water heater and it cut through the wood and siding with no problem. Nice deep cut; not those cheap, shallow hole saws."
2,beautiful but terribly inaccurate,"I'm very disappointed in this product. Its beautiful to look at but is extremely slow to react. On a day where the real temp varies from 40 to 70 this thing will never move lower than 50 or higher than 60 and will always be at least 10 degrees behind the real temperature movement, sometimes 15 or 20 depending on the day. The actual mechanism is trapped behind the very heavy terra cotta facia and never really sees the true temperature of the day. Great decor, lousy thermometer. I'm going back to my ugly but accurate mercury thermometer."
3,It is a blade,"They were used one time, so it is hard to say anything about them. They were okay for a blade set."
4,"Good mix, but has a little something missing","I also would have liked to see Strawberry Fields and Revolution despite the fact that neither was a number one USA hit. Since the collection is not explicitly intended to be an American number one showcase, I must sadly refrain from giving it all of the stars.Part of the problem I have noticed with Beatles marketing in the US is that it attempts to ignore the fact these young men were European and therefore also wrote to that audience. Although the selection on the CD's are good, it could use a little more work and well roundedness.I am still glad I bought it though. ""Let It Be"" and ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" are two of my favirote songs and this is a nice mellow CD to relax with."
3,something's missing,"As someone who grew up with the Beatles, have to tell you that this is not what I expected. Granted, all these songs are great but there's something lost in the way they were packaged. I guess part of the appeal back then was hearing the next track, a new song unreleased. Here, we have songs that have been heard and played. Besides, putting these songs together in one package sort of ruins the flavor of the how the songs were first heard; on Abbey Road, we have ""Come Together,"" followed by ""Something."" Here's it's just the opposite. I've grown accustomed to hearing it in the reverse. It's that way for all the songs...all out of order...."
3,"ITS OK, BUT MISSING ALOT","This is a good album. but i found that the first 10 songs or so are not so great being that they were remastered, the mono versions were better. Sometimes the new is not always better than the old. Also alot of their best is left out, like there is no tracks from Sgt. Pepper's on there!!!"
5,review of a review,"I thought your "" Fab Four Minus One"" comment was rude, thoughtless and insensitive."
3,Dismayingly unadventurous,"The Beatles made some of the best music ever but even so, nobody needs another greatest hits album, particulary one as unadventurous as this. You probably own every song several times over already, and even if you are a newcomer looking for the best of the Beatles, some of the track choices here are highly questionable. ""Love me do"" instead of ""Please please me"" or ""You can't do that""? No ""Strawberry Fields""? ""The Ballad of John and Yoko"" but no ""Back in the USSR"" or ""Don't let me down""? Get outa here!"
3,"Can we have ""From Me To You"" in true stereo finally?","""From Me To You"" exists in true stereo so why not release it already? The mix sounds good! -I have it on rare foreign vinyl. Since this CD doesn't conform to a format of original mono and stereo single releases ""From Me To You"" in true stereo and ""Help!"" and ""Ticket To Ride"" in original mono single mixes would have made this a worthy addition to the Beatle CD collector who already has all the EMI CDs and Capitol 1 and 2 box sets. If you've got all the back catalogue already I can't see the point of buying this. Please release all the original historic mixes before flooding the market with new redundant product and new digital remasters! Not always does Digital Remaster = Good Product."
3,C'mon it's the beatles...,"But where the hell is ""in my life""? ""Lucy in the sky with diamonds""?! ""TWIST AND SHOUT"" FOR GOD'S SAKE!!! i know it must be hell to fit the best beatles cuts all on one album, which is why the greatest band in recorded music history deserves nothing less than an all inclusive 3 or 4 disc greatest hits collection at every attempt to make a greatest hits collection. nice try, but doesnt do them justice."
2,"Beatles are great, but Elv1s is simply the best!","Well, the Beatles are simpy the best as a group, but Elv1s is simply the best when it comes to music!It's simle as this Elv1s 30 #1 Hits is better than Beatles 27 #1 Hits combined!"
1,Beat(le)ing a Dead Horse,"Let's face it. If you don't have all these songs already, you probably don't like music. But if you buy this CD, which is essentially the record company's mix tape of ""everybody's favorite"" Beatles songs, you probably still don't like music. These are songs that most everyone can sing from memory. Why Capitol decided we needed yet another collection of Beatles hits is a mystery to me. Oh wait, I figured it out...THEY DID IT FOR THE MONEY. Why would you even consider buying this rubbish? Save your money and buy the original albums. Or better still, buy something new, by a new band, who need the money far more than Sir Paul, George or Ringo ever will. If Lennon was alive he'd tell you the same thing."
1,Disappointment,Rubbish. On several tracks the lyrics were not audible. Overall the tracks sounded like studio outtakes.My refund is awaited. I have only given 1star because the system won't let me give ZERO.
4,Generally Good,"I think the songs they chose for this CD were good except there is one dissapointment: THEY DID NOT PUT LUCY IN THE SKY WITH DIAMONDS ON IT. That is my favorite Beatles song. Also, they put too many of the early songs on it and not enough of the psychadelic songs, which I like better. Oh well, it's still a good CD and does have a lot of good songs on it."
3,Things could be better,It has a good selection... It could be a lot better. I did think that they could've switched some sogns around to really make it something. I like the last 15 best... never been to much of a beatles fan...as far as their early days...ok..so go buy something else...like and Eric Clapton CD...
1,Pretty Bad,"This album doesn't contain Strawberry Fields Forever, I Am The Walrus, or A Day In The Life. Full stop."
1,POINTLESS,"The band Crowded House had a lyric in a song a few years ago that said something about ""trying to catch the deluge in a paper cup"", and that's what this CD reminds me of. Any attempt to distill the essence of the Beatles on a single-disc ""greatest hits""-type thing is to do everyone a great disservice. Trust me folks: the Beatles experience must be heard in its entirety or you're gonna be missing a whole lot of magic. CDs like this one exist only to make record label presidents even richer than they already are -- please don't encourage this ugly practice by buying this lame release."
1,Dire Straits are a billion times better!,"Well folks, the Beatles are one of the most overrated bands of all time. They don't make anything melody, or guitar solos..theyare only meant for babies!!! This is a pure lousy compilation with lousy songs like I WANT TO HOLD YOUR HAND. Avoid the reviewer SABBATH BLOODY SABBATH and get Dire Straits insted. They are a billion times better!"
1,"WAY OVERRATED, GET NIRVANA INSTED","This CD I feel is overrated! I've listened to the BEATLES for about a month and realized that their music was equally lame. Anyone who loves the Beatles are a discrace. They don't make anything Decent. They are just an overrated 60's band just likePink Floyd, and Rolling Stones. Avoid this and get Nirvana Nevermind insted.the beatles suck the beatles suck the beatles suck the beatles suck the beatles suck the beatles suck the beatles suck the beatles suck the beatles suck.......WAITING FOR A GIRL LIKE YOU"
2,Overrated!,I know I am in the minority...but the Beatles' success was a product of their era; overrated! They would never make it today! A couple good songs that are only good because they remind me of a good movie or commercial. Don't bother if you were curious like I was.
2,What A Dissapointing Greatest Hits Album.....,"This is a really lame dissapointing compilation...plus these guysonly made like 3 or 4 good songs. I listened to them for about amonth listening to 4 different albums and man...they are really bad. The Beatles don't make good music, period. They are just an overrated, lame, stupid 60's pop band which pop music sucks! Trythese bands Dire Straits, Green Day, or even Guns N' Roses. Theyrock plus they are probably the greatest bands of all time. And I just don't get it why people like THE BEATLES so much. 25 LAME SONGS....AND TWO GOOD SONGS AND THE GOOD SONGS ARE HEY JUDE (WHICH IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE GREATEST SONGS EVER), AND BALLADOF JOHN AND YOKO. This band is junk.....throw away, and avoid all albums from Beatles.Everyone...read my review.ps: Listen to Dire Straits Tunnel of Love insted."
1,What is this?,"I am a 55 year old man and in all my years Ive have never heard of the ""Beatles?""A bunch of British guys trying to Rock n'Roll. I hear that they're suppose to be the best band of all time. Hello! Aaron Carter. Please if you are an anti Beatles person look up Billy Gilman. Now that is a true artist."
1,Metallica is much better than this!!,"Too bad I can't go even more below one star. The Beatles are one of the worst bands I have ever heard. They are lousy, stupid, overrated, and lame. This album only has 1 good song in Ballad Of John and Yoko. Rest of the other songs are bad! Metallica ismuch better than this..go get Ride The Lightning, Master of Puppets, and Black Album insted and don't listen to the 5 starreviewers of this pathetic disaster.PS. BEATLES AND PINK FLOYD ARE PURE TRASH SO AVOID ALL ALBUMSFROM THOSE BANDS."
5,My Kids Are Now Big Beatles Fans!,"My wife bought this CD for my birthday. I never anticipated it, but playing The Beatles 1 turned my (elementary school age) kids into big Beatles fans.The songs they like most are ""Love Me Do,"" ""Can't Buy Me Love,"" and ""All You Need Is Love."" But their absolute favorite is ""Yellow Submarine"" which they sing at the top of their lungs in the car whenever the song comes on.The Beatles just prove that beautiful songs are timeless.It always warms my heart to think that I am broadening my kids' horizons (and that we now have something I can listen to on family driving vacations that's a little more sophisticated than 'N Sync and The Backstreet Boys).Show your kids that music did exist before they were born -- by introducing them to The Beatles 1. (It will make you seem, in their eyes, years younger.)"
4,Number 1,"My wife love the Beatles, and mentioned that she would really love a Beatles album for our long drives.I looked up a few, this seemed the best, so i bought it.I was not disappointed, a lot of really great tracks, and great value!Very happy with the purchase!"
5,"Amazing and Incredible to me, a first time listener.","I've pratically shunned out anything except violin music since I play the darned thing... My Mom wanted this CD for Christmas, so I picked it up, and now I can't stop listening to it! I can't explain it, these guys were (and still are/would be) talented and innovative music makers. Man, this stuff is awesome! I'm 16, and just today I had it jamming in my friend's car!No one compares to their musical power!Long live the Beatles!"
2,"Good Songs, bad recordings","I have been listening to this for a while as one of the only Beatles CDs I have, and until 'Sgt. Pepper's' and 'Let It Be' came into my posession and I really got into the Beatles, I thought it was pretty good. Then, after I finished comparing them, I realized, for one thing, that those were definitely not the best recordings of the songs, and for anoher, it sounds like Paul McCartney turned up his bass sound so loud you can't hear any of the song. In conclusion, if you're strapped for cash, and must have the most Beatles you can get, buy it, but if you have a few more bucks to spend, go for albums like 'Sgt. Pepper', 'Let it Be', 'Abbey Road', 'Magical Mystery Tour' and 'Please Please Me'."
5,golden collection,"The CD contains all no. 1 hits done by the world's no. 1 group. It's true that they are not the best 27 songs done by them, but certainly a memorable collection. No doubt that all the songs are atleast good. I like ""I wanna hold your hand"" so much.Only Problem seems to be everybody has listen these songs so many times, but listen one more time, you will say you still like these songs. I bought this CD without listening only 2 songs (""eight days a week"", ""penny lane""). The rest I have listened (more or less) 40 times each, but when i started listening, it was the same old (Beatles) magic. They were such an easylistening group, that's why everybody loves them, starting from one who listens AC/DC to one who listens MC Hammer. Another plus point of this CD is its sleeve designing, it has pretty good color combination."
2,Yet another useless anthology,I'm a BIG Beatles' fan but I really DON'T like this CD. If you own all the 13 cds + past masters + 3 anthology + ep and singles collections + free as a bird and real love I want to ask you one thing: why buy this cd only to read the (very fine) booklet? No 'please please me' in stereo; no 'from me to you' without harm intro (in past masters 1 there's 'love me do' 1st version with Ringo!). I think they could sell just the cover of this cd. NOT THE CD.
1,"Get the albums, forget these useless compilations.","Without a doubt, The Beatles are my very favorite group. I own all their music. The problem I have with compilations is what every true Beatle fan knows; you can't separate or cherry pick their albums. For instance, Penny Lane and Strawberry Fields should never be separated. And those songs can't be truly appreciated apart from their friends on the Magical Mystery Tour. Plus, these are not necessarily, The Beatles ""best"" songs, only their most popular. If you are interested in getting into The Beatles, buy the Rubber Soul or/and Revolver CDs. Then go back to Help or forward to The White Album or Abby Road. Don't give this CD a second thought."
4,Still The 1,"What is most amazing here is the fact that even if these 27 former #1 songs never existed, The Beatles would still be considered the greatest rock band of all. Twenty seven No.1 songs and what sticks out is what is NOT on here--nothing from Sgt. Pepper (considered by many to be ""the best"" album of the rock era), nothing from the White Album (considered by others to be ""the best""), nothing from Rubber Soul (our personal favorite), and only 2 songs (Eleanor Rigby, and the novelty Yellow Submarine) from the classic Revolver. No ""In My Life"", no ""For No One"", no ""You've Got to Hide Your Love Away"", or countless other favorites. This album is just 27 songs that will jolt your memory, alert your kids, bond you to your neighbor, put a grin on your face, a swivel in your hips, and joy in your heart. And that'snot bad."
4,"Not bad, but some of the best songs were left off!!","I love the Beatles. Few people can honestly say that they don't like the Beatles. This album is pretty good, but let me show you the songs I would put on here, in no particular order.1.Hey Jude2.Here Comes the Sun3.Blackbird4.Strawberry Fields Forever5.Ob-La-Di Ob-La-Da6.Help!7.Got to Get You Into My Life8.Yellow Submarine9.I Saw Her Standing There10.Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds11.Sgt.Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band12.Penny Lane13.Drive My Car14.Good Day Sunshine15.Hard Day's Night16.Twist and ShoutThose aren't the only ones you would need to put on the perfect Beatles CD, but those should definetly be in there."
5,A Swarm of Beatle Hits,"Yes, as another reviewer mentioned, this band is overrated, and I never thought I'd be buying this CD in a million years, but I love it. Having missed the Beatle infestation the first time around, none of these songs bring back memories, but songs like ""Paperback Writer"" have become my anthem!! I heard it in the music store and had to buy it simply for that song, but I've come to love the rest of the songs too. This is the only Beatles CD I own, and I don't plan on buying any others, but it's definitely going to spin a few times in my player. Definitely a wise investment!"
3,Get the two-disk sets,"I rate this 3 stars, not because it's an average release but because it's an unnecessary release with what was already out there before."
3,Beatles 1,"How can people criticize this CD? Unlike any other Beatle album, it actually has 14 good songs on it! One of the better Beatle CDs! 3-stars!"
4,BEATLES,"I do not thing that anyone was better than the Beatles. Many were very close, but not quite there."
2,"Buy ""Abbey Road"" instead...","You can't really dislike the Beatles' music, in any combination. This album, however, is not a great ""must have"" masterpeice, and it's hardly a good introduction to the Beatles as well. If you want to see if you like their music, or if you want a taste of their undoubted geniusee, save your money and buy ""Abbey Road"" instead, the actual albums are a lot better than any collection."
3,Not much to get excited about here,"I was lead to believe that not only would we get the singles, but the original (mono) single mixes. I could have made this CD myself. The digital remastering is always going to get better as the years go by, but it's so frustrating that the very people who have access to the catalog keep putting out such short-sighted drivel. I absolutely hate the stereo ""I Want To Hold Your Hand"". The separation of voices & music equals zero impact, and leads one to ask what the big deal was with these guys to begin with. These guys helped invent pop music, and they deserve better (and yeah, of course McCartney had all the #1 hits, but not all the best songs). Silly."
4,A New Fan is born,"Over the past few years I've slowly been getting more interested in the Beatles music. So when this compilation came out I thought what could be a better introductin to them? Well, I finally got it and I'm very glad I did.I already knew a fair amount of the music before buying it, so I was most interested in hearng the new (for me) songs. So imagine my surprise when I discovered that all those songs I thought I knew sounded so much more rich than I remembered. I was captivated by the topics and melodis of Paperback Writer, The Ballad of John and Yoko and Penny Lane and many others.I don't like every song on the CD, but it did it's job in re-inroducing me to old favorites and getting me interested in buying more music. I'm now in a total Beatles fixation and have bought Sgt. Pepper's with the plan to buy more. Looks like I'm starting a magical sonic journey!"
5,"Welcome to Beatlemania via 200""1""","From their Backstreet Boys days with ""Love Me Do"" to there more poignant ballads (""Eleanor Rigby"") this is an extensive, if not comprehensive, collection of what made the Beatles the super gruop of the century. It chronicles nicely their evolution, and is an excellent primer in the influences that effect artists down to today. For teens and young adults just getting into classice rock, this is a superb first purchase. It also makes a convenient ""background mucic, long car ride"" cd for oldtimers of the classic rock genre."
4,Awesome Collection of Great Songs,"What a great compilation! One of the best I've heard. ""Yesterday,"" ""Hey Jude"" and ""Eleanor Rigby"" are my definite favs, but the others sound great as well.On a side note, I think this compilation would have benefited from a few different song choices (the first several can be a bit of a chore to sit through when you know what's coming up.)Two thumbs up from me!"
3,rehash and repackage,"I am not a fan of repackaging of old material and making a ""new"" disc. All these beatles songs are great, but I own all the albums already & I ask you, do you think Paul, George, Ringo and Yoko need more $? Only buy this if you dont own all the albums or you are heavy into comps."
2,Could Have Been Better.....,"Well, I have been a beatles fan for 13 years (all my life) I was brought up on the beatles albums my dad owned and I loved them. I now have nearly all the beatles albums, and this was one that I got last Christmas. It was a great compilation of all the best Beatles songs, but you get bored of them after a bit, because they are ALL the songs off the albums, it is a nice album with great songs, but it doesn't really show off all the beatles talents with them trying out new styles of music. So It's not great, but I like it..."
4,Would Have Been Great...,"If you're a fan of the Beatles, don't get mad because of the 4 stars. I have all the CD's, including this one, and I like all these songs, but this isn't one of the CD's the Beatles made-it's a copy. A copy is never as good as the original. There's a difference between, let's say, ""Ticket to Ride"" on the CD ""Help"" than on the CD ""Beatles 1"". That's all, folks! (he-he) : )(...)"
5,I love The Beatles,"Even though I have seen them on tv and heard the music on the redio I love there music and I love this cd it has all the songs I love , if you don't know who the beatles are or you do get this cd it is cool"
3,Reviews of the Day?,"I'm disappointed to see that both of the posted ""Reviews of the Day"" happen to ignore the music on this CD and instead focus on criticizing the opinions of other reviewers.There is no doubt that the Beatles were an above-average pop band. They released some great work (Abbey Road) as well as some sub-standard work (Mystery Tour).Now for the review of this CD: It's a quasi-representative sampler of their catalog, falling short because there are no tracks here that weren't released as singles. Oh yeah, I'm old enough that I saw all of this happen. Athough now it's legendary, back then it wasn't that great. 3-stars."
5,Something You May Have Missed,"To me the audio is much improved over previous Beatles CDs. An important note....here is the first CD stereo version of ""A Hard Day's Night""."
2,A Big Disappointment,"I just got this CD. Although it has all the # 1 songs, I was hoping they would be the original 45 RPM mixes, and not the LP stereo mixes. It would be nice to have them available without having to purchase the CD single box set.... The version of Help is the one from the LP and not the single version. The 45 RPM version has never been released on CD except for the CD single. Nothing new here except the packaging, and even that is not very immaginative."
5,The Beatle's Beat out BackSteetBoys,"The Beatles are number 1 in Billboard this week,beating out the BackStreetBoys new Album,""Black and Blue."" I have listened to there new record,and enjoyed it,but the Beatles will live on forever.27 number 1 hits,and everyone written by the band."
3,Is it the name that dissapoints people?,"Don't get me wrong, because I absolutely love the Beatles. But even though these songs may be #1 songs, there are many, in my opinion, better Beatles songs than these songs. Maybe the name of the CD could have been Beatles 2000, or something else and then they could have put in all the other good songs they did that weren't necessarily #1s. For example, ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"", ""Fool on the Hill"", ""Strawberry Fields"", etc... It just seems like I could have bought one of those K-Mart greatest Beatles Hits and had the same set of songs on that."
3,No original singles mixes other than two songs,"Look, another reviewer has mentioned original mono single mixes on this release, but there are none other than ""From Me to You"" and ""She Loves You"". ""Hey Jude"" is not in mono, and ""Revolution"" isn't even on this CD! ""Love Me Do"" is mono, but not the original single mix, and the rest are all in glorious stereo, which is how almost none of them were ever heard originally, and the mono mixes rock. Don't buy this if you think you're going to be getting the original mixes!"
3,"Great music, but...","This isn't a vital addition to The Beatles canon, just another compilation. This is really only for the ultra neophite, casual fan or completist. Even for the beginer I would reccomend starting with ""Please Please Me"" and going on from there. As far as compilations go the red and blue sets are more comprehensive. Collectors will already have this material (in better forms, I might add). The biggest issue I have with this set is the sound quality. It is so doused in noise reduction it nearly drowns, totally sucking the life out of the performances (the tapes were never that noisy to warrant this proceedure). In short it is dreadful. Go with the full albums. Even better, go with the original 60's UK vinyl."
4,"listen up kids, think this cd's great? just wait....",Sure this has got some great songs. But here's the truth: buy the white album and abbey road. Once you listen to THOSE two cd's you'll forget you even own this one. THEY'RE THAT GOOD!
1,NoNoise is evil!!!!!!!,"Good idea. God-awful mastering. Every song was NoNosied to death. In a misguided attempt to remove the tape hiss, the music was destroyed. It even sounds bad on a boom box, much less a decent stereo system. This music could be mastered well, but the guys at Abbey Road are to in love with new gee whiz technology to do it right. Everything the Beatles did was recorded using Electron Tube equipment, and should be remastered with the same kind of equipment. The only way for you to hear the music on CD as it was meant to sound is to hunt down a mint copy of one of their original LPs and burn your own CD or buy a Bootleg sourced from the original vinyl."
3,Strange,"While this is a very bizarre way to package up the Beatles, I do give it credit for opening up their music to a lot of kids today. Almost everyone in my eighth grade class has this CD and listens to it, which seems downright strange, considering how only a select few knew any Beatles songs before. But it's such a weird way to compile the hits! As a few people have pointed out, it skips over everything in Sgt. Pepper's (which, while not my favorite album, has some really important music on it), the white album, and I think Rubber Soul. Please Please Me isn't on it, which I thought was a number one. To someone who's known the Beatles this is very odd to listen to. A lot of my friends stopped thinking I was completely crazy and went out and bought some of the albums, so it can't be all bad! : )"
5,Great Sypnosis of the Beatles' Period of History,"I think that this is a great collection of some of the Beatle's hits. This is the first Beatles CD I have owned, and was very pleased at what I bought. The songs I had not heard before were refreshingly new, and the ones that I had heard, were as if I were hearing for the first time all over again. This is a wonderful choice for anyone who doesn't own a Beatles CD, or a good addition to a collection."
3,The Beatles,"The Beatles made several hundred songs. Some you love. Some you don't. You know which are which. So swing on by a music store or a website and see what's on this CD. And, since you've heard every single one of these songs before, and you know what you do and don't own, you know if you want this or not. For me to actually ""review"" this 1/ONE/one would be a big waste of time. I bought it because I was Beatle-less. Damn nasty of Paul and Yoko to include only one song written by George, and to make it one I don't like. No Taxman, no Here Comes The Sun...{""She loves you, yes yes yes."" That was suggested by the father of one of the Four. Paul, I think. An English teacher, at any rate. It sounds quite stupid, doesn't it? He obviously never wrote dialog.}"
4,That's a lot of songs!,27 #1 hits! That's a lot of songs! Too bad it couldn't include top 5 songs but could you imagine how songs that would be????The cover booklet is great. Imagaes of the album covers and record covers are priceless.The Beatles are definitely one of the best bands ever to have recorded music.
3,Prospective fans only,"You only need to buy this if you only want one Beatles album (though if you want two: abbey road and white album!). You'd be much better off buying all of them (slow and evpensive but more rewarding), they all have their own unique charm which is lost in a mix tape of their best. Also, if you still have a record player buy all your Beatles albums on LP, they really do sound better!"
3,May be #1 but not the Beatles' best works,"POP music at it's finest,take it as an insult or compliment but it's true.This album lists the songs that topped the charts but doesn't necessarily represent the Beatle's best work.A lot of great tracks are missing from this fairly decent album and filled with alot of super-catchy 2 minute love songs that don't properly show what the Beatles were all about.The good thing about this album is that the tracks are in chronilogical order so you know what NOT to listen to on the album,like almost all of the first half which contains all of the bad love cliches that you can catch on the radio over and over again.But on the other half of this album contains some classics that may never be recreated(such as ""Let It Be"")or covered properly(but nice try with ""Revolution"" Stone Temple Pilots).This album is worth a listen but is not really anything more than a list of easy tracks to help 1st time listeners get into The Beatles."
3,"Great Album, Not for Beatles Fans","The Beatles are my favorite band and the songs on this album are some of the best I've ever heard. So why did I give this album three stars? Simple answer. If the Beatles want to start digitally remastering their music, let's have it. I think it's a great idea and I'll be the first in line to buy each of the remastered albums. But I'm not going to buy the ""hits"" album to get a ""preview"" of the remastered sounds, and then shelve the album in perpetuity once the album remasters come out. This release is marketing and nothing more. Only six years ago the Beatles released a two-volume greatest hits album on CD. I understand they're the greatest band ever; but a greatest hits album every five years, with the same music???Having said that, if you like but don't love the Beatles, I suppose this one is worth the while."
5,'The Beatles 1',"This CD is fantastic! They compiled all the Beatles best songs onto 1 compact disc. It includes my favorites: Day Tripper, Hello-Goodbye, and the Ballad of John & Yoko. I highly recommend you buying this classic. It is worth every red cent."
5,The Best CD ever,This was the best CD i have ever heard all year. mabye even in my life. I highly recommend it.
5,#1 for a reason,"Okay, I'll keep it simple:There are 27 reasons enclosed herein why you, me, and everyone else in the nation ducked into a nearby music store to get this. Maybe time travel is possible: just drop on, tune in, and away you go, back to memories that curl the corners of your mouth and make us laugh. Was music always this much fun? Life is art and art is life; these songs made us hear with our eyes and see with our ears."
5,Timeless,"Have been listening to the Beatles anyway - as a matter of fact, I've been picking up the rare, demos and bootlegs from the Internet and doing my own compilation CDs. I also own ""all"" their albums/CDs plus the Red and Blue, Live at the BBC, the three Anthologies...I also listen to new music from today's popular artists.I dreaded the release of ""1"" but thought I ought to have it, don't ask me why! I actually waited 2 days before I opened the package. Once I slipped it into my CD player, I was back in time - actually, it was more like time in suspension - not backwards or ahead - it was simply music that transcend... nothing seemed old, nothing seemed irrelevant.The Beatles has created music that will be a part of everything in everywhere for everyone for all time! What is this five star thing?"
5,Amazing...,"This album was my first exposure to the Beatles. I bought it a couple years ago. I can honestly say that it is possibly one of the best albums I've ever heard. EVERY single song on the album is good. I can't think of one that's bad. If I HAD to pick some favorites I'd go with ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"", ""Eight Days a Week"", ""Paperback Writer"", ""Eleanor Rigby"", ""Penny Lane"", ""All You Need is Love"", ""Lady Madonna"", ""Something"", and ""Let it Be"". But for me, it's like splitting hairs.I recntly also bought another album by the Beatles: Rubber Soul. I thought that it was absolutely amazing. I'm surprised that none of them made it onto this CD. But then again, it's just their #1's, so I guess I can't really fault them with that. Well, all in all, If you're like me, and you want to get into the Beatles, this album is a great place to start, you won't regret it. And then, if you really like it, I would also recommend Rubber Soul, which doesn't have any of the same songs."
2,Great Music but..,"I love the Beatles and these are some of their best songs, but I definitely wouldn't recommend this CD. Buy the red (Beatles/1962-1966) and blue albums (Beatles/1967-1970), yes its more expensive, but it has all these songs, plus a whole lot more."
3,not for real beatles fans,"beatles 1 is a great collection of hits, highlighting incredible songs that characterize the beatles as most people know them. the hits range from the early turn of beatles stardom and into the final stages. however, the album, being a compilation of #1 hits, doesn't capture the true essence of the beatles or hint at their artistic growth over time. great album, but if the beatles mean more to you than top-40, then this album might not satisfy your urge for the musical essence of the beatles."
3,All You Need Is Beatles #1,"Finally, we can get all the Beatles songs that we like on one CD. I've always found that the Beatles were great songwriters but that all of their songs were hit-or-miss. This album gathers up all the hits and delivers them in a neat package. Get it!"
4,Please Please Me?,"This is a very good compilation, although nothing new for big fans that already have all The Beatles original recordings, it shows the new generations the great talent of the Fab Four. It also makes you think how in the old days a group could take so many songs up to number one, unlike today that a gruop with a number one hit practically disappears the next month.I just don't understand one thing about 1: I've always known that Please Please Me was their first number 1 hit. So where is it? If anybody knows why this title was excluded, please please let me know at beni1976@hotmail.com"
3,Where is Please Please Me?,"Why isn't Please Please Me included on this set? It was the Beatles FIRST number one record in England. Lets not forget that they are from Liverpool, England, and started their careers there before conquering America. I notice Love Me Do is on the list. Love Me Do was released before Please Please Me, did respectably, but was not the huge hit they needed. Then they put out Please Please Me and the rest is history. Please Please Me should be on this album. That's the only reason I give this three stars."
5,"Go ahead, get it!!","Too many people we know have said they want this album, but 'shouldn't' get it because there's nothing new about it.If you're a Beatles fan, and/or you belong to the Baby Boomer generation, this is another Beatles album you must add to your collection (of Beatles music or nostalgic tunes).Unless you mix your own CD's, this is a great way to have the most popular Beatles songs from the beginning of their reign all there for you, ready to enjoy. We have the blue and red albums, but want to add this one too. The songs we really long to listen to are all on this one, the sound is clearer and crisper than on the originals.So, go ahead and treat yourself and a friend. Enjoy!"
4,Great compilation; lacks continuity of individual albums,"This album is clearly a great compilation of hits; however it lacks the overall mood set by the individual albums. However, it is a great album for casual fans who may not wish to invest the time or money to acquire these songs from their original albums."
5,The Beatles - '1' (Capitol),"Review no. 1000. Whew! This is a privilege. An absolute must-have for any and all true Beatles fans. All 27 of the Fab Four's number one hits. They're all here. Tunes I haven't heard very much in recent years. Cuts like ""Love Me Do"", ""Eight Days A Week"", the guitar gem ""Day Tripper"", ""Yellow Submarine"", ""All You Need Is Love"" among others make this release hard to resist. Essential."
1,the 'F'-word,"I been playen this cd over and over and what I am left with is just one exclemation: the 'F'-word!The world must be doing something wrong, liking such nonsense muzak. Give me Elvis'20 days and 20 nogts or Townes Van Zandt's Flying shoes and I give you Gram Parsons I must be smebody else you've known and Cheap Tricks greatest.This 'one' gets 1 star!, OK?your son"
1,ONE STAR IS APPROPRIATE FOR THIS AWFUL BAND,"I HATE THE BEATLES. THEY ARE AMONGST ONE OF MY TOP 20 WORST BANDS OF ALL TIME. THEY PRODUCED SEVERAL REALLY BAD ALBUMS JUSTLIKE THIS ONE WITH 25 WORST SONGS I HAVE EVER HEARD. I LISTENED TO THEM FOR ABOUT A MONTH AND THOUGHT, NO MORE!!! THEY PURE SUCK.THEY HAVE ONLY MADE 1 DECENT SONG IN BALLAD OF JOHN AND YOKO BUTREST, URRGHHH!!!! LOVE ME DO HAS TO BE THE WORST SONG EVER RECORDED. I'M AFRAID, GO GET METALLICA INSTED. THIS IS FOR PEOPLE WITH NO TASTE. 1 STAR FOR THIS BAND, AVOID ALL THE ALBUMS OF THIS BAND. THANKS."
1,Old music,"Not sure why this is out now, except for the record company to make money. Good music, recorded 40 yrs ago."
1,Overrated Group,The beatles are overrated. All 27 songs on this Worthless album should be put in a historic studio. How can anyone like the beatles anymore?
1,TRASH,"The Beatles are in my opinion one of the worst bands ever, why are they so popular? They have only made 2 decent songs in Hey Jude, and Ballad Of John and Yoko. YELLOW SUBMARINE HAS TO BE ONE OF THE LOUSIEST SONGS I HAVE EVER HEARD. THIS IS EVEN WORSETHAN GREEN DAY. BUY THIS IF YOU DON'T KNOW MUSIC BUT GOOD MUSICIS FOREIGNER GOT IT? THEN SHUT UP...ALL BEATLES ALBUMS SUCK SO AS ALL ALBUMS FROM OTHER REALLY BAD BANDS LIKE ACDC ROLLING STONES LED ZEPPELIN AND PINK FLOYD. THANKS, AND DON'T READ THE 5 STAR REVIEWERS FOR THIS TERRIBLE DISASTER."
2,"Get outta here, Joans!","c'mon get outta here Joans, only 3 good tracks here: Rocking Roll Muzic, Besame Mucho and The Pill Song, the rest is oops my mum!peter barf"
4,great buy for everyone even the die hard fans,"I own loads of Beatles stuff and wondered if there was a point in buying this collection. There definately is. First, although I've listened to all of these songs over and over, it is awe inspiring to hear their entire career slotted into 70 or so minutes. They did it all and you hear it in this disk. The remastering of the tracks is another reason to get it. They obviously did a rush job on some of the songs, but overall the sonics are markedly improved. (Not as good as the remixed Yellow Submarine though!-don't expect that) The booklet is nice but could have had far more goodies. Still it's nice to see most of the single covers collected in one spot. Finally, we get some songs in stereo on Cd that we haven't had yet! I Want to Hold Your Hand, She Loves You, and other early tracks like AHDN have been released in mono only and appear here in a legit release for the first time."
2,Something Is Wrong With The General Population,"First of all, the music of the Beatles is so ingrained in the Western Culture, many people have been conditioned to like them. Second of all, this album has nothing to do with their music. ""The Beatles 1"" has everything to do with marketing. And guess what, the general population fell for it!! This album is going to be the highest selling ever. It has everything to do with getting inside people's pocketbooks and making money, rather than producing good music. Anyone with any sense in business knows that anything containing the word ""Beatles"" is going to sell well. Congratulations people, you have fell for another marketing ploy."
4,"""One"" Beatle gets all the glory?","This is a fantastic collection of the creative genius demonstrated from 1962 to 1970 - by Paul McCartney. I'm going to wait for the one that showcases the #1 singles that showcase Lennon's voice and songwriting; this CD, strangely, only has a couple of token Lennon numbers. It's obvious which ex-Beatle made the track selections..."
1,1 for 1,"This album's title is ""1"". Therefore, it gets 1 star.If you believe that the product you are reviewing is unsafe, please report this information to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) or contact Amazon.com directly."
3,Just 2.5 stars for a portable CD,"I didn't hoped more than I got from this CD. I bought it just to have a CD to be carried in my car. I'm not a Beatle fanatic, I just like their music. I'm sure truly fans don't feel excited with this appearance because they know this album doesn't contain many other wonderful songs (maybe they didn't reach a Number 1 on Top Tens but they were outstanding also), so this is just a nice compilation.As a music fan, I'd recommend this album, for those people who want to hear The Beatles' music, but I think that won't be the same impression for those millions real Beatles fans.That's all: It's a nice CD, no more than that."
1,Please don't buy this!,"If you are human, you will not buy this album(or any other Beatles record). You want to hear real Beatles, find some vinyl at a used record store, burn a friend's copy, or at the very worst, dowload it from your favorite audio service.Think of it this way, every album of this you buy, Michael Jackson gets one step closer to another facelift, another 100 hundred acres of land, and a new activity center for Bubbles. The absolute worst, it give him chance to make new album. Can your conscience bare that kind of misery. I know I can't. Thank God I work at the library. So much easier burn copies that way."
1,Unnecessary,"Nothing more here than an attempt by George, Paul, and Ringo to squeeze more money out of the buying public with some very tired songs that are ready for retirement. Honestly, do we need to hear Penny Lane, Love Me Do, Yesterday, Come Together, or Let It Be any more? All these songs already appear on the '62-66 and '67-70 compilations.A better idea would've been to release a Beatles album of some of the lesser known gems featuring songs like: If I Fell, Tell Me Why, You're Gonna Lose That Girl, If I Needed Someone, You Won't See Me, The Night Before, And Your Bird Can Sing, I've Got a Feeling, Things We Said Today, Golden Slumbers Medley, Oh Darling, I Me Mine, Being For the Benefit of Mr. Kite, Dear Prudence, and Glass Onion."
1,Beatles still on TOP,"I gave this one star so people would look at the truth. This deserves about 100 stars. The Beatles genious songwriting skills have proved that they are a band that has withstiood the test of time. Oh sure, bands like aerosmith, and Metallica, they to have become popular and been out for 10 + years. That nowa days is something that is amazing in itself. The Beatles however have gone for 40 years, and are still the best and may be forever the best creators of any rock that has ever lived. People say this Cd is a waste of time and money. Thats because nowadays people will listen to anything that has the F word used more than 2 times, and think that that is cool. This CD is a collection of some of the best songs ever made, go ahead and say o my band is cooler than yours, and that the Beatles are nothing but a waste of money... Well look whos sold who out."
1,it lasted 2 months,the sound quality was great. very vintage as it should be... but only for two months. now the songs get stucked...
3,"Good, but not quite the ultimate beatles album.","Although this CD contains many of the beatles earliest hits, it lacks their later more experimental/trippy works. Someone bought this for me as a gift and i returned it and bought Sgt. Peppers lonely Hearts Club Band. This album lacks the diversity that it should have, it definitely covers the early hits, but it doesn't have some of my favorites like, I am the walrus, Lucy in the sky with diamonds, Sgt. Pepper's lonely heart club band, Strawberry fields forever, etc. This album is for someone who has just started listening to the beatles and enjoys their more poppie years."
3,Not All The Beatles #1's,"Please Please Me and Strawberry Fields Forever were both #1 on the British Melody Maker chart. Twist and Shout was # 1 on the U.S. Cash Box and Record World charts. Nowhere Man was # 1 on the U.S. Record World chart. So the Beatles 1 CD is not truly representative of all The Beatles # 1 hits in the U.S.A. and England. These are hard facts that can be easily looked up on the internet! Elvis Presley's CD of # 1 hits took all charts on both sides of the Atlantic into account, don't Beatle fans deserve the same consideration or was this more Paul McCartney history revision as the songs mentioned above are all associated with John Lennon???"
3,Quality isn't the only sore spot -- track listing as well.,"With 27 tracks, I would've changed so many track selections on this CD. Sure, everyone has a couple personal favorites that missed the boat. But what about ""Twist and Shout"" and ""Strawberry Fields"". Those are timeless Beatles tracks.I'm also a fan of the Beatles later, less ""poppy"" work which I don't feel was adequately represented by this collection. Too many annoying early songs. Perhaps I had to be alive in the 60s to truly appreciate those.The Beatles + 27 tracks - some poor selections - poor quality versions = 3 stars."
4,It does what it sets out to do. . .,". . .and that is to present, in one album, all the Beatles' #1 hits.Some of these hits are better than others; some of my favorites were never (apparently) #1 hits!It's interesting: only one of the songs presented is a George Harrison original, (the rest being Lennon/McCartney) demonstrating that Harrison's talent was unappreciated in his day, and that he was definitely overshadowed by his band-mates.I also find it interesting that the largest bulk of #1 hits comes from the Beatles' early years, before they got strung out on booze, dope, and Eastern mysticism. Very little music from this phase of their career is represented. Then, at the very end of their career together, when they resumed doing truly innovative music, the #1 hits started coming back.Anyhow, while not every song will appeal to every fan (I could have done without ""Lady Madonna"" and ""The Ballad of John and Yoko"") the true Beatles' fan will want a copy of this album."
4,Having a Beatles #1 collection is great!,"Ah, yet another Beatles album - this time a collection of #1 hits! This is a good CD but the Beatles #1 hits are by far *NOT* their best work. Songs like ""Norwegian Wood"", ""In My Life"", ""Strawberry Fields Forever"" and tons of others easily top the #1 hits. But with that aside, there are some great songs on here - that, unfortunatly, haven't been remastered as was reported before album release. It's a great record to own, however, because of the sheer number of songs! :)"
5,You've heard it before,"If you've bought the previous collections, the ones named 1962-1966 (the Red Album) and 1967-1970 (the Blue Album), all the songs in this album are already in there, same performance and everything. These are not even necessarily the best. For example, I'd remove Ticket To Ride, and add And I Love Her.But, it's the Beatles, hey! they're always good."
4,You will know these songs.,"Instead of telling you how much I know about the Beatles and having you think of me as a pompous record geek, I am going to tell you two things about this album:1. You will know every track on this album and will likely be able to sing along with it right out of the wrapper.2. There are seminal pieces of Beattle-mania that are not included on this album because they were not number one hits. You can fault EMI for that if you want, but they had to draw the line somewhere, and when a band has enough #1's to fill a whole CD, that is probably a good demarcation point.In my mind, the first comment was more important than the second, enough for me to give it 4 stars. Buy it and enjoy!"
5,Clueless in Review Land,"This album makes modern release like Aerosmith's ""Just Push Play"" sound like ametuer productions. To reviewers giving this title a 1-star rating. Cummon, do you have a clue? Better yet, attempt to make music that sounds like this yourself. Doers like the Beatles always have to put up with armchair musician types who wouldn't know a guitar pick from a plectar in the ground. THIS ALBUM IS WAS AND WILL FOREVER BE, great."
5,"Fabulous, obviously.","Even though I probably have most of the singles on this album, I couldn't help but buy it. It's the BEATLES, folks. However, I was really upset to see so many really classic Lennon songs left out. Strawberry Fields, Revolutions, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds...I know it was just the number one singles, but... Anyway. It's amazing to me that a band that has been broken up for so long can still sell millions and millions of CDs within the first week. Unreal...."
5,"BRILLIANT,BRILLIANT,BRILLIANT,BRILLIANT,BRILLIANT","I LOVE THE BEATLES WHO ARE THE GREATEST BAND EVER.THEY ARE AS GOOD AS LED ZEPPELIN,THE STONES AND PINK FLOYD.ONLY AN IDIOT CAN HATE THEM.THEY MADE SEVERAL BRILLIANT MASTERPIECES WHICH ARE REPRESENTED BY 27 OF THE GREATEST SONGS EVER MADE.IGNORE THE BELOW MORONIC ONE STAR REVIEWER(THE EXTRAORDINARY GIRL A.K.A WHIRLIGIG) AND BUY IT TODAY.AVOID ALBUMS FROM MASSIVELY OVERRATED TR@#H LIKE FOREIGNER AND DIRE SRAITS."
4,Top Feeding,"This was a wonderful collection of many of the songs that I grew up with and wistfully placed on a higher plane of music than a lot of the tripe released todayI realize it was an authorized collection of Number One hits, but this collection didn't always explore the depths and reach of the Beatles material.Somehwere out there the has to be a collection of the songs that actually made many differences in my life (granted, that doesn;t mean that most people would have the same personal ""hit list"".All in all, this was a wonderful collection, and I would purchase it again (It might turn out to be a great tool for informing my 17 year old daughter about the group that actually opened rock and roll to broader dimensions--without me just jabbering to her about it).On a scale of 1-10, I would give it an 8.5"
1,come on seriously,"The beatles are highly overrated. Yes they did help influence many people who went on to make better music like Ozzy Osbourne, and yes they made rock and roll more popular and brought it mainstream. They changed a whole generation and it's music and for that I thank them and I also understand their importance in music history now with that said these songs are bad. They are very annoying and not because they are 60's pop music. I have heard much more of their song that were okay and only about 2 of these songs are worth listening to. So I'm guessing that even beatle fans wouldn't like this cd that much so if you do like the beatles then check out another best of of theirs or something."
1,Why do people like this so much?,"I can't stand the Beatles.....why do people like them so much? The earlier stuff is really boring, especially Love me do. I've been listening to the Beatles for about a month and man how hardthey sucked. The 60's was a really bad decade of music. They justdon't make any guitar solos period. The Beatles don't make goodmusic, period. And this is one of the most dissapointing greatesthits albums I have ever heard plus these guys only made like 7good songs. The best song on this is probably Hey Jude, and itis one of my top and favorite songs I have ever heard. Also, TheBallad of John and Yoko rocks!!!! A sad song about The Long andWinding road.....ehhhhhhhhhhh!!!!! Stay away from this crap, Green Day American Idiot is much better because it rocks reallyhard. Get that insted and ignore the 5 star reviewers of thisalbum."
1,"BEATLES SUCK,DIRESTRAITS IS GOD",What can I say about Dire Straits? They were the greatest bandin history and they sure rock pretty hard. To the Beatles...thiscompilation ooh man sucks! I have heard each and every song onthis and the music's plain bad and BORING!! Even Heavy Fuel DireStraits is much better than any of these boring songs..WHAT DOYOU SAY!!!! YEE HAW!! I see this in every store in the world andit plain sucks. Don't ever buy this album. It plain sucks!!PS: THE BEATLES ARE THE WORST BAND IN MUSIC HISTORY.VOTE YES FOR ME PLEASE!!!!ENTER SANDMAN FROM METALLICA.
2,Overrated Crap,"Why everybody loves these people, I can't understand. Most of the songs sounds the same. If you are looking for good examples of British Invasion era music, try the animals. They were way better. I gave this album 2 stars just out of respect for the fact that they revolutioniszed music. By the way I'm 13.TAKE ME SERIOUSLY!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,An apt title.,"I understand why the Beatles are the top sellers in rock music as they suck. They only made about two decent songs in their ""Hey Jude"" a pretty song, and ""Ballad Of John And Yoko"". The sixties was a horrible decade of rock music. I would have to be said that only very few good songs came out in the sixties, which one of them is Neil Young's ""Down By The River"".I have listened to the Beatles for about a month and thought how lame and pathetic their music was. They were hugely one of the most overrated bands of all time. This ONE album is definately not the album to buy at ALL unless you are a sick moron who does not have a good taste in music.Here you will get 25 of the worst songs ever recorded. If you want good music, I recommend go buy albums from Foreigner, Dire Straits, Green Day, Guns N' Roses, and Metallica insted. Don't buy this album at most costs as you will waste money on 25 awful songs."
5,Beatiful sounds,"What more can u ask for from the beatles, but all their number ones. Unless you're like me and find treasures on the b-sides. Excellent grooves to get birds movin to."
1,OOF,"The problem with ""authorized"" re-releases is that the ears that first mixed the songs are obviously no longer very good. The CD mastering for this disk is terrible. Period. Ditch that CD player, buy a decent turntable and phono preamp. Go browse the used record stores and pick up some ok copies of the originals. Ah, now that's the way it's supposed to sound. This CD does not do justice to the music or the performers."
2,true beatles fans will not like this CD,"I quite enjoyed a number of songs on this CD, and it may be a good place to start, but trust me, its a total waste of money. Many mediocre at best songs were on the album just because they were their most famous song, and some of their greatest songs such as a day in the life and Strawberry fields are not on this CD. Id reccomend pretty much any beatles album over this one."
3,Good Sampling of the Early Years,"Beatles 1 is a good sampling of the early years as it has lots of songs from the 1962-1965 period and none from Rubber Soul or Sgt. Pepper. From the Beatles later years, there a few good songs, including Get Back and Hey Jude. Generally OK."
2,A Terrible Abuse of a Terrific Opportunity,"As a die-hard beatles fan, I found this CD quite a letdown. I don't understand how such a great opportunity to rejuvenate beatles popularity was so horribly abused. Comprised mainly of the annoying teeny bopper poppy songs like ""I Want to Hold your Hand"" and ""We Can Work it Out"" that make up the [rear] end of their music, this album largely bypasses their excellent serious songs, and even the good songs on the CD are mostly upbeat, mindless, lighthearted songs like ""Yellow submarine"" and ""Penny Lane."" Let alone depth, there is not even a trace of the Beatles' trademark psychedelia in the entire CD. To anyone who is trying to get introduced in the enormously talented Beatles' music, I strongly urge you not to but this CD, but rather listen to albums such as ""Abbey Road,"" ""1967-1970,"" ""Revolver,"" and ""Let it Be."""
3,Show me the money!,"This is a product designed for the young and casual listeners, not the real fans. The Anthology and BBC releases were, but now its time to cash big time. So, they even omitted two of Lennon's number one hits that may sound 'uncommercial' for the teens and the working parents: Strawberry Fields Forever (weird-LSD imaginery) and Revolution (political contents). I understand all of that and I am a Beatles fan. But the one thing that is an insult is that the sound of those records has not been improved significantly. Listen to the Who records of the same time that have been reissued and then put on Beatles 1. Need I say more? Maybe the remastered and remixed versions are ready, but they will be released some time in the year 2020, when another 100 millions CDs of the current versions have been sold and the stupid Beatle fan has to buy all the albums all over again.."
2,$,"No ""White Album"" tracks at all. How can they leave out those awesome jams. It's OK, no one can appreciate the ""White Album"" by listening to single tracks anyway. They left out ""Here Comes The Sun"" as well..oh well, can't please everyone, so many songs but so little room on disc. All in all, a hideous compilation. A money machine."
1,Not nearly as good as it should have been ...,"I'm not sure what all the buzz about the word 'remastered' is ... other then sounds good to move product. This is the CD that changed my mind entirely about the word 'remastered.' It certainly lost something on many of the tracks. At times it is 'brittle ... harsh ... and even 'flat sounding' in the sense of the 'attacks' are almost completely washed out. There's no comparison between these 'remasters' and the ""Love"" CD that George and Giles Martin did. (George Martin also oversaw the remastering of the Yellow Submarine CD that came out a few years ago.) Personally, this CD was a big disappointment. Some like it - but I'd recommend you listen for yourself first. (They could have done much better - and should have.)"
3,a worthwhile purchase,"This is a great album for new fans of the Fab Four, but it doesn't get into who the Beatles really were, and almost completely ignores Lennon's influence on the group. It is impossible for this to be the only cd of theirs in a collection. A good compelation of songs, but needs a little bit more to be really excellent.Out of 10, I give this a 7."
4,The title says it all.,"As a remastered CD, 1 doesn't live up to the high standard set by the YELLOW SUBMARINE SONGTRACK, but what's here is as clean as has ever been heard, from original mono(Tracks 1-3)and stereo(everything else)mixdowns. The import 2-Lp vinyl is a more impressive package--the CD booklet graphics seem so minor by comparison--but there are plenty of international 45 sleeve/label reproductions, brief liner notes by producer George Martin, and most of all, great music. Unlike the 2-CD sets of 1962-1966 and 1967-1970, this is also good value for your money. Convenient that 27 #1 US/UK hits just about fills up the alotted CD space, but that's what we want, isn't it?"
4,Good CD,"This is a good compilation. I for one hate compilations because they take parts of different pieces of art to make a bad collage. ""No. 1's"" is good for the fans that like the Beatles hits and don't really like the rest of their songs. For the die hard fans this would be good for the car or cleaning music, but not as an enjoyable relaxation tool. For that I would suggest real albums, mainly the later work they did. This is still a great addition to any music library. It is also a great introduction tool to introduce young people to the greatest rock n' roll band of all time. I give ""No. 1's"" four stars because nothing beats a real album."
4,4.5 stars,"I give The Beatles # 1, 4 and a half stars. It's a good collection but I think it's missing a bit of songs. I wish they had put on George Harrison's 'Here Comes The Sun' or 'Revolution'."
5,Beatles 1,"I am not a big fan to all these early songs. But I do like some of the songs the Beatles have done which are some of the finest songs I have ever heard like HEY JUDE, DAY TRIPPER, and BALLAD OF JOHN AND YOKO. This would present everyone's collection so buy it."
3,I enjoy ..but would not purchase based on the audio review,Previous reviewer said that the quality of the EMI recording was poor.
5,A great start for new Beatles fans,"No, I'm not gonna buy other cds of the band, this cd is enough for a moderate fan like me! It has the #1 songs in the charts, for the first time, and it's a good starting point for new Beatles fans that want to listen some of the best.My fave tracks? Difficult to say--I listen to all of them as a whole, almost without noticing some are better than others. Maybe ""From me to you"" or ""She Loves You"" for its imaginative way of singing with the music, or the precious ""Hard Day's Night"". The sad ones are also welcome like ""Yesterday"", ""Hey Jude"" or ""Let it Be"". ""Eleanor Rigby"" is a great and different song. By the way, it's impossible not to be moved with ""The long and winding road"" as the last track, a perfect farewell to the best rock band ever.I'm a jazz and soundtrack fan, I don't care very much for rock, yet this album is a must for those who like 60's music a bit. Buy it, now!"
4,Reply to music fan in Detroit,"I LOL when I read your comments. Some people in the world may have not heard of the Fab 4. While I was in college, I worked at a summer camp. I had the teen cabin, girls from the age of just 13-17. They were discussing great music (as THEY knew it). They were currently ""NUTS"" about the Little Mermaid soundtrack. All is relative to your exposure and experience in life. Imagine my shock when they discussed the best song Elton John ever wrote and recorded, Lucy in The Sky with Diamonds! I almost feel out of my bunk from laughter! They looked at me....quite confused. ""What's so funny""? I had to convince them, for the next 1/2 hour that the song was not his originally. It was first recorded by J,P,G, & R. So give barefoot a break! Thanks for the chuckle. By the way, the CD is great! I miss the best cuts from Sgt. Peppers too as another reviewer commented."
3,Skip this and get their individual albums instead,"I'm a relative newcomer to the world of The Beatles myself, and logically decided to start off with a compilation of their hit singles. While 1 is a fair overview of songs in which the band found the most commercial success (and hey, how can you beat a 27 song CD for value?), most songs (particularly those from their earlier era) held little appeal to me. It wasn't until I heard the brilliant Abbey Road in its entirety, that I was convinced of The Beatles' genius. Like in many other cases, it's in the individual albums that you find the real gems. I'd recommend starting with that release, and then moving on to the equally essential, Sgt. Pepper's."
5,WHO CAN TOP THIS?,"THIS COLLECTION OF GREAT SONGS IS WHAT MUSIC IS ALL ABOUT.40 YEARS LATER AND THEY ARE STILL #1.COMPARED TO WHAT IS OUT THERE IN TODAY'S DUMB MUSIC,A CD LIKE THIS PUTS EVERYTHING TO SHAME. EVERY SONG IS A WINNER AND THEIR MUSIC CONTINUES TO LIVE ON."
5,Interesting Compilation,"Listen to all the other hardcore Beatle fans here and explore their studio albums. If there is any band out there to take a ""musical journey"" with its the Beatles. Its tempting to get a hits collection like this one and dismiss their studio albums. But you'll miss out on a musical group that produced brilliant albums without fillers. A Hard Days Night, Rubber Soul, Revolver, ""White Album"", and Abbey Road are some of most consistent albums aside from Led Zeppelin's work. This is still a must have though 'cause many of these singles were never included in their studio albums. Remember 45rpm singles? Man, I still get misty eyed whenever I hear the Beatles. No other music group has their Magic."
1,JUST DOESNT DO IT FOR ME,"I dont know what the huge deal is over the Beatles . The music is very yawnsome and they werent great singers.Comparing their composing to the likes of Mozart or Beethoven is absolutely laughable!!!.Their singing comes nowhere close to people like Elvis Presley , Stevie Wonder ,Aretha Franklin or Tom jones .All these singers had a soulful quality to their voices that transcended the listener to musical bliss. The Beatles just dont do it for me in this regard. Sorry.This cd is overrated ."
2,Commercial Beatles suck,"What I have realized since I started listening to the Beatles albums, is their commercial single releases suck for the most part. Add to that EMI'S Monetary greed. to keep rehasing the same old songs time and time again. And you have a very unappealing album. The best Beatles songs were never single hits.IN MY LIFETAXMANAND YOUR BIRD CAN SINGTOMMOROW NEVER KNOWSGETTING BETTERA DAY IN THE LIFEDEAR PRUDENCEHELTER SKELTERGLASS ONIONBIRTHDAYSOMETHINGCOME TOGETHERThose 12 songs are real Beatles classics. Only a few on ones are worthy. like Paperback Writer & Eleanor Rigby..."
3,Beatles 1,Pretty good if you listen to tracks 1 - 14 and just start over. Songs like Come Together and the Ballad of John and Yoko shouldn't even be on a best of the Beatles album.
2,Yuch!,"I like the Beatles, but theres no denying they had a lot of fluff. It was simple, empty pop songs that got them into a position where they had the power to experiment and innovate (for such a large audience, anyway).This hits compilation tracks mostly just the fluff, and it gets redundant before the CD is about half completed."
1,"Complete Disappointment, Total Disservice to the Music","Although this CD release had a huge publicity push behind it, it is a completely disappointing - no, make that a completely infuriating - regurgitory thrashing of some of the world's greatest pop singles. Some mastering engineer should be hung by his ear hairs for the absolute mid-range brash [music] he turned these tracks into. I want my money back on this one! I'll tell you what, I borrowed a Mexican bootleg Beatles collection from a friend, which he bought down there for two pesos, and the thing beats this over-hyped red-covered [cd] all to heck and back. Don't waste your money on this, you won't be getting the Beatles' magic outta this."
5,Excellent!,I love this CD! While I recommend buying all the other Beatles albums this is a great compilation of some of their greatest singles! Anyone who is not too familiar with their music should get this cd to start them off. It's great for newcomers and hardcore Beatles fans alike!
5,No Point In Arguing,"The Beatles weren't perfect, but they're as close as we've come so far. These songs are utterly timeless. 100 years from now, the vernacular of this music will still be familiar to millions. The same people who find flaws in this collection or in its repackaging are those who look for flaws in everything so that they may feel better about their own shortcomings. Don't be fooled. Buy this CD for a child who has yet to discover the band and see how ""tired"" the music sounds to them."
3,No. 1 Singles on CD? But not on original mono version!,"Yes, a dozen of songs are not on original ""MONO"" version! I got all the previous release CD of ""MONO"" version. The record company would need more money for issue this CD album. This is a record for young lovers !I hope the record company should re-issue the CD version of ""Rock and Roll"" and ""Love Songs""."
5,The Beatles 1,"This is a trip down memory lane to a slower and fun time,and it takes me to places I wish never would have ended. So I play this when I need a lift in spirit and just to get away from all that is going on now."
5,Like the Beatles? Then it's an easy decision!,"I am by no means an expert on the Beatles and I can't even place myself in a respectable ""fan"" category. Bottom line: I like the Beatles music, so I bought this greatest hits CD.If you like, love, would die for (well, maybe this is going to far), the Beatles...then you obviously don't have to think about it any further. :-)If your wondering if it's worth it, of course it is! You cannot go wrong with the Beatles. It's really that simple."
3,A Tad Unnecessary?,"I can't believe the hype that surrounded this release ... it is just another repackaging of the Beatles best-known songs. Yes, it has a special 'theme', in that they are not only popular, but just the #1 hits they had. But come on, there have been so many other Beatles compilations, some arranged more fittingly than ""1"", which is just a chronological rundown with no thought or flow to it.I'll give it credit for packing a LOT of music onto a single disc, though. But thats about it."
3,"No denying the Beatles, but this compilation is all wrong","This is the Beatles. They're the most influential pop and rock band of all time, so there's really no arguing with the music here. But rather than sticking to the all-number-ones concept, the surviving members got more of their own songs at the expense of John Lennon's actual number one singles. Please Please Me and Strawberry Fields, which are not included, were number-one singles. Eleanor Rigby and Something are great songs, but they were *not* number-one singles in the U.S. or the U.K., despite attempts to justify their inclusion. This slighting of John Lennon and his songs to boost Paul's ego gives this collection a nasty taste."
5,The Beatles 1,"This is the best of the best. Of all the Beatles CDs that I own and have heard, this is the best compilation of all. It is a great collection for the all types of Beatles fans. The avid Beatles fans will enjoy listening to the CD because it contains only the best from their favorite band, also because it is a collection of #1 hits, the not-so-avid Beatles fans will enjoy recognizing the best songs from one of the greatest bands in music history."
2,So-So CD,"This CD has all of the good songs, sure, but it's makes a whole lot of difference to hear them on the original albums, the way the beatles wanted them. Just warning you!!"
5,"The greatest ""1"" of them all !!!","The soundtrack of the sixties on one great cd - If you were there,you need this,and if you wern't,buy this and find out how great music was at one time!"
2,Inaccurate portrayal of the Beatles,"I am a huge beatles fan, but I do not like this album at all. If you really want to get into the beatles than buy Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band or The White Album. This cd only has a few of my favorite 20 Beatles songs. I understand that it is their number one hits compilation, but my advice is to look elsewhere if you want to buy a Beatles album, because this one does not do them justice."
5,The Perfect Album,"The Beatles' ""1"" is the greatest collection of rock and roll tracks ever recorded, period. The track list tells all."
5,Only disappointment is the last song...,"Don't get me wrong. I LOVE ""The Long and Winding Road."" However, the version most people know is this heavily-orchestrated Phil Spector ""wall of sound"" mess that the song turned out to be on the finished ""Let it Be"" album. But the best and most moving version is in the film ""Let it Be"" (as dismal as the film is, it's worth seeing only for that song!) There's no orchestra or heavenly choirs, just Paul on piano with a bit of accompaniment. It's almost a spiritual experience, it's so beautiful. Paul was supposedly outraged when he heard the ""final"" version, and I can see why. Hopefully the REAL version of the song will be released someday so all fans can hear how it was meant to sound."
5,Best CD Ever,"The Beatles are the greatest artists of all time. And what better way to show this by taking all of their number one hits and cramming them into one great CD! All of the 27 tracks are classic songs that no one should be without. The Beatles' best, all on one CD. Who could ask for more? (I know I can't.) So if you're thinking of buying this album, DO NOT HESITATE! It's worth the price. It's a must-have for every music collection."
1,where is the fifth Beatle?,"for the last two years of the Beatles, they were a quintet. John, Paul, George, Ringo and Yoko. Give her respect. I'd love to see Paul, Ringo and Yoko jamming together, imagine them singing Beatle songs with Yoko in John's place? doesn't that sound awesome?"
1,all the Beatles were good for was launching Yoko,"Beatle this, Beatle that, blah blah blahBuy a Yoko cd and forget this overrated tripe. Her career has been more fruitful and she's sold more records and lasted longer than the Beatles.The Beatles had one good song, Ballad Of John And Yoko, no more, no less. The Beatles would be a forgotten 60's band like Herman's Hermits and Dave Clark Five if it wasn't for the star power of Yoko to make them superstars in the late 60's.Skip this, and buy Yoko's Walking On Thin Ice cd instead. This is the most overrated music in history."
1,Old Music?I prefer classic music...,"I don't like beatles music.Its belong to another time...world have been change,...there's another values...I'm sorry but i think that this is only a repetition ....They represents ,maybe,a past...but in my opinion this is only another way to make money using old publicity... I belong to a generation that beatles are not a symbol. I'm sorry but is always the same old songs."
1,Garbage dated songs,"Why are the beatles considered the best group of all time? Is this some kind of joke? Songs like ""Love me do"" and ""from Me to you"" Really make you wonder why are these guys famous? The beatles are like the Backstreet boys. Dont buy this garbage."
1,Nothing to get excited about,"This music is just to old, you can't constantly like songs 30 years after they were made. If you really liked the Beatles back in the 60's and 70's then you might appreciate this and still not like it. The music was average back then, but still doesn't have a good sound that people can catch onto today. So, the Beatles just don't have what it takes to have timeless music."
2,Way overated,The most important thing that the beatles did was to water down and put an acceptable face on the black music that they had been listening to all of their lives. Just ask them who their musical heroes were and are. Now that's not to say that they haven't written some great songs mind you but by and large their music lacks intensity or rhythmic complexity or the purity that their r&b predecessors exhibited.
2,Not the Best,"The Beatles are by far the best band known to man, but this CD does not have the best music by the Beatles. In fact, it gives me a head ache. Now don't get me wrong, they're good songs, and i highly recommend it if you're just starting to listen to the Beatles, but if you're looking for the best Beatles music, buy The White Album."
1,The Omissions were the Real # 1's,"The conceit of this compilation is that #1 status can be decided by sales charts alone without any regard as to what stands the test of time as favorites among fans. In this album, second-rate Beatles tunes abound which, in their day, rose to #1 mainly because we were to stupid to care, as long as it was the Beatles. The better songs went over the heads of the fans at the time and had no chance to outstrip the more radio-friendly, accessible lollipops. The Beatles were arguably the only band successfully to straddle the worlds of bubblegum and progressive rock, largely due to McCartney and Lennon embodying these polarities respectively in their musical statements.There is no doubt that the Beatles were the most successful bubblegum act of all time; less known is that they were also the foremost pioneers of progressive music. This album celebrates their most trivial achievements to such an extent as to bury anew their most formidable contributions to rock."
1,Overall a disappointing compilation,"To be quite frank, the Beatles were always a better album band than they were a singles band. Despite racking up an impressive string of number one hits, the brilliance of this band would not be realized until 1966 with the release of the ""Revolver"" album. That said, the first half of this disc is dispensible, covering a period when the Beatles were catering to the teenyboppers with cookie cutter pop tunes the likes of ""She Loves You"", ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand"" and ""Can't Buy Me Love"". Songs like ""A Hard Day's Night"", ""Ticket To Ride"" and ""Help"" were standard soundtrack filler and are mediocre when compared to their late sixties output. The album suffers immeasurably from the absence of any songs from Sgt. Pepper or the White Album and a scant two tracks from Abbey Road. The Beatles have never been served well by compilations and this album is no exception. Buy Abbey Road or Sgt. Pepper first for a more satisfying introduction to the band."
4,Missing John's Best Song,"How can you have a greatest hits album without ""Strawberry Fields Forever""? This song changed the Beatles', and the sixties', musical direction. Both sides of the ""Something/Come Together"" single are included while only ""Something"" actually made it to number one. Leave off ""Penny Lane"" if need be, but this collection feels incomplete without SFF.That being said (I feel better now), the remastering improves the sound quality greatly over the original recordings. ""Let It Be"" and ""The Long And Winding Road"" are the two songs which benefit the greatest; Phil Spector's orchestration is pushed back in the mix and Paul's vocals are given much needed prominence. The CD booklet is great, showing various 45 sleeves from around the world. Any new addition to the Beatle catalog is welcome; I just ask for a little more thought in the song selection."
5,"The songs are 5 stars, but the message is lost.","A collection of The Beatles no. 1 hits is not a terrible idea by itself, but No.1's never mean their greatest songs.No Day In the Life - Rocky Racoon - Sexy Sadie - Lucy In The Sky - In My Life - You've Got To hide you love away -These Are their no. 1's to me but, this is aimed at casual fans (is there such a thing). After all, every piece of music we listen to today has been influenced by The Beatles. This won't be in my collection but if it converts the casual listner to a die hard, then hey, I'm all for it."
5,Best Greatest Hits Album !,"This album is awesome! Every track is great. This is a must have for any music lover. Anyone who can even compare the Beatles to the Backstreet Boys needs to have their hearing checked.... The Beatles wrote their own songs, played their own instruments, and impeccably produced songs at a time when the sound recording equipment and capability was 1/100th of a percent of what it is today. ""Penny Lane"" vs. ""I Want it That Way?"" It's not even a contest. In 30 years, I doubt anyone will remember the Backstreet Boys. The Beatles are timeless, just like Beethoven, Bach and Mozart. This album is excellent, and I would recommend it to anyone who is a collector of great music."
5,Great intro to a great band!,"I bought this cd for my girlfriend who knew nothing of The Beatles before we started dating. Now 3 weeks later this cd has not left her player once! I agree that for the established Beatles fan this cd is not an essential purchase, but for the people who are new to the band it is a great cross-section of songs spanning their whole career. Thanks to this cd, hopefully many more people will be introduced to these great songs and will in turn dig deaper and get the whole catalogue."
3,Hardly the best compilation,"I know this album is supposed to be about 'no.1 chart toppers' but a casual listener listening to this CD would have hardly understood the Beatles. The majority of the songs are from the period 63-65. Where are such classics as 'If I Fell', 'Nowhere Man', 'Michelle', 'Strawberry Fields', 'Across The Universe', 'Norweigen Wood'.etc.etc I know its impossible to make a Beatles 'greatest hits' CD, but a double or even triple CD with all their major hits would be a better bet."
3,I love The Beatles!!!!,"This was the first Beatles album I ever got. Before I was like, ""The Beatles? Who are they?"" Don't think this is actually a Beatles album! It's just a collection of #1s, a lot of them being Paul songs. You must get other Beatles albums. Otherwise you will get a not-so-great impression of The Beatles after awhile. Think if they had put ""Tomorrow Never Knows"" or ""I Am The Walrus"" on this album!!!!"
3,Beatles 1,"This is a pretty good collection of Beatles songs for several reasons. About half the songs are from the early years, in which the Beatles recorded their best music. Fortunately, there are relatively few songs from the Beatles middle years, as there are no songs from either Rubber Soul or Sgt. Pepper, and only two from Revolver. The last half of the CD is OK, but hurt by tracks like the Ballad of John & Yoko. Generally worth the price, even if you only play the first 14-15 songs. 3-stars."
4,Good intro to the Beatles,"If you are a Fab Four neophyte, you should get a hold of this collection of ""number 1"" singles. This by no means showcases the Beatles best work. It's just a glimpse of it. I don't know why they excluded ""Strawberry fields"", ""Day in a life"" or ""In my life."" But what you've got here is some gems."
5,"The Pop Standard for, uh, Forever?","Herein lie the Beatle's number one chart toppers from the band's debut to disintegration. It pretty much stands as a yardstick by which all of the pop music for the past 40 years can be measured, with no end in sight. The Beatles' profound ability to make fun, purely enjoyable music is best represented by this collection.It's not a deep exploration of the Beatles' abilities and vision, but it's a great collection of fun, fun, fun songs to listen to and sing along with. The Beatles' simple songs are packed with incredible rhythm, lyrics, and great instrument playing. Overall, definitely a good purchase, though if you just collect all the Beatle's albums and rip the number ones off them and compile them on one disk you'd get the same effect..."
5,It's About Time,"""1"", being the definitive Beatles ""best-of"" compilation, is a pure masterpiece for the rock 'n roll genre and beyond. This album is thorough, featuring all of their #1 hits during their existence, and it is proof alone that The Beatles are the greatest rock outfit of all time. Sure, there's nothing overtly spectacular about their musicianship skills, but they conquered the throne first. Presenting their material flawlessly, upholding dominant melodic layering, ""1"" is a must-own compact disc!"
1,disgraceful,"Since Mr. Holycross's review is perfect. I am only writing to corroborate his view. It has been 20 years since decent versions of this material have been commercially available. A generation. The vast majority of people who read Mr. Holycross's review no doubt think he is some sort of quack. I assure you everything he says is exactly true. If you can dig up a copy of a 60's British pressing of any of their l.p.s, you will be shocked and outraged at how this material has been ruined and mispresented. It has nothing to do with cd technology, a thousand good (and dozens of great)60's reissues have long since proven this. This is completely the fault of stupid lazy people at parlophone. If it was possible to give 0 stars I would. disgraceful!"
1,Geezer music,"My grandma owns this CD.Just think about it for a second.She's 82.Shouldn't that be enough of a reason not to listen to The Beatles? People who experienced """"Beatlemania"""" are probably living in retirement homes by now. Unless you were brainwashed by your parents that this is ""real music"", there is simply no logical reason to buy this album. Why do people choose to live in the past, while wonderful pop music is being created today? Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Rihanna, Mika and Bruno Mars are creating groundbreaking music as we speak. Get with the times. Lyrics like ""she loves you yeah yeah yeah"" and ""all you need is love love yeah love is all you need"" are mindless and something that would be heard on television shows for children.. check out Bruno Mars' ""Just The Way You Are"" for lyrics that are truly empowering, something that John Lennon himself would be envious of."
2,"Great band, but Backstreet Boys are better.","No doubt about it the Beatles were one of the greatest pop bands to exist, but its time to acknowledge the genius of another pop group who threatens to eclipse the melodies and talent of the Fab Four. That band is Backstreet Boys. Can ""Penny Lane"" come close to ""I Want it That Way""? Nope. C'mon people. This collection shows just how fantastic the Beatles songwriting abilities were, but it's the 21st century now, it is time to hail the new gods of pop."
3,AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH,"I love The Beatles but this is not the beatles good stuff,there good stuff that was never massively popularcase in point: Rocky Racoon, one of the best beatles songs ever but was never a hit.There is nothing from the White Album or Sgt Peppers the two most influential rock albums ever.This is the equivalent of a Jimi Hendrix Album without anything from ""Are You Experienced""A best of has to be at least 4 albums long to make senseARRRRRGHHHHJust go buy 4 Cd's: Sgt Peppers, The White Album, Revolver, and Abbey Road.(some may dissagree but I think this is the best and least flawed beatles album)"
2,I miss a couple of songs,"Where is Girl?Where is Drive My Car?Where is Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds?Where is Birthday?And the line is endless.....I think this is a weak compilation from such a great band, if U want 2 hear their best get Abbey Road, St.Pepper's, The White Album and Let It Be. This No.1 CD is not a No.1, it is just a bunch of old songs, but not their best."
4,review from a 15 year old,"I have been listening to the beatles all my life,my dad got me into them,so i got the beatles 1,and its not a bad cd really,but if you really want to have the ultimate beatles experience,then i would suggest getting the original cd,s,i only own beatles 1,and abbey road,and l love them both,but i was dissapointed,that there were no sgt pepper songs,but it surely beats those annoying rap songs,whatever a rap artist accomplishes all his life the beatles accomplished it with only a album,and this one is it."
2,Disappointed,"I bought these shoes to do aerobics in. They look good and are comfortable, but only to walk in. There is zero arch support and when I walk in them I feel as if my feet are flat on the ground. There is zero shock absorption and no cushion for doing aerobics. My old shoes that are 8 months old has triple the cusion of these new ones, but I can't use the old ones. The gym on the base here do not allow dirty shoes. They are 8 months dirty full of sand and dirt. I am really let down over this as it took me three weeks to have them delivered to my remote location. Now I have to look again."
2,"Poor quality remaster, but some of the music is nice.","What more can I say? I've got much older music in my collection where the remastering job is excellent. I don't know what they had to work with on this collection, but the sound is flat and, IMO, mediocre at best. Regarding the selection of music; I think they could have left off many of the weaker songs, which to me are embarrassingly bad (i.e. She Is Still A Mystery) and have not withstood the 'test of time'. Of the 26 songs on the CD, I will listen to only 8 at most and set up my music server so the others don't get played. While I might have grown up with this music, I evidently have outgrown it. YMMV"
3,Look for a bettern collection!,"This collection was ok, but it seemed they were just trying to fill a cd. I would not say that it was a ""greatest hits""."
5,Oldies but still worth listening to.,"I kept humming a song I rarely hear on the radio--like so many that been played to death. So I decided it would be worth buying this cd. It still sounds very good, and it's a bit of nostalgia for me."
4,Half a teaspoon of Full Lovin',"Lovin' Spoonful deserves a full Box set of all recorded LPs.Any single CD complilation skips favorites and shakes out hits like a turned-over salt/pepper combo on a buffet platter.John Sebastian wrote classic songs, was as important to his time asIrving Berlin or Cole Porter to their era.The humor, the rhyme, the ache of the times!"
5,Biggest and Best Mouthful of the Lovin Spoonful,"I had a couple of inexpensive cd's of the Loving Spoonful and what a waste of money. The mastering was horrible like someone had an old album recorded it onto a cassette and then transferred it to a cd. Well after Buddha Records decided to release the original masters and put them on cd it was like seeing the sun for the first time after about a week of rain.The music is good stuff and the sound is crisp and clear like never before. One song that you never seem to hear on the radio anymore is here-(Didn't Want to Have to Do it) and a very clean recording. Also, the song (You Baby) is great and I believe that John Sebastian is not singing lead on this song. Evidently all of the members could sing and sing well. THIS IS THE ONLY CD TO BUY, no disappointment here."
5,Lovin Spoonful,"I think it is really good. My favorite songs are ""Summer In the City"" and ""Money."" I also think it sounds really good."
2,Not the Same as Original Hits,"I was really looking forward to having this - but some songs are reworked and not the same songs as heard on the radio. Especially mournful to me is the song ""Younger Girl"" - it is NOTHING like the hit song on the radio - on this CD it is done by one guy with one guitar. I remember the song with all the guys, harmonies and more instruments. I wish I could send this back in and get my money back - I am that disillusioned."
1,DRM damaged by Design,"Do not buy this disk. It is NOT a CD, it does not meet the standards for audio CDs and th CD icon is notably absent on the cover. The DRM used causes skipping making the music unlistenable.Amazon should pull this disk from its inventory"
5,Incredible collection of great songs,"I think John Sebastian is one of the most original, authentic and talented American artists alive today. I had forgotten how many songs from this collection I knew, and some of them I didn't even know were Lovin' Spoonful songs. There's something so unpretentious and heartfelt about this music, particularly gems like Six O'Clock and Nashville Cats."
5,love the lovin spoonful !!,John Sebastian and the Lovin Spoonful have always been one of my favorites. Their music is positive and happy...a sign of the times we were in then. This cd is great.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!,"DO NOT BUY THIS CD - It contains songs from Dolly before she became famous, songs that she doesn't have the rights to - these songs and the quality are awful.... so much so that they have been available free in Sunday newspaper give aways!I LOVE DOLLY and everything she does - but these recordings do not even sound like her they are so bad and they are available on lots of other albums. You will NEVER find them on any album Dolly releases herself."
3,it was ok,"the shippment was really slow and there were such a lot of stickers on it so it look bad, but it was ok for the used book. i studied well with this book."
4,A pleasure to read,"Maugham once said of himself that he was in ""the first row of second tier"" of writers ... but this book leaves novels by ""first tier"" writers in the dust. Wonderfully written, great paragraphs, insights into the human condition, and a story line and builds and builds. You really identify with the characters by the end and feel their emotions as they feel them. I loved it. Maugham did, too -he said it in the intro to my edition that it was his favorite novel."
4,Maughum does not disappoint,"I find Maughum's work a refreshing adventure into a by-gone world of polite society and I try to incorporate a Maughum novel into my reading list every 3 or 4 books. His turns of phrase, colorful characters, and Old World sensibilities make for satisfying reading. This novel is no exception.."
4,"Good short novel, not his best","Told in the first person, this quasi-autobiographical novel is often amusing and insightful. Its main weakness, in my opinion, is that the character of Driffield, who plays a large part in the book, and is a thinly disguised Thomas Hardy, remains a puzzle throughout. I never got any hint as to what his motives or sentiments were. Of course, the first person narrator can't be omniscient, but the other characters in the book had a lot more flesh on their bones."
5,Fascinating - and funny!,"Further to the other excellent reviews here, I'd just like to add my two pennorth. I tried Maugham when in my twenties, but couldn't get into it at all. Now, 20 years on, I am just loving his writing, there is a quiet and subtle humour there that I'd almost completely missed the first time round. As well as painting a fascinating picture of the sheer stuffiness and rigidity of British class society from yesteryear, it's also just funny. I laughed out loud many times reading this book. It's a wonderful piece of writing."
5,Completely mundane and completely devastating,"This book reads like an autobiographical account of a young man coming of age whose live is intertwined with that of a literary couple. The narrator reflects on his long association with the Driffields, an author many suspected of being modeled after Thomas Hardy, and his wife. It's absorbing as it plods along, but at the center of it is a revelation so brilliant that it leaves the reader stunned (gobsmacked - UK). Reading Cakes and Ale is like peeling away the layers of an onion and finding a diamond inside."
3,CAKES & ALE,"I thought ""Of Human Bondage"" was a exceptional book. And ""Razor's Edge"" was excellent. But I was disappointed in ""Cakes & Ale"".To be fair it was a British satire and I am American. Also, it was written over 80 years ago. So maybe because of culture or time, I was not able to grasp all of the humor. But I just found the book somewhat boring."
4,Fascinating History,"This is not a novel, but a collection of historical facts and rumors that souuround the Borgia clan. A little sensationalistic and written with a moralizing tone, but a fascinating read. Dumas sometimes cites sources and other times does not so its not always easy to seperate facts from rumors from speculation. He certainly buys into the murder, poisionings, rapes, incest, and general licentiousness accusations that surrounded Pope Alwexander VI, Caesar and Lucretia. His listing of the Pope's illigitimate children and thier order of birth does not agree with more modern authors, but that's a minor point. This book has been used as a source for other writers on the Borgias. As I said, its a fascinating read and once you start, you can't put it down. Good introduction to how the Borgia clan got its sinister reputation."
2,literary translation is an art,I am not judging the content but the translation. The translation is extremely poor. It is full of typographical errors and has not been proofread. I notice that the name of the translator is not on the cover. I am not surprised. I would not wish mine to appear either if I were responsible for it. Literary translation is an art this is very pedestrian. I started to read the book but then decided to read it in the original and recycle this sorry effort.
4,Fast Read,Bought this book as vacation read. Finished this book quickly. Page turner and very interesting subject. Good read for upcoming Showtime series in 2011.
2,Dumas would be turning in his grave,"Typos is an understatement. This is without a doubt the most horribly edited/proofread book I have ever come across. How anyone could overlook this and give a good review is beyond me. Names are spelled in a variety of ways (the same names) throughout the entire book - extremely confusing - especially if the reader is unfamiliar or new to the Borgia and the times. Whoever translated it obviously thought all vowels were interchangeable. The subject matter is interesting, no arguement there, but there are much better books out there on the subject. I also thought the extraordinary amount of words spent counting soldiers, horses, blades could have been better spent illuminating the characters. This may be part of Dumas's style but I thought it was too repetitive and somewhat boring. Save your money or look for it by another publisher."
1,Reads like a history book not a novel,This book as very little about the Borgias and plenty about Charles VIII. Don't even waste your money buying it.
5,Awesome adventurous trance-inducing kraut-rock,"I have heard a LOT of kraut-rock in the past few years. Tons of Faust, Can, Amon Duul, Agitation Free, Ash Ra Temple, Neu, etc etc etc....and this album by a guy I'd never heard of stands up there at the very top of the pile.He's often compared to Tangerine Dream , but I have yet to hear a TD album that makes my soul smile like this first album by Deuter. This is a wonderfully entertaining exploration of drones, swells, rhythms, and melodies. Deuter was clearly a student of Indian ragas, but he took that influence and mixed it with drug-tinged psychedelia and synthesizers to create a vibrant new hybrid.If you're into kraut-rock, world music, ambient, and/or psychedelia, you need to get this album. Also highly recommended to fans of Acid Mothers Temple and the new psychedelia....."
2,Off the subject.,"It gives some partially effective forms of meditation and healing, but goes to deep on just one stone and is way to complicated and confusing for the beginner it is made out to be for. It gives long and hard ways to complete simple tasks."
3,A good introduction,"While not what I consider a ""classic text"" on the subject, this is a very comprehensive introduction to working with the quartz crystal. Its subtleties introduce fewer forms of quartz and other gems in order to focus moreso upon the application of them to our lives. I highly reccomend the book to those searching for an earlier work with a very ""New Agey"" flair. It leaves out much of the glitz and glamour of the books of the era, however it cannot escape it altogether.This book does build upon some great earlier works, and it promulgates some very good practices found therein."
2,"Good intention, disappointing result","This book could have been a gem for people interested in botany and healing plants, but it does not manage to fill this void. The text is not read by a professional botanist (I assume) and incorrect or dubious facts are common. Furthermore, the text is filled with typos and misspellings that could easily have been caught in a simple spell-checking program. The figures are from older literature and are not well reproduced. The aim with this book, to explain botany in a day, is highly recommendable, but I cannot recommend this book in its present shape and quality-level. A completely corrected, re-formatted, and revised edition of this book is needed. For people interested in the plant families of North America I instead recommend the high-quality work of Zomlefer: Guide to Flowering Plant Families."
5,A must have item to complete the set,"This is a very useful item and essential to complete the IGo charging system , you can charge your laptop, cell phone , mp3 player.I recommend this item to all IGo users."
3,Only works sometimes,"Splitter only works when you have specific devices plugged in. For example, I have a Zune, a Nokia e71 and a Motorola phone. If I charge the Zune and one of the phones, it works fine, but if I charge both my phones then my Nokia doesn't charge."
2,Not for everything,This does not charge all of the items it fits. But when it does work it is nice to have.
4,Handy gadget,What a great tool for charging your many small electronics. I have this splitter in every vehicle.
5,Fantastic accessory,iGo tips are already great and this splitter makes charging even easier and more convenient. We will not travel without it.
3,Only one side charges my iphone,"At first I thought this unit didn't work entirely with my iphone, but then when I took this splitter off I realized that was the problem. After a bit more finessing, I now know that only one side of this will charge the iphone, and the other will charge anything. Kind of strange but there it is."
3,Go-so,Second item of this brand I purchased. It will be useful but because the piece that adapts for the Ipad and Iphone does not work on the Ipad but will on the Iphone if the cover is removed it will be ok as a back-up on occasion but a pain to deal with regularly for me.
5,A quirky tale of cigars,This book has some far out ideas and stories about the origins of cigars. A little hard to follow but a funny read and a great addition to my bookshelf
3,"Good Songs, Great Singing...........BUT.....................","THIS DISC NEEDS TO BE REMASTERED! Being a longtime Randy Meisner fan, I bought this CD as soon as I saw it on the shelf. I've given it three stars based on the material and performances but the sound quality makes it difficult to listen to. The sound is ""muddy"" with no high end whatsoever. The result is muffled sounding vocals and no crispness to any of the instruments. This could have been a great disc. What a shame!"
4,An Intriguing Tale of the Macabre,"You haven't seen anything quite like this before. Highly recommended for those who like their horror tinged with a little bit of camp. A product of the seventies, Malatesta's Carnival of Blood mixes trippy art direction and camera work with a truly ghoulish storyline. An odd assortment of spooky characters, including one played by Herve de Villechaize (of Fantasy Island fame), inhabits an old carnival with some dark secrets. The cinematography, obscure lighting, and an intense soundtrack contribute to the hypnotic, edgy feel of the movie. This is a real cult classic, weird, spooky and entertaining. As a plus, this DVD edition is very nicely designed and packaged, and features some amusingly grisly outtakes."
1,"So bad, it's....bad","I'm also a fan of low-budget, and B-flick flops, but this baby just didn't do anything for me. I was intrigued with the whole concept; a lost 70's thriller with little Herv, and some reviews praising this like it's a jewel of a flick. The story is just too incoherant for me. I couldn't wait to pop it out of the player, and get it to my used dvd guy. Hey, I respect anyone who likes it, but unfortunately for me, I found this to be unwatchable."
2,Filmed On Location in My Hometown,"This low, low-budget film was shot on location at Willow Grove Park in the early 1970's. The park was once a grand amusement park just outside Philadelphia. During its heyday, the park was a thriving landmark and was the summer home of John Phillip Susa. By the time this movie was shot at the park, it was a moribund faade of its former glory. This just adds to the creepiness of the atmosphere of this film. I grew up in Willow Grove. The park was a large part of my childhood. I watched the film recognizing images of my feckless youth flicker by my eyes. If you grew up in the area and fondly remember Willow Grove Park, do your self a favor and seek out this film. It will give you a rush of memories. The park is now longer there. It is now a shopping mall that bears its name."
2,Proto- Rob Zombie (At Best),"Yeesh; I cannot believe I spent $20 on this DVD. When I initially read about MCOB, it sounded promising in a Something Weird Video kinda way; after all, I love myself some Blood Freak; The Sinful Dwarf; Satan's Children etc. With Herve Villechaize and thought to be lost for 30 years? Sign me up! But after watching it, I dunno why anybody particularly cares that it was lost. Doesn't make (much) sense, is lacking in plot, is lacking in gore (very important particularly if you've got the word BLOOD in the title no?!), Herve's in it for two minutes or something, has the very common 70s problem of bad lighting... Look people, not having a plot or a very poorly-organized one DOES NOT make a movie ""surreal"" or any other big college word like that. It just means it's not good, OK? The best I can say for this movie is that it has a very proto-House Of 1000 Corpses vibe to it and that Mr. Blood reminds me a bit of Bob Newhart and/ or Kelsey Grammar but that's about it."
5,Another sexy shoe,"Yep, this is another shoe that's just awesome. Good thing my feet are smaller than most of the women at my church, or they'd probably have 'begged' me out of this shoe by now. Awesome."
2,Wii sling bag review,"Maybe it's just me, but this product does not do what it's intended for. I can fit the console in the bag with one cord. Other than that, I have to carry around a completely separate bag with me for all the other Wii stuff (controllers, games, etc.) I would get the messenger style bag. At least that holds the system, the cords and a couple other accessories."
5,A CROCKPOT FULL OF HONEY AND DYNAMITE,"Crank it up and wipe that grin off your face. This album really cooks and Weider plays from the bottom of his heart. He is on his way up there with Hendrix, Vaughn and company."
4,not just any band,"after hearing Jim Weider's 1st solo cd, since The Band stopped recording,,i was a fan for life. His guitar stylings & Randy Ciarlante's rhythmic leadership make for a great great piece of music. Richard Bell, & all their other friends just add spice to some blistering original tunes,,,& a reworking of some friendly old friends,,, please, if you are a TELECASTER fan, jimmy is the BEST,, & the entire package is a must,,, Randy's vocals, harmonies & groove show he was ""paying attention ""when he sat next to & behind some of the best musicians ever,, Levon Helm & Rick Danko,,,But BIG FOOT is an ORIGINAL album,, get it, you'll see,,,,"
3,good collection,this is a split best of cd. it was a good pick up when it came out for me because the local record stores didnt have the mercyful fate cds in stock and listening to them on warped tapes was th eonly way for me to hear them. but in 2008 only a die hard who has to have everything will need this cd in their collection. but with a pretty solid song selection its a great listen.
3,More than enuff of the King,"This is all the King Diamond you really need, and more than you can probably tollerate. This stuff gets old fast and starts to give one a headache. He screams, sings so high only dogs can hear him, you cant understand most of the words, I've heard the lyrics are hokey about a lost jewlery or something haunted, but not scary because you cant understand the words. However, used it is worth $4.00 just to get No Presents fo Christmas. What an awsome song. Abigail gives me a headache."
3,i think that they really are cool and i love the guitar,i love the music i love the song evil i love the way you play the guitar and the way you sing i love the song man dude
5,"A divine read, a perfect book...","Totally captivating and one of a kind. Darkly charming, and very sophisticated. A kind of Haroun Al Rashid adventure of an entirely different sort of king... Highly recommended. You will not want it to end."
5,Remastered in HD,"I think one of the most interesting facts here is that they are remastering this season in HD. I'm not sure if that means widescreen or not, but for those of us with an HD TV this is pretty cool. I dont think I've seen any other TV show released in HD."
5,great!,"Ok finally this is the last season i was missing in order to complete the whole collection! i'm so happy i could geet them! you can't get them here in argentina, i've searched everywhere!!! but finally i can sit with my pop corns and enjoy the whole show! thank you"
4,great dvd but....,"my only problem is when i go to watch the collection some dvd won't play at all in my player? i tried diffrent players, xbox ect and it won't work... but over all the dvds are great.."
4,Probably the best season,"I think this is probably the show's best work. So many classic episodes. The actors were definitely comfortable with each other by now, but they were still fresh. I tend to think people who buy TV series on DVD start at season one and buy each one, so don't stop at three. If you don't buy in order (which isn't really necessary for Seinfeld because it has no plot), season four might be a good place to start."
5,"They're all such horrible, horrible people!","This is my favorite season. It has ""The Contest"", which was a bet sparked by George's mother catching him at ""you know...I was alone..."". They all bet on who can go the longest without doing ""you know..."". Although this is most people's favorite Seinfeld episode, mine happens to be ""The Junior Mint"", also in this season. Jerry is dating a woman whose name he can't remember but he knows it rhymes with a female body part. Could it be Mulva? And who can forget George's Trival Pursuit game with the Bubble Boy, in which the Bubble Boy loses by insisting the Moors conquered Spain in the 8th century, when in fact, it was the Moops.Although Seasons 1-3 were good, Season 4 is when the show became sidesplittingly funny. When we would go to work or school and everyone would be talking about the episodes. I can't wait for this video."
5,The Best Season of the Best Comedy Series,The Contest? The Outing? The Junior Mint? The Handicap Spot?'nuff said.
3,Pretty good season Im still waiting for the beltless trenchc,Im still waiting for the 2 part Beltless trenchcoat episode. Its the best episode but I dont know what season it was.
2,sienfield 4th season,"I seen previews for these Sienfield seasons, but what I seen on TV advertised isn't on any of these DVDs.Little let down."
2,Oy Gevald!,"Jerry my boy - Yenna veld, dreck like this won't be so revered. Its all just a mish mash of one megila after another. Seinfeld is obviously one farshtinkener of a knaker with a shmekel to put out such bopkis. The last time I saw one of these episodes I vlegoiled so hard I shvitzed my drawers and couldn't achkem for a week!"
2,Overrated to put it kindly,"I have tried time and time again to absorb the supposed humor of this show. It's always on reruns so I can't understand why anyone would dream of paying money for this set. Kind of a waste to pay for what you can get free. But back to the show, there are quite a few older, funnier shows like ""Kate and Allie"" that dealt when the same concepts. Sue me, I just have to resort to fake laughter (which I loathe) whenever I watch this with my boyfriend (who is a dreamboat)."
5,Seinfeld is the best show ever!,"I love Seinfeld....I just had to have it, I love it and that is all I can say it is the best show ever...I will be returning to Amazon to order the continuing releases of all the Seinfeld DVD's."
5,Amazing Value!,"PROS: SoftCuddlyGood SizeBrushableCONS: ""Sheds"" ALOT for first day or twoOVERALL REVIEW: In the end, it is a really good quality toy that I will have fun with for years to come."
3,Disappointing Allingham,"The best bit is the artistic milieu, especially the industrious Potters who live in a shed in the garden. Though lacking in talent, they are genuinely gripped by art. Mr Campion seems ghostly himself, drifting through, letting others talk and not cracking a single joke. And the lovely Lugg doesn't even get a mention. What was Margery up to?"
5,Great movie,"This is one of my favorite movies and I never get tired of watching it. I used to look forward to seeing it on tv, but now that I have my own copy, I can view it whenever I want. It has everything I enjoy in a movie: adventure, romance and interesting characters. I don't know why we don't see more of Mitzi Kapture or Anthony Natale because they were great as the two lead characters. Mitzi Kapture played Jenny Farrell, the head of security for a pharmaceutical company. Sam Rollston (Anthony Natale), chemist and son of the company's president was the only witness of the theft of a valuable new drug that resulted in a murder. Jenny was assigned to act as bodyguard for the only witness. You can guess that the bad guys would stop at nothing to kill Sam, so Jenny had to use all her skills to keep them both alive. While fighting for their lives, Jenny and Sam had time to fall in love! So suspenseful and satisfyingly romantic."
3,Hall of the Mountain king is Snyder's version of the tragedy,I enjoyed this book greatly since it details America's worst mountain tragedy and is written before the lead climber's rebuttal in White Winds by wilcox
1,canceled order,After accepting my order and payment for this book. The order was canceled...with no attempt to fill the order at a later date.
2,I love Popol Vuh but this one doesn't hold together,"I have been a fan of Popol Vuh for over 25 years and particularly think the Tantric Songs/Hosianna Mantra cd is completely incredible. I recently purchased this cd and couldn't find a single cut that I liked.It felt like sounds were pasted together instead of flowing, and that this was a low point in their career. Please listen to the samples carefully so that you make your own decision."
5,powerful and emotional interpretation,"this very minimalistic piece written by john cage in his earlier stage for merce cunningham's dance piece, here was interpreted by haydee schvatz so powerfully yet emotionally delicate. also jack bruce's interpretation of the unaccompanied song is exceptionally beautiful."
3,disappointing cos....,I really wanted to stay on the 80's track instead of anything earlier. ho hum.
5,Like One of Their CDs Says....,"...only Sisters can do that. You'd be hard pressed to find harmony like the way the Pointers do it, that chemistry, or for that matter, that clearness--even Ruthie's lower register in ""Automatic"", you understand evvy word. Not so a lotta singers. Their steelo is to mangle the language...What? We're talking about singers here. Not reviewers...It doesn't bother me one iota that ""Fire"" seems more country-rock than R & B: they're cuzzinz, anyhoo. Nor does it bother me that a lotta folks equate the Pointers with straight up disco: I was with them from the beginning, and I've seen them live a few times. They do all sorts of good music, period. It's a great disservice to these ladies to pigeon hole them...."
5,The Sisters Rock,"This is an excellent collection of the Pointer Sisters hits. The only thing missing is ""Yes We Can Can"" however, it is my understanding it was on a different label and could not be added to this CD. In my opinion this is the best ""Best of the Pointer Sisters"" available."
5,Forgot how great their music was,"After reading the reviews for Pointer Sisters compilations, I bought this one -- in time to take on a recent RV trip. Slogging up 101 from San Luis to Morgan Hill, the trip went much quicker listening to this album. Forgot all but about three of the cuts, and I enjoyed refreshing my memories of the Bay Area at that time. This is the album to buy. Thanks to the other reviewers for ""pointing"" me to this one."
4,Fun cd.,"This cd is really fun to listen to. There were a few songs I don't remember, but the rest were great. Also the shipping was fast."
2,Comes up short,"Here are the differences between the Nordic Pure I unpacked and the Honeywell model it replaces: (1) It is 7/8"" less thick; (2) It has several fewer pleats, meaning even less surface area; (3) It is .25"" smaller in length and breadth, making for a poor fit in the HVAC unit; (4) The filter is packed in a way that looks haphazard, which may be meaningless -- or perhaps not. Granted that it's only half the price, but I'm guessing it has >30% less filtration medium, and the poor fit does not bode well, and who knows about the quality of the medium? Henceforth I'm sticking with the name brands."
1,Mac Compatibility Issues,"Apparently this mouse has compatibility issues with the most current versions of Mac OS X. I'm using 10.4.3. The mouse is recognized and moves the cursor around the screen just fine, but when you click the cursor jumps to the top left corner of the screen. This is a consistent problem making it impossible to use. For PC, works fine. For mac, 0 stars."
2,Not for Macintosh,"I bought this mouse for my MacBook. The mouse cursor immediately jumps to the upper left side of the screen as soon as you click on the mouse. Move the mouse, click and back it jumps to the left top of screen. 100% unusable on the Macintosh. An insanely bad mouse for an insanely great computer.I moved the mouse over to my work PC (Dell). It works pretty well on that machine, but I've noticed that it is very jumpy, meaning the cursor moves in hops instead of a smooth roll.The only reason I gave it more than 1 star is due to the wonderful hardware design. You'll never lose the USB transmitter since it fits neatly inside of this mouse. Unfortunately due to its poor performance, you'll wish you could lose the whole thing."
2,"Great features, but fails as a mouse","This mouse is very compact, and the way that it stores its USB receiver internally means that it is easy to pack and avoid the situation where one part or the other gets lost.However, either I have a defective mouse or the optical tracker is the worst implementation I have ever seen. It fails to consistently recognize and track movement across most surfaces. Therefore I can't recommend this mouse."
3,A Great mini-mouse,"It looks like an excellent design. Works and feels small. Packs up easily. After a year, I find it's too small and lacks sensitivity. Nor really worth it. I use my standard Logitec mouse and that works fine."
2,"nice and small, wish it worked better...","after all the good reviews from the pc mags i thought this would be the mouse for me. Liked the way it stores the receiver away. But compared to the similar logitech ones, this mouse is just a little too small. Plus quite frequently when i popped the receiver out of the body, the mouse did not turn on, so i would have to store it and pop it out again.I wouldn't recommend buying this one."
1,Defective product,"The mouse only works for 1 months, then it stop working. You can see from Device Manager that the device disappears within a few min. after you plug in the USB transmitter.Call them and was told there is a known heating issue. Wait for 3 months, after pushing them again, they finally told me that the issue has been fixed. Sent me the replacement, only works for 2 x 15 min. and the same thing occurs.Don't buy this item."
3,Pad Thai,"The key to any Asian dish is the sauce. Buying Pad Thai in a box means you're buying the right noodles and an interesting sauce ready to go. The box includes lots of noodles for two people, but the sauce is not as generous for the amount of noodles, and it's not very interesting. You also have to add lots of other ingredients to make it resemble real Pad Thai, so it's not much of a time saver. Still lots of work along with a disappointing taste."
5,Delicious Quick and Easy,I love the sauce for this product. I was concerned about the comments of not being enough sauce for the noodles provided but did not find this to be an issue. Adding a bit of soy to the final prepartion stage helped. I made this with uncooked shrimp and it was delicous. You do need to be prepared to have on hand what other ingredients you wish to add (including peants) - the box only has noodles and sauce. I plan to try it with tofu as well.The first time I made this dish I followed the directions and used hot tap water on the noodles and the second time I used some recently boiled water. The boilded water made the noodles stick together and I had a hard time getting them to separate. When I used the hot tap water I did not have this problem. I suggest placing them in the water a bit at a time so the potential sticking won't happen.Plenty of food for two! I will definately buy this again.
4,"Delicious, quick and easy meal","This is by far the best Pad Thai I have tried so far, and I have tasted many boxed preparations. I have added shrimp, occasionally chicken but quite frankly, it's good as is. I sometimes add slivered sweet red pepper for color and, of course, cilantro and lime. The only suggestion I would make is not to use all the rice noodles that come with the meal. There is really not enough sauce to completely cover the noodles and the sauce is really good. I use only about 2/3 of the rice noodles and it is still plenty of food for two people."
5,Great quick meal,Great price and easy to make. You will want to have this on a cold winter day. It is simple to make and only add a few things to the package and you make a hearty warm dinner.
4,Perfectly edible Pad Thai,"Although the preparation instructions could've been a little better (for instance, soaking the rice noodles in hot tap water just wasn't sufficient: I really needed to do what another brand of Pad Thai for two had suggested, and pour BOILING water over them to ensure that they softened sufficiently to be ready to stir-fry when my wok and vegetables were ready), I was quite satisfied with the quality of Pad Thai I was able to make with this kit, even using canned bean sprouts instead of fresh.I followed the instructions mostly, though I was careful not to overcook the thawed raw shrimp I used for protein and omitted adding chopped peanuts (which I didn't have on hand) at the end. With an egg, some canned bean sprouts (though fresh are always better if you can get them and use them quickly), and chopped green onions, plus some small shrimp thawed overnight, I was able to turn this into a very satisfying main dish for two."
3,Okay but...,"There's nothing wrong with this packaged mix, but it's just approximately 8 ounces of rice noodle and an ounce of tamarind sauce; you must provide all the other ingredients.Rice noodles are cheap, and the sauce is just tamarind paste, sugar, and soy sauce--you can keep a jar of tamarind paste in the fridge for months. For what this costs, you can get pounds and pounds of rice noodle and several jars of tamarind paste. Since you have to prepare and add all of the other ingredients anyway, it only takes a couple of minutes to make the sauce, too."
1,This is not Pad Thai,"To quote my 10 year old daughter when she dove into what she considers her favorite food. ""Mom this tastes like NOTHING.""This was abysmal. I thought we were taking a short cut. My mistake. Having made pad thai from scratch, I was shocked at how little it tasted like our favorite dish.The sauce had so much sugar in it, that out of the package it tasted more like sweet chilli sauce. As another reviewer said, there wasn't enough of it and the noodles in the finished dish tasted dry and bland... not good. The only thing I could equate it to was trying to use ketchup as a substitute for Marinara sauce. We will never bother with that again."
2,Its too sweet for me.,"I love pad thai. I bought this sauce hoping to recreate my favorite dish from a local thai restaurant.Conlusion? It just isnt the same. Reading the ingredients, this is definetly not ""authenic"". Palm Sugar, Tamarind, Soy Sauce, Shallot, Pickled Radish, Garlic, Soybean Oil, Salt, Chili.Its too sweet for me. I just dont really like it. This sauce uses ALOT of tamarind, you can see the chunks in it. I'm pretty sure that my local Thai restaurant does not use tamarind, their sauce is not as dark brown. (Maybe thats the Americanized Pad Thai?)I found a Pad Thai sauce recipe online and I think I will use instead of this sauce.2 1/2 Tbs. brown sugar1 Tbs. lime juice2 1/2 Tbs. Thai Kitchen Premium Fish Sauce1 Tbs. rice vinegar1 tsp. paprika (optional)"
3,Kinda Pricy for what it is,"Fact is I need this thing. It fits my PC circular saw great. It's very light weight and long enough to not get in the way when ripping sheet goods. I have it connected to my shop vac and it does a good job collecting the stuff that would otherwise be flying through the air. But step back for a minute. It's just a plastic hose. The same stuff you can by a HD for 50 cents a foot. Ah, but the stuff at HD is not the right diameter. Gotcha. Man I wish some of this dust collection stuff would be more standard. PC is a 1"" end, my miter saw is 2"", my vacuum accessories are 1 1/4, my band saw is 2 1/2. You get the picture. I've got a drawer full of adapters. This fits the bill but they know you can't go out and buy it elsewhere. Shame."
4,A fresh breath for your power tools,"This hose is reasonbly priced. It is sturdy and flexible. It fits all my porter cable power tool with dust port (routers,sanders).Its length is conveniant and allow me to run the hose all the way to the ceiling and down to my workbench.My only complaint is that the hose requires an adapter to be able to fit on a standard shop vac port."
4,How to make it work.,"I love the way PC says it fits ""standard"" 1.5"" fittings. Anyway, I bought a Shop Vac 1-1/4"" extension wand for about $5. If you cut off the last couple inches of the wide end of the wand, it makes a perfect bushing for this hose. I will probably glue it permanently into the 1.5"" end of the hose and then it will fit the truly standard 1.25"" fittings.The hose does a good job of what it is supposed to do. PC just needs to get away from these non-standard dimensions. Did somebody in marketing think this would force people to buy PC vacs?"
2,Hose Doesn't Fit,"I bought the 39332 Vacuum hose with the 1"" port to hook up to my Porter Cable Model 340 Palm Sander and to hook up to my Porter Cable Model 7812 (10 Gallon) Vacuum Cleaner. I bought the hose and vacuum cleaner at the same time. The hose fits very nicely on the palm sander. But for the life of me I cannot figure out how it hooks up to the vacuum cleaner. Not one of the diameters fits properly anywhere.I discovered that the vacuum cleaner comes with a 1"" adapter (for just what I wanted to do). No where in the online literature is there any mention of a 1"" adapter I spent $22 for nothing."
5,Excellent,I too found this cd and picked it up many years after its original release date. I think it was kinda sabotaged by the record company w/ that horrible cover art! A mans face painting on lipstick and a suicide scar on the wrist ! Nothing says party hardy more than that. I truly enjoy all the songs on this cd and find lots of T-rex influence along with the better glamsters of the day like Hanoi and Dogs d' Amour. They share much more w/ them than bands like Poison and Motley Crue. Too bad their (musical) history ended here :-( Even though I believe the guitar player toured w/ Mike Monroe band during his dead jail or rock n roll days .
2,drag rock,"If your looking for great sleeze rock,check out loud and nasty.That issome of the best sleeze you'll ever hear.This cd is poor production andsound is'nt quite all that.Or if you don't know wildside-under theinfluence that will put you into sleeze heaven for sure!!!"
3,BtVS 4th Season,"Season 4 really isn't one of my favorites,but if you are a Hardcore Buffy Fan,this is a Must-see!New Characters are introduced such as Tara and Riley who happen to be paired up with the Main Characters later on(guess who? *shrugs*)"
4,The Beginning of the End...,"Certain episodes were as good as the previous seasons, but most were fillers and didn't meet up with the usual standards. First of all, Willow being gay??? Where did that come from? No offense, but it didn't really suit her personality up to that point, and it seemed that her character completely changed because of it.Also, Angel's absence and his replacement was just no good. Riley was good, but compared to Angel, he was out of his league in dating Buffy (sorry Riley fans!)But the worst thing was the absence of Faith. The season would have been so much better if Faith had stayed. The 2 episodes with her in them were my fav's of the season. But anyways, this season was still worthwhile after all that complaining, but you can tell that the originality was starting to go downhill. (Buy seasons 1 2 and 3!!!!!)"
4,Thanks,Everything was fine except i didn't receive the episode guide which is a booklet that usually is in every season box set. Thats about it. Thanks
4,Oh NO!!,"I was so looking forward to Season 4 as in the other regions its in 16x9 format, here in the US they hacked it to 4x3 so depressing. Still a Great Buffy season and worth getting."
3,Remember When We Thought This Was As Bad As It Could Get?,"The introduction of the Initiative, Adam, and the bland Riley (blandly played by the bland Marc Blucas) marks the beginning of the end, quality wise, for Buffy. Gone, and never to return, are the tight and inventive story arcs from the previous seasons. Instead, the writers live out their James Bond fantasies (that's how they described it) with some very boring characters, while ignoring series regulars, Giles and Xander (a situation that only gets worse in the next three seasons).The strength of this season lies in the individual episodes. Hush, Pangs, Something Blue, Who Are You, and This Year's Girl, are among the best the series has had to offer. Hush, in particular, is one of the most remarkable things I've ever seen on my televsion set. Still, for all it's flaws, the fourth season towers head and shoulders above the unwatchable mess of the sixth season, and the unending snorefest of the seventh."
5,gold,great season buffs golden year this has perect episodes i love the funny new character anna but i hate riley bufys cheating botyfriend but when angle pays a visit they still have the lust for each other great season the other new charcter tara is cool and mysteriouis
4,Only for the True Fans,"This series was okay, but if you're a true fan of Buffy, then you should buy it. I felt that this series was lacking and not as great as seasons two and three."
4,"not my favourite, but still good.","first off, I liked ""Hush"", ""Pangs"", and ""Something Blue"" the best. ""Hush"" because The Gentlemen were wonderfully creepy and the gang were hillarious in their attempts to communicate without the power of speech. (think of the projector scene). ""Pangs"" again, for the hillarity. (Spike with the arrows) and lastly, ""Something Blue"" because of the love spell that caused my two favourite people Buffy and Spike to fall in love! a MUST BUY! but you already knew that.."
3,scary,"Of every season, season 4 is the scariest season ever.hush,fear itself,primeval are some of the scary episodes. The episodes arent scary they just have scary things like the gentlemen cut peoples hearts out and professor wals is like a zombie thing and when the girl reached in the bowl and there was eyeballs."
4,The best show on television,"This season is not the strongest of the series due to the departure of the popular character Angel and the transition from high school to college. However, there are several stand-out episodes such as ""Pangs"", a Thanksgiving episode in which Angel returns unbeknownst to Buffy, ""Hush"", a hilarious and creepy episode in which no one talks for the greater part of the episode, ""Something Blue"", another hilarious one in which Willow casts a spell that causes Buffy and Spike to think they're in love as well as ""This Year's Girl"" and ""Who Am I"", which feature the return of Faith, the rogue Slayer (just to name a few). The truth is, even a ""Buffy"" episode that isn't quite up to par is much better than almost anything else shown on television. This set is a must-have for ""Buffy"" fans."
2,The worst season of Buffy by far....,"...Season 4 is considered by fans and critics alike as the worst season of Buffy. Boring plot lines, a boring villian, and even more boring boyfriend. The entire character of Riley alone ruined the entire season. What a whiney, boring, self involved character.I love all things Buffy. I have all the books from the show, the scripts, the watcher's guides, the first 3 seasons on dvd, the entire rest of the series taped, the soundtrack, the ""once more with feeling"" soundtrack, etc.......And ""hush""? it is perhaps the most over-rated episode of any tv series in history."
5,Great show!,I really love this series and the DVDs always have lots of extras. Start with season one and enjoy them all. (My husband loved it too once I talked him into giving it a shot!)
4,"Great Episodes, Bad Villan","Now, when I first bought this DVD set I got it only to further the completion of my Buffy collection. I thought that the 4th season wasn't any good...but was I wrong! Even though Adam was not a very good villian, the overall arch was very good. I love how Willow and Tara get together, and I also love Riley. Xander and Anya are histarical, as is Giles and his girlfriend, Olivia. Season 4 has some of the best episodes...EVER!! My 3 favorites are ""Pangs"" (Angel's in it!!), ""Hush"" (Silently creepy!), ""Girl of the Year"" (Faith is back and is FUNNY AS HELL!!!), and ""Who Are You"" (Part 2 of the Faith comeback). The DVD cover discribes this season. With the dark background and Sarah's lost-in-space Barbie look can be related to almost all of the episodes.(...)"
4,Buffy: The College Season,"Season Four is Buffy at college and it's the first time we get to see Harmony as a vampire (in ""The Harsh Light Of Day""). We get to see Eliza Dushku again as Faith in ""This Year's Girl"" and as Buffy in ""Who Are You?"" (I also enjoy watching her on the DVD sets of ""Tru Calling"".)And I get to see my sister's friend, Conor O'Farrell in his appearances in ""New Moon Rising"" and ""Primeval"". This season includes the classic episode ""Hush"" and we get a glimpse of the relationship between Spike and Buffy in future seasons when they become engaged because of a spell cast by Willow in ""Something Blue"". Buffy The Vampire Slayer becomes Buffy the Cavewoman in ""Beer Bad"". The last episode, ""Restless"" shows Adam, the Frankenstein creature in this season without all the makeup and gizmos. The dream sequences in this episode are as disjointed as dreams can get. Pass the cheese."
2,This was the appetizer for the Shark,"Season 4 is where ""Buffy"" jumped the shark....however, ""Hush"" cannot be ignored as one of the finest hours of TV ever. ""Restless"", ""Primeval"" and the Faith episodes are pretty good as well. But the rest of the season felt as if something was missing or off.It seems that the college experience was avoided because the writers were afraid the show would become ""Felicity the Vampire Slayer"". I can understand that but what we got was boring villains and the beginnings of some serious character assassination.Whenever FX shows the reruns, I always quit watching after ""Hush"" airs, because it's pretty much downhill from there.However, if you are a diehard BTVS fan, you'll agree, a bad episode of ""Buffy"" is still better than most of the other dreck on TV. (Reality TV --- I'm looking at you...)Season 4 is the appetizer, the following seasons, 5-7, were salad, main course and dessert for the shark."
5,All Hail to Joss Whedon! ;),"The Man is a Master Story Teller. Simple as that. In my sweeter opinion, he should win ever damn award there is.Now to the episodes, of my choice:1.Something Blue. I just adore this truly hilarious masterpiece. I about pissed my pants when we watched it first. Go Spike!2.Pangs. Ohhh. Loved the line from Spike""don't care if its playing, bloody,'rock the kazbah', just get it out"". and whew, the smirk at the end of the show. Have Mercy!3.Wild at Heart. Go Oz! You could almost hear....its gonna be a heartache tonite. One of the best sex scenes, I think!And just for good measure. I liked ""Beer Bad"", & also ""Hush"". We all want more romance/sex/love. But, I have to say, I did like the Willow/Tara arc. Just wished, that after Tara ,that Xander & Willow, would have gotten back together. Maybe, just maybe (my fingers crossed really tight) on ""Angel"". Wouldn't that be nice!"
3,Good deal with a minor drawback,"Definately a good price for the complete season but upon opening the case I noticed that the closing mechanism as well as the external casing with broken. Still, I give it three stars since there hasn't been any problems with the dvd playback."
5,Aspect ratios for region 1 and region 2,Just a quick bit of info for all you videophiles. This Buffy DVD set has the typical US television 4:3 aspect ratio. The region 2 DVD uses the widescreen 16:9 aspect ratio. Of course the region 2 DVD costs more and you need to have a DVD player which will let you play region 2 DVDs.
1,what the hell did i watch?,"this is what i wrote to my friends:Dear Cameron &Emma; i know this is gonna sound really stupid but believe me since i got that Buffy thing i 'm crazy.because i watched season4, i just don't believe it, even all that cellibey thing was better in that the r-v- show the worse comedy show in the world.so i say back off with the faith thing i think she would be perfect 4 any role in friends.but the other seasons of buffy was nice."
2,Buffy Season 4 is [weak]!,"Buffy season 4 is a horrible year, with episodes like ""Beer Bad"" and ""The Initiative"", ...? ""Hush"", ""Superstar"", ""Who are You"", ""This Year's Girl"", and ""Something Blue"" are the only good episodes, the rest are all [weak]. This year introduces Riley Finn, a [not too bright] character with no depth who seems to be a student teacher at Sunnydale University, but turns out to be working for the government along with Buffy's english teacher. It makes no sense, and is introduced out of the blue. Also, the ""big bad"" of the season is ""Adam"", a frankenstein-like creature who is introduced near the end of the season and is destroyed before the season finale, which is an irrelevant episode about dreams. Season four is very [weak],..."
5,to die for!,"what can i say? product is just amazing! features are basic but i can't complain, i got what i wanted... buffy, willow, tara, adventures ;)"
4,Buffy lost her passion.,"Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Fourth Season is the last season I watched of this once great show. Season 4, the gang starts College, and you know how those changes aren't so good for a youth-based show, 90210 anyone? Buffy's focus is scattered and implusive in season 4, the magic is gone and it was a shame to watch. Seasons 5-7 suffered greatly and a lot of characters were dropped or added which caused the show to lose its edge. I recommend season 4, there are some hidden gems but mostly you can see this show start to jump the shark."
4,Season 4 was a little different...,"Season 4 wasn't like the previous three seasons of BVtS. Instead of focusing on the demons, it had a larger focus put on the X-Files-ish Initiative. Many people had a problem with the fact that there was no major ""Big Bad"" or apparently Adamn and the Initiative weren't enough for them. I on the other hand found this change to somewhat refreshing. It gave the show a fresh feeling and wasn't, for most of the season, bogged down by the story arc. It focused on the characters and delivered some high quality episodes with a lot of humor and horror. To me this episode was a season comprised of ""filler"" episodes, those that don't push the main story arc further but are typically more fun becasue of it. All in all, I think it was a great season, even though season 5 will always be my favorite!"
2,One of the worst seasons,"Season 4...let's call it the mediocre season. The Faith/Buffy story arc, which crossed over into Angel (the far superior Season 1) and the incomparable Hush episode shined while virtually everything else...well [was bad]. Whether the bland Riley Finn character, the Initiative nonsense, or infamously the worst major villain in the entire Buffy/Angel mythos: Adam, the cyborg, (or whatever the hell he was) Season 4 could not retain the steam of the brillantly creative Season 3. Not even close. Wait for Angel Season 2, it puts this season to shame.**1/2"
3,Worth a Second Look,"The first time I saw this season, I thought that it was a steep drop-off from seasons two and three. The loss of the great gothic romance between Angel and Buffy, and the loss of Sunnydale High seemed like insurmountable odds, but the college life was actually pretty cool once you give it a chance. I wish that they had explored more of this, instead of getting bogged down with the Initiative, and Adam (worst.villian.ever.), because the transition could have been much cooler. Joss has gone on record as saying that this season could have been better, and while I agree, it's not as bad as I had originally thought."
5,magic sex!!!!,"this season was great i love the way they brought willow out,new moon rising is my favorite episode.if you are a buffy fan or even if you'r not watch this season and you may become a buffy fan,my boyfriend did not care to watch buffy until he watched some of this season.pick this season up today you'll love it!!!!"
3,The charm of the first three is there but,"Maggie Walsch, Adam and the Initiative aren't satisfying villains. Riley is a tedious character and I personally feel that this is the season where things start to fall apart. Tara, though I didn't like the idea at the beginning, is a lovely addition to the cast, while I didn't find Oz's exit particularly believable. Spike, Anya and Xander are good comic relief as well as being wonderfully drawn out characters like usual. While individually many of the episodes of Season 4 are good, as a whole it's lacking. It just can't work without an interesting big-bad. The other major problem is Marc Blucas's lack of talent, but to his credit, Riley's not much of a role.A great deal of the season is quite enjoyable, don't get me wrong. I just wouldn't reccomend this to the idealist Buffy fan."
2,Only an average Reliability Text.,"Heavy Electrical / Electronic focus. I only bought it because it was the required text for a Graduate Course, but hardly used it as I have other Reliability Engeineering texts (Modarres) which cover much of the same material in far more detail and with more clairity. I would only buy it if studying a course which closesly follows this text, otherwise, I would keep looking."
5,Prophet demystified,"SB does a truly remarkable job of portraying Huxley as he really was; from the vantage point of a next-door neighbour who soon moved in with the Huxleys, SB slowly reveals the everyday life of a man who was regarded as a prophet in his lifetime and has now come to be acknowledged as one of the most erudite men of the last century while at the same time being a humanist to the core. The book could have crossed over to being an eulogy but manages to maintain its balance and objectivity through its length and provides us with a scholarly perspective on the man as now other book does. She has integrated the personal life and impressions of many of the people who figured in Aldous's life with the works of the man and analyzes how the various experiences of his life influenced his books. It continues to remain the definitive book on Aldous Huxley three decades after its first publication."
1,Maximum Nirvana,It would help if the ad for this cd had a line close to thetop of the page telling customers that it doesnt contain any music. I didnt realize this until I received it in the mail andread the cover.
3,"It's Good, not great","I owned a similar type when I lived in San Diego, and the birds loved it. It had a larger cage area, so that small birds actually would go inside to eat. I was ALWAYS refilling it. This one however, is not made to allow small birds to enter the caged area, and they have to hang on and some seem to be nervous about putting just their head through the wired openings, always looking over their shoulder. For some reason, it isn't as popular as the 2 other types of feeders I have, but I do see birds from time to time using, or attempting to use it. Perhaps it is the location--being by a window."
3,"Not bad, but has a colgging issue","I've used this feeder for a couple of years now. I use it on a pole, though it does come with a loop for hanging. The user who mentioned having to undo screws to add food must not have noticed that the top just twists/screws off (no tools required, and very easy to do). Filling it is not a problem.The problem that I have had with it is that the bottom openings for food become clogged with seed debris and becomes so solid that the birds can't clear it out. With the bottom holes clogged, the only remaining openings are the top ones. Once the food level is below the top holes, the feeder is effectively empty, and needs to be filled again. I have taken the feeder completely apart, cleaned it with a hose, and put it back together. The bottom holes remained usable for about a week before they became clogged again. I'm looking for something new."
5,Very helpful tool for small non profits,"I was very motivated by Fundraising for Dummies. In fact I suggested that all of my board of directors get a copy. Fundraising is one of our least favorite things to do. We would much rather be out there ""doing what we do"", but it is essential for staff and board to wear many hats when you are a small non profit organization. We have been blessed with several grants over the last few years, and realized this year that grant funding is like the rest of the economy, way down. It is not possible to hire a professional fundraiser, so we are taking on this task ourselves and Katherine Murray and John Mutz have a simple way of explaining and building confidence in your ability to communicate with potential donors and members, branding your organization and creating a fundraising plan."
4,OMG fundraising could be a second job,"I spent many informative minutes reading this book between naps. It is thorough and probably as easy a read as anyone is likely to find on this subject. If your looking for a simple approach to fundraising I think it is fair to say that it is a lot less involved to stick-up liquor stores than to embark on a legal fundraising campaign. However, for those who want to keep out of jail, this is probably a good bet."
5,Good book for any level of fundraising experience,I have some fundraising experience but am involved in a new organization just getting started. This book is a fast read and organized in such an accessible way that you can quickly get the things you need to start working right away.
1,Boring and not helpful,I have some idea what fundraising is. Don't buy this unless you don't know that some people ask other people for money.This book covers the basics but nothing else.Do you know what an Annual Fund is? How about Planned Giving? Great! You know more about fundraising than this book will tell you.Avoid this book and buy a book on selling or on marketing instead.
3,There are better books,"I have been in fundraising for years and am always looking for additional resources. While the ""Dummies"" series are good generally, fundraising is too important to be treated superficially."
3,Interesting if you know the area,This book is about the Elk River in West Virginia and the people from the area. The author writes about many of my ancestors in this book making it of interest specifically to me. He mentions the fish camp where my grandfather and his brothers earned their living. The book is interesting reading if you know the area it's written about and can relate.
5,TALE OF THE ELK,"IT IS A GREAT BOOK. MY HUSBAND's GREAT GRANDFATHER IS IN IT. I READ IT MANY YEARS AGO AT THE LIBRARY. BUT NOW, I COULD NOT READ IT. IT IS JUST FOR REFERENCE AT THE MAIN LIBRARY. SO, THANK GOODNESS. AMAZON HAD IT. LOVE IT AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH!"
5,Encyclopedic and entertaining,"The Editorial Review above is correct in saying ""Taliaferro discusses every conceivable aspect of the monument."" The book serves as a biography of sculptor Gutzon Borglum, giving us chapters about his early life and other sculptures prior to Mt. Rushmore. There are chapters devoted to the local Indians and President Coolidge's very brief visit as well. If it has anything to do with the history of Mt. Rushmore, it's in this book. Lucky for us, Taliaferro is skilful writer/historian. This book is never dull or pedantic; it's always fascinating and entertaining. With books like this, I sometimes find myself skipping forward over the slow parts. ""Great White Fathers,"" like Taliaferro's biography of Edgar Rice Burroughs, ""Tarzan Forever"", contains no slow parts."
1,wrong dust bag,"dont buy this porter cable 39334 dust bag for your porter cable 324 mag circular saw, it wont fit. there is no bag for this saw"
1,BE CAREFUL WITH THIS,"I purchased this to go with a circular saw I purchased on the same Order.This does not fit on the saw I ordered; I always check, and didn't see any type of information to indicate this product would not fit on that saw.Amazon needs to pay more attention to the accessory items it offers when you purchase an item, to make sure the products assigned to individual ID numbers are compatible."
3,Not very clear,"If you buy this, make sure it fits. I assumed it would work on my new Cole-Porter circular saw - I don't think it does. I did not open it because it did not look like it would fit. More importantly, the numbers on the package did not correspond to my saw model number. So it should work only on ""some"" Cole Porter saws. I could be wrong, but I'm going with my Cole Porter vacuum extension - that does work with my saw."
3,"Slim'n'cool-lookin', lousy interface design","First impression: nice and sleek looking. Not super slim as they claimed, but significantly less bulky than your typical walkman.Other pluses: use a single AAA battery, rather than 2 AA batteries. Very light weight, yet sturdy. Decent sound, though with the XBS seems too strong for me.Now the minuses. A major pet peeve of mine is the user interface design. I need to hit different buttons up to for 4 times to access a certain preset radio station!! Not intuitive, nor convenient at all!! Also the bulky headphone is black, which doesn't match the player itself. I've actually seen the same player with a slick, silver ear-bud headphone, with a built-in control, in Asian on-line stores, though it seems to cost more. Still, that would have been much better. Last, it doesn't come with a strap, buckle or any other accessories."
5,It's good man,"i got this one as a gift from a friendit was a very nice gifti used it like 6 hours a day and it never cause me any problemsand i mean never!easy to use, small size, many good optionsi love it"
5,Excellent must have DVD!,"As both a fan of The Gathering and live music, this is the ultimate dvd/cd.The Gathering is one of the best live bands I have seen and this is one of the better performances of them I can remember. Of course a lot of the ambience you can feel when you are actually there is missing because it can never be translated onto a dvd/cd but you can still see and feel it must have been amazing to be there.My absolute favorite is the title track, A Noise Severe. It is so powerfull when played live, it is absolutly moving me to tears every time. But songs like Travel and In Motion are also very good. There are no bad songs on this dvd/cd!Still amazing this great band is so little known but if you are not afraid of taking a chance, grabbed this fabulous performance! I guarantee you will be blown away by Anneke's voice and the enthousism of the band."
3,"hmmm, Wusthof name, cheap product","Not what I was expecting AT ALL. With the Wusthof name, you come to expect a certain standard of quality and appearance. These knives look just like something you might find at a discount store (with the exception that the price would be even better). Very light and not appealing to look at. Frankly I am sorry I purchased these knives. I will purchase the Wustof brand again, but not their new, cheap ""silver point"" collection."
1,Do not buy these knives,Knives are no better than any thing you can pick up at a 99 cent store. They feel cheap and will rust.
1,Wusthof Silverpoint= Junk!,Don't buy these knives. They rust and one just snapped off while my wife was spreading goat cheese. I just so happen to be on-line looking for a contact to return these knives and thought I'd post my first review on Amazon. Don't buy these knives.
3,"Fast shipping, quality lacking","I am not convinced that these filters are a MERV 12 rating. The material seems to be thinner & less of it than the Honeywell filter that I removed from my furnace. On a good note, the shipping was speedy."
3,Size isn't what it said,"The size of these filters was actually almost an inch smaller than stated on the listing. This means that they do not fit snugly in the air vent. If you really need 25 x 16 x 4 inches, these are NOT the filters to buy. Other than the fact that they are the wrong size, I guess they are fine."
2,Misleading Product Description,"The product description ""16x25x4-MERV12 A/C Furnace Filters by Nordic Pure (Box of 6)"" is misleading. The actual size is 15 1/2 x 24 1/2 x 3 5/8. This information is on the filter but not provided in the online information/details of the product."
3,Good value for the money,"So much cheaper than buying it from the store, Product was good and was shipped promptly with care. Will buy again."
3,Good for the price,"It is a good spec for the price.But dimension is 1/4"" smaller so it is not a tight fit to existing honeywell slot."
2,"Not sized like the competition, smaller than advertised","Not sure how this filter will hold up during the heating season but I am disappointed in the size it came in. Ordered a 16 x 25 x 4 to replace the 3m's I have been using from Lowes. I didn't know these filters were sized like 2 x 4's. This filter is not 4"", instead more like 3 1/2"" wide. Very disappointing how it fits. I know its much cheaper, now I know why."
4,The Revolving Mask of Yamantaka,"This is a very good album featuring Mickey Hart, Henry Wolff & Nancy Hennings. Mickey said after the album's original release that it was basically a Henry and Nancy album that he helped out on. It's good if your into meditation and you like new age music but once again, it's not the kind of thing that you'll play alot."
2,Sound is not the best,I bought this to use at work to replace another unit I gave to my parents to use. I thought the idea of the bass thing that rests on the back of your neck was a neat idea. I wish I could have tested it out before I bought it. The sound quality of this is far from the best I have heard. You can not turn the volume up too high because of distortion. The bass thing is not that great. Like mentioned the headphones are very uncomfortable after a little while and other headphones will sound even worse cause this unit is made to work with the VMSS headphones that come with it. I think the VMSS is what makes this kind of pricey casue I have seen the same features in other brands that cost less... save your money and get a better sounding unit cheaper.
3,somewhat unsatisfactory,"I like the overall look and feel of this portable cd-player, however, the sound quality leaves a lot to be desired. The headphones themselves are quite a neat idea with the pseudo-subwoofer in the back, but it doesn't usually add to the bass and the earbud-like protrusions themselves don't fit well enough to have much bass or clarity on their own. The main problem with the sound however, comes from the headphone jack itself. Basically, the headphone jack on this model seems to have a somewhat poor power output and it distorts the sound very easily, even at low volumes. Compared to other panasonic portable cd-players, the sound output is really quite poor. Even with the use of a headphone amp the sound still distorts very easily."
5,One of the best compilations for classical music!,I would find it hard to believe that any lover of classical musics would be let down or unhappy with this collection! Five stars!
4,Earth's Fury,"It is a very clear book, and it has many ilustrations to show the natural hazards in ""action"".Useful as a reference book for applied Geology."
5,Directing the Choral Music Program,"Better than ""new"" edition! Quick turn around time and prompt receipt of item. I recommend this seller."
5,Finally the Early Jeff Lorber Fusion on CD!,"This is a long overdue release. The only thing that would be better is if they actually released all the late 70s early 80s Jeff Lorber Fusion albums on CD. I have all of them, but there is nothing like CD quality, especially when they have been remastered as these songs have. There is absolutely more definition coming out of the speakers from this CD than the original records. Would have preferred more from Water Sign, Wizard Island & Galaxian & less of the later tunes but it is fantastic to hear the original versions of Tune 88, Toad's Place, Rain Dance, Fusion Juice, City and Spur of the Moment in all their remastered glory. I will take what I can get. Maybe Mr. Lorber will release a ""Part II"" with more of the early gems! This is must buy for any fan of Jazz Fusion or Jeff Lorber."
3,Not as Soulful as Later Work,"I've been a big Jeff Lorber fan for several years on the strength of his last four releases, including ""State of Grace,"" Worth Waiting For"" and ""Midnight."" Along with many other fans, I have often wondered why his earlier albums had not been reissued on CD and so eagerly looked forward to this collection when it was released. With that said, while I generally enjoyed the songs on this collection, I must admit that the music isn't as soulful and introspective as his later work. I found it to be like a lot of circa-1970's fusion: blisteringly hot and hip but almost a little too showy for my taste. Lorber's later music exudes a warmth and soulfulness that is hard to describe but he makes an electric piano sound as warm and fresh as any player in jazz today. One nice surprise in the collection is discovering that Kenny G can indeed play and play hard which you wouldn't know from his boring solo work."
5,At Last!,"I have been a die-hard fan of Jeff Lorber for 20 years! I used to wistfully think to myself...""if only Jeff Lorber would make a CD of his old stuff..."" All I can say is THANK YOU!"
4,Do it right or not at all...,"I've also been a Lorber fan since the late 70s, and also have always been annoyed that his recordings from that timeframe have not been available on CD. When I heard about a ""Greatest Hits"" album, I admittedly had a lukewarm reaction; I hoped for a 2 CD set, which even then would be hard-pressed to include what I feel it should as a minimum Lorber collection. When I found it was only 1, I decided to hold off and just listen to my old albums, since so many great tunes have been left out. For example, everything from Wizard Island and Lift Off should be here. Kenny G? Please - some of Jeff's best stuff had little if any Kenny G on it (""Reflections,"" for example). But if you're one of these ""smooth jazz"" fans who would be happy with a sampler of Jeff Lorber's older stuff, it's worth the purchase."
5,When fusion was fusion.......,"As a few of the reviewers before me, I can only wonder why Arista has not released the BEST of Jeff Lorber.....not this collection (which is great), but namely ""Galaxian"" and ""It's A Fact."" One would think that Arista would cash in on the popularity of Kenny G, who in my opinion does his best playing with Jeff Lorber. If my words mean anything, PLEASE, PLEASE, Arista give the listeners what they want!! If you are a buyer wanting something new and great, buy this CD, then you'll understand what my fellow ""Lorberers"" mean when we say we want it all......"
2,Wont stick to walls,This holder is not what it appears. It keeps falling off the walls and they only way to secure it is to tape or nail it to the walls. No what i exspected.
5,be prepared for the social occasion,"The book Etiquette and Modern Manners by John Morgan, who died much too young in a tragic accident in 2000, is published by the British publishing house Debrett's, publisher of many authoritative social reference guide books. Some advice you might find overdone. However, if you follow the suggestions when in doubt you can hardly go wrong. This guide covers many things, such as entertaining, dressing or writing letters in correct style. For example, this book informs you about the correct way to address people with titles and what to do if you are invited to a shooting party. We like John Morgan?s style as he always tries to explain why an etiquette would make sense. For some it might be an old fashioned thing of the past, but if you would like to be prepared for that social occasion, this book will give you some reliable advice."
4,A hilarious spoof of the English upper classes,"With the care of an anthropologist and the pizazz of Jacqueline Susann, John Morgan brings the life of the English upper classes (and the whalebone corsetry of customs that confine them) to life. I would have given four stars, except that there are places where the author's imagination dips towards the mundane, and Morgan's chapter on hunting goes several paces beyond the plausible. If you've never cried tears of laughter, I recommend this work."
5,Very entertaining and informative,"This book is full of information on how to steer your way through most social situations. At times, it is very amusing and entertaining as it seems a bit over the top but the information is invaluable if you are attending high end social events or just want to know how to behave in a more refined fashion."
5,The most delightful etiquette book out there,"Some people read cook books. Some people read garden tips. I read etiquette books, old and new, domestic and foreign. I like this about one, or that about another. This wonderful book is delightful. It is in many fewer sections than the Vanderbilt or Post. It sort of heads things out in the universal take (with something of a more Anglo sensibility than Post is say ""American"" but it works in the writing style) then with the slight variations for subsets of areas of difference (religion or regional et cet) The author has a very droll sense of style and humor that is appealing. I know that I haven't mentioned how it is as a reference book- it is good. Granted, I haven't received my invitation from the palace yet, but should I -- it lays out exactly what one should and should not do. Highly recommended, highly enjoyed."
3,Britain's Etiquette Guide,"I purchased this book in error. When I ordered it, I did not appreciate that it is considered ""BRITAIN'S most authoritative etiquette guide"". I was looking for some guidance on U.S.manners and etiquette. Amazon's write up does not make it clear that this book addresses British etiquette. I'm sure its a great book for what it is, i.e. if you are travelling or relocating to Brittain. For good ol' American do's and dont's you'd best stick with Miss Manners. I mistakenly purchased this book because I wanted to update my 20 year old edition of Miss Manners."
5,Great CD!,"I really enjoyed Lorrie's second greatest hits ""To Get To You"", I really enjoyed her cover of ""Angel"" and think that should have been the lead off single. I also enjoyed ""If I Cry', but ""Whoop-De-Doo"" and ""To Get To You"", are easlily forgettable. She also does a great re-make of Tammy Wynette's ""Another Lonely Song"". Lorrie has always been so un-promoted by her now departed record label BNA. Which in my opinion is one of the worst in the country music field. This lady has more talent in her pinkie then Shania Twain, Faith Hill, Martina Mcbride, and those stupid Dixie Chicks. She is true country class, she is a true singer. Her old hits are just as good as the first time you heard them. I would recommend this CD to anyone. I wish Lorrie continued success, and hope she gets with a new record label that will promote her the way she deserves."
3,Decent Sandals,"I own two other pairs of tsubos. One thing always draws me to them...comfort. These sandals are on the low-end of the comfort scale. Something is off with the weight (they are pretty heavy and bulky) and the distribution of such weight is strange. I bought the black pair and if you are like me the first few times you where them your feet will be dyed a dark shade of blue- especially when they get wet. All in all I would not buy another pair of tsubo sandals, stick to what they do best- dress/casual shoes."
1,Snake Oil Anyone?,"People do outrageous things for psychological relief. This book is among the litany of self-help books that are offered up on the snake-oiled palms of tricksters like St. John who suck money from the suffering masses.The inauthentic imprimatur of St. John can be summed up most effectively as an undifferentiated mass of useless blather.The self-help field is riddled with self-annointed experts with no formal education or personal experience in what they preach. As with most overzealous self-help proselytisers, their own background is incongruous with their message. For instance, John Gray, author of ""Men are From Mars Women are From Venus"" has a history of failed relationships as does the co-author of ""The Rules""How can someone lead others to the well when they haven't found it themselves? More importantly, how do they sleep at night deceiving others?"
1,Victimization,"Author spends first part of the book wringing his hands over how his Dad left him ill equipped for succeeding in life. It's not very empowering to suggest to people that they have to ""ask"" others for permission to succeed. This book is more about words and semantics than it is about concrete action."
5,I wish this book was written 20 years ago,"I have been searching for years, and like so many others, have spent a fortune on self-help books. I started each book with such enthusiasm, but ended up with the same defeatist results. I stumbled on this book, and from the first page I got the feeling that someone was reading my mind and soul. I haven't even finished it yet, and already I have a clarity that I never could find before. This book is a must read for anyone who is sick of hitting brick walls. Noah St. John, thank you from the bottom of my heart. You have taken me back to square one and helped me to know that there is a 'real life'waiting for me to live and truly enjoy! God bless you-"
2,Good idea. . . but poorly written.,The author throws a good idea into the self-help arena but the book really needs some serious editing. The sentence structure is so bad that I thought I was reading his first draft. I believe that the author even claims to have written the book in a matter of a few weeks. I have no doubt that he's telling the truth! Maybe a high-school english teacher should give this one a good workout.
1,"Poorly written, no credibility, disappointing",I was disappointed with this book and doubt that Mr. St.John even has a Ph.D . The book is poorly written and is something that a teacher in junior high or high school would give some fine editing to. I am trying to figure out how one with a Ph.D would be able to create such a terrible piece of work. Mr.St.John does not seem to demonstrate anything about any success that he has had in the world or in life. It all just seems to be a bunch of psychobabble taken from previously read self-help books. What is there that is tangible proof of any success in any arenas of life except that of being a self-proclaimed guru and speaker on success?
5,Amazing - What women should say more often and men listen to,"Lupita D'alessio brough to the surface what women all over the world, particularly in Mexico have been feeling all the time. Ms. D'alessio was the target of unfair discrimation from all society, including women, because she interpreted in a very special and powerful way what we women have to say, and what men must hear. My respect and admiration to this woman, her songs, and her music."
5,Great!!,The sun dial is better than I hoped. It is just the right size and is a great conversation starter. I highly recommened it!
4,Sony Quality,"This a good quality receiver. The price is comparable with most of the other receivers in this class. The big difference that I see is legendary Sony quality. I own many Sony products and have been pleased with their performance. I think this is one instance where a ""name brand"" will pay off. Sony doesn't make any ""junk products""!"
4,Very good value.,"Bought this model about ten years ago, and mine still looks and sounds brand new - and it has been used a lot. No clicking or any other noise. It isn't as good as my NAD C-740, but shouldn't be at less than 1/2 the price. My main system comprises Lexicon and Adcom separate components at many times the price of the Sony. This Sony is part of a tertiary system and has been an almost daily use workhorse powering small speakers. It's 100wpc output is not as robust as those found in pricier units, but will be adequate for most users - I certainly disagree with the reviewer who characterized it as 20wpc, but do agree it is not a high-current design; nor does it cost like one. It is a competent, reliable receiver with a fairly sensitive FM, great remote control features and competes very well in this price range. I do not use Megabass, either - way too phat. Well worth picking up used if in the condition of mine."
4,Covers a surprisingly large area,"I normally water by hand, but with a vacation coming up, I needed a system to water my vegetables. I purchased this along with theOrbit 91213 One-Dial Garden Hose Digital Water Timerlocally.Well, I spent the afternoon getting wet! I started by getting the sides mixed up on which way the water would spray, then seriously underestimated the size of the spray pattern. It's OK, it was a hot day outside, and I can't remember the last time I played in a sprinkler.I needed the spray to be able to reach some hanging plants, and it more than adequately did so. I set the area I was watering for fifteen minutes, and it covered it quite nicely. I will be watching the area the next few days to see if it is adequate, but so far it seems to be the right amount of time.I especially appreciate that the oscillation gently waters the area without leaving soggy spots. It is much gentler than my hurry up spraying that I have been doing."
5,REINCARNATION?? THIS WILL MAKE A BELIEVER OUT OF YOU...,"If you ever wondered about reincarnation, this book may make a believer out of you.This book explores Sylvia's experiences as a degreed hypnotherapist who has come across many supposedly ""unsolvable"" cases where past life regression revealed the link to some of the baffling ills suffered by clients in this lifetime. There are many fascinating case studies, that have later been back researched and verified by historical census records and other historical public records."
4,"A MIND OPENER (or should I say ""Spirit Awakener""?)","I have quickly become a huge Sylvia fan as some of her principles are very close to Neal's ""Conversations with God"". What I love about Sylvia is her detailed descriptions of the other world and past lives. Neal and her books have been the first things regarding God, Jesus, ""the other side""/heaven, that have struck 'true' to me. It's a wonderful book full of inspirational stories and even a tool at the end to help you perform your own past life regression."
5,Slyvia is FANTASTIC!!!,"I own so many books and tapes of Sylvia's collections. She has changed my life! This book was just another hit with me. I just began to feel better day after day when reading any of her books. And when you can let go of some fears and memory of past lives affecting your present life, things begin to get better. She knows how to touch the soul and positive changes have happened in my life. God Bless you Sylvia and what you have done for so many souls! Love and Light ~ Lisa"
1,Past life Future Healings,This book came very used and some of the pages were torn and I missed a few of the words so I was not happy with this book sent to me used. I have ordered many used books that have come come in very good condition but I will not order from this company again.
5,Surprised,"I had not read any of Sylvia Browne's books but had covered the same subject matter of many other authers. Sylvia brings a fresh look to the subject without wordiness. I was pleasently surprised, couldn't put the book down and finished it in one day."
4,Entertaining but is it real? who knows,This book is definitely entertaining to read though I wonder if its real or not. I guess people believe in what they want to believe. I read this book with an open mind and thought it was pretty good. The last couple of pages were about how to find out about your own past life (teaching you how to hypnotize) ¡ well lets just say It didn¡t work for me. I thought it would be fun if it worked but guess you need to have a lot of patience or be naturally good at hypnotizing people to make it work (or maybe it doen't work at all). I gave up after reading through 2nd page of ¡Relaxation¡ it¡s more aggravating then relaxing reading through all the mambo jumbo she wrote in the book.¡GeezBottom line is that the book it self was entertaining to read.The credibility of Sylvia Brown is questionable especially after checking out her website.It seemed like her focus was after the money rather than to help people.
3,interesting,"As with all of Sylvia's books that I have read so far it kept me interested, opened my mind and made me ask questions. I feel that if anything I read makes me think then it must be good. I have made so many positive changes in my life and have found a peace I never knew existed since being touched by the works of Sylvia that it would be impossible to not see or to accept this fact."
4,It is very accurate,"This is a good book. The author obviously has experienced Samadhi. Another good book is 'Autobiography of a Yogi', by Pramahansa Yoganananda."
5,"Outstanding Customer Service, Nice Product","My wife had a lot of trouble pumping milk during the first ten days after delivery.I called Medela customer service and told them the Pump-In-Style was not working. They offered to send us a brand new pump in exchange for our existing one, that we could then return to Amazon to get our money back.We decided to try it out some more, and it started working quite effectively after a few days. There is some medical literature giving evidence that breast pumps can be ineffective just after a caesarean.In any case, now we have a nice product from a company that gives great customer service."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this pump several months before I had my son. I began using it immediately after he was born. In less than 1 year, the rubber plastic vacuum cap developed a hole in it and the pump no longer had adequate suction. I have no idea how this happened, as you must take the pump apart to even see this. Anyway, Medela does not repair this part or offer replacement. It is also no longer under warranty - warranty covers 1yr from date of purchase on this part. Although I had not used it for one year, the date of purchase is what's important. I called Medela and they offer no assistance. This is obviously a product flaw. I am extremely disappointed that I have to purchase a new pump, which is a big expense. I am also currently renting a hospital pump which is also expensive and not a long term solution, especially if we choose to have another child. I'm very hesitant to purchase another medela."
4,Works great,The pump works great.SO much better than my previuos Evenflo pump.Makes very less noise.It is Truely virtually hands free.But the battery pack wouldn't work.That's why 4 star.
3,Too expensive and couldn't get milk!,Everyone said this was the gold standard and that it would help keep up my supply... not sure if it's because I am a plus-size mama or what but I couldn't get ANYTHING with this pump. I got more with hand expressing! Add to the fact that it is violently overpriced and this time around I'm going with an ISIS.
1,Don't buy from BP Medical,This product is great but do NOT buy it from BP Medical. You cannot return an unopened and unused product for a full refund - they charge a 15% restocking fee that is not disclosed at the time of purchase!
1,Manufacturer refuse warranty service,"I bought one 2 months ago and the electronic stop working. Called manufacturer about the so called ""12 months warranty"", not only I need to pay all the shippings, but the problem was ""because of misuse"" and refuse to cover the repair cost. I am just a regular customer, never see this kind of manufactuer warranty before."
5,Great pump for working moms!,I bought this pump to use when I went back to work full time 9 weeks after my son was born. I have been using it 3x a day at least 5x a week for the past 2.5 months and it works great! Very easy to use and comfortable. The black bag makes it very discreet to carry around as well. My only suggestion is to buy a hands free pumping band so you don't have to hold the cups while you are pumping (I bought the Made by Moms pumping band off of baby center). Definitely worth the money for full time working moms!
5,the ultimate breast pump,in my opinion there is no other pump out there that can even compete with this one. in addition to its compact size it is perfect for an on the go mom.
4,Must have for working moms,"This pump really got was worth the $$. I nursed my son for 15 months and couldn't have done it without this pump. I work full time and found that this was quick and easy. By the way - I figured the cost of the pump, the cost of the nursing bras and pads, and the cost of the storage bags, PLUS, we bought an extra freezer to store milk in - and I figured I still saved over $500 over formula feeding in just the cost of the formula for that 1st year. A quick tip, though - don't buy the extra milk containers. Gerber sells 6 oz baby bottles for $3 - $5 for four of them. They screw onto the breast shields and go in the dishwasher just fine. I found this much cheaper."
5,Good Pump for the price,"My son is just about 8 months old now and I figured I would jump online and start reviewing some of the products I have used. When I was pregnant, I found the reviews helpful, so I thought I would add to the feedback....Although I have not tried the more up-to-date pumps, I bought this one because it was more affordable and it has worked just fine for me. I have not had to replace any of the attachments, they have all held up just fine and at 8 months.... its still doing just fine. I'm hoping it will last me for my 2nd baby, seems like it will make it!! Good quality for the price."
5,Loved it,"I couldn't express breastmilk with any other pump. This one was awesome! It's pretty darn loud, but I think it's worth it.I definitely recommend this. If you're going to spend money on a pump, you might as well do it right!"
2,Question regarding this product...,Is it just me or somebody else has also experienced this: I cannot get even a drop of milk by using In Style Medela while I am successful using a manual pump. I spoke with Medela consultant who told me that it will take a week until milk is starting to come out. One week? Did anyone else experiece this???
5,As expected..,"The item was received as expected, within the expected date range.There was no tracking number provided, but when I called up the sender, I got an immediate response/detail."
2,Lost suction quickly.,"I actually recieved this breast pump system free from my insurance company. I had purchased a $35 system from Babies-R-Us before my son was born as a cheap option. My son had trouble nursing and by the time he was 3 weeks old, I had to pump my milk and feed it to him in a bottle. I used this pump at first, and had a hard time. It wouldn't express much milk when I had it set up to do both sides at the same time. No matter how high I turned the suction, it wasn't enough to express my milk. So I used it one side at a time, and that seemed to be better, but only for the first maybe 10 times that I did it. After that it seemed to loose suction completely, and I resorted to my $35 electric one side pump, which had at least twice the suction this expensive pump ever had. Thank goodness I didn't have to pay for this pump, because it would have been a waste of money."
5,Almost as good as the hospital-grade pump,"After using the Ameda hospital grade pump and this product, I have to say that there is not that big a difference. The hospital grade pump was a little more efficient, but all in all, there is the same amount of cleaning and I actually got about the same amount of milk."
5,The best!,"I bought this after using an Avent Isis hand pump and taking 45 minutes to get 1 1/2 oz.Pump In Style works great! It only takes me 8-10 minutes to pump 3-4 oz on each breast. I am a stay at home mom, so I do not need to pump quite as much as if I was working. But if you don't mind spending the money, I highly recommend this. Pumping allowed me to go out even when my baby was only a few months old and still breast feeding every 2-3 hrs. I could have a bottle with me and not have to worry about finding a place to breastfeed. (I don't feel comfortable nursing in plain view of the public if I didn't need to).Also I went out with my husband to a 5-6 hr company party and brought this pump with me. I went to a public rest room and used the battery pack. It worked great!! It was not loud at all!"
4,Good Pump,"This is a great pump, especially for helping to establish a good milk supply and for occasional expression needs. If you are planning on using a pump long term or fairly frequently, consider the advanced pump-in-style. I have heard that it is more efficient and helps with a quicker let-down. I use my pump in style at work and only have about 10 minutes to duck into the bathroom and pump, so something that would make the process faster would be great! This is a good, solid pump. I have been using it almost every day since my daughter was born, almost seven months ago, and it has worked great. Medela has wonderful customer service to help troubleshoot problems, and it is really easy to pack and store the expressed milk. All around a good pump!"
5,LOVE IT!,"I have used my PIS 1-3x per day for the last 7 months with NO problems. I love this pump. It's very easy to throw it over your shoulder and take it with you. I am a busy student and this pump has survived several months of being stuffed under chairs, into lockers, and thrown into the backseat of my car with little wear and tear. I've never had a problem letting down, and the milk comes quickly.Really, no complaints...I think this a great pump and worth every penny."
5,GREAT pump,"I purchased a pump from a different manufacturer which stopped working 2 weeks after I began using it (baby was born 10/1/12). I contacted the company who did not offer a solution other than returning the pump for a refund so I was forced to purchase a new pump. I had already looked into Medela's pump but was nervous about the price; what's the difference in pumps really? Well, now I know! This pump is SO worth the price. I've been using it upwards of 4 times a day for 2 months and it works amazing!! I love the case it comes in and the ease of putting it together to use. I go back to work in 2 weeks and am confident that I'll continue to love this pump while using it at the office."
2,loses suction....not worth the money,I bought this pump and at first it worked great. Then it started to lose suction. I researched and found out that this was a problem that the company knows about. I called and they said they couldn't help me since I wasn't the original owner and besides all pumps lose suction. Not worth the money!
5,Must have for working moms!!,I can't say enough about how wonderful this pump is. It is worth the price if you are a working mom who will need to pump often. I went back to work at six weeks post-pardum and this pump allowed me to continue breastfeeding my son until 8 months old when I gave it up for health reasons. The pump is not hard to use or assemble and it is much more efficient than a manual or single breast pump. I have the backpack style model and I didn't feel like people could even tell what it was when I would cart it in to work on my shoulder. I am expecting again and planning to use it this time around as well. This product was a lifesaver for me!
2,Glass jar works. Blade arrived inoperable.,"I purchased this as a gift. The glass jar assembly works aside from the blade, which was inoperable. Luckily the recipient was able to use her original blade. (Her glass jar had broken.)"
3,GOOD QUALITY FAIR PRICE,"Compared to the cost of the orginal from Oster, the price was much lower and the quality looks good."
4,Works Great.,"I bought this to replace my blender bowl that was lost during a move. It works perfectly. I even dropped it and it didn't break. The lid is cheap hard plastic, but I actually like it better than the original rubber lid. It's easy to take on and off when adding stuff during the blending process."
1,Horrrible product with Horrible service,"I tried to replace a large Oster Blender jar. I purchased the product from Goodman's. The jar was smaller than advertised and the bottom to the jar did not fit properly and leaked all over. What made things worse was the fact that goodman's customer service was horrible. They had a poor response time, no customer relations skills, refused to deal with the problem, and I ended up throwing out the blender and going to a department store to buy a new one. The whole total event ended up costing me $67."
1,Not recommended!,"My replacement blender top never arrived, because Goodman's did not put a tracking number on the package, so UPS returned it to sender. They never responded when I inquired about my order, so I had to file a claim with Amazon to get a refund. Ug, such a waste of time! I would definitely avoid ordering from Goodman's!"
1,Disappointed,"I bought a replacement blender top about a year ago - it was a round one and was excellent quality. I had an extra motor base and we set up a new apartment for my kids so I needed another. I though I would try this square one from Goodman's.The bottom section does not seat correctly into the Oster motor base correctly and rocks. The blades are cheap looking - something is not right with them. They make extra noise. The glass is fine, but the lid is made of a cheap hard plastic with sharp edges where it came out of the mold. It is not the rubbery one like on the previous model. It also does not seat correctly into the glass.This replacement was made in Mexico. They did a poor job. Don't get this one. Hopefully the round 5 cup blender is the same as the one I got a year ago - get that one instead."
3,Okay for the price,"It all fit fine, but as a replacement, the quality took a short dive. Lid was cheap, stiff plastic. The blades don't cut as well as the original. Overall, an okay replacement..."
4,"Works, but not EXACTLY the same as original parts","Although all the parts fit the Oster beehive blender model, the black plastic bottom piece isn't from Oster and isn't as good as the original. The replacement piece is thinner than the original. Hopefully it holds up."
2,The color of the lid was different from a picture. It wasn't black and was white.,"I wanted both of a white lid and a black lid.A lid of the accessory saw a picture, and was black, so though a white lid was bought additionally intentionally, it's different from a picture, and something white has also reached a lid of the accessory.In the long run there were no lids with a black white lid. To the extent I'd like to complain."
1,IT DOESN'T WORK! DON'T BUY --,"This glass jar replacement doesn't work! You put it together carefully, try to screw the bottom tight (it won't screw tight -- just keeps going around, fill it, try to put the lid on (it won't go on; too big), put it on the blender base, blend it, take it off, and it falls apart and empties onto the floor. Several of us tried it different times and ways, and it won't work!! I returned it for a refund and received the refund, but they refused to refund my $10.00 UPS cost for returning it to them. DON'T BUY IT! --Maurine Fronckowiak, Amherst, NYBlender Jar Bottom Cap for Oster & Osterizer Blenders"
3,Jar Good Plastic Top Not great,I bought this in an effort to save my old blender that had a chipped bottom. The lid that was included is stiff plastic and did not easily fit the jar. I ended up buying a new blender at Costco for $10 more than this jar assembly cost. I wish that had been my first thought.
2,OK - but not original,"It seems to work fine, but it is not original Oster. The original screw on base does not fit the new jar. Also, the plastic top is white, not black."
3,It's just ok,"This replacement does not quite fit the older models. The included plastic lid does not fit at all. I use the old base with the new jar, and I am using the old lid with the new jar. One should think that the items of a kit at least fit together? Not the case in this case!"
4,good value,This is priced for use. The company was very receptive when the bottle came broken and replaced it promptly.I have been using the jar daily and it works for me.
3,Nothing wrong with it,Works well on our blender. Nothing wrong with it though I wish the blade was not as sharp. I am afraid to cut myself every time I am cleaning it.
3,"Jar ok, but top bad","The glass jar is good so far, but the top that came with it is a rigid plastic top, not a flexible rubber one that come with the blender initially. Because of it being a rigid plastic one, there are gaps where the glass hat meets the top, and allows liquid to leak through."
3,Worth the price for the glass pitcher,"The rest of the parts the come with it are cheap knock-off replacements, even the ""Oster"" branded blade which did not have bearings in it. If you broke your pitcher for you Osterizer, make sure to keep your original blade, lid, and base."
3,Careful what you are buying,"Be careful and note the item number 53125. This model only fits Porter Cable saws 314,345,845. Check the description on the 53124 for the others.I ordered this in good faith, but LaPollos is not willing to take back, even though there description is wrong. Actually, they would take it back and charge me a fee for opening, plus shipping back to the them and then then new one back to me. I bought the 53124 on-line at another merchant."
4,Exciting Spy Film,"I love Joan Crawford, but for some reason, whenever I see a movie whose plot revolves around World War II, I turn away. However, I am always pleasantly surprised by the films when I actually force myself to watch them; this one is no different.Joan Crawford and Fred MacMurray star as two American spies on their honeymoon travelling through a war-torn Europe sending messages and enjoying the sights. The entire thing is an adventure to them which gets their toes tingling and blood boiling so the movie has an exciting tone throughout. There are also plenty of twists and turns which leave you guessing.Crawford and MacMurray work well together and balance well. Neither stand out too strongly, which is amazing since Crawford is so present in her films. This is not an insult to her; this is a compliment to MacMurray who holds his own against such a bright star."
4,"Excellent story, great acting, well directed","Based on the novel of the same name by Helen MacInnes, the movie was released at the start of the Second World War. It is well directed, well paced, and has some of the best actors of the time!! An excellent suspense/spy drama. It has some patriotic overtones, but that doesn't detract from the story. Instead it lends a certain realism to the whole production. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and if you love reading Helen MacInnes, this is a must! And unlike some adaptations, this movie is fairly true to the original novel. WONDERFUL MOVIE!!"
4,Quite good...,"Believe me, there's a lot more to this album than Come On Eileen. Although there are a number of less-than-impressive songs, the majority of the album is absolutely scorching, with great tracks like Plan B and Until I Believe In My Soul. The bonus cuts are for the most part non-essential (although some of the live stuff is pretty good), but as a whole the album is well worth owning."
3,"again, searching out third world darkness","This is an eclectic collection of essays, from a long piece on his research for his novel Guerillas to a brilliant literary essay on reading novels and seeking a sense of wonder. They vary in quality, from a far too long impressionsitic piece on Trinidad to the essay on Argentina.While it doesn't hold together well, Naipal's point of view was always valuable in these early days, when he was becoming world famous. So this is worth reading, as it reflects the preceptiveness of a novelist at his prime, before he descended into his later curmugeon role who complains excessively of smells etc. Of particular interest in his essay on the genisis of A Bend in the River, argubly one of the best and most original novels of the 20C."
1,Koon Chun Plum Sauce,Nasty. We've been trying to find something like the plum sauce that comes with egg rolls. This isn't it.
5,Sweet Harp,"Patrick Ball brings a whole new dimension to harp music. His Harp is so sweet, and he brings the spirit of Turlough O'Carolan to life.I have bought all his music."
3,Aluminum Tailgate Handle Assembly by All Sales.,"The quality of the aluminum and polished is very good, the problem is you have to take apart (dismantle) your old tailgate handle assembly to reuse half of the assembly to put it together and in my case half of the hardware was missing, so I had to improvise and find a welding rod from work and other part to put it together!"
4,Not bad at all,"The phone is actually pretty good for the price. (At first I was a little skeptical.) Everyone knows that there are pros and cons for just about anything. Some of the cons for the phone would be the static (which is minor if the phone is charged), and the fact that it is incompatible with Caller ID. (but who needs the extra expense anyway?). The pros would be the different ringers, the fun color, the fact that you can use headphones, the any-key answer, the pre-set speed dials, and the pager. (I really like the pager because it beeps until you find it-or at least for a couple of minutes- when most phones usually stop after a few beeps). I have even taken this phone into the backyard without extra static. So, if you are looking for a decent phone for a good price then this one's for you (works especially good for a teenage or college student)"
2,Not your ideal phone,"I purchased this same model (purple colour) a few months ago at a KMart store. The flashy colours attracted me, I suppose. In the beginning it was an okay phone. I had replaced a very cheap and old cordless phone, and the sound was much better. My only problem was I had to adjust to the lack of echo. :) The Antenna on the base of this phone is Horrible! My kids pulled it out and broke the plastic the first day I got it. Then, the phone rapidly began to have problems. The battery had a very short life. Instead of just beeping when the battery was low, I would get a very loud interference type noise, and the phone would disconnect me. The ringer no longer works 100% of the time, and that brings me here to Amazon in search for a better phone! I would not recommend this phone, unless you are just in it for the ""nifty colours."""
2,VTech Static machine,"I bought the phone for its price and color. I am pleased with those things. As far as acutally using the phone goes it leave a bit to be desired. The phone has tons of static in the background which often makes hearing people difficult. turning the volume up simply turns the static up, leaving the other persons voice at nearly the same volume which doesnt really help hearing... if you buy this phone, get used to yelling and saying ""what? i cant hear you! what? you want dinner with Charo? what??"""
3,"It's a cute, compact phone, but....","It's a cute phone, with the color, and everything, but it doesn't have great clarity. First of all, while it is compact, and easy to hold, the outer casing is plastic, and makes you believe that if you drop it, it might break. It seems to be very delicate. It's cool cuz it has a volume selection thing, so you can turn up or turn down the volume. For this price, i really wouldn't recommend it. ... But if you want a high performance phone, go with Sony. Not with this one."
1,Last Time I purchase a phone because it matches my sheets!,"Don't get me wrong, I thoroughly enjoy many of V-Tech's electronics, however, in this case, not even the cool colors can overcome it's lousy reception. The phone works well as far as not cutting out when it is in use, however in the background I would have to deal with a high pitch, fuzzy noise. Everytime I talked or breathed, there was a nylon-on-nylon noise eminating from the earpiece. I guess that is what I get for expecting quality from a [price] phone that matches my bed sheets."
2,Probably too late to buy this phone.,I bought this phone a while back and it worked well for a short period of time.
3,handset is too small,"I love this phone, but the handset is too small to prop between my head and my shoulder. If you plan on talking completely hands free, choose another phone."
1,I agree with Loring Cook - what's that NOISE?!??,"I got the high pitched buzzing noise too. Mine's going back to the store from whence it came! Sure the color's cool, but..."
4,Best account of Haight Ashbury in the '60's,This is the best account of Haight Ashbury in the 1960's that I have read. Brings back a lot of memories of that time.
1,The Haight Ashbury,"A lame ""history"" concentrating on a few famous characters. Boring reciting of facts with no sense of the excitement, the feeling that ""we can change the world"", no emotions of the sheer joy of being alive at such a time. Was it misguided? Was it without a deep philosophy and not well thought out? Was it more fun than anyone ever thought possible? Yes, yes, and yes.I was there. Perry wasn't and it shows."
2,Another lame attempt,"Licona tries - he really does. But he fails, because it's impossible to prove blind faith. Unluckily, Licona comes across as almost as idiotic as James Patrick Holding. Luckily, he comes across only ALMOST as idiotic as Holding. Reading a book like this one may raise the question as to whether or not Christianity really is dead, as there seems to be no intelligent defense of the religion."
4,you have to have it,"You simply have to have it if you have one of the porter cable circular saws. My complaints are (1) it doesn't have any measurements marked (2) the tightening screw is hard to adjust.Also, it makes more sense to simply include the rip guide in the saw kit instead of having it as an accesory. Actually, there's a groove on the inside cover of the carrying case, that fits the rip guide perfectly."
1,Will Not Last,"I owned and utilized this product on a PC circular saw for over 2 years. The metal is cheaply made as well as the set screws. The metal will bend when you attempt to tightened the screws enough so they will not vibrate loose. Eventually, one of the set screws broke while in the saw's shoe--causing more of a nightmare. Lastly, the guide isn't even marked with measurements--as with DeWalt's. DeWalt, incidently, provides a guide that has a much wider rod."
4,Rip guide ripoff,"The product came as scheduled in good shape. The product consists of two pieces of stamped out steel spot welded together and painted. It probably cost $1.00 to make, if that. My cost was about $25, including shipping -- that's a ripoff."
5,Great addition to the saw,"This is a great fence. Much better than the skimpy fences for most saws. It is large enough to give you a good ""lead-in"" to the work and stiff enough to provide a good work edge. I have an older one that is straight, the newer ones look like the toe ahd heel are bent (someone probably complained). I would bend the fence straight again to give a good edge."
4,It is good but...,"It is good but the one I have does not look like the one pictured. Also, in response to an earlier rating, how did you get yours to fit in the saw case?"
4,A love story,"Mademoiselle Chambon is a little jewel. The photography is superb. The shots of Sandrine Kiberlain playing the violin, the arc of her arm, the position of her head, are like a 17th century painting. The shots of the Vincent Lindon's expression as he discovers a new perspective in life, in art, in music, are wonderful. The photos of interiors, outdoors, near the sea, in the garden, are enchanting. You understand the transformation of both characters. You don't want them to go there, but at the same time, you see the futility of trying to stop them. Both actors are incredibly good. You want to hold them and comfort them. Vincent Lindon is the perfect everyday, hard working man. He is not looking for anything, but that ""anything"" finds him and he is helpless to control it. I loved this movie and recommend it hightly."
5,"More than just ""cute"".","Alot of people are dismissing Ai Yori Aoshi as just another Oh My Goddess or Love Hina. They couldn't be more wrong. While both are well known romantic comedies, they lack something at their core that fills this series...a sense that their is something real to it.There is a genuine warmth to Kaoru, and to Aoi as well. This disc provides them with yet another obstacle to overcome; a stuck up rich girl named Mayu. Mayu knows Kaoru from some time before, and is carrying a crush on him. And while she is outwardly obnoxious, it is to hide a deep fear of abandonment.Meanwhile, Kaoru must continue to hide his relationship with Aoi to prevent a scandal within her family.Add to that the financial woes of trying to earn enough money to find a birthday present for Aoi, leading to yet more miscommunication, and you have more than just a romantic comedy. There is real drama here, and through it all, there is real hope for the two lovers to come together."
1,don't buy make your own,"For Hummingbirds: boil, on stove or microwave, 4 C water, 1 cup sugar.Sugar water is all your hummers need. Do not waste your money on this product."
2,populism,I read this book along with many others ab communist Russia and its transition and it seems that it is quite populist item that puts too much emhasis on describing for example the Soviet alcoholic workers and too few on detailed objective data.
3,I love Kaley Cuoco,"I have been watching a lot of terrible horror movies lately, so I was hoping for something better here. The movie is ok. The budget appears to be larger than the movies I have been renting.I love Kaley Cuoco from the Big Bang Theory TV show and she doesn't disappoint here. The setting of North Dakota and the cast were all good. You won't be disappointed, but it isn't anything special."
1,Crap!!!,What's wrong with you people? This movie is pure crap. It's NOT worth the money and NOT worth the time.
4,not bad!,"i purely brought this movie because of Paul Wesley, but it actually was a good movie, it was a bit stupid at times but what comedy/horror film isn't. a must see."
1,Horrible Movie,"This movie was awful! The plot was horrible, it lost my attention quickly, stop and go movie, tons of bad language, horrible acting...not worth your time!!!"
3,Average killer movie,"It looks like other reviewers here are probably involved with the film. I am not; I just watched it. This movie is the average slasher fare with a reality show spin on it. Even though the storyline is not so original, I still found the movie likeable all the way to the end. It has the cheesiness but doesn't look cheap, some humor, decent kill scenes, and good music scores. Slasher movie fans would particularly find this film entertaining."
3,Killer Movie,"Killer MovieTypical horror/slasher movie. Fast paced and full of blood and gore. Paul Wesley made it all worth watching though.Story line was a bit predictable but still a couple of twists in the end. Enjoyable.Interviews with the cast (especially Paul Wesley), were the highlight."
5,JVC Bluetooth Adapter KS-BTA200,"Well, it is just the item I needed for my car.It is very easy to install and can operate in a minute.This item works fine and I had no problem with it in the last month.My thanks to - JVC, Amazon and Barneys."
4,"GOOD ITEM, BUT SOME LITTLE EXPENSIVE",I AM USING THE KS BTA-200 WITH KD G-340 HEAD UNIT AND KS PD-100 IPOD ADAPTER. ALL OF THEM WORK IN HARMONY. I WISHED TO PURCHASE AN UPPER MODEL OF JVC WHICH CONSIST OF ALL THE FEATURES I NEED AT ONCE A TIME BUT CUSTOMS RULES MAKE ME DO IT LIKE THAT. THE BLUETOOTH ADAPTER WORKS FINE BUT I THINK IT'S A LITTLE EXPENSIVE. THANKS TO JVC AND AMAZON.COM....
3,It's not the greatest bluetooth adapter,"it handles calls as any bluetooth device does with the least sound clarity, however if you can avoid this item do so by all means. try to purchase a stereo with built-in bluetooth adapter."
5,Good Product,Very good product easy to install. Works very well. The controls on the stereo make using the device a little complicated but that has nothing to do with the adapter.
5,Bluetooth adaptor by my JVC HD radio with Microphone,This system is great the sound is perfect on my radio so may functions it would take me a week to tell you about them. Just by it. I am very happy.
1,not enough info,"this product is really easy to install in your car audio/video system , but the manufacturer doesn't provide enough info about what kind of cell phones you can pairing or not with the device. I own a Samsung phone , it's really hard to pairing almost imposible , but with the Motorola phone is easy even when the sound isn't perfect , the connectivity between the 2 devices is fast . The owners manual has to much technical terminology .Pro-installation may be recommended."
3,Bluetooth is good to my work,"It have the same function as a handsfree but i can make calls from my car audio system, its good."
2,"Servicable for phone use, terrible for music","If you were hoping to pair your iPhone to your JVC stereo and stream music to the system via Bluetooth stereo, you will be disappointed. My experience has been that stereo Bluetooth through this device is intermittent under all conditions, whether this unit is 6 feet or 6 inches from the phone. Music will play for less than a minute before it starts randomly cutting out and ""hiccuping."""
1,Terrible sound quality with iPhone,"I installed this product for use with my iPhone and it failed to perform up to standards on the first try. When using it to listen to audio, the music would ""skip"" at least every minute or two and sometimes skip for up to 30 seconds continuously. The phone quality was very poor; I could hear the other person just fine, but they complained of lots of background noise (there was no echo, so it wasn't a placement problem). Installation and set-up were easy, and it was convenient and easy to use, but the audio quality was intolerable, so I would not recommend this product."
2,hard to catch,"My boys enjoyed throwing the football, but had trouble catching the ball w/out reseting the button. I would have been better off getting a regular football."
3,Works okay,"I'm the mom. I didn't actually play with the product. My husband and boys (4 & 6 year olds) played with it. My husband said it wasn't very accurate. The boys got it for Christmas and don't seem very interested in playing with it -- but they are more interested in baseball and soccer which may be the issue.After the first time playing with it, the paint/logo is peeling off the football. I have to say that concerns me with all of the recalls from China regarding lead paint. My 4-year old still likes to put things in his mouth sometimes. Hopefully, he won't be eating the football! :-)If your kids love football, they might get more use out of it. But I wouldn't recommend paying the extra money for the yardage info."
3,Eh,"3 Stars because I'm going to hang it up. BUT......It looks much cooler on the computer. You could print the picture, buy a frame, cut out a square in some construction paper, and voila - you have this thing. The cool thing about doing it yourself is: you can get a couple more frames, buy a bunch of construction paper, print up some different albums and have a whole set. Funny thing, somebody signed a certificate of authenticity (or something like that) as if the framing was a work of art. I'm sure there are easier things than framing pictures, but I don't think I'll be saving this thing for the Smithsonian."
4,lo-fi pavement emulators,"i really enjoy this little-known jewel.evan dando provides the glue and seems surprisingly un-self-conscious on his few vocals. ""special plan"" is an unknown classic !"
3,SMALLER THAN EXPECTED,"I FOUND THIS TOY TO BE VERY DURABLE FOR A 14 MONTH OLD BOY - I HAD THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BIGGER - MY FAULT. I DIDN'T LOOK AT THE MEASURMENTS.MY SON HAS HAD THIS TOY NOW FOR 3 MONTHS NOW - HE PLAYS WITH IT STILL, THOUGH NOT FOR LONG BEFORE HE GETS BORED WITH IT AND MOVES ON.OUT OF 10 STARTS - OVERALL, I WOULD RATE THIS MAGIC CUBE A 5"
5,The BIG hit,"My daughter has had this toy and the Mozart Cube since she was 6 months old, and at 4 1/2, both are still her favorites. She now sings Mozart! Sometimes she sings only the guitar part, next time, it's the french horn's part. Woah. It is so wonderful how you can pick and choose which instrument or combo to listen to, and see how each sounds differently and together. Awesome, smart toy."
3,I EXPECTED MORE,"I HAVE TO SAY I WAS A BIT DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS TOY. I HAD PURCHASED THIS FOR MY SON'S 1ST B'DAY. IT WAS SMALLER THAN ANTICAPATED - MY FAULT, DIMENSTIONS WERE GIVEN. BUT THIS RATING IS BASED ON MY SONS' INTERACTION WITH THIS TOY. THOUGH IT IS VERY DURABLE, HE GETS BORED WITH IT FAST. WE HAVE NOW HAD IT FOR 3 MOS & IT IS ONE OF THOSE 'FORGOTTEN TOYS'. HE'LL PLAY WITH IT FOR MAYBE 10 MINUTES BEFORE IT GETS PUSHED ASIDE & HE MOVES ON TO ANOTHER TOY"
3,Fun toy but questionable quality,"My daughter loved this toy. She loved pressing the different buttons and experimenting with the different instruments. Unfortunately, on our particular cube, the flute played somewhat slower than all the other instruments, so that when you heard the instruments together, the music always sounded wrong, which drove me up a wall. I would recommend purchasing this in a store and testing the exact unit before buying."
2,"Great toy, but with a defect","Our kids loved this - so much so that when one dropped it and broke the plastic strip by the on/off button (making the toy unusable), I bought another one. Wouldn't you know the same thing happened a few weeks later? This toy is supposed to be made for small children who have been known to drop things on occasion...the manufacturer needs to correct this problem."
2,stopped working,"We received the musical cube as a gift when our baby was about 3 months old. It was wonderful at first, although she was a little young for it, but it stopped working after a few months or so. The instrument sounds just kind of went haywire and the songs were no longer playing correctly. I tried changing the batteries, but it still didn't work. It was a shame because we all really liked it and now that she is 12 months, she shows more interest in it, but it won't work. Because it was a gift and we got it so long ago, I haven't tried to contact the company, but maybe I should."
4,Very cool Musical Toy,"My daughter got both the Mozart Magic Cube and the Sing With Me Cube for Christmas this year, and we love them both! I am a music teacher, and I think these are just really cool musical toys for young children. The sound is much better than I expected, and my daughter loves them both. I give this one 4 stars instead of 5 only because the songs can be kind of hard to sing with because the music is a little elaborate. It's easier for kids to sing along with simple arrangements, and the cube's songs have lots of notes...which make them great to listen to, but maybe a little tough for a child to sing along with. NOT a reason not to buy, though! Lots of fun, and potential to be an interesting toy for a few years."
5,Awsome Block!,"My son, actually our whole family loves this. As soon as my son sees this, he smiles and laughs. My son is 6 months and he hits the buttons and starts new songs, it's great for the car seat! You can get it at walmart too, for pretty cheap. It's also nice because all the instruments are seperate, if you want, which makes it quieter."
5,Baby pleasing music,My just one year old grandaughter immediately gravitated to the music cube. She quickly knew how to make it work and enjoys the process and varity.Parents loved the fact that there is also an on & off button so it can ride quietly in baby bag on airline!
2,Great toy-while it works,"I bought this toy for my 9 month old son for Christmas. He loved it and it is a wonderful toy. However, in mid January it started to sound as if the batteries were dying and then it just quit. I replaced the batteries but to my disappointment it still wouldn't work. I tried different batteries again just to be sure and still nothing. I had a very hard time finding out how to contact imaginarium.com and finally just emailed amazon. They responded quickly and it appears that I will be able to return the toy and my son liked it enough that I may take my chances and buy it again. There are mixed reviews some saying that it is durable and works great and a few like mine."
2,They should have stopped at Testimony of the Ancients,"Yeah, yeah its technical. TOO BAD THE MUSIC JUST DOES NOT CUT IT. It seems like some metal bands lost their direction beginning around 1994. If you want to hear Pestilence, go listen to Consuming Impulse or Testimony of the Ancients. I understand that a band wants to experiment, but I sure am glad this was their last album if this was the direction they were going. I am being nice giving this album 2 stars.Personal Energy is one of the worst songs. Take me back Reduced to Ashes !!!!!!!!"
2,"Get ""Consuming Impulse"" instead","Consuming Impulse was one of the best late 80's/early 90's death metal records. Spheres was a later attempt by Pestilence to get ""progressive"" even with the addition of keyboards. Bleh. It doesn't work.Consuming Impulse is an absolute classic death metal CD. Get that one instead."
4,A very good album indeed...,"Desireless is not a well known artist, and it's quite puzzling, because she had potential. ""Franois"" is a near perfect pop album with very good melodies, as some other (a few) are more or less interesting. The bomb on this album is without a doubt ""Voyage Voyage"": an anthemic pre-dance track which was a huge hit in 1989 here. The words depicted in this album are very influenced by images of this world and beauty of the nature (""Voyage Voyage"" refers to many rivers: the Amazon, the Gange. Many races also are named. ""Hari Om Ramakrishna"" talks about deserts, insects, moon...). This album will always reminds me a lot of things and it will stay in my heart forever."
4,NICE ACTION MOVIE,VERY NICE ACTION MOVIE. GOOD STORY LINE AND ACTING. AND OFCOURSE CHRISTY CHUNG IS AS BEAUTIFUL AND STUNNING AS EVER.
3,"Buy Huey ""Piano"" Smith Instead","This album's content is almost identical to Huey ""Piano"" Smith's ""Twas the Night Before Christmas"" which is excellent. In fact, all 10 tunes from that album are on here. Although Dr. John (AKA Mac Rebennack)and Earl Palmer are listed on the cover, it is pretty tough to figure out what their contribution is here. You can find more info here [...]"
1,Not Recommended,"Bulky, drops connections, freezes repeatedly (requiring soft reset), and hard crashed once causing loss of all data. You're outta here, Springport!"
1,Other modem modules are 100% better,"After several tech support calls and changing batteries, the modem started to work only to discover that the modem was not consistant and dropped connection too often. I also had to remove it and re-insert it several times in order to reset it because the visor will not see it anymore. Needless to say tech support told me to return it and get another one.I did a much better thing, I DID return the unit which is much heavier than the Visor itself! and got a real modem for my Visor: CardAccess Wristband Thincom Portable Modem Module. This is the best modem you can buy, SKIP this Sprinport and go buy the CardAccess Thincom, the Thincom even has an extra 512K of memory for apps and data!"
3,Suffocation's Best,"I must say that this is the only Suffocation album that I can listen to in its entirety without taking a break. I found Effigy and Pierced to be very boring and annoying. But this is a good listen despite the so called poor production, I think it helped bring out their true sound. If you are thinking of buying a Suffocation CD then get this, but if you want excellent death metal then then look no further than VADER - The Ultimate Incantation, and MALEVOLENT CREATION - Retribution, 2 excellent albums every death metal fan should own."
5,A great album that deserves a fix-up real bad,"I introduced myself to Suffocation a couple of years ago and decided to grab all of their albums including this one. I understand why it went out of print. Their label Roadrunner was going through financial problems and couldn't give the band a good recording budget, so they were forced to work with a producer that didn't know how to record death metal. Remember that this was the early 90's, and engineers like Scott Burns were a hot commodity at the time when it came to death metal albums. The music is unbelievable, don't get me wrong. If it wasn't for the bad production quality, this could easily be top-notch. I could see a remix/remaster possibly being valid, but seeing that Roadrunner owns the rights to the album, I doubt it."
4,Awesome Death Metal,"Breeding the Spawn has been out of print for a while. Quite a few fans seem to overlook this album, due to it's below par production. However, this weakness is more than made up for via Mike Smith's fantastic drumming and Terrance Hobbs fast technical guitar skills, though the guitar sound is quite faint in the mix.There is still plenty here for death metal fans to enjoy. There's some fantastic time changes and technicality in the music here. A lot of it is quite catchy after a few listens.Some of the tracks have been redone on other Suffocation releases.I bought my copy used. Hopefully, they'll re-issue this album with better mastering for the fans that don't have the original release (you can generally still find it used)."
5,Good,"If you're a JTC NOE fan, it's good. I collect his books so I like it . Good condition - an old book."
2,spa bathrobe,ordered the spa bathrobe. the material is very thin and i am glad to use it onl in the sumer months. i don't think the material would last a year of washing.
2,EHHH?,"Not the quality I expected from P.Cable. While it cuts, the blade has a wobble, i.e. bent so it cuts like a cheap dado. Not really wide, but as a cabinet maker it does not cut a thin cut that the Freud (spelling) blades make. It is going back to whomever..."
1,Not worth it,"I actually picked this up at my local tool store. I needed a blade to rip some plywood cleanly and the price was right. I thought that with this blade I could avoid the hassle of my corded circular saw.As I was purchasing this, the salesman raised his eyebrows and expressed some doubt about the blade. He was right.The thing ended up being virtually useless. The cuts took forever and the saw screeched like a stuck pig as I tried to push it through the plywood.To be fair, I guess it is possible that the problem resides with my particular PC cordless circular saw (it's refurbished) and that the problem is not the blade. However, given that the person I bought the blade from had expressed doubts, I think it's the blade."
3,Embryonic Westerberg?,"I bought this because Pete Searcy fronted Squirrel Bait, a great mid-80-'s band that at the time was compared to Husker Du and The Replacements. In fact, at the time, Searcy was called the best voice in rock other than Paul Westerberg (! ). Searcy's current sound is slick power pop, not unlike the Goo Goo Dools or Tal Bachman. This isn't all bad--sometimes the hooks are there and the songs work (see ""Furniture,"" ""Hateful,"" and ""Ceiling Stars""). Overall, enough good songs to make it worth buying.One major improvement would be for Pete to rasp out his voice a little, like in the old days. The ultra-polished vocal sound he goes for here detracts from the songs, which at their best really are like Westerberg, and deserve a more gritty, soulful treatment."
4,Great new artist!,"I just saw Peter live last night and he was awesome! He was opening for Blessid Union of Souls and I enjoyed him as much as the headliners. His songs are filled with poetry and soul and he's also a really nice guy. (talked to him after the show) I have been listening to the cd almost constantly since i bought it last night. I especially enjoy the tracks Invent, Broken, and Could You Please and Thank You."
4,New Play ground,I have not opened it yet as it is for a birthday coming up later in year.Please no more requests on this product. Thanks
5,Excellent Fun,We got this toy for our kids thinking that our son would be more interested than our daughter. We were wrong. Our daughter spent all Christmas Day hooking up wires to make sounds and blinking lights. It teaches in a real hands on way. I highly recommend it!
5,Exceptionally entertaining toy with educational benifits,This was a wonderful choice for my 10 year old daughter. She spends hours with it and I feel safe leaving her on her own with it - as opposed to the chemistry set she originally wanted. I highly recommend it.
4,Prety much what I expected,This is a fun toy certainly more educational that most. My 8 year old has really enjoyed doing some of the projects. The manual is fairly straight forward and easy to follow. I did have to return the first one I got because it would not work. But the second one works great.
1,Absolute piece of Junk,made of cardboard. Completely ruined on second use. I had one of these back in the 70s that was made of much better material. This item was a terrible letdown
2,Better feeder for ants and bees,"We got our feeder as a gift and initially were thrilled. It's a lovely garden ornament, but the glass globes drip nectar all over the place. Look out if it's windy! The bees and ants love it. The hummingbirds love it too, but you'll have to watch your nectar draining away on the ground. Save your money on this one."
5,Bird Lover's Artistry,"I purchased this humming bird feeder for a bird/hummingbird lover in my family last year. I have been getting rave reviews about it all year. She absolutely loves it, and the humming birds love it too. Wonderful gift, very stylish!"
3,really cute-but no business!,The Hummingbirds don't seem to like it much. They come to see and then fly off to my traditional feeder. I like it tho-is a cute addition to my garden. Cute decoration-not great for feeding birds.
2,Pretty to look at...but ours is a LEAKY MESS!!!,"We are having bad luck with the hummingbird feeder. It leaks the liquid sugar solution all over the patio. Hummingbirds like it, but not as much as the ANTS!! I will try to get a refund or exchange it...maybe ours is just a reject!"
3,"Hummers drill thru glass trying to drink, thus leaks","This is an very attractive feeder, and it only took a few days for hummingbirds to find ours. BUT the hummer that did find it drilled at it like a woodpecker trying to get to the nectar. Luckily I was watching as this happened and so was able to figure out why that globe leaked: the hummer had drilled through instead of finding the hole. This is probably why so many reviewers report leaks. The holes need to be more accessible to hummingbirds. Also, the globes would be much prettier if they were in fact all red, as pictured in the ads. If these rather major problems were fixed, this would be a great product."
2,"beautiful, but leaks like a sieve!","This product is beautiful ""ART"" addition to the back yard. The hummingbirds seem to like it, but it leaks like a sieve and has to be constantly filled! I really want to feed the hummers, not the ants. The plastic parts are also weak and break easily. Refine the good idea and you might have a winner!"
1,Junk,"Bought two units. Each of the units have 3 globes. Three of the six globes would not seal tight and leaked quite quickly. The other 3 simply leaked, albeit slower. Hummingbirds ignored it because of the small feeder holes. The mounting system is flimsy and needed pliers to adjust (easy for me, perhaps not for some people, especially elderly or those with poor eyes). Far better products available....perhaps not as visually interesting. However, if all it does is leak all over your patio or deck and the birds ignore it, then what good is it?"
3,Keep it out of the sun,"A nice mobile for hummingbirds, but the design does not work in the sun - or any place where the globes will heat up. The problem is that as the globes heat up, the air inside expands and the liquid drips out over the course of a day or two.We moved ours under a tree and solved the problem, but were very disappointed at the design flaw preventing us from hanging it near our window.Back to the simpler plastic models for that location."
2,Doesn't attract hummers,"I bought this because it was so pretty, and I found it to be quite durable. However, the hummingbirds wouldn't eat out of it! I tried everything. First I hung it up but the hummers ignored it. So I hung a standard feeder it its place and when I had a lot of hummers coming to it, I put this one back up instead. The hummers went away. I even taped yellow cut-out flowers around the feeding ports, thinking they might find them better that way. Nope. Sadly, I finally just threw it away. I didn't want to--it cost a lot and is indeed so pretty--but useless."
2,Very pretty but it leaks,"I love the look of feeder and unlike some other reviews, I did not find the feeder delicate. I love that I can just put the pieces in the dishwasher. But the biggest problem is that it continually leaks so I would never buy this type of feeder again."
2,"It's pretty and easy to clean, but...","it leaks like crazy! I've had this feeder for 3 yers now and a month after I had it hung, I noticed that the patio ground underneath was always sticky. Upon investigation I noticed that liquid was leaking out of all the ports from all the glass jars. I ordered this item from another place, but thought to share my experience here. After 3 years, I'm ready to switch to another feeder and throw this away! I wouldn't really recommend this as a hummingbird feeder, maybe as a decoration but not a functional feeder."
4,Hummingbird Feeder,"Interesting mobile hummingbird feeder that looks very nice. Was priced right and hope the local hummingbirds find it. As with all hummingbird feeders, breezes tend to slosh the nectar out of the feeder!"
3,Lovely to look at - attractive to birds,"I was concerned that the birds would not come to the feeder because of the concealed feeding holes, but I brewed my first batch of nectar a little stronger as the instructions recommended and they were feeding within an hour of putting it up. I have another feeder - a traditional one - in another part of the yard, which they prefer (it has the resting arms that the other reviewer recommends) but this is a nice alternative for the birds that are chased away from that feeder. Because of the complex structure of the mobile, I've not had any trouble with ants at all, as I do with my other one! It's also amazingly easy to clean. I've found with other feeders, the little plastic flowers eventually break off. The glass globes can even be washed in the dishwasher (but be sure to rinse them afterwards to get rid of any detergent residue that can harm birds)."
3,Good and Bad,"I bought the feeder last year because it was different from the other feeders on the market and had an ""artisy"" look about it. For the most part, it is easy to use and to keep clean. I did notice on the 85+ degree days, which fortuntely isn't too often here, a problem with the nectar dripping out of the feeders. I think its because the holes are so low on the feeder. Could be a huge mess in warmer climates. You would definately have to keep it out of direct sunlight."
1,Horrible idea!,"This is a terrible feeder that does not take into account the actual feeding habits of hummingbirds. Hummingbirds are highly inefficient fliers, and they prefer to rest frequently while feeding. This feeder offers no place for the birds to rest, and in the slightest breeze, the constant movement of the hanging globes makes it even more difficult for the birds to feed. Although it looks nice, the feeder is terrible for hummingbirds. Opus makes a different feeder that presents the birds with a ring on which to rest while feeding. That feeder should be purchased without hesitation over this ""mobile-type"" feeder. Please remember--do not add red dye to your hummingbird food! These wonderful little birds can be highly sensitive to such dyes, and you could inadvertently hurt the very creatures you are trying to attract. The red plastic is enough to attract them. Also remember to change the food every few days, especially in the heat, as the sugar will ferment."
4,My hummers love them,"When I received these feeders as a gift I was worried about the negative reviews I saw on this site. I removed my old feeders and put up the mobile and saw NO hummers for several weeks.Then, I put my ugly old Hummzingers back up and lefy the Feeder Mobile up as well. The hummers came back! To my huge surprise and delight, the hummers now love the mobile and choose to go to it more often than they do the 2 Hummzingers which allow them to perch when they feed.To make filling and carrying the glass globes easier - set the globes in a cupcake tin. Always hang the center feeder first."
2,hummingbird Feeder Mobile,Although this is a very pretty feeder and does attract hummingbirds it is very messy - leaks nectar almost constantly (and I have hanging in front of my kitchen window over the porch - so makes a big mess on the porch) The guidelines say to hang in a protected area but needs to be where the nectar will not make such a mess.
3,humming bird feeder was partially defective,"Everything shipped well and what not, but as it turned out, as my gift recipient was piecing the product together she discovered that one of the glass feeder jars was broken. We had to glue it back together. Other than the defectiveness, it really does look lovely hanging in the tree in our front yard."
4,Beautiful...but hard to put together,"This is a beautiful hummingbird feeder, once I finally got it together. It's confusing, and the instructions are terrible. Don't lose any of the parts, either!"
2,Not for sunny spot!,"This feeded does not work well at all. As soon as the sun hits it the liquid drips out. By the end of the day the balls are empty and the ants below are feasting. I tried it one time and it has been in my garage ever since. Oh, well!"
2,Functionally disappointing,"Although this feeder looks great, our hummingbirds didn't like it much, and refused to feed from it. To add insult to injury, two of the globes leaked."
3,No replacement containers,I've had this feeder for about 2 years. The hummers have no trouble finding the ports and drinking the nectar. I also think the little wire circle hangers on the 3 glass containers are rather flimsy & cheap for the price--and they rust. It does look pretty hanging from my dwarf magnolia. Biggest problem: One of my containers fell during high winds and shattered & I can't find a replacement. Any site that sells the feeder should also sell replacement containers as it doesn't look near as pretty with only 2 hangers.
1,Art over functionality,"This product is lovely to look at but as soon as the wind blows all the liquid spills over the edges. Good for attracting bees, hornets and yellow jackets but nothing more."
2,big tub hides LITTLE content,"This was horrible...You get the illusion you're getting this TUB of legos and instead you get 2 tiny baggies of legos sitting at bottom. I don't even think they go up to the beginnng of that yellow sticker from bottom. And, of course, as they know, it's NOT worth the S&P cost for me to send back. It makes me think twice about buying on-line."
2,Useless,"I was watching TV in my sisters room when i realized i needed to change my pad. The only pads she had were these always ultra thin regular pads with flexi-wings. These pads were SO uncomfortable. Not only did it feel like i was wearing the biggest baby diaper on the market but it the material of the wings and the end of sides of the pad were digging in to my skin. Finally after about a half an hour, it started to scrunch up and lose shape so it was less painful. I don't reccomend this product. You are better off using Stayfree of Kotex."
2,Inexpensive product but poor sound,"My old Sony broke so I purchased this one after reading several reviews. Quite frankly, the sound is surprisingly poor. Even my 5 year old Sony sounds better than this.1. Hiss: Listen to the radio and you will get this when the volume is turned on above 3. 2. Bass: It has XBS, but once you turn it on, 'bass' is going to dominate the music. 3. Clarity: For instrumental music such as jazz or classical, this does a decent job. However, when listening to vocal music, the high octaves sound as if someone recorded it using a very dull microphone.All in all, a very disappointing purchase. I think you could spend your [price]on something else."
5,Excellent Product! Excellent Price! A+++++,"This unit is an excellent buy. It provides great sound quality and has fantastic features such as: one AA battery operation, 33 hours of playback, 20 Key Presets, an Extra bass system, Auto Reverse and a very appealing compact and slim design. This is the smallest and thinnest walkman, I've ever purchased. The unit is so light you won't believe it. I love the large LCD screen and unique design. I've purchased high-end walkmans which cost twice the price and this unit is easily comparable."
2,"Appears good, but...","I like the compact size and the fact that it performs for a long time on 1 AA battery. But the sound is not that great, and occasionally flickers in and out, which could be the headphones, but they are the ones that came with the unit. My main reason for purchasing a walkman was to listen to the radio on my train ride to work, but the reception outside of NYC is terrible, there isn't even any fuzz, just silence. I have only had this player for 2 months, and just recently when I try to change the band from FM to AM the LCD screen goes blank, and all the stations I programmed into the memory disappear. Very annoying. I am considering sending it back to Panasonic, but that is usually more trouble than its worth. Stick with 2 AA batteries and maybe you will get hear something."
4,Great for Close FM & Books on Tape,"I use this unit to listen to books on tape at the gym. Get new headphones because these aren't the greatest, but otherwise I would recommend this product. It's fairly lightweight, easy to use, easy on batteries and quick to understand. My Sony and Aiwa were disappointments compared to this model. I would buy again."
1,Bad Quality,This birdfeeder was not built with quality materials. The feeder is all plastic and the squirrels & birds destroyed the feeder within 3 months. I had to tape most of the holes to keep the feed in because the plastic caps broke off then the bottom of the feeder cracked and fell off. I would not recommend buying this feeder.
5,Super bird feeder,"I just love this super bird feeder. It replaced all my other feeders except for my suet holder.The price was the best I could find, the product qualitity is outstanding and it is super easy to fill. The anti squirel features work."
5,Hours of viewing pleasure!,"I recently ordered this birdfeeder for myself and enjoyed it so much, I placed a second order for my sister so she could also enjoy the sight and sounds of the birds. I have had hours of joy watching chickadees, goldfinches, house finches, purple finches, titmice, cardinals, sparrows, mourning doves and even a few pigeons who have tried to figure out how to land on the tray. It does my heart good to listen to their beautiful songs and see the juveniles flap their wings hoping for a parent to feed them. It holds enough food that I don't have to go out every day and refill the feeder which is a plus for me. I put black oil sunflower seeds in two of the tubes and niger thistle in the third tube. It is easy to fill and easy to install. You will love it!"
5,Sellers response,Product arrived damaged but when I contacted the seller they immediately replaced the product at their expense
2,Not squirrel proof,Maybe we have smarter than average squirrels. The problem is that the shiny silver dome is made of plastic (not metal). So our squirrels just chewed right through it in the first week and got to the bird seed from the top.
2,Flip port feeding stations,I bought this feeder because it fed numerous birds at one. That was until the lovely squirrels found it. They chewed off the flip port feed stations and now I can't use the feeder at all
2,"Great Concert, Poor Sound","When I saw that Cherry Red Records was going going to issue Volunteer Jam III and IV, I was very excited! I picked this up the LP several years ago and really enjoyed it. The orginal vinyl album had great sound. Unfortunately, Cherry Red cut corners on this release. Far from remastering this album from the orginal tapes- they just ripped it from a vinyl record (and a poor quality record at that!)and threw it on the CD. I swear, if you listen hard enough, you can hear the needle skip and pop. Compare this to Wounded Bird Records,which has just released Grinder Switch's Redwing album, remastered from the tapes with great sound. It's a shame that Cherry Red cheaped out on this release- what other concert has CDB, Willie Nelson, Grinder Switch, Winter Brothers Band and part of Wet Willie? This release could have been so much more."
4,A New Direction,Anyone familiar with LaBounty's earlier works will find this album to be a new direction lyrically. Where the earlier albums were dark and desperate in tone this album is more hopeful and joyous but with the same hook laden pop melodies that characterize Bill LaBounty tunes. A recommended album but if you can persuade Amazon to find and sell you the Japanese import on Dreamsville Records (YDCD-0013) you will be rewarded with 4 tracks not on the American release.
5,"Ooh, I just couldn't wait for this book!","Well, it finally was released. I was so excited to see that this book was on the way and I certainly haven't been disappointed. I just love all the decorating ideas in this book - my husband grabbed it and off he went to the store to buy the stuff it recommends. Sure was beautiful when he was done. This book makes decorating elegantly so very beautiful for the holidays, and it just gives you so many nice ideas. But, the RECIPES! Yikes! Better buy those elastic waisted pants because you'll need them after these awesome dishes. You know it's bad when you want to start with the first recipe and just make everything else afterwards. That's how it is with this book. It's really that good! You won't be disappointed with this book. I just love it!"
4,Second time owner,Second time owner of this light and have never experienced any problems. I prefer hard wired lamps over the cigarette lighter type.
3,No red lens anymore,"Product description and even the box itself says it comes with a red lens. The first one I received did not have one, the second one after I returned the first did not have one. Amazon refunded me 50% and let me keep one of them, also said they would change the product description.Have not wired in the light yet, but it looks good."
3,Misleading product description,"Description clearly states ""Connects to cigarette lighter/12-Volt port."" It does not. This is the second one I have received and it can only be permanently mounted. 3 stars for the misleading description, the product however seems good. I'll update review once I get it mounted and wired."
1,What a disaster!!!,Well Amazon really dumped on me with this item... really first time I think Amazon is guilty of falsifying information. THERE IS NO CIGARETTE LIGHTER ATTACHMENT even though it says twice in the material that it connects via cigarette lighter. Was supposed to be a Christmas present for my wife... thanks a lot Amazon! Very disgusted. I guess I should have read the reviews!!!
4,Glad I found it !,Glad I found this light - My navigating days by flashlight are over - No struggling with the plug in (cigarette lighter) type falling out all of the time!
5,Hella Reading Light,"Hella always makes extremely functional high quality products. I recommend any Hella product, especially there driving lights."
2,Try them before you buy them!,"I'm a huge fan of the Pria line, but these are not like the others - they are heavier and a little grainy. I don't hate them, but will not buy them again. The flavor is pretty good though, just not what I was expecting. I highly recommend the Pria 110 calorie line - the vanilla is my favorite but the peanut butter and others are close behind.Thanks"
1,Check the date,"I love these bars, they are high in protien, and are good supplements, How ever The 3 boxes I got were all expired. Beware of sale items on bars like this."
1,Hummingbird Food,I did not received the 24oz can of the red hummingbird food that was shown on the web site. I instead received 6 packages of hummingbird food for the same price. I have used the food but I do not like it and my hummingbirds do not like it either. I have very picky birds.
1,"False advertising, would not do business with them again","FALSE ADVERTISING: The ad for this product said ""case of 6"" so when I received only 1 can of Hummingbird food I contracted the vendor who said I misunderstood! I still don't understand what I misunderstood when the ad clearly stated ""case of 6"". Although they offered to refund my money I would not do business with them again. They should have honored my purchase and changed their ad so they wouldn't have misunderstandings in the future."
4,A Eclectic and Entertaining Jazz Set,"I found Rusty Cloud & Jim Clouse's Riverscapes to be a very adventurous, imaginative and diverse recording. The set's eclecticism is balanced by programmatic ""river"" references that work quite well. My favorite tracks included ""Wind and Flood"", a fiery fusion burner, and ""Rive Macabre"", a 17-minute (trust me, it flies by) tour de force that put me in mind of '60's-era Wayne Shorter. I especially got a kick out of ""Bolden's Ghost"", which conjures the spirit of the legendary, unrecorded New Orleans cornetist Buddy Bolden. For those of you who heard Wynton Marsalis' speculations on Bolden on PBS, let's just say this's a slightly different take that persuasively depicts the seeds of all jazz, up through the avant-garde, as being present in Bolden's pioneering efforts. The rest of the disc contains some shorter, radio-friendly fare that will surely win it a wide audience. I wish more albums with an eye to the marketplace were this adventurous."
3,Sturdy flat pouches but with terrible rubber/plastic odor,"I bought this when I was looking for sturdy puncture-proof bag to carry sharper tools in. The zippers open and close smoothly enough and the material is waterproof and thick-tough. However, the pouches smell terrible - rubber or plastic out-gassing odors. Hoping the fumes will clear up if I let it air out a few days.These are very flat pouches. I would prefer something with sides, a box-shaped pouch. I'll look around some more and see if I can find any in the right size here on Amazon."
3,Decent bag but has some shortcommings,"Good bag for the price. I have one with some sockets in it stored on my motorcycle, and the other two holding my insurance papers, etc on my car and motorcycle. They work as intended, but the quality is slightly lacking.The zippers feel flimsy and the seams have alot of play in them. Eventually the seams will split I am sure and when that time comes I will invest a few extra dollars in a better bag. For light duty use these are perfect though.For the reviews complaining about taking the cardboard out and damaging the zippers, etc all I have to say is, holy cow.... how hard did you rip it out!? Open the zipper all the way and gently slide the piece of cardboard out.... don't act like a 3 year old on a jungle gym and beat the heck out of it."
3,Cheap and good Value,Cheap and good value. I don't have any emotional attachment to the style or zipper movement or colours.Check out the Klein tool zipper bags =PThese are cheap enough to allow all tasks to be organized. The zipper mechanism is cheap and will fail over time.
5,Master Lock NonLock Storage Bag,"These bags are super nice especially for the price. Super nice! I bought two packs of them. They come in very handy and help me to organize receipts, papers, and other documents. Very happy with this purchase."
4,Just right for what I am using it for (light-duty),"I'm using a few of these to cover up areas where my toddler does messy activities. I have one taped to the wall next to her painting easel and one on the floor under her painting easel. It's just the perfect size for that. Today I spread one out on the living room floor so we could sit on it and play with Play-Doh and not get Play-Doh in the (landlord's) carpet.It's been a really big help having these this winter because it's too cold to take the messy activities outside, and I think this has kept our toddler from going too stir-crazy this winter."
5,The mystery of life,"Larry Dossey discusses the mystery of life and how consciousness is related to all of the physical things in the world. He does a superb job in explaining the wonders of the soul. Although is work is always inspiring, this book is especially so. It tells us that everything including consciousness is connected in a convincing way. For another astonishing book with a slightly different take on the subject, I'd highly recommend ""The Ever-Transcending Spirit"" by Toru Sato. It is also a tremendously insightful book!"
5,Beating the Odds,"The book, like the author, is simply outstanding! It, and she, have the remarkable ability to cut through the superfluous baggage and garbage preventing a person from getting what they want out of any relationship. I cannot recommend it highly enough!!!"
5,A great addition to your tool collection!,"I purcahsed this saw a few months back after salivating for it for a few years now. I couldn't justify purchasing this saw when my table saw and circular saw more than do the job, but finally I got sick of using those bigger tools for small jobs and that's I finally gave in to this purchase.Now this item isn't the cheapest option available out there but by far in my eyes it's the best and worth every penny. Right out the box with the stock blade the saw does a good job on various thicknesses of wood. I haven't had the pleasure of using it on plexigass yet but I'll get there. Overall though, I definitely recommend this saw but remember this is a trim saw. You have your regular circular saw and or table saw for the big jobs. This saw is more for the small little jobs or cutting trim, etc. Enjoy!PS... My only complaint is that this tool does not come with a case. In my eyes, every power tool should come with its own case."
2,"Tough, Fragile, and Poorly Dimensioned","Tough motor and casing, but a small bump can tweak the base out of alignment. If you're wanting to use a clamped straight edge as a guide, you'll have to measure to make sure the base isn't tweaked, then you'll have to measure an offset of 1 5/16"" to one side, or 3 21/32"" on the other. Come on -- what's wrong with 1.5 or 3.5? Who the heck designed this base anyway. A mixed bag for a lot of bucks."
1,Terrible saw for the money,"I don't know who is reviewing this saw but I make my living with these tools and I purchased 2 of these based on Porter Cables reputation to replace my Makita trim saws. I live in New Jersey and these saws are filled with gear oil which in the winter means unless you heat them up, they burn themselves up trying to turn the gear oil in the cold weather. After I realized this I put light weight oil in the other one which helped but it still burnt up with a fine cut high tooth count blade due to low motor power. I don't need a trim saw to turn a rough cut rip blade, I need it to turn a trim blade which this one does not! 2 burnt up saws = bad review!"
2,Try to find the blade,I have had the saw for probably 6 or 8 years.. It is a great saw... Only one issue with it now. Take the time to try and find a 4 1/2 inch carbide blade for it. I can not get them locally and have only found a couple of places on the internet that seem to have old stock. It is easier to find a non-carbide blade... but that does not do this saw any justice for it's versatility.
5,The perfect trim saw,"I bought mine used, but it looks new and it works flawlessly. It's smaller size and less torque make it a joy to use. Don't confuse smaller with flimsy. This is just as well made, accurate, and easy to use as the big ones. It just shouts top quality. Another thing is the blades. The thin size reduces chip out, and they are cheaper."
4,"4 1/2"" trim saw",The saw is light weight and easy to use. My only complant is that the three stores that I went to that sell the saw never had replacement blades.
3,Consider other options,"While the motor and blade assembly of this tool seem to be up to Porter Cable standards, I'm disapointed in the sole plate of this saw. It is flimsy and not very accurate. So sloppy, in fact, after you adjust the depth of cut you better check to see if the sole is still square to the blade. Oh, and the set screw used to square the sole to the blade when the saw is set to max. depth of cut ... I tried to adjust it and the thing fell out in my hand. By the looks of it, PC didn't bother to thread the hole. They just forced this screw in a few turns, which means you can't back the screw out because it becomes immediately loose. Shoddy. I wish I looked more closely at some of the small cordless options that are out there now."
3,I told you so...,Just recived the Porter Cable 314 Trim Saw. Yes it's made in Mexico and yes the sole plate is not square to the blade. As to cutting preformance it does it's job. But the overriding issue for me is the country of manufacture. Why oh why did Porter Cable take one of their premier products send it outside of the US and away from the close oversight necessary to produce a quality product.
2,good but....,"I've used this saw in my shop and in the field regularly for small trim cuts, luan, 1/4"" plywood, etc. It was great for the first few years but somehow the base has warped and it does not cut accurately or square any more. It served its purpose, but for what it cost, i would think they would make the base a little stiffer or perhaps aluminum so it does not warp & lasts longer."
1,Lasted just under 24 hrs!,"My 25 lb. cocker/eskimo had this toy shredded in less than a day. Granted, she does tend to chew her toys up, but I wrongly assumed from the other reviews that this one just might last....not so!!! If your dog tends to chew up toys, this is not the toy for you!"
2,too long and too heavy for its purpose,"It is a great idea, and I like the swivel feature, but the length of the arm means that the clamp pulls up on the wooden deck rail it is attached to. I can only fill the feeder with a small amount of seed, and I have to keep the swivel set so that the feeder is in line with the deck rail, defeating the purpose of being able to swing it out away from the deck floor. It might work better on a flat metal rail."
2,not what I thought it was going to be,"I have a Stokes bird feeder pole from three years ago that I love. I thought this was the same product, but it is not. This is very loose in the holder. I had to add some shims to keep this sturdy and upright. I don't know that I would order this product again."
4,Wonderful addition for any kitchen.,"This product is utilitarian but also beautiful at the same time. We bought this pot rack to hold my Calphalon pots but it will work with any pots that you have in the kitchen. It puts them up and out of the way instead of having to stack your pots under the cabinets. It came with 8 hangers, (6 single and 2 double) and you can place these hangers anywhere you like to suit your needs."
3,It's Okay,"First, it didn't stand up to high winds which blew it down a few times, so I finally took it off and hung it from another hook attached to the house. Second, it faded--quite a bit. With that said, I still like the artistic quality of it, and it's still hanging, minus the floral attachment."
4,DESTROY THE IGNRANT ONE DESTROY,I REALLY LIKE YOUR BOOK AND I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A REPLY TO SAY THANKYOU OR SOME INFORMATOIN
1,granmarz music,thats it follow the money$$$$$ and keep producing them pu**y ar*e crunk beets yall gone and sold out like 3 6 mafia wots happened to the murder beets mane like in immortal lowlife dark fortress and al kapone the resurection sort ya stalls out boys cos this is wack all memphis seems to be doin the same some one shud take heed of this and start doin some basic murder beets like yall use to back in the sack the new samples they producing now they wack
1,Weakest Album of the Year,"Ive been hearing about this album from word of mouth on a webiste, and when I got it, It was a Huge DIssapointment, I found out it was some of the artists promoters hyping up the album on that webiste, ....For anybody reading this review, I just strongly recommend you listen to this cd somewhere , before spending your hard earned money on this Weak Garbage"
3,small birds only,"It took about 2 weeks for any birds to come to the feeder. Larger birds had no perches. Smaller birds goldfinches, house wrens, chickadee, titmouse, finally found the feeder and could cling to the wire cage. I first put the feeder under an arbor and the squirrels could reach in and get the seeds. As far as seed usage, I found sunflower seeds work the best in this feeder. If you don't put the feeder where the squirrels can reach it and use sunflower seeds if works well."
4,Artifacts CD review,"I think this is one of the best Steve Roach CDs. If you're a fan of Brian Eno's ON LAND, then you will most likely enjoy this. The sound of ARTIFACTS is mysterious, dark, ancient, murky, grumbling and ritualistic. Many deep throbbing cantus firmuses, ascending and descending thrumms, and underground winds which sound as if they're scabbing upon indigenous instruments. I think it's deeper than WESTERN SPACES."
4,A Unique Approach to an Unusual Subject,"Not a lot of people know about Solomon Spaulding and his book ""Manuscript Story,"" a romantic account of native Americans who were in fact the lost tribes of Israel, or so the story goes. The authors of this book, while sometimes a bit over-the-top in their zeal to debunk the source of the Book of Mormon nonetheless do a good job of documenting some facts and some speculations. This tome is a good one for the shelf of anyone interested in Mormon or mainstream Christian apologetics. The price is rather low and good copies can yet be found."
5,Finally!!!!!!!!! But I want even more!,"This has a few overlapping songs with ""Country Music Hall of Fame."" And some of the songs are rough in spots. But don't worry about those problems. This is essential music. If you don't like this, you don't like country music.These are all original recordings and the booklet is very informative.This is a great buy for the discount price, now lets just start praying for a ""Volume 2!"""
5,great CD,This cd was a great gift for someone that loves the oldies. I also received it quickly and in great shape. Extremely happy
1,Thiefs!,They took the payment and never delivered! I am a usual customer of Amazon but I have never seen such horrid customer service. All my other shopping items were delivered on time but no trace of the dryer stand. Tried to contact the company but no one responded.
4,Great cleanser for daily use!,"I agree with the previous reviewers that it would be nice for it to be a bit thicker because it seems like much of it ends up down the drain (from running between your fingers). However, that might be the price to pay for having a truly organic product that has the minimum # of ingredients to do the job. I feel like it does a great job cleansing my face without drying it out."
2,Kaplan disapoint once again,"Filled with generic advice, misleading information, and outdated questions, Kaplan should be avoided. Ironically, I used to be a Kaplan teacher myself and I hate the way Kaplan claims to prepare students for the test. That's why now I try to do private tutoring on my own. I would recommend that serious students buy The College Board's ""10 Real SATs"" for real practice, and may wish to look at Princeton Review's ""Cracking the SAT"", although the language used is kindergarten style."
1,so what does an actual page look like?,"I am interested in the format of the pages, and would have loved if the ""Look inside"" feature showed an actual page, not just the pages that talk about ""how to use a thesaurus."""
2,Underpowered,"Before buying a belt sander, I borrowed and friend's Bosch and rented one of these. I found the PC unit to be underpowered; when pressed on the work surface, it slows down considerably and gets hot quickly - the housing is too hot to touch! In contrast, the Bosch unit had significantly more power, making the job easier. I also disliked the PC's ergonomics - the bag sticks up between your hands and gets in the way when you're using the machine on a vertical surface. Buy a Bosch."
3,PC 3 x 21 belt sander,One of the major problems with buying tools online or mailorder is not being able to handle the tools. That really applies to this belt sander. I have used it for several years and it is a quality tool and durable to my contant abuse. The things that realy bother me are the positioning of the cord and the dust exhaust coming directly out of the top of grip and constantly getting in the way. The cord would be easy to solve if moved to the back of grip. The dust bag would be great if it had movable or adjustable exhaust ports (something like the Bosch portable planers).
3,Solid tool but nothing to write home about,"I replaced my old Craftsman belt sander after 15 years (wasn't broken, just wanted something newer and ""better"" before the old one broke at an inconvenient time) and thought P-C was the way to go without breaking the bank. Dust collection sounded cool, too, since my old unit spewed sawdust everywhere. The P-C is nice in that belt changes are easier, the variable speed control is handy, and the unit has a solid feel. It is a bit quieter than the old Craftsman. While the bag does catch some dust it's still a messy tool (I haven't hooked it up to my shop vacuum yet--I'm hoping for dramatic improvement and will update my review to 4 stars if that works well). I've been spoiled by other old tool upgrades where the new outperforms the old by soooo much, so I was underwhelmed in this case. Doesn't mean it's a bad tool, but just don't expect miracles."
2,Stay Away - It clogs,"This sander is super powerful. The adjustable speeds is very handy. The belt centering knob works perfectly, and is very convenient. Everything about this sander seemed to be perfect.Until I changed from a 40 grit to an 80 grit belt. What happens is the chute that the sand dust is fed into clogs. This causes the sander to perform poorly. So the sand never reaches the sandbag, and it dumps out onto the floor or into the belt of the sander. In order to unclog the sander, you have to remove 6 screws, take off one side of the sander, and then clean it out with a wire. What a pain. I am going to take this one back and buy a DeWalt from Amazon."
2,eating dust,"The sander itself has good power,the dust collection system on the other hand is a joke on this model.I use a sander alot holding it in a vertical position,and all your doing is eating dust.vertical"
1,Gear Broke,Used this belt sander for a few weeks but the plastic gear driving the belt broke.Don't buy!
2,Too unstable,I bought this sander and tried it on a group of pine butt jointed boards. It is too unstable. It tends to tip at the slightest opportunity towards the motor side. Even a slight pressure on the back causes a gash in your work. I spent more time removing scrapes and gashes than smoothing my work. Very frustrating. I am going to try a different brand as the others seemed to be more stable in the store and didn't tip so easily.
1,Tool Design 101,I just purchased this today (11-17-06). Junk. It's going back tomorrow. The dust bag is the size of a football and you cannot see what you're doing. They removed the 90 degree tube for the dust bag. I am pretty sure this adds to dust everywhere. I can't even hookup my vacuum to it. It tips easily causing gouges in the wood. Very difficult to operate with one hand. This is the 4th Porter Cable I have bought. Three out of 4 have been junk.Find something else.
4,Good sander,I picked one of these up in exchange for a DeWalt that died after a half hour of use. So far it lasted the afternoon. I used it to sand a workbench top.The dust collection was very good. When I finished I had a couple of pounds of dust in the bag.
4,Great to work with,"I have spent the last year working on my house, sanding the outside and building a deck in the backyard. This sander has worked great for me. The belt rides very smooth and is easy to change.I have only had one problem with the sander, other than running over the belt which really has more to do with user error. When I have used the sander with very coarse paper, 60 grit, I find that the pathway to the dust bag becomes clogged very easily. It appears that it just gets overloaded with material. Cleaning this out is a fairly involved operation. Almost the entire housing assembly has to be taken apart to clean it out.On the positive side the weight of this sander is not so great that you can't sand vertical surfaces. It worked great on the redwood panels of my house.I would highly recommend this sander for someone who needs a belt sander for home improvement projects. The construction is very sturdy and I expect to get years of service from it."
5,This is the best 3x21 on the market!,"Hands down, this takes the cake. Variable speed makes it easy to control. Fabulous power. This is everything I hoped for and more. For the homeowner or professional who wants one belt sander, this is the way to go."
1,Piece of garbage,"Received it for a Christmas gift and it sat in my shop for a year. Recently I needed it to sand a counter top I was building, so out it came from the tool cabinet. I cut the plastic bands from the box ,hooked up the dust bag ,adjusted the tracking and started sanding. In about 15 minutes the sander began to slow down and sparks were shooting from the brushes. I also was getting an electrical shock from the trigger. I check the Internet for solutions and decided to change the brushes. It destroyed 2 sets of brushes and sparks were still shooting out of the motor. This sander is a piece of crap and I think the dust collection is garbage. The entire motor housing was filled with saw dust when I was sanding. I'm really starting to doubt the quality of porter cable tools. For $200 dollars, I think their quality control should be a lot better. I think I might try a makita next time. Always try a new power tool when you get it before you put it away. Lesson learned."
3,Bev in her hottest film,"Bev D'Angelo, a favorite of mine for a long time, is at her HOTTEST when she seduces a rich man for his money. After the man's death she expects to inherit the fortune, she discovers the fortune has been bequeathed to her step son. Her seductive voice, luscious body and sweet but sexy personality makes this film a must have for any Bev fan. My only complaint was there was only one nude scene and it was brief. Also too much time is spent following around the son when it could have been following Bev around in sexy outfits."
2,Unacceptably slow delivery,"VHS tape was ordered 7/6, but did not arrive until 8/5. The expected upper limit on delivery was 8 days earlier."
1,Have to agree,"Unfortunately, I have to agree with the other reviews. I also am a Porter Cable fan but this was one of the worst tools in my collection. At the cost of $100 or more, I expected much better. The attachments don't stay on, it is noisy. And now, after moderate use, it rattles and wines. It was a good idea on the drawing board but in practice it fell short."
1,Worst Porter Cable Product Ever,"I have a lot of Porter Cable tools and have reccomended Porter Cable to a lot of people. I have their routers, circular saws (older versions), biscuit joiner, nail guns and a lot more. I bought this sander a few months after they came out. It is the worst tool ever made. They need a better design for holding the profiles. I have used it 3 times and it sanded good as long as the profile didn't fall out. I have decided to use the profiles without the vibrator. I hope someone will come up with a manual type profile sander that you can grasp easier than the little profiles. I wish I would have given it back to the manufacturer, but I have had it too long. I would not reccomend this to anyone unless you want to use the profiles manually."
1,porter cable profile sander,"An expensive mistake. Porter Cable is generally a decent quality product, but the profile sander is unusable. The paper does not stay on the profiles, regardless of gluing, etc.. It has been very frustrating to spend so much time attempting to redo a bad tool design, when you have invested $100+ in a machine that was sold to make your work easier. I'd sell it, but I don't feel right sticking it on anyone else."
1,Kit down grade,"The manufacturer has down sized the 9444VS by reducing the number of profiles from fourteen to nine as contained in the 9444 model; the original package contained the Dust Wand which is no longer within the package; and case size has been reduced (it's black now instead of gray if you care). Effectively, the 9444VS kit is now the same as the 9444 with the exception of the tool itself. I was lucky enough to purchase the last kit in the store that was not down graded.Upon taking the tool to the job site, I have been pleased with the tool's performance and versatility. The variable speed plus the lengthened stroke found in the VS model warrants the 30% increase in price over the 9444 even after the kit down grade. I was able to get into all locations by changing the profile accordingly. The resulting sanded areas did not show grit marks and therefor did not require and touch up, which was would have negated the usefulness of the tool."
2,after all these years rating is still poor,I HAVE OWNED THIS SANDER FOR ABOUT 7 YEARS AND AND HAVENT USED IT IN 6 YRS BUT STARTED TO GIVE IT ANOTHER TRY UNTIL I STARTED READING THESE REVIEWS AND THEY TRIGGERED MY MEMORY ON HOW TERRIBLE THE USE OF THIS SANDER WAS. MY REVIEWS OF THIS SANDER IS IN LINE WITH THE OTHER POOR RATINGS. THE SANDER DOES NOT HOLD THE PROFILES IN ITS HOLDER FOR LONG. BUT REST ASSURE BEFORE THEY FALL OUT THEY WILL LEAVE BLACK MARKS ON YOUR WOOD SURFACE. VERY SURPRISING COMING FROM THIS COMPANY. ALSO THE SAND PAPER WARES THROUGH IN A MATTER OF SECOND. IM NOT GOING TO EVEN TRY TO FIND THE REPLACEMANT PARTS FOR THIS SANDER AFTER THESE MEMORIES WERE BROUGHT FORTH.ANYWAY HOMEDEPOT (WHERE I BOUGHT IT FROM) DONT CARRY THE MACHINE ANYMORE. I DONT THINK PORTA CABLE EVEN MAKES IT ANYMORE. HOPE NOT!!PS. I CANT SEE HOW ANYBODY CAN GIVE THIS SANDER A RATING OVER 2 STARS!!
1,"Bruce Tainter Quincy, MA","Porter Cable is a decent quality product, I have and use a number of their products over the years and rate them as five star. I'm also a big fan but the profile sander is rather expensive, very poor to use, rather bulky, loud, and strongly recommend saving your money. Fein has a great sander and strongly suggest reading their reviews."
1,Worst tool I have ever spent money for,"I have never in my life been so disappointed with a power tool. The sandpaper will not stay on the profiles no matter how clean and dust free the profile is. The profiles will not stay in the holder. I spent more time cleaning the black rubber marks off my bookshelf trim due to the fact that the andpaper kept sliding off or wearing out within 2 minutes of installing the paper. I will never buy another porter cable product, and I have been purchasing woodworker tools for 30 years, and respected the brand name."
4,tOO NAROW,"I HAD BOUGHT THIS TOOL FOR MY GIRLFRIEND. SHE SAID THE SANDINGSTRIPS KEPT FALLING OFF, I THEN USED IT MYSELF, AND FOUND THAT THEREAL NARROW ONES DID FALL OFF, THOUGHT NOT SHOOTING LIKE ANOTHER CUSTOMER PUT IT, BUT THAT THE SANDPAPER WORE THROUGH ALMOST IMMEDIATLY. I WAS DISAPPOINTED IN THE TOOL UNTIL I HAD TO STRIP THE PAINT OFF OF MY WINDOWS AND SILS,I THEN FOUND THE TOOL WELL WORTH THE MONEY. JUST KEEP IN MIND THE FLAW IS IN THE SANDPAPER, WHEN YOU TRY TO BEND IT TOO NARROW. I WOULD RECOMEND THIS TOOL FOR SPESIFIC JOBS ONLY(REFINISHING+WINDOWS) IT CUTS DOWN ON TIME BUT DOES NOT ELIMINATE ALL HAND WORK."
1,huge mistake,This is the single most useless piece of junk porter-cable ever made. It is a complete waste of money and a huge source of frustration. I cannot believe the company made such a horrible tool. If I was porter-cable I would remove the tool from circulation to avoid completely driving away customers forever. IT DOES NOT WORK and makes more work if you try to use it. VERY VERY VERY DISSAPOINTING !!!!
1,Grab by Plug End,"Let me Agree with all the other negative reviews. And add SHAME ON PC. Now back to my title. Of all the crummy tools that I have ever bought this one takes the least prize. So of all the clunks this one goes with me to the highest point of my shop roof and whilst holding it by the plug end twirl it rapidly over my head and hope it makes orbit. If not orbit at least it's out of my shop and not taking up space, or tempting me to waste even one small piece of sand paper.I MEAN THIS THING IS J U N K!!"
1,problem with profile pads,"After useing the profile pads a few times they will not stay in the mounting attachment. I insert them in the mounting attachment,turn the sander on,and they shoot out of the attachment like a bullet. Is anyone else haveing this problem? At this time I WOULD NOT recommend this sander to anyone."
5,Works great!,"This product is terrific. I used it last summer when we were doing some construction and a bunch of flies took up residence of our house. I tried all sorts of products, but this one was by far the best. Two days ago, I came home from work to find dozens of flies in my house after some workmen apparently left the door open all day. I set this guy up and when I woke up, there were tons of dead flies stuck to the pad, which I just removed and discarded. No mess. I love this product. It is well designed and highly effective."
4,Attracts Bugs,"Works with Fly Web Glue Boards. it's a u-shaped fluorescent tube of about 5 inches long. Peel off the protection paper, slide the glue board into the slot and plug where there may be bugs and flies. Probably not for palmetto bugs, water bugs and cockroaches, tho will attract stinging bugs. Not a zapper and Mfgr suggests replacing bulb ($8.40) after one year.Necessary to clean unit after removal of glue board because some flies escape board and land within inside of plastic housing, with glue stuck to their bodies.."
1,Not a single fly caught in two weeks of use.,"We had flies breeding in our numerous houseplants and bird cage. I bought and installed this in various places in open-plan room. Near floor, near ceiling, always visible, on 24-hours per day. Nothing. I had also bought the 10-pack of glue boards in anticipation of success. Nothing. Not one fly.I gave up and bought two ""tangle-foot"" strips. Suspended them in mid-room. 20 flies caught over 4-day period and breeding cycle broken."
2,Get a 'zapper' instead,"I experienced an incredible fly invasion in August. Never happened before; I hope it never happens again.This thing works pretty well, but it was rather large for my small bathroom, gave off a creepy 'science fiction' kind of green/blue light (24-7). It looked really disgusting as the fly paper inside started collecting a lot of flies - I'm not saying it didn't work - but pulling the paper out to dispose of was difficult. I would rather 'zap' flies and sweep up the bodies than get all involved with very sticky paper full of nasty fly corpses that you can't help but touch when changing the paper insert. Yuck!!!!"
1,DOES NOT WORK,I don't suggest you buy this. Our house has at least 50 fruit flies swarming in the kitchen (with no exaggeration) and this has only caught 3 and probably out of pure bad luck for the fly. (It has been on the outlet for three days). Definitely not worth the money; don't buy it!
3,Electronic fly trap,This works well for small insects but is limited with the ability to to capture house flys - not sure if this is because of the attraction of the light or maybe the blue strips not holding the flys since the glue seems to be weaker than needed.
3,Do Not Buy unless you want a large nightlight!,"I am very disappointed with this fly trap! Have attracted two flies, lots of gnats! Would not buy again, wished I had mailed it back! It is very large nightlight!"
5,Very Good Product,"I bought my first one of these from another site but bought my second from here to save the shipping costs. I've had a problem with phorid flies and this thing works! Chemical free too! The glue boards are the best witness. If this isn't working for you then you don't have a flying insect problem. I can see pest control businesses and chemical companies hating this!I'd like to add to my original review and say the light is a temporary fix but I found a permanent fix here with this ""Invade Bio Drain gel"" product: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005G4STX0/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00Put it in the drain you think they're coming from and MAGIC! They're gone."
4,it's ok,"not trap all the flies, but after 2 month of use, it do catch some. Now i need to buy the second sticker pad."
2,not good so far,"Had at least 6 flys in kitchen, so I plugged it in overnight to find that it did not catch any flies, just a few little knatsUpdate: June 26, and only caught one fly with many flies in the house."
5,flying insect catcher,This product works wonders. I had one before and the product eliminated flying insects in a few days. I purchased a second one and obtained the same results as before. I highly recomend this product.
5,IT WORKS!,"I swatted the first few winter flies I saw buzzing through the house before realizing the problem was more serious than I supposed. It turned into an invasion. After trying a few other remedies to no avail, I ordered the fly trap, plugged it in, and it attracted the flies like a magnet. A few additional sticky boards would have been helpful/useful, but other than that, I am more than pleased with the device because it actually works."
1,Overrated,"I make alot of juice, so there are always fruit flies around it. Even a couple in the winter time. So I wanted to get rid of them but couldnt. I tried places the trap by the juicer, by the actual fruit, and the trash can. I only got 1 fly."
2,Does NOT attract fruit flies,"I bought this trap because I specifically have a problem with fruit flies, especially around my parrot cage, and was sick of paying $7 ea for the fruit fly lure traps (which DO work). It says in the product description that it attracts fruit flies. It does not.I put this trap mere feet away from my bird cage where every morning I see dozens of fruit flies in a cloud flying around the cage. Yet, close inspection shows that not a SINGLE fruit fly has been attracted to and caught in this trap. It has, however, caught probably every fungus gnat in my house.I'll give it a couple of stars because it does attract some pests however I'm very disappointed that it doesn't attract the pests for which I bought it and for which it is listed."
1,I don't recomend!,I purchased this lamp having great hopes. I turned it in last night for the first time as there was some mosquito in my bedroom. But he was just careless!!He was bitting around and i was trying to sleep with that and with the fact that this lamp has so bright light it makes a day light in the room! There is no way that you can sleep that way.It's not worth for the money at all.
2,"Fruit Flies, Maybe, Fly-Flies, Not So Much","I bought this and set it next to the trash can, but it doesn't seem to be able to lure or catch house flies -- perhaps the glue is not strong enough. It does catch fruit flies and other tiny flying things, but it's not doing the job it advertised and is not worth the money it costs."
2,Not worth the price - big design flaw,"So far I haven't caught any flies with this device. My main gripe is that since you should put it in a dark room to attract the flies to it, I wanted to put it in the kitchen at night. But in any room, you probably wouldn't want to run it all day as they recommend a darkened room. Also, you might want to conserve the bulbs for use only at optimum time (night). So WHY IS THERE NO ON/OFF SWITCH???!! This device is bigger than it looks in the picture and a little bulky so you really don't want to be having to plug it and unplug it all the time. For the price, they should have included a basic off switch. They could have included more than one glue board as well."
1,Waste of money.,I have had this trap/light on the wall for about2 weeks and It hasn't trapped ONE FLY!Meanwhile the flys are taunting us for being so dumbas to buy this thing.I contacted Pest Mall but have not received an answer.Their service was fine - arrived quickly and packagedwell and it lights up.Too bad as it just does not work.
1,Absolute garbage!,"This light came in with a defective bulb. Not burnt out. Not broken (at least not the glass). The bulb plugs in with two pins. Those pins are soldered (or crimped) to the wires on the bulb. Someone obviously was asleep at the wheel when this one was made and inspected because the leads were pulled completely out of the pins which are intact inside the socket. No way to extract them and reconnect them to the wires on the bulb. Can't replace the bulb because the pins for the original bulb are stuck in place. So basically this thing is COMPLETELY useless. Also, the internal workings of the lamp are loose apparently. I can feel them shifting around whenever I move this thing. Totally unacceptable work.This is going straight back to Amazon for a refund. I'm not giving this company a chance to send me another shoddy product."
2,Didn't really work...,"We had a TON of flys in our home and they were driving me crazy! This product had the best reviews and so I was excited about getting it and ridding my house of flys. Well after two weeks of having it in the home it has only caught 1 fly, 4 fruit flys and a moth. This is a pretty pricey fly trap to end up not working. It also is SO BIG and awkward to find a plug for. I would not recommend this to anyone."
1,Not up to its billing,"Didn't work- few bugs here and there but nothing to get excited about. We were out of town the first few days it was plugged in and my mother-in-law was checking on the house for us...her txt to us read ""bug catcher 6, fruit flies 300""...not exactly the results we'd like to see after 48 hours. Don't waste your money on this way terribly overpriced product. If you do buy it, don't buy the refill cartridges and light like we did- you may never need them!"
2,Expensive Bug traps,"Totally not satisfied for the cost! I caught more fruit flies by filling a glass of soap water with a dash of wine in one night than I did with this expensive light device in a MONTH! And I'm not exaggerating, I'm disappointed to have to say. Good luck. Save your $25 and just use a drop of an attractant and a few drops of dish detergent."
1,useless,"Was very disappointed. It sounded so good, but after a couple of weeks, all the moths and flies have completely ignored it. The moths are happily having a party less than a metre away from the trap....its like they are taunting me! I have resorted to hoovering them up every day!"
3,Very Effective,Within 10 minutes of installing this device near my house plants it caught 5 fruit flies. Also the design is attractive. I took a way 1 star because I felt the construction glue pad. This device should include at least several glue pads and they should list the web url right on the back where replacement glue pads can be ordered. Only the package mentions where to get the glue pads and packages get lost. Overall I do recommend this product.
3,"It Works, But Better Choice Available","This Fly Web Fly Trap is actually much larger than expected and did work somewhat to help control my fruit fly infestation. We tried three products side by out of desperation and here are the results after 48 hours:Terro 2500 Fruit Fly Trap; used as directed, caught 2 fruit fliesFly Web Fly Trap; large plug in light based trap with sticky pads, caught 11 fruit fliesFly Paper Strips, Fly Catcher Trap, Victor Fly Bait 4 Pack; the old standby, not attractive but effective, caught at least 32 (perhaps more)The Fly Web product performed right in the middle of the other two products we tried, but no telling how many it would have caught if it was the only product we used at that time. It also only comes with one sticky pad (which turned out not be an issue since the card was far from full), but refills are availableFly Web Glue Board 10 Pack.We are sticking (mild pun intended) with the Fly Paper Strips going forward.CFH"
3,If you use this to catch Gnats,"I suggest in conjunction with this product, place a small glass or bottle with water and a teaspoon of Apple Cider Vinegar (Apple Cider Vinegar with the must in the bottom)close to this product."
3,works ok,"After reading so many positive reviews, I went ahead and purchased 3,hoping they would work in my restaurant. They do work since the flies and gnats are attracted to the light and get stuck on the sticky paper. These lights have to be in a really dark location since it will brighten up the area. Sadly to say, I have lights on 24 hours a day - either the lights are on in the day for business hours or the security lights are on after hours. I put them in 3 different locations, 1 in the kitchen which hardly catches anything since the light is always on and 2 in the dining area. Out of the 3 only 1 location works well because the electrical socket is hidden behind some plants so it's dark. I've moved the other 2 around to different spots and it does catch a few but we have more flies flying around than on the sticky paper. I'm looking into other fly catchers."
2,Doesn't work.,"In theory, this should work amazingly. I live in a house that sits directly on the water, with eleven sliding glass doors that let bugs in constantly. In fact, I annoyingly have two flies dancing around my head as I write this.At night, if we leave a light on, we usually get about ten bugs all competing to get close to it. However, we plugged this blue light in and the bugs don't really seem to care about it.We leave it on all day and especially all night. We are careful to turn off every other light so that the bugs only flock to this light, but it's only caught a few mosquitos. Laughable really, considering the amount of flies and bugs that get inside and annoy us all day.All in all, it's been up for two weeks and I'm still swatting at these annoying flies with my electric tennis racket that I picked up at Ocean State Job Lot for five bucks."
2,Get the chrysanthemum juice instead,"By chrystanthemum juice I mean pyrethrum products such asCB-80 Extra Contact Aerosol 17 oz. DDT is not very toxic to humans, but this stuff is much less toxic, in fact less toxic than caffeine or aspirin, more potent as an insecticide, acts faster, and unlike DDT does not threaten the environment. It is a highly biodegradable natural flower extract which does not accumulate in tissues or the environment and causes no harm to mammals or birds. To me it smells like an old floral cachet, but flies seem to hate the smell, and they not only die very quickly, without spasming and buzzing on the floor, they run for the exits and stay away in droves. As an inside spray, the stuff is magic. The Fly Web Fly Trap will catch a few flies, but if you have a big enough problem to buy it in the first place it's probably too big to help you much."
1,don't waste your money,Bought based on good reviews- have lots of flies in the house and don't want to use poison or spend hours swatting and cleaning up guts. The cheap hanging fly strips work better. Don't waste your money unless you are trying to attract moths in your closet and away from your clothes.
1,Waste of Money - DON'T BUY,"Purchased this fly to get rid of fruit flies inside the house - it has been consistently on for 1 week and has NOT caught 1 fly - I had it at first in the kitchen where there are no windows, and it should work with no other light directly affecting it and I have since moved it to the hallway - nothing!!!! I have set up a DIY trap with vinegar and dishwashing soap and this has caught 6 flies in 2 days - HOW COULD THIS BE? WASTE OF MONEY - DON'T BUY!!!!"
1,Only the flypaper worked,"After reading the great reviews I purchased this to deal with a fruitfly problem in my kitchen. The Fly Trap turned out to be pretty much totally ineffective -- we set it up so it had a place as far away from natural light as possible (though during daytime our kitchen gets enough ambient light that this wasn't really possible) and left the light on all night & day for a week. The trap caught a total of 4 fruit flies which given the number of flies we had at the time was pretty much random chance. The unit was expensive, much bigger than I imagined, and didn't help me at all."
5,Smart buy,"I have indoor rabbits and they attract flies. I was skeptical about buying another fly trap that wouldn't work but after reading the reviews, I decided to give it a try. The reviews were right on. I bought this product at the same time my parents bought a different brand (one that I was going to purchase), in the first night I was able to fill the fly paper inside the unit where the other brand did not catch not one fly. On brand X, the fly would land on the unit but not go inside. I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend this product."
1,Don't waste your money or time on this...,"After reading the 40+ positive reviews and seeing pictures of peoples' success with the product; I thought this might work. I was terribly disappointed because the product wasn't cheap. The flies swarm in front of the light and never land. =[ I think I am better off swatting flies the old fashioned way with my newspaper. Definitely going to return this since I am not satisfied.*edit*I also wanted to let you folks know that it only comes with one sticky card. I thought for 30 bucks that I would get at least 2.so, i put a piece of food on a napkin and put it on the sticky card and voila! i caught two flies! lol =/"
2,$30 per fly,"This might work in a dark area like a barn. Didn't work in our house. Grandchildren came to the beach and let the flys in. Set this up. Here are my comments to our neighbors who were interested in the same issue:""Fly Web Trap in the house caught 1 fly. That is $30 per fly. It is beaten in the In House Fly Off (like that(?)) by the fly swatter, my hand and 2 types of bug spray (one of which only killed flys which were first rendered unconcious by a newspaper), and Windex. ... Amazon is getting a review on this ...The Fly Web Trap just hopes they will die laughing watching your electric bill go up.""p.s. It is a lot bigger than you might think."
2,It is not catching mosquitos,"I used it inside the house for bedroom for several weeks. I followed the instructions such that there is no competing light source, etc. Still it has not caught one single mosquito. It catches few very small flying bugs. However, it did not catch any of the mosquitos in the room."
3,Didn't catch vry many flies!,I would have returned this but I dropped it and broke the bulb. It din't catch very many flies and I didn't feel like it was worth the money.
5,Great product for catching bugs!,"This is a great little tool. I have fruit flies, don't know where they're coming from but I got this product today, plugged it in and it has attracted about 20 flies already.I'm going to order some replacement tape for it. Only suggestion, I wish there was a rotating plug-in, it's too large to plug into an outlet under my cupboards. If it hada rotating plug, you could plug it in sideways."
3,Still Waiting....,"We've had an exceptionally mild winter and a few weeks ago we were invaded by house flies, UCK. I thought I would give thie Fly Web Fly Trap a try. I don't know if it will actually catch flies..but it's easy to set up, and makes a great night light on our stairway up from the living room. The flies have slowed down, we had a few nights of well below freezing, so we will see if they will get caught when it moderates again.Not sure I'd recommend it, as so far it's caught no flies for us."
2,"Not very effective, but might depend on your flies","The flies in our area must be smarter than your average flies. We were trying everything to control them (we live in an area with a lot of livestock). Although it did catch some, most of the flies avoided it so we really didn't see a decrease in the number of flies in our house."
1,Never Recieved this item,I can't give you a review I never recieved this item but I gotten my money back.
3,Historical and down to earth,"This book gives a good appreciation of the evolution of the use of Qabala. It is simple, down to earth and gives alot of quotes and examples. Obviously it is serious work. Over all, it is without too much pretention."
3,A neglected subject...,I've read a few books that have mentioned (in passing) a possible Greek origin for some of the elements of Jewish Qabalah. Unfortunately they never went into detail to provide evidence for such a theory. This book however explores the issue in detail and proves very convincing.
3,Misleading,"I bought this and it is a nice bell. Has a loud ring. The description says it is a 3 1/2"" dia. It is actually a 2 1/4"" dia. and about 4"" tall. The handle is short and thin at about 1 1/2"". It is a nice bell, but I did expect it to be slightly larger."
5,Moderm form of rosary for none Catholics,"I personally love this book and will always buy some, when mine fall a part from to much use. I think this good because it give honor to Our lady, but not as much as the roman catholic would. Also has other made up different forms of the rosay so you do not have to do same four over and over again. I am trouble by some claiming this is not episcopalian when it clearly is anglican in natural sense, but more high church."
2,tis a catholic rosary,just received this booklet. I have prayed the Catholic rosary for about 20 some years butwanted to learn the episcopal/anglican way. this book is not that---it is a booklet on the CATHOLICrosary [nothing against catholicism] and do not appreciate being misled--or so it seems--by thetitle.
1,"Very disappointed, not at all what I was expecting","This book should actually be titled ""The Rosary for Catholics"". I suppose I should've been clued in by the fact that the rosary pictured on the cover of the book is a Catholic rosary, not an Episcopal rosary. It goes into good explanations of the prayers (including the Hail Mary) that Catholics use, and how to pray the mysteries. But there's nothing here for an Episcopal that wants to learn to use EPISCOPAL prayer beads and wasn't comfortable with the prayers of the Marian rosary to start with. I thought about trying to return this, but with shipping I'd almost end up losing money on it, so I guess I'll put it on eBay. I'd been so looking forward to getting this book, thinking I'd learn more about the Episcopal prayer beads, and I'm so very disappointed!"
4,Simple and practical,"I enjoyed reading this book for two reasons1) Its flows well, and easy read2) The knowledge is straightforward and practicalThe book is not very profound or earth shattering in its insights, but friendly,simply and happy in its expression of how to get and maintain and optimistic outlook on life, which you would think it should be. (but we do like to complicate things)I recommend it. It's a fast easy read that will provide some tools for keeping a smile first in your mind than on your face"
1,Naive,"I picked up this book with great expectations. I have usually found the other readers' rating system on Amazon to be quite accurate, but this book was a complete disappointment. It felt disjointed, naive and lacking in proper content to warrant a full book on the matter.Basically, the book can be boiled down to two pieces of advice on which optimism depends. These are downward comparison and controlling our inner environment. I find it hard to believe this book will be of real practical benefit to most readers. You have been warned."
3,Enjoyable enough - typical category romance from Silhouette,"An enjoyable enough read, this book is typical Silhouette Romance with no crazy hanky panky and the HEA not coming until the last few pages of the final chapter. This book works well for a sweet, uncomplicated and quick read.FROM THE BACK COVER:IF THE SLIPPER FITS...Poor Cinderellie! It was bad enough being banished to the kitchen by her social-climbing stepmother and two husband-hunting stepsisters. Now, still wearing a Cinderella costume from a previous party, she found herself face-to-face with Jack Martin, the handsome venture capitalist who'd doused cold water on her dream of opening a restaurant!Ellie Branson thought her nightmare would end when the clock struck midnight...and the party ended. But Jack showed up the very next day, bearing an offer she couldn't refuse. And thought this Cinderella knew better than to believe in fairy tales, her millionaire suitor seemed determined to prove otherwise!"
4,Modern Fairy Tale,"Fun read, a light romance just right to curl up with by the fireside on a cold night."
5,Shines,"Possibly Williams' finest play, The Glass Menagerie has all the emotion and power of Cat On A Hot Tin Roof or Streetcar Named Desire without the violence. Sadly sweet, this play is more concerned with nostalgia and the unraveling of dreams than lies and violation. It retains its poignancy throughout the three acts and evokes powerful characters and themes."
4,"Well written, but lacked redeeming theme","Readers who are looking for a fairytale, happy ending, will not find one here. It was depressing, yet the skill with which William's crafted the story demands admiration from its readers."
2,Ick,"I found this play rather dull. While Williams' use of symbolism to relate dreams is interesting, the rest of the work is not. Blaah"
2,I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND IT !!!!!!,"i am a frechman in highschool. i have read a varity of books such as A seperate peace, romeo and juliet, the odessey, and a bunch of other hard books. BUT THIS ONE I hated!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Boring...,"This book was well written by a great aithor, but the plot was boring and could have had much more excitement. I read this twice, and did not enjoy it either time. There are many other plays out there to read, do not choose this one."
1,Never even got to try it!!,"It came in a cheap plastic bag with plastic snaps. The ""switch"" assembly disintegrated taking it out of the bag, and the battery compartment is virtually inaccessible without ripping the back cover. Very disappointed. Returned it for refund immediately."
2,Don't be fooled....,"Don't be fooled. ""Progressive"" does not mean good. These guys are trying very hard to make music that is forward thinking and different, and that breaks the cliches that mire current hip-hop. For that, I give them credit. But otherwise, this album is a bust. As is often the case with progressive hip-hop, the flow is not that strong, leaning towards the spoken word style. That's not a bad thing when you're Saul Williams, Dana Bryant, Gil-Scott Heron, etc, but when you're as rusty as these guys...you get the picture. Musically it's actually pretty solid, with industrial sounding beats that are far from the awful ""bling bling"" simplicity prevalent today. But man, where is the funk? Somewhere in all this ""progressiveness"" I think it got lost. Well intentioned, but ultimately boring."
2,The Music Is Flat,"It's always good to see artists who push boundaries. However, it's always sad to see artists who push boundaries but forget to push the music. This record has it's high points, like PSA2 and Rinseflow, but in general it sounds like a bunch of mc's who can't really put an interesting rhyme or beat together, so settle for confusion. While confusion has made for some incredible hip hop records, this isn't one of them. Most of the album makes up for soul with college kid tricks. It's too bad, it seems like these guys do have talent, they just don't know how to use it."
4,Deep Hop,"Word-sound, like the mere vibration of the human voice could could usurp all yr musical sensibilities and make the backing trax to this vocal (not lyrical) onslaught seem agressive and benign at once. It's always been on the agenda of the finer hip-hop albums to mine the vein where the personal rubs up against the political, giving rise to equal measures of amazement and estrangement. But you probably haven't heard it presented in such isolationist extremes as this before and and the supreme irony of the album is that, despite the fact that it's so firmly rooted in the concept of language, it still defies description."
3,dont get carried away,"The importance with books of this sort, is dont get carried away. Islam is a big question today, and intercultural history is a top priority, but accuracy should always trump political fads. Venice is by far a city of Byzantine and Gothic, much less Islamic influence. The book fails to make this sufficiently clear, and can leave the reader with the impression that Venice, and the Renaissance had Oriental roots. This is plain wrong."
1,Not worth it,We found this and the football to be unreliable. Basically they are both junk. My kids don't even attempt to play with it. It isn't worth the effort to try to get it to work properly.
1,"Doesn't work, don't waste your time & $$","My son recently got this ball as a birthday present. First, I needed to go buy 2 ""watch-type"" batteries for the counter to work. Also, you need a pretty small screwdriver to be able to remove the screws holding the counter mechanism onto the ball.The battery cover doesn't close securely, so a medium hard bump will move the batteries, and shuts the counter off. You then need to remove the counter mechanism, and open and close the batter cover. I regret spending the $[...] for the batteries.We thought that even though the counter mechanism doesn't work, we could use it as a small soccer ball just to kick around. Even that didn't prove to be an option. There is a foam ""frame"" on top of the counter mechanism (I guess to protect the counter). But, it ends up coming off once the ball is kicked. Once that happens, the ball wobbles when it rolls over the spot with the missing foam frame.Unfortunately, this is heading right for the trash!"

1,Buyer beware..,"This tray does not fit nicely inside the tool box grill.. it is about 2 inches short on the end and about a 1/2 inch too narrow. This causes it to slide and bang around inside the grill when transported. The tools have a very ""cheap"" feel to them. The tongs were the worst.. the handles are loose and they are prety much useless. The knife won't hold an edge. The spatula and tongs are marginal. I would not recommend this item."
2,Not all that,Slim Thugs verses are good but Kyleons bring the quality down. Beats and raps don't blend all that well either.
3,first alert double sensor battery powered smoke & fire alarm,"The product is compact, however, it is very sensitive when cooking and goes off too easily. The remote shut off only works once and then you manually have to shut it with the button located on the unit. When I puchased it I thought you could always use the remote shut off, however, that is not the case."
1,Hyper-sensitivity,"This detector is promoted ""as microchip minimizes false alarms"".I am sorry to say that I am unable to use this particular detector.It went off from a crock pot, hot water running, heated microwave being opened , dryer in basement being turned on,and several times from unknown causes.I changed the battery, which did not alter the hyper-senstivity. It is brand new out of the package.The reason I got this detector is to alert me to kitchen situations, so at first it was put on the ceiling at the far end of kitchen furthest away from the stove.I changed the location to an adjacent room.There were then still alarm soundings for unknown causes, and the alarm sounded when an electric drill was used in that room.I am disappointed and frustrated that this detector is too sensitive for use in my home.I replaced this with an ionization detector of a different brand, which so far has not been set off by unknowncauses or false alarms."
1,Out of a sound sleep!!!,"Mine is less than a year old and we have had a few false alarms. Two when we were asleep. Yeah I know ... fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me. I replaced the battery to make sure that wasn't the issue and a week later our entire family was again rudely awoken.UPDATE: Two days after writing this review, the other alarm gave a false alarm just before we went to bed. We have no working alarms now. I am ordering a fire alarm for downstairs and a smoke alarm for upstairs. The dual sensor from Kidde seems to have the same problem from what I read in the reviews."
2,"Many false alarms, even after new battery","5 years old and constant false alarms even with brand new expensive lithium battery. Disturbs my neighbors and aggravates me. Why do I need this stress in my life? My advice is to stick with something simple and reliable, not this expensive high-tech junk."
2,"M-I-C.....K-E-Y, m-o-u-s-e","I bought 3 of these and within the first year, only 1 is left up. One of them sounded off early one morning for no apparent reason. I mounted them high near the ceiling so I needed a ladder to take the battery out-which means going outside to my shed for the ladder. (This is no fun if it's raining, so I now have to keep a ladder in a spare bedroom.) Then another one malfunctioned while I was out, and was blaring when I came home, scaring me again. If I lived alone it wouldn't be as bad, but my poor cat had to hear this until I got home! At 85 decibels, I do not trust these alarms to put them back up. I don't know why the 3rd alarm has not gone off like the other two. Why do they go off scaring us to death? Did they see a spec of dust? The remote control feature is another story. You can set it off but good luck stopping it! Obviously I'm not happy with them, and still looking for alarms I can rely on."
4,This thing is sensitive!,"This thing is sensitive!We have this mounted just inside our bedroom door (fairly close to the kitchen since we are in a condo) and it would sometimes activate when we were cooking even with the bedroom door closed and no visible smoke from the stove. It is annoying when it happens, but it is also good to know that it is sure to activate if there ever is real smoke or particles in the air from an actual fire.We have tried to silence it with the TV remote ""Mute"" button as advertised as a feature, but it either does not work fast enough, or does not work. I am not sure if it works or not since I don't want to spend a minute or more pointing a remote at a super loud beeping smoke detector. I usually hit mute a few times and then revert back to the standard mashing of the ""off"" button on the actual detector when it does not shut up."
1,Avoid - 3 months and I'm still waiting for a replacement from First Alert,I purchased this unit from Amazon back in January - I should have returned it to Amazon who whould have given me a refund - instead I called First Alert who told me that the sound I was hearing was an error code and the unit needed to be returned to them for testing and that they would ship me a new unit out but they were out of stock but I would get it within two weeks. It will be June in two days....I suspect they must have issues with this unit as it is out of stock everywhere and judging from the reviews they've had a lot of problems with it.
3,"Battery ""Hog""","We bought this unit because of its dual alarms (photoelectric and ionization) which detect the two fire types: smoldering and flaming. It was installed on the second floor at the top of the stairs, and was sometimes oversensitive and went off during cooking in the first-floor kitchen. Also, we had to frequently replace the 9 volt battery - about every 3 months."
2,It may be good for unoccupied spaces,"I bought 3 of these via Amazon. Unknown to me, they arrived dirty, with out of date batteries. As a result, they caused many false alarms. We weren't home for the first two, and the neighbors called the fire dept. My advice is to clean them thoroughly per the instructions and discard the batteries that come with them.They are much too sensitive. They can't be installed near the door to a bathroom in which there is a shower. They can't be installed anywhere in a kitchen. As others have pointed out, they can't be installed in a room in which the TV remote control is used. In my case, the above rules leave only the basement.In any of the above locations, a fire dept officer told me to use only photocell detectors, not ionization. They are not as sensitive."
1,Defective,"I'm preparing to dispose of my 4th smoke alarm this year. The First Alert SA302 is unreliable. False alarms are common, and I'm tired od waking in the middle of the night. I'll never buy another First Alert product."
1,Too sensitive,"We have 12' ceilings, so I thought the remote control feature would be nice... mostly use a stick now. The product is sensitive which is a good thing, but they are becoming annoying. Sometimes one push of the remote sets them off, any cooking they go off.UPDATE 2012: Most of them are hanging with the battery out or I have completely taken them off the ceiling,I would not recommend these at all!"
4,Preliminary review,"I've only had the product for a few weeks, so this review is somewhat preliminary, but the installation instructions were clear and the actual installation was simple, requiring only a drill, hammer, and screwdriver."
1,"More like 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, & 5th FALSE Alert","I bought 3 of these alarms for my familys house. Only 1 functions as it is supposed to.2 of these detectors give off frequent false alarms. I had to take them down because they kept going off for absolutely no reason (all too often while my family and I were asleep!). This is not due to any error on my part. No remote control issues, no dirty sensors, etc. I carefully read the manual and looked at posts on this site and others made by users of this item to attempt to troubleshoot the false alarms. No solutions worked.As someone who works in the field of quality control, I find a 2 out of 3 unit failure is extremely pitiful and for a company that manufactures products that people depend on for their personal safety, well, that's absolutely disgusting. I'd give this item 0 stars if I could."
4,no false alarms,"This product seems like a good modern detector. All the detectors in my home are older, so time to replace. I was concerned about false alarms, but I only had an issue with one of these early on. I have two and will probably add a third soon. The first one did have a few random alarms go off and then stop. I replaced the battery that came with the product and no problems since."
1,Daily False Alarms,"I purchased four of these smoke detectors for our home based on the rating and recommendation in a popular consumer magazine. All four have since been taken out of service because of false alarms in four separate locations of the home. I tried changing the batteries and it did not help. The sensitivity of the dual-sensors was a selling point, but evidently it was too sensitive for our home. We don't smoke, burn candles or use the fireplace, and the house hasn't burned down so I'm not sure why they kept going off. Hopefully the newer SA320CN model doesn't have the same problems, and hopefully First Alert will cover these under warranty."
1,useless,"My landlord installed this remote in our living room and we had to take it down almost immediately. It keeps being set off by our remote controls; radio controlled car, DVD player, TV. It is a horrible idea to have this triggered remotely, especially when so many remote controls are around us in our daily lives. I had no idea how many items in our house had remotes until this useless piece of equipment entered our lives. I'm actually asking my landlord to replace it, or I will end up buying a new one to replace it myself."
1,Leave it on the shelf,"We bought 4 First Alert photoelectric ionization smoke alarms and we hate them. Our tv remote sets them off, turning on the light sets them off, and the brand new batteries we installed have died after only a few months. We are so disappointed. We wish we had never seen these smoke alarms."
1,Not worth the money,"Bought four and installed them away from steam, stoves, and other triggers of false alarms. One went off every time I turned on the light. One went off any time I used a remote control. One went off any time it felt like it, which was so often we had to unplug the battery. Kept the ne that hasn't misfired and replaced the others with Kidde units that were also highly rated by Consumer Reports."
2,Poor risk buying a liquidated item.,"Alarm went off continuously after installing the battery and continued to do after many battery reinstalls and recommended vacuuming. I bought this as a liquidated item and although I paid a cheaper price, I suffered the headache of taking a poor risk. Good news is Amazon refunded my money and paid for return shipping"
2,"Great detector, too sensitive","As far as the alarm goes, it is great. But, the remote sensor function is too sensitive. It was mounted approximately 10 feet off the floor in a gabled ceiling room. When using the Dish remote, it would be parallel with the detector, or even slightly behind it, but it would still set the alarm off. And, it would even go off with the power button, not only the volume and channel buttons as designed. If they could make it so you have to point directly at it, this would be perfect."
1,Not compatible,"Unfortunately these alarms were not compatible with our central alarm system. It would have been nice if that aspect was addressed in the description as it is pretty common to have an alarm system these days. We were able to determine that immediately, so I repackaged them and returned using Amazon's return system and preprinted labels the next day, however it took weeks (over 3) to even receive an e-mail acknowledgement from Amazon that they received the return and even longer to receive a refund. Very frustrating!"
1,Absolutely the worst smoke detector ever,"Went off when the bathroom door was opened after a shower. Apparently steam and smoke are the same thing and an alarm is necessary to let you know that you should evacuate the house due to a shower. This is worse then having it go off when dinner is a little ""over done"". Complete and total junk, do not buy."
1,the review are false,why are all the review from First Alert SA302CN Double Sensor Battery-Powered Smoke and Fire Alarm (Tools & Hardware) and not from actual customers who to belive.
1,Have not received the product!,"I would like to review the smoke alarm purchased 6/24/2008. However, there is just one problem - I HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE PRODUCTS!!Please expedite delivery of our purchase of two smoke alarms #SA302CN. If there is a problem, please immediately notify me."
1,"Disappointing, quirky device","This is the most disappointing purchase I've made in the last 5 years.The main features that drew me to this product (fewer false alarms, easy to silence false alarms with an IR remote) work very poorly. The unit is wildly oversensitive. Steam from a sink or a candle are enough to set it off. The IR silence mode requires multiple attempts at very close range (so close you could instead just press the silence button).And the best of all, it emits an occasional (once per day or so) single loud chirp for no apparent reason. Just enough at 2am to wake everyone in the house! I've read the manual twice and it says nothing about such an alert. (Just to be sure I replaced the battery. No effect.)Seriously, avoid this unit. Absolutely horrible. If I could give it negative stars I would."
1,False alarms even with new battery,"Like another reviewer, after having 3 of these alarms in use for 6 months they started going off in the middle of the night. Even with replacing the batteries, the same thing happened. I'm in the market for some basic smoke detectors. I have one toddler and one on the way, so safety is very important to me."
1,Always goes off in the middle of the night,"I read on line that you need to replace your smoke alarms every ten years. My house is close to 75 years old and we are in the middle of a kitchen remodel so I bought these for the entire home.After having them in use for 3 months they started going off in the middle of the night. We replaced all the batteries and 3 months later the same thing! We gave up and returned them all and bought another brand.We have 5 kids, 3 dogs and one cat, family safety is very important to us."
1,Gave off false alarms,"This alarm unlike my other first alert alarms was givng off false alarms. It gave off three long chirps. i looked on the back of the alarm and it said if it did that to replace the alarm, so the alarm went back to amazon. Luckily, it was still within the return period. I have hard-wired ionization alarms that work well and battery operated photelectric alarms that also work well in my house. it may be that this alarm is trying to do too much with both types of sensors."
1,several false alarms,"I bought two of these thinking First Alert was a good brand, even though I had read some bad reviews on here. Each of these alarms had times when they would give false alarms. It was too much to handle so we are stuck with something we can't use and Amazon will not take them back."
2,Disappointed,"Units chirp all the time regardless if batteries are new or not. Reset button requires an extremely firm push and for a number of seconds in order to work, then only lasts a couple of days before chirping starts again. I got this kind of performance from a pair of $5 Kidde alarms."
2,Annoying goes off w/t.v. remote control,These go off when you use your tv remote control so install away from tv. Would not buy again!
3,too sensitive,"Sounds to good to be true, and it is. It was mounted in the hallway, and still was set off with a hot shower and normal baking. The remote silencing only works once. We have moved it away from the bathroom and it is working better.Not the solution we were looking for."
4,Good value,"First of all, I'd like to say how pleasurable it is to shop online here at Amazon.com. The whole buying and shipping process is always a breeze and I hardly shop anywhere else online now.I purchased and moved to a new-to-me house in November and decided to get all new smoke alarms as the old ones looked really old and were only single sensor. Double sensor alarms are now required here in Oregon, so that narrowed the field considerably. Decided on this one due to reputation, reviews, features, ease of use, and price. So far, the two I purchased seem to be working very well with only one minor glitch.I mounted one inside the master bedroom above the door and twice now it has false alarmed as I walked into the room. Mildly annoying but not a big deal. Doesn't do it for my wife, though. I guess it doesn't like me ... LOL.I am very happy with this product. Recommended. Don't forget to change the batteries."
2,Big fallout from the first,"I loved Material Girl so I was excited to buy this one for my Kindle. However, this one does not come as close to the first one. It is seriously like 2 different authors. There was no major conflict. The only conflict was solved with still a 1/4 of the book left, and it was a minor, ""hurt my feelings"" sort of conflict. Not much of a romance novel, in that way. Also, I just liked Jake better from MG better. He had more of a presence, Matt didn't really have anything special."
4,"Good, but not my favorite London book","This is the second in a three-part series. I thought it was just as good as the first book,Material Girl (Lear Family Trilogy, Book 1). Rebecca's story is a little lighter than Robin's but there are still some heavy parts. Both Rebecca and Matt have a lot of self-discovery coming and they beat each other up emotionally along the way.The dogs and Matt's secretary keep things light. I love how her dog collection keeps growing and Bean is so funny! :-)I can't wait to read the third book and see if Aaron ever gets his head out of...the dark...and gets Bonnie back."
2,Had the potential for much more....,"I loved the premise of the book, and the author clearly knows how to do humor, but I just couldn't warm up to the characters, and I didn't really believe they fell in love. They both seemed too shallow for any real depth.I think one of my problems was the junior high language that was used with a sledge-hammer throughout the book. As in: ""You are so not cool,"" or ""Oh. My. Gawd."" Both main characters, supposedly in their 30s, talk like this non-stop. A little of that thrown in for spice is fine, but a steady diet of it? It made the characters seem shallow to me.The book also went on and on. And on. It could have been edited down by 20% or so and worked much better."
1,Sleepaway Camp 2-Unhappy Campers,If anyone plans on buying this copy without the original cover...STOP!!!! tHIS IS THE WORST and most PITIFUL transfer i have ever seen. It looks like a direct transfer from a crappy video copy. Plus numerous killing seens are completly butchered and censored!! I love this film but if you are planning on buying it buy the one with the original cover of the girl with the backback. Solid widescreen transfer looks excellent and all kill scenes are fully intact!
3,Sleepaway Camp 2: Unhappy Campers,"Sequel to the 1983 cult classic ""Sleepaway Camp"". If you are not familar with the first movie it is a must see! (See my review.)This installment takes place five years after the grisly murders at Camp Arawak. We are now at Camp Rolling Hills and Angela is BACK! She has escaped from an asylum and has shown up as a camp counselor. Everything has to be ""perfect"" for her, and you will find out if you break the rules you will get punished!Lots of gore to delight the horror fan. If you liked the first movie I would highly suggest seeing this one."
3,She's Back,"This sequel to the mega disturbing Sleepaway Camp movie sees Angela back and older... and with a sex change. One by one she picks off campers. I felt it was worth seeing, and while a little cookie cutter, doesn't match up with the first film's fright factor, but overall kind of satisfying viewing."
1,*COULD NOT WATCH-VERY BAD QUALITY!*,"This might have been a good movie,however I never got to find out cause the darn dvd is junk.You can not hear the people talking in the movie but you hear the background noise.So I was very disappointed.Stay away or you might get one that is defective."
4,Different editions,"We're staging a production of ""Pirates"" in April 2002, and we have two editions of this score by G. Schirmer. The cheaper one is for the chorus, and has just the choral passages. The more expensive one (listed here) has the complete vocal music and dialogue.I have seen both, and would rate them at five stars except that the original page plates are a little dirty, introducing some confusing dots and spots."
2,not really a book,"Just so you know before you buy, this is only the chorus book. It includes only songs where one of the chorus' (pirates, daughters, or police) is singing. No solos or smaller numbers are included and neither is the script."
4,Pray Observe the Magnanimity...,"I used this score in a production of Pirates at my university, and from the standpoint of a cast member it was excellent. It outlined each part and was easy to read. At any point where scores between production years differ, this handy volume recounts them all with notes as to which part belongs with which year. My only complaints are that it is not ring-bound (regular paperback binding, harder to hold on to/use) and some harmony parts are difficult to pick out because they divide on the page turn and appear at different parts of the page. Other than that, it is a wonderful score and I would recommend it to anyone interested in producing this enchanting operetta."
3,This product and why I wasn't satisfied,It took way too long to reach my destination!I also wasn't allowed to track it! Made me kind of mad.
4,The very model of a modern libretto?,"The standard version of G&S's ""Pirates"". Most production companies will use this edition, but I've always thought that it could be improved by including a description of some of the classic stage business that has become attached to it, if only as a benchmark to improve on."
4,before you try to wed us against our wills...,"I haven't read the book, but our school is putting the play on, and it is good"
5,"First Person history ""I'm Hooked""",This first person history book is a new way of looking at the events of the past. I read the first chapter on Jefferson and was HOOKED. It was almost like reading a Larry King Interview. I felt that each person was in my living room talking directly to me.Great Book. Can't wait for the next one.
2,boring,"zzzz..I am still working my way through the book. The author, whose Malice Towards None was brilliant, takes terrific poetic license. Reading his book is like learning Plain Speaking (about Harry Truman). We later learned that the author was not even working from audio tape, just his impressions. Also, be careful reading the above reviews. Juxtaposing the abortion argument with this book is to miss the point of the buildup to the war. The abortion/civil war analogy is silly and unsupportive. Don't get caught up in it."
5,If You Plan to Read Only One Book on the Civil War . . .,". . . this is it. The rotating-narrative style pulls readers in most wonderfully. While many historical accounts take an omniscient approach -- readers stationed above the action, looking down -- this puts you in the middle of the hurricane. Perspective changes rapidly from North to South, from pro-slavery to anti-slavery to abolitionist. In my first read through, I found myself cursing Jefferson Davis under my breath (mild mannered historian that I am); when I was using it another time in preparing for a class, I found myself snarling at Abe. Having trouble connecting with people in the past? Here's your book."
3,seems ok,"I got this product bc I read online that it can help with allergies.I have been giving it to my scottie for her allergies and I can't reallytell if it has helped bc she has been on so many other supplements andmeds, but it is a great price."
3,It's just okay - more for PSB collectors/fans - nothing new,"After reading two stellar reviews for this and being a long time PSB fan, I thought this was something I HAD to have. Frankly, there aren't many new twists here - but straight forward if watered down cover versions. There are a few highlights - ""Rent"" is great because it adds some energy where the other interpretations are often flat. ""Being Boring"" is a nice remake too. This is pretty good, it's just that the Pet Shop Boys did it more stunningly lush and full over 20 years ago. I'd stick with the originals - but if you want another take on it, you won't be terribly disappointed either - it's just not 5 stars."
2,mary did you know and cd,"no cd and that was what i wanted, not the gift book. very disappointed, but didn't cost enough to fool around arguing and returning. lowery does have a masterpiece with this song and its message ."
5,"Recommendation for Christmas CD/book product ""Mary Did You Know""",This Book and CD combo arrived in excellent condition. The music is a wonderful Christmas tune that should be cherished by all I have purchased this twice and given them as gifts that are very well liked by the recipients. Thank you J KrizMary Did You Know?
5,Beautiful Christmas Hymn,"The CD was the main reason for this purchase; the recording is outstanding. The book is fine, being simple to read and understand."
1,Mary Did You Know,"Disappointed...music was written in a different key than the original, and I thought the shipping and handling were exhorbitant!!! Almost nine dollars for sheet music@@@"
5,The PERFECT Christmas gift!,"This is an exquisite jewel of a gift, suitable for just about everyone on your list! The CD is performed by the composer of this most beautiful Christmas song and the book which houses it is beautifully done with illustrations and prose that will remind everyone of the true meaning of Christmas. Plus, the modest price makes it possible to buy one for all the special people on your list!"
3,sarcastic sander,i love this as a detail sander but had a hard time using the adhesive backed strips for the profiles. As soon as the rubber gets even the littlest dirty the sandpaper comes off due to the 6000 strokes per min speed of the sander. I used this sander on my new woodwork for sanding where my palm sander couldnt get. Also after about maybe 40 hrs of probably rough treatment the switch on mine went out and I had to send it in to have it replaced. I havent used it since and have no other experience with detail sanders to say if this is par for the course.
4,A Great Peter Murphy Primer,"I was elated to see that there was a new Peter Murphy album out in stores. While the song selection is fantastic, it leaves something to be desired. If you have all of his previous releases, you already have all of the songs on Wild Birds. This is definitely a great album for someone just discovering the talents of Peter Murphy - or for a situation that your cd amount is limited - like when travelling."
4,Check this one out!,"I am a big fan of 80's music, especially punk and was turned onto Bauhaus in the last few years. I decided to check out this cd of Murphey's solo works and found it very different from Bauhaus, but quite enjoyable. If you are not very familiar with his solo efforts, you need to check this one out."
3,"But, no """"Tale of the Tongue""?","As mentioned in a prior review, it's such a shame this wonderful song from a non-LP 12"" single was left off this comp., and relagated to obscurity on a Japanese CD, or simply on the original vinyl. Also, so many earlier and worthy moments are missing. A wasted opportunity, for sure."
5,wild birds takes flight....,"this is the album to buy if you are a hardcore peter murphy fan or even remotely curious about the work of this goth king. here we find some of the greatest solo work ever recorded by ex-frontman for the famous goth band bauhaus and it should come as no surprise his work has been highly underrated or overlooked. at times, his voice reminded me of neil diamond perhaps or perhaps even david bowie at times. here we have every song which in my opinion could've or should've received massive play on mtv or radio for that matter and even the oddities which may not garner much attention but nevertheless are extremely beautiful and deep. only slight disappointment i have here is the absence of great songs like strange kind of love or perhaps marlene dietrich's favorite poem. having said that, i do love this cd and would recommend it to anyone."
4,"Depressing, but a decent read",Makes you wonder how the Irish Government could allow this type of stuff to go on and for as long as it did. Very sad.
4,C++,Book came in great condition. The way the book is writen it is a little hard to understand but maybe that is just me.
1,The order took a month to arrive,"Hate the seller (textbooksnow) and strongly suggest everyone not to purchase from this seller at all. It gave me a hard time running and inquiring to the post office, one month after purchase date. It's really bad for college students."
2,I wish book could provide some selected solutions for the exercises,"I't is really annoying trying to figure out the codes for the programs. first 3 chapters is a piece of cake, but as you keep moving on, it gets harder, and harder.Very bad book, if you don't know something about c language. But, I like the way the book is written. But exercises can tend to be tedious and frustrating without some hints."
5,Creating Much Needed Awareness,"For those passionate about Malawi, this book is a ""must read""It provides numbers, statistics and a great overview of the conditions of the country and the daily struggles the people face to survive."
2,Reference,"It may work for a reference, but detailed answers cannot be found inside. I found it lacking in questions I needed answered."
4,Minimalist Masterpiece!!!!,"This is one of the first of the ""minimalist"" movement. Though it is hard to ""HEAR"" It is wonderful to ""LISTEN"" to. Every fan of the minimalist movement should atleast listen to this recording. I would say this recording is ""essential"". Highly recomended."
4,Lose yourself.,I enjoyed listening to this work quite often in college and still replay it in my mind at times. Get lost in your imagination and add your own playing if your mind can handle it.
5,fresh,"I am not shure if any of the reviewers here are reffering to this recording... This is not the ""original"" recording of In C - this is a performance od Shanghai Film ORchestra, adding another two ""eastern"" compositions to the CD.This performance is extraordinary, a flowing of soundscapes, real musical streams, In C sounds even more like some ethereal far-eastern music when played by all those chinese instruments and the other two compositions fit together with it perfectly. I think this is a really gorgeous contemporary music."
1,Horrid,This book is an outgage to anyone from Alabama and the south. This author should never be allowed in the state. The books principles are outdated as well as the characters ways of thinking.
1,"Great potential, but could use a re-write","I have read Lois Battle before, and thought her a very good writer indeed, but she needs to go back to the drawing board on this one. From characters who slip in and out without being well developed, to stating that Agnes Scott College, one of the finest women's colleges in the country, is nothing more than ""a southern ladies' school...that's not a first-rate college"", Ms. Battle shows that she has not taken the time necessary to write a really good book. The bones are there...she just needs to put some flesh on them."
4,A fun southern read,"I liked this book and my favorite parts were almost theatrical. I loved the Holiday Thanksgiving scene and the ladies sewing society watching the Jane Austen movie. I thought both were hilarious and brilliant and worth reading the book for alone. The middle to me was stronger than the beginning or the end, because I thought the way the characters interacted was more interesting than the plot or even the love interest. Brilliant ironic, witty writing and dead on group conversations."
3,Easy Fun Read,"On the back of the book, a reviewer wrote, ""Lois Battle is one of those fearless novelists who can take on any subject and make it distinctly her own. The Florabama Ladies' Auxiliary & Sewing Circle is a magical and surprising tour of a Deep South I had no idea existed. It's the best novel she's ever written.""That high praise came from Pat Conroy, so I was prepared to have my world rocked, as his books have done before. Though, I won't say she showed me a south I did not know before (I LIVE in Alabama), I will say she gave me some new items to chew on. Her charcters come to life and a few of them become your best friends. I know, I wanted Hilly to get her man so bad, and I was rooting for Bonnie all the way. Not on a level with Mr. Conroy, but still a real page turner, to be cliche. I stayed up late reading, anxious to devour more of the story."
1,Trite Trite Trite,"This author never heard a cliche she didn't like. It's as if she took a list of cliches and wrote a book to just to incorporate them. The conversations among the characters are unbelievably trite and simplistic. In my opinion this is one of the most poorly written books I have read in a long time. I was surprised to see that this was not a first book. It is annoying to read, a waste of money."
3,It could have been better,"It took my a long time to finish the last 70 pages of The Florabama Ladies' Auxiliary and Sewing Circle because I just got bored with the story. Lois Battle has a wonderful writing style, and the characters were well-defined; but style is only one element to a great book. The plot seemed like even it got bored with itself, and all it wanted to do was to find some sort of closure.It also seemed like Battle couldn't decide who the main character was, so we get random chapters from the perspective of a few other characters. I don't mind getting other perspectives, but it seemed a bit inconsistent, almost forcing the reader to invest emotion to certain characters.For the most part I enjoyed it, but it just kind of fizzled out toward the end."
4,Florabama Ladies' Auxiliary & Sewing Circle,"Was plesantly supprised by this book! My son and daughter-in-law gave it to me for Christmas and could not put it down. Usually I read books of mystery or books that grab my attention and move very fast. Being a southerner, I think Lois depection of the life in a small town was very realistic and recognised several personalities. A very good read."
2,Not the South Alabama I know,"I really wanted to like this book. When I started to read it, I was shocked to find that the setting was the community college my mother and I both attended. My mother, my grandmother and I were all born in this area. My aunt ran a sewing machine in the mill that moved to Mexico. In short, this book hardly rings true. It read like the impressions of an outsider looking in. This is not the book to teach someone about women in the South, especially not women in the new South. It sells short the fascinating and colorful women of the Alabama Gulf Coast."
2,Well-written but dull...,"I read this novel with a lot of anticipation because I had read positive reviews in the newspapers. Lee writes gracefully but I just got tired of Hara's carefully-wrought observations and the generally quiet, monotonous pace of the narrative. I began sympathizing with Hara's daughter. I wanted to get away from him, too! I also found the melodramatics near the end a bit too heavy-handed. The tale within the tale was intriguing but I felt I entered a totally different novel. I finished this novel out of obligation, as I try to read all new fiction by Asian American writers."
2,High Expectations Dashed,"I had very high expectations for this book. After meeting the author at a book signing in Boston a year ago, I eagerly awaited for the arrival of his follow-up to Native Speaker. A Gesture Life seems fragmented in its goals and I had trouble getting into the narrative. I found the main character unsympathetic and the overall plot wayward and unfocused."
2,Disappointing,"Having lived in Asia for 14 years (Korea for 10 years), I am an avid reader of English language books by Asian authors.However, I was disappointed in A Gesture Life. It was so bogged down in describing in detail the everyday emotions of the main character that is was quite boring at times. It certainly did not move fast enough to hold much of my interest.As a single American who also adopted a Korean child (my son, when he was only 3 years old), I could empathize with Franklin Hata's frustrations in trying to overcome the barriers between he and Sunny. The experiences in that regard gave me insight to my own ongoing struggle to help my son adjust.To be fair to Mr. Lee, the author, I believe I will read his first book, Native Speaker, and see if I will be more impressed."
2,overpraised,"Gesture life gets my nomination for the most overpraised work of literature in recent years. P.C. or not, I question whether the work would have received a fraction of the accolades had it not been written by an otherwise very talented Asian-American man, but admit it: gesture life is ponderous and rather dull. One can sympathize intensely with the suffering of the type of people portrayed without agreeing that the book is particularly entertaining. A must-read only for those who feel they ""must."""
2,disjointed,"Like pulling teeth, ""Gesture Life"" is a book that has garnered many accolades from both the press and my book-loving friends. Save your time! This story is so disjointed and obtuse that making sense of it will give you a headache. Sunny is the only believable character in the story, but he seems a mere afterthought until the metaphors are finally played out."
1,overrated,"Shockingly overrated. Gesture Life has been garnering accolades from so many critics - this reader has only one question : why? There is nothing exceptional about this story. It is pretentious, self-righteous, and sanctimonious. The characters are amazingly one-dimensional, and the self-congratulatory structure makes it almost painfully difficult to read. From a thematic point of view, it explores almost nothing new and lacks originality. Overall, an irritating novel which doesn't deserve a single measure of the superfluous praise it has received"
4,Much Better than Native Speaker!,"Overall, this was an excellent novel - very well thought out, with a lyrical and fluid narrative that gets the reader caught up in the narrator's situation and his complex feelings about his wartime behavior. My only concern was some of the dialogue - it felt a little stiff and unreal between the Japanese narrator and some of his neighbors. Also, I wondered how much racism this character actually experienced, being an outsider in this small town? Lee rarely touches on this. However, I found this novel to be much better than Native Speaker, Lee's first novel."
5,NOT Doing the Right Thing,"If you are drawn to humble but flawed characters, you will likely find this book as astounding as I did. The book is narrated, through present time and flashback, by a narrator who is trapped inside his own personality (aren't we all!). The author, meantime, artfully ensures that we the reader can guess at a bigger picture than the narrator. We are given a kind of omniscient viewpoint, hoping and nudging the narrator to struggle through to happiness and connection - pounding our forehead when - once again - he fails himself and others. But what do we really know? As the story unfolds, we become better acquainted with the history the narrator has suffered through, and our perceptions of his failings are leavened with a terrible pity. Language soars in this book, giving the delicate and wonderful story an exquisite patina."
3,Heart wrenching,"Heart -rending throughout and charged with emotion . Author is similar to Thomas Hardy in that he shows profound understanding of the pysche of characters of the opposite sex. A little humour (even if it be ""dark"" humuor) and an element of hope through learning from tragedy could take this already good novel to an even higher realm."
3,Native Speaker is much better,"It's the language Chang-Rae Lee is so good at. In Native Speaker, despite the unrealistic bit about the spy business, his language sparkled whereas in A Gesture Life, I found it stuffy and banal and the narrarive method way too coventional. I don't know about other readers but the whole thing about Hata's life in a Westchester village rings terribly false. I know so well what Westchester is like.Because of the pure joy of his language, I couldn't wait to read this book. Well, it is boring!!! I coulnd't go on but I still went on. Native Speaker was much better."
4,Carefully crafted work of art,"I have enjoyed this book and admire its author for the stimulating plot and vivid depiction of both what was witnessed and what was felt by Franklin Hata.This kind of novel must be treated with care however. Issues surrounding the ""comfort women"" - those Japanese, Korean and other Asian women recruited to work in Japanese frontline brothels during WWII - has been hugely politicized and sensationalized. The issues, and books/films about them, have been used not only as legitimate guide into this tragic event in history but also as a way to vent prejudice and hate against today's Japan and Japanese people. We must not succumb to the temptation of racially-charged Japan-bashing again. We must, however, ensure to keep ""comfort women"" part of our historical remembrance and vow to respect the human rights of every individual at all times - even during the most bitter and bloody war.Overall Lee has written a book worth reading -"
2,Beautifully written!,"Downside is that it is less a cohesive novel with a plot and a beginning, middle and end and more a collection of exercises in writing, albeit beautifully written."
2,MIND-readers,"This book was somewhat of a disappointment. I began reading this book thinking surely an award winner must be great, and ended up wondering if I'd missed something along the way. Though the general theme of the book became clear about midway, most of the fact presentations were disjointed and unclear. When the author switches to a little bit of what might be considered poetry, towards the end of the book, the reader is tossed into confusion. The author really should have considered the fact that most readers are not MIND-readers and could not possibly decipher the hidden meanings behind some of the passages. I wouldn't recommend this book too highly to anyone, and as far as critic's recommendations, I haven't yet found one worth it's salt."
2,Dull,"I don't understand why so many people found his writing style so interesting. Lee writes in fragments; it's like listening to Dan Quyale! I grew tired of having to re-read paragraphs to figure out what he is trying to say in her muddled dribble. This is not unique and interesting; it's a total disregard for correct grammar. Other than the awful prose, the book was painfully boring."
2,too laboring,"There are books that you can just eat each pages off of and there are books like A Gesture life, where every page is a painful reminder that you just wasted your time and money. I really wanted to like this book because i liked Lee's Native Speaker, but this one proves to be a curse of the sequel projects."
4,You either love it or you hate it,"Chang Rae Lee did an excellent job in what he set out to do. The story that revolves around an aging Korean/Japanese man might not involve an action packed plot like Tom Clancy's novels, but that is only understandable. I feel that Lee has written a remarkable story that interjects some very important insights to Asian American sensibilties. It certainly can not and does not claim to represent Asian American life in a nutshell, but some of the aspects have been seemless addressed and shared and he comes across very honest. And, it is not surprising that some people just really don't like the story. This usually happens when people don't like a particular subject matter no matter how it is written."
1,Painful Memories,"A Gesture Life describes a painful secret life of Hata, whose life is a series of varnished externalities. Like the protagonist, this book is nothing but a series of polished sentences and emotional triggering events. I bet Harlequin Romance reader would enjoy this sappy attempt at a historical subject."
1,worst book,"This is the worst book I ever tried to read! I just don't get it. Maybe it is a sign of my literary ignorance. I tried to read , but it was too painful to endure. For me, the book had no redeeming qualities - not the characters, the plot (or lack thereof), or the writing style. A complete waste of time."
2,Could have been a short story,"Franklin Hata was a profoundly annoying and pathetic character. I think that the author is trying to portray him as a thoughtful, sensitive, good man yet his actions portray him as one lacking strength of character and the ability to love. He let so many opportunities to love and to understand others pass him by that I found him to be a pain in the neck. Maybe a focus on plot instead of character would have saved this book - that's why I would have probably enjoyed it in a short story format."
1,I didn't like this book,"I found this to be one of the worst books i have ever read in my life. It is almost impossible to follow the storyline as the main characters perspective is amazingly introverted and scenes are sometime fragmented causing confusion. This story is nothing new and has been written since the invention of words a million times over, and i really have no comprehension of why this book is considered good literature"
1,Hiroshima Guilt,Amazon carefully screened & censored any negative reviews of this wallow in victimist self pity and resentment. Yukio Mishima is immeasurably superior.
1,hearsays,"this book was on the libirary selections so me being an Asian and the writer himself being one, i immediately picked it up and read it. i was very dissapointed with his use of bad history to write a novel based on total hearsays."
1,"I resent being called an ""Asian-American""","It's just like being called a 'minority'. These phrases are used to further balkanize human beings into little tribes. I may have Asian descendants, but who cares? Mr. Lee does not speak on behalf of me nor do other self-appointed Asian-Americans. I'm a Human Being, first. An American, second. And probably a Basketball Player, third. (I'm 6'3, which is too tall for some tribes)If you are going to label me, label me this: TALL-GOOD-LOOKING AMERICAN OF ASIAN ANCESTRY WHO HATES BEING CALLED ASIAN."
3,A minor disappointment ...,"I had mixed feelings about this book. There's no doubt that Lee's syle of prose and rhetorical skill is excellent, but the book is constricted by its slow pace and overly conscientious form of writing. Franklin Hata is irrevocably weak and reluctant, yet he still remains to be amazingly ""persistent."" Sunny's character is somewhat sparse, I readily inferred much of her defiance through her misconduct but sought a deeper explanation for it. However, I do commend Lee for his portrayals of the korean comfort women. It is a poignant reminder of the dangerous afflictions of hopelessness and tragedy and that wartime can render monsters in men. Lee not only confronts the perils of the yellow man, but the silent echoes of the women who died fallen and unanswered."
3,Intriguing!,"The author provides a thought-provoking examination of how one Oriental man conducts his life in order to be accepted and deemed ""proper"" by others of his community. Parts of the story seem a bit hard to follow because of movement back and forth in time, occasional significant scenes too sketchily described, and lack of important history (especially Sunny's childhood). Nevertheless, the novel succeeds in its beautiful use of language and ability to evoke a wide range of emotions as it poignantly examines one man's feelings. It is an attention-getting, fascinating story, especially about the comfort girls of the Japanese Imperial Army during World War II. The novel makes a major contribution to American literature about the Asian immigrant experience."
3,Why Heinz made 57 varieties,"Whenever I read Amazon reader reviews I am amazed by the contrasts. How can a book evoke such opposite responses? I found ""A Gesture Life"" too distanced to be really enjoyable. I read the whole thing because it was considered by The New Yorker magazine to be on of 1999's five best novels. I would have to disagree. I simply could not connect to any of the characters. I recommend ""Disgrace,"" by JM Coetze (Booker Prize winner for 1999) to anyone who wants to be really, deeply touched by the portrait of a man and his daugter."
3,weak narrative energy,"i liked this book, though not as much as ""native speaker"" ""gesture life"" reminded me of kazuo ishiguro's ""remains of the day."" lee's prose is graceful and polished, but the novel as a whole is emotionally scattered and narratively flabby. entire sections could have been cut from the book without hurting the main story."
5,A gentle soul,"Doc Hata is a gentle man with a split personality. Brought up Korean, he tries to fit into the Japanese army - and fails. Coming to Westchester County, he tries to be ""American"" - and fails. His gentleness really is the cowardice to face things as they are. Even with his daughter - he fails. Doc Hata is a Walter Mitty who dreams that he is a good soldier, an accepted American, a dutiful father. The whole book is a dream and should not be taken literally. The author weaves a wonderful net, in superb language and meticulous attention to detail. Maybe the book was promoted wrong and readers expected something more down to earth."
4,An interesting read,"This book was very interesting,it tells about a man his life in the present and how it was in WWII. The lead character Franklin(Doc)Hata owns a medical shop,that is named after his adopted daughter Sunny. In the story he flashes back to the war and his involvement. I really enjoyed this book,but I found it a little confusing."
2,Not satisfying,"I really wanted to like this new book by Mr. Lee because Ienjoyed his previous book The Native Speaker. Unlike his earlier work,his vision and insights are unclear and meandering in this one. Ithink this is due to Mr Lee's tendency to rely soley on his writing technique of invoking reader's emotions by his subtle style of writing. These techniques can only go so far to satisfy a literature lover like me. It's like painting a bright color outside of a house yet inside it's a shamble. As this book shows, the novel can not be soley dependent on techniques and execution of styles but also requires the innate talent and insights of bold new imaginations, which along with this book and many other books lack."
2,Peculiar,"Gesture life is an akward follow up to his previous book, the Native speaker. The protagonist of this book spent his whole life as an outsider to his country and his residence: the theme follows the dull retrace of Hata's conflicting psyches. This book might have worked if it were a spy novel, but as a literary tryout, i found this book to be a total time waister."
4,Masterfully written,"A gritty piece of sand settles early within the bindings of the book. The incidents in Franklin's life are disturbingly irritating. As the story unfolds Chang-rae Lee masterfully encases the story in one iridescent layer after another of rich voluminous narrative culminating in a lustrous pearl of a book.The San Francisco Chronicle Online Book Club chose Chang-rae Lee's ""A Gesture Life"" for it's 10/17 - 11/20 selection. Please join us by chiming in our online bulletin board. We would love to hear any additional thoughts that you might have."
5,hidden identities,"Chang-Rae Lee's best skills are in exploring how we all must assume and disguise our identities, so often that what was once fake"" becomes ""real."" The whole idea of an old Korean man in America ""pretending"" to be Japanese to fit in with a bunch of rich NYers struck me as darkly funny. Franklin Hata's experiences as a soldier and with the comfort women were the best part of the book for me. I greatly appreciated Mr. Lee's ability to show the complicated relationship of the colonizer and the colonized in this novel and not simply fall back on the ""tried and true"" image of the Japanese Army as a ravenous, blood-thirst institution bent on world destruction. I think Mr. Lee convincingly captures the mood of the day. Hata as the opressed Korean in Japan, as the privileged colonial in the Army, as the conquering soldier ""liberating"" Western colonies in Asian, his life is filled with reversals and contradictions. I eagerly await Mr. Lee's next work."
4,"Big fan, somewhat disappointed","Long time fan. Wanted to love this DVD but the sound quality and performance was somewhat off when compared to his previous DVD. Also the pricing was a bit high.Still a fan, but will most likely grab the other DVD when I want a great show."
4,Too much rambling and going on tangents but good advice,"Mentzer tends to ramble too much and go off on tangents. As a result you will not hear much about the actual weight training program and advice till around page 102, the Chapter, ""Let's Get to It."" This book could and should have been much shorter. He is not cocksure and reminds readers that everyone's body will respond differently to excercise. High intensity training or the Mentzer method is about training for a short duration with high intensity. If your progress slows in response to lifting weights, you need to higher the intensity of your workouts, as opposed to working out for a longer duration."
2,Terribly overpriced!,"I have the UR3 strap on dildo from Doc Johnson and I like it a lot because it's super soft and feels like real skin (I think some brands call it cyberskin). The only problem is that it's not stiff enough, certainly not as stiff as the real thing. This dildo says its made from 2 different kinds of silicones, so I thought it would be just like the UR3 but with a stiffer core. It is stiffer, but the outer layer of silicone just isn't soft enough for me. I also wish the dildo was a little slimmer with a more pronounced head. I thought I was a fan of the Tantus brand, but so far the only product of theirs that I love is the Feeldoe. Oh, one last complaint...our revolution dildo had a small nick in the silicone when we got it and I'm afraid that bacteria may hide there even if I wash it thoroughly."
2,Too Big,"Liked the feel of the material of the product, but the circumference was larger than expected (seemed to be larger than avertized)6 inches around. My wife did not care for it at all; she threw it out."
4,Good basic rock.,I bought this CD in Germany in 1993 on the recommendation of three German teenagers. The band is older but kids like them. Some of their music is anti-racist. It's heavy for a German band but middle-of-the-road rock for an American band. The music has a good beat and strong melodies.
3,Not a substitute for a Jump Start,"From the Magellan's catalog description:""PLEASE NOTE THAT THE LABEL ON THE AUTO JUMPER STATES THAT IT WILL RECHARGE A *DEAD* BATTERY IN 10 MINUTES. THIS IS ONLY TRUE FOR SMALL ITEMS SUCH AS A CELL PHONE OR A LAPTOP BATTERY. THE AUTO JUMPER IS DESIGNED TO RECHARGE A WEAK CAR BATTERY, BUT WILL NOT RECHARGE A COMPLETELY DEAD ONE. ""So if you've left your lights on for three hours (like many people do), don't expect this little gizmo to get you going. However, it IS a handy, sealed, self-contained source of 12 volts for many purposes, with a built-in recharging system."
1,Doesn't work -- there's no miracles!,Description doesn't provide this device's capacity.Just says 5Amps. I found that this battery has 1.5Ah (Amp*hour)Compare with your car battery 75Ah capacity and top current of150Amp and you'd see that only by miracle it can recharge yourcar's battery or help you jump-start.
1,It didn't work as advertised. Don't waste your money!,"No stars for this product even though the stupid Amazon reveiw site made me give it one. This product is a waste of money, don't buy it!You will be sorry."
1,Did not work,I tried to recharge my car's battery with this product. Followed instructions as they came with the package. Did not work.
1,doesn't work,this item doesn't work. i had to end up charging my car battery with an electric one. i followed all the instructions as the paper said and it doesn't work. how can i return it and get my money back?thanks!
3,Looks Good to Me!,"I do not have this device yet but from what I gather, this device helps you jump your car only. I don't see why some of the comments are leading to wanting a complete charge to your battery when that is not the case. I might have misinterpreted their comments but I would guess that small device will not completely change a battery. Just give you enough juice to start it. My biggest concern is that what if you forget to charge the device after six months. What then?"
2,Not enough juice to jumpstart a car,"Maybe if your battery is just a little low and the engine is barely cranking, then this may make a difference to get your engine starting. If your battery is completely dead then forget about this as there is not enough power in this small battery pack. The battery losses the ability to hold a charge fairly quickly. You have to constantly keep it charging."
1,DOES NOT WORK AT ALL,This does not work at all. I WISH I'd read these reviews before buying the thing -- and being stuck with a dead battery.
1,misleading product....not recommended,"I purchased this product thinking it would be a perfect solution if I am stranded with a dead battery. I have been stranded 2x with this product and I still had to reset my radio settings. It is not strong enough to jump a V8 engine.1. The picture on the web does not show the true size.....it's about 10 inches in length. There are other products available with the same battery amps but much smaller.2. The cord is entirely too short.....it hangs off of the dash versus sitting out of the way on the floor or seat.3. There is no indicator that tells you when this is fully charged, it only shows when it's on or off.4. When I thought I was going to send this back I was reminded by amazon that batteries are non returnable items!"
1,not starting up after fully charged,"I have wasted my money and time. Finally, I need to call a garage to jump start my car. I got very upset."
1,Does not work,"This product did not work for me. It was a total waste of my money because it couldn't be returned. Amazon's return policy - ""For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com."
5,Convience,Bought this for my grandmother who is always leaving a light on in her car. No longer a need for her to call the tow company. Very safe & convenient product.
4,travel needs,"Bought this for use as emergency back-up when traveling out of town...saves waiting for roadside assistance and provides a sense of security. If your car battery is ""gettin' old"" I would suggest you have this in the vehicle at all times."
1,Sad day,"A very sad day to report a Patricia Cornwell book is not worth the effort of even finishing it. I love this author and the charactors - well I can't say that is true anymore. I could not get past the first 3 chapters without shuting the book in disgust. The characters I loved are now so unrecognizable to me now. Cornwell has taken the most interesting aspects of each one of them and twisted them into bloody pulp. I was going to give this book away, but do not want to inflict it on anyone - so will toss in the landfill."
1,Bad beyond words!!,"I've read every one of her early books and loved them all. She's obviously run into a really bad wall. As much as I enjoyed her before, I couldn't get past page 37 on this one. I'm done readng Patricia Cornwell."
1,Obsessively self-critical,"Cornwell's books were ground breaking. Gorey, but fascinating. Scientific and well-written. A precursor to CSI...but her more recent books, and Predator in particular, have degenerated into a confused plot of unreasonably intertwined and obsessively self-hating characters. Why does Cornwell think that her characters are so special that all the kooks would be after them? Why does Cornwell have to let us know every unhappy, angry, twisted, and often irrelevant thought of each character? Cornwell seems most interested in the uniform psychology of these damaged and self-destructive has-been characters. The book is painful to read."
3,At least Predator was better than Blowfly,The first few chapters were pretty awful and difficult to read. After I got past chapter 7 (I think) I started to recognize Patricia Cornwell's writing.I keep hoping she'll get better. Perhaps she should stop with the Kay stories and start over from scratch.This book has nothing on the first few that actually kept me awake at night. At least it was better than Blowfly. That book re-defines dreadfull.I now wait and get Patricia Cornwell books from the library.
2,Disappointing,"While the elements of a great novel are here, they just don't come together the way that they do in earlier Scarpetta novels. The main storyline is interesting and there are many intriguing connections between various subplots, but this time around, these elements are largely left hanging for a rather dissatisfying ending. We have loose ends and unanswered questions, vague gestures at both things that happened before this novel began (and after Trace ended), and few suggestions about where things are going, but the the book just stops. I actually wondered if my copy was missing pages.Not Cornwell's best work, to be sure. The novel needs to actually resolve all the issues that are raised instead of just leaving us with what feels like a slapdash ending."
1,poor effort by Cornwell,"I have been reading the Scarpetta series since it's inception. They have been going downhill. With the latest, Predator, I am left utterly confused with all the characters. The plotline jumps everwhere with no direction. There is no character left to care about. The author has Kay and Marino at odds for unknown reasons and left allother characters dysfuncional and unlikable.As of this writing, I am 3/4 of the way finished and don't really care if I complete the book or not. Cornwell is obviously selling the series on her previous reputation that is fast going down the tubes. Do not plunk down good money for this book."
2,Disappointed and confused,"Have read all of Cornwell's books and unfortunately she does not get better with age. Kay Scarpetta is enjoying a permanent anger and unhappiness with her world and her associates. Not clear why she and Marino are at odds, not clear why Lucy can't confide in her aunt anymore and truly not clear why Scarpetta has to take offense at everyone. Gone is the caring ME she once was. Added to all that, the story has too many holes and no explanations. Who ultimately put the hand prints on the body and why. How did this one character manage to travel back and forth between MA and FL so quickly and what happened to John/Laurel Swift?? Case not solved. Would not buy a hard back of Patricia Cornwell again."
2,What Happened?,"I am a long time Cornwell fan but I must agree with many of the other reviewers that this book is not up to the author's standards. I have enjoyed the Scarpetta series from the start. Here the complex character of Kay is lost to the rapid pacing and short chapters-I felt like I was reading a James Patterson Novel (who I can't stand!). All the great descriptions of Kay working at the crime scene, the great CSI stuff is all missing. I hope this is just blooper and not indicative of future works. I sometimes wonder if authors are being pushed to hard to produce and this might be the result?"
3,Oh dear....,"I have not read this book yet because I refuse to waste money on this now-questionable franchise. After reading these reviews, I'm not sure I will even waste my time on this book.***NOTE TO MS. CORNWELL***Everyone, everyone, EVERYONE HATES the 3rd person narrative. Ditch it or you won't recoup your ink costs in royalties!!!"
2,Predator by Patricia Cornwell,"This book is easy to read ,and if you like fast-moving, slick detection full of blood and guts, this book is for you. I must confess, however, that this type of detection leaves me cold."
1,Surprisingly terrible,"I got this book at a library sale. It was so bad that I can't believe it was published, despite the author's fame. There were frayed plot threads all over the place. I was offended by the sickening cruelty- it was like reading Dean Koontz.I was once a Cornwell fan.I actually threw this in the trash because I didn't want to inflict it on anyone else. I see that others did the same."
1,NOT a new novel,This was sold as a new novel by Patricia Cornwell and it most certainly is not. It is in fact a re-release of a novel with no real addition to the original and for that reason I have given it 1 star. The plot is typical Scarpetta but a bit strained and certainly not one of her best. Had I realized that it was a re-release I would not have purchased it.
4,Predator,"I am a Patricia Cornwell fan and try to read all her books. Amazon.com was very easy (customer friendly) to access to order and delivery was very timely. Thank you very much, this was a painless experience."
1,stop the pain!,"I couldn't wait for the book to be over! Scarpetta, Marino, Wesley, and Lucy are churlish and tired; no one seems to like each other anymore, and I didn't like any of them anymore, either! The forensic detail, which used to be interesting in previous Scarpetta books, became overwhelmingly tedious and the book turned into a technical showcase for Cornwell's scientific knowledge rather than an entertaining read. Excrutiating to listen to, and quite unsatisfying when it finally concluded. As my friend, another avid Cornwell listener, commented, ""I didn't even know they had solved the crime!"""
1,Garbage!,I wish Patricia Cornwell and Putnam could be forced to read each and every one of these reviews. Maybe then they would realize it's time to stick a fork in this series...it's finished.
2,not thrilled,"Both the dialogue and plot often felt forced, and failed to hold my interest. The lead characters seemed two-dimensional caricatures who were chronically angry and almost as unappealing as the villains. This contrasts with early books in the series, where Kay Scarpetta, Marino, Lucy and Benton Wesley showed a more believable mixture of human shortcomings and positive atttributes, allowing the reader to care about what happened to them. I wonder if the author herself has grown bored with the characters and story-line, but feels obligated to continue producing Scarpetta books due to the series' best-seller history.Too tedious to be a thriller. Stick with earlier books in the Scarpetta series!"
2,Average,"I have been reading Patricia Cornwell's books since the mid-90s, and have always eagerly anticipated new releases. However, I have to say that I have been pretty disappointed with the last three novels. I really wish Ms. Cornwell would go back to the first-person narrative that always set her work apart from other authors in her genre. I don't like reading about the killer and what he/she is doing. I like to find out through Scarpetta's investigation who the perp is. I also have to agree with some of the other reviewers about Lucy, and how she has really become somewhat of a laughable, comic book character. Also, I am tired of every crime having some motivation involving Kay Scarpetta, Lucy, Marino, or Benton. Remember the old days, when every killer wasn't obsessed with Kay Scarpetta? I just can't pick up her new books with that old enthusiasm anymore. I have borrowed the last two from my local library, because I know they won't be good enough for me to shell out the dough."
2,Not her best but ...,"Come on now! ""Predator"" is certainly not Cornwell's/Scarpetta's worst! (That dishonor still goes to the creepy, dopey ""Blow Fly."") Sure, the plot bounces around a lot. So much that there are still a plot point or two that I still don't get. And yes, Lucy sure is tiresome. No, make that ""Shakespearean."" I live for the book where Cornwell gives poor Lucy a break and makes her biggest problem a bad hair day. But there was quite a bit I liked. Marino actually seems to be trying to build a life that doesn't necessarily revolve around ""the Doc."" The ending, while it came suddenly, is very well written. Remember the pink shoe. The way Cornwell works it into the story is moving and important."
2,Simply awful.,"This book was like half a book -- something Cornwell sat down and spewed out over a long weekend or so. In general, authors would then go back and edit their work, but it appears in this case that her half-baked manuscript somehow made it past all the editorial gatekeepers, straight to hard copy.I hate how everyone in Scarpetta's life is so dysfunctional, grumpy, and repetitive. And I hate how Cornwell left us hanging with so many unanswered questions and incomplete plot points (what the heck happened to Joe???). And I hate that I spent money on this awful book."
1,Too gross!,"I have always looked forward to a new Scarpetta book, and I don't like to rate a novel too quickly...BUT....Once Predator came out, the forensics and the torture were too graphic for me, and I work in an ER.I got sucked into buying ""Book of the Dead"" and already I am revulsed. Why does the torture always have to be sexually related, Is there something in her makeup we don't know about? I believe in graphic explanation of scenes and events, but her written sado-sexual-masochism is way too much."
1,PREDATOR,"NOTHING I CAN ADD TO WHAT HAS ALREADY BEEN SAID. THE BOOK WAS TOO OUTRE, FRAGMENTED. I COULD NOT FOLLOW ANY LINE AS EVERYTHING KEPT GOING BACK AND FORTH FROM ONE FLASHBACK TO ANOTHER. THE CRIMES WERE WAY BEYOND REALITY.LOUSY WASTE OF MY MONEY."
4,Why not...,"I thought Patricia Cornwell's book Predator was pretty good given the only other book I read of hers was Post Mortem, and I found that one to be very slow and dull.The story starts out with some killings that appear to be linked to Basil, a killer that is currently in a mental institute being tested by Benton Westly for the new project Predator.The book reminds me in a way of a Tarantino film, in that a lot of stuff is happening, so you have to be paying attention.The book is overall interesting, but a little slow at times."
1,"Really, REALLY Bad.","I give up. Cornwell has turned to greed and is just churning out garbage book after garbage book to keep the $$ rolling in. Ms. Cornwell, please, put your pen away and go quietly into retirement. I used to LOVE your books, but they began to deteriorate recently, and this book is pure trash. Which is where it went."
2,Did she write this just becasue she had to?,I am a big Cornwell fan...have read almost all her books...this one was very disppointing! Felt as if she didnt really put much thought into the book and just wrote it to get another one on the shelves.
1,Should be a zero star rating,"Usually enjoy Cornwell's books but this is awful. I put it down, half read and went to another one. Picked it back up and wondered why. What was Cornwell thinking? It gets zero stars in my opinion"
2,Good Story Ruined By Irritating Present Tense,"Even trapped in a hospital bed, I had a hard time getting through this story. I do not remember Ms Cornwell using present tense in her earlier books, but as soon as I read the first paragraph I knew reading this story would be a chore. I don't know if she is just being experimental, or her editors or agent are pressuring her to make the story more ""active,"" but I, for one hate it (present tense).Still, I managed to get through the story (didn't have anything else to do) and it got somewhat better toward the end. The characters are well drawn out and the plot is complex. I would have rated this much higher if it wasn't such a chore to slog through it.Please Ms Cornwell, use past tense!Can't recommend it, sorry. Try Kathy Reichs instead."
2,Predator,It seemed okay in the beginning and then it just unraveled. Too much in one book. Lucy's sexual orientation seems to lead this author into not knowing where to go. Marino is what - at this point? I used to like him. And the last few pages - too much happening. I think it is time for Cornwell to retire.
2,what happened?,"I used to love the Kay Scarpetta novels. Blow Fly, the Body Farm, etc. were revelations to me. This was before the mega sucess of CSI and all the attendant other tv shows that detailed forensic work. The strong character of Kay Scarpetta and her contrariness, her complicated niece and streetwise cop friend were all characters that, maybe not loveable, were definitely intriguing. Now, I find myself repelled by all three of them. Kay is whiny (the worst is when she carps about hating coach class and having to ride in it ALL THE WAY to Los Angeles). Lucy is so depressive, she could be forcefed prozac and still jump off a bridge (""is it me? is it my body? is it my lack of a love life?""). The worst is what Cornell has done to Marino, he's become a junkyard dog instead of the streetwise cop that's seen and done most things. Ugh. My biggest question is: What happened?!"
3,Not Bad -- Formulaic Detective/Murder Mystery ....,"A rather formulaic murder story and detective ""who done it."" If you like Patricia Cornwell and her earlier books, you will probably enjoy this one. All of the usual elements of the formula are in place: Kay Scarpetta and her dysfunctional relationship with Benton Wesley, the unrequited mooning of Pete Marino over Scarpetta, the brilliant and wealthy lesbian protégé Lucy, et cetera, et cetera. We have heard it and seen it all before. If it is your cup of tea, then you will drink greedily from this particular offering.Even by standards of detective stories, large chunks of this one appears to depict sadism on a level that is difficult for the reader to stomach. Further, the ending appears to be hurried and thrown together, setting the stage for the inevitable next sequel. Set your watches and in perhaps nine months, there will be a follow-up book by Patricia Cornwell."
3,"Not terrible, but nowhere near her best work","I've read every single Kay Scarpetta novel and agree that the quality of this series has taken a downhill slide. For me, this started with Blow Fly, but I decided to give the series another chance.I admit that I was actually riveted with the story and finished it within a few days, however the ending left much to the imagination and there were a lot of unanswered questions, which seems to be Patricia Cornwell's forte these days. It's as though she has a deadline to meet and instead of wrapping things up, she just ends the novel.I have decided that if Cornwell comes out with yet another Scarpetta novel, I will buy it, however I will wait until I can get it used for really cheap. It will be Cornwell's last chance to prove herself, as far as I'm concerned."
3,Not great...but a must if you are a fan,"I have to admit I read other reader's reviews before I buy. Sometimes I pay attention to bad reviews and sometimes I get the book anyway just to see for myself. This time, not being able to skip a Scarpetta novel, I decided to see if all the bad press was deserved. It's not her best by any means. It's another book in Cornwell's Scarpetta series and as big a fan as I am...it's better than nothing! I guess the characters are all going through a mid-life crisis and I'm hoping they all get hormone therapy before the next book. I will keep reading them as long as Cornwell writes them. Redeem the characters and give us more. With all the bad they endure...let them at least have happy personal lives. That's my only complaint."
1,Very Disappointed!!!!,I stopped reading Cornwell's books a couple of years ago when she started emphasing homosexuallity so much in the niece of Kay Scarpetta. Then thought that I'd try again because I did enjoy the Scarpetta mystery series if not for that. Was terribly disappointed with this book. Won't waste my money on any of her books from now on. She's lost a good customer. There are too many other good writers out there. What has happened to her??
1,anticlimatic -,"I have read all of Cornwell's books, and have enjoyed them. I feel that she was trying to hard to be clever. The Marino has a hard on for Kay story line is a bit over done, the Lucy is loosing it is also over done. The entire book dragged till the last chapter, then it was just over. Done. I was left feeling that I wasted my time reading this book. She had lost her touch!"
1,Worst Book I ever heard-Part 11,How I managed to listen to 5 discs of this trash I will never know. Actually it is because I had nothing else. This is my second Cornwell book. I somehow managed to get through At Risk. Both are awful. No more Cornewll for me.
1,Had enough!,"I was one of Patricia Cornwell's biggest fans but her last few books have really disappointed me. ""Predator"" was by far the worst one yet. I couldn't even follow what was going on most of the time. Pete Marino is a biker? Where is the forensics? Lucy is a rich spoiled girl with too many toys. Kay Scarpetta?I didn't even see the real Kay Scarpetta in this book. Don't waste your time reading this one! I'll not buy another Cornwell book!"
1,I'm not sure why I'm finishing this book...,"I'm in the last quarter of this book, and out of sheer momentum, I'll likely finish. I doubt I'll read another in this series, and that's a shame. They were so good, once.The characters have become -- ALL of them -- utterly unsympathietic and distasteful. The plot, while not as incredible as the amazing back-to-life soap-opera plot device in earlier books, is weak.I'm off to find a new author to follow. Wish me luck."
1,"Definitely NOT her best work - in fact, I'd call it her worst","I generally have enjoyed Cornwell's books after getting hooked on her by my mom. This book, though, leaves A LOT to be desired. It is simply just bizarre, hard to follow and basically not a good book.It's sad when authors ""automatically"" get a good writeup on a new book based on their past work vs. the current work - and I have to say, I'm going to think twice about buying another of her books - I may go to the library and try her next one, but I certainly won't be spending my hard earned money on it --especially if they continue on this vein."
2,Boring;as if written by a twelve year old....,"I'm sorry;I hate giving Ms. Cornwell a bad review but thisstinker deserves it. The Predator is so simply written,I would have passed it by when I was twelve. Just like the scene whereluminol(isn't there anything more interesting and up to date?It's like Scarpetta & Lucy are carrying around a box that says ""Junior Detectives Kit"" on the side),shows up splattered blood and ""maybe or maybe not bleach"" in the Beach Bums storeroom. Maybe it's got a plot,maybe not.Scattershot plot,characters no longer interesting- I just don't care about them anymore.Can the idea be to slowly show how each once younger and heroic character slides into despair,redundancy,and finally obscurity because of the criminal element they have worked with for years?If that is the case,could I respectfully suggest an entirely new series?"
1,Bought with hope - won't buy the new one,"Found the story confusing with story lines not tied up. Still not sure about a lot of the ""plot"" but the one that is driving me nuts is what was the reason for the red hand prints?"
1,wha??,"The biggest problem with this ""Scarpetta"" novel is that there isn't much Scarpetta!!! And who is this new Marino? And was there any need to tell us about his latest relationship?? We get it--he's in love with Kay. And Lucy--whoa. Benton--whatever! And, violent death is gross--we get that as well. No need for the graphics, Ms. Cornwell.You're such an amazing author--please get back to the good stuff!!"
1,"Bad to worse - I didn't want to give it one star, they made me do it.",There's a good reason why I hesitate to keep reading a once-popular writer - because inevitably they succomb to success and start turning out drivel. It happened to John Grisham and it happened even sooner to P. Cornwell. Only her first 3 books were worth reading. Yet somehow Reichs and Fairstein keep turning out fascinating forensic mysteries. Maybe it's because they really care and it's not just about the money.
2,"I was disappointed, not her best effort","I usually like to read Patricia Cornwell's books. Trace was such a good book, then Predator was so full of holes, it was a huge disappointment. There was no solid storyline and very disjointed. I was very, very disappointed. Her usual characters were shallow and there was no follow through as to their fate. I speed-read the book, I was so disappointed but felt I had to read it through.Syd O."
2,PATRICIA'S PLOT NEEDS SOME FORENSIC WORK,As a longtime fan of the Scarpetta character and the many novels she appears in this book was a bit of a disappointment. The succsessful formula of previous books has not found its way into this novel. The plot is somewhat disjointed and the focus has turned away from the tight forensic mysteries of previous efforts and more to personality conflicts and even stranger than strange personalities that simply do not carry the story. An unfortunate effort that I hope will not be repeated.
1,Cornwell's Corn,"I am mystified by this Author's success in selling the trash she writes. I aquire her novels from libraries and friends (I will not buy one). Each Book seems to have fewer pages and bigger letters. Her first Novels were insightful and entertaining, even though she followed the same formula. Her Kay Scarpetta character is ready for retirement. Perhaps Ms. Cornwell should consider the same option.DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!"
1,This Book Is Awful!,"I liked the early Patricia Cornwell/Kay Scarpetta books. No doubt, Cornwell can be a very good writer. She isn't in this book. It is gruesome way over the top, brutal (unnecessarily so), too sexual and blasphemeous, for a start. Frankly, I am wondering about the state of Patricia Cornwell's mind. I'm also sorry I read the thing, and wish I had stopped sooner. Never, never again! This series is over for me."
1,Formerly great characters turned into annoying caricatures,"I used to love the Scarpetta series, but she started on a downward trend with Black Notice, and it just keeps getting worse and worse. You used to root for Kay and Benton, now you find yourself mentally telling Benton to kick her sorry butt to the curb. Lucy is now a whiney psychopath, and Marino went from tough guy with a heart of gold to grating lunatic. This book had no valid plot, and nothing was solved.Stop writing Pat!! You haven't produced a good book in years, stop forcing something that isn't there!!!"
1,distasteful and irritating,"I have always been a Kay Scarpetta fan but she and all of the rest of the characters in Patricia Cornwells books have become... well irritating to borrow a phrase from a friend who also used to be a fan. I want to slap the whole lot of them and tell them to ""snap out of it!"" The description of the deviants are downright distatsteful. I won't be reading anymore and please Patricia - stop writing - it's painful to see these characters slip so far from where they used to be. I would have given this book a negative star... but that was not an option."
2,Predator prompts first-ever review...,"As an avid fan of Patricia Cornwell's novels, I eagerly dove in to 'Predator.' I would rate it as an average thriller, but it definitely missed the mark in the ongoing Scarpetta series. No closure to any of character issues;dark and brooding interactions that generated little sympathy for Lucy, Scarpetta, or Marino; and an ending that made me say ""so what?"""
1,DISAPPOINTED,"I am a huge fan of Patricia Cornwell. However, I am very surprised at how disappointed I am with this novel. There doesn't seem to be any connection to the stories..it is very disjointed. It seems that all of the characters are totally depressed with their lives and relationships. Basically, for me, there was really no suspense, not much of anything to bring me back after putting the book down."
1,I am truly sorry,"but this is the last Patricia Cornwell I will read. The 2 previous books were very dark, dreary & depressing, so I waited to get this one from the library instead of buying it. So glad I didn't waste money on it! Has she come to hate her characters? They are all dysfunctional."
1,"Patricia, Patricia, what has happened to you????","As I read this new endeaver I reached the point of regretting I'd spent the money to buy it in hardcopy. The earlier Cornwell is gone and I won't waste my money on this series any more. As I read this I kept thinking I must have missed something on a previous page...or how could I be so confused...especially as I neared the ending. When it finally came my reaction as I finished the final page was ""Wait a minute...what in the world happened here?"" If I could have given this book ""No stars"", I would have. Don't waste your time on this one!"
1,What a disappointment!,"What's happened to Patricia Cornwell? I've gone from ""not putting her books down"" to ""what a waste of time"". Her books were riveting and now they're boring and the characters are so flawed. This was my last chance of ""giving her another chance""."
1,down hill,"I used to be a fan of Cornwell's writing, but unfortunately her books have been on the decline for a number of years. I have stopped buying them or reading them after a number of disappointments. I'm sure this latest boring tomb will be in the bargain basement soon."
2,missing something,"Once again I am disappointed with the latest ""Kay Scarpetta"" novel.What gives? This series used to be one of my favorites and Patricia Corwell was once my favorite author. Not any more. I miss the old Kay, Benton, Lucy and Pete! Once again I really didn't care about the characters. Just wanted to finish the book so I could go on to another. Not really sure if I'll ever buy another Cornwell book again."
1,horrid,"I used to wait for the scarpetta series with unhealthy excitement. Now I am simply appalled. There seems to be no editing, and an attempt by author and publisher to milk every last cent out of loyal readers. The last several books have been increasingly violent, flimsy, travesties. I'm done with her books."
3,Disapponted in Disorder,I thought every plot thread would come together at the end and I was extremely disappointed. It's almost like Patricia Cornwell didn't know how to end it so all of a sudden in the last 5-10 pages it's over. Cornwell gives Lucy a brain tumor in this installment. Marino never seems to grow as a person--he's too one-dimensional.Every book has Benton and Scarpetta's relationship going over the rocks. As for the main plot thread...Most distinguished practitioners consider DID to be a phony diagnostic label.
3,Kay is no longer independent,"I picked this book up at a discount store - I was very surprised to find these here. Now I understand why. I was disappointed with the last two Kay Scarpetta novels. It took me abouut half the novel to get me interested in the story, and eventually I was hooked. I was disappointed with the ending because some of the issues of the book were not resolved. I also could do without the romance between Kay and Benton and the niece and her affairs. I wouldn't recommend this book to novices of Patricia Cornwell but was not too too bad or too time consuming."
2,Predator by Patricia Cornwell,"I have read all of the Kay Scarpetta books and was a huge fan. I was really disappointed in Predator. I did not understand the reason for Marino and Kay's awkward relationship, it was never explained. The ending I had to read at least twice and there were loose ends that were never tied up. If you have read the other books in the series, read this for yourself and see but this was by far the worst and I was disappointed in the way the characters that I have loved for so long were portrayed. There was just something missing."
1,who does what to whom and why? and do i care?,"o.k., i just finished listening to the C.D. of Predator, which i had downloaded on my I-pod. Well, i kept thinking the book was abridged, or maybe i had made a mistake in the download. It jumped around so much that i was convinced it was abridged, but it wasn't! i have so many questions, i can't even list them all, and think maybe we should all form an on-line group to see if any of us can answer them.1. was Johnny the doctor killed or was it suicide? and who killed him, and most importanly, WHY?2. why were the members of the family killed and how were they known by the serial killer?3. when did Kay and Benton make up, and why the heck is she always so angry?this is just the beginning!"
1,the end of the downward spiral,"It has been disappointing to watch the downward spiral of the Kay Scarpetta series but thankfully it has finally hit bottom for me. This will be the last Scarpetta and probably Cornwell book I buy. I can't even summarize the plot for a friend. I'm not sure what all the angst was about. It is a disjointed series of chapters with angy on-dimentionals characters all of whom could be serial killers. Any traces of humanity come from ""knowing"" these characters in the early books. Normally books are my escape. I wanted to escape from this book almost from the start but made myself finish it. There is no satisfaction to be found in this book, only mild annoyance at having wasted the time and money."
1,Predator,"What a disappointment! I bought this book the first day it came out...couldn't wait to read it and was so disappointed in the lack of attention to the characters that we have grown to love. It is amazing that instead of ""growing"" and ""progressing"" they just get more and more screwed up. Even Kay Scarpetta comes off like someone you wouldn't like if you met her. Hmmm. Not sure what is going on, but I wasn't even interested in the storyline...it was hard to follow. ..I have read all of her books and this is by far my least favorite. Darn."
3,"Come on, Patricia, what's going on?","I have loved the Kay Scarpetta novels for years and look forward to each new one. However, I found the characters depressing and empty in the last two novels. Obviously, there are many terrible things happening around them in each story, but they don't seem to have lives anymore.At this point I'm not sure why Benton and Kay are still together. I'm not exactly clear why Marino and Kay are fighting. I'm not clear why Lucy has become a wimp--a tumor would not get the old Lucy down. I miss the old characters."
1,Not a good book!,"Wish I had read other reviews before I bought this book. What a disjointed piece of work. Like many of the other reviewers, I have found Patricia Cornwellto be one of my favorite authors. What happened here? I am very disappointed and was unable to finish reading this book."
