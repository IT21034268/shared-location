4,Plenty of lively music,"I bought this handsom box few years ago and liked it very much;plenty of nice and jumping music; 10 discs full of Fats Waller's piano, organ and vocals (which I don't like that much, but many people do)...One star goes of for the lack of ANY discographical info."
2,Not terribly useful,"If you're interested in the ""after school special"" version of drug use then this is a book for you. If you're interested in a more realistic approach, look elsewhere."
3,Before its time,"I met Tony Noguera in late 1969 when he was travelling through Africa researching his book. In many ways the book was ahead of its time but Tony should have taken steps to ""establish"" himself either by getting some academic qualifications or becoming a journalist. In the event he did neither and allowed his father to pay for its publication by a vanity press. I think this was very unfortunate because had Tony continued his line of research he would have been part of the rising tide of researchers who dsicovered strong African infleunces not only in Egypt but Greece and elsewhere."
3,These remixes do not offer much...,"Let me first state that I am a Thievery Corporation fan, but this is an incredibly underwhelming CD. Most of the remixes do not really take the listener anywhere and do not significantly modify (or ""reconstruct"" or ""abduct"") the original recordings. If you want to enjoy Thievery Corporation, then purchase ""Sounds of the Hi-Fi"" or the ""DJ Kicks Compilation"". If you want to hear creative remixes of other artists, then buy Kruder & Dorfmeister."
5,more awsome from thievery corp.,"TC lived up to the reputation build on Hi-Fi. Great mixes with a variety of other established artists. Chillin', coolin', hangin'...this disk is an evolution of Hi-Fi while keeping the basic groove intact and alive. I play it all the time."
4,Good Sounds,This is a good CD that gets you grooving excellent Drive music with the Sun Roof open or on a long ride to a party. You will really get your juices flowing.
1,insuffiisant,"I just finished three quarters of French with this pseudo-text in a high school adult education course. The teacher is a Suisse lady and a gem, but the book is wholly inadequate even as a superficial introduction. The book proves that language is NEITHER fast nor fun. Only the present tense is introduced. The sunbjunctive and some idiomatic expressions are dropped into the text and then left unexplained. Worse yet, the vocabulary is designed for serious [i.e., fabulously rich] shoppers. You will learn such expressions in Frech as ""a ring without a setting"" and ""pendent earrings"" and how to get your watch fixed, but you will never carry on a simple conversation with a French speaking person. Quel dommage! Get a real textbook or if you can get help on pronunciation, a do-it-yourself book like Adrianne's old ""French in 32 Lessons"" or Berlitz."
5,Excellent,"This book/ audio cassette tape is an awesome start to learning french, one of the best ways I've found so far out there. It actually takes the time to explain to you how to make your own sentences, so you'll actually be able to speak the language. YOu also learn the grammar easy, without too much memorization or confusion. Works great with me."
1,Quelle Disappointment !,"Not worth the price! The tapes are not always correlated with the text (not updated with the book's revision). The pitiful dictionary omits basic words but includes arcane menu items. The tapes' speakers garble the phrases and do not include enough short phrases reachable by positioning the tape. The illustrations (undecipherable cartoons) don't adequately identify the word. Despite my four years of French in high school and college and time in France, I found the tapes incomprehensible most of the time and can't imagine how a newcomer to the language could benefit at all from this course."
5,wow,this is a great book to learning french try also berlitz self teacher and french made simple and the complete idiots guide to learning french bonne chance
4,"Excellent Illustrations, wide coverage","Very useful for a starter. Filled with pictures to help learning. Contains day-to-day usage phrases, commonly used sentences and special coverage of situations. It has an activity kit that has puzzles, qizzes and maps."
3,"looks nice, not the best quality.","The ring actually looks nice, but the picture is a little misleading. The whole back of the ring is hollow. Overall, the ring weighs about as much as a ring that you would get in a quarter machine. I can't see how the price can be anywhere over 200 dollars. I'm considering returning this."
5,Compassionate & Vibrant,"As always Caron brings honesty, compassion, truth and feeling to her songs. Her lyrics take you to places that you want to be, have been and some that you don't want to go back to. Always moving, touching, inspiring and with insight that cuts to the bone you yearn for more."
3,"Good starting point, but...","The lens is a bit better than the kit lenses from Canon, it has a nice finish, includes the hood, and a metal mount. On the other hand the image quality is Ok for amateur use, but if you care about image quality; the lens will disappoint you.Even if the focus is spot on, and you're using a tripod the lens is very soft. The colors and contrast cannot be compared to other more expensive lenses.So overall, better than the kit lens, but don't expect great pics from this lens."
3,Decent glass for the price,"I've had this lens and used it for about 18 months. It served the purpose of a walkaround lens, since it had a decent wide angle end (18mm x1.6 for the APS-C sized sensor on my camera), and a decent 50mm normal range (again x1.6). I eventually replaced it with the Canon 24-70mm mostly for the low-light performance and faster focusing (f/2.8 vs f/3.5-5.6). The photos I took with it were decent, only a little bit of distortion on the wide end, and no noticeable CA."
1,Disappointed,"I bought this video for my daughter because she loves Mia Hamm. She was doing a project at school on her and wanted to see her play. So I searched Mia Hamm on Amazon and this is one of the videos that came up. I was suprised and very disappointed to find out that even thought it said on the website and on the back of the box quote, ""North Carolina team lead by Mia Hamm"", that she was not playing or was even mention the entire time. I don't know if she was out for injury or what the deal was, but I feal if I search your website for Mia Hamm and she was not playing in this game it should have been noted. I ordered another documentary and was very happy with that purchase."
1,Too many errors in information to make it enjoyable.,"There are too many errors in the ""facts"" of this story to list, so I'll just point out the one that bothers me the most. The 99th division did not capture the Ludendorff bridge at Remagen as indicated in this book. The 9th Armored along with 78th division captured the bridge and established the bridge head. Even rudimentary research would have revealed this fact. So when an author can't get the obvious correct, it calls into question every statement in the book. If you can't or won't do the research on WWII... then don't write about it. My father fought at the Ludendorff bridge, and you do a great dis-service to the men who where there and gave their lives when you mis-state the facts of the battles."
5,A Great Read,"I'm usually more of a fiction reader, but this was a page turner. My own grandfather fought in the battle of the bulge and I found the story filled in a lot of holes in my understanding of the historic battle. A very heroic tale, sad and yet triumphant, I couldn't put it down.The only fault I could possibly find with it is the authors repeated attempts to drive home how heroic everything was. Yes, it was an amazing and heroic effort by a platoon outnumbered at times 20 to 1, but he could have stopped trying to build this up in the readers minds. I think we get it. These men did something amazing."
2,Disappointing............,"The Longest Winter maybe a worthwhile book in that it tells the story of some brave men that served their country honourably. The reality of the book is that this small units brief 24 hours of combat forces the author to focus mainly on their training and subsequent post-combat POW experience. The interspersed and unrelated episodes from Hitler's bunker, Malmedy, Skorzeny, and Kampfgruppe Peiper all seem like filler to pad out a book in desperate need of content. Really does the recounting of Adolf Hitler and Eva Braun's last hours have any bearing on this platoon's story?"
4,Great book,"I was engrossed in this book. I couldn't wait to get home from work to read it. I have never been a WWII buff and I picked this book up on a lark because it was on a buy 3 for 2 sale rack. The sacrifice these kids make really touched my heart. WWII was a just war unlike the current Iraqi war. I am very much against the Bush war in Iraq, but this book showed me the heroism of two generations ago. I wonder if our youth today would have the integrity and courage to perform as these guys did back in 1944. These men were true heroes."
2,"Poorly written, paper-thin story","I'm afraid one must have the courage to set aside the praise of many reviewers for this book solely for patriotic reasons. While the accomplishments of this platoon may indeed be remarkable, this book isn't.Firstly, there are quite a few errors in the book, but these have been discovered by other readers as well, no need for repetition.I was also puzzled with the way the author presents the storyline. Narrative at one point, switching to thoughts on another and jumping to fabricated conversations/quotes account for an awkwardly confusing reading experience.on the content : Omitting the character descriptions only leaves a couple of pages describing the heroic acts of this platoon - a bit thin if you ask me. It's no match for Ambroses' book."
5,Incredible and inspirational; a Hollywood storyline that's true,"An incredibly detailed, yet not tedious, report on one American unit's significant contribution in turning back the final offensive of the Third Reich and surviving one of the harshest winters in modern European history. Told with ample background on all the participants, from both sides of the lines, this book is a breeze to get through and will make you buy every other book by Alex Kershaw. Well researched. Easily one of the best war books I've read in the last couple of years."
2,"Not an ""action"" book about WW2","I just read halfway into this book (page 153) and realized that the rest of it is about life in prison camps in WW2. Prior to that, it is very interesting reading about the training, coming together, going to Europe and then the one day of actual combat. It was a very important day but only one day. With a subtitle of ""WWII's Most Decorated Platoon"", I expected a lot more action."
3,"Great story, wooden writing","I was really looking forward to reading this book, but found myself disappointed with the rather flat and colorless prose style of the author. A story this dramatic deserves more intensity, more vivid storytelling - at least in my opinion."
2,Ehhhhhh,"Wasn't crazy about this DVD - it's a compilation of short comedy clips, most of which aren't really very funny. I had bought it because Sinbad was on it and his sketch was one of the few that were funny. Needless to say, it's in the ""sell back"" bag."
5,Classic Progressive Rock---One of the 70's Very Best,"Along with Masque, I believe Leftoverture to be Kansas' finest work. This compilation offers a wide variety of soundscapes and textures. If you like lush keyboards, wonderful vocal harmonies, busy-yet-tight bass lines, drumming that is technical, yet not-overdone, finely-played violin, and the vocal talents of not one but three, you cannot go wrong by purchasing Leftoverture. Those of you in your forties and fifties probably already know this. Those of you who are quite a bit younger, trust me, please."
3,Leftoverture - not quite the Point,Leftoverture starts off with a pure classic but then seems somewhat lacking for the next few tracks only picking up toward the end with the promise of things yet to come. Not as consistent as the real breakthrough down here in Oz - Point of Know Return - but still a must for any Kansas fan's library. Anyway by today's standards it's a breath of much needed fresh air for us old 70s rockers decaying away in middle age. And yes the remastering is very good!!!
3,Not just in Kansas anymore,"3 1/2While still too bombastically simplistic (and slightly derivative) to obtain classy-and-classic status through and through, Leftoverture is a solid synthesis of their personable commercial and progressive inclinations."
2,Leave It Be,"Kansas specializes in bland pop hard rock of the arena variety. If that sounds appealing to you or you love REO Speedwagon or Styx you may want this album. If you like hearing the `big' tracks on the radio, stick to a greatest hits package. Stand Out is ""Carry On Wayward Son'"
2,Ok not the best.,"The record did come before expected, which is good! However the description said playable, and it was, but the second song on the record had a scratch that makes it skip. Not very pleased with the record itself but pleased with the service! My advice? consider seller, but confirm with the seller before purchase."
5,Kansas' Leftoverture,"I've loved this release since it came out. I had it on cassette, then downloaded the songs off of Limewire, and when that crashed, I just couldn't go without it. Every song on here is just fantastic. I ordered it with the free shipping option and got it ahead of schedule, so Thank You Amazon! You have a life-long shopper from me!! (Especially since there's no sales tax included - I buy as much as possible here!)"
4,The eye-opener from America's greatest progressive band!,"Kansas has to be considered America's greatest progressive rock band. They released a few great albums before this, but this was the one that, combined with ""Point of Know Return"", put them over the top. Not only was Steve Walsh's voice amazing in it's prime, but he had possibly the greatest organ sound ever captured on rock albums! The rest of the band isn't bad either! ""Magnum Opus"" is a masterpiece! Another band who, like the entire ""Prog"" genre, gets no respect from the industry!"
5,Kansas Best - No Aguments,"This is quite simply one of rock's greatest albums.If ever a band hit a creative peak and laid down an album of classic tracks in one go then this is it. There isn't a dud or average track present and every one scores a hit.From the well known radio classic Carry On Wayward Son, Kansas most famous song, to passionate masterpieces like The Wall, the frenetic Magnum Opus and wonderful Cheyenne Anthem this album is filled from start to finish with superlative musicianship, songs, lyrics, and vocals.This is a must buy for any rock fan, not just fans of Kansas."
5,Your Own Private Weather Station,"This Oregon Scientific Projection Clock With Weather Station has been excellent and very useful. The paperwork included with the unit states that the weather predictor has about a 75% accuracy rate but I would have to swear it is 95% accurate.When rain is on the way there is an animated cloud with showering water, and when snow is predicted there are sparkling snowflakes that twinkle.The remote unit is dead on accurate. One day there was lite rain falling and it was 33 degrees out side. The moment the display changed to 32 degrees there were snowflakes gently falling.If you are interested in an indoor-outdoor remote thermometer I don't know how there could be one better than this one. And it even has an atomic clock that automatically sets itself!"
3,No te lo recomiendo,"Me siento caritativo hoy; si fuera honesto, tendría que declararlo pésimo. Aburrido, arrastra al lector por capitulos tontos, muy poco probables, y sumamente estupidos. De repente, en la mitad del libro, me quedé con las ganas de que se murieran todos, para así de una vez poder dejar de leer. Y lo mas improbable es que la mina siga esperandolo al gallego gordo, pelado, sin haberlo visto desde los '70. Por si acaso lee esto el autor, tengo que decirle: Muy poco nivel, viejo, muy poco nivel."
5,"Magic Move #4 may destroy your back, but .....","I have enjoyed the game for decades and have dozens of golf instruction books and videos in my library. It is highly unusual, in my opinion, to see much of anything that is unique and calls into question the core assumptions that are the foundation of most of these golf guides. This book is one of those rare ones that will cause you to ask some questions about what you think you know about the golf swing. I really like the Ralph Mann book ""Swing Like a Pro"", but I think I might like this one even more. Even if you do not follow the four magic moves covered in the book (I think the last one may well ensure future back problems), a reading of chapter 2 (called something like ""sweeping out the rubbish"") is worth the price of the book on its own. For me, I am going to try to firm up my grip and experiment with the author's early wrist set. Highly recommended."
3,Four Magic Moves to Winning Golf.,"Some would say it makes sense, others hmmm! Trouble is not one swing fits all!"
4,The alternative golf swing that works,"I am a golf instructor based in New Zealand and purchased the book based on what I had read on some internet sites. The book advocated an early wrist break that is not commonly taught or known about.Dan Shaugers/Mike Austin ""How to Kill the Ball"" and ""21st Century Golf Swing"" which I am an accredited teacher..... are the only other books that you will read that teach such an action with the wrists. Not only that we both teach lateral movements of the hips.If you have purchased Dan's books you will certainly enjoy reading about Joe Dante's method."
5,Best Instructional Book on the Golf Swing Ever Published,"I've read many instructional books on the golf swing. I am proof that one can greatly improve their game through books and time on the practice range. I went from a 31 to a 7.5 handicap in less than 4 years without any lessons. I credit Joe Dante with the last 6 or 7 strokes of my improvement. The Four Magic Moves reveals the ""trick"" of the golf swing. Ever see a card trick or a magician act and wonder how the heck it was done. If the ""trick"" is revealed to you, its then obvious why it worked out. The Four Magic Moves is the only book out there that reveals the trick! If you are not already aware of this trick, it will have a dramatic effect on your game!"
1,Not Good,"Animation is a lot of work. If you're not up to it (as the creators of this cartoon) you can just pan the camera around static pictures and make minimal bits of the scene change when absolutely necessary. And if you do go to all that effort to draw a few cels, doggone it, you're going to loop them for all they're worth. The colors also seem washed out -- nothing like the vibrant picture on the box. The picture quality and sound are poorer than what you'd expect from VHS, let alone DVD. The music seemed irrelevant.But all this I could easily forgive if it told the story well. Unfortunately, the pacing is horrible, the plot is obscure unless you already know the story, and it is devoid of any real emotion -- either from the characters or the viewer. Wait until your kids are older and give them the book instead."
5,The Best of The Best,"Puffy Amiyumi is a great band. But, if you want to get their best cd, this is the one to get. This CD really showcase Puffy Amiyumi's diverse collection of songs.It is a must-have for any puffy amiyumi fan.Note: ""Cake is Love"" is the BEST song is this CD; this song really stands out from the rest. I can listen to it over and over again!"
3,Collection of Occidental styles,"Most songs in this album show heavy Occidental influence. The most notorious are:1. Jet Keisatsu:Led Zeppelin.2. Korega Watashi No Ikirumichi:The Beatles3. Cake Is Love:Stevie Wonder6. Lemon Kid:Did you watch ""Who framed Rogger Rabitt?"" Remember the song Roger's wife sung?7. ShoubijinIf you've heard Ozy Osbourne's ""Center of Eternity"", Pink Floyd's ""Interestellar Overdrive"", ""Atom Heart Mother"", ""The Trial"", and ""High Hopes"", you'll recognize the influences.9. TetsugakuAgain, this really reminds me of Pink Floyd's ""Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast""10. Puffy de Rio:Sounds like Mexican teenage soap opera music... With a little bit from Eric Clapton12. Nagisa Ni Matsuwaru EtcPure Disco!13. MotherHas a certain Byrds' ""Turn! Turn! Turn!"" feel..."
4,Daring Adventure and Drama,"Some friends loaned us their DVDs of Horatio, and we were hooked. These episodes are full of adventure and drama. Best if watched in sequence--lays the foundation. The acting is excellent in my opinion, but there are a few gorey scenes that might be too much if you tend to be very strict with what your children watch. In the later episodes there are very slight sensual comments, etc., but most children would miss it. Overall, it's clean and good watching."
4,It's okay.,"Like other reviewers said, this item is not as pictured. It DOES NOT have a large rotary knob, just a little bar for a knob. It works like it's supposed to work and you need one if you plan to use 12oz cans of R134A refrigerant with your manifold gauges. If I had it to do over again, I'd probably purchase the version with the rotary knob. Just my opinion."
3,Not as the pic showed,"The picture shows this with a reg round spigot handle but when we received it, it has a T-Handle on it. I'm not sure it will matter but I still don't like getting something different than what you order. The pictures need to be correct because we would not have ordered the one we received had we known what it really looked like."
4,this one looks like it has quality,i had to choose between a cheaper torque wrench and this one and i decided to get this on. i think i made the right choice though a bit high priced i have learned that buy the best tools you can afford. this one looks like it will last
5,Worth the Money,I've used this item multiple times on my KLR650. It is a quality product and worth the money. The numbers are small but still easy to read (unlike the cheaper HF torque wrenches that appear blurry).
4,REGULAR SHIPPING TIME FROM PURCHASE SATISFACTORY,Excellent movie. BRIGITTE FONDA'S ONE OF HER GREATEST PERFORMANCE. ALL THE OTHER CHARACTERS WAS INCHARACTER. HARVEY KEITEL PERFORMANCE WAS REALISTIC
4,Great design kinda lasts long time,It fully work for a short bit like a few weeks or a few months (i forget) but then I had to tilt the LifeDrive to get it to charge... but its been working for a long time its been a few years sure I dont use it every day but that still along time :P even tho I have to tilt it to charge :D
4,my opinion,"the delivery was on time. there were some added stuff that was in the box. i really appreciate that, and the disc is brand new. many dvds that say that were new do have scratches. thanks again."
5,TENSION FILLED READING,"For those who like their thrills laced with military action here is vintage Dale Brown. A former U.S. Air Force Captain who knows his subject well, Brown is recognized for his adroit delivery. Reprising his hero in former works, Patrick McLanahan, the author puts him in the thick of it immediately - leading a squadron of B-1 bombers into combat over Korea.The fragile Asian peace has been placed in jeopardy. Descriptions of weaponry and flying tactics abound, as is routine for Brown. If techno-thrillers are your meat - here's a hearty helping. Reader Purdham is especially convincing in relating an aerial dogfight - he renders the melee succinctly and suspensefully.- Gail Cooke"
5,Brown at his Best,"He knows how to grab the readers attention with his high tech and unbelievable weapons and yet makes them so realalistic. It makes you think ""hey, maybe that is possible."""
1,Battle Boring,"I have always been a fan of techno/military novels from The Cruel Sea to Kilo Class, but this one just left me cold. I've read a couple of books by this author and found some of the early ones quite entertaining. Things have gone downhill. Each successive book is a flawed clone of its predecessor, and this one reached new lows in character development and plot. I got half way through the book and found I didn't like a single character in it and didn't care about the outcome. This is the first book that I have not wanted to read to completion in about 5 years"
2,Battle Born,"Really lame and not worth the price!!! Exciting beginning with in depth detail of combat flying. The moment it leaves that and goes to geopolitical and military, the realism leaves completely. The basis for the story sounded intriging, but was not addressed in such a manner as to make it even remotely believable. It is a shame. It started so well."
2,Did I read the same book as everyone else?,"I hate to say it, but I found this book painfully SLOW. Yes, the plot moved along smartly, but not in a way that I cared about. The primary conflict doesn't arise until quite late in the book and our ""heros"", and I use the term loosley because I care not a whit about the charaters Mr. Brown created, see no real action until VERY late in the book. For my taste, he spent FAR too much time setting up the scenario and not enough time making me care about the characters. Tin Man, while admittedly hokey, at least saw the main character actively involved in fighting the bad guys from an early chapter. I struggled to finish Battle Born."
1,a battle to read,I have read all of Dale Brown's books. I could not finish Battle Born. I was bored and found myself skipping paragraphs and indeed pages to the point where I quit. I was very disappointed in this book and will hesitate to buy another by this author.
1,wal-mart special,"this book is typical of the soft covers wal-mart sells and my wife brings home. this time i was with her and it still didn't help. there was a lot of factual? material and much speculation, seeing that i have newer been invited to groom lake. it is just not well done, i tended to skip some of the junk but i read the whole dreary book."
1,Battle Born,Dale Browns first book was Flight of the Old Dog. This book is an old dog. There are numerous dead spots in this. Mr. Brown really needs to find himself a new editor. The pacing is terrible. The conversations go on forever and the action is too drawn out. The concept of a multirole fighter bomber is very unique and interesting. The problem is the characters that fly this plane are very troubled people. You almost hope they get shot down by the North Koreans. Reading this book is alot worse than watching an episode of Jag. There are plenty of better military type books available.
1,Disappointing - Dale needs a rest.,"Despite perfect print and excellent cover of a european paperback edition the contents of Dale's latest are dissappointing.Battle Born lacks typical Dale's dramaturgy and is a pure techno-gizmo that is absolutely boring nor entertaining. It looks like Dale was bound to produce something by a certain date (by a contract, for example) and that was what he did.Wasted money and time."
5,"""Battle Born"" - Flight of the NEW Dog!","Unlike some, I wasn't too disappointed with Dale Brown's last book, ""The Tin Man"", I kind of enjoyed it in a Robocop kind of way. Besides, Dale showed guts in trying something different.But now ""Battle Born"". This is what I've been waiting for. Fast paced, fast flying, missiles firing action of the sort that Brown does best. While I'm not going to say if this is his best book yet (I'll have to re-read the previous 11 books and decide), it will grip you, haul you in and refuse to let you put it down until you finish the last page. The politics are not too far-fetched, the technology may well exist already and his characterisations are as good as ever. This book could be seen as a true sequel to Flight of The Old Dog, finally retiring the EB-52 with the introduction of the... nah, you'll have to read it to find out. When's the next one coming out? If it's better than ""Battle Born"", Amazon better change its top rating to TEN stars."
2,Armegeddon as Soap Opera,"If you prefer your tales of blood and slaughter served up with plenty of jaw-jutting angst, this book is for you. Dale Brown is to be saluted for getting this into print. I wouldn't publish it. The heros are monodimensionally combative with everyone, even each other. There's plenty of bombastic machismo dialogue. Still, the audio version is great for washing dishes. You can miss whole chapters while vacuuming and still follow the plot. And we get to focus on radio-transimitting microchips while thousands fry as the tactical nuclear weapons fly. Doesn't get any better than this for dissassociated mayhem. But hey, I listened to all of it, didn't I?"
1,Fizzle,"I've loved Dale Brown's previous books, mainly because of the incredible detail he puts into the flying parts - it almost feels like I'm in the cockpit. But this one spent so much time setting up the political situation, that when it come to the flying scenes, it's all done in about 10 pages at the end.On its own, it is fairly decent. But as part of the Patrick McLanahan saga, this one bombs."
1,He started downhill with Hammerhead and is still going down,"I hate to be a majority of one, with all those 5 star reviews, but this is another Hammerhead, Tinman weak book. He overwhelms the reader with nonsense technology, impossible flying and unbelieveable characters. The book has no real plot just a lot of incidents that, in some cases combine and in most don't. Things just don't happen this way in real life. I have read every one of Dale Brown's books, The Flight of the Old Dog, got me. This is my last. It's too bad he has never lived up to that start . You just keep waiting for this book to make sense and it does not."
3,HAWKING SMART CARD READER,"Unit does what it is suppose to do.For XP users forget about installing CD,this is a plug and play item.Pictures show up almost immediately.Great item highly recommend for Smart Card Olympus users."
5,worth the price,"the scales and modes learn are worth the price alone,to get inside the mind of a bass great is icing on the cake..."
4,Great Scent,"This Cologne is great the scent is not heavy, a slightly woody scent. I highly recommend it. The scent stays through out the day."
4,WONDERFUL for the self-taught designer!,"i've always had a natural talent for composition and design, but lack the formal training in that dicipline. this book is wonderful because it allows you to grow as a designer by taking you on voyage inside the creative process of some of the country's leading firms. why was one logo chosen over another? how did the design firm successfully interpret and execute the needs of the client? why was a certain symbol chosen for a logo? and most important how to make a good design an awesome design. wonderful, large full-color photographs of before and after the makeover really bring the point home and help you see for yourself. you can't help but come away with ideas on how to improve the designs you work with everyday. great price too!"
4,Review,A good pamphlet if your planning the trip. It provides a good deal of useful information on routes and places to stay. It would be great if the pamphlet was updated as I'm sure there have been changes since 1999.
4,Lnking up the GAP and C&O Towpath,This is a solid resource for those planning to travel this outstanding trail. I've traveled several sections in preparation for going the full 300+ miles. Not hugely detailed but it does contain very practical information that will help in deciding if this kind of trip is for you.
2,not recommended,"this book is written by someone who could not wait to write a review today. The plot is foreshadowing with a thud. One is never surprised at what happens next except one knows that nothing will go really wrong for these characters as they are made of cotton candy. think of it....run away from home with your family to a muli-million dollar beach house with a 'hunk' who delivers anything you want or need. OYE! such wish fulfillment, so predictable."
3,What coast are we on??,"This was an enjoyable read for a long airplane ride. The fact that it was set in an area, South Carolina, and I plan to visit there this fall was another draw.Where was the editing for this novel??? From the very first page, ""It was twilight and a brilliant red sun lazily made its hazy descent off the South Carolina Coast"" to p.407, ""Cara stood on the small dune watching the sun dip into the Atlantic"" someone missed the boat. The last time I looked, South Carolina was on the east coast and even this evening the sun set in the west. I think this is a major flaw in an otherwise engaging book."
5,great book,Such a joy to read. I love the style that she writes with and this is definitely one of my favorite books. I love the area the story is set in too!!!
5,The Beach House bu Mary Alice Monroe,"The Beach House, by Mary Alice Monroe, is a beautiful account of the life of Lovey Rutledge, a woman who lives alone in a small house on the eastern shore. Ms Rutledge cares for Loggerhead sea turtles and their hatchlings. Her life and the entertwined lives of these beautiful turtles show us how precious life is to us and to those creatures that live in the ocean. It is well written and worth reading for adults and to read to children. I plan to read everything Mary Alice Monroe has written, after reading this beautiful story."
3,Well written but boring,"This book is an easy summer read, very well written, with an interesting theme of the loggerhead turtles. However, I found the story itself very uninteresting, nothing beyond what most of us have in our own families."
3,Okay,"I thought this book was okay. Did not care for Cara's personality too much. I understand the book was more about Cara and her mom, but I would have liked to read more about her and Brett. I will attempt to read the follow up book to this story - Swimming Lessons."
5,Great for turtle ladies,"Great book. The title gave no clue as to the extent sea turtles were woven into the story. Being a ""turtle lady"" myself, this book was extra special awesome."
2,Too Depressing,"I'm not sure why writers constantly include someone dying of cancer in their novels. Why would ANYONE want to read about that? Please tell me. Well, this book tops them all as the main character ""Lovie"" is dying from cancer from the first few pages of the book until the inevitable sad ending. Of course, we learn to really like her character, which I did, just to make sure you are really, really sad when the ending comes and to make sure you are completely depressed throughout the rest of the book. The novel also includes the pre-requisite philandering husband, abusive boyfriend, and lonely hunk who finally finds love. No surprises here at all. The information about the turtles was very interesting but sad as well as we learn with all the effort the ""Turtle Ladies"" give to saving the turtle eggs, most of them die anyway. Depressing."
5,The Beach House,Love this book can't put down from the very beginning if you like the beach you will love this book
4,Wonderful!,"This is not at all my usual type of book, but I added it to my Kindle shelf just for some variety. I loved it!!! Wonderful story."
5,"Fantastic, timeless story","I read The Beach House years ago, and left my paperback copy at my parent's place. Thankfully I found it for my Kindle and had the pleasure of re-reading it. The characters and their relationships are colorful and profound. I recommend it to anyone who loves the coast and its natural beauty, and knows the joys and sorrows of loving their family through all of life's ups and downs."
5,Such an emotionally moving book!,"I loved this book. I had never read any of Mary Alice Monroe's work, but I was moved by this book. Read this book, you won't be able to put it down. It was completely satisfying start to finish!"
2,Disappointed,"The premise seemed really good and reviews seemed good also. But, I did not know there would be soooo much about loggerhead turtles- which I have absolutely no interest in. It was hard to stay focused on any story line the author was trying to weave in between the turtle track hunts, etc. I just found it boring and gave up 40% the way through it."
4,Extended Vacation,"During my visit to Isle of Palms I heard about this book and ordered it from Amazon.com. The book captures the spirit of the island with the ""turtle team"", eco-tours (Caper Island does exist and is as beautiful as described in the book) and island goings. I read this after my vacation and I felt like I was back on the island. Read the book in one sitting. There's a good love story that bought tears to my eyes!"
5,Total Goldsmith,"The composer's best score in nearly a decade, better than Mulan, as fully engaged as Basic Instinct as it plays to Goldsmith's strengths as a specialist in infiltrating dangerous territory. Some will compare to Wind and the Lion for the Arabic scales but this has less to do with that accomplishment than with Goldsmith's hard edged gritty Western sound for Rio Conchos or Take a Hard Ride, just pared down a little and given a contemporary classical exposition (clean lines, less ornamentation). This is the perfect score for the Crichton original, presenting a memorable theme with a strong low melody, and some of Goldsmith's classiest action writing this side of Roxy Loses from Basic Instinct. This one's perfectly structured and chiselled as a dramatic score. A lean classic."
4,Enjoyed,"Enjoyed this CD, but not as intense as I'd expected. Rather surprised since I enjoyed the movie so much. However, definitely one to enjoy repeatedly!"
5,Thrilling!,"Jerry Goldsmith is undeniably one of the greatest film composers there has ever been! I love his thrilling, action-packed and inspiring music in films such as ""The Edge"" and ""L.A. Confidential."" Here has creates a thrilling masterpiece which has some great Arabic tunes. It's some of the best music for a film that I have heard all year! He adds spice to every action scene and makes the movie all the more thrilling and exciting. ""The 13th Warrior"" isn't a ""great"" film, but the music makes it a better film."
1,JUST DON'T GET IT FROM IMPORTCDS,"This is a great soundtrack to a very good movie; just be careful who you buy it from. I ordered 1 copy from a seller called IMPORTCDS. They billed me for & shipped 3 copies. When I contacted them about the error they assured me that as long as I returned the extra 2 copies that they would issue a full refund on all but what I had originally ordered. Over 2 weeks later, I actually got a refund for 1 copy; I've still paid for the 2nd as well as their shipping charge to send me the 2 copies I never wanted in the 1st place. Customer service this is not. DO NOT BUY FROM IMPORTCDS !!!"
3,13th warrior,"Moody, symphonic passages. Some nice melodies but mostly music you would expect from an intense adventure film.definitly not easy background or quiet time music."
2,More examples please,"I, an engineer turned marketer, love to learn by example. Stop telling me about how it works...show me.THE COMPLETE LACK OF SAMPLES was very disappointing. I feel my understanding would have been much deeper if the author had walked through hypothetical/real examples.The book does a reasonably good job describing the various steps of performing the QFD process. Samples would have made it much richer."
5,A great overview of literary trial by translation.,"This book is not only the best haiku bargain for the buck, but a valuable snapshot of the trials and tribulations any literature is likely to go through in the translation process. Bowers has given the reader a semester's worth of translation styles and problems to consider. Anyone interested in the problems of translation, or in taking on the translation of haiku, can learn from this book. Also, anyone attempting to review the literature on haiku in English should probably start here, for it gives sample translation from virtually every serious book on the subject in or out of print at the time of compilation (1996). Bowers knows his stuff, and his Japanese, and contributes some very fine translations occasionally himself.You couldn't go wrong on this for a first book of haiku!"
4,An interesting collection of haiku,"This volume has several characteristics to recommend it: (1) it provides a transliteration of the Japanese to give the reader a sense of the sound of haiku (2) several times it provides multiple translations of a haiku, giving the reader a sense of the different approaches to translation (3) it provides a collection that is a cross-section of haiku throughout its Japanese history rather than concentrating on the best known.It has some negatives - too many footnotes that could have been handled in a less intrusive manner such as who is the student of whom or what is the best known haiku of the author. The willingness to use footnotes allows the editor to direct the reader's response in a positive way.If you have any interest in haiku, you will want this volume in your collection."
5,Name Me Something Else A Buck Can Get You That Brings So Much With It,"Dover Thrift Editions are a wonderful idea. For between a dollar and two dollars each, someone can own the greatest works of human literature, philosophy, history, and poetry. Spectacular concept!In this volume, five centuries of Japanese haiku as composed by some of the genre's greatest masters is translated and compiled. This works as either an introduction to these ""written snapshots"" or makes a nice addtion to the library of a haiku fan."
4,Invasion of the Body Snatchers Blu ray review,"I would like to talk about the Blu ray product and not the movie. I liked the picture and sound quality on Blu ray. Even though this is a very dark movie, they did a decent job with the transfer. There are several featurettes on the Extra menu all of which are pretty good. I would have given this edition 5 star if it wasn't for the fact that director Phillip Kaufman's commentary is on the regular DVD and not on the Blu ray disc. This is my only criticism. I think they should have included the director's commentary also on the Blu ray disc. I think they made the wrong choice."
2,"Great Movie, Terrible DVD","This is one of the great remakes -- a remake that actually doesn't just rehash the original. It takes the same premise in a different direction. And it has a 70s apocalyptic character -- edgy and just a little depressing. The original and this remake really reflect their times.So the movie is fantastic. This DVD is one of the worst I've seen (I have a few hundred DVDs). The compression is terrible -- tons of artifacts indicating severe over-compression badly done. The ""letterbox"" version is not true letterboxing and is also hideously bad.So it's six of one, half a dozen of the other. If the price is low enough, probably worth having because the film is so good."
4,Report from the widescreen police,"The film itself is an excellent translation of the original story to a setting which would mean more to its contemporary audience. Nobody believed, by 1978, that America ""lived"" in its small towns - so the decision to move the setting to a big city, and to make the IBS a tale of urban paranoia is an excellent move. Characters are fully developed and lively; special effects are great fun. The pace is a good deal slower than that of the 1956 original, but the greater visual interest perhaps makes up for the occasional slownesses.ALERT: the ""widescreen"" side of the DVD presents an image which is, in fact, wider than the ""fullscreen"" image, but it is also shorter top-to-bottom. Why do these clowns feel obliged to do this? Why are we putting up with it? Can it really be cheaper to produce? Or do they just think we're too oblivious to notice? (As most of us probably are.)"
3,"A Clasic, doesn't always age Well","While I loved the original when it was originally released I was disappointed in this purchase. I don't think it ages perticularly well. It wasn't the best choice.Some films age better than others. Of course the film still works on many levels, it's just not the class I recall from back when."
3,Invasion Of the Body Snatchers-1978,"Growing up, Seeing this Film,which was/is Creepy as Hell, and Gross. Although I don't think I have seen the Original, This movie is good,long but good, I hate the Ending, I could care less for the Republican putdown. The movie is eerie considering there are many obamabots who are mindlessly in love with a empty suit, So while I am not a Huge Sci Fi Fan per se,more horror really.The movie is similar to what is going on today and the sick cult like worship of celebs.the acting is good.Funny it happen in SF."
3,Give 3 stars but...,"This movie was not my style but!Honestly, this wasn't very exciting movie. I was bored and none of main characters wasn't impressing. Since I am living in SF, to see my city in the movie was fun (althoght SF becoming the ground zero isn't very pleasing but I am pretty sure the same thing should have happened all around the world at the same time instead of sending out pod to the other city). OK, I don't like this movie at all but? This movie let me know one thing. What I have been thinking normal, safe, reliable or permenant...can be changed so easily (really). So, this movie will be kept in my memory. BTW, would they be happy? Can we be sure which life would be better? I just wish this move was made in different way."
2,Good,"The remake of the absolutely wonderful remake livelier, faster paced, and relatively lame. The Directors shows off behind the camera with obtrusive camera angles, and the ending is an insult. The acting is excellent, though."
5,A wonderfully creepy movie...,"I've always been fascinated by the 1978 version of ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers."" Its theme, the loss of humanity, is presented with subtlety and great intensity, through the sound design, the acting, the music, the photography, and the special effects. So this new DVD is really a treasure. It has excellent picture and sound quality, a great trailer, and a very informative and insightful commentary by the director, Philip Kaufman. This is an epic movie about one of the 20th century's greatest tragedies: the systematic, deliberate conversion of humanity into drones. As such, it is mostly serious in tone, but it does have many moments of quirkiness. Highly recommended!"
5,As Good As If Not Better Than the Original,"Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978) is a remarkable movie. It is comparable to and in some cases far exceeds the originalInvasion of the Body Snatchersfilm. The cast all give great performances led by Donald Sutherland and Jeff Goldblum. A movie that will terrify you. One of the best horror movies I've seen.This new Two Disc set includes a commentary by the director Philip Kaufman, and a few new featurettes. Also included is the original theatrical trailer.Highly recommended."
3,Only One Complaint,"While a bargain at the price, my only question is why make a Collector's multi-disc set and not include 5.1 sound?"
4,Outstanding movie,"This is the first movie about the pods and how they change you, the pods are found in a ponds. Donald Sutherland is great."
5,Bone-chilling,"This movie is brilliantly crafted, thematically profound, and will scare the [stuff] out of you. Kaufman fell off his game in the Nineties, in my opinion, but nothing can ever diminish his accomplishment with this classic."
4,A very good remake; collector's edition is sweet,"As other reviewers have noted, this is an excellent remake of the 1956 original, with superb casting, great performances, excellent direction and cinematography. Veronica Cartwright and Jeff Goldblum (and Spock - Leonard Nimoy!) are very good in supporting roles. Cartwright in particular is just excellent (see her also in ""Alien""). And Sutherland and Adams give believable, sympathetic performances in the leads. The scene towards the end when ""Amazing Grace"" starts playing on bagpipes along the waterfront... well, suffice to say it's tremendously effective and emotional. This film speaks volumes about the evils of social pressure and conformity, while managing to scare the be-jeezus out of most viewers. Definitely worth having in your collection of sci/fi DVDs! I'll leave you with one final line from the film: ""It eez a caper!"" ""No, it's a rat turd!"" :-)"
3,"Okay, but a bit weak.","This used to be one of my favorite teas. But,now, it seems very weak in flavor. I think it is a tad pricey to have to use two tea bags for a cup of tea."
5,preacherman,Great service. My order arrived very quickly and in good condition. I found the cloak to be much heavier than expected and of a superior quality.
5,Beautiful Expensive Looking,"This is quite nice expensive looking cape.It has slits on the sides for arms if desired - they are placed slightly back of where I would expect them to be and work but not extremely well. I chose not to use them, and you can't really see them unless you look for them.The hood is lined, the entire product is very high quality for what you pay for it.I'm 5'9"" and a bit plump and the cape came down to my mid calf. Very nicely done, very classy. I would definitely purchase again. I wore to Halloween party and again to a 14 hour marathon Twilight screening- very comfortable and somewhat warm too! I would definitely buy again."
5,HillL,"Like another reviewer I was leery about ordering this cloak because of the ""cheap"" price, but was in a bind and needed one ASAP. I was very pleasantly surprised when I recieved it. It worked perfect as a cover-up and I recieved several compliments on it. Great product for the price."
3,Not as Described,"While this ""ok"" cloak, it is not as described or pictured. The picture, as well as other reviews, indicated that this cape had concealed arm slits. Since I will be tending bar the night of the event it was purchased for, I needed the arm slits in order to be able to work freely. However, the cape does not have any slits for your arms to go through the cape. In addition, it is described as being 52 inches in length, but the one I received was much longer. I am 5'4 inches tall, and this cape drags the ground, leaving about 3-4 inches of additional fabric on the floor.I would not order this product again. I considered sending it back, but the seller's rules are so restrictive, it doesn't seem worth the effort.I am very disappointed with this purchase."
3,Black Velvet Cloak... with a collar,"I very nice cloak but I am afraid it has to go back. Because the product image does not show the back view you can't see that the cloak has 6 in collar that goes all around your shoulders. If you don't wear the hood, then this collar is covered by the hood and everything looks fine. If you do put on the hood, the collar rests and sticks out on your shoulders and to me that just feels very weird. Otherwise this cloak is very solid, surprisingly heavy too. On 5'3 frame it just rests on the floor. If the collar doesn't bother you, then get this cloak, this is a great deal."
3,Nice full look to this cloak with pretty crushed velvet.,"I used this for Halloween. It is very dark green and quite full with arm holes to allow movement. I am a fairly large person and 5'6 but it was big enough to fit over other clothes and allow a swirly movement. It hit at about my ankles. My very short and tiny daughter also wore it successfully on her tiny, 5'1"" frame and it just touched the floor. So a good buy for the money."
5,Ray Ban Mens Sports sunglasses,"Purchased these for my husband for xmas to replace a pair he lost in the ocean. He LOVES them. They are sturdy, comfortable, sporty and come with a hard case."
1,sunglasses,"I purchased sunglasses which were suppose to be polarized, but they weren't. I sent them back to the seller who returned the money to my account. The seller tested them and agreed they were not polarized. I am waiting on the return postage money to be credited to my account."
3,Ok but not great.,"Comparing to my Bolle Kickbacks TNS Grey Polarized, these aren't as nice. The frame doesn't have nice rubber inserts at the back to grip my head, so it relies on force more than anything. They will give me a headache after extended wearing I suspect.The nose frame isn't adjustable, but it is a nice rubber, just about right for my nose size as well.The frame's are very flexible so that's a plus over my Bolle's.The lenses are a bit darker which is nice, though they are more blueish tinted vs gray, just barely though. The outside appearance is actually a darker grey, go figure.I really don't like framed glasses, I notice the plastic along the top, I'll get used to it but the frame-less style is much preferred. I hope these will last longer than my previous two pair of Bolle's, which both cracked on the lens' due to the frame-less nature.Compared to the Kickbacks, not worth the money in my opinion. If they last a LOT longer they may be worth it. We'll see."
4,great book,"Great book - just be ready to get hold of some other books to fill in the details. If you're not entirely comfortable with the stuff in chapter 0 concerning modules (projectivity, injectivity), tor and ext, and homology from topology, maybe find a quick introduction to these elsewhere - while its certainly possible to learn about these things from chapter 0 of this book, it's not exactly the most painless way to do it. It was my first book on the subject, then I got Miller and Sturmfels: it would make more sense to reverse that order. Better still, get both simultaneously, and when the Stanley becomes a bit dense refer to M+S. I really loved this book, but it was damn hard at times!"
4,This is a research monograph!,"For those looking for a thorough introduction to the theory in this book, I would suggest a look at Miller and Sturmfels recent book on combinatorial commutative algebra or the book on Cohen-Macaulay rings by Bruns and Herzog. This is a great book, but I don't think it was intended as a beginners first book . Instead its style concentrates on presenting results found in research-articles ( prior to this book, there doesn't seem to have been any texts giving an overview of the theory ). It is great for looking up results, reading the needed prerequisites without going into details and finding important references."
2,Good for the first ten minutes...,I bought this bag in hopes that it will make traveling with a one year old slightly easier. This bag was ok to start and fit my britax (a feat in itself) BUT 10 minutes into carrying it into the airport it BROKE. I would not buy it. I emailed the company and have yet to hear back.
5,works great,"You can really press down the stinger roadkill product with this tool. Not sure what I will do with it afterwards, but I'll keep it in my tool box for future use."
5,Excellent roller saved the day,"I purchased this roller to install sound deadening tar mats on several cars and it worked out great. The roller rubber material and size allows it to mold around uneven surfaces, and the handle (also rubber) allows for a good grip and fits larger hands. If you are installing tar mats (Dynamat, FatMat, etc) do yourself a favor and get this roller."
5,"Marshalltown 2"" Flat Roller","I purchased this roller because it had good reviews and is made in the USA. I use it when I re-wrap drum sets (e.g. musical instrument drums) to help complete the bond between the wood shell and the laminate. The tool works very well, is easy to hold, and is nicely made."
4,Horrible Harry Goes To The Moon,"Harry, the main character, is in the third grade. His class is studying about the moon. Harry finds a used telescope that is for sale and his class decides to raise the money to buy the telescope. Once they raise enough money they are going to have a moonwatch. Harry has a surprise for everyone. Harry helps his classmates feel like they have really been to the moon by using his imagination.This book could be used in the classroom during a science class or with a math class. The book also teaches social skills. The class learns to work together to accomplish a common goal.This book was extremely entertaining. I was able to get my 8 year-old son to read it and it is hard to get him to read anything. Harry shows that by using you imagination you can do anything you put your mind to."
5,I think you shouud read thi book,Because they go to the moon (really it's their purple couch). It tells you how to earn money to buy a telescope to look at the moon. I liked it when Harry came dressed in a space suit. Horrible Harry books are awesome!!!!!!! By Mitchell 8
5,"I don't care if you know it, I loved this movie","This movie was amazing. I was at home on winter break from college when I saw it on TV. I watched it because I had nothing to do, but I have to say it was one of the best movies ever. I'll admit it, it is the first time since I was a really small boy and saw 'my girl' that I have almost shed a tear while watching a movie. I suggest purchasing two copies of this movie in case one copy becomes scratched when you want to watch it. I also suggest purchasing Haagan Daaz ice cream to intensify the movie watching experience. Watch this movie and then email me, we will discuss, kleenex in hand."
5,A True Classic,"A truly great movie that I have watched over and over again, both with and without my own children. What I liked most about just watching the movie was the way it blended visually rich scenes with charming and sometimes hauntingly beautiful music that literally sent shivers down my spine. The cinematography was so carefully and skillfully done that at times one seemed to almost be transported back in time, into the movie itself. What I wanted most to say about the movie is that it is a good one for children who have experienced the loss of a parent in their lives. There is a scene where Sara seems to have lost almost everything, and has no one left in the world to care about her. Then in the morning, the window blows open and she is inspired to dance in the falling snow, seeming to realize that life still is worth living. To me that was one of the most powerful, moving, and uplifting scenes I think I've ever seen in a movie."
1,What Happened?,"Since ""The Secret Garden"" was done rather well (some changes) I expected that this film would mostly follow the book. If the author is good why make huge changes? Wow, what a miss this film is! In the book Sarah Crewe was a princess because of her strength of character. In the movie she was a princess in the Disneyish way of being a female of a certain age.Besides that the worst change was removing the scene at the bakery in which Sarah gave away most of the buns she had purchased to a girl who was hungrier than she was. Very important in the book, left out of the movie!I have 5 children (all grown now) but because of this I read a lot of children's book and saw a lot of children's movies. The book is very strong, required reading. The movie is not worth a view."
2,Completely different from the book,"This film is lovely to look at and well acted, but the script has little in common with Frances Hodgson Burnett's story. The location has been moved from London to New York, the characters are poorly developed--if developed at all, and there are many, many departures from the original book. Being a huge fan of the book, which is my all-time favorite children's book, I was extremely disappointed with this film. If you haven't read the book, you will probably enjoy this rendition very much, but if you love the story, you will feel ripped off. It is a terrific story that does not need the massive amount of tweaking that it endured in this film. In fact, the original tale is all but unrecognizable here. What a shame."
1,Poor Quality,"The DVD was rattling around in the case, so I opened it to see if it was OK. There were a few scratches, but I popped it into the DVD player anyway. The quality was very poor. Black dots and lines throughout the movie. I will be returning this."
1,What was the point,"Why bother making a film of a Little Princess without actually reading it. The book was set in the 19th century and the father never came back, he was dead. Also why the move to America?"
4,PERFECT FOR THE OLD AND THE YOUNG,"This was a great movie to watch with my little sister. It was the type of fairytale story we could both enjoy. Liesel Matthews is such a talented actress. She was perfect in this role. I think every child, and every adult can relate to something in this movie. Whether it be the fact that a war has forced a man to leave his child at a boarding school, or a young girl having to adjust to new friends,a bully, and a mean-spirited head-mistress of the school. Through all this young girl endures, she keeps a positive attitude and survives. Very uplifting for the young."
2,"If you loved the book, this is *NOT* the movie for you!","I was very excited when I heard they were doing another remake of ""A Little Princess"" as it was a favorite book of mine. But why, oh why? must Hollywood think that they can improve on a classic by drastically changing the plot? Ugh. If you loved the book, look for the 1990 version instead starring Nigel Havers and Amelia Shankley. You'll be *much* happier with it."
2,Missing the Charm and Literary Quality of the Book,"This movie was a big disappointment--it comes across flat as a pancake. I was dismayed to see the change in the ending, but that wasn't the only thing which was changed. The whole feeling of the movie was different than the book. I wasn't even compelled to feel sorry for Sarah, because she comes across as spoiled and superior in the movie. Her charm and imagination never shine through. All in all, this picture was just a shadow of the wonderful story Francis Hodgson Burnett wrote."
2,there are better versions,"When my girls were young, we read the book several times. This is very disappointing in its departure from Francis Hodgson Burnett's story. (The Shirly Temple version did its own thing.) Wonderworks has a wonderful production which is true to the book."
1,"There's a better version, true to the book","While this version of A Little Princess is not necessarily bad, the producers took so many liberties with Frances Hodgson Burnett's novel that people who've read the book may be unable to watch it. The boarding school is in London, not New York, for example, and the addition of songs and fuzzily filmed dancing detracts. If you want the accurate and entertaining version, go for the WonderWorks A Little Princess with Amelia Shankley, Maureen Lipman, Miriam Margolys, and Nigel Havers. I hope you need not be warned away from the Shirley Temple version."
5,Wonderful!,"No words can describe it. All I can say is that this film is inferior in the genre only to ""The Secret Garden."" A great film for a father and daughter to watch... perhaps on Father's Day?"
4,Capable adaptation,The Bottom Line:Though A Little Princess sometimes veers too much towards stupid-kid-cinema (e.g. awful reaction shots of little girls snickering while some evil adult gets his/her comeuppance) it's a pretty good adaptation of the classic children's story that (mainly) resists amping up the drama and is directed with a deft hand by Cuaron; it's not great but it's a family movie that won't make adults reach for the nearest handgun.3/4
4,Good movie,"I think this movie is a great family movie. It has everything you want in it. Friendship, drama, imagination and a happy ending."
4,Kids like it,I had to buy this movie because my ten year old daughter wants to rent it every time we go to the video store.
4,Ridiculous but funny,"I couldn't believe they changed the plot when I finished the movie! But since it's quite entertaining, I am ok with it. There're many funny scenes in this movie, I have to say it's like a comedy how they made it. Personally, I like the original better."
4,A Little Princess,"I've never read the book, but I really enjoyed the movie. I've loved this movie since the first time I saw it when I was a little girl. Now that I have my own little girl, I want to show her this movie when she gets a little older. I think it's a good movie to show to your children."
5,One of my all time favorites.,"I have read the book and have seen and own all three movie versions (Shirley Temple, BBC and this one) althouh the BBC on has the correct story, this is my favorite. I don't care that they changed the story in fact I liked it better this way. I have probably seen this movie at least 15 times. It is one of my all time favorite movies. My favorite part is when the indian guy does that mind thing with Sara's father and then her father runs outside and screams on the top of his lungs ""Sara"". That part is so good. I could go on and on about all my other favorite parts but that would take too long and I would end up talking about every scene in the movie. BUY IT!"
1,Not true to book,"Doesn't it bother anyone that they changed the book so much??? New York instead of London, Sarah not looking at all like she's supposed to, and a different ending? If you REALLY want to appreciate A Little Princess, why doesn't someone make a DVD version of the BBC Production with Amelia Shankey, who is a much truer Sarah in a much more faithful version. We managed to find it on VHS but not DVD. The book has been loved for three generations -- why mess with it??"
4,Poor Little Rich Girl,"The young star of ""A Little Princess,"" Liesel Matthews, aka Liesel Pritzker, is a real life poor little rich girl. She and her wealthy Chicago family have recently made headlines regarding disputes over the management of their fortune. Life imitating art?"
4,Nice Film,"This is a lovely film, with some very nice cinematography and a captivating storyline. It manages to catch some of the innocence of childhood. It's major flaw, however, is that it strays significantly from the original text, and is set in an altogether different time period, with many of the sub-plots being quite altered. There are also a few moments of over-dramatic, Hollywood-type scenes with detract from the film (and are not present in the book). I would therefore not consider this to be a very good adaptation--it is simply TOO different. Still, as a film in and of itself it is quite nice, certainly worth seeing, and particularly nice for children. If you are interested in a truer version, see the BBC version produced in the late 1980s and starring Amelia Shankley."
5,Wonderful movie to share with your daughter.,"We saw this movie on HBO and purchased it because it is so beautiful. My daughter is 6 and the message that EVERY little girl is a princess, no matter what your clothing or jewelry is like, or from where you grew up. The movie, in a few parts, is a bit too 'unrealistic.' But then again, that is why it is a movie! The bottom line is that my daughter and I watch it often and always cry at the ending.... The love of a daughter and a parent truly transcends all."
5,A great movie,"This movie reminded me of how everyone is special in the world, and how the world isn't fantasy, it's reality. When someone takes away you privlidges for no reason and says you're not special, you know that person is wrong. Everyone is extraordinary in their own way, even if someone else doesn't like it."
4,Remakes don't have to be copies....,"I had never seen the original (Shirley Temple) movie when I watched this for the first time and I think I would have thought less of it if I had. I really was able to appreciate the fresh take on this story and the gorgeous visuals. The sequences where you see Hindu parables are exceptionally well done. The art direction in this movie was spot on, down to the correct colors for the victorian era girls clothes. I also thought the casting was great and that the performers were adroit at bringing their characters to life."
4,good,"A good hearted movie about love, loss, and the challenges that we may encounter along the way. A very worthwhile watch."
5,A Review On... A Little Princess,"I think it is a great book and DVD. I think it has a great ending, I would write more but I don't want to give away the plot for those who haven't read or seen it yet, but I do have one more thing to say, you should!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,The best family film ever.,"In my opinion, the 1995 film ""A Little Princess"" is the best family film ever made, along with the 1993 ""Secret Garden"". This is also better than the 1939 Shirley Temple film version. The cinematography and musical score are on par with ""Secret Garden"". Liesel Matthews gives one of the absolute best child performances in film history as Sara Crewe. She looks very striking and attractive, and her voice is so soothing and natural. My favorite scene is the snow dance in the middle of the film. It reminds me of Winona Ryder in the ice dance scene in ""Edward Scissorhands"". The plot of the film kind of closely resembles ""An American Tail"", but it's somehow much better. If you parents out there are looking for a film for your kids, rent this one."
3,"OK, but...","I like the movie well enough for what it is, but it's not as good as 1993's ""The Secret Garden."" The girl who played Sarah Crewe did a wonderful job. She gave her character a lot of spunk and energy."
2,"""Garden"" > ""Princess""","""A Little Princess"" is a second-rate melodrama for children. It gives us a glimpse of trench warfare in World War I, complete with poison gas. A small but important part of the action takes place in images from East Indian imagination.The movie apparently teaches that make-believe can transform your world and make it wonderful, though the teaching is undercut by the slapstick ending of a comic romance and elopement.Fantasy stories can help us see clearly and prepare us for real life, but I don't think this one does so. After one viewing, the effect was not unlike a large helping of strawberry ice cream in a bowl of beef stew. ""Princess"" has its good points, so let's give it 3/10 (vs. 6 or 7/10 for ""The Secret Garden"", which has a better story and fine photography). If you buy ""Princess,"" consider getting the dvd with ""The Secret Garden"" on the other side."
3,Sweet Princess,"This loses it's charm if I watch it too much,but it is a nice movie about a rich girl sent to an orphanage while her father is away at war.When news comes that her father has been killed,Sara is treated as a maid by the heartless woman who runs the place."
4,female empowerment,"I've been reading over these reviews and was surprised nobody has noted the film's overt theme of female empowerment buried within Sara's message of ""all girls are princesses."" The plot of the movie is not new -- riches to rags to riches again. Director Alfonso Cuarón and writers Richard LaGravenese and Elizabeth Chandler, however, infuse this traditional story with an overlay of female bonding that pushes Frances Burnett's message further than it could have gone in her day.This Little Princess for our time is as plucky as Buffy the Vampire Slayer without losing Shirley Temple's innocence. Burnett had the right idea but was restrained to the values of her day. Act like a princess and you will be one. Cuarón must have had a strong mother or sister because his heroine shows her ""princessness"" with strength, honor and courage.And all little girls are born possessing just that."
5,magic at its best,"I remember I was around 10 when I watched this with my family. We picked it out by chance, but honestly, it made every cell of my body weep. I was still learning English and my classmates were sometimes harsh on me. A movie can be so magical that you can dwell into the atmosphere of the characters and the scenario. This movie built my confidence, expanded my imagination as a child, and influenced me to believe in my dreams. This is the kind of movie that I will never forget, I gasped when i saw it here on amazon. I do not believe it is jus t a kids movie. Now that it's here, i'm buying it and everyone's gonna see it, even my 20 year friends in college."
5,Very cute movie!!,"A sweet movie, well made, well acted out. One of my all time favourite, a great child and adult film.There are some lessons whitin the story, it's emotionally stirring, highly recommended.Watched it several times without getting bored."
1,unfortunately disgusting,"An unfortunate and disgusting play on ""research"" -- inauthentic sources and second-hand guesses at best. Definitely a biased Orientalist book with biased and prejudiced information. Books and information by author Karen Armstrong are much less biased and more honestly developed."
5,Phenomenal review source!,"This series is a great review source for Step 1. This volume was my favorite, since I am an anatomy buff. The figures and x-rays are outstanding and similar to what you will encounter on your exam. The explanations are superb. I liked the way the answers were on the back of the page so that you were able to guess the answer(s) first. Definitely recommend this whole series for anyone who is serious about trying to do well on the exam (I got a 238 - about 20 points higher than I was shooting for!)."
5,Amazing!,"My son loves this video, and I think I might like it even more than he does. The acrobatics are astonishing, and my son loves the clown antics. The best part is a bell routine done by one of the clowns. It is showmanship at its finest."
5,Catchy music and a great variety of circus action,"My 2-year-old LOVES this tape -- and for all the times I have sat with her to watch it, it doesn't get old. It's just good entertainment!"
1,Not much Mickey,"This is essentially a poor quality video of a circus. Every once in awhile there is a shot of Minnie Mouse in the crowd or Goofy slapping his knee. My children, who love Mickey Mouse and love the circus were very bored by this video, as was I."
2,"Even for a fan, this is marginal - buy it for curiosity","Bruce fans beware: this is not another ""Tracks"", with album-quality songs that weren't released for a variety of valid creative reasons. These songs are raw -- largely just Bruce and an acoustic guitar -- unfocused, and hyperpoetic in that very early ""Bruce is the new Dylan"" way.Bruce was just starting to learn the real art of songwriting when these recordings were made; hence, what is here as ""Eloise"" later received all new lyrics and became the classic ""Growin' Up.""If your all-time favorite Bruce song is ""Mary, Queen of Arkansas"" you might listen to this repeatedly. Otherwise, if you don't mind the price, get it for the curiosity value only."
3,A Bruce Letdown,"I know it's sacreligious to bad mouth a Springsteen album, but I was very disappointed with this one. Sure, Bruce didn't authorize this release, but anyone charging this much for a CD should feel ashamed to put out such a poor quality product. I would have enjoyed it much more if it were not so scratchy sounding. With the technology available today, I expected a little better sound. Unfortuanately, every Boss fan will buy this. I did. This is definitely one I should have passed on."
4,I finally found the song,If I were the priest has the most amazing lyrics. The old bootlegs aren't as good. The sound quality is much better. This is for a true bruce fan. Don't bother if you're favorites are pop sounding stuff fromthe 80's.
2,BEFORE THE E STREET BAND IS A BETTER TITLE,"If you are looking for Bruce with his acoustic guitar and no band, this CD is for you. It will remind you of ""Tom Goad"", which I actually own but have not seen since the first and only time I played it.Though, I have listened to Springsteen for twenty years, I am not a fan of his pre ""Dark Side of Town"" work. I never cared for Dylan and I do not like any of Springsteen's solo work.If you like BUSA, etc, you will not like this CD. Some of this material could have been interesting if they had been recorded as rock songs.I gave the CD Two stars because it was made by Springsteen."
1,Low Quality & Type I only,"This usb compact flash adapter only works with Type I compact flash cards - something that is sort of strange, considering the enormous slot into which you are expected to insert your compact flash Type I cards.In fact, the slot is so large that it is difficult to insert cards accurately. Rather, you find yourself jiggling it around while trying to insert it, hoping you don't damage the card or the usb adapter.Do yourself a favor and buy a higher quality product."
2,Nice pictures but little information,We purchased an Eyewitness travel guide when we went to London and it was terrific. Unfortunatly the Germany book did not live up to the previous book. While there are many nice pictures there is virtually no information on how to get to the sites. Part of the problem is the book tries to cover too much. Germany is a large and varried country and as such is hard to cover in a such a small book.
5,DEATH ROW MADAM,"I've interviewed Cheri Woods, and from what I understand it's true to what she lived through. She's come out stronger."
1,A Joke,"I ordered this book used for $5.00. Being familiar with some of the people and incidents, I thought it may be a good book. The first 100 pages were well written, but after that it's like a first grader took over the writing. Mis-spelled words, sentences fragmented, etc. Throughout her writing, Ms. Woods decided to add every National Inquirerer article from the time period into her book, even though THEY HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH HER! So if there was an L.A. rumor going around, she implied she had some kind of knowledge or involvement about it. But if you read her writing, they had nothing to do with her. I could not finish the book and was not upset when my puppy (literally) finished it for me. I just wish I could get my $5.00 back!I noticed that the book was written in 2001, had it's first (one star) review in 2008, and suddenly has 13 five star reviews ALL written in February of 2012...??? Come on, was there a Woods family reunion in February?"
1,"Yawn, another wannabe",Not worth your time. Cheri woods only talent is lying. The book is full of fabrication. She was put in prison because she is a criminal. Do your research. This is just another lame attempt at notoriety in Hollywood by a wannabe. Yawn! Very sad.
5,Dora's Talking Kitchen,This product came from Amazon so fast I thoght maybe the wharehouse was down the street. I ordered it 5 days before my daughters birthday thinking that I would have some explaining to do if it didn't arrive by the special day. To my surprise it came 2 days before her birthday and I had to try to hide this enormous box from her. My daughter loves it! It's so fun to watch her cook like mommy!
4,Fab kitchen for anyone who adores Dora,My daughter is 2 1/2 and she loves this kitchen. She eats and sleeps this kitchen. She talkes on the phone to Diego and Boots and Abuelita and she uses the blender. Her little brother plays with her and turns the knobs and opens the doors. They do rough-house though and the kitchen gets a little tippy. That would be my only problem with it. It was easy to put together even with 2 kids trying to play before it was done.
5,Completely and Totally Satisfied,"My 4 year old found a way to mention a Dora Kitchen every day from the middle of November until Christmas and as Christmas got closer the more it turned into BEGGING! I really think that she would have passed out if she had not seen one on Christmas morning. She has played with it and cooked me and her brother something every single day since Christmas. I think it was a little expensive compared to some of the other kitchens but it is exactly what she wanted, all that she wanted and her happiness makes it worth it."
4,Love it!,"We bought this kitchen for our daughter's 3rd birthday. I think it is one of the best toys that she has ever received. She has a lot of fun pretending to cook and make meals.The one thing I did notice about this kitchen compared to other kitchens is that it doesn't really make any ""cooking"" noises but it does have a grinder that makes a noise, a phone and the recipe cards which take you on a ""cooking adventure"".The other thing I had to look out for was Amazon's price - as we bought this gift just before xmas, the price was changing constantly - I saw two prices within an hour.All in all this kitchen was good value for money and can keep my daughter occupied for hours"
3,not worth $65 but okay,"My daughter, whos 4 got this from her grandma for Christmas. It came missing long screws, but we were still able to put it together. For plastic snap on pieces its actually good quality. We got ours at Kmart. I think its over priced at $65, but if your little one likes Dora, it'll be a hit. The burners do not make a sound, which suprises me, most kitchens do and the phone will ring and it will be other Dora characters, but not Dora. All in all I would only buy it for a Dora fan. The music is not that annoying. And it is durable. My very active two year old son plays with it."
3,Dissapointed in quality,"I was really excited to get this toy for my daughter, but was disappointed at the size and setup. It was way to flimsy, there was no real storage for the playfood. It was open in the back and the talking recipes made no real difference. My daughter didn't find the kitchen too entertaining and played better with an old little tikes kitchen."
2,cheap and not very practical,"this kitchen looks pretty cheap. There is not a lot of space for cooking really and inside the ""fridge"" and oven there are racks so it is hard to place things because things fall through the holes of the racks. I solved that by giving my daughter containers where she could put the food and I tought her that thats were she had to put it to keep it neat and organized. Also the back of the kitchen has holes so things easily fall. the oven is not too spacious, its hard to fit things in because of the rack. I think for this price or a little bit more you can get a nicer looking kitchen with more space in the fridge and oven to store things and to pretend. There are very nice and realistic kitchens out there, get one of those and if your child really loves Dora, just get Dora cups and plates or other accesories for the kitchen. Good Luck!"
3,For Two year Olds Only,"The Dora kitchen has been a great toy for our two year old, however, I can see that she will quickly outgrow this toy as it is limited in it's phrases and she is only mildly entertained by talking to Boots on the phone."
5,Very nice toy,"My daughter was so excited to see the UPS guy show up today with her new kitchen. It was easy to assemble, and the parts seem durable. I agree with everyone else that the kitchen doesn't say much, but my daughter seems to think it's the greatest toy ever made. I'd recommend this to any child obsessed with Dora."
5,Excellent product!!!,"I bought the Dora Talking Kitchen for my 2 year old niece and she loves it! She is very inquisitive and enjoys helping in the kitchen. On Christmas morning, when she opened it, if you could only see the look on her face. She was so excited! She immediately began to play with it. Her favorite things on the Dora Talking Kitchen is the blender and the phone. I recommend this product to anyone who has a child who loves to use their imagination. This product will keep them busy for hours on end."
2,Its OKAY.....not many features....for the same price buy a different one,"I got this for my 2 yo Daughter who LOVES dora. for the price of $79 it isnt worth it.only the map, blender and radio make sounds. nothing else does.some other sets have hundreds of noises but not this one.if you are buying it for pretend play or just because it is DORA (which was our case b/c daughter went nuts when we saw it and cried for it) then you will be happy. But if you want one that makes noises or is interactive etc then dont buy this one.i knew better than to buy this thing. ugg. now it is put together and just dont feel like lugging it to the store for a refund."
2,not as durable,"I bought this item because it was Dora. I was disappointed with quality of the plastic, compared to the Little Tikes kitchen. Otherwise, great idea if they improved the durability."
3,Not that impressed.,"If it were not for the fact that my daughter loves Dora the Explorer, I would never have bought this item. It, to me, is very cheaply made. There were other kitchens at Toys R Us that they had displayed that were much more durable and larger. The plastic on this is very flimsy. The back of the kitchen is open and the toys can fall through the back.The assembly was fairly simple and my kids seemed to really like it, but I feel that if I had bought a different talking kitchen, they would have liked it just as much."
2,Very Disappointed!,"I just got this for my 2 1/2 year old. I was very disappointed. After getting it home from Toys-R-Us I had to go back and ask for another one because the 28 pieces were missing! After getting my new kitchen home and putting it together I am even more disappointed. The radio makes blender noises and the Blender makes the radio noises! I don't think I am even going to bother getting a 3rd one. This kitchen has been sold out everywhere I have looked for it Targets, Walmarts, etc. so I thought it must have been a great toy. My daughter loves anything and everything Dora as most girls do....but take it from me this it NOT WORTH buying. It's a disappointment because I have been happy with all the other Dora toys."
2,Not Worth the Money....,"We ordered this for our 4 year old for Christmas. When she first saw it set up in front of the tree she was thrilled. Upon trying to play with it, she was bored within moments. The quality is mediocre at best, the door falls open, no back on the set at all so the accessories fall out the back. The recipe cards are not entertaining, and it is limited in what this does. For the $65 we paid for this (amazing how it is cheaper after Christmas), is totally not worth it. I wish I had not thrown away the box, because I would have for sure returned it. My daughter plays with it only if passing it and it catches her eye. The cooking pieces are more entertaining than the whole kitchen. Would not recommend this to anyone over the age of 2. Very disappointed in this piece."
1,In what universe?,In what galaxy is this toy worth $400? This toy originally sold for somewhere between $60 and $80. It has been discontinued only because newer models of Dora's kitchen are available.
3,Good,"This is an awesome story, although I cannot relate at all. It lacks good description of the actual North, probably due to simple lack of exposure to it."
1,Fiction poorly written.,"I can understand why this is in the fiction category. It is not very believable and not verifiable. To me it reads as an amalgamation of others' impressions of North Korea lumped into what is supposed to be an actual diary written with poor narrative skills and with original misspellings and and trite, banal observations. After reading several other books on North Korea, I found this one disappointing. I am glad I paid little for it."
5,A perfect fusion between historicy and fiction,I loved this book for many reasons. The most important of all being its similarity to Dan Brown's style of writing. I love historical fiction and this book kept me turning page after page. There needs to be more books such as these to educate people without boring them to death. This book is a true thriller and a great lesson on North Korea.
3,Good Liesure read,"Excellent story. The only thing is that you can't verify the authenticity of the source. Regardless, it'll give you one heck of a wild story and a good reminder of why America is so great."
5,Shocking account of North Korea!,"If you are going to read one book about North Korea, this is the one! What I really liked about this book is that it's more than just another boring nonfiction book about North Korea. This book is a real page turner and kept me up at night."
5,fat and sassy,"Some pens are fat, some are thin, and most people have a preference.If you like a fat pen, this handsome black-and-chrome item is a good candidate.It's satisfyingly heavy and reasonably well balanced. I think Cross does a great job with satin black finishes and the generous chrome appointments give this pen a bold appearance without becoming gauche.Writing quality is good, though you can find better at a higher price.Consider this pen the Audi A6 of writing instruments, an entry-level luxury that may not compete with the Mercedes but is certainly fun to drive."
4,"Dissapointed at first, now thoroughly satisfied","Although this pen does not have the regal look of other more costly pens it does have a nice feel. Out of the box this pen started skipping, nothing I tried could get it to work properly.I figured it must be a faulty ink refill so I ordered a new fefill and presto now it works great, very smooth. The pen is now with me always which is what I had intended for it in the first place."
4,Purchase of a pen from AMAZON,"It is not only beautiful but awriting piece I enjoy to use. i hve to write a lot, I am glad that I chose this pen. I spent about 3 or 4 days hunting for a pen of my choice ten atlast I found thia pen. I wanted a pen that looked good n light weight and use it enjoy its flow that is what I found in this pen."
2,Okay Monogram programmer,"The Midnight Limited, an overnight train from New York City (?) to Montreal is plagued by a robber and killer who disappears in the night after commiting his crimes. Ace railroad detective John King (Ace Drummond in the serial of that name) investigates and has time to romance passenger/robbery victim Marjorie Reynolds and sing half a song along the way. It's an okay Monogram programmer, nothing special but it doesn't put you to sleep either with its short running time of 61 minutes. Not much of interest to train fans, just a few stock shots of a moving train and a couple of train terminal (depot) scenes, probably shot on the studio back lot. It's a typical Alpha transfer...looks like it originated on VHS tape, maybe even at the 4 hour speed. Not as bad as some Alpha titles though."
5,Favorite marble run expansion set!,"Purchased the ringing track to expand our growing marble run set. This particular expansion set is the favorite for my 4 yr old daughter. She LOVES the gentle pinging sound the marble on the way down the ramp. It was easy for her to include as part of her building routine. The drop hole block also proved itself useful in a variety of ways with our other blocks. As with all of the HABA wood marble run sets we purchased, it is supremely high quality. Good craftsmenship. Highly recommend."
4,Little ships in a big war,"Having read many books on the naval war in the Pacific during World War II, the role of the PT boats was something I rarely came across. This book gives a great overview of PT boat operations in the Philippines during the dark, early days of the war, as well as later on in the Solomons and New Guinea campaigns. Lots of great stories about interesting actions, raids and rescue missions, and I especially liked the description of the role PT boats played in the Battle of Surigao Strait. A nice, quick read, well worth the time!"
2,DISAPPOINTED,"I OWN A COPY THE BOOK OFFERED FOR SALE IN THE CATALOG. I WANTED TWO MORE COPIES OF THE ONE PICTURED. WHAT I GOT WAS A SMALL PRINT PAPERBACK, WITH A DIFFERENT COVER ALL TOGETHER BY "" JOVE WAR BOOK"" NOT BY ""BALLANTINE BOOKS"" AS PICTURED IN THE AD. THIS ORDER WAS MADE WITH ""YANKEECOZY"". I WILL KEEP THIS BOOK AND GIVE MY GOOD ONE TO A FRIEND TO HAVE. THE OTHER ORDER I MADE WAS WITH A DIFFERENT DISTRIBUTOR. HOPEFULLY I WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED AGAIN.IN THIS BOOK THE THE MAPS AND PICTURES ARE HALF THE SIZE OF THE ADVERTISED BOOK.IF THIS IS THE WAY ""YANKEECOZY"" DOES BUSINESS I CAN'T RECOMMEND THEM FOR THEIR UNSATISFACTORY SWITCH OF PRODUCTS."
2,Fats Domino The Collections,I was disappointed in the quality of the CD and returned it. I was not disappointed in how Amazon handle it. They gave full credit without any hassels. HDA
5,Happy to find this treasure...,I have this as a cassette. I have searched on other sites and finally found it on Amazon. Beautiful love songs and an awesome singer. Don't grow tired of listening to it. Thanks.
4,A great travel companion,"Katherine Kizilos, through her book, was one of my most treasured travel companions during my recent month-long trip to Greece. Though I kept thinking to myself, ""this is not great literature,"" I enjoyed and benefitted from her writing immensely. In one part of the book she is a fairly typical tourist, in spite of her Greek roots and ability to speak Greek. It was comforting to read her mistakes and frustrations. But the larger theme of the work, both in the section where she is a tourist and where she returns to her father's village, is the contrast between the traditional Greek ways and the encroachment of the modern. Along the way are numerous insights into Greek history (and its effect on people today), the landscape, and the relation of Greeks and Turks.I very much enjoyed Katherine Kizilos's warm and sensitive book and was very tempted to drive a few hours out of my way to her father's village on the off chance that she might be there!"
2,Good for unfair competition--not so for intellectual property,"I purchased this one after a brief flip-through, thinking it presented a good overview of intellectual property law woven through a framework of unfair competition law.That's not the right way to describe this book. It's really a nutshell about unfair competition law (the foreword reveals that the book used to be called ""Unfair Trade Practices in a Nutshell""). Intellectual property law is discussed, but only inasmuch as it relates to unfair competition law. Lots of IP is left out--the section about patents, for instance, says very little about best mode, statutory bar, and other basic concepts, other than defining them in a sentence or two.While this is still a useful guide for business lawyers and law students, the title is very misleading. If you want a decent guide to IP, get the other nutshell on intellectual property."
1,NOT DURABLE,"I always thought the Dewalt name meant quality - was this hose ever a disappointment! After less than 10 hours of use on a deck and patio, over 25% of the rubber covering the braided steel peeled away. This resulted in the braid rusting wherever exposed."
5,"Revolutionizing The Home Recording Industry, One Studio At A Time!","Just when I thought I knew it all about voice-overs, my agent and producers started asking me to audition at home. Honestly, I was overwhelmed by the thought of it all. And thought that maybe this was the technological chasm, the great divide, that would separate the wheat from the chaff....and not related to voice-over abilibity.And then I found Harlan Hogan's and Jeffrey P. Fisher's book on Home Recording. To say it has saved my derriere is putting it mildly. Harlan and Jeffrey take you through step-by-step on what affordable equipment to buy, how to set up your home studio and how to properly record and edit yourself. They even toss in chapters on ISDN and phone patch, as well as self-promoting your home studio.A ""home run"" if you ask me...and you did!"
5,Very helpful,"These guys know what they're talking about. When setting up my home studio I followed this book to a T. It's technical boring stuff, but they are both really funny so it makes it an easier read. I keep it in my studio and refer back to it when troubleshooting. They may have a newer version of it now since a lot has changed since this was written. There is new software, like Source Connect, that I'm sure thay address."
4,Great Book,This book is great for people who are new to voice overs. It's a must buy if you want to set up your own studio.
2,old and rotting dont buy it,"the tongue on the back was pealing off and rotting the hand does not go around your neck it goes on your shoulder doesn't stay in place if you move it falls off it looked old and used!!!!!"""
4,My Book Review,"I read this book to learn more about my Korean culture. I thought the book wasn't so bad even though it wasn't as informative about Korea as I thought it would be. The story is about a girl named Alice, who is a Korean adoptee and is a student at Bainer Jr. High School. Her life was going well until a new boy came to her school from Korea, named Yoon Jun Lee. Now Alice has to face a new life. I would recommend this book to all people who are Korean that want to know more about their culture. The characters were very enthusiastic and weird. For example, a character named Yoon Jun had a very weird, but funny accent. I would give the author (Marie G. Lee) a thumbs up because she gave a little info a lot of excitement! I liked the book because it was interesting and fun to read."
5,What I liked about this book,"I read this book for my church's Korean Culture class. I liked the book because it's about making new friends. This book is about a girl named Alice and a boy named Yoon Jun, who are both Korean, but the girl has trouble making friends with the boy.I liked the characters, Alice and Yoon Jun, for example, Alice was once mad at Yoon Jun but later said sorry and they made up. I give thumbs up to this book.The book impressed me because some of the friends stand up for one another. I think my teacher would like this book because she loves to learn the cultures of other people.This book review was done by Praise Kang, age 8."
1,My review,"I read this book for a Korean-American Literature class. This class is part of the Korean school program that I attend in Holmdel, NJ. The story is about 2 Koreans who go on strange adventures until they become friends. I thought the book was okay. It was interesting to read Alice's mental diary. But because I am a boy I had trouble relating. It took a long time for Alice to get through her issues with Yoon Jun. It made the plot drag on and I didn't think the story related to me and to other Koreans and their experiences."
4,<:-P,"Alice is a very Americanized Asian and she is very comfotable with her lifestyle until... there is a Korean boy named Yoon Jun Lee and he is very Asianized and he is not used to the Amercan culture until...there is a international day festival and he and Alice become friends and they both learn future lessons about their lifes, i loved this book i didn't think i would be very happy with this book seeing as how it kind of reminded me of a childerns book but it was very intresting what i did not like was that the author i think skipped through things to fast and i didn't understand how they went to being worst enemys to being good friends but i guess thats the way some realtionships work all in all I thought this book was very good and i enjoyed it very much!! <:-P"
4,From cheerleading to Embarisment,This story is about a girl who is very popular and she is on the cheerleading squad. Then this Korean family moves to town and Alice is forced to meet them even when she does not want to. Alice then finds out that the geek from the Korean family is going to her school and is making Alice feel uncomfortable. Alice then starts to see all these writings on the lunchroom and she is blaming Yoon Jun Lee. After lunch she sees Travis Jones picking on Yoon Jun and she does not want to help him but she feels bad.I kind of liked this book because it had a lot of action but not enough. I also liked it because it had short chapters and kept you guessing. I would say this book is not my favorite and that other books have been better.
1,NOT Japanese Cuisine,"I was very excited to receive this book as a gift, being I recently made friends with two Japanese families near where I live.Unfortunately, not having heard of Colette Rossant, I did not realize that this is HER version of Japanese food, not a book of Japanese recipes.I was hoping that she would explain Japanese food to American readers so we could understand their food easier.Instead, I found a book utilizing Japanese ingredients in a French manner.Maybe this will be of interest to some of you, but I found the title of the book to be misleading, as I was looking for a Japanese cookbook."
4,great tracks,curiosity killed the the cat have always been an under-rated group. their first album still sounds great after all these years. it was a joy to find this rare 2nd album on amazon. generally good tracks esp. the minor hits (i need your lovin' and hang on in there). other tracks are real growers. it was a nice surprise to see misty oldland make an appearance on two of the songs (what's happened to her?). the only dud is the cover of 'killing me softly'.
3,Incomplete and flawed,"Sugden gives a good account of the murders, but he is far too impressed with his own theories and interpretations. Any theory he does not agree with is summarily dismissed without explanation."
2,maggiemu,I found this book to be a bit boring and quite wordy for my personal taste. There were alot of facts that seemed to lead nowhere. I wasn't impressed!
5,The First Book for Those Interested in Jack,"Philip Sudgen's The Complete History of Jack the Ripper strips the killer and his victims away from the many, many myths and legends that have attached themselves to him over the past century and sticks to just the facts. This is the best available book on Jack the Ripper and the best place to begin this gruesome journey before picking up the more fanciful tales and outrageous consipiracy theories (quite fun in their own weird way but, of course, are more about the authors than Jack the Ripper or his victims). This is a long book that is as a complete as it title trumpets and is an essential component of any library looking at crime. This tale will continue to tantalize and horrify and Philip Sugden's book makes the truth even more interesting and frightening than any of the legends. And that is an amazing feat."
4,Loved it!,I love Jack the Ripper history and this book was really great. We went on a Jack the Ripper tour in London and I read it after I got home and it really put everything together that I had learned on the tour.
4,very interesting,"It is a very interesting read. There are a lot of different or ""new"" and different facts that aren't covered in the movies we see."
4,The best Ripper book,"This is the place to start if you're curious about Jack the Ripper. Sugden uses original documents to cut through a century of Ripper mythology repeated at 3rd,4th and 5th hand by earlier Ripper books. He also has no axe to grind in behalf of any particular candidate for the mantle of original Ripper."
5,Very detailed account,"I was highly impressed with the detail in the book. This was the best account I have read on the subject, and I appreciate the fact that the author did his own research of newspaper articles and police files, and did not rely on previous works that have distorted the facts."
4,"Objective and well researched, but not a page turner","This is probably the definitive Jack the Ripper book. It is everything that most books are not. It doesn't put forth wild theories about charity workers or dim-witted royals. Sugden does not spend half the book discussing the letter forgeries. It is amazingly researched and I think almost totally objective. He does state clearly who of his main suspects (he doesn't name many: most theories are completely ludicrous) he thinks should definitely not be suspects. Noticibly missing: Walter Sickert. This may be because the book was written before the publishing of the infamous book accusing him, or because he doesn't deem him a worth suspect. Also could have used more on the living conditions of the East End at that time as some of the other books include. Overall, no ripperologist should be without it."
4,"Kids movie, Adult's soundtrack","Who would have expected the soundtrack for a kids movie to be this good? I originally purchased it for Maroon 5/Bill Withers version of ""Lovely Day"" and Jimmy Buffett's Floridays, but have really enjoyed the different types of music that music supervisor Savannah Jane Buffett has put together. Parrott Heads have plenty to enjoy on this disc too, with ""Wondering Where The Lions Are"", ""Good Guys Win"", ""Barefootin'"" (with Alan Jackson) and Jimmy's cover of the Warren Zevon classic ""Werewolves Of London"". There is plenty for the non-Parrot Heads to love as well. The cuts by G.Love and Toots & The Maytals are fun summertime music that just get stuck in your head. Even the score, ""Happy Ending"", is bright and sunny. This CD hasn't left my car since it arrived."
3,Bought for the Buffett,"As a die-hard Parrothead I bought the Hoot soundtrack just for the Buffett tracks on it. An interesting mix, great to hear him belting out Werewolves of London and the remake of Floridays is worth the CD itself. Other tracks from Jimmy (Good Guys Win, Barefootin' w/Alan Jackson) are OK, but maybe not worth just purchasing the CD for. Other non-Buffett tracks are an interesting mix of various styles, although if you are a Maroon 5 fan their track will lack some for you. Bottom line--if you love Buffett, make the investment, especially for Floridays. If you are a on-again/off-again fan, it may not be worth your $$$."
4,An enjoyable listen--3 1/2 stars.,"The songs aren't bad...The best part by FAR is hearing the soulful sounds of Fingers Taylor back on Harmonica behind Buffett. Buffet's vocals on ""Wherewolves of London"" are lacking, but, wow, that Harpoon Man sounds good.I'm no Parrot Head. I've been a Buffet fan too long to go for that stuff. I'd have gone higher, but some of the tracks--""Good Guys Win"" for example--sound a bit bland for my tastes."
4,"Fun soundtrack, definitely an upper","Really enjoyed ""Hoot"" and the soundtrack keeps up with the high-spirited fun. Plus, I think all the music from the film was there. We've got some classic Buffett ""Floridays"" and a wonderful cover of Warren Zevon's ""Werewolves of London."" I especially like the version of ""Lovely Day"" and ""Good Guys Win."""
3,Great New Jimmy Buffet Song!,"I like this version of ""Floridays."" This is the only place to get the new Jimmy Buffet song, ""Good Guys Win."" It is excellent. ""Wondering Where The Lions Are"" is also pretty good."
3,Lightweight Freakshow,"The Maddening is a psychological thriller starring Burt Reynolds and Angie Dickinson. The story starts out with a mom who decides to ""runaway"" with her young daughter after getting into a disagreement with her husband.The classic red convertible looks nice, but of course it has engine problems right around where Roy Scudder's(BURT) gas station is located. So this is the spark that leads to the insanity that Burt, Angie, and family dish out to the poor, helpless mom and her young daughter.The story, of course, lacks depth; but at least you get some ""single-layered"" fun from Burt and Angie's deranged characters. Lightweight, no-depth, quick-frills; don't expect much more from this movie."
3,A violent and interesting film,"The Maddening is an interesting and violent thriller, based on Andrew Neidderman's novel (the same author of ""The Devil's Advocate""), about Cassie (Mia Sara, in a good interpretation, she really passes all the fragility of her character), a woman who runs away with her daughter, and ends up being the victim of a crazed and dangerous man (Burt reynolds, terrific and scary as a psycopath).This film has some really tense moments , like the ending, or the part in which Reynolds' character rapes Cassie, and the basic idea is entertaining and touching, but the film suffers a lot by the poor production (this is clearly a B-movie) and the horrible direction by Danny Huston. Although very predicable, The Maddening turns out to be a good, but forgetable, thriller."
3,"Good Pictures, but Average Material","This is a beautifully illustrated book with clear, full-color photographs of the species discussed. Unfortunately there simply isn't enough information (especially on the technical side) on the subjects covered, and many interesting or fairly popular species are absent from the text. Since they mention quite a few species, why not delve a little deeper? I'd definitely recommend this book to beginners eager to learn more about what species are ""out there"", or for the more experienced hobbyist looking for a basic visual reference. A sequel to this material would be great!"
3,"good, but ordinary, thrash...","At War is good thrash (it was anyway, 20 years ago, unlike their disapointing come back). That sums it all up. I bought this vynil back in the days and it was good to have some beers with it and so on. But it is not an album that will make much history really. To compare them to Venom, Kreator, Sodom, Exodus who were genuinely groundbreaking is abusive and just show how some metal fans can be easily pleased and shows why the genre eventually got boring and predictable. Also, the guys are not just ""un-pc"", they are complete war mongering fascists, singing idiotic lyrics, and takes away all the joy from music in my opinion."
5,good experience,"The book arrived on time as promised and was in excellent shape. I bought the book as a gift, and I had no worries about presenting it as such."
2,Bad shipment?,"I used to order these for my company as I had thought they were of a good quality and had good customer support, that and they were the only 1-1/2"" bits I could find. But after having four of them in a row shear at the drive end after a week of use I was sure that they had either got a bad steel shipment or had cheaper out. Which wouldn't be so bad if milwalkie was at all interested in fixing a potential problem with there manufacturing.Long story short save yourself time and money buy the more expensive wood owls or Lenox bitsI will not be buying one of these again"
5,Milwaukee Auger bit is awesome,This bit is perfect for anyone needing to drill large holes through a few inches of wood repeatedly. Eats through nails like butter and requires little force by the user as the bit pulls itself through the material with ease. Does require a very strong drill though and I use the Milwaukee Super Hawg.
2,Not Sharp!,These things are hopeless! The Chinese don't even bother to sharpen off the paint on the edges. The steel is soft. They are easy to sharpen with a file - as long as you do it frequently. This design has no spurs - just a single dull cutting edge. They will bore a hole but not cleanly.
3,Large Print Life Application Bible.. thin pages,"The text is large enough that I can read it, however, the pages are so thin that the text from the reverse page shows through making it very difficult to read the page you want to. The interpretation helps tremendously and makes the Bible much easier to understand. I've taken it to church with me twice and the binding has already shifted causing the book to close lopsided.I understand that it takes more space & weight to make a large print Bible, but the thin pages could definitely be made of a better product that is not so transparent. Most people that have visual problems like me, will struggle to see the print."
3,disappointed in the kindle version,"MY issue is not with the Bible itself, of which I have a hard copy version, however I was disappointed in the Kindle version as it is not searchable which is the main reason I ordered it. It is also somewhat awkward to navigate and, although I know that a Kindle display is black and white, I thought they would have found a way to fullfill the claim that the words of Christ were in red, maybe by underlining them. After I downloaded it I went back and looked at the description and as far a I can tell the one for the hard copy and the Kindle version are the same."
1,Broken Links on Kindle for Mac,"When I purchased this in August 2011, all links to study notes, etc worked perfectly on my iPad as well as my Apple laptop. After a Kindle for Mac update the end of October, the links on the Mac ceased to work. After a few emails and online chats back and forth between Tyndale and Amazon, no workable solution was found. (A couple of the suggestions were downright comical) I emailed Amazon with my information earlier this month and asked for a refund, which they processed without question. I am sorry that it doesn't work, as this is my favorite Bible to use."
4,"Great Content, small print","I purchased this Bible for my granddaughter. The Life Application notes are excellent, but being a ""personal sized"" edition, I would recommend the regular size for most readers. btw, she loves the Celtic Cross TuTone cover."
5,excellent,"excellent bible illustrates very nicely lovely map photos, the text paper is a bit thin but thats ok if you have some common sense"
5,Life Application Bible Review,An excellent study Bible. Any serious student of the Bible and God's word will benefit from reading this edition. Read just a few verses a day or a lot...either way the reader will be influenced by God's message for today.
5,Personal Word of God,"The Tyndale Life Application personal Study Bible's are great for gifts. There is no other gift better than the Word of God and the people that I give them out to really love them because they are written to easily understand and apply to daily life. They are personal sized so they may be carried any where you are traveling.The Word says, ""Study to show thyself approved unto God; a workman that needeth not to be ashamed rightly dividing the Word of Truth"" 2 Timothy 2:15"
5,Applies to my life today!,This application gives me a better understanding of the Word of God and is easy to read. It helps me understand yesterday today!.
4,Not completely satisfied,"Although the information in this book is wonderful, navigation between books of the Bible is cumbersome. Each time I change books of the Bible, I have to return to the table of contents. Also, copying and pasting is not allowed. If I had been aware of those two factors before ordering the book, I might not have purchased it."
5,A very clear way to study the Bible...,This is a wonderful way to study the Bible as it has explanations below the verses to make it clear for a lay person!!! I have just joined a Bible study at my church and many of the women have this edition and love it.
4,Didn't come with free iLumina Gold starter software,The description says:Free iLumina Gold starter software is included in hardcover and bonded leather bindings.I ordered a new hardcover version from J&J; and it didn't come with any software.
5,Same as the Hard Cover which I have and like.,The reason I chose this eBible is because I own the hard cover version. It's exactly what I wanted.Enjoy
3,Bible,The main problem I have with this bible is the size of the print. It is micro in size and even with great eye sight almost unreadable.
2,Unhappy with reference links,"I bought a Kindle version. The reference links do not work in this copy. Unfortunately at the time of purchase I did not realize that I could return the book. I've looked for the option now and it is no longer available. I read other reviews on this version and see others have had the same problem. I own a hard copy of the study bible and love it, but very disappointed in the kindle version because it is very difficult to navigate with the reference links not working This was my primary reason for purchasing an electronic version, I wanted a light portable version of the same bible."
5,Life Application,"This is my daily bread and I love it, because it is plan reading and would recommend to anyone. It is the Word of God, the lamp to my feet and the light to my daily path!"
5,Nice starter Bible,This product arrived in immaculate condition. It was a gift and a great Bible for a new couple to use together.
1,kindle fire - links in text don't work,When I had a Kindle keyboard this was great. I loved the notes on the chapters and verses. But the links don't work on my Kindle Fire so I cannot read any of the notes or see the maps or references.
3,Reserviing opinion,"I have had limited opportunity to use this Bible, ie, only when traveling. So far, I have been unable to pull up the footnotes which are a very important feature for me, in that I always use them in the printed version I read every day."
5,Life study Bible NLT,love the book. is helping me daily in my walk with God. =-)I would suggest this book to anyone who really wants to learn. it has a break down that explains & helps me a lot. never enjoyed reading until now & now can't wait to be able to.
1,DO NOT LIKE,"Pages are thin you can see text on under page,Text goes into bound margin and will not open up to read into that margin.Text size is not large,just medium"
2,Bible is very useful but leather melted in my car,"This bible is very good looking to the eye and has commentary on the more important verses. My biggest complaint is that last summer, I left the bible in my car and the leather melted to my seat and when I tried to unstick it, it only ruined the bible because the leather stayed stuck to my seat. Now the bible is ugly and the spine came unglued. I was very disappointed. I own a few more bibles that are bigger and bulkier that I don't like carrying to church every Sunday that I leave in my car during the week and none of them have ever had any problems. This is the only bible that's melted in my car, so to me it must be the bible...not the fact that I left it in my car."
5,Wonderful Study Bible,"Bought this for my mom as a Christmas present. She really enjoys it. The detailed information has tremendously helped her with her bible study. Even my dad has been using it, and she commented that he has really enjoyed using it also. He teaches bible study and this has really helped him. Great book for improving your study!"
2,Not as user friendly as I expected,"This Bible is not as user friendly as the Youversion Bible. I have a hard copy of this Bible & I love it, but the electronic version doesn't have all the footnotes like the hard copy of it does."
4,Would recommend this Bible,It has a lot of good references with it also.This translation is easy to understand has a good Concordance.I would recommend this Bible!
1,Links do Not work using Kindle on iPad,"The kindle version was working great, then all the links stopped working making the book useless. I contacted the publisher and they really didn't have a fix for me."
5,great,this book explains things in details such a wonderful study book helps in many ways such a wonderful book must buy
3,I like the bible,"The print was too small, I didn't realize it because on the picture it didn't say. I wish it was a bigger print."
5,Great Bible,Wanted to truly understand the stories of the bible. This study bible makes it possible and relates those stories to todays world.
3,Life Application Bible,I thought I was ordering a 2009 Hardback Bible but what I got was a 2007 indexed Bible. I worked it out with customer service to get the difference in the price of the Bible refunded to me. The Bible is nice but it has very thin pages and you can see through the pages. I liked the indexed pages so that's why I decided to keep the Bible.
4,Love This NLT Life Application Study Bible But...,"I had ordered this version (2009) and received the 2006 indexed version instead. Make sure you check the ISBN number on the Bible and compare it to your order. As others have mentioned, the pages are incredibly thin and you can see the text on the opposite side, making reading a bit difficult. This is with the 2006 edition. Too bad the pages are so transparent."
5,My favorite book.,People always seem surprised when I tell them my favorite book is the Life-Applications Study Bible. I just love everything about this book. It has notes on verses which help you further understand the text. The text is also translaed into plain english so you can actually understand what you're reading. I understand the Bible so much better with this version wheras with the King James Version it gave me a headache. Anyone who is new to the Bible should really consider getting this book. I highly reccomend it.
2,Fix the Kindle Fire hyperlinks!,I was so excited with all the options as outlined in the description but horribly disappointed after purchase to see that the primary intended use of the hyperlinks was not functional on my Kindle Fire. Please repair this!
5,Wonderful Bible,I love this Bible because it has so many great features. The print is very readable and the information contained is awesome - a mini commentary! I was very impressed and told others about it. Buy it - it is great!
3,"Its a good book, wish it was better to navigate through",The paper in the book in quite thin. I wish it was a bit thicker. I also which you could navigate through to find topics better but besides that it is good. I like the descriptions.
5,Finally a study bible that breaks it down to be understood!,"The bible is filled with mystery, murder, love and intrigue. However, with the bibles I've had over the years, I found so difficult to truly understand. This study guide bible breaks down each chapter, verse by verse explaining exactly what is taking place. My husband and I read it aloud each night reading the scripture and then read the breakdown version. This book has allowed us to figure out the stories like never before.We would highly recommend this study bible to anyone!"
3,Doesn't work with IPad app,"Great bible with, kindle and in hardcover, but links don't work when I try to use it with my IPad, I have sent email to amazon but no response. So if you want it just for kindle great, but don't expect to use the study aspect with other devices."
4,Best study Bible,This is the best study Bible I have ever owned. I only went 4 stars because I would have liked more than one highlighting color. Other than that I love all the features
1,Life Application Study Bible,The Bible is wonderful but the problem I had was that the wording was too hard to read. It was too small. I wasn't able to tell when I order it that the wording would be very tiny.
4,A bit cumbersome to use,I find the navigation process cumbersome and not very intuitive. Otherwise this is a super book and I have absolutely no regrets.
2,Life Application Study,Very disappointed. I have the paper bible which I like for the explanations at the bottom but the e-book edition is difficult to maneuver to find the explanations. So frustrating. Disappointed I paid for this. May not use it at all
3,"life application study bible, large print","I like very much the life application bible, but a couple of concerns:The book is quite heavy, so carrying it around and about too cumbersome,or reading in bed too heavy.The book pages are very thin,the print shows though from back page. The large print is not any easier to read because of this.I'm keeping the book because of the study+information."
5,Awesome resource!,"I can't say enough about this Bible. If context is important to you or the ""why"" of how something happened, this is a great learning tool. Perhaps if you're a seasoned bible reader these are not important. However if you're new to reading the bible, it's chock full of the story behind the story so I can understand so much more."
5,Undoubtedly The Best Bible,The Life Application Study Bible is fantastic! Easy to read and understand. The passage explanations at the bottom of each page explain the passages in detail and will help you to understand what was just read. I recommend this Bible to anyone who wants to learn and understand the Words of God. Excellent choice!
1,Unethical.,"I couldn't be more disappointed with this purchase. When you order a product that states it is new you expect it to be new. This book has stains in it. It has writing inside of it. It even has a couple names under the ""death"" page to keep track of family members who have perished. The worst is that when asked about these items I recieved no response from this poor excuse of a company.All I can say is their selling tactics are as unethical as it gets..."
5,Great Bible,"I love this this bible! I don't have the Kindle Edition, I just have the print addition. By far this is the best study Bible I have ever used. The maps, notes, and character profiles are awesome! If you want a Bible that will last, keep you in the Word of God, and help you study, this is the Bible for you!"
3,Applications of Bible itself work?,"We purchased the Life Application Study Bible when we first got our kindle fire because we already have the hard copies and wanted a small to go book! But we can't get to the foot notes and links within the bible to work. Need some help! The Bible it self is great and I love the easy read, just wish the footnotes worked."
4,Great resource Bible,It has been a great help for me in studying the Bible. Though it is easier for me to access on my kindle 1 then on my kindle fire. It has been a great help for me. I have been pleased with my purchase which was around a year ago. I use it to understand the Bible more.
3,No Red Print,My gripe with the Kindle version is that Jesus words are not in red like the demo version. But it does seem to work well with the Kindle. And NLT is an easy to read translation which is important for a study Bible.
5,Life Application Study Bible Review,"This Life Application Study Bible is very reader friendly and easy to understand. I am a Christian author and have referred to the Life Application Sudy Bible in the past to help with processing what I am attempting to help my readers understand. Bren Gandy-Wilson, author of ""Wno's To Say Cats Don't Praise"" and ""Women are Spiritual BRIDGES"""
1,Atrocious; Abysmal; Awful,"The scenarios in the game are pretty interesting but the near infinite bugs and pathetic frame rate make it impossible to begin to enjoy this craptacular waste of polycarbonate, aluminum and acrylic. Putting aside the technical problems, the game play is awful as well. The game has two difficulty levels with a normal game quickly degrading to constantly clicking yes or no on a helper box. On advanced, extreme micromanagement is required as you have to hire staff for every single oil well you put down. Do not buy this game at any price. In fact if you get this game for free don't even bother playing it, it really is that bad."
3,As light a historical take on Satchel as I've read.,this book is for teenagers who want to discover the great Satchel Paige. There are a half-dozen better biographies on him.
5,Throttle Depressor,"What can't you use this thing for? Testing brake lights, oh heck, I even us it to bleed brakes. Pump the peddle up and let the depressor hold pressure on the peddle while I open the bleeder."
1,Buyer Beware,What a disappointment! Only 2 songs out of 14 are the original recordings. There was no notice of this on the online description - very tricky label - and it is too late for me because my daughter opened the CD. What a waste!
4,Awesome Classic Music!!!,"Ever since I was a kid, I've loved music like this! My favorite songs are It's My Party, My Boyfriend's Back, Let's Twist Again, Wooly Bully, My Guy, and Leader of the Pack! I highly recommend the 60'S DANCE PARTY!!!"
1,picture does not match the product.,"I'm interested in the burgundy clear front report covers with three prongs, but the photo of the product in the ad is a pocket folder. I don't want to pay for the wrong item. Please advise."
4,You don't need to be a treasure-hunter,"This is a good read just to fire the imagination on a cold winter night. It's also a good one to get filled with bookmarks, margin notes, dog-ears, and fingerprints on the bookshelves of serious treasure-hunters. Buy it."
1,Good for those with below average intelligence,"I purchase books based on the brief story description provided to give me an idea about the book. I don't buy books depicting explicit sext. This book, though not graphic, dwelled on sex. The book started out with an interesting title and theme and the writer could have done a lot with the story but the writer kept getting side tracked by his constant backtracking in order to portray his fantasy sex starved woman.....it made the story stupid. I couldn't finish it and would get a refund if I could. If you have a below average intelligence you will probably like this book. Next time a book is reviewed, please review it correctly so I can avoid wasting my money on this tripe."
1,DON'T BOTHER,"I pride myself in taking a good deal of thought and preparation into writing my reviews.......unforunately this is all I can come up with:There is an old adage that goes, ""If you can't find something nice to say about someone, say nothing."" I extend that to be ""if you can't say anything good about a book, say nothing."" NOTHING!!!!"
5,One of his finest!,"My library consists of all of Father Greeley's fiction. I have loved every story and have found that generally all have happy endings. As I read CONTRACT WITH AN ANGEL I was saddened with the thought that the main character was going to die. I was in tears beginning in Chapter 29 when Raymond Anthony Neenan was dying. But, what a beautiful ending! The book has many lessons concerning personal relationships with God, family, and fellow workers, as well as getting in touched with one's self. This is one of his BEST! As usual there is a good mixture of human emotions. Thank you, Father Greeley, so many hours of pleasure reading. Keep the books coming!"
5,It's never too late to discover true happiness,"I just loved this book! I'm sure that if I knew that the novel was written by a priest, I never would have bought it... I'm so glad I did. Watching Ray discover what true happiness is all about as he trys to make ammends for his ruthless behavior, was a great trip.I have to admit, I found myself identifying with Ray and wondering if I could find such happiness with my own family if I focused more on them then on building my business.I enjoyed this book from cover to cover and would highly recommend it."
4,One of his very best!!,"In his charming and witty Irish style, he brought a different type of story with a surprising ending! It touches the heart and the conscience, and makes one question their own life and experiences; and let's us know that is never too late! Glorious!"
5,One of my top three of the thirty-nine read so far....,"I read somewhere recently that Fr. Greeley has written 43 novels. I believe it is closer to 53 if the truth be told. I myself have read 39 of them so far and this is one of my all time favorites. It is a wonderfully accessible story about the grace of forgiveness and of trying to do better every day, whether other people respond favorably to you or not. I could not recommend this book highly enough."
3,I liked it and would definitely recommend it.,"A good, fun read that surely uplifts your spirits. A book about redemption, reconciliation, and hope. This isn't the most fascinating book I have ever read. Some of it is downright silly. I also think Neenan's transformation was too easy to be convincing. We never really do see the earlier, nasty Neenan. However, if you can get over the premise and description of the afterworld, the book is quite fun and uplifting. Very different from the other Greeley books I have read."
5,Contract with an Angel: Best of Three!,"CONTRACT WITH AN ANGEL is the third in a series of three novels with an angel theme. If you're reading this review, you have probably read the other two: ANGEL FIRE and ANGEL LIGHT. I thoroughly enjoyed both of these novels and have recommended them to my friends. My friends who have read these novels have enjoyed them. Although ANGEL FIRE and ANGEL LIGHT are wonderfully written books, CONTRACT WITH AN ANGEL is even better!Why is CONTRACT WITH AN ANGEL better than the two other angel books? Greeley, a splendid author and a master of the written word, takes a creative twist within these pages. He turns the story of Faust on its head and pursues many unexpected turns and jolts. Greeley's crafty writing skills can be found in all his other books, but CONTRACT WITH AN ANGEL has more than witty writing, it includes the unexpected. It's a great book."
5,God Loves Everyone,"One of the things everyone would love to have is a second chance in life. Now God has given one man a chance to make up for the hurt he has inflicted in his life. What would you do if you knew that you have almost run your race and the finish line was close? Would you go on the same way or would you find that God loves you so much, that he will give you a chance to change your ways before your death and in the process find the love God has for all."
2,Great concept... poor execution,"The concept of this book is great, I was really excited to read this. But page after pageof sex followed, and school boy type attempts to make amends by the main character... didnot hold my interest. Too bad, it could have been a great book if there was better plot andwriting."
4,Great resource but out of date,"We were given this to help us prepare for a trip to Napa Valley and it has proved to be a good resource for the most part. The lists of wineries and information about them are extensive and the maps very useful - we didn't purchase another map or use a GPS for our stay - however the information about schedules and pricing is very out of date for almost every winery we considered visiting. If you intend to use this resource, be sure to check the winery websites before visiting - or else you might find that what you thought was a free tour is in fact $50 a couple and two hours later than you thought it was!"
2,Hmm...,"I know this is a loofah type pouch, but it's just too rough for my skin. Also, you have to use a pretty small bar of soap, otherwise it doesn't really fit."
4,music is important for relaxation,This box set of 4 cd-s is appropriate for mother and a child during breast-feeding.
5,Mama's purfume,I bought this for my neice who was having a wedding shower. This is the purfume her grandmother wore and she loved it. The bottle was full and the package didn't look opened. It was sent immediately.
3,Wrong perfume,"I ordered the wrong perfume, I thought it was Aqua Woman & so am not happy with my purchase. I understand if it cannot be returned, because I did take the cellophane off the box so I could smell it. If it is possible to return it, I would appreciate it. Regards, Elisabeth Gimblett"
1,"Pretty Much ""One Size Fits All"" Generic mats","I was quite sad after seeing the TV commecials and then looking at what I ended up with. This floor mat was SUPPOSED to fit a Civic. I should have gone to K-Mart and gotten some generic rubber mats. The fit would have been better.Customer service was crap. They said the web site explained you should buy custom fitted mats that were computer designed (at twice the price) if you wanted them to fit. They said the website had a disclaimer that noted they may not fit... which in reality is where their industry catch-phrase ""best fit"" comes into play. ""Best fit"" means they are not custom, but it is the best fit they can come up with without rubber hanging out your door.I would NEVER, EVER buy from them again. Even if you click on your car and model and year of make... THEY ARE NOT custom fitted mats. I would rate a zero if I could."
1,I'm not buying this!,"what a load of CLAPTRAP, January 9, 2003Reviewer: A reader from East CoastI laughed my guts out over this review! Thanks - I won't waste my money."
1,What's going ON?,"how did this get to be a best seller? Mr. Po doesn't have the slightest idea what he's talking about. It may be slightly more entertaining to read than what color is my parachute, but it's got no bearing on the real world. don't waste your time reading this ..."
1,What a disappointment!,"Bronson obviously wasn't interested in anyone who didn't graduate from college, I guess they don't ask these sorts of questions and who cares what they do with their lives, anyway. Apparently how much your life questions matter is directly proportionate with your education, how prestigious your college was, and your annual income. Oh yes, and you best be between 25 and 40. Those with a Wall Street background and/or politics are preferred. This struck me as interesting as those two groups more than any other can be held responsible for the mess we are all in and they, more than any one else, came out of it smelling like a rose. Boy, I sure want to emulate them! The author's superior attitude came through in his writing and I found his elitism insulting."
5,How the question arrives on your mind will often tell you 'What ',"Po Bronson's "" What Should I Do With My Life? "" , is a book that does this with journalistic finesse.The book never falls into the prescriptive trap of self-help books. The journey of what you want to be in your life, is a lot like a voyage into the unknown that has to planned ad infinitum. Bronson's story tellers are not those screaming out or intending to be the next big self-help author and their stories are intimate enough for us to learn from them,yet never enough to achieve closure. Every story almost ends like an incomplete thread. And in that incompleteness,you can find the message - Though the question is an ""Ultimate Question"" ;there is no "" Ultimate Answer"" !"
4,Trying but inspirational,"This is an astonishing collection of stories of ordinary people who ""had unearthed their true calling, or at least those who were willing to try."" They are stories of ""individual dilemmas and dramatic gambles,"" not always successful. The tales of the author's subjects are interesting, and at times, inspirational. Unfortunately, Po Bronson tends to intersperse his own story from time to time, making it more personal and emotional to him, perhaps, but distracting and often irritating to the reader. If one skips lightly over these interruptions, the tales of his subjects are fascinating, all the more so for being grouped together in one volume.Vaughan Evans, business and career strategistAuthor, BACKING U! A Business-Oriented Approach to Backing Your Passion and Achieving Career Success"
2,You won't find the answer here,"It's an interesting collection of stories selected more to get you thinking differently about your life than to inspire.If you are looking for ""the answer"" or the ""feel good factor"" you won't get it here. If you are looking for a different perspctive taken from real world examples it might be worth a read.I have rated it low because as a collection of stories its nothing special and does not have any real depth"
2,Save Your Money,"I am sorry but this book just didn't do it for me, I was disappointed in it. I must say the designer of the cover did a great job, it catches the eye and the title draws one in. However, this book had nothing of substance, nothing I found thought provoking. I tried hard to like it but ending up thinking, ""Why am I reading this thing""? I plowed through about 4/5 of the book and just simply could not take it anymore. Hopefully, someone at Goodwill will like it."
4,Lots of ah ha moments,"I've enjoyed the short chapters-each one a brief glance at those pivetal moments in one's life. I know I've had a few of those ""ah ha!"" moments that have so changed my course of life and career and I've many similar stories from friends and relatives. My only complaint is that sometimes Po Bronson feels the need to interject herself and question the wisdom and direction her interviewees take which is completely contrary to the spirit of the book!"
1,The most arrogant writer?,"The book could have been great--the topic has such potential to be entertaining and inspiring. I don't mind the armchair psychology and I like reading about life decisions of real people. The problem is that the author is so arrogant that the book quickly becomes annoying. By the fifth chapter, it was almost ridiculous how he would compliment himself. I was calling my friends and reading aloud the text, just to laugh at it. By the 10th chapter I had to put the book down."
1,Breaking new ground in self-absorption,"The book's subject is in constant conflict with the author's need to blow his own horn. The book should be retitled ""Can we talk about me again?"" It's rough sledding."
2,The TV Show Was Better Than The Book,"I ran right out and purchased this book after hearingabout it on Book TV. That will teach me NEVER to buya book without checking Amazon.com reviews. I find theseare very much to the point. I agree with the reviewerwho found most of the individuals profiled annoyingat best, disgusting at worst, totally self absorbedand that must be the common thread that inspired theauthor to interview these particular people. He alsodrifted often into his own story and I was not lookingfor nor interested in a biography. Watch for repeats onBook TV. That's all you'll need to experience about thisbook"
1,Upside Down,"Po Bronson is a publisher and a familiar person in Silicon Valley, and he has edited together some stories of people who somehow told him more about themselves than anyone needs to know.Neither they nor he have the answer, it seems, to the question in the title, because one can't find the answer in the stories of other people or the salads of editors. Especially when the stories do not form an oral history of anything. They are not teaching stories. They are like newspaper clippings. His book is a song of himself, told in adjectives. Turn back the clock to the nineteenth century. Read Twain and Crane. You'll get closer to answers that have worked."
1,THIS BOOKS ...,"TO ANY PERSON THINKING ABOUT BUYING THIS BOOK. SAVE YOUR TIME AND MONEY. IT WAS A TOPIC OF GREAT SERIOUSNESS FOR ME AND I PLOWED THROUGH IT. ONLY TO FIND THAT IN THE END, THEIR WERE NO ANSWERS. ONLY STORIES THAT WERE OF NO HELP IN ANY WAY.ALSO THE AUTHOR TAKES WAY TO MUCH TIME, TO MAKE THE SIMPLEST POINT, OR PAGES AND NO POINT AT ALL,JUST RAMBLING.I READ A LOT OF BOOKS. THIS RATES AS ONE OF THE WORST."
2,The Title is Very Misleading,"I bought this book thinking it would be something that would be helpful to learn more about myself, but instead it is just loaded with stories about other people. It was not helpful at all and was a waste of money. I think the author should change this title to Interesting Stories of People Who Changed Careers. Nice book if you just want to read about people in general, but not at all all helpful if you really want to work at discovering what you want for yourself."
4,One of life's important questions.,"Read ""What Should I Do With My Life?"" for a non biased look at one of life's biggest questions."
2,Read this book if you want to be depressed,"I'm sure that if you're an adult in today's world, and have an ounce of introspection, you've thought from time to time, ""what do I want to be when i grow up?"" And you've seen lots of happy-talk books, about people who tried to figure that out, and everything magically fell into place for them. Well, this is NOT one of those books. I had heard it was a more ""realistic"" book about people who tried to figure out what they wanted to do with their lives, but so far, it seems that 90% of the people in this book either never figure out what they want, or they don't get it. I am through only about 15 chapters in this book and unsure if I want to continue! makes me long for the happy talk books...upshot is, don't waste your money on this book, when you can depressed by watching the news for free!"
2,Rubbish for sadsack yuppies.,"I came to this book with an open mind, wanting to find these other reviewers were wrong about it. No such luck.In my progress through the book, I haven't read one profile where someone answered their question of personal meaning -- they're still looking. I finally got fed up after the third consecutive profile of a six-figure yuppie with an ivy league degree whose big-name job wasn't fulfilling them. Big freaking whoop, right? This just wasn't a helpful book at all, and it lacked the redeeming qualities of Bronson's prose in The Nudist on the Late Shift."
2,"Disingenuous title. Should be called ""Cute Little Stories of How Some Rich Overachievers Followed Their Dreams""","I listened to this book on tape during a long car trip. Instead of offering real vocational advice, as the title seemed to promise, all it presented was a series of biographical sketches and interviews with high-powered people who changed careers. That's inspirational as far as that goes, but it doesn't really provide any useful information that the individual reader could apply to his own life."
1,This was the first book I ever threw in the recycling bin,"I've read a lot of these books, and I read this one after it first came out (before all those negative reviews were posted). I was telling a friend about this book the other day, and told her that I never throw books away. But I threw this one into my recycling bin rather than donate it to the local library book sale, because I wanted to save another poor soul from reading this book. And then I realized that I could save more poor souls the trouble if I added my opinion here. This book is all about Po Bronson. Read Barbara Sher's or Martha Beck's books if you want some sound advice."
2,Answer: Spend it doing other things than reading this book!,"The title is what makes this book sell well, not the content. I was intrigued by the hope for personal stories that added insight to figuring out one's path. This book is so obviously a self-indulgent journey for Bronson, who often interjects his own advice to the subjects throught their stories. From they way it is written, one would think Bronson has all the answers and that each person written about is so glad to have gained such wonderful knowledge from him. I have never experienced an author come across so cocky. What makes him a guru of how to choose a career path? While some of the stories were slighty interesting to read, the lack of any useful information along with the grandiose way in which the author views his own opinion, I would recommend spending your time on something more productive."
2,Can't recommend it...,"I'm not even sure what the purpose of this book is. If it's meant to be a guide for people considering a change of careers, it fails. There's nothing here in the way of things to consider, questions to ask yourself, etc. But if it's just meant to be profiles of people who changed careers, it also fails. It sounds like all of these people have an interesting story to tell. But we never really get to hear too much about what they were thinking, or how they reached their decisions. What we do hear a lot about is what PO BRONSON thought about their situation, and how PO BRONSON contacted them, and what PO BRONSON learned from them, etc. That's when Po Bronson is not talking about moments in PO BRONSON'S life, and decisions PO BRONSON had to make. If he wants to devote one section to his own story, fine. But it seems like every story comes back around to PO BRONSON."
2,Could Be Much Better,I had reservations buying this book based on the reviews I read on Amazon. I decided to give it a try anyway. I am only on page 19 and I am already sick of the author's analysis of his interviewees' journeys. The author would have benefitted from reading Stud Terkel's book Working. Just let the people tell their own story without an unqualifed analysis or counseling session! Their own simple words would have been much more beneficial. Please spare me the ego!!!
4,An interesting idea,"""What should I do with my life"" is an interesting and very well timed book that made me think a lot about my own futur. The concept of collecting stories is quite interesting although I enjoyed some stories a lot more than others. The only downside is that the writer seems to think he has the answers to everyone's questions although he is trying to convince for the opposite."
2,Where are my people,"In theory, I should be the sort of person that Po is writing to and about - white, educated, middle-class - but I have to agree with the other negative reviews. The book is littered with MBAs, doctors, lawyers and the like who have made some sort of career transition. This falls so short of answering the ultimate question, but it also falls short of being an interesting career book unless you happen to be a banker or lawyer and you're looking to get off the fast track by BUYING A COMPANY that is a little more prosaic than what you did before, but nevertheless lucrative. I want to see stories of a ghetto kid who does NOT rise to become a doctor, but becomes a surfer and is happy. Something, anything, that doesn't sound so middle America as the stories in here."
2,Disappointing,"When I found this book, I thought it was going to be about regular people who hated there work and the steps they took to get to a better place. Instead, the author uses many examples of his own life which make the narrative sound arrogant and self-serving. This is made more irritating by the fact that his life isn't really that interesting to begin with. There are a few parts that have merit but the bulk of this book is pointless drivel."
1,When did Po become the story?,"The author would be better served sticking to novels. 'Bombardiers' was a great piece of work. 'The First $20 Million..."" was a good read as well. I can even stomach 'Nudist on the Late Shift' because it had some excellent reporting.But with this book, Po has clearly lost his way. As evidenced by the accompanying 'Fast Company' article, Po no longer thinks of himself as the writer. He nows sees himself as the central piece of the story. Further evidence was a recent San Francisco Chronicle article reviewing the book, replete with beefcake-like photos of the author and a 'review' that read something like a teenybooper scoring an interview with Justin Timberlake."
2,Reader from California,"After seeing the author and several of his subjects on Oprah, I bought the book. Unfortunately, the Oprah show made the book seem much more interesting than it really is. I found it boring, and the author's analysis of his subjects seemed forced and simply did not ring true to me. Overall, a disappointment."
1,What about the rest of us?,"This book is very narrow in it's cast of characters. Bronson would have all of us believe that only the super educated have problems with what to do with their lives and us blue collar types should.... well, he didn't even mention us. Read two chapters and you've read the whole book. Sorry I wasted the time and money."
2,"Cool concept, poor execution","While this book surely contains a few interesting stories, I just couldn't get over the arrogance and ego of the author. In way too many stories Bronson writes about how his own genius suggestion or question to his subject suddenly makes them have an amazing epiphany, like they've just been hanging out for 20 years waiting for a rich white guy to tell them to what to do. If Bronson stepped back out of the action and let the subjects themselves remain the story, this book would have been much stronger."
1,All About Po,"If you want to hear Po Bronson's value judgement about your choices in life, or anyone else's, buy this book. That is mostly what you get along with an incredible amount Bronson's egotistical commentary. Some of the storys were very interesting but Bronson interjected himself to the point of irritation and, in my opinion, belittled almost every one of his subjects. I've read reviews that criticize the book for being limited in its subjects (to over-educated white people), I'm one of those people and still couldn't stand to read it. Don't waste your money."
2,the underbelly of a weird subculture,"The reviews here of this book amused me as much as the book itself distressed me. Like Po, I'm a Stanford grad. Unlike Po, I'm about 5 years too old to have gotten in on the dot-com bubble. I graduated into a recession! The mindset of most of these disappointed dot-commers is quite familiar to me. It's a subcultural attitude that led me and many of my set of Stanford ""misfit"" friends in droves to the campus counseling center to examine our ""lack of ambition.""If you spend your late teens and early twenties ""searching for meaning,"" you can move on and pursue or attempt to pursue a suitable career path with an adequate balance of financial and psychological rewards. If you spend your late teens and early twenties indulging fantasies of unlimited riches and ""taking over the world"" with sandcastle businesses you end up having to do your young, strident phase in middle age!"
1,"No real Insight, No lessons learned","Just not a good book. Not very well written. No real insight, lessons learned, etc. Just not worth reading."
5,Riveting,"Inspring in a way that on Bronson can do. There are few who have the capability that this author has. This book offers much more than just pick me up, like the fact that it gives you a renewal of self love. This keeps you in the moment and brings new energy to the surface. Another recommendation is Dreams gateway to the true self."
4,THE question,"Mr. Bronson sheds some light on a question that troubles many of us. Is there anyone who hasn't struggled with it? Is there anyone who can say that they've never doubted the path they took?The book includes many stories about career choices and changes. The reader's task is to try to relate to the stories and come away with some sense of what might be needed in their own lives.An interesting and unique book worthy of reading.James Green, author of ""If There's One Thing I've Learned."""
1,What a miserable book!,Don't waste your money. Read the title. He has nothing to say that the title doesn't say.
2,What would Po Bronson do?,"After reading numerous reviews and after the NPR interview, I was really excited to read this book. In the end, it was nothing like I expected it to be. Instead of reading essays about career changes and interesting occupations, I felt like I was reading essays about what the author would do in each of the given situations. I find this to be rather arrogant given most of the circumstances. The book has much thought-provoking potential, but it falls way short. I found Bronson's observations to be a bit short sighted and not always on target. In the end, I was just annoyed. This definitely would have benefitted from a more ""hands-off"" approach on the author's part. What a disappointment."
4,anecdotal sociology,"The author evidently interviewed nearly a thousand people before selecting 50 odd stories to tell. While the selection bias is evident in the stories, overall it provides grist for the mill of ""how might I plan the rest of my life"". No answers but I wasn't expecting any. Were you? Some reviewers were bothered by the author's interjecting himself in the cast and into others lives. I found it humanizing. I supect the author is still wrestling with the what should I do with my life question himself, trying to decide whether to do social work or write. Stick with writing."
4,Peoples' Lives are always interesting,"This is NOT a career guide as described in the Amazon text above. To me this was simply a book about people. It is the people here who speak, not Mr. Bronson. He is being a modern day Studs Terkel perhaps, but this book let's a variety of folks talk about how they stumbled through their lives trying to figure out what gives them satisfaction, how to earn money, where to live et. Peoples'lives and struggles are always interesting, and sometimes their mistakes do not have to be our mistakes, but their lives can be inspiring nevertheless. This might be a nice gift for younger people."
4,We all face this at some point,"What Should I Do with My Life is a collection of personal interviews examining how people have answered this question and changed their lives. Many of the people in the book have different backgrounds, educations, and circumstances and came about their change in a variety of different methods. Some are stories of courage and some are stories of chance. Each story examines how the person arrived at their answer for their life. The stories include young people just starting out in their careers as well as older people looking to change careers."
2,It didn't work for me,"If you have an amiable or expressive social learning style this book would interest you. I have an analytical driver style so after the first chapter I was bored. I thought the book would be more like 'What Color is Your Parachute' or 'Whistle While You Work'. I expected some interesting means/methods to discover what I want to be when I grow up. If you find yourself lacking self-esteem or seek the comfort how others finds themselves, try this book. There was too much emphasis on the Generation 'Why' crowd in the interviews. Maybe the author feels more comfortable interviewing his generation."
4,"Thought-Provoking, Artfully Written","I've heard it said that you can tell by how someone writes whether they genuinely like people. Po Bronson clearly likes people, and it shines through in this book. I highly recommend it for anyone seeking to set foot in others' shoes, whether you are in the midst of self-examination (and shouldn't that be a constant for all of us, really?) or not."
1,Po-ly Executed,"As you read this book, it occurs to you that Po Bronson is nowhere NEAR as smart as he thinks he is. Of course, that only occurs to you after it dawns on you that he is a pompous idiot who thinks himself a genius. Isn't that the most annoying kind of idiot, after all?Anyway, Bronson apparently convinced some people to open up their lives to him so that he could either write annoying, limp-wristed paeans to them, praising their industrious souls or so that he could cruelly rake them over the coals and mock how lazy, stupid and spaced-out they are. After reading a few of his snide, superior, hyper-critical appraisals of peoples' lives, you begin to fantasize about the semi-talented Po Bronson getting the same treatment. If the quality of product reflected in this book is anything to go by, Po Bronson should have never ""changed course"" to become a ""writer.""Certainly not recommended."
2,Don't waste your life with this book!,"Short, sweet and just NOT worthy of an adult's attention.What appears to be a good insight into finding direction in your life is ACTUALLY a disconnected portrait of many people changing their lives. I felt the book just didn't come across as I had intended it too, and wound up feeling like I had just finished the supreme 'head scratcher' of all books.If you are looking for some direction or trying to facilitate some change in your life, do NOT waste your time or attention on this junk. It will only add to your confusion at an already confusing time in your life."
5,I can't believe the reviews are so negative,"Now, its true that the books is not principly about blue-collar types; but he discusses this fact at some length. And I think it applies equally to people of low and high incomes, I myself grew up in poverty and think it has a great deal of practical, grounded wisdom. Not sure whay all the abuse is about."
4,Insightful stories helped me,"A friend sent me this book, knowing that I, like many of the people Po interviewed, am asking that ""What should I do with my life?"" question. Some of the people, he talked to, admittedly, were kind of whiny, like the woman who dropped out of medical school because she discovered she would have to--gasp!--work with sick people. On the other hand, I found many of the stories inspiring and helpful, and they guided me back toward two of the career goals I had wanted to pursue in the first place--writing and the ministry. Now I'm taking more decisive steps in both those directions. Po worries in his book that he might be interfering in some of his interviewees' lives, but isn't that the whole point of the book? This isn't objective journalism, and he shouldn't try to make it such. I think he did a fine job, and he certainly helped me. Thanks, Po."
3,???,"It's not what I thought it was about. This book presents interesting stories about people searching for their calling but it's full of questions. Nothing in their life is resolved yet. Because the book covers many people, sometimes the story ends abruptly. If you're looking for inspirations, this book is not for you but if you're interested in just reading about their stories, this is for you."
2,Inconclusive,The book presents a large number of cases that are neither well-categorised nor described.
2,Don't look to it for the answers,"Trying to find your calling? Want more happiness and fulfillment in your life? You won't find it in this book. Bronson interviews a bunch of people who, for the most part, don't know what they want to do, and are still searching blindly.I have to suggest ""Finding Your North Star"" by Martha Beck for those who want more but aren't sure what. Then you can read this book for further motivation. But Bronson's book doesn't give t you those answers.The answers to the question, ""What should I do with my life"" lies in your heart, not this book. And Bronson doesn't tell you how to listen to your heart.And if there is any grammatical problems with this review, blame Amazon.com."
2,Boring romp,"If you read the Fast Company article profiling this book, then don't read any further. That article summed it up. It felt like Po went on a quest to find something truly meaningful in all his encounters with these people, but found little. I think his goal was simply ""write another book no matter what"" and so he did. Yawn."
1,Truly bad,"A true waste of time. I was given it as a gift and felt like I had to finish it. There is simply way too much amateur psychology in the book, and way too much PO in the book."
2,what should I do with my life,"Mildly complex, mildly amusing tales of (usually fairly young) individuals who are searching for the ""true"" story of their lives. They hope and long (consciously, but mostly unconsciously) to align their work lives and work-identity with a sought-after ""truth"" about who they really are. Most of the individuals in the book have obviously not done intrapsychic therapy work, and therefore have not learned that their stories (some long and complicated, some short and obvious) all revolve around family-of-origin themes. Most of the individuals in this book have not yet recognized that reality, and the author only addresses this important issue briefly overall. Too bad, because it would be a much more powerful and useful exploration of the search for meaning, if Mr. Bronson included more wisdom about the REAL underlying themes of the human condition."
1,don't spend any part of your life reading this book!,"Waste of time. I was not looking for any divine inspiration (luckily), yet, still was disappointed. The author gives too much insight on himself (he is self-impressed and boring), preaches about what the moral of each profile should be (which should be self-evident), doesn't provide a fraction of the success stories that the publisher's review promises, and has his ugly mug blown up on the back of the dust cover, so I had to put it face up all of the time. Very few of the profiles were of people who actually figured it out, mostly of people who made mistakes, which is not what I purchased the book for and was not the premise of the subtitle.I don't write book reviews, but this one stank so bad, I couldn't help myself. But, let me help you: don't do it."
1,What Should I Do With Po's Ego?,"This book was a terrible disappointment -- rather than thoughtfully exploring existential questions, Bronson supplants his subjects' stories with his own, constantly injecting his successful-millionaire-writer-who's-lost-his-way angst into anecdotes that might be insightful or instructive otherwise. Really, a waste of time."
3,What Should I do With the Rest of the Book?,"Were it not for a class, I wouldn't have bought Bronson's book. The concept of collecting stories of people who've made turnarounds in their careers to find others that are truly satisfying is great. But his often glib vignettes concern people in rather elite positions (e.g.,attorneys, physicians, Hollywood production supervisors). They don't represent the vast majority of people who lack such parachutes to save them from a fall."
2,"If you are over 35, don't bother...","Bottom Line-- If you are young, well-educated, and making lots of money on Wall Street or Silicon Valley, but feel you need some inspiration to decide on a life-purpose or direction, you might get something out of this book. Otherwise, I would recommend that you look elsewhere.If you are older, you probably know more about life than what is presented here. However, some of the stories are interesting, so if you like to read about young, well-educated, rich people and how they, too, struggle with life, go ahead and read it."
2,Disappointing,"When I first heard of this book on the Oprah Winfrey show (she devoted an entire show to it) I was excited and thought it would help me make a career choice, as I was unhappy with the education field. I promptly went online and ordered it. Unfortunately, when I started to read it I did not find anything that would help me make a career decision or give me inspiration. The book is filled with stories about individuals who were unhappy with their current careers and make a 360 degree career change. For example, the businessman who became a police officer, the surgeon who became a shoe designer, and the lawyer who became a cake baker. While the stories are interesting I didn't take anything away from the book that would help me in my own search for a fulfilling career."
5,Feeling restless? A must read...,"If you're feeling at all restless with your current professional situation this book is a must read. While the central message is fairly straight forward: discover for yourself what you *should* do with your life, and then DO IT, the stories are thoroughly engaging and thought provoking. This book is a giant kick in the pants to stop sleep-walking through a life that is comfortable yet passionless.Buy this book - for you, and for a friend (or two)."
3,"Po On The Mark, But Did He Adequately Research His Subjects?","I love the book, Po rocks! After reading the story of Deni Leonard, I had to check this story out. ... It looks like this guy's some type of criminal, not a Native American hero. I love the book, but this Deni Leonard guy is somethign else."
3,Read SB or God,"I cannot place enough emphasis as to how simple minded this book is. This book is based on a very unstable and short term premise. I was very impressed with the fact that a book like this got past the screening process. However advertising has made the difference here. Truthfully, very few persons in my opinion can benefit from this extremely over rated title."
2,Dissapointing,"I can't understand those that think this is an important book. I thought it would be an interesting study, so I kept reading, hoping that the next chapter would show people that knew what they wanted to do with their lives and how they got there. Instead, more of people with no idea. Directly after reading this, I read Michael Lewis' Moneyball. He presents person after person who knows exactly what they want to do with their lives. Great book, read this instead."
1,What Should I Do with My Life?,I do not recommend you read this book. It will not get you any closer to answer 'what you should do with your life'. You are likely to be disappointed.
2,Jack M. Zufelt,"Not bad --- just not new. Po misses the boat -- unhless you like stories. I am so tired of hearng the same old things about success and how we can make our lives what we want which is why I wrote the book, The DNA of Success.There is a better, simpler way"
3,Misleading Title hurts what could be a good book,"""What should I do with my life?"" by Po Bronson is not what the title suggests. The writer interviewed about seven hundred people who asked that question in life. He shares about fifty stories. Some are interesting most are boring or blah. Ultimately the title of the book is misleading as he never finds a clear answer or point of view and tries to create a connective tissue between the stories that does not exist. You pick up a book like that to be inspired but instead you feel like life is pointless by the time you finish reading it."
3,"Interesting, but needs an editor","This book suffers from an interesting conundrum -- the storytelling is great, but the writing is pretty bad. There's a horrific number of facutual, grammatical, and punctuation errors, and don't even ask about the mixed metaphors and senseless analogies. Many of the stories were compelling, but a more cohesive and less self-indulgent style would've made it even more of a page-turner.The author also seems to suffer from a weird, self-aggrandizing God complex that I found irritating as all hell. All in all, I'd take a strong storyteller over a pretty stylist, but it's annoying that such a highly lauded author isn't capable of both."
3,Asks this question of the privileged only,"I didn't like this book too much because Bronson only seemed to include Gen X uber-yuppie types who have trouble deciding whether to drive the Lexus or the Benz to work in the morning. Why couldn't he just profile a more realistic group of career thinkers who don't have to stand out in such an eccentric or stylish way? The profiles are still quite interesting, though I found the book to be somewhat shallow in the end. Bronson appears to take on a deeply philosophical subject but then fails to ask the right, probing questions of his subjects, and also fails to more fully develop these characters. Overall, I was quite disappointed. Avery Z. Conner, author of ""Fevers of the Mind""."
2,Wanted More In-depth Profiles,"No, I am not having a midlife crisis. This book was on my to read list, but I forget the reason why I added it. Po spoke with 800 some people for this book and it shows as he skims through their experiences - I wish that he had winnowed down the list and did some more in-depth profiles. I did like when he went beyond a page or two with a particular person."
1,A good title can sell an awful book,"I browsed this one in the library - and then berated the acquisitions person for wasting funds on it. Despite what the title implies, this effort is not the least bit insightful. The repetitive career-switch tales are more monotonous than interesting. Do not confuse this author with a ""writer"" - that term implies, at the very least, the ability to competently use the language and sensibly organize information. The only thing an intelligent person can take away from this book is that a catchy title and cover copy can sell any book - even if the text is garbage. Those 4 and 5 star reviews have to be bogus."
1,a dull experience,"I bought the audio version of this book because it was under five bucks and I was trying to get my Amazon total over $25 so I'd get free shipping. I should have just paid for the shipping. Not much to add to the many negative reviews other than to say it's read poorly as well as written poorly due to Bronson's somnambulent articulation and unflattering imitations of various interviewees' voices and supposed accents. I listened all the way through, hoping for a redeeming bit of insight at the end, but no such luck. At least the audio version was abridged."
2,yuppie transition UGHHHHHHH,"I picked up this book in the library because it sounded interesting. Bad move. This book shows stories of professional,educated white collar workers who decide they would like to follow their dreams and passions. This usually comes after a few years of gorging themselves on their six figure salaries,reveling in self-importance and pondering life's meaning. This low review is not indicative of Po Bronson though. I enjoyed his personal anecdotes and two stories in particular. The suicide story was really well written and the lawyer who became a truck driver was also. How are techies,investment bankers,and tax attorneys more interesting than ski guides and militia men."
1,One thing you shouldn't do with your life:read this book,"I was very disappointed with this book.The title and theme really grabbed me. What you will read are the ramblings of several peoples current life stories that are boring and unhelpful. It is like Po searched out a bunch of aimless people doing strange things.The bookis no help for a typical middle class person or a blue collar worker trying to get a foot in a new door. I am tired of publishers publishing books that never arrive at any point or recommended solution. Like the readers are just blessed to be reading stlye, good English, and punctuation. Where are the solutions?Or at least be thought provoking.This book was neither."
2,didnt buy,"to be honest, i was going to buy this book, i saw it in the bookstore, jumped through different sections, read several pages, then realized.....the title is a misleading. It should say ""what other people did"". And is that the type of book i was looking for....no. I found the book basically just detailed other peoples lives, and most of them that found success or happiness....seemed to fall into it by accident. There was no lesson here, or magical formula. Just luck."
1,Better to look elsewhere,"Po Bronson offers really no insight, and the writing drags and exhausts. I recommend readers to Working by Studs Terkel."
1,The Purpose Driven Life is a far better book than this one,I didn't get much out of this book. Save your money and instead buy The Purpose Driven Life: What On Earth Am I Here For? by Rick Warren. It is a far more helpful and insightful book in understand what you should do with your life. It came out about the same time as this book did.
1,Nice stories but no real answers to the question he poses,"I was disappointed in this book. I felt it was a bait and switch. Some of the stories were interesting to read, but at the end of book, I was thinking ""So what?"" Po Bronson is a good writer, and he interviews a lot of different kinds of people, but his insights are quite limited, and colored by his limited perspective. I agree with one of the other reviewers- I found The Purpose Driven Life: What On Earth am I Here For? to have a lot more meat to it. Bronson's book was entirely predictable."
2,Not Nearly As Good As It Sounds,"My subject says most of what I have to say. Great concept, but the presentations are all too muddled with Po's take. Obviously authoring such a book should involve some summary or takeaways, but really you just feel like you're in conversation with someone at a bar who won't stop talking and who keeps saying things you already get. The vignettes of real people are fun at some level, and I appreciate them, but getting through the book and Po's heavy-handed presence spoils the fruit."
3,"Good Read, Good Insights","For anyone in transition, Bronson's book does a great job of taking a broad view on approaches to finding your path, your life's work. And while I wouldn't consider it self-help (Bronson has as many questions as answers),the stories capture how varied and intricate the American work experience is. Bronson even steps into the book himself, telling his own story and critiquing his own path. Ballsy to be dropping the aloof objective view. This addition rounds out the experience: instead of blindly enthused to conquer the world or so beaten as to think no hope exists, What Should I do with my Life left me satisfied understanding a little better my place in the world knowning how much variation in paths exists."
4,On the Road with Career Discussions,"The title of this book is a little misleading. This is not a how-to book and won't help you find the answers to your personal career questions. What the book IS is an engaging, inspirational series of interviews or individual stories about people who have found their calling by listening to that inner voice, some who are still searching, and some who stumbled into their life's calling accidentally even when it was in front of them all along. This is not a book to be hurried through all at once, although the reading style is very easy and down to earth. Rather, each person's story should be read and digested on its own merits."
5,This book is inspirational.,"I have been at a cross road in my career for a long time and this book helped me to muster the courage to make a change. When I read that other people in worse positions did it, I realized that if they could do it so can I. Don't expect this book to be a how-to book, just let it motivate you to take the next step. I recommend two books for the how-to part: Optimal Thinking: How To Be Your Best Self which helped me to define my ultimate purpose, put the optimal plan together, take the best steps and make the most of every situation. And, What Color is Your Parichute is a wonderful book to help you go right through the process of job change from resume to interview."
4,Recommended by Breeder,"I bought a Vizsla puppy from a breeder who raises hunting dogs in WI. These are high activity dogs. This was the food he recommended. I've fed my puppy this since I've had her. She's an energetic, healthy dog. I would say the taste must not be great; she doesn't wolf it down when I feed her but she will eat it."
4,good gift!,I gave 2 of these as Christmas gifts this year. One to a 13 year old boy and one to a 15 year old boy. Both seemed pleased and interested in this and were tring to do tricks with them before they left my house. I can't vouch for the longevity or durability of the yo stick but at least it wasn't a gift that got set behind the couch and not commented on for the rest of the day! With teenagers I consider that a success!
4,Stanley tool book review,"This book comes in real handy when trying to identify correct cutters for a Stanley 45 plane. Gives enough details and drawings to help make sure I get the correct parts or show whats missing before I buy one. So many incomplete or wrong parts put together on these tools that are for sale, that it can be real confusing at times. The Stanley 45 plane was made between 1882 and the 1960's and many of the parts are interchangable. I bought a plane from WWII era and it came with a box of cutters from 1882 era! Would also recommend Book by David E. Heckel."
4,great music,I bought this cd as a gift and the person loved it! brought back memories from the past...can't do any better than that if it puts a smile on someones face! thanks for the help
5,Killing Raven -- a great addition to the series,"Margaret Coel's books about the Wind River Reservation are exciting, psychologically valid, and deal with numerous issues that are very current as related to present-day concerns on Indian Reservations. This one deals effectively and with sensitivity with the issues raised by casino gambling, a major concern for many people, both Indian and non-Indian."
5,filter,I have spent a number of years in the automotive industry and I learned a long time ago that the k and n filter line was a top notch product. It provides superior filtering while allowing better air flow which gives a slight increase in performance. Another feature is the filter is reusable after cleaning and oiling. Over the long haul the benefits will mean savings in fuel costs and savings in not having to purchase replacement filters. This filter was an exact replacement for the oem filter in my vehicle and does not effect any factory warranty. I highly recommend the use of k and n for any vehicle.
1,Not for BMW K1200LT,"When I did search for K1200LT parts, this shows on the list. THIS IS NOT FOR K1200LT. Unfortunatly I didn't find out till much later."
5,The filter of choice for me,"Not because it is ""better"" and a K&N, but the nut on the end makes my life so easy when changing the oil on my motorcycle. Why the hell can't all the competitors do this as well?"
1,Didn't fit my Polaris Sportsman 400,I bought one of these for my Sportsman 500 and it worked fine. Bought another one for my Sportsman 400 and it didn't fit despite Amazon saying that it would. The threads weren't right. Thankfully I gave up trying to force it on before I stripped the male threads on the machine. Went to NAPA and bought their filter and it screwed right on.
1,Doe not fit my bike,"This was listed as an item that worked with my BMW R1150R, however is was way to small. Now I am stuck with it, since I waited until my next oil change was due :)"
1,Gasket Type,"I was having trouble finding an actual Polaris filter for my 2012 Sportsman so I decided to try these out. At 10 hours after installation the filter had vibrated loose to the point that the engine lost quite a bit of oil. The filter had been tightened to spec. After replacing with a OEM filter I noticed that these filters have a ""round"" gasket while the OEM filters have a ""flat"" type gasket. I think the flat gasket may provide a better grip for the filter. This may not be a problem in all applications but I would be cautious of using this part on a Polaris bike."
5,K&N KN-303 Motorcycle/Powersports High Performance Oil Filter,I had to change the oil and oil filter corresponding ... I actually always used K & N and have not regretted it ... It is Excellent!
5,No complaints,"I've been using this filter on my 02 R6 for the last 5 oil changes, no issues. The hex nut makes it super easy to remove."
5,Best damn filter out there!,"Makes oil changes much easier, if you have ever driven a screw driver through a filter to get it off you'll truly appreciate the nut on this filter for removal.All testing I've seen show this to be one of the superior filters available as well.Hell, if your spending the cash for synthetic oil for your V-twin, get a good filter to go along with it and buy on Amazon for the best price out there."
5,The best motorcycle oil filter on the market,"K&N makes a great filter that is by far the easiest to change. By adding the metric hex nut on the top of the filter, it makes it the easiest filter to change on most motorcycles."
4,good...but no cigar,"this was a pretty good book, i love the descriptions. but this is not the type of book i usually read. i really love the cover, and it was worth reading...but not superb."
3,A good read if you like nature,"The Spirit Window was a good book but it could've been better. The story focused mostly on 15 year old Miranda's relationship with 18 year old Adam and the plot basically revolved around their relationship and Miranda's father disliking Adam. I would recommend this book to people interested in nature, but if you are reading for pleasure, this book would not be a very good choice."
4,HOW IS LIFE EFFECTED,"The book ""the spirit window""is an awesome book which shows different relationships between families.This book had surely done a magical cast on me of looking at our own relatives and trying to understand the secrets of life. The book carries very fastidious and authentic facts, which inspires every person at every part of the body! This book is officially for readers of all age. For a remarkable day we should all read it and for the clandestine love in our hearts for our friends and families."
3,"great song, poor disc","I loved this song and video. However, this disc just has the radio edit: no extended version was ever made. This is a shame too. I guess many artists don't put effort into extending ballads, still this would have allowed fans and admirers to think of all the people with whom they fell out of love. Annie looks splendid in the dress on the cover of this disc. By the time of this album, the group was really falling apart and this lackluster CD hints at that. Still, if you worship Miss Annie you may want to own this just on principle."
3,INTERESTING,ITS THE ALBUM WHERE THEY BIZARRELY GO ALL NEW ROMANTIC ON US. ITS A BRAVE ALBUM BECAUSE THEYVE NEVER DONE ANYTHING LIKE IT BEFORE AND PROBABLY WONT AGAIN. PARADISE IS THE BEST TRACK ON IT. IF YOU LIKE YOUR DURAN DURAN BUY THIS BECAUSE ITS A SLICE OF UNDERRATED NEW ROMANTICISM!
5,Recap,"When this album first came out, I had already collected all of their previous recordings. For some strange reason, the 'album' itself became warped, and I never took the time to replace it. Now, many years later, I was able to download most of the songs from ""Morpheus,"" only to discover that Morpheus wreaked havoc on my computer. So now, I'd rather have my own updated CD. I remember these songs as I did years ago..I look forward to receiving it, hearing it again, and again. It is a classic!!!"
5,"Good Album, Bad Reputation","Although recognized as a badly done album, but in fact it's good! Becuase people were used to listening to the great disco songs, so when all the sudden the style of the Bee Gees had changed, they weren't ready, but also because of the hate of disco. All tracks in this album shows a special feeling that comes from the music. For example, Be Who You Are, it may sound boring at the start with all those strings, but the main chorus is absolutely heart-touching. Fanastic album to listen to, better find one!"
4,Functional and Durable,"Hamilton Beach CPM700 Commercial Stand Mixer, SilverI bought this mixer when I had a baking business making about 50 cakes plus many pounds of cookies a week. It is the 4th mixer I bought after I burned through 3 others. Most people don't need to have as large a bowl but if you do, I would recommend this one over the Kitchen Aid and definitely over the Viking I had. Most importantly it has an automatic shut off when the motor gets overheated, which the others do not. It doesn't offer a splatter shield, but it is the exact shape as the Viking so you can order one from that company and it will work fine. The warrantee is not as good as the Kitchen Aid which automatically sends you another within days, but it also is more durable if you are doing some heavy duty baking."
4,blue disco ball earrings,"These earrings are small and cute, great if you like hook earrings with small dangle. Blue color is good, I would purchase again."
1,7/16'S?????,"I GUESS I WAS NOT PAYING TO MUCH ATTENTION TO WHAT I WAS BUYING WHEN I ORDERED THIS TOOL IT IS A HEX SHANK EXTENSION FOR HOLE SAWS, AUGER BIT, ECT, COMES WITH A 7/16 HOLE FOR YOUR BIT TO GO INTO. I HAVE ALOT OF HOLE SAW BITS AND AUGER BITS BUT NONE OF THEM ARE 7/16 SHAFT WHICH MAKES THIS TOOL COMPLETY USELESS. GOING TO SEND THIS BACK!!!!"
1,Shipped the wrong one... twice,"for the second time now that I have ordered the SC-505 that is not the stopwatch I recieved. I recieved th 505W which is not even similar. It counts fewer laps and only measures to 1/100s rather than 1/1000s that the 505 measures. Don't know where to find this actual watch, but clearly ordering it will not work"
3,Cute but not what I thought they would be.,These boots are cute but too long and pointy. I got a size eight because with pointy boot normally they run tight at the tip. The size eights are huge. I have other size eight boots that look like these and they fit great. So just a heads up pick your true size or a smaller size.
3,Works,The device itself works fine. The problem I have withit is in setting the torque value. The gradients done seem to be lined up properly. There ae values on the handle that can't physically be accessed. Not sure that what I have dialed in is the torque I'm actually getting.
3,50/50,"Well...one out of two worked well. The other one continuously cycled power and wouldn't stay running for more than 5 minutes.Unfortunately, Technology Galaxy wouldn't return the second unit since it was 40 days after purchase and their policy is only 30 days...even if it sat in a box at our facility for the first 35 days. I'd buy another switch, but I'd never buy from this vendor again."
2,"Fine for aching calves, not so much for aching feet","I received this for Christmas after always asking my husband for foot massages. I tried it out with huge expectations that it was actually going to massage my feet. For some reason, it either hurts them or barely touches them. I wear a ladies' size 8, so I think my feet are fairly normal as far as size goes. When I put my foot in, I can't put all my weight onto my foot or the pressure is too much. Also, full leg wight pushes the thing away from me so I have to keep scooting it back. Alternatively, holding my leg up so my foot feels good makes my leg tired! This thing is AWESOME for massaging calves, but forget the feet. I am going to buy a $30 water massager and watch sadly as my $250 ottoman collects dust."
3,Haven't used it yet,I'm trying to reteach myself tatting. Got this book because it was the only one I found that looked like it might help.
2,OKAY...,"This Bon Jovi song ""It's my life"" is okay, at 1st I liked it, then I didn't cuz I started hearing it everyday on the radio, then I did, and now I kinda don't. I want to give it a 2.5 stars. I'm not that familiar with Bon Jovi's old stuff, so I really can't compare, It's okay though. But it has this annoying sound effect thing thats like ""WOW WOW"" in the backround and I hate that!"
5,My puppy LOVES this toy!!!!!!,Out of all the toy's I've bought her (and there's a lot of toys!!) This is her favorite!! It's great for teething which she's doing a lot of even at this very moment ;0p the only concern I have is the strings.. she loves the strings but they do tend to un-tie and fall off so you should definately supervise with this one unless you take the strings off then you should be good..buy it on Amazon way cheaper then Petsmart where I got mine ;0)
3,Great most of the time without the ties,"By itself, the bone is a great chew toy. The first one I had lasted for about 4 months of chewing. The newest one I purchased, however, has lasted about 4 days. I would still purchase this again on the off chance that it was just that one bone that didn't live up to my expectations. Just make sure not to let your dog chew on the ties. The first time I purchased this bone, my dog constantly untied them and I continued to tie them back on with double and triple knots to see how long they would last. Eventually I just took them off and threw them away, not realizing that one was missing. Turns out she had eaten it and it was in her stomach for probably a month before she threw it up one day. It explained the mystery of why she was having horrible digestive problems for a month."
2,"Laces Come Off, Bone Fell Apart",My Maltese got the strings off of this thing and even chewed off a piece of the blue bone before I noticed. Be careful with this one.
4,Great chew toy for puppies,"I've been using this and a kong jack type toy as my border collie's main chew toys. They both hold up really well. He preffers the Orka bone for solo-playing since it doesn't roll like the other toys. At about 3 months old, my BC was able to start destroying any cloth or rope toys pretty quickly, but his ORKA bone has no real wear yet."
5,Amusing and durable,"I have two Jack Russells who LOVE to chew and tend to destroy toys because of it. This toy is amazing, it took them forever to finally chew a corner off. They've had it for probably about 7mths and haven't done any more damage to it. The only down side is that the strings kept coming off, I finally took them away so they didn't try to eat them!"
2,Not very durable,"I bought this for my miniature dachshund puppy and he managed to destroy it in a few days. Definitely not what I had in mind. On the positive side, he loved chewing on it. It's just unfortunate that it didn't last longer."
2,Sharp teeth cause ring with string to break,"Our yorkie puppy does indeed love this toy. Unfortunately, he chewed one of the strings off and began to choke on them.We removed the other two strings. And it left a ring, he chewed off the ring in two pieces and began to choke on those. As one solid piece it is fine, but the extras are a choking hazard for small dogs with sharp teeth."
3,decent,My 14 week old Yorkie loved this thing! He would sit and chew on it for hours. After about a week he had broke through and started to get one of the corners off so I had to take it away.Also.. I got it at target for under 4 bucks. Target has the best prices for dog toys I have found.
2,Not for chewers,"Brought this home on Sunday afternoon, threw it away on Wed morning. 2 dachshund pups (8 mo) and this was edible in no time. Only buy this for dogs with puppy teeth."
4,Nice Mount for the Price,I looked around quite a bit looking for a replacement for my radar detector mount. This one is a great price and works well except for the velcro strips which come off after a short period of time. To be fair I have to mount my detector upside down which puts more force on the velcro adhesive than normal. I just added a velcro strap around it to hold it. Windshield suction is very good.
4,Great! Can be used to mount almost anything!,Great! Can be used to mount almost anything! I bought it to mount a radar detector but the mount that came with the radar was acceptable. So i use it to hold a switch box that controls my add on's. When people look thur the window they tend to think my car is a undercover police car! It can be used for almost any application!
1,useless with a radar detector if you have a steep windshield.,Didn't work in my Pontiac. The angle made the the mount block the detectors forward view.
3,Great little sucker,"Well made, great suction, adjusts 90 degrees but if your windshield has alot of rake it will block any signals coming from the front of the vehicle. If you are using it for a GPS antenna or XM/Sirius antenna would work well."
2,Too short on solution,"I must admit I am disappointed in this book. I expected more. A far better book on Internet safety is ""Life and Death on the Internet"" by Keith Schroeder. ""Life and Death"" is actually used as a training manual in many police departments and the Criminal Justice Dept at Indiana University, where I first read ""Life and Death"". ""Life and Death"" is helpful to parents while ""Cyber Crime"" spends too much time preaching about the problem without providing adaquate solutions."
3,Mediocre.,"As my title says: mediocre. This album is just that, nothing new or extra pleasing here.This is a 2fer1 combining 'The Sweet Life' and 'The Cisco Kid' originaly released on the Groove Merchant label.The standout track is 'Inner City Blues' which you can find elsewhere, on a number of compilations, for example (Pulp Fusion comes to mind on Harmless records). There is a nice cover of 'Superfly', and the tune 'Cisco Kid' isn't bad at all either. But the rest is pretty forgettable. Try to seek out his 'Blue Break Beats' CD - it is much more adventurous and exciting - and pass this one on."
5,This is the belt I have been looking for.,Belt has a slight stretch making it very comfortable to wear at a reasonable price. I would recommend this belt.
2,kind of misleading,"The amazon description was:leatherCasual fashion belt that moves with you and conforms to the waistExpands approximately 1"" without extra tabs or attachmentsPadded leather tabs and loopSatin silver finished buckleWear with jeans or sportswearThe first Item ""Leather"" is misleading, the belt actually states ""Genuine Leather with Bonded Lacing made in china""So the only real leather part is the portion on both ends that buckle together, the mesh or majority of this beltis in fact not real leather at all. That would probably explain other reviewers comments about longevity and stretching!Had I known it was primarily bonded I would have chosen something else."
3,PRETTY GOOD,ACTUALLY RATHER COMFORTABLE AND GIVES SUPPORT WITHOUT THE TIGHTNESS ONE OFTEN FEELS WITH A BELT.I WOULD RECOMMEND IT EASILY WITHOUT ANY TREPIDATION.
3,A liitle too much give.,ok - comfortable and looks good - but if you really need a belt to hold up your pants; this has too much give.
1,very poor quality product,I purchased this belt (a Lee Jeans Men's Comfort Stretch Braided Belt) on 7/11/2008 and threw it away 7/25/08 because it had lost its stretch after several wearing and became too long to wear.Definitely a product of inferior quality.Roger V. Rowe
4,just fine,"This is a good belt and has a nice look too.You could use this for anything,work or casual.I'm wearing a 36 now and that is this belt size and it fits well."
1,Defective design,"The elastic wire inside the leather weave on one side broke...your belt basically becomes a slinky at that point. Took me a while to figure this out and the time for me to return it elapsed. Loved the belt, bad design."
5,Excellent belt,This is an excellent belt. It looks dressy and it stretches so it's very comfortable.
3,Only OK,"This is a very nice looking belt.However, if you have relatively narrow hips it will not provide much support."
2,No Good if you don't have a waist!,"My personal shape is, um, outward bound at the waist. Convex. Some might say ""fat"".This belt is attractive and well made and easily a terrific value at the price. It is also extremely comfortable -- until I move.If I move it turns out to be too stretchy and too easily convinced by that bad boy, Gravity, to abandon its duty of holding my pants up. Both it and my pants go south and my hands must become occupied at constantly chasing after and returning both pants and belt to where they belong.I love this belt but cannot use it. At least until I loose a few inches. Wish me luck on that and skip this belt if you don't have a waist."
4,Great Christian Metal Band,"These guys remind me a lot of Queensryche and their guitar shredding reminds me of earlier Malmsteen. Do I think they are the premier Christian Metal band? No, but they rank up there, not quite with Styper or Eternal Decision but they have held their own. If you like the Metal of the late eighties and early nineties you will like these guys. Although I don't like everything they put out I believe they are a solid Christian band that has a great message. They don't hide their message, they are bold about God and they are very truthful in their lyrics. I would recommend this group to anyone and I own their first 3 cds and I have listened to them over and over again and I still enjoy them. Before you buy be sure to listen to every track because it may not suit what you are looking for but I believe you won't be dissatisfied with them."
5,Awesome,"For Christmas I gave my 3 sons and their wives a iRobot Roomba Vacuuming Robot, they have gone on and on about it. Now I am wanting one since it works so well. Thankfully one of my sons asked for it for Christmas it was a gift that was a great hit."
5,Roomba,"Wasn't sure I would like it, but after seeing the results, I was very impressed. Doesn't eliminate the need to clean or do a thorough vacuuming, but it does a very good job in between, especially when you don't have time. Grandkids just love to see it go and are always asking to use it. You MUST clean it every time between uses. It picks up so much that it gets full every time. On carpet it literally sucks up the fibers. About every 3rd or 4th time I have to do a thorough cleaning of the unit because hair will get stuck in the rollers, just like my regular vacuum cleaner. But it is easier than my regular vacuum to take apart and put back together."
2,Robo Vac,"The unit itself works fine but the remote still does not. I contacted Amazon they would not help, they told me to contact the manufacturer. I still have not gotten any word from them."
3,You get what you pay for,"This is my second remanufactured Roomba. The first one arrived with a battery that overheated. This one arrived with a bashed-in screen. The people at Roomba were not particularly helpful and suggested I return the entire product to Amazon because of a $2.99 broken part. The second time I called, the woman in customer service informed me the part was out of stock when I tried to purchase it. The third time I called, the customer service rep. sent one out for free, no questions asked.If you love the Roomba product, which I do, and are willing to go through the hassles of dealing with their customer service department, this is a good deal. I have two of these little machines, and they do a great job of picking up the dirt that my puppies track in.They do need a fair amount of maintenance though, so anyone who is not into taking things apart and putting them back together would probably not like this product."
2,No good if you have longhaired pets,"Have a longhaired pet friend? Forget this Roomba. The long hairs will get stuck in the brush, and more problematic, in the bearings. The bearing locks up and breaks. This is what happend to me 10 minutes into the first run. Now I have to service the bearing every 10-20 minutes.Even if it doesn't break, you will probably end up spending more time cleaning your Roomba than it would take you to vacuum the floor with a good old vacuum cleaner anyway.It does actually clean when it works, but I wish it had been a bit more gentle with the furniture. This Roomba is not a keeper."
2,Stay with a new machine,"I have a Roomba at my office, and I love it. I decided to try this remanufactured one to take home. The first time I turned it on it seemed to run fine, but then it started this intermittant shuttering, usually after bumping into things. My other Roomba never did this. I turned it off and packaged it back up and sent it back. I probably would have been fine keeping it, it did pick up like it should. It just sounded funny compared to my new Roomba. I am going to buy a brand new one now, remanufactured wasn't worth the savings I would have experienced. But I do love Roombas!"
5,Roomba,"Whewww! I gave my single daughter a Roomba for Christmas. I was nervous because it's like giving someone a scale and bottle of mouthwash as a gift. She has a shedding dog and her floors were always hairy. And when she opened it she asked if she could return it. I told her to try it first. Now she won't live without it and has named it ""Ron"". She and her roommates find themselves talking to ""Ron"" at times. Her friends even comment on how clean her hardwood floors are now."
2,One good thing about this item...I didn't pay full price,"Arrived broken, gets stuck in tight spaces, not good for rugs with tassles, blows dirt around on hard floor, and dropped some of its debris when it hit a bump. Oh, and if you want customer service from the manufacturer, prepare to wait on hold for a long, long time."
2,iRobot Roomba,"The unit seems to be eratic in its behavior and I am not sure that it is working properly. Product fails to meet my expectations for what it is advertised to do. Does not clean area completely, does not find its way back to the home port, gets caught in certain areas, seems to have eratic charging behavior. Also no parts list supplied with unit to order replacement parts such as edger brush, filters, and battery. Not up to the standards I would expect for the product."
2,Needs lots of help,"My home is only 600 sf with mixed hardwood and low-pile carpets, but Roomba has only managed to find its way back to its charger/base once in over two months of daily use. Although I clean it out after every use, it gives up and stops in its tracks if the roller and/or wheel mechanisms get too wound with dog or cat hair; if it finds itself with one wheel on a rug and one on a floor; and sometimes for no apparent reason at all. Customer support from i-Robot has been virtually nonexistent.It's a fun toy, but I would not buy it again."
3,not for everyone,The vacuum worked ok but it damaged my $20000 travertine floors. The front wheel needs to be redesigned or coated with rubber. Hard plastic spinning on a stone floor is not a good design.
1,misled,When I purchased this item I did not see anywhere that it was remanufactured. I've never had any luck with remanufactured items. We'll just have to wait & see how long it lasts.
1,Died within 3 weeks.,"""Remanufactured."" I should've known better. The vacuum did great for the first couple of weeks, and we were careful to maintain and clean the bin and all that. Then it started going in circles and staying in the same spot for an hour. Manufactured in China...what a surprise."
1,Changed our lives!,"I was skeptical about this product even after clicking ""buy"". But while it's not perfect, it has done wonders for our house! Set it to go right after I head off to work... It goes under most of the furniture, cleans until its batteries run out, and makes our floors look nice and clean. It does far better a job than I ever thought possible. Plus, it secretly makes YOU clean up a bit to take care of things it might get caught on (great for lazy folks like us who can appreciate the ""leaverage"" of a few minutes of cleaning)"
3,Works great.........but for only about a year!,The Roomba works great. I have 2 dogs and would set the Roomba Scheduler to vacuum my family room every day. It got dog hair up with no problems. It was awesome. But.........after about a year it started to have mechanical problems.
2,"Bad Battery-""Customer Service"" is NO help.","I bought a Roomba because I have two pets in a one bedroom apartment. I loved it...until a month later the battery won't hold a charge. I contacted ""customer service"" and they said they would send me a new battery. Then they tell me the next day that all their batteries are back ordered and they don't have any to ship. They also don't know when they will get any. That was a month ago and now I have an expensive paper weight in my kitchen.I would revise this if they follow through with their promise to fix the situation. So far, it looks like they have no intention of sending the battery they promised. I would not recommend this to anyone because they cannot stand by their product."
1,do not buy! waste of money!,"We paid $350 for the 4230 scheduler 14 months ago and this week it completely died. We took good care of it - cleaning the brushes, filters, bins, and even buying a new battery for it because the battery died after 11 months (yes, be aware that the batteries for these things will last maybe a year). Support only offered us a discount on a new roomba because our warranty had expired. I'm not planning on giving any more money to iRobot, and you shouldn't either."
2,Buyer Beware,"This is a great little vacuum especially on hardwood, tile, or any other smooth floor. It will never take the place of a conventional vacuum but does a great job during the ""in-between"" times. My cats just watch this little guy work from a distance. It really works as advertised.So why do I rate it only 2 stars ??? The battery has a very limited life and are very expensive. When new it seems like it would run forever on a single charge. Each subsequent use the batterys' capacity is reduced slightly and before you know it, it will barely last 15 minutes and the warranty period is up. I'll stick with the upright sweeper for now and put roomba in storage until the battery issue is resolved."
2,Stopped working after,"I liked it until it stopped working. We used it infrequently . . . my husband was a bigger fan than I. And, after no more than 6 uses over a period of 4 years, it simply stopped keeping a charge. In addition, the robot is rather noisy on hardwood floors (not so much on carpet), and more cute than thorough (misses under some furniture and in some corners). But, when it worked, it captured most of the dust, ash, cat hair, and grit that finds its way onto our floors every day. My biggest complaint (until it stopped altogether) was that the filter had to be manually removed after every cleaning; that's a dirty job, but no worse, I suppose, than removing a vacuum bag."
4,Crusade for cleaner floors.,"I bought the Roomba based on my positive experience with the Scooba. This was an opportunity to try it out (remanufactured) without the full-price investment. They definitely do clean and do so without kicking up dust and dirt into the air as happens with sweeping or using a traditional type vacuum that exhausts a lot of air. However, on the remanufactured device I noticed some broken clips out of the box and the battery does not last even a full hour. The replacement should arrive in another day and we'll give it another try."
2,Missing Parts,The shipment arrived on time but when the box was opened the remote was missing and I ended up having to purchase another one. An inventory should be made before the item is shipped to ensure all required items are present.
4,Roomba Baby,My robot is fantastic. It goes all over with no supervision except that I have to keep the two mini daschunds from trying to pick it up all the time. They think it is a toy for them although it is bigger than either one of them. Roomba does a good job of picking up all sorts of dog hair and other things in between regular weekly vacuuming.
3,Robo needs better instructions,"Needs more complete instructions on: vert. walls (radius & direction, does the infer red reflect off walls)"
3,Roomba. Great for pet hair!,"I purchased a Remanufactured IRobot Roomba. I have had it one month and had no problems with the unit. It does a great job on my tile floor picking up the tons of dog hair that my Lab leaves behind. The carpet is another story, it does make a little difference, but I still need to vacuum on the carpet often on top of what the Roomba does. It it wonderful on the tile though. I hardly have to sweep at all myself, only if I want it done quick do I bust out the broom. This little guy takes 45 min to what I can do in 5. It is fun to watch and my dogs are starting to get used to the loud noise it makes while it works. It does actually vacuum, and needs to be cleaned out after every cycle."
4,Cleans great and easy to use,"This is a great product that any house with a pet should have. It is easy to use and does a nice job cleaning. It isn't perfect, but it does a nice job in between regular vacuum cleanings.The only fault that I have found is the way in which hair and carpet fibers get caught on the rollers. You have to cut the wound pieces to remove them. If it wasn't for this, I would give it 5 stars."
3,Refurbished Roomba,"It was difficult to rate this item any higher because I got one that was defective & had to send it back. The cleaning was not in question, but the dirt bin kept falling off. I had had an original Roomba & wanted to update."
1,"Just a novelty, doesn't clean","I'm a gadget guy. I've owned 3 of these now. Each time I hope the upgrades will be great. They simply don't work. The roomba cannot find its way back to the charger, and you spend the evening playing find the roomba. There is next to no vacuum power, but the exhaust is just enough to blow the dust bunnies and cat hair under the furniture. The little rotating ""corner"" brush flips crumbs like a hockey puck to the far corners of your room. It leaves little piles of debris in the crevice of the threshold and next to the area rug or kitchen mat. Pet hair and dust get inextricably wound in the brushes. Roomba can't seem to climb onto an area rug from the bare floor, but has managed to tumble down the cellar stairs more than once. It won't pick up cereal or kibbles or chips, and when I put a pile of dust in the center of the floor to test it, it only found half of it.It's a neat gadget. It just doesn't clean. Don't waste your money."
4,Good intelligent robotic sweeper but not perfect,"I just got my roomba 4230 package from Amazon. The Roomba 4230 works great cleaning my house and is intelligent enough to navigate around an obstacle course I call a home. It picks up alot of dirt and debris. I definitely recommend it.I only have a few gripes about it:-The debris bin is not big enough so it has to be emptied often, maybe once per day.-It does not pickup bigger pieces of debris like a quarter size piece of paper.-It will get tangled up on adapter cords if it runs across them-It has trouble finding its recharging base when sweeping is complete.I'm waiting for my iRobot Scooba to arrive and see if can really mop my floors. This is cheaper than the $25 dollars per hour the maid services are charging."
2,Just doesn't last,"This vacuum was great in the beginning. It did everything I was told it would do, but 6 months later it quit. I went through the diagnostic test to see what was wrong. It told me, fixed it and worked for another 8 months. Then about a month ago, it was vacuuming my floors and all of a sudden it quit. I thought maybe the batteries were run down so I charged it. It charged, but would not turn on. I bought a new battery pack for $43.00, put it in, charged it and it still won't work. I can't even go through the diagnostic test to see what in the world is wrong because it won't turn on. I paid $149.00 for a Discovery, but I can't afford to spend $149.00 every 1 1/2 years for a new vacuum. When it works, it great, but it sure does break down a lot."
4,I Love the Roomba,"I'm very happy with the Roomba. (We named ours Ralph.) We have 3 cats and a dog, so there's always something hairy on the floor -- it does a great job of general de-fuzzification of the floor. It could do a better job at the edges of the room, by the wall, but really beats doing the vacuuming myself. I like the docking station and the virtual walls and useful. The scheduler isn't as useful in reality as I would have liked. My plan was to have it automatically vacuum every morning, but in reality I need to spend a few minutes getting the room ready before the Roomba runs: picking up the throw rug and cat toys and stray laundry that it would choke on. So a scheduled daily run just doesn't work in my household. But still, my floor gets cleaned more often than when I do the vacuuming myself."
1,Not worth buying it remanufatured,"Since I bought it 2 months ago I realized it wasn't cleaning well and every time we arrived home we founded it dead in a different place. I think the problem is the battery. It works for about 20 minutes than dies!!!! So it is far away from a new one. So we paid half the price of a new one but it works 95% less than a new one ...If you want to buy it try a new one.I even didn't complain, since I'm in Canada. It would cost a lot to send back the battery to them..."
5,Awsome !!!,"This is a must have if you have small kids and pets. We have two small children and 2 cats, one of which is a long haired cat. After running the Roomba just one time I was amazed on how much cat hair the thing picked up. Also is a time saver with the kids and all the other housework, kind of nice not to have to worry about the vacuuumeing just turn the thing on and let it go do it's thing.Highly recremended for anyone with small kids and pets. Although the one cat is affraid of it, it's funny to watch the thing chase them around the house. Any how if your looking for a time saver give this a shot plus when ""Roomba"" starts to get low on battery power it finds its way back to the chargeing base to charge up again for the next run (3 hr quick charge) if you run the battery all the way down which is nice.We love it !!!! Get one for yourself and give it a shot and see what you think, we did...."
1,worked wonderfully - right up until the warranty period ran out!!,i loved this machine. it was an immense help in cleaning kid debris from my hardwoord floors. unfortunately it wasn't WELL refurbished and the darned thing developed multiple glitches two days - to the date - after the warranty wore off.coincidence?now they want another $100 bucks to even look at it. i could have purchased a one new from lnt with the sunday 20% coupon for the price.buyer beware.
3,So So,I have two dogs and it is time consuming to keep the unit clean.It will not accept any weekely commands from the remote.This worked one time and never worked again. You must manually press the clean button to get it to clean. The home base will not stay stationary.It does an acceptable job on FLAT floors.Cliff
5,Works like new ...,"I've had this remanufactured Roomba for several months now. It works well and as advertised. I bought it to supplement an earlier model of the Discovery SE which developed a battery charging problem. Rather than repair the Discovery myself or send it for repairs, I simply use this one to charge all of the APS batteries as well as having several units running simultaneously. It works for me and keeps the older unit going. With it I found that the older APS battery (several years old) was still good. I had bought two new batteries thinking the original SE battery was dead ... then I found info on the defective charging capacitor on the original SE."
4,Roomba Magic!,"I've had my remanufactured roomba scheduler from Amazon for about 2 months now. I LOVE it!It has saved me a lot of time and made me feel like my home is SOOO much cleaner. Before the roomba, I would only vacuum once every week or so. Now I let the roomba go at it every other day in the living room. You would not believe all the dog hair it picks up EVERY time it runs!You do have to spend some time cleaning off the brush bars, etc., underneath, every few times you run it. But it's not much effort and worth all the other time it saves me.I don't use the scheduling feature at all, so I can't comment about that."
1,remanufactured irobot work for four months,Our irobot worked for four months we loved then it stoped working. I bought it a new battery and it work for 20 minutes. Do not buy this it is junk
1,Please Stay Away!,"As you can tell if you read these reviews, the Roomba works great until the day it doesn't. On that day you are completely out of luck with any servicing. Ours quit operating properly shortly after the one year warranty expired. I would expect to pay for shipping and even pay to have my unit serviced. But all Roomba would do is offer to sell me another one. Why would I buy another unit of something that already broke once and that no one on God's green earth can service. It is a complex machine. So about a hundred different things can go wrong. If you are beyond waranty period forget IRobot company helping you. Their phone support is pitiful and their service department does not exist. Any company that wilfully turns happy customers into unhappy customers everyday will soon be out of business."
5,money well spent and Im cheap,"I love my robot NOW. The paperwork say let charge for 3 hrs you need to charge for 24. the first 3-5 times you have to pay attention to where it gets stuck,like under my kitchen chairs, it waistes time trying to get out& the battery dies, Now I move my chairs. it also died out before it found its way back to the charger now its great.It is alittle loud but I set the timer and no cat hair when I come home. Thats what sold me was the reviews of it picking up lots of animal hair.And it does work great I have two monster cats and there was hair everywhere.My friend also bought one a different model she had an issue with it she called customer service they were great sent her out what she needed to fix it and is loving it as much as I am. Thanks"
2,there customer service stinks,I had a problem with my roomba after only two days. I wasn't really too worried about it because it was remanufactured so I thought I might have a problem. I contacted irobot customer service. They diagnosed the problem and told me they would send me out a replacement roomba. After a week went by and no one contacted me with any shipping information I went back to the customer service site to complain. Thy had closed my service ticket. I asked for someone to update the status and this went on for more than a week with no response from them. When I asked them to do something to male this experience a little more palatable for me they wouldn't upgrade the shipping of the replacemnet roomba. The roomba may be great I have no idea but the company behind it doesn't take care of it's customers. I would not recommend purchasing a roomba for that reason.
1,Minimally effective and dies,"Bought a remanufactured Roomba Scheduler 4290 at the end of Dec. It constantly gets hung up on throw rugs and stuck under furniture. Today the charging system decided to give up the ghost. Called tech support and they are sending a ""new"" unit. Good tech support resonse but the unit itself works poorly. In contrast our 535 works great (and is the reason we got the second unit). However, I wouldn't recommend a 4290 to anyone I liked."
2,Roomba Bafoomba,I'm not overly impressed with this vacuum cleaner. I've tried vacuuming a room several times and because of the way the vacuum cleaner is programmed it vacuums the same area of the room over and over again. Also my remote doesn't work so I can program the scheduler.
1,Insufficient shipping packaging may have broken roomba,"I ordered this as a gift for my significant other who likes gadgets. It arrived in a fairly thin bag, around the regular roomba box which had a tear in it and had clearly suffered some abuse either in transit or before shipment. At any rate, it turned out that the bristle guard was broken, and after we got that replaced by the iRobot people, the Roomba still doesn't retain its charge well. I'm guessing since it was refurbished, the Amazon customer service people, who were very prompt in response, were out of stock to send another one (hopefully an operational one) and could only offer a refund if we sent it back, plus a $10 discount on future purchases. Perhaps this was an anomaly, but at this point in time (about 4 weeks after the roomba arrived in the mail), the fact that it does not run properly still has not been resolved."
5,Vroom Vroom Roomba!,"This is a great product that you can trust even if it's remanufactured. Do not go to Ebay to buy this from unknown sellers. Get it from here! Because, when your Roomba is arrived broken Amazon.com will send you a replacement and have UPS pick up your broken Roomba from your doorstep where Roomba was delivered. Roomba is otherwise still fully functionaly self navigating robot. Most of the time, small plastic that holds the brush unit breaks during transit. I would suggest the manufacturer to change it to metal or stronger plastic. Until then, it's going to break during Transit. While it wasn't vacuuming, I let the motor run on battery and it was amazing to watch it work. It went under the bed and couch. When it worked for only once when I taped the plastic together, it really does gather all the settled dust bunnies from under the bed. I totally considering getting rid of my upright 12 Amp Bissel."
3,Close but no cigar,"I'm kinda dissapointed in this because so many people have raved about theirs.My biggest gripe is the cleaning quality. It's not nearly as good as a real vacuum cleaner. I'd say it does about the same as a powered floor sweeper, but it's not a vacuum.I suppose it will be good to keep the carpet free of visible debris between thorough cleanings with my upright vacuum, but I was hoping for a real hands free no worry vacuum replacement- this isn't it.Also, it gets hung up on small obstacles like the base to a floor fan I have, and it has problems docking properly- it got stuck sideways trying to dock with it's base twice now. Lastly, it's louder than I thought. It sounds like one of those remote control toy cars- non stop for an hour."
1,Stopped working after 1 week,I bought this remanufactured roomba from amazon. After one week it stopped working. It basically starts going back and forth in one square foot of area and not going anywhere. It's returned.
4,"Ethyl, my new friend!","I was introduced to Ethyl (my Roomba) on my birthday. She was introduced to me by my husband. I have MS therefore vacuuming has become a difficult, exhausting chore so my husband brought Ethyl into my life and I am very happy with her! I only need to empty the receptacle and clean the hair off the roller (we have a Chow dog) a few times during her vacuuming cycle. I no longer dread this chore and would recommend Roomba to all!"
4,Cleans Well,"Don't get rid of your vacuum just yet, but as an in between vacuuming aid this vacuum is great. It wonderfully gets under chairs and the sofa and gets the pet hair and dust bunnies we all joke about.Just remember it takes quite a while to vacuum a room."
3,Light duty only - not a replacement for a vacuum,"I purchased a remanufactured one and it worked fine each time. I did at one point have to send it in for repair because of the battery. My recommendation is to drain the battery each time; constant recharging will shorten the battery life. I liked it for under the bed and cabinet locations because my vacuum was harder to use. It worked well to pick up additional dirt and hair after I vacuumed or in hard to reach areas. However, it just didn't do it for me when I got a dog. I found that I had to keep emptying out the tray more often than I would like. At that point, I was just better off vacuuming. I also agree with other reviewers, you can't leave it alone. Sometimes it gets suck under the dishwasher or around the sofa.If you need your house to be spotless every day or you have a small apt/house, then it might work for you. If you have kids or dogs/cats, better off with a vacuum. I ended up getting a better vacuum and haven't used the Roomba since."
1,Title,"This product was awful and a waste of my time, effort, and excitment. It only worked for about 5 or 6 minutes the first couple times I used it, then stopped working all together. iRobot was very difficult to work with."
4,Works great,"I love my Roomba. Even though it was refurbished, it works wonderfully. Hard wood floors are a nightmare when it comes to hair and dust buildup. I used to have to sweep at least twice a week. Not anymore. However, I must say that it is much better for floors than for carpeting. I still have to vacuum. But I am satisfied b/c most of my home has flooring. My only complaint is it has trouble climbing from the floor onto my rugs. I usually have to prod it along."
3,Definatly NOT a vacuum!,"We got one because of the great reviews. I was surprised to find that it really isn't a vacuum. It's a sweeper. It has no suction at all, so i'm not sure why they call it a vacuum. As a sweeper on low carpet, hardwood and tiles it does an ok job. Don't expect this thing to get anything deep in your carpet. If you have pets and carpet you will spend a lot of time detangling the hair on the bristle brush that sweeps the debree into the chamber. That's my oppinion, take it for what it's worth."
4,"Solid, if amateurish, debut","Shadows Fall debuted with this album, a slice of aggressive, although diverse metalcore. Boston, MA has emerged as a sort of capital for metalcore bands in recent years, and this band played a significant part in the burgeoning scene. With that aside, I feel that Somber Eyes To The Sky stands as the band's greatest musical statement, despite an apparent number of flaws.Due to lousy production, the songs suffer during the transitions from acoustic breaks to pummeling riff assaults, much like in the second track ""Pure"". I noticed that the drummer falls behind during more of the technically demanding parts, but on a debut album this can be overlooked. The layered vocals and graceful guitar harmonies deserve praise, and the band never steps into self-indulgent territories. Although the second half of the album isn't as strong as the first, I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys hardcore, metalcore, or ""Gothenburg"" tinged metal."
2,greater things to come,"This cd is so bad its not funny...sure if you like bad metal all mushed together thats sounds like static than this is the album to get. Avoid Of One Blood too....they almost have their ground on that album but once again the songs are boring and sound like every other death metal band, I will admit Crushing Belial is a good song. Now The Art of Balance...thats a good cd! Their masterpiece!"
4,"An unsung Masterwork of ""cinema verite""","Very few people took notice of Wanda on it's release--the critics found it depressing and ""undramatic"", its visual style amateurish, its plot hardly formed. What a difference a few decades can make. Now the film stands very tall with the best of the ""cimema verite"" style--it's tone echoes both the Dardenne Brothers films and the harsh world of Gaspar Noe, as well as the best of independent film making. It is a film very ahead of its time--prophetic in so many ways. The heroine is an utter failure with little future-but this film, with its muted colors, marvelous sense of place, and steady devotion to harsh truths makes it one of the strongest works of art to emerge from the 60's. It's a revelation for anyone devoted to great cinema."
4,El Condor,"Vintage Lee Van Cleef and Jim Browm acted out their parts well. I always like these type of Westerns, they never date, but then I grew up on them. The stories always have the same theme but, coupled to the acting and stunning western scenery, they always capture me.Having been fortunate enough to visit the scenery in Spain at ""Cinema Studios Fort Bravo"", (""Texas Hollywood"") in the Desert of Tabernas, Almeria Spain (the only desert in Europe), and Andalucía, Spain doubling for the US in Arizona, New Mexico and California, the films give me added pleasure. Hope they go on remaking them so as to benefit from the new technology.I enjoyed this film which I saw on television, but I did see it originally at the cinema long before DVD's or Videos were in existence."
4,El Condor DVD,The DVD arrived in great condition and when I was told it would arrive. I shop at Amazon.com a lot and have never been disappointed with any product I have purchased.
1,Don't Bother,"I have been playing off of tablature for 15 years. I can't speak for the whole book because I put it down after realizing that Behind Blue Eyes, and Dreaming From the Waist, are completely wrong for both chords and timing. I hope someone else does a better job for The Who in the future."
5,Essential reading for the chess player,This small book is essential reading for any chess player. Reti's understanding of the game and his ability to explain the concepts of it are unsurpassed. There's nothing else I can say. Get it.
2,Needs to be sent through one more round of editing,"Overall the premise of the book to use examples to teach is good, and the examples themselves were well chosen. However, the devil is in the details. There were numerous unexplained forward references, some incorrect information (its explanation of whether Applescript is reentrant comes to mind) and the example scripts included on the CD were buggy. It took all of one click (chaning the year) to crash the Date Minder script which they claim met their high standards. All in all because of these problems I wouldn't recommend this book, although there really isn't much in the way of competition.J Schmitz"
3,Requires some programming experience,"I found the book to be very useful for most of the book. Howvever, I found that the book did not emphasize enough on what were actual commands and what was data. Somtimes the syntax was a little misleading because of the way the examples were written. You will have to read the examples a couple of times to figure out what is applescript commands and what isn't. I was looking for a book that showed how each command was used and then how to put them all together. Most C and BASIC books are written like this."
5,Nice pictures and entertaining for young children.,"This book is good to read to young children to teach them about self esteem and how to love various aspects of themselves. After reading the book, have the child talk about things that they like about themselves. It's a good way for children to start loving themselves."
4,not bad..,"Status Quo is, undoubtedly one of the most important rock bands of seventies and eighties. And they are still making music. This album contains most of their best songs. Album quality is pretty high. Unfortunately, it doesn't contain some hits, like ""In The Army Now""."
1,disgusting,"This book is nothing short of child abuse. It's an insult to a Christ of love, and anyone who seeks justice for those the church has marginalized and misrepresented."
2,five mile creek 20,we got this video and it was a bad quality. we tried to get it replaced but didn't get any response from the seller after several tries. we will not knowingly buy from this seller again.
1,Corrupted my camera's XD card,"When I used this to connect a 1GB XD card to my MacBook Pro, I got a host of error messages. What I did not get was the six weeks worth of pictures that used to be on the card. Nor will I be getting them: the reader corrupted the card, requiring a complete reformat and the consequent loss of a month and a half of baby pictures. Thanks, Dane-Elec!Look elsewhere for a card reader. You can get a good cheap one that won't wipe your data. I sure wish I had."
5,"fast, reliable, works on Win & Linux, cheap","I bought this card at a military PX while on vacation. I didn't recognize the brand but it was the only thing they had, so I tried it. Pleasant surprise. It was cheap (about $20), the fastest I have ever used at 20-30 MB/sec depending on the card & computer, works on Ubuntu Linux and Win XP, and I've used SD cards, micro SD with an adapter, and CF cards all no problem."
1,Really 9 in 1. Deceptive description..,"Product description is deceptive. Reader is not 15 in 1, it is 9 in 1. It will not read microSD, miniSD CardRS-MMC, MMCmobile, Memory Stick Duo, or Memory Stick Duo Pro cards without an adapter that is not included.I requested that Amazon up date the description. Even on the packaging the need for an adapter is printed in very small type that requires a magnifying glass to read."
5,It works well. I am very pleased.,"This reader works very well. I like the fact that it is very small and takes no room to store in laptop cases, camera cases, etc. Mine has done alot of traveling and is very durable. It is not unusual for me to download as many as 800-1000 pictures at once and it goes very quickly. The best part is I only paid about $4 for it when I got it."
3,Crack Disc,My last disc of rosemary and thyme is crack and i was wondering how I can just get that last disc?
1,confusing information,"I will adjust my rating if I order, I love the series. The confusion is the reviews state its 22 episodes totaling 18 hours of viewing but the product description states 7 disc totaling 308 minutes equaling a little more than 5 hrs of viewing. I cannot make the math work, can anyone help me with this as I would really like to order this wonderful collection. Is it the complete 2003 season or the complete series from 2003 to 2006? Thank you, Dennis"
5,Great shows,Love the interaction between Rosemary & Thyme. There's noviolence and the scenery is beautiful. Great to watch on a coldevening. Wish they still were making more.

5,Love this show!,"If you love Columbo, You'll love Rosemary & Thyme. It a great murder mystery series with just enought personal side stories. The humor is great and the gardens are absolutely gorgeous. Just wish there were more episodes. But I'll be watch in these over and over and over again!"
5,Hurray CC included,"I am so happy. I love this series and they have finally included CC!! The gardens are gorgeous and the characters are lovable. The situations are not believable and the dialogue a little weak, but it is a good series to just sit back and relax."
5,love this show,"i like most of the british mystery series - but this one is just so good. it has the gorgeous gardens,but it doesn't matter whether you like gardens or not. it's the two women - they are just a great combination and their friendship and the light comedy along with the mystery solving all go together to make a great show. there are some series that i bought when the price came down, or others i just rented from the library. but this series i bought every time the newest one came out on dvd. i knew we would want to watch them over and over."
2,Wanted more mystery,Love the theme music and the scenery but rated 2 stars for just OK - would loved to have more of a mystery.

2,Despicable heroine.,"I've never""met""a more despicable heroine than Beatrice Lacey. It wasn't a page turner for me - it was a stomach turner. I only finished reading it to find out if she got her ""comeuppance""."
3,"Please shut up, Beatrice","The aspects of this book that bothered other people so much weren't the reason I disliked it. Incest? Have at it, kids. Evil, unsympathetic heroine? Well, at least I liked the ending more for it. No, the thing that bothered me was the fact the author does not shut up about how wonderful and beautiful and mind-blowingly intelligent Beatrice is. This is more obnoxious considering the story is in first person and often we will get page long descriptions of Beatrice talking about how beautiful she, how she looks like a goddess, etc etc etc. Or how no man she meets can resist hopping into bed with her. Or how she's such a genius and she's just that great. In first person.It gets boring."
1,Made me sick,This book made me sick! I wish I would have ready the commentary about the incest before I bought the book. I thought the incest portion would just be a small part and then move on. When it kept going I couldn't handle it a moment longer. I peaked into the back of the book and saw that there was no end to it. I threw the book into the recycling bin because I did not want to pass this trash on!
2,Filthy,"This is the first book I have read in a while that I just didn't like and really didn't want to finish AND would never recommend. I can't say I hated it because it did make me hope for the redemption of the main character and I could understand her love of the land. However, the main character is everything you wouldn't want to be and will stop at nothing to get what she wants. I just couldn't stomach a lot of what happened; it was too much. She commits about every sin you can think of (and beyond). It was like reading into every dirty, twisted thought in the authors imagination that no one else would dare put on paper. So if you are interested in that kind of reading you'll probably love it---but not me!"
2,The Most Disgusting Character Ever,"I actually read this entire book just to see if/how Beatrice would get what was coming to her. Yes, the book is about incest. The ads and cover I've seen for this book state something like ""Murder, Incest, Betrayal"" or something like that so it should come as no shock that it is about incest. The thing I didn't like was that about 2/3 of the book seemed to be about nothing but sex. Sex scene after sex scene. I frankly belive it's better to leave it to the imagination. We all know what happens when you have sex. But really it seemed more wrong that Beatrice and her brother acted like a couple in love. It wasn't just the incest that was gross. Gregory's descriptions of other physical things left me queasy at times. After everything, I think what Beatrice did to her husband had to be one of the vilest acts I've ever read. This book was at the most okay and I do not recommend it."
1,This is pure trash,"I have enjoyed two of this author's books, and thought this would be of similar quality. It drags on and on; the story is almost laughable in its ridiculous sordidness. I almost always finish a book once I pick it up -- the only book I have stopped reading because it was so bad was 'The Last Confederate's Widow'. This truly awful book was the second."
3,"Wideacre - Hardly Wide, and Certainly Not Deep","I, like many other fans of Phillipa Gregory, chose to read this book after a very enjoyable experience with ""The Other Boleyn Girl."" The book starts out strong, but lags and slows in the middle, delaying the inevitable, predictable ending for about 200 pages or so. The main characters are hardly likeable, and the characters that are likeable aren't main characters. Some folks have compared Beatrice to Scarlett of ""Gone With the Wind,"" but even Scarlett had a line she wouldn't cross. Beatrice stops at absolutely nothing to gain control of what she wants, and honestly, it isn't very realistic at all. It wasn't the worst, but I wouldn't urge others to waste their time on it."
1,Didn't bother finishing this one,"I enjoyed Phillipa Gregory's other novels. So, I was quite disappointed with this one. The main character is simply detestable, but not in a way that kept me reading further than the incestuous lust. Yuck, no thanks."
3,Oh Please Beatrice!,"THis is a good novel...if you like loads of detail and an over dramatic heroine. As soon as Ralph left the story really lost a lot of it's center and things definitely spin out of control. Beatrice is an unbelievable waste, and it's hard to belive that anyone can catch that much detail in first person point of view. But For some reason I continued to read and finished some what satisfied because towards the end Beatrice was right Her Ralph Belong together and if anything they made the story worth reading."
2,disappointed,"I had read the whole series of books written by Gregory on the court of Henry the VIII and I loved them. I felt like I was really learning about history at the same time that I was reading an interesting story with a bit of romance/intrigue, etc. I thought that the Wideacre series might be more of the same. Instead, this book simply reads more like a torrid romance novel set in the past."
1,Incestuous filth,"Unfortunately I bought the trilogy after reading The Other Boleyn Girl thinking that all of this authors works would be good. I was wrong. I read this book and the start of the next, The Favored Child, and it is all disgusting. Honestly, I don't know who would enjoy this kind of rag."
2,portrait of a sociopath,"The book is fascinating in the fact that it is a study of a woman with antisocial personality disorder (the traditional psychopath or sociopath). She is also extremely narcisstic.The fascination with her lessens as she progresses in her mental illness. She plays the dominatrix with her brother and makes all the people around her suffer. She is responsible for many deaths in her short life. The amount of suffering she caused was disturbing to this reader. I disliked her so much!Soon her psychopathology became more that I could bear to continue reading. I only finished the book because of the other characters. I wanted to see what would happen to them.The details of farming and the class systems were interesting to read, but I do not recommend the book for lovers of historical fiction with strong women characters. Beatrice Lacey has been compared to Scarlett O'Hara in some reviews I have read. Scarlet had many redeeming qualities, and Beatrice has absolutely none."
1,Tiresome,"I have nothing against antiheros or evil characters, but I absolutely hated this book. In Beatrice Lacey, Philippa Gregory gives us an utterly unlikable heroine, one completely lacking in redeeming values. As a result, the book becomes a depressing slog through one predictable mess after another. Every time Beatrice is presented with two possible courses of action -- one that will spare herself and others pain, and one that will cause more pain and loss, she chooses evil, even when the kinder choice would also be better for her, practically speaking. After a while, this gets terribly boring -- the reader doesn't know exactly what horrible situation will arise next, but he or she can rest assured that Beatrice will make the worst of it. Frankly, a character this one-dimensional is just no fun. I found myself wishing her ex-lover would just come back and kill her already so the book could end (I'm not giving anything away here. It's clear almost from the outset how things will end)."
5,My favorite P. Gregory,"This is my absolute favorite Philippa Gregory book. I first read it probably 8 years ago, and I read the trilogy again every couple of years. It's clever and gripping. Even remembering the general plot, I still am transfixed by Beatrice Lacey and her wicked ways."
4,Twisted but addicting,"To be honest, this did not seem like any of the typical genres I enjoy. In fact, I bought this book at a flea market on a whim & delayed starting it because I doubted I would like it. I was wrong, within a few (very LONG) chapters I was hooked. This book is so morally wrong but I couldn't put it down. Definitely not for the feint of heart but it was riveting and I'm excited to start the second one. I can only imagine how disturbing the next one will be."
1,Incest!,I've purchased and enjoyed several Phillipa Gregory novels and was very dissapointed to read a about an incestual relationship between a brother and sister as if it was a romance. Very dissapointing. Would not recommend it to anyone.
2,Gregory can do better,"I enjoyed ""The Other Boleyn Girl "" and ""The Queens Fool"" tremendously. Foool that I am myself, I enthusiastically ordered all three Wideacre novels. What a disappointment. If you are looking for the same delightful period historic drama you will not find them in the ""Wideacre"" trilogy. Here is the romantic drama at it's lowest - incest, spicy sex and Fate without the merit of the honest, interesting characters Gregory learned to build later. The writing is unripe and the story sour. I AM looking forward to reading ""The Virgin's Lover"", hoping, with some trepidation, to discover again the mature Gregory I enjoyed."
1,Couldn't get past the incest of this book - made me sick,"I enjoyed the first act of this book, but just couldn't believe, and then couldn't continue with one of the main plot lines of this novel which involved the continual discussion of overpowering lust between brother & sister. Call me old fashioned...."
1,Disgusting,I absolutely hate this book! The incest is so disgusting - and the auther tries to make is appear normal and sexy - I got the stomach flu after starting this book - it was probably the book that caused it! I threw it away and did not finish it! Very dissappointing!!!
1,What a shame...,"...that Ms. Gregory felt she had to resort to the crude and vulgar story lines in this series. Yes, I read all three. They came in a set and I was hoping the other two books would explain whys and wherefores of the first book, perhaps to redeem the characters and justify their actions. They didn't. The plot and characters just got worse and worse. And like a car wreck, I couldn't help but look.As many have said, there are no redeeming qualities in any of the main characters. I hoped for Beatrice to have a change of heart which never occurred. She makes Scarlett O'Hara look like Mother Teresa.I, too, really enjoyed the Tudor series and was wanting more. Unfortunately, this series doesn't even come close.While I didn't go as far as to shred the books, I put them in my ""things for the garage sale"" box. Maybe I'll get a few of my wasted dollars back."
1,Quite possibly the worst book I have ever read,"I very much enjoyed some of the author's other books. Even keeping in mind that this was her first novel, it is thoroughly sub-par. The character are unbelievable, the situations are unlikey and the justifications for the actions of the characters are badly conceived.Skip this and go straight to the author's books on the Tudor women, don't waste your time with this mess."
3,Like watching a train wreck,"I couldn't put this book down.The characters (esp. Beatrice, though Harry is a very close 2nd) are horribe, amoral, disgusting people and yet I just could not stop reading it. Just when you think it can't get any worse it does!It's quite possibly one of the most shocking books I;ve ever read."
5,More than what you pay for,"The first book I ever read by Philippa Gregory was ""The Other Boleyn Girl"". I fell in love with her writing style and thought I would find similar structure in ""Wideacre"".I was wrong.This book goes above and beyond anything else I've read in the historical fiction genre. Beatrice isn't a damsel in distress nor is she some ninny like Scarlet O'Hara who is more worried about gossip than her own ideas. No, far from it. This young woman knows exactly what she wants and will go to any lengths in order to obtain said goals. Even if it means sacrificing her body, heart, and mind in the process.I'm usually just a library reader and I rarely order things offline. I loved this book so much that I caved without a second thought."
1,Absolutely horrible!,"I could not even finish the book because of how disturbing, as well as unrealistic, the plot was. It was a complete waste of money. This was my first time reading Philippa Gregory and though I still think I am going to give her other works a chance, do not waste your money on this one. If you do feel compelled to read it, check the book out from your library; at least this way it won't cost you anything when you are disappointed."
4,"Great Book. Please readers, this is early Gregory. Not a carbon copy of The Other Boleyn Girl by any means.","I was looking at Ms. Gregory's backlis today to see which books I had overlooked. I personally loved the Wideacre trilogy. I just finished The Other Boleyn Girl and while it is good, it is a more commercial, fluffy book than some of her previous work.It seems as though a lot of people latched on to The Other Boleyn Girl and expect her previous works to be exactly the same. Wideacre involves intrigue, incest, scandal and a lot of deception. If you like your stories light, this book is probably not for you.Please don't blame Ms. Gregory for writing more in-depth books prior to the recent commercially successful books.Anyhow, this trilogy is amazingly written. I won't bog you down with the synopsis but highly recommend it. Also the Wise Woman is another good read too. For fans of Elizabeth Chadwick, I think you will enjoy Ms. Gregory's earlier works."
4,Excellent writing fails to motivate reader to finish book,"I rated this book four stars only because the writing is so excellent. I could not finsh this book however, merely because I was so sick of how vain this Beatrice was. You can only stand to read ""I was so lovely"" or ""I was as lovely as a sleek pampered cat"" so many times before I wanted to throw the book down in disgust.Also, if there would have been any way of sympathizing with the character, I would have finished, but I read about 300 pages and couldn't take it anymore. Not only endlessly vain but totally psycotic! Read The Queens Fool instead."
4,Incestual Yet Fascinating,"I love Gregory's books, however the ""Wideacre"" series is slightly odd. I might be biased in my opinion because I adore Gregory's other books ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" and ""The Queen's Fool"" and had I read ""Wideacre"" before falling in love with those other novels, I think my opinion would be quite different. ""Wideacre"" is wonderfully written with an easy reading flow and an addictive story, yet some aspects might be rather condradictive to most morals and values. I find the idea of a character that seduces her brother into having 2 children with her (which strangely enough seem to surpass all rules of incest and are born without birth defects) quite disturbing. I think it is a wonderful story about a woman's struggle in 18th century England to claim land and titles through her own cunning. It is pleasantly wicked yet disturbing. Beatrice is truley unlike any character you will ever run across."
3,"""Shocking"" yet surprisingly dull","While sharing many themes with ""The Other Boleyn Girl,"" a book I thoroughly enjoyed, ""Wideacre"" lacks the sweep of historical events to pull it along. It strands its all-powerful heroine and her weak and dependents on the title estate and repeats the same cycle--a manipulative act, a crisis that risks exposure, a quick-thinking cover-up--over and over as the novel ploughs through 500 pages to its inevitable conclusion. Worse, she removes the heroine's only real adversary early in the action and doesn't bring him back until the bitter end. For a novel set in an era when conversation and language were so important, there is surprisingly little dialogue; Ms. Gregory fills the pages instead with repetitious, purple passages about the Power of the Land and the heroine's indestructible loveliness. I look forward to reading her other books, but will skip the sequels as they promise more of the same."
1,UGGG!,I hated this book! It is such a disappointing series after reading The Other Bolyn Girl which I absolutely loved. This series is centered around a incest - which is detailed graphically in the book(s). Very disappointing.
1,Uck,"At first I was entertained at how absolutely out of control this book was. Then it started giving me anxiety attacks.I didn't finish it.But, I'll give credit where credit is due. To elicit such a strong emotional response...even a negative one, takes good writing.I just couldn't handle the stress anymore."
1,"If I could use less than 1 star, I would!","If incest is your thing, then this book is for you. After reading the other reviews, I decided to find this book and see what it was about. I only read about 100 pages and decided this was probably the worst read ever. I am disgusted by the time spent in forcing myself to read this garbage. I fail to see where incest plays a role in romance. I will admit that I can't write a review on the entire book because I couldn't past the incest. Maybe the book had more redeeming qualities towards the end, but I doubt it."
2,Eeeeewwwww!,"I kept wondering for a while where this story was gonna go.It had the makings of greatness. But I guess the author wanted to keep predictability to a minimum---I assumed it would be something of a ROMANCE! Hello!? I read ahead when I got tired of messing around with the stable boy or whatever----I am sorry, but I am not interested in a book on INCEST. That is disgusting.I just don't want to do that. Especially as engrossing an aspect as sleeping with your brother for 600 pages. Yuck.The beginning bones of the story were good. The rest of the tragedy was great. But incest I just can't take. Another person, have at it. For the most part, it was well written in a Scarlett-O'Hara-ish way. That part was good. Can't tell ya anything else.Oh, and if you're interests incline towards Historical British families and incest, read ""Angels and Insects."" Just as yucky."
2,Disturbing but unbelievable novel!,"I started this book awhile ago, but stopped because i was revolted by the incest. Recently i decided to give the book another try, and this time finished it! Although the book is very disturbing, it is one of the most riveting and haunting books i've ever read. I am literally still thinking about it weeks later, its that powerful. I think the thing that sets this book apart from others the way you get inside Beatrice's head. Its amazing how she makes her despicable actions seem resonable, so although you want to hate her, somehow you just cant! This is a very worthwhile read, but not for the faint of heart..."
1,Ugh - one of the worst books I've read!,"I am a high school English teacher, and about as open-minded about literature as they come. That said, I absolutely was repulsed by this book and actually threw it away. I certainly would never recommend it to anyone, and it's not anything I would read again. Some may argue that the author's goal was to make you dislike Beatrice, therefore the book is a success, blah blah blah...but there is really nothing redeeming about her, no lesson to be learned here, and I found the incest in it to be stomach-turning."
2,Don't bother...Worse than a soap opera.,"Wideacre went on and on and on and on and on and on, same blather on and on. Could have been an interesting story (hence the ""2"" stars instead of the ""1"" I was tempted to give it) if the author had not felt the reader wouldn't catch on to the theme unless she hit us over the head with it a million times. Had to fill those hundreds and hundreds of pages, I guess. I ended up skipping whole chapters I was so tired of Beatrice and Wideacre, and still knew what had happened and what was going to happen; the author was so hamfisted with the ""suspense"". I regret to say I have all 3 of the trilogy, not sure I'll ever pick up the other 2 as this one has been such a monumental waste of time. It left me feeling cheated (out of my money) and sorry (that I had read it)."
1,Must I give even one star?,"Where to begin. This is a horrid book - it's the sort that takes several doses of Austen to get over the nightmarish awfulness of it. Incest. Patricide. Matricide too, of course. Adultery - lots of it. S&M - pages of stomach turning episodes. Children born of incest - twice. Every moral character suffers and is tormented by the 'heroine' and her lovers. Really, not what I expected. For those who don't want to delve into the darker side of Philippa Gregory, be advised that this is a really rough read, with no redeeming qualities at all. I couldn't finish it."
4,Philippa Gregory books take me back in time like no other author can.,"Could someone check and see if Gregory was actually born within the last century because I am convinced she is a time traveler from Georgian England. Her easy to read and fluid writing has helped me develop what I think will be a lifelong interest in English history. My previous interest in England never went beyond the Beatles and the mod era of the 1960's, but Gregory's user friendly writing style takes the reader back in time.Although some of this book's content might be considered distasteful I found much of it educational, especially in terms of how women were judged as baby makers and producers of male heirs.Barreness was considered a true stigma for a women as if the guy had nothing to do with it. Gregory helps me feel connected to history.I found this book more intriguing and suspensful than many books with modern characters. By the way is Philippa Gregory also Victoria Holt?"
2,Main Character Too Awful to Get Over,"I don't often review historical fiction, but I am a fan of Philippa Gregory's other books. I think she is a decent writer, and has brought many historical characters to life. But like many others reviewers here, I really despised this book, and almost didn't make it through. I kept plowing along, hoping beyond hope that some redeeming feature would surface in Beatrice, but it never did. And I didn't feel that her background and love of Wideacre sufficiently explained the awfulness of her deeds, so I was just left feeling like I was reading the biography of a sociopath. Which is not much fun. Maybe if the book had been positioned as that, I would have felt differently about it.So I am firmly in the camp with those reviewers that felt Beatrice was just too disgusting and awful to devote an entire book too, and that the elegant book structure and prose didn't make up for it."
2,Wideacre by Phillippa Gregory,"Having read several of Philippa Gregory' s historical novels about the Tudors, I had expected something better written. The storyline was at the same time unbelievable and predictable with huge contradictions in character portrayal . I had been hoping for a good period novel, but that is not what Wideacre isl"
2,too dark,Readers should know that this story is not a typical romance. It is about incest and is too dark and salacious for me. I deleted it from my kindle.
1,This is one sick book,"Incest, murder, greed, deceit: this book has it in abundance. The ""heroine"" of the novel is one sick, twisted woman. I read the entire book, hoping she would redeem herself, but it was terrible to the very last. I kept hoping the incestuous relationship with her brother would end, but even after she married she kept it up to control him. This book is a waste of paper."
1,Hard Book to Finish,"I had a hard time finishing this book! The beginning is extremely Borring.... The middle is Outrageous full of secrets, incest, violence, & unbeliable! The end is Predictable & again borring! the author could have spiced up the end, I knew what was going to happen, it was a waist to read it! I have read many of Philippa Gregory's books and have loved them, but this one I just did not grasp! It was twisted, reminds me of VC Andrews' Stories!I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK....Usually I fly through books... but this one took me a long time to read , it dragged on with meaningless details!"
1,I Think The Author Read Too Many Romance Novels,I read the Wildacre trilogy and was very disturbed by the sexual content and discriptions. You NEVER see this in other books depicting this era - except in trashy romance novels. If you want to read classy historical novels try Taylor Caldwell.
1,Wideacre not in line with other Gregory novels,Wideacre : A NovelThis novel was very disappointing. It was a depressing read based on the characters' incest and disgusting values.
3,Weird-acre?,"This was a very weird book. I had read Gregory's Tudor-themed books and enjoyed them very much, so I looked forward to starting the Wideacre trilogy. There is a lot of twisted sex in this book; it's hard to like ANY of the characters. I've started ""The Favored Child"" and it promises to be just as odd--but I've come too far not to find out what happens to the Lacey clan!"
3,"Too awful to read, but I couldn't stop myself!","Oh it is just so gruesome the various ways Beatrice betrays her charge to take care of Wideacre. Sometimes my stomach would turn from the horrible things she did. I thought I just couldn't read it anymore... she was unintentionally, but most certainly, destroying that which she loved so much: Wideacre. It just upset me too much.Yet, before I knew it, I was back again, eagerly reading on and on. I had to know what happened next! It's terrible and wonderful at the same time. I liked it enough to read all three of the Wideacre series, even though I had to put up with the anxiety!"
1,don't judge a book by its cover!,"I picked up this book expecting a nice, enjoyable historical fiction- what a dissapointment! If I had such a depraved mind I would certainly not advertise it. This book is certainly not one to keep around if you have young children who are readers."
3,Don't put these images into your mind,"I've thoroughly enjoyed several of Gregory's other novels, so I had high hopes for this book. Honestly, though, I wish I didn't have images from this story lingering in my mind, because the plot and protagonist are simply too vile for words. I bought it as an airplane read, and I did finish it (trapped in the big tin can in the sky), but I threw it away in disgust as I left the airport because I didn't want it in my home. I find myself a bit sick to my stomach thinking about it again, although I read it months ago. Stick with the wonderful Boleyn series, and leave this one alone!"
3,"Well written, poorly executed","The author's writing style is near flawless. With great imagery and poetic description, one feels drawn into the land. Unfortunately, the character of Beatrice leaves much to be desired. She's an anti-heroine through and through. She knows what she wants (Wideacre) and she'll resort to any means necessary to keep it. As a regular person, she's hard to related to and you find yourself so drawn into her lies and manipulative actions, that you become frustrated with the character and the situations.Yes, there is incest in the book. It's pretty needless and this is one of the reasons why I will not read the other novels in this trilogy. Another reason is because of Beatrice's deeds, I lost a sense of connection with the Laceys. The only comfort found in this novel is from the secondary characters, who also become twisted by Beatrice. I found the conclusion of the story satisfying."
2,A heroine to thoroughly dislike....,"As with all Phillipa Gregory novels, Wideacre is beautifully written and rich with details of the period, especially about how estates really worked, and as such, I'd like to recommend it. But the trouble is that the central character, Beatrice, is so thoroughly unsympathetic and so many of the events of the book are so vile that it's hard to view the book with anything but distaste. On top of everything else, most of the characters are pretty sketchy... Beatrice has one motivation only, and nothing that much makes you care about her plight, and nearly everyone else is a stick figure for her to play with. There are many wonderful books by this author; this, unfortunately, isn't one of them."
1,Unreadable,Disgusting tripe-certainly not the caliber of Anne Bolyn. I will think again before purchasing another book by Philippa Gregory.
3,Definately not my favorite Philippa Gregory,"The Other Boleyn Girl was my first read by Philippa Gregory. I absolutely loved it and quickly picked up The Queens Fool, which I enjoyed even more. Wideacre started well, but Beatrice developed into such an unlikeable character that my enjoyment waned. I did soldier on, reading the rest of the trilogy, but thought The Favoured Child was the same story, retold with different characters. And I just grew frustrated with Julia and her wimpiness. Meridon was definately better- at least it was somewhat different- but by then the amount of incest (and I am by no stretch a prude) started to get to me. I know it's all fiction, but the fact that Meridon was so healthy considering her geneology was just ridiculous. As much as I enjoy Gregory's writing, the selfishness of some of her characters is just amazing- and creates some very unlikable characters."
1,The most ridiculous tripe I've ever read.,"I don't know which is more ludicrous: the main character maiming her lover in a man-trap, the main character's incestuous sado-masochistic relationship with her brother, her legless lover returning to do her in at the end, or the fact that I read this book all the way through. This was an airport buy, and I've never made a more sorry reading choice in my life; I spent ten hours on a flight from the U.S. to the U.K. wincing as I turned every punishing page. I've enjoyed other books by Ms. Gregory, but I certainly won't be finishing this trilogy."
1,Don't bother,I seldom pay full price for a book but I was desperate. Big mistake! Looks like this author's best work is behind her and she's just trying to cash in our her name now.
1,Disturbed,"I picked up this book because I had adored The Queens Fool by Gregory. The Queen's Fool is fantastic. On the other hand, I couldn't finish Wideacre. I was too disturbed by Wideacre's irritating main characters. The deviance, murder, obesession, and incest is upsetting and unneccesary. It is not presented in a manner that makes it interesting, only disturbing. If I had not read the other book first, I would have thought her a smut novelist."
1,Awful,"This book was so awful, I threw it away after reading the first few chapters. I highly recommend that you give it a pass."
1,Gothic Novel starring a sociopath,"I too am contemplating what to do this book when I am done. Usually, when I finish a book I tell everyone about it and lend it out. This book is another case altogether. The immorality in the book offends me but also makes it hard to put down. I keep ploughing through thinking that Beatrice can't possibly do anything worse than she's already done...but she does. I especially feel awful for the John McAndrew character. She does make me think of Scarlett O'Hara but Scarlett was a much nicer personality than Beatrice. Gregory seems to be writing about a sociopath rather than a normal human being. I would not recommend this book or this author again. I am very disappointed."
1,Couldn't get through it,"I have read other books by Phillipa Gregory, which I loved. This book however, I couldn't finish. I found it terribly disturbing and even depressing. There was never any attachment to the characters and with every turn it seemed to get more and more ridiculous. I am glad to see that the author has greatly improved with her more recent books."
2,"not great, but ok","This book would be great if the main charater,Beatrice, wasn't so annoying, selfish and all-around crazy. I mean don't get me wrong, Philippa Gregory is a great author and I like all of her other books that she's written but Beatrice is just so evil. I mean who would destroy her reputation, murder(more then one person), and destroy a whole peice of land just to save it?? I don't expect every heroine to be like Jane Eyre, but I don't think that Beatrice even deserves the title of ""heroine"".Now, the other charaters are great, the story line is good, the setting is perfect, but I just wanted to throw the book across the room whenever Beatrice came on the page. It gives me shivers to think about what she did to her people and land. I'm sorry if I sound really negitive, but even though I liked the book I really didn't like the main charater and that's never good."
1,TOO SORDID AND UNREALISTIC TO BE ENJOYABLE READING,"""Wideacre""'s theme of incest and sexual perversion totally repulsed and sickened me. It's just too sordid and disgusting for words, and I found reading it, disturbing and unsettling. Not to mention, an unrealistic plot. Too sick and grotesque for words.Don't waste your money.I had high expectations for this book because I had so thoroughly enjoyed Philippa Gregory's other books. However, I will think twice before buying anything else by this author."
1,ugh... not much else to say,"I read this book several years ago and I was flabbergasted. I don't have a problem with sexuality in literature, but incest is another story especially when it is used in this way. To me it did not seem to be painted in a negative manner. It was like you should feel proud of Beatrice for using any means necessary to keep her land. I literally felt ill after reading this. It's disgusting and I agree with some of the other reviews that you just can't feel empathy for the main character. She's a sociopath and there is not one part in this book that makes you care about her."
4,Unputdownable!,"I can't remember the last time I was so absolutely riveted by a novel - and I read a lot. Wideacre is impossible to describe. It's like a combination of ""Gone With The Wind"" and ""King Lear"" with a bit of the Bible thrown in for good measure. It was fascinating to see how Beatrice's love for the land eventually twisted her into a truly evil woman. The writing was exquisite and the decriptions of Wideacre so beautiful that I could see every detail in my mind. The historical detail was fascinating, too. Although I was horrified by the depths of Beatrice's depravity, I could not put this book down. It will stay with me for a long time."
2,Almost Great,"At fist I was so excited to read another of Philippa's books after finishing the SO GREAT book THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL, and for the first 10 chapters I was hangging on just because I knew how good Ms. Gregory could write. But I could not read past chapter 13. Its horrid. So much incest, so many lies. I first wanted to see Beatrice, the main character, threw them but it was no use my mind could not handle it any longer. Anyone reading this do not buy this book, Read the OTHER BOLEYN GIRL instead its wonderfull."
1,"Shame on you , Philippa","If you loved Philippa Gregory's other books, as I have, steer clear of this one. It's trash. It's poorly written, sophomoric, overly dramatic and a tad depraved. I kept reading because I thought the main character would reveal a shard of redemption or character, but it never happens. Again, skip this one but don't miss ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" and the others."
1,SMUT,"I loved THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL and was excited to start this one. Disappointment is an understatement. I find it difficult to enjoy a book in which I have no sympathy for the heroine. I'm turning the pages only because I can't wait for her to get what's coming to her, only it can't come soon enough. Beatrice's lies, incest and selfishness drag on for pages and pages and pages. Needless to say, I will not be reading the next books in this series since I'm struggling to finish this one."
1,A Totally Horrible Book,"Except for the first few chapters of description, I hated everything about this book. Ms. Gregory is such a really fine writer of word pictues and so her descriptions of Sussex and Wideacre were amazing. But after that the whole thing horrified me. I skipped over many pages and chapters just to get to the end which left me totally depressed. Why does such a fine writer write such drivel?I should add that I realize she has to be an extremely talented writer to make us hate the main character so much. But I read to be uplifted and enlightened. And I want to care for the main character even if they are not perfect. I couldn't feel any of that at the end of this bookOn the other hand, when Gregory writes good stuff, there's none better."
1,Unpleasant,"I recommend Gregory's Tudor novels, virtually without reservation, but I thought this was dreadful. As with all Gregory's books, WIDEACRE is well written, though it desperately cries out for editing. Perhaps the author was trying to write an updated version of Scarlett O'Hara, but I found Beatrice completely unsympathetic. The book should carry at least an ""R"" rating, if not an ""NC-17"" -- parricide, murder, cruelty, consensual incest, sado-masochism -- ugh. Maybe she was just trying to get this first book published, and that's the reason for much the lead character's revolting behavior. Whatever. Don't bother with this. Go to the Boleyn books which I very much enjoyed."
3,"Classical teaching, modern presentation","Although the title would lead you to believe that this is a ""easy goin"""" type of book, this author has a grasp of Classical horsemanship methods. While the Masters books relay the same fundamentals, Marys presentation may let you see the Art of Riding in a less threatening light. Marys concern over how to use words to convey a skill based on ""Feel"" is especially appreciated, after all riding is really all about ""feel"" isn't it? She presents tools to convey this awareness, something that is not done as effectively in the older books. Her use of the ""indirect rein"" term is a bit out of sync with classical teaching, but all in all the title does not do the book justice."
1,Don't buy!,It's definitely for first year's students.But its title is very attractive and exagerrated. I have sent it back and taken my money.It's not worth a cent..Especially I have hate the blue drawn circuit diagrams..like a cartoon magazine..
3,Good for the Price,"I was actually searching for analog filters, and happened to bump into this text. The sole purpose of my purchase dealt with the format in which the Transfer Functions of the filters I was looking for were displayed. The purchase has paid off, for I was able to practically implement my design. Not a bad purchase for the price."
1,Junk,I would not purchase this manual unless the instructor mandated it. It has very few relevant examples from the book. I needed an example guide for the homework problems and it was worthless. I will try and resell it.
4,Pretty Good,But Be WARNED That The Table You Will Get Is Just Black Plastic And Not Like The One In The Picture
4,This was okay.,"Got what I ordered! The pieces fit together fine, but not the best. My son wasn't interested in it after a day.. but the ordering and shipping was a breeze."
2,Not impressed,I purchased these for my son to add to his wrestling collection. I was disappointed at how cheap the plastic is! The table will not fit together properly and my 8 year old son had a hard time trying to make it sit flat as it should.I would not recommend this product.
3,It served it's purpose,It is hard to compare the quality of these when I purchased a few items similar that came in the WWE rings and those ones were far better quality. My son was happy with them and he liked the ease that the table broke when he used it. It served it's purpose and for the price it was worth the money. I would consider ordering from them again.
5,Table and ladders WWE,My grandson just loves these wrestling props to go with his wrestling men. He can play with them for hours.
2,wrestling toy review,"These toys just were hard for us to keep putting back together so they could be broken again while playing with them. They were frustrating for the kids so they don't play with them,"
1,broke,I order this Item for my grandson for Christmas he has a ring and wrestlers already I thought this would be great for him.I took this item out of the some padded envelop and put in small box wrapped it for Christmas he took it out and one legs were broken now I'm gonna buy him something else if it's gonna break in a box I'm sure it would not last in a wrestling ring. I do not re command this toy.
2,Should have bought something else.,"I just realized this seller dropped the price of this item by $2 in less than 10 days from when we purchased.We got the item in a timely manner, but each item was in a cellophane package - no instructions. It's like it was a bulk item the seller had, but didn't necessarily pass along the savings to the customers.We can't get the table to cave in - in the middle.. instead, it wants to ""break"" up, so that each end goes down and the center cracks up. Then the cross bar on the legs broke off and the tabs broke with it, so that piece is just trash now. The table works, just not like you'd think with a wrestler being ""thrown"" on top it.. The ladder is just a ladder...If we'd have spent a total of 10 bucks, it wouldn't be so bad, but we spent just under $18 (my sons money he earned from dog sitting).. just too much for this item. He'd have been happier with a new wrestler. Oh well."
5,As The Romans Do,"Alan Epstein takes you in his book on a wonderful and enchanting journey to The Eternal City of Rome. I can relate to Alan and his family. I was in Rome in 1999 and fell deeply in love with this wonderful city and the infatuation hasnt left me ever since.This book is one of the finest about Rome. Alan takes you into the heart of what daily ecnounters are like in Rome. Among the people, the beautiful style of the women of Rome, how the bambini are cherished in Rome, and most of all the wonderful food of this magnificant country. Beware once you read As The Romans Do you will be quickly taken and find yourself rather quickly booking yourself a round way ticket to Rome. Great job Alan! This is for sure my favorite book on my favorite place of Rome. A great tribute to the Eternal City!"
1,POO as the ROMANS POOPOO BOOK REVIEW,"He insults his reader by assuming they have never stepped out of their trailer park long enough to now what ""mozzarella"" is. In short;I don't know how to describe how incredibly inane this book is, so I'll give you the description on inane, which explains this book better than I can...BECAUSE I KNOW I'M NOT A WRITER!Main Entry: inaneFunction: adjective1 : EMPTY, INSUBSTANTIAL2 : lacking significance, meaning, or point : SILLYsynonym see INSIPID"
3,"Some Insights, But You Have to Look for Them","I'm beginning to think that most travel essay books lately are written by wealthy men and women who have decided to sell their expensive homes and quit their well-paying jobs to move with their families to (insert location or around the world/country trip here). This book feels like one of those books. While Epstein gives some insights here and there about places and his observations of the people and daily life, sometimes it drags and it's more about what the Americans in Rome are doing vs. what the Romans do themselves."
1,Limited and tedious,"This book is not an American family's odyssey but pompous blather about a very limited slice of Roman life. Having lived in Rome, I don't agree at all with much of the author's perspective (one example: he brags that Roman women dress fairly formally, to the max -- but observation on the streets, restaurants, theater etc. shows that as in other European cities, some dress up, most don't. A small point perhaps, but revealing of a limited vantage point) Much of the book seems mostly about his ego."
1,Drivel!,"Clearly this author had two goals in mind: 1) to take advantage of the Americans-living-in-Europe publishing trend, a la Frances Mayes, and 2) to brag endlessly! I tired of reading about the author's expensive apartment and furniture, his Mercedes and his impressive friends after a few chapters and gave up on this. Too bad the author doesn't have the skill to write what the cover promised: an entertaining tale of a family living in Rome! Also too bad Amazon only put the 5 star reviews on the first screen -- I could have saved some money if I'd read all the reviews shown here!"
1,Don't waste your time,"This book is an infuriating collection of stereoypes, errors and prejudices.The author gives no sense of place and consistantly compares apples to oranges by using the example of affluent Romans in juxtaposition to suburbanite Americans, who have as much in common with his Italian neighbors as they do with their fellow countrymen living in New York City.He spouts facts, without having done the research to confirm the information and is too often wrong. I resent having wasted my time on this one."
5,"Good product , prompt delivery","The product is very good and the delivery was very prompt ... i will use this company again , Thanks , Steven Robertson"
2,Roll The Dice,"Your mother told you if things seem too good to be true, they probably are. This product is a fine example. Great price, maybe too great. I received 5 cartridges altogether, but not all four needed. I got 3 black,1magenta, a non-working magenta and no yellow at all. Order at your own risk."
1,they leak!,I bought these hoping for a quality replacement for less money.the set I got leaked and got ink all over my printer and desk.
3,"Heads Buy it, Tails leave it","I never knew that this album was Jo Dee's First, I always thought that ""I'm Allrigt"" was her debut CD, because I never found other albums from her. I listened to Heads Carolina, Tails California on the Radio and didn't know where it was. Then I found this album in a local Wal-Mart. I bought it just for one song and maybe that was the wrong thing to do, I really don't listen to any other part of the cd. For that I give it a split 3 star rating, but the song ""Heads Carolina, Tails California"" deserives a 5 star rating."
2,"OK album, but her next two albums were better","This debut album by Jo Dee Messina has to be a hit-or-miss. The best song is ""Heads Carolina, Tails Cailifornia"", but most of the tracks seem to be weak. Get ""I'm Alright"" or ""Burn"" instead of this one."
3,not her best work but good for a debut,Joe Dee is a great singer and this album does not give her jsutice but the Song Heads Carolina Tails California is great if you are a bug fan of hers get this cd but if you're only a minor fan you don't really need this album
2,Timex Women's Expedition Watch,"I had purchased this watch to match my husbands, as we have monagramed clothes. The battery doesn't work, and after taking it to the watch repair for a new battery, it still doesn't keep time. I liked the style but the watch doesn't have a long life to it."
3,Ok,"The condition of the jacket was pretty rough, torn in places, not quite like the picture advertised. Otherwise its ok"
4,Very Interesting Work,"I had the opportunity to meet Mr. Pacepa while he was a client of the Jamestown Foundation, where I was working.First, this book was not checked out in advance with the CIA or any other government agency as some reviewers have suggested. People would be very surprised at the frequently rough relationships between defectors and the US intelligence community. At any rate, the US does not dictate or control what these people write.Rather than focus on some of the many titilating stories in the book, this work is best used as a window on a very strict, ruthless dictatorship. Not many works can provide the kind of insight as this one."
3,disappointing,Superficial and disjointed in many ways. Did give some insights into manchinations of Ceausescus' regime but due to presentation style no certainty as to how factual scenarios are. OK as to superficial look but would not recommend book.
3,Self-serving yet a good read,"Pacepa's description of life among the Inner Party during the Ceausescu words is chilling. He documents abuses of power, cruelties, and downright stupidities among the ruling elite of Communist Romania, and shows why the Ceaucescus were so hated (and deservedly so) by average Romanians.It's too bad that he tries to exculpate himself at the end by showing himself to be a closet Christian and pro-American. It seems to me that he pulls this rabbit out of the hat near the end so his American friends and readers will overlook the murders, tortures and other atrocities he committed and abetted. (The Karla Faye Tucker defense.) By springing this surprise on the reader, the author makes us wonder: if he were really the pro-Western Christian he claims to be, would he have really aquiesced to even one of the horrors he describes? Wouldn't he have allowed himself to die before allowing hundreds of innocents to be slaughtered?"
4,Interesting Portrayal of the Conducator,"Ion Mihai Pacepa does a wonderful job in recounting the many conversations he had with Nicolae Ceausescu and other high-ranking Romanian communist officials. If you're the kind of person who enjoys Tom Clancy novels, this book is for you; it contains many tales of intrigue, espionage and deception as well as a shocking biography of the unscrupulous, hate-filled leader and his neurotic wife woven into each chapter."
1,Pacepa-Good; Ceausescus-Very Bad; Now you don't need to read the book!,"LT GEN Pacepa very obviously has an ax to grind in this book. Every chance he gets he takes a shot at the Ceaucescus yet never once admitting anything about himself that may be negative. He is always the effecient patriot in his mind. I am sure that no one ever gets to the position of power in a dictatorship such as in Romania at the time without being just as unprincipaled as his boss. Pacepa never admits any wrongdoing on his part. This was difficult to read because although at least partially factual, Pacepa is never honest. While the facts are damaging enough to the Ceausescus, Pacepa never passes up a chance to denigrate and belittle them in the most childish ways. If you want to learn about the regime and the country this is not the book to read. Having read this, I don't feel that I am any better informed than I was before."
1,Lopsided sea gull light,"I ordered this in October for my bathroom remodel. Unfortunately, I did not take a good look at it until our contrator was ready to install it in December. My 30 day time frame to return this item had expired. The arms of the lamp were not even when the base was level on the wall, and off by a good inch or two, making it quite visibly lopsided. There was no way to adjust the brittle metal without breaking it. Although the lamp looks beautiful in the picture, it's far from perfect in reality. I am now hunting for another light for my bath and out the money for the lopsided one. Sad story, but true."
4,"Nice, but it breaks easily","My nephews loved this, but it didn't last long. The string got tangled and slowed the yo-stick down then the string broke completely off."
3,Double Your Pleasure,"This is a delightful excursion into early-American ""kitsch,"" and these recordings, despite having been around for half a century, have held up remarkably well. If you like to hear music which makes no demands on you, these largely piano pieces are tuneful and charming, even if superficial.Although not noted here, this is a TWO-DISC set (the second CD - called Vol.2) is selling by itself here at Amazon for more than twice the cost! so this represents great value besides."
5,Great Military Thriller,Meadows has again written an outstanding novel about modern warfare. The characters are well developed and keep the reader wanting to read more. David E. Meadows is the expert when it comes to writing about the military of the twenty first century. He writes with authority and a style that keeps me wanting more. Keep up the great writing David. I look forward to the next enstallment.
3,"A good read, with some problems","Overall, a very good read and hard to put down. What spoils these books the most are some basic grammar problems, such as ""renown"", instead of ""renowned"" and many other such elementary school-type issues. Still, pretty enjoyable books for a relatively low price."
4,exactly what i ordered,I guess its difficult to mess up on this order but i do have other balloon orders that were quite disasterous. the balloons came nicely folded and packaged.
5,Can't beat the price,"Great price and great product. I have so far had this for over 6 months with absolutely no problems whatsoever. I feared that maybe with it being such a long cord and all, that it would have a hard to finding the signal or something....that fear ended up being a myth. The signal is great, and the product is about 1/8th what they charge for the same thing at retailers."
4,Inexpensive but ...,"These speakers seem to be sold under many names, so SHOP BY PRICE. Input is thru an earphone jack, so you can plug in any ipod or audio device that has an earphone jack(portable radio/cd player/mp3 player etc.)The sound is good for the price. Heavy bass will distort the sound-sorry no lush bass. And if you crank it up, it sounds distorted. These speakers runs on 4AAA batteries or a USB2 jack for your computer-included. (I bought a 6volt adapter for mine and tried it with the batteries in. Mistake! It began to melt.) This device uses batteries quickly. Also, the first unit I bought arrived broken because of cheap construction. It was replaced by the seller (not this one) without a problem. --I am happy with these speakers.-- And if they don't last forever, that's okay because they are so cheap. Again, shop by price. If these speakers look the same in the picture, they are the same. For best sound, adjust the sound levels on the iPod and the speakers."
2,Its okay,"I thought they were going to be really cool when i got these speakers. I was wrong. It was okay at first, then they got fuzzy and the sound is all distorted. I guess since they aren't expensive, you get what you pay for... so i suggest spending more money"
1,upset,"Buy many items from amazon because I can read others reviews. I bought this item because of reviews, I have a sneaky suspision that the people who submitted those reviews all work for the manufacture of the product.The machine peaks at three hundred, cooks poorly and is much slower than a conventional oven."
1,Not a very good product,"I have had numerous convection ovens of this type over the past 20 years, this one was noisy the first time I used it. The lip of the glass was delivery with a sharp edge thus cleaning requires great care not to cut your hand. Today the fan gave out after 10 months of use. I would not recommend this product."
5,LETS ROAST,"I CAUGHT A DEER IN MY YARD-PULLED OUT THE OLD BOW, SHOT,HIT THE TARGET. CLEANED, THEN TOOK PARTS FROM MY PREY TO THE SUPER TURBO OVEN-WHERE I BEGAN TO PREPARE MY NEXT MEAL. THIS OVEN IS SUPER SUPERB...MADE MY DEER MEAT MELT IN MY MOUTH AND NOT IN MY HANDS....HEE HAW...."
1,microphone case,"The case is too small and I will be returning it. The mics can not fit in the bag. We have wireless mics, maybe that's the problem. Wireless mics are much longer."
3,microphone case,"be sure to measure as the case does not fit wireless mics. I didn't do that and had to send it back because it was too shallow. Also, it did not have room for the charger unit so the case was useless to my equipment.Gator GM-4 Microphone Case"
3,"Great material, BAD sound!","I'm forced to agree with one of the previous posters...The sound quality of this recording is HORRIBLE! It was obviously recorded live in front of an audience and it sounds like the recording was done with a cheap machine in someone's handbag. Williamson's words are inspiring and she had lots of great stuff to say, if you can get past the poor quality. Lucky for me, I downloaded the recording at another site for a cheaper price than here at Amazon, or I really would have been POd!"
2,Bad CD quality,I love Marianne Williamson but this product should have never hit the shelves. The sound quality is very poor and I can barely hear most of it on a couple of the CD's. I am disappointed.
2,"OK for teachers, but be careful","If you are a Bible class teacher and know the Scriptures well, then you may find this book helpful for educating yourself on many current objections to Jesus and religion. However, be careful. The author states some things as facts that are directly opposite to what the Bible teaches. I would definitely not give or recommend this book to someone who does not have a good biblical background."
4,Best of the Uno card game sets,"When we were going through a torrid addiction to playing the Uno card game a few years back, we managed to find one of these 30th Anniversary edition sets. It proved a huge hit with the few friends who humored us by playing along, as well as my son, whose competitive juices are contagious. The specialty card is a ""Happy Anniversary"" card that allows the bearer to give all their cards, except for one, to any other player they choose. That's helpful when you see someone else with just one card in hand, on the verge of winning the game. This version is a delight to share with friends and family."
4,Great Beanie!,This beanie does the job in spades. Covers the ears completely and keeps everything snug. What's with the long washing info tag inside anyway? Do you really need to know how to wash a hat in six languages? Holy Smoke!
3,Great... if you want to look like an elf.,"Everything about this hat is great in terms of quality and fit except for one major show stopper--wearing this cap WILL make you look like one of Santa's little helpers. The back portion comes to a ridiculous point that cannot be mitigated by pulling the hat down tighter. I'm sorry, but I have no desire to join the ranks of Sylvan dryiads lurking about the forest. Hat gone back."
2,Looked & Felt Cheap,"I thought the material was different than what it actually was. What it is is a polyester hat. And, extremely goofy looking.Not for me."
2,"Display lasted 1 year, poor controls","I've installed many car stereos, and have had great luck with Kenwood home audio equipment. But after 1 year, the display went out on this unit so now I continue to use it ""blind"". One of the worst things is the 4-way toggle control on the right side. The problem is they made this a push button as well - pushing the toggle pauses USB and CD playback. It takes concerted effort to push that toggle w/o pushing it any of the 4-ways at the same time. A slight bump left or right will restart your song or worse, up or down will restart you at the beginning of a long playlist or CD. Terrible design flaw, and I'd not recommend this unit to anyone. Kenwood can do better than this."
2,Not rubbish but awful recording masters thanks to Tuff City,"Yeah y'all ""One For The Treble (Fresh)"" and ""The DMX Will Rock"" series are the only joints on this greatest hits CD by the man DAVY DMX. He sings,he plays bass,he's a super dope DJ. Tuff City Records messes this CD up with awful recorded masters (just like on the ULTRAMAGNETIC MC'S bootlegs. I-ight,CED-GEE was responsible for that,who or whom is responsible for this?).In my high school days,I was on the radio as a DJ and I wore out ""One For The Treble (Fresh)"". I had it on 12"" single,it was one of the most requested hip-hop songs on my show. Don't forget DAVY DMX produced and played some instruments for KURTIS BLOW before going solo (see ""8 Million Stories"",etc). I'm not knocking DAVY DMX at all,but this should have been a 5 song EP. I'm not knocking Tuff City either,it's just that they were a great indie record label (in the 80's) gone to...stink! Anyways,old school rule dawg! Don't you new aged rappers and DJ's forget it!!!!"
4,Original Hip Hop,I have been looking for this for sometime now. I think all the new hip hoppers should listen to this CD!!!! Funky!!!!
2,Rubbish album with a few good tracks,"Thanks to ""bille-kathy"" for setting this straight. Davy DMX aka DJ Davey D has NOTHING to do with DMX the rapper. Howeveer, this album is rather corny. I count 3 good tracks on it: ""The DMX Will rock (scratch mix)"" and ""Davy's Scratch"", and of course ""One for the Treble"" which is a classic and the only real reason for buying this album."
5,great,"great price, and great bits.sometimes the case is a little hard to open, but great value over all."
4,Let's Not Get Carried Away,"These are good bits and I applaud Milwaukee for making them in the USA. These may very well be the last Milwaukee bits made in the USA and I would encourage you to get them while you can. These bits probably ARE better than anything readily available considering the sad state of the times. However, I just compared these bits to 10 year old DeWalt bits in drilling through some thin galvanized steel and the results may surprise you. The Cobalt Milwaukee went through easy enough but the 10 year old US made DeWalt -nothing special I assume they are HSS - went through A LOT easier. I was surprised because I had heard so much about how great Cobalt bits were. Can you say a lot of crap? Now, you can't get these Dewalt bits anymore as the current ones are junk from China so that is why I say the Milwaukee's are probably as good as you are going to get but let's not get carried away."
5,Wish it were available before my trip,"Most people would buy a travel guidebook prior to the trip. I did it the other way round (I vacationed in NZ mid last year but bought the book one month ago). I certainly spared no time clicking the Add to Shopping Cart button when this title first appeared in the website. So... does the book measure up to my expectation? Definitely!!! The photos are great, the coverage on each area's attractions/activities extensive, and the maps up-to-date. It even covers information which I wasn't able to obtain from other guidebooks: special features on Coromandel gold fever, ""Wellywood"" (NZ's film-making industry), Nelson arts scene, West Coast coal-mining heritage, high country farming etc. If you need one book to show you how beautiful NZ is (in panorama and culture) and how to go about experiencing it, grab this book. You won't regret it. The editors have done a great job for a first edition. Be prepared to call your travel agent...!"
4,Poison's back!,"What can I say but great? The 5 studio tracks puts Poison right back on the map! Real great Poison tracks and you can hear that C.C. is back. There is a lot of energy in the songs. Just for these songs I would have bought this CD! There are also 12 live songs on it. This is like a live hits collection, much like Swallow This Live, so nothing special there. Again, only the 5 studio songs are well worth getting this album if you like Poison the way they were."
3,huge fan of poison,This album is not bad and not perfect. so so The recording of live songs are too bad and the guitar tones are not good.I am dissapointed. its better to listen swallow this live.its the one of the best live albums for me.
2,Power is Poison to my people,"I have been a Poison fan since I first heard ""Talk Dirty To Me"" in 1986. I stayed true with Native Tounge, when a lot of fans bailed. I bought the Greatest Hits, craving anything new. I loved Crack a Smile and have listend to it every day since it came out, but Power to the People is a huge let-down. PTTP is a decent track, and I hate every bone... is interesting with CC on lead vocals. But the tracks are poorly produced and the band is too hard. I listen to a lot of harder bands than Poison and love them, but that's not Poison. I'm all about change, but this was not the direction for Poison to take. The live cuts are also overkill. We heard these songs on Swallow This Live, and again on Crack A Smile: Unplugged. It's getting old. I'm still a fan and love the tunes. But unless you are a die-hard fan of the band stick to the Crack A Smile and Flesh and Blood."
2,Kinda Shakey,"I don't know about this new album. I mean I love Poison don't get me wrong and I by no means want to put them down. But I really don't like this album. The new songs aren't too great. Bret's voice isn't what it used to be and they need to get back to their roots as far as music goes. The live tracks are missing something too..... Fallen Angel and Something To Believe In don't sound as good as on Swallow This Live. I saw them this summer and they can still rock live as far as getting into it, but the music isn't what it used to be. I'd buy Crack A Smile instead of this album. Better luck to them next time... I know they still have it in them and can't wait till it breaks out!"
3,Do we really need another Poison Live Album?,"Let's see, Poison has 5 studio albums including the newly released Crack Up A Smile and 2 live albums including this Power To The People. I personally don't think live album is a great idea, I'd rather have a new studio album. The 5 new studio tracks are pretty good, from the heavy Power to the People to the ballad The Last Song. The one sang by CC is a great pop-rock song, probably my favorite from the bunch. The live tracks, we've had them before."
3,LAUGHABLE,"I must say this album was a let down. I expected so much more from what used to be such a catchy pop-metal band. CC Deville's ""I hate every bone in your body but mine"" is actually funny, and some of the old stuff is about all that is worth listening to on the entire album."
4,Power to the People,"Good CD. Not quite as hard hitting as Poison, but it's Brett Michaels not Poison. 3 track by far my favorite"
2,Only For Collectors,"Here's the problem with this album: It's thrown together without the benefit of production value. The live tracks are not ""raw"" - they suck production wise. Meaning: Whoever recorded Poison live for this album didn't know or care about doing the job correctly. Don't get me wrong, true Poison fans will dig CC's ""I Hate Every Bone In Your Body But Mine"" featuring DeVille on lead vocals but this album is a true disappointment. Collectors will like the first five tracks which are ""new"" Poison songs; albeit, new for 2000 when this album originally surfaced."
3,Buy it for the first 5...,"The new songs are cool, especially the C.C. tune. But what's the deal with the LIVE stuff??? I can't believe how bad the quality of the recording is. I have bootlegs that sound better. I'm sure Bobby Dall must've been playing on the live tunes, but I don't know why. You can't hear a single thing he plays.But the new songs make it worth your while, just to hear what Poison circa 2000 sounds like. I wish they'd recorded a whole new record and scrapped the live stuff."
5,"Great Album, but more new stuff would be nice","I just purchased this album, and I was very happy with it. I really liked the five new songs, and I wish they would have recorded three or four more. When I saw them in concert recently, they played ""Power to the People"" and ""I Hate Every Bone In Your Body But Mine,"" but I actually like the three others even better, especially ""Strange."" The live portion of the album is very strong, but not all that different than their previous ""Swallow This Live."" Still, buy it for the new tracks, and support this vastly-underrated band."
4,Power to Poison,"The album kicks off with 5 studio tracks, the last song""I hate every bone in body except mine"" sung by CC, which to my surprise was quite catchy, I may even buy the Samantha 7 record on the strength of it. The other 4 songs are very good and shall be listened to for many a day. With the live tracks you get nothing you have not really heard before, there are no tracks of Native Tongue or Crack A Smile which is a bit of a let down (maybe CC can't play em!). On the whole a good CD the live quality is not brilliant but you can tell that there have been no overdubs. If you are a Poison fan buy it for your collection if you are new to Poison just buy it anyway for the 5 studio tracks. END"
4,Solid,"This was an album that I've been wanting since I heard about it a year ago and I finally got it as a Christmas gift. It was worth the wait.This has five original songs, only one of which really deviates from the Poison tradition and that song is Powere to the People.Yes the title track of this album is a different direction for the band but good regardless.The other four will be recognizable instantly to the Poison Fan's ear.The real stand out of the record is I Hate Every Bone In Your Body But Mine sung by the one and only C.C. DeVille.The infamous guitarist flexes his singing skills on the song and actually sounds very good.The majority of the album however is live.There is nothing wrong with that though some believe it should've been left to the band's Swallow This Live album but I own that CD aswell and prefer Power to the People because it seems a more energetic recording probably due to the fact that the band had just reunited.Overall this is a solid peice of work."
2,"HEY GUYS, RELEASE SOME NEW SONGS PLEASE","These guys have released 3 compolation albums in their last 4 albums. Its time for a new studio FULL ALBUM. Hey dont get me wrong they need money right, to pay for C.C Deville's rehab and Bret Michaels acting lessons, and Rikki Rocket's haircuts. But gee whiz release a new album that doesn't have a version of every rose has its thorn or something to believe in. Those are great songs we all know. The 5 new songs are all pretty good exspecially strange and the last song but i wish there was 10 more songs. Please Poison No more b sides, long lost ""crack a smiles"", and mtv unplugged stuff. The C.C Deville song is a good song but the druggie cant sing. They should bring back blues or richie. Anyway if your a poison fan buy it because of the 5 new songs,but it wont attract any new fans."
4,Poison Power,This is different from what Poison has done in the past. I really loved it. Power to the People in an explosive song. Listen for your self!
4,good fun,"my only complaint about this cd is that the levels between songs is quite uneven so you have to have the volume controls within reach to compensate at times. otherwise i thought it was quite good and did a good job of capturing the feel of their tour from last summer. too bad they couldn't include the cover of ""rock n' roll all nite"" that they played last summer on the tour.nice to see that poison is still alive and kickin'"
1,trust me on this,"unless you are the biggest die hard poison fan on the planet, avoid this disc at all costs. of the five new tracks only ""hate every bone"" with vocals by C.C. has any redeeming quality to it. i had heard that the song PTTP was an attempt at ""heavy Poison"". Sorry, it's not. The live tracks which we've all heard before on ""swallow"" are recorded horribly. It is so muffled, and they included the solos from C.C. and Rikki. Puke. Does anyone even want to see the solos live let alone hear them on the cd? If you must own this cd, wait a couple of months when you can pick it up in the cut-out bins."
2,Terribly Overdone,"The over-the-top vocals and production makes this sound like pageant talent show music or something. The only songs I like are ""You Light Up My Life,"" ""The Rose,"" and ""I Believe."" She has such a great voice but is really trying too hard here."
1,PLEASE! ENOUGH ALREADY!,"LeAnn may have the beginnings of a great voice, but she needs to figure out what she wants to use it for. This is ridiculous. Is this the fourth or fifth cd in two years?"
3,Nice Try...,This CD was ok but lacks the appeal that Blue had. How the star spangled banner found it's way into it I'll never figure out. I didn't like Amazing Grace acapella. Gosh girl you made dog meat out of my favorite hymn. Stick to hard core country and you can actually make something of yourself.
3,"Alice Baltzersen, Denmark","LeeAnn Rimes truly has a good voice, and I haven't regretted buying this CD, BUT how can anyone compare her with Patsy Cline? No one - no one will ever come close to sounding like her. She had what I think LeeAnn lacks off: something behind the voice. LeeAnn is just a pretty voice, nice to listen to. But Patsy Cline had feeling in her voice, she had depth, tears, laughter, she had everything a gifted singer has.Don't get me wrong - I like listening to her voice - but why not stop at that - she has a voice worth listening to, but don't put her aside Patsy Cline! If LeeAnn could find it in her self to sing with some feeling she would definitely become a singer we all will remember, maybe for as long time as The Great Patsy Cline."
2,It would have helped if she didn't sing too LOUD on this one!,"This wasn't a good followup to Blue to me. It would have helped if LeAnn Rimes didn't sing too LOUD on this one! While the emphasis is on inspirational songs, the music comes off as overproduced, overblown and LeAnn tries to pull off her own Celine Dion by overdoing it a third on most of the ballads.Even the remake of Debbie Boone's overplayed You Light Up My Life comes off as limp. The listening performance comes off as as disturbing and misconceived, not inspiring at all as the album title wants you to believe. It's like LeAnn was pressured to get a record out on the market after the massive success of Blue. Would have been better if she sang an album of new material instead back in 1997."
2,"Great voice, insufferable songs","Leann Rimes is a very talented singer, but the sappy stuff she put on this album is nauseating. It's like having a recording of a church music festival. Its only redeeming value lies in the fact it can put anyone to sleep, no matter how much coffee they've had. The only listenable track on this CD is ""How Do I Live."" Buy the single, skip the album. I liked ""Blue,"" but this is unbearable."
1,It's such a waste!,"I like LeAnn Rimes. She has a great voice and her first album Blue was fabulous! But her last two have been great disappointments. She needs to sing her own songs, not somebody's elses. The Early Years album, I can understand. But what possessed her to release this odd-ball collection of songs. It's a cross between patriotic, gospel, and oldies album. It seems she just couldn't make up her mind. If you're gonna make a gospel album, then make it all gospel. The greatest puzzlement here is the National Anthem. By the time I got to that, I made up my mind that this album is just ridiculous. This is truly a waste of talent. LeAnn has so much potential and could be the next Reba, but releasing albums like these will just slowly decline her career. LeAnn, you can do so much better!"
4,How Could I Live Without LeAnn Rimes?,"This is such a great LeAnn Rimes' album! She has a very beautiful voice and just perfect for these gospel songs. These songs are that kind of you could sing in church. LeAnn Rimes sings with emotion. The song ""You Light up My Life"" is a great opener and there is very good songs like ""The Rose"", ""Bridge over Troubled Waters"" etc. There's no bad song in this album. However, the album has only a few excellent songs, rest of the songs are good but not excellent. I like the lyrics very much but there's something missing. Maybe it is that these songs are covers. However, a great extra for my LeAnn Rimes collection.Stars: You Light Up My Life, How Do I Live"
1,A change of direction is warranted...,"Granted this young woman displayed a great set of pipes on the single ""Blue."" But who is responsible for the sappy song selection and over-the-top production that runs throughout this nauseating disc? UGGHH!!!"
1,high school talent show stuff,"LeAnn Rimes has an undeniable gift of a voice -- big, bold, and expressive -- but what or who made her think she should release an album like this? This collection of covers and others reminds me of high school talent shows and pageant talent competitions."
5,"""LeAnn Fan"" Sensational","I enjoy this CD very much. I listen to the entire CD almost everyday. LeAnn has a powerful and sensational voice. I believe these type songs are suitable for her voice. My favorite songs are ""You Light Up My Life"", ""I Believe"", ""The Rose"", ""Bridge Over Troubled Waters"" and ""How Do I Live"". And don't forget our ""Amazing Grace"", ""God Bless America"" and ""National Anthem"". A mixture of Pop, Country and inspirational songs, I like it very much."
1,"so slow it'd take 10,000 years to listen to every song","this is full of slow, slow really slow songs. it is so sloooow you will fall asleep by the first song."
1,"A ""Declining"" CD","This CD is really pretty the first time you hear it... but the more you hear it, the more you can't stand it anymore. LeAnn just doesn't have the appeal to continually hold you."
1,An utter waste of excellent talent,"This collection of forgettable, tired-out tracks (""You Light Up My Life"" and ""God Bless America""?????) are an obvious attempt to simply cash in and make more money off a hot new star. These warbles may have been charming when LeAnn was six or seven but astute listeners won't enjoy them for more than one listening session. Wait for her next REAL album instead"
3,Lann And songs we love,this was when LEAnn rimes was 14 or 15 when she recored this in 1997 i like titel song and the rose a beauful music to listen to this a yes after Blue her first cd
2,Studio problem?,"Is it just me or is there a studio problem with this album? I can hear a jarring, screeching noise accompanying the music, especially with the ""The Rose"" track, which makes it impossible to appreciate an otherwise excellent album I'm sure."
3,Werner Hippler Lives! The best player ever in this league (see also my reviews of Der Clown & Straight Shooter)..read on.,"Interesting in that my first NFL('AAA')Ebook was also about the Scotland Clay-mores (now Cologne Centurians). JackCriner, childhood friend of both JohnRobinson and big John Madden gets theshort shrift in this one somewhat though.Could have left some of the controversialstuff out and made it more of a guys bookon Footie, in my Opine. I still liked itand much about my current CFL mate MarcusCrandell. - R.A.S, Montreal's AM 990, TheTeam, ""This Week in Arenaball"" host."
5,Wonderful Book!,"This is one of the best books I have read. It might be the best book about football ever. It gives a detailed account of what NFL Europe is really all about. As a fan of the league since 1991, I thought I knew almost everything about the league, but after reading this book, I learned things about it I never knew. The only flaw I saw in the book was that Mr. Anderson said that the World League became NFL Europe in 1996, but in fact it did not actually become NFL Europe until the 1998 season. Other then that it was a great book. A must for all football fans, especially fans of NFL Europe!!"
3,Not what I expected,"The cookies are okay, but not what I would call a breakfast food. They are not very satisfying for that."
4,Highly Enjoyable,"Despite it being a box office bomb, Cutthroat Island is one hell of an entertaining pirate movie. It has lots of action (most of it being over the top, but it's a movie), adventure, and VERY GOOD bombastic music. Now I wouldn't classify this film as a classic. It doesn't have that epic scale that Doctor Zhivago and The Godfather apprehend. The plot may be too simplistic (and characters too 2-dimensional). But despite all that, I don't care. This is for entertainment purposes only, and it does its job well.Grade: B+"
3,Good purchase,The movie itself was for someone else. It was delivered fast and had 2 versions on it. Normal and Wide screen which is what I wanted. I recommend buying from Amazon.
1,Trash extraordinaire!,"This has got to be the most crappiest, idiotic, pointless, shallow, boring film of all time! It has no logic whatsoever and the props are atrocious! The actors like Geena Davis and Matthew Modine are horribly miscast. This movie has no meaning and my friend said he'd bet me 20 bucks that I can't stay awake during this garbage. I asked, ""how bad can it be?"" I rented it, he watched over me so I wouldn't fall asleep. I lost the $20......"
2,DO NOT BUY THIS CD!,"Firstly, although I received the product in good time, the CD case cracked upon arrival. Second, I was very disappointed with the CD. This is an amazing soundtrack, to which the movie did no justice. If your a collector of soundtracks, this one is a must! But do not buy this extended version! Your wasting your money. The bonus track was a lousy synthesized version (yuck!) and the other previously unreleased tracks were OK...not spectacular in the least. The price I paid for this product was a huge mistake! Do not buy it. I have the original version (before this newly released version was released) and I have to say..............the original was better (so buy that one if you really want to add this soundtrack to your collection). This expanded version is a WASTE OF MONEY!! DON'T BUY IT!!"
1,still ten bucks?,Ok this movie is so bad they should try to give it away when you buy something else...but I guess people would still send it back.
2,Review- ( Not Worth It ),"I know that all Score fans, and John Debney fans will be mad at me, but I am only telling the truth. The reason I give Cutthroat Island a low rating is simple, because it has a great theme, but that is not good enough to save it from my rating. The only good tracks are "" Main Title: Morgan's Ride "", "" The Battle "" and End Titles. Out of about 23 tracks only 3 are good, but if you love this Score so much then maybe you should buy it. Good theme everything else is bad. Sorry. If I were you I would check out Willow by: James Horner."
1,worst movie I ever saw!,"I saw this movie on a double date in college because the other guy recommended it. Everyone agreed it was just about the worst movie we had seen and vowed never to let him pick the movie again. The dialogue is cliched and not acted well. Everytime there was a set up for a line, we would say it a second before the actor said the exact same thing and we had never seen the movie! There are many errors in the film. See if you can spot the sneaker imprints in the sand as they run up the beach. I guess maybe you could rent it for laughs if you just want to see a really bad pirate movie. I'm going to avoid seeing it again, thanks."
3,Geena Davis Superstar,"This is a sleeper big budget blockbuster with Geena Davis showing that she can carry a film like few other female stars. Although it was panned by the critics, Reggie Harlin, can deliver thrills and spills with the best of them. Highly recommended, especially for those Davis fans."
3,"Let's all go back to the thirties, please.","The old piratestory revisited. Yeah, right. But even the swashbucklers from the thirties had more plot then this. Sure, the action is great and the set is a pleasure to see, but that is where the fun ends. There is no acting and the plot is so rheadbare, that one almost wishes Geena Davis could use it as a dress. That would be sight for sore eyes! Maybe the next time someone makes a piratemovie, they will invest a little more in the script and a littleless in the scenery. In the meantime, go back to Errol Flynn or if you really want to see it in color, check ou Hammer's Devil Ship Pirates. That one is a bit underrated and largely ignored, but the sets are as good as Cutthroat Island's and the story is a hundred times better"
1,Shame on Lionsgate!,"What is the deal lately with the studios repackaging the old stuff, but making sound like it's new and improved!! I did the same thing, put down new money on the same version I already owned. The funny thing about this one is that the slip cover said widescreen and the case said widescreen and fullscreen which was not the case. I don't get it, somebody help me!!!!!"
5,Another great pirate flick.,Hi The girlfriend wanted this movie but its really a great flick with a really great story line about 3 competeing pirates with different pieces to a treasure map and Morgan adams(Geena Davis) winds up in the long run with all 3 pieces of the map her and her evil uncle fight over the treasure. This movie has lots of great action/adventure to it i like it a lot also for anyone who likes pirate flicks i highly reccomend this movie.
5,Great family action film,"As a mother of two preteen sons who are pirate crazy, I have to say this film was a great alternative to the Pirates of the Caribbean or other pirate movies that are PG13. Film has a few sensual moments but not nearly the level of sexual innuendo found in other films. Tons of action from start to finish, and Geena Davis plays a strong woman character. For the amount of pirate fighting there was hardly any blood shown. I had no problem with this film and the kids LOVED it."
4,Good Action & Character Dynamics,"Matthew Modine & Geena Davis played off one another very well. While the ending was somewhat predictable (boy gets girl) how they got there kept it interesting, and action packed,"
2,What a waste.,"When I heard about this movie I was hoping for a revival of the old swashbuckler genre. Instead, I got Cutthroat Island. A lot of money wasted on a sort of overblown B-movie. The stes look grate, the fighting is acceptable, theleads are hopelessly miscast and the plot is so thin, that I wish the Geena Davis could wear it as a dress. Now that would be an interesting sight! A lot more interesting at least than this movie, that just moves from one scene to another, without any story to keep them together. There are heroes, there are villains and there is a whole lot of stuff inbetween, but the connection seems to be a bit lost. Sorry guys, but some viewers like to see a little more then explosions. A bit of suspence would be nice. So would a story!"
1,How can you like this movie!,"How in the hell can somebody like this movie,this must be one of the worst movies of all time.Me and my friend watched a lot of movies one weekend and tried to find bad things from good movies and good parts of bad movies.When this movie came along we had a helluva time trying to find good parts.The only good part we found was that there isn't any other modern pirate movie.Truly bad and badly acted.Why cant i give it zero stars(deserves actually -5 stars)"
1,Only one reason to watch this movie,"Alright, first things first. The only reason I gave this movie one star is because there are explosions. Aside from that, this movie is on a list I've been compiling of the worst movies of all time. If you, like myself, enjoy watching bad movies for the sole purpose of laughing at the poor attempt at ""art,"" then buy this movie. And, while you're at it, buy something to hit yourself with when you are done watching this, trust me, you'll need it."
3,Not as bad as its reviews made it out to be.,"Cutthroat Island had lots of potential, but didn't quite live up to it. Not that the movie is bad. It's just that some of the acting was disappointing. For the first half of the movie, Geena Davis' character, Morgan was kind of unbelievable. However, Frank Langella's portrayal of the villain, Dog, was nothing short of spectacular. Awesome sets and beautiful costumes make this movie a must see for any pirate fan!"
3,Wonderfully Cheesey,If you're looking for a serious pirate movie stop now. If you're like so many pirate movie fans and have come to realize that there is no such thing dig in and enjoy. These movie is wonderfully cheesy and yes overacted at points. But its a great beer and pizza movie. Something that can be watched several times and enjoyed.
5,A Great Piece of Entertainment,"I don't really know why I originally bought this DVD, but I am very glad I did. There are plenty of other reviews here that give you an idea of the movie itself, so I won't bother. If you are looking for a movie that is extremely entertaining and an enjoyment to watch several times this is it. (This is one of only a handful of movies I've seen more that 2 or 3 times.) If you're looking for some deep, moving, emotional or mental experience, you're considering the wrong genre to begin with. Want some great fun for a couple of hours, you've found it."
2,Don't waste your time with this film.,"Pirates go after gold and then only to be asked to give it up to continue the life of being a pirate. There were some cool stuff like two big pirate boats shooting at each other. Explosions were somewhat convincing. Nonetheless, this was almost a ""B"" movie. Why Geena Davis take the role who seemingly kept clean clothing throughout the movie even after the fight scenes, is beyond me. Don't waste your time with this film."
4,"Do ye take doubloons, matey?","I heard this sound track at an exhibit on pirates at the San Diego Maritime Museum a few years ago. It was terrific. This is my favorite swashbuckler sound track, next to ""The Mark of Zorro."" We plan on playing this in the car on the way to Renaissance Festivals to get into the mood. Aarrgh!!"
5,Give it a try,"This is the best movie score of the last 20 years, and its association with a horrible movie is so unfortunate. So many movie scores are either 1) under 40 minutes, or 2) interspersed with dreadful songs, or 3) consist of repeated themes over and over again. This score does none of these things, and I cannot figure out why it does not get more recognition. The main theme is addictive, and also very different. Each track offers something new and different, from softer ones including harpsichords in the background to loud an bombastic ones backed up by a large chorus. Throughout it all is an incredible sense of rhythm and texture that gives new meaning to the term ""swashbuckling."" Much of the score gives reminders of scores of the past, such as those of Korngold and Elmer Bernstein, but it is definitely unique. This music puts the movie to shame."
5,If you're in the mood for a Pirate Movie.... this is it!,"I love this movie.Geena Davis is great as an action hero, (here and in ""The Long Kiss Goodnight) I love the whole corny Pirate story, just like in ""Pirates of the Caribbean , only when this was made it seemed everyone (critics) thought it wasn't cool enough to make a pirate movie, and that a woman wasn't a credible action hero. My, how times have changed in ten years. This is a fun movie... it is not meant to change your life, just a fun Pirate movie. I could use more movies like that."
3,Great Action but Poor Acting,"The film was entertaining and contained some GREAT shots and battle scenes with EXCELLENT music, however I think that the bad acting and lack of character development really hurt it. The reason that this film did so poorly in the theaters (grossed 11 mil. and cost 100 mil.) can be seen by watching the exceptionally horrible theatrical and teaser trailers featured on the DVD. Had this movie been properly advertised I'm sure it would have broken the 100 million marker. I don't think that you should pass up on seeing the movie just because of the acting. I suggest renting the film for the excellent cinematography and musical score ard seeing if that is enough to pursuade you to purchase the film, but if you really like adventure films with lots of amazing action and stunts then this is the film for you."
3,"Granted, it's not the best movie of all time...","Well, to say the least, Cutthroat Island is an absolute bomb - it earned scathing reviews and hardly any money. Still, as a bomb it does its job. Granted, this movie's plot should be clear to you once you have read the blurb on the back of the carton. Granted also that the movie features lines such as ""do you think I was born last tuesday?"" And yes, Geena Davis can't act and Matthew Modine looks like he needs a pee break in the near future. But please don't tell me you watch pirate movies for a plot! If cannonfights, swordfight, kicks in genitalia, carriage chases, fistfights, treasure maps, explosions galore is what you are looking for - you've got it. And better done than in many superior movies: The setpieces are beautiful, the action scenes bombastic. Just fast-forward the plot-driven parts of the movie... or laugh at them..."
1,It's a shame I have to give this ANY stars,"I found this to be a mind-bogglingly stupid film. Bad acting, miscast actors, bad script, bad direction, laughable plot. If you feel an irresistable urge to see this film, just hit yourself in the forehead with a hammer. It will feel the same and you'll save some money by not renting this garbage."
5,Very Good,"For years there has been a legend in Moran Adams family about the Spanish gold her Granddad buried. Now she, her father and her uncles are in a race to reach it first(and you can guess who wins). With a little help from a convict(who you might remember from the Princess Bride) the pirates go off in search of the treasure.Overall-Reminds me allot of the pirate action flicks of the 50s, you just have to like pirate movies."
2,"Arr, another pirate movie!","If there's one thing that film-makers should know, is that pirate movies are risky buisness. CUTTHROAT ISLAND holds the undesirable distinction of being the biggest box office bomb of all time. It's overblown, messy, and worst of all, not very entertaining. Director Renny Harlin (Die Hard 2, Cliffhanger) seems to have forgotten the one crucial rule to these kinds of films, and that is, story before spectacle. That's not to say it is devoid of merits; there are some impressive battle scenes, it has a great musical score and Geena Davis is good, but it leaves the viewer ultimatley unsatisfied. Ignore it's glaring flaws, however, and there is some fun to be had. DVD extras include a trailer."
2,WORST THING FROM HARLIN !,"I stopped watching it at the middle of this movie, then took courage and watched the other half. Geena DAvis is horrble, like Modine too. Everything is forged, forced, not natural, not a good action movie at all !"
1,Excellent Story; DVD Just Doesn't Make the Cut,"I caught this movie in the theater. I loved it. As soon as the DVD was released I purchased it with great enthusiasm. When I got home and played the DVD I discovered, to my great disappointment, that it is in the wrong format and displays with very poor quality. The video looks horrible. I returned the DVD for a refund.Technical Details for the curious:While this DVD offers both full-screen and wide-screen versions of the movie, the wide-screen version is not anamorphic. That means when you play it on your new TV it just looks bad. If you have an older TV and don't care about video quality you probably won't notice or care about this.I just don't understand. If you're going to stick with VCR-quality transfers, why bother making a DVD. Oh, I forgot. A DVD disc costs pennies so it's cheaper than ever to dump trash on consumers. I'm so glad we have these forums to share this information."
2,Bad Pirate Movie,"Characters not developed.Bad Acting.Poorly Cast.Story is very weak.Some good scenery.Good values, bad movie."
5,A swashbuckling yarn of epic proportions,"If you liked Pirates of the Carrabean, then you will love it's predescessor Cutthroat Island. A great tale of gold, treasure and buccaneers. An adventure on the high seas with a heroine played by the devine Geena Davis who pays Morgan, captain of the rag-tag crew bound for a treasure hunting trail which starts in the infamously piratical paradice of Port Royal."
5,Review of Cutthroat Island,"This movie is an excellent film. It captures the time period wonderfully and the cross between romance, action, and comedy that the movie incorporates adds a special touch that really brings this movie to life. Geena Davis is a great actress, and this movie helps excentuate that fact. I highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in pirates or just having an edge-of-your-seat great time. There is violence, so I wouldn't show it to anyone under the appropriate age."
4,"You'll dig Digger, he's as smooth as the best Vodka.","I don't know whether or not they had a wager or how the Digger series came about, but after I read Warren Murphy the first time, I searhed for all the titles he had written. The Digger series is a fun and interesting read. The characters are complex and real. Do yourself a favor, if it's out of print, find a copy somewhere and read Digger, he's Spenser without the attitude."
4,"very childlike, but still passionate","I live in Japan right now, and must say that normal J-pop doesn't do much for me, (except of course for Utada Hikaru). Yes, you will not understand a word, and yes, it's hard to justify the import price, but Chara is incredable. Think, Jewel, except VERY childish voice and really good sence of rythem. Most J-pop is like the Spice girls, but this is a welcome exception. (and this albumn is her best of the five."
5,Exelente cantante!,"Debo decir que es un exelente imprete, creo que se nesecita mucho talento y efuerzo para lograr ser exitoso.En mi opinion, el mejor de la hepoca es Ricardo."
3,Good 70's action flick,"This is an interesting movie, especially in light of what's happened in this country over the last 30+ years.Filmed in and around the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in 1976. Very low tech by todays standards, but that is part of the appeal. It's always fun to see the old cars, fashions and technology.There is a long list of stars, as with most movies of this era: Charlton Heston, John Cassavetes,Martin Balsam, Beau Bridges, Gena Rowlands, and even Walter Pidgeon as a pickpocket.The plot revolves around an unidentified sniper during a championship football game with a sold-out crowd. Unfortunately, you never learn his identity, his target or his motivation.There are some terrible lines in this movie. The acting is fair to good. The best scene was near the end, when the police are shooting it out with the sniper, and the television crews are watching it all from their trailer.Overall it's a fair movie that's intersting as a snapshot of our culture during the 70's."
3,Exciting As Panic Strikes,"What attracted me about ""Two-Minute Warning"" is the idea of seeing the people at a stadium running for their lives as a sniper shoots at random during a football match. Also I like watching Charlton Heston playing good guys on disaster movies during the 70's. Also I have to admit that John Cassavetes' SWAT commander is also kinda cool.However, the movie has its flaws at presenting the different characters and their personal dramas. Sometimes you end up saying what the hell is David Jansen playing a cop with no personal drive, except hitting on Gena Rowlands. And what was the motivation of this sniper to start shooting at everybody in the stadium? I think director Larry Peerce should have taken care of this detail.The scenes of the panic in the stadium were very attractive, and that's the real treat of ""Two-Minute Warning"". It's too bad this DVD doesn't have a behind-the-scenes featurette. Only those production notes that keeps you wanting for more information."
1,You've got to be kidding me,"See Leonard Maltin's review. I love Chuckie, but this movie has no point other than violence is senseless. I already knew that."
5,Two-Minute Warning,"Charlton Heston and what more can you ask for? Slow Paced except for the start;Bam!some crazy perhaps A LeftwingNutjob and/or anarchist out there harming people.Heston is good for the job,I can think no one else except him or Eastwood or Bronson but the movie is an intense thriller and good except Martin Balsam(Red).I saw it on Netflix and I would buy the film;In fact I will buy it.Sure,it's part of the whole genre of 70's Disaster Flicks that came out but I find it quite enjoyable and Love the part when it is commented about ""Criminal's Rights"" and the Public as they say,which takes it back to Dirty Harry and the quote to that extent.A Action-Packed movie from when movies were great."
5,good movie,"very unique movie. done very well. violence is not thrown in your face, you know this faceless man is going to shoot to kill, but you never really know when.this movie shows very lttle blood so its not a goory fim at all.this film is very under rated,its to bad few people have seen this film, i seen this film when it came to theaters and i loved it and highl recommend this film,very good movie, worth the money to rent or buy"
3,Dated but good.,Not a big fan of Charly Heston. I wanted the film for all the actors who were brilliant. Strongly suggest to get it for all those suporting and helping a lame script.
2,coffee pods,said it could be used in a kcup machine. that is not always true. the grind is to fine and you had to remove the covering. might be okay if used in a proper machine
3,The ending wasn't what I thought it should be,"I truly enjoyed this book. I liked the characters and the character development. Unfortunately for me the ending just didn't cut it. The heroine was this spunky, intelligent, go-for-it gal and at the end she crumbled into this ""I can't do it creature"" that I didn't recognize. I rewrote the ending in my mind and it was great."
4,Ship of Dreams,"A romantic read from around the late 1800s and steam shipping. It starts immediately into the actual story with no wondering what's what. It's based on reality at the time and provides an interesting insight to the travel, safety at sea, dining at sea, trading and social strata. I identified readily with the main character and felt her dissappointment before the final resolution. A good relaxing read unless you want action packed drama."
3,"Pretty good book, I give it 3-1/2 stars","This book was pretty well written for a freebie. I found a few slight errors, including the following sentence: ""'Ansel assures me that I'll feel much more the thing if I get some fresh air' Addie Easton said..."". I have no idea what that was supposed to say! But the plot kept me interested, although it did go into what seem to be the obligatory details of the steamy sex scenes that some novelists like to write about, but which I always skip over. I would recommend this book, which is based on a true incident but the story is fiction."
1,Couldn't stand to finish it!,This hackneyed formula romance was really boring. I read a number of pages into it but found that I had no interest in the characters or the plot. That is a recipe for a one star review. I also removed it from my Kindle as I have no interest in continuing.
3,mixed opinion,"This is a coming-of-age story, with Community Theatre serving as both a background and a catalyst for the growth. I'm very involved with Community Theatre myself, and much of what is written here rings true. However...The grammar and spelling in this book are atrocious. I can't tell if this was a purposeful decision by the author, since the story is being told by a 15 year old boy, or if it was just plain sloppiness by the author. All I know is that it was annoying.Also, you should be aware that there is a fairly high sexual content to the book. Personally I don't have a problem with this, but some people do (and I wouldn't give the book to a teenager to read)."
3,Can someone from Omica please reply?,"Omica Organics claim that their zeolite comes from a ""...source which is uniquely free of impurities. Omica Organics maintains a naturally clean source of zeolite, and we feature only this clean proprietary zeolite in our supplements.""This is impossible given the facts about zeolites. All zeolites in nature are ""dirty"". This is because zeolites are negatively charged and are considered molecular sieves; collecting positively charged ions is exactly what they do even out in nature. So for any company to allude their product does not need cleaning because it is so pure is either deception or they have not done their homework on the science behind zeolites.If a company contends that their product is the most ""pure"" zeolite - this could be true, in theory, but this would mean the zeolite would need all the more calcination because the more pure the zeolite the ""dirtier"" it will be. It is not wise (?or safe) to ingest improperly calcined zeolite.Comments?"
4,Good Product,"I am definitely feeling the affects of this product, I caution everyone to be careful before detoxing, because this product will do just that, the process is not pretty but it's all worth it to have a clean system. There will be detox symptoms that will eventually pass, with that said I plan on being a repeat customer."
4,pretty good for lead detox,"I work in a plant that makes lead acid batteries. We are exposed to lead all the time, mostly as dust in the air. If we work in certain locations in the plant we temporarily must wear a respirator. The goal is to keep your blood leads down below 13 mcg/dcl. Then we don't have to wear a mask all the time. I struggled for the first ten months to keep my levels below 13, trying various things. After using this product as directed for two months, I went from a 16 to an 8. Good stuff. I am switching to a modified citrus pectin as an experiment for the next two months, because my last blood draw was a 12, and I am thinking I should rotate treatments. We'll see. I bought the MCP here on Amazon, and I'll review it in two months after my next blood draw. I only reccomend buying this brand. There is a big scam out there with companies diluting, so be careful."
4,CLASSIC BEYOND AGES,"Enough can't be said about this 1980 release by Motorhead. taking rock to the extreme, they defined a new style of aggressive metal. It's astonishing from track one ttil the end !!. Lemmy, Fast Eddie and Taylor work close to perfection. It's amazing, a clear evolution since their last effort, BOMBER."
5,Hard - driving metal at it's best!,"Excellent! Ace of Spades is full of fast riffs, fast drums and Lemmy's gravel-like voice. This is their best work yet. ""Shoot You in the Back"",""Road Crew"", ""Jailbait"", ""Fast and Loose"" and ""Live to Win"" are all rhythmic, not absent minded pounding. I could do without ""Love me like a Reptile"". ""Dance"", ""Fire Fire"" and title track ""Ace of Spades"" rock very hard. Satisfying for Heavy Metal tastes. If you like Metallica, you'll like this album. This album takes me back to high school."
4,"i just copped this, been lookin 4 it","i dont like east coast rap that much. only for 1 reason tha beats. this album would have been among the top 10 of all time if the beats were tighter. methodman is one of the tightest lyricist out there. redman is one of the funniest and creative. they're a perfect combo. but unffortianately this album was like a combo meal, but without the drink. meth bein the burger, red bein tha fries, and the beats bein the drink. get this if u like east coast rap. if u from the west coast it will grow on u."
4,Pretty Good,"I don't have much to say about this album. It is very entertaining. My only problem was that it seemed to, so a small extent, favor Method Man, whereas I like Redman better. They're both good though. The beats are ok. Nothing special, but not bad. Lyrically, its not really ABOUT anything, which kind of bothered me, but it's good none-the-less. The best songs are: Maaad Crew, Cheka, and 1,2,1,2, Da Rockwilder and Well All Rite Cha."
4,BlAcKoUt!,"Well, er'body knew that it wuz gon happen. Tha Ticallion Stallion and Funk Docta Spot finally hit us with an album. Both Meth & Red shine on this album and the guest apperances are good, also. From LL Cool J's shocking verse on ""4 Seasons"" to Ghostface Killah on ""Run 4 Cover"". Lyrically, Meth & Red give 100% on each verse, but this album also lacks in variety when it comes 2 production. If you're focusing on tha production of this piece, you would have to be more of a Def Squad fan because Erick Sermon takes up tha bulk of the project. While the likes of DJ Scratch, The RZA, & Mathematics do contribute one or two tracks, this seems more of Erick Sermon's beats tha majority of the time. The Wu-Tang element isn't very ""present"" on tha LP. And yes, a few joints get rather annoying, but other than that, the two mesh well 2gether and this sh... still bumps in tha trunk! Can't wait till tha next one!"
3,"Less then impressive, more a 2.5 than a Three","Ya'll probably gonna hate me for this, but really, the Blackout album is ""aight"". Like an earlier review stated, the beats are, at best, less than standout. They're not wack, per se, but to someone who listens to Hip-hop alot, there not the BOMB either; ""Cereal Killer"" a cut that everybody here seems to like, was used first by The Coup, and more effectively at that. ""Maad Crew"", uses a relatively new sample for its beat, ""Sandworms"", which is featured in the Mushroom Jazz collection that came out just a year or two ago ( it's a beat too new to be used, imho ). But Funk Doc and the Ticalion Stallion come correct with there charismatic flows, and they do have a certain chemistry that is hard to beat. Hard-core fans probably already have this album, but for the others, save your money for Mos Def's new joint, "" Black On Both Sides """
3,The only review you need read.,"Don't listen to anything anyone else has said about this album, listen to me. I know what im talking about. Method man and Redman are by far 2 of the most talented rappers that exist. This album isnt solid all the way through, but it is definately worth owning. There are plenty of tight songs here that will become your favorites for a while. Looking back on this album, i wouldnt trade it for anything, i have had some good smoke sessions to this album and so will you, there are some classic's on it. Just keep in mind that the ' skip ' track feature on your CD player will probably come in handy a few times. Otherwise, it makes my top 50 list."
4,Method man is the Man,"I'll give this one 4 stars simply b/c of Method Man's brillance. Redman is there, but u can hardly pick up his wack, makes-no-sense lyrics. Meth is a rap god, his flow is so sick u hafta listen to everyday. His rhymes flow continously, webbing together great verses that leave you bobbin your head. The duo works great together, putting together a high-energy album that will soon be a classic."
4,"Definately Wild, something expected from the goofy duo","Yo youn these hip hop heads most def rippin it on this cut! A much anticipated classic from these cats! These beats if off the chain, and they lyrics is straight silly. The intro definately prepares u for the jambary of off the wall lyrics these heads be delivering. A must buy for any Wu-Tang, meth man, or redman fan."
4,Hip Hop's Dynamic Duo of Lunacy,"Finally, the two MC's that most complement each other come out with an album! Ever since ""How High"" (wisely included as a bonus track), Method Man & Redman have been providing hip hop with some of the most crazy, off-kilter, but altogether most creative lyrics heard today. Once you combine these great skills with top-notch production (Erick Sermon, RZA, Mathematics, DJ Scratch, Rockwilder, and Redman himself)you get a very good album. It's not as good as The Roots ""Things Fall Apart"", but can you really compare it to that?"
4,Meth and Red Together for a Whole Album!!!,"Method Man and Redman fit so well together. Their personalities are almost identical and when they share the mic together their contrasting styles blend together perfectly. This is a great album as many fans have been waiting for more of these two guys together, since they have teased us with some stellar guest appearances with each other over the years. Songs like ""Blackout"", ""Cereal Killer"", ""Run 4 Cover"", and ""The ?"" are everything everyone could have expected and more. I have almost no complaints about this album except for a few small things. The song ""4 Seasons"" is straight amazing with LL Cool J killing his verse until a misplaced guest appearance of Ja Rule pops up.And a ""How High (remix)"" appears on this album. Although this song is great I wish they would've put the original on this album. I'm sure no one would've minded one extra song on the album. If you like anything Red or Meth has done, cop this one right away as it won't disappoint."
5,Album of the Year!,"Method Man and Redman. It seems like a bizarre duo at first. Heh, but then you hear the actual lyrics and say ""Damn, this is good"". Many of the songs are great. Minus one or two of them. You like Hip Hop/Rap? This album was made for YOU. I bought the album as soon as I could........why dont YOU? Trust me, its well worth it. In fact, I made a copy of the CD on my CD-RW drive so if the original got scratched, I have backup."
4,This CD is tight!,"I'm not the kind to just buy a CD without listening to a couple of the songs first, but I just decided to be impulsive. I'm so glad I was! This is one of those CDs you wanna bump in your car all day long, and that little skit spoofing Blair Witch Project is mad funny. My favorite song is gotta be ""Maad Crew"". I'm gonna do a lot more impulse buying from now on."
3,"Very, very, disappointing","Method Man and Redman on the same album? Yes, I couldn't believe it either. You have two of the greatest rappers of all time collaborating on something other that a weed smokeout. This could have potentially been one of the greatest rap albums of all time.......had it been released in 1995.First off, the production is solid, but since Erick Sermon is the principal producer, solid isn't good enough. The result of that is that Meth and Red give solid rhyming performances, which is good enough for lesser rappers, but not for them. Are these the same guys who rapped on classics like ""36 Chambers"", Whut ? Thee Album"", ""Tical"", and ""Dare Is A Darkiside""? I don't think so. They passed their peak as skillful lyricists in the mid-90's East Coast resurgence,but it hasn't dawned on them yet, I guess."
5,best rap cd yet,if yall blaze up u need to pic this album up thats only if you like the best hip hop ever youll find out check track 2 6 7 forget that put it in press play light up and prepare your self
4,Good warm voice,"My sister and I visited Alberta & British Columbia last October. During our visit, our Canadian friend introduced us to Laura Smith. We played her (old) CD in the car while driving on the beautiful roads of AB & BC. We liked her voice so much that I ordered the CD right after our return. It brings back wonderful memories but it also prompts me to discover more albums of hers."
1,silly book,it is an utterly silly book written by a simpleton. I lost all my money and time invested in reading the book. I advise others to remain away from this nonsensical book
5,Long Shank,"This is one great product when you have to drill & feed wires in an attic. it sure sends it out to the other side of the rafters, if you have to get between footers and rafters there you have it. if you use 7/16"" hex ends and need extensions this is one way to go. they vary from 24"" - 18"" - 12"" what ever you need"
4,Does what I needed it to do,I wanted something to read temps in my house. This did the trick (though I'm sure there are other items out there that are more accurate).
4,If you were in San Francisco in 96-97,"If you were there then you know Alice 97.3 was (and still is) the premier Modern Rock radio station. This collection is a good compilation but a lot of stuff played all the time is missing. Where is ""Your Woman"" by White Town or Daft Punk's ""Da Funk""? Right on the money is the inclusion of Luscious Jackson and Sneaker Pimps. Amazing this was ten years ago already."
1,Crossroads of Twilight,This series which began with such hope and great writing has now come to a complete standstill. It appears that Mr. Jordan is now just throughing words on a page to describe everything in inane detail just for the money. I give up on it.
1,Do NOT buy this book,"Hopefully you read this before you buy. Nothing happens in the book. Everything is stalled until the next one. If you MUST find out something about the book, go to a bookstore and read the last 4 pages. That is all that is interesting in the whole thing.It's sad that such a great series has turned so bad. Good writing, good characters, good plot, has turned into, bad writing, predictable and cloned characters, with zero plot movement.Mr. Jordan has claimed over and over that he's had the last scene in his head for 15 years or more now. It would do us all a big favor if he just wrote it down and posted it on some of the Wheel of Time boards and started something new."
1,I'm trying so hard to finish.....,"Ugh!I'm so disappointed in this book. I'm just about finished reading it. It's taking me FOREVER, and I bought it the day it was released in hardback. At first, I was such a fan, but this book goes nowhere so slowly I find myself putting it down every time I pick it up, it's that bad.I won't spoil anything, but I will say that Jordan writes about everything unimportant, and very little about the main plots of the story.I am entirely fed up with the petty power struggles among new characters. I am tired of the petty power struggles among old characters, which doesn't happen much because the book is so full of new characters.What happened to the story?"
1,Absolute dreck,"Unbelievable. Reads like an author just spewing words in an effort to collect another paycheck.Give up on this series. Or at least skip this one, you won't miss anything. Seriously, not one thing."
1,"694 reviews, and only 26 5 stars","Just goes to show that in any group of humans, there are always the credulous and stupid.Robert Jordan is only interested in capitalising on the hunger created through the brilliance of his first three to four books.If he has any shred of pride or dignity, he will sit down and rewrite everything after book three. In that way we'll have a series of about six books that will be Jordan's marvelous legacy for generations, (a la Tolkein).Unfortunately, he is a lazy and greedy ""author"", with no intention of ever completing this series, and every intention of emptying our pockets."
1,as terrible as 9 was great,"Don't rush out to buy the hard cover ... you might even be able to skip this one altogether. ALMOST NO ACTION. For books 9 and 10 of the series it's as if he took one book, put all the action and intrigue into 9 and ALL the description of clothes, what the soup tasted like, etc. into 10. Sorry, I love the series, and I'm not harshing the author, but after the great read of 9 I was sorely disappointed by 10. Then, after a whole lot of nothing really, he leaves the book a cliffhanger ... that we can expect to wait 2 or 3 years to resolve? Wah."
2,How to read RJ's WoT without end up pulling your hair out,"Well, it WAS a good series with good storyline until (I forgot which book), the filler portion began to get larger and larger.After several attempt of frustrating reading, I develop rules to read WoT and I suggest you apply it in this book as well since it's basically NOTHING.- Found long description(scenery,clothes,places,physical appearance,etc)? SKIP!- A chapter of irrelevant character (Galina Casban, Alliandre, Padan Fain,etc)? SKIP! No, you won't miss anything important by skipping the whole chapter. In fact it'll save you from the stress of expecting the chapter to end everytime you turn the page.- Personally, I only read the whole chapter when it comes to certain characters: the ta'veren, Elayne, and Egwene since I think they hold the key to the progress of the story. For the less-important-but-have-to-read-character, I read while skipping all the descriptions."
1,The Wheel of Time is not turning!,"Robert Jordan played a nasty joke on his readers with 800+ pages of stalling (no plot advancement, nothing revealed). It is almost hard to believe, but I actually experienced it. This book numbs the mind and steals hope. This book is the oft-referred-to void.If you are reading this series, please skip this book, you truly wont be missing anything. It can only make you want to give up on the series."
2,Tragic in retrospect,"I really wanted to love this book. Some of the previous books were a little slow, but I still enjoyed them. This one did not do it for me. If you dig deep, some important information is passed along, and a few events of significance take place, but not enough to justify an entire novel. Everything of importance in here could have been worked into the subsequent book on a much smaller scale. When I did my traditional reread of the series prior to the Knife of Dreams release, I skimmed it, but did not bother reading it. It was not worth my time. I think the great tragedy is that if Robert Jordan had back the years spent on this book, he might have come close to completing the series before he passed on."
1,"In a word, ""Zzzzzzzz.""","I believe in his ""about the author"" piece on the slipcovers of his novels Mr. Jordan indicates his intent to keep writing until they nail his coffin shut. So I assume that given the recent long-winded and incredibly slow books, he's just pacing himself. I must say that I hope he's able to finish the series before he checks out. For that matter, before I check out would be nice.Thus far I have purchased the hardback versions of all of Mr. Jordan's Wheel of Time books. However, after slogging through page after page of, well, nothing much at all in Crossroads of Twilight, I'm going to grab the next one--probably to be released a few decades from now--at the library. Heads up, Tor Books--I'm sure I'm not the only one."
5,Helen Hayes the great Miss Jane Marples,"I loved watching this movie ""Murder with Mirrors"" over and over....this tv movie of Agatha Christie was superb very enjoyable performances by great actors Helen Hayes, Bette Davis, Leo McKern, Frances De La Tour, John Mills, Dorothy Tutin, Liane Langand, James Coombes and John Laughlin. I enjoyed Frances performance as the housekeeper Mrs. Bellaver. The chemistry between Miss Marple (Helen Hayes) and Inspector (Leo Mckern) was superb as a comedy team guessing the manor house murders."
3,Not as spellbinding as the Joan Hickson version,"This is an entertaining performance for the Agatha Christie fan, with a taleneted lead and supporting cast that includes Helen Hayes, Bette Davis, and Tim Roth. I, however, recommend the BBC version of this film entitled They Do It With Mirrors, starring Joan Hickson as Miss Marple. The story is more tightly woven, with what I found to be more interesting characterizations of some of the lead characters, particularly Miss Marple's old friend and main character Carrie Louise. The drama and intensity of the plot holds me much closer in that version as well, as here Miss Marple seems portrayed as almost fragile and frightened of some of the events surrounding her. Still, this is a definite addition to the collection of any die-hard Christie fan."
4,Great Product,"This set is suitable for DIY's, because it has both sockets combined into one it is more convenient to carry, and it is designed for use with an impact wrench"
5,great set,"these are great quick change style, works great. i would get anouther set. very handy to have and they fit all lug nut sizes."
5,Common lugs!,"These are great! Common sizes. Who wants to fumble around with a bunch of sockets? These come with a convenient case to keep the ones you use the most, at your fingertips. Cant beat em for the price."
3,Very Early Riley,"I bow to no one as a Terry Riley admirer, but I find it hard to cotton to these 1960's pre-minimalist experiments in tape manipulation. Frankly, with the exception of The Gift, a brilliant collaboration with jazz trumpeter Chet Baker, it's thumbs down from me for this disc. If you're a Riley fanatic like I am, you'll want all his recordings, but if you're just getting to know him, I wouldn't start here."
4,The Power is Within You,"I am now reading this book for the third time. Every time I read it, I get something else from it. It is very uplifting. Louise Hay's words make you feel good about yourself. You feel more powerful in your own environment. I do not believe that people are Divine in any way, so I skip over that part. But the rest of the book is very useful. It always makes me smile inside to read it."
5,Another winner from Louise Hay,I just discovered that I can download audio books through my library's website and started with this book by one of my all-time favorite writers and lecturers. Listening to Louise discuss empowerment as it relates to every facet of life left me feeling euphoric and energized after each listening session. I will definitely listen to it again when I need a power boost. HIGHLY recommended. Thank you Louise!!
5,the power is within you,this is a life changing book and journey. very easy read. i couldnt put it down. i would definately recommend this book!
2,Just the same as You can heal your life and Life!,"I personally liked ""Life"" the most, because it's a book with many affirmations and extra info and ""You can heal you life"" has a more difficult way of telling and less affirmations, but it does has a guide with mental causes for your physical problems, so go to the library and copy the info you want out of it. As for this book it's just a rehash of the books I mentioned up above!"
3,A book with good intentions.,"Although the book has some interesting stories that the reader can relate to, this book also leads you into putting faith into another power i.e. God and the metaphysical, which is a little misleading from the title. By all means, I am not bashing this book. It seems that it can help a numerous amount of people, but the only thing this book gave me is a glimpse of empathy and the sense of not being alone in a situation. If you are the type of person who seeks harder or more logical reasoning, or if you are an athiest, this book may not help you too much. It may seem a little too whimsical to you. I was a little disappointed, yet overall a decent read."
1,Even more garbage from Asylum!,"Any minute now someone from Asylum is gonna post a glowing ""review"" of this garbage, don't be fooled. Friends don't let friends rent/buy bad movies. Asylum gives low budget a bad name! The only thing positive I could say about this *ahem* ""company"" is that they make the movie covers look good."
3,great movie for a sci fi,idk why people gave it only one star its no 5 vstar but its a good 3 star its very similar to i am legend
2,Not the worst from the Asylum,"The producers of this film, ""The Asylum"", have been making their mark in bringing slightly off cheapo versions of well known big-budget movies out concurrently on DVD. Having seen 2 other Asylum productions, ""Transmorphers"" and ""Universal Soldiers"" I was prepared for anything. Transmorphers was okay despite a lot of issues with its production values, while Universal Soldiers was quite horrible. ""I am Omega"" is the slickest of the 3 Asylum films I have seen to date. Its setting is really ideal for a low budget film like this as there aren't any expensive sets needed and the effects are all done for the most part with make-up and good old fashioned stuntwork. The sparse dialogue also suits the film well as it hides a great deal of bad acting. I have good news for this Asylum picture ""Not Terrible!"""
3,Not baf for a low budget knock-off,"Saw it in the bargain bin and since I am a zombie officiando, got it. Not bad for an extreemely low budget horror-show!"
1,Empty Promises,One of the headlight I got was defective. The seller called me and promised to send me a replacement after asking me to change my feedback with Amazon. But after waiting for a month I never got the replacement.
1,"Poor ,","I dont like , the effects on the cd are out , its a bad mixed , any song sound very bad , and the versions are hard and poorAlex Colvic"
4,Interesting read...check it out.,"This is a great little book filled with fun reading. Is it the most inspired stuff ever set to paper? No. But it's an interesting read. It sits on the coffee table at our cottage in WI, and just about every guest we have ends up with it in their hands. A mixed bag of lore, history, the occult, the macabre, and the just plain eerie. Is it just for entertainment, or is it a stab at non-fiction? Not sure. Somewhere in between I guess. But when the moonlight hits the water just right, and the summer night air is so still, it doesn't really matter. It makes for a lot of fun."
2,Flaccid and over-produced salsa romantica.,"Unlike Hector's three previous album this one's material is very lightweight and flaccid. Of course, it goes without saying that Hector is most definitely NOT Tito Rodriguez, Cheo Feliciano or Paquito Guzman (although his music is better than that of his contemporaries when he gets the right material- which obviously did not happen here). ""Ella No Esta Marcada"" is the only good song on this album."
5,Brilliant Children series - so funny!,"Pahappahooey Island is an excellent story about Ali and her friends trying to rescue their island. I like the future episodes better though because the characters are more defined and work better together. The stories are insightful and help children learn more about themselves and how God wants us to treat each other. Good for their development of good self esteem! I really reccommend this. I just wish you could get the other episodes like 'Super Millard' etc., on video as well - DVD would be nice! I would buy these in a flash!"
5,Love tribute,"Joseph Gustafson has moulded the pain of the loss of his father into a powerful, evocative tribute to the love that bound them, discovered only during the process of his father's death. If you can, read this book while your father is still present on the planet to hear of your love for him. If your father has already crossed over, this book will bring comfort and inspiration to your soul."
5,"Henry Cooper, Bluesman for the Millenium",Henry Cooper surpasses his excellent first album (Baby Please) with Slide Man. Mr. Cooper once again demonstrates why he is the quintessential blues craftsman of our generation. His passion for his material is only exceeded by his skill with his guitar. This album is the rare opportunity to enjoy the blossoming talents of a person who is soon to be a major star.
2,Special effect,"Ken Ishii has this special effect on me: he makes me nervous! I like one track, missing melody, where all the funky chaos seems to fall in place. On the other tracks it just doesn't. You want sthng extra: buy EXTRA."
5,Gold Wing Oil Filtrr,Great little Filter that I have used since own my bike. I highly recommend this filter. Seems to do the trick.
5,Gold Wing oil Filters,I buy these for the nut welded to the top of the filter. It's the same size as the oil drain plug and really simplifies the oil change process.
1,K&N Oil Filter fits all Oil Head BMWs,"Purchased two K&N filters for R1100S. Filters were advertised as fitting all oil head BMW motorcycles. Filter gasket not same diameter as original part however, could not use. Filters were returned, cost for filters refunded but cost of shipping was not refunded, despite what would seem to be false advertising by seller."
1,filter,"filter is okay only torque spec, i have no room for a socket. amazon said free shipping over 25 my filters came to 25.18. they charged for shipping. i went to ebay."
5,Excellent Oil Filter.,"These K&N oil filters are high quality filters with the benefit of the nut on the bottom. On some vehicles with limited room around the oil filter, the nut on the bottom is priceless."
5,Great part,I have used multiple filters on my bike. This filter filters the oil the best and is the easiest to change thanks to the attached hex head. Also it is ideal for track use with the drilled hole.
4,"The ""Art of War"" for office politics","These 300 maxims by the disobedient Jesuit of the 17th century are practical rules to live by if you would succeed in human society. While not rising (or sinking) to the level of Machiavellian, it must be stated that pragmatism is the guiding light behind this guide to advancement in life. It's not strictly immoral, and indeed Gracian urges the cultivation of virtue, but it also recognizes the fact that one's success depends on the approbation of a fickle, superficial and jealous humanity which sometimes has to be treated with guile, cunning and artifice when flattery, style and native talent just won't cut it. While the idealist might shrink from the book's subject matter, the realist will smile at its insightfulness."
4,Balthasar Had It Going On!,Did you walk to work or carry your lunch?Buy It!4 stars because I wish it was much longer and more detailed.
2,Overrated. Waste of time.,I consider this book to be an overrated waste of time.Better to spend your time on other authors which will better improve your wisdom and quality of life.
5,A Guide to Living a Successful Life,"I have read this book many many times, and have given a copy of it to each of my adult children. It contains common sense wisdom to help one deal with almost anything that comes along. If I would have only had read it when I was in my twenties, how much easier life would have been.However, I have no complaints. I am happy to have found it when I did, and life is so much better now. This Jesuit Priest (the author) had insights in the 17th Century that apply to virtually everything in today's modern world. With the exception of the Bible, this book contains more wisdom than anything I have ever read."
5,Divine stuff about earthly matters !,"Many personal insights and borrowed nuggets of wisdom come back in alienated majesty through this book. By far, more deep than many in its genre and definitely more wide in treatment than most."
4,Interesting Book,"I heard about this book from an online newsletter. Some of it is very interesting, but the translation into English leaves something to be desired. Some of it is very obscure and difficult to understand. After awhile I found it to be repetitive and it got a bit boring."
5,Cool thermometer,We are very pleased with this thermometer. It looks great out by our deck. It's a substantial size and the worn look is just what we wanted!
4,Unique & Creative leadership teaching,"This book is a breath of fresh air for leadership teaching. I especially liked the ""playbook"" sections of the book. These sections are real ministry illustrated strategies that were played out by Northpoint church. I like it when church leaders share their failures as well as their successes. The book is open and honest."
5,A book every minister should read,"I have been amiss in not writing a review of this book. It is a great little book on effective ministry. His ideas of seeking the win are great. Everyone wants to be on the winning team, and churches need to define what a win is. Also, his stuff on reviewing ministry is important. So many congregations do the work every year, but some of the programs are dead, but no one will stop them. His thoughts on narrowing the focus are wonderful. Many churches have followed the mega church model of program after program, that even Bill Hybels admits is not effective in transformation. Then finally his thoughts on listening to outsiders is needed. Most times we ask members how to grow, but really most members do not have a clue. We need to ask those who are not coming, they know why they are not there. This is a great book."
3,Nice book. Lacks Biblical Substance,"I liked this book. I read it within a few days. It is a really quick read. It has some great points. However, what it lacks is sricptural reference. This book describes 7 habits for an effective 501(c)3 organization. It parralels itself with ""ministry"".I think this book can be very helpful to today's church leaders. However, as with much of today's ""church"" literature, I suggest that you read it side my side with your Bible. Make sure that you are not compromising the Word or God's divine assignment for your ministry in order to line up with the practices and examples in this book.Overall, I think that a ""mature"" leader will be able to pull some ideas from this book that will definately help their ministry."
5,Great Leadership Resource,"This book was and continues to be a great resource for our entire church leadership team. It has been very helpful in defining our ""wins,"" and helping us to stay on task."
5,Great for ministry planning.,This book can and will change the way you do ministry. It is practical and helps you to sift through the current ministries you have and gives you a mandate for change.
5,"Great Book, Great Purchase","Book purchases have two parts: the purchase and the quality of the book. The purchase was clean and neat. I appreciate how Amazon has continued to streamline the purchasing process and the arrival was on time.Andy Stanley's 7 Practices of Effective Ministry is a great book and a must read for staff and volunteers of local churches. If this had been available years ago, it would have helped me in training other staff. I was accused of trying to make church like business when I simply was using Bible based principles that work. Great book. Great purchase."
5,love this book,"I have used the practices described in this book to re-focus our denomination's youth ministry board. It is a very easy read for anyone, even guys who won't normally read a book. The key is not just reading it but analyzing your ministry and asking the hard questions and making the tough decisions. I would recommend this book to anyone who is struggling to find their ministry's focus and vision."
2,Last Days of Dolwyn,"I purchased a VHS tape of the movie listed. Granted that it is an old British movie, and I was prepared for something less than a perfect copy. However the tape I received is a poor copy, obviously copied from another tape and who knows how many generations from an ""original"". The sound is atrocious, with a loud hiss and buzz and it should not have been sold in that condition. I would like to return it if I can; please advise how I can do this."
4,good drama,I just recieved crossings. I did enjoy watching it. I was however a little dissapointing. They left out Le anns children. It was some time ago I read the book. I do not remember Le anns husbands son at all. He did add to the plot of the movie. The love story is typical Daniel Steele. It was worth the money. I do so enjoy my non usa format player. All in all it is a good movie.
5,It's OK to be regal!,"Although SOME folks will never understand it (bless their hearts!), this book is an absolute jewel and a wonderful revelation that we are ALL special women. Why should beauty pageant winners and homecoming queens be the only ones who get to wear a tiara and wave the ""queenly wave""? I believe the author sums it up pretty well when she states that life is waaaaay too short for us to waste it by being unhappy and unsatisfied. To that end, why not stick a crown on your head if it makes you feel better? It's a heckofa whole lot cheaper than seeing a shrink, and you'll have the pleasure of meeting a huge sisterhood of women full of heart, stamina and yes, humor. It makes me proud to be numbered among them."
4,"I hate sweet potatoes, but I loved this book",Ms. Browne infuses her book with a healthy blend of Southern wit and feminine intuition. A book that can be enjoyed by men and women alike. Long live the Queens!
5,What fun!!!!!,"We have a ""Book Club"" of sorority sister (class of '76) whe reads a book together. This is our current read-we're all having a blast with it!!! We do a fall get together-(we're scattered all over the country) And this year is in Fl for the Miss America Pageant(watch on TV) Prior to the pageant we plkan on going out to dinner wearing our Tiaras, Elbow length gloves & Sashes. What great ideas have been stirred up since we sarted this book."
5,laugh-out-loud funny!!!!,Beach reading at its finest! hilarity (often explained)beyond words...the PROMISE alone is worth the purchase!!!!
5,Laugh Out Loud Until the Tears Ruin Your Mascara Funny!,"Gather some girl friends and read chatper of this book out loud, preferably with some of Fat Mama's Margaritas and ""Oh Gawd"" Pie. (Recipes included) Bawdy, vulgar, trashy, hilarious, outrageous and wonderful. Advice on love, sex, men, being prepared, being audacious, being yourself, or the self you were meant to be. Then buy extra copies for those girls who couldn't make the party!"
5,"Why, bless your heart!","That's all I can say to the poor misguided person from Phoenix who obviously doesn't *get* the whole queen thing. Y'all, this is without a doubt the most fun book imaginable. I am a queen, and proudly wear my tiara. I share the joy of play that Jill Connor Browne encourages, and have met an entire court of strong, playful, confident women that understand. Buy the books, buy a tiara, get some majorette boots, and make your reservations for the parade in Jackson next March. Otherwise, sit on the sidelines as a world of fun passes you by. You will LOVE this book...I promise! ; ) HRH Viv"
3,Not really my style,"Though entertaining in parts this is not my favorite reading. I read it on recommendation of a friend. Though very funny at times, it got old. I am not saying don't buy it but make sure it is your type reading."
2,Book of no- so-much love,"I loved the first novel in this series. The joie de vivre of the protagonist was catching. However, I felt that the Book of Love was just a rehashing of the principles of Sweet Potatohood and, while somewhat engaging, no meaty enough for me to continue reading it to the end."
5,Ya Ya Wannabes? Be Something Better!,"If you haven't sat down to read some good Southern advice in a while, pick up a copy of The Sweet Potato Queens' Book of Love. As the subtitle states, this is a fallen Southern Belle's look at love, life, men, marriage and being prepared. If you enjoyed the Ya Ya Sisterhood, you'll love this real life look at how to be a Ya Ya or even something better! I absolutely howled with laughter (something NOT acceptable to the Sweet Potato Queens) when I read about the ""magic words"" that will make any man do your biding. While it might be hard to force yourself to say the words they suggest the first time, I can assure you, from personal experience, that it does work. And, as they say, follow through on the promises made are not necessary. Curious about the magic words? Pick up a copy of the book. I promise you, all you Sweet Potato Wannabees, that you'll love it. Just remember to laugh in a pleasant manner."
5,A Must Read for Every Southern Woman,"I picked this book up on an evening when my husband was out of town, and I'm so glad I did. It was one of the funniest books that I have ever had the pleasure of reading. I literally laughed out loud during much of the book. Being from Mississippi and having lived in Jackson, I already knew of the Sweet Potato Queen's, but this ""insider's"" book was so hilarious. Every southern woman who reads this book will know at least 3 of the Tammy's and will want to become one herself. Enjoy!"
2,Sweet Potato Queens Book of Love,"I picked this book for my bookclub based solely upon the glowing reviews on this site. I was the only one to finish the book - and I only did so because I felt obligated to. This book is just too silly and over - the - top. I got the impression that this book is working too hard to shock you - it's too in your face, trying too hard to impress you with its antics. There is a message to be found in the book - a ""moral of the story"" if you will, but I'm not sure it is worth the effort."
2,I agree with the other Ya-Ya Devotees,"As a transplanted southerner, I am always eager to read anything that will give me insight into the ""southern"" rules of life. But I, like the other Ya-Ya devotees, found this book lacking in some areas. I wanted to care more about the Tammy's and the whole ""institution of Sweet Potato-ism"" but it in no way held my interest as much as Rebecca Wells did with her Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood. I suggest you read this first, and then you will appreciate the Ya-Ya's so much more. The reverse will only cause more disappointment."
3,Book of Love,"I'd like to agree with the reviewer who said it's a little much. I realize this book is extremely popular, but I just got a little bored. The best comedy is written by Bruce Cameron, Dave Barry, and Cathryn Michon. For a hearty laugh, check out one of those authors."
2,Definitely Not The YaYas!,"5 stars! Please, do tell me what you people see in this book. I was generous in giving it 2 stars (it did make me smile a few times). In my opinion it is poorly written and just simply silly. The Queens have a good time no doubt, I'll give them credit for that, but they are trying too hard to be ""all that"" when they are clearly not. If y'all won't a good southern read, be sure to pick up a copy of Rebecca Wells ""Little Alters Everywhere"" and ""Devine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood"".Just my humble opinion... Contessa of Stressa ~ Duchess of Design Crawbaby of the Royal Order of Devine YaYas"
1,No. I didn't like it,I would not recommend this to anyone.Tacky. Low class. Trashy. Raw.I don't get why anyone would want to be a Queen-wantta-be. Sick.
5,Sweet Potato Queens book of Love.,Great story! Made me laugh out loud at several spots. Really an enjoyable book and I will be reading more of the series. Good read for all women!
4,very funny--just what one needs occasionally,"Although the book was not ""great literature,"" it was really funny and worth reading, if you have a sense of humor. Some may not ""get it.""As a middleaged woman, having the time of her life, I know just how Miss Browne felt in all those situations."
5,Female Lewis Grizzard but even funnier,"This one of the funniest (if not THE funniest) books I have read. Most of the time we take life much too seriously - THE queen reminds us to actually live. Please, please read it and throw away the Prozac."
5,A hilarious account of southern women's views on life.,"A most enjoyable time spent with the Sweet Potato Queens and their many Wannabes. You'll laugh yourself unconscious at their many antics and their advice on how to deal with men (good and bad), children, weight gain/loss, etc. Once you start this book you won't want to put it down and when alas you have finished it -- you'll feel you've lost and now miss your best friend."
3,Disappointing...,"I have been meaning to read this book for years, because it sounded so funny. When I finally ordered a copy, I was a bit let down.I expected a funny take on being a southern woman, with a lot of teasing about being an improper southern belle (""fallen"").What I found was a lot of cliches and stereotyping---not of the female southerner, but more sitcom-style. The author relies heavily on traits that we females supposedly tend toward, but I don't find most of them to be true. I also don't see the behavior of the Queens as very funny--mostly snarky to their aquaintances, rude to outsiders, condescending to men, and uncreative. I also don't get the heavy reliance on sexual jokes and innuendo. My friends and I don't talk like that, yet we are not prudes.It would be funny if the author didn't appear to belive in her own dogma, but she says she does, so I guess I'll have to take her at her word. No matter, I've got this one up for swap and won't finish it."
2,dissappointed,"I had high hopes for this book having read Rebecca Well's novels, but was sadly dissappointed. Her humor is forced and over the top, and the actual style of her writing is pathetic. Some people may enjoy her ""feel good about yourself by listening to me feel good about myself"" attitude, but for a truly uplifting and moving story, try any of Rebecca Well's novels."
5,What a laugh!,"I made the mistake of reading this book when I was waiting for my car to be fixed. I was waiting in the lounge with about 4 other people, all of whom will undoubtedly be telling people at dinner tonight about the Very Strange Lady who was laughing so hard she was crying!That was okay, but the hard part was when the service manager came to talk to me about my car and I'm wiping tears from my eyes as I was reading the pregnant lady underwear section!This was a really funny book. I've read other books and been irritated by the 'ism's of a region, but this one is just about women who make no excuses and enjoy being women. In an age where everyone works very hard to be what they aren't, this book just enjoys the hell out of being a girl."
3,Sometimes too much is too much,"I am going against the popular opinion with my review of this book. I know it is not a book you would want your mamma see you read (she's barely recovered from me getting suspended for ""Valley of the Dolls"" in 1973). This celebration of southern womanhood is indeed a full of laughs. I mean tears running down your cheeks, snorting at your desk at work laughs. Beware,it will be grabbed out of your hands because you cannot breathe enough to tell your co-workers what has set off this laughing.....if you can actually repeat the phrase or story that triggered the laughing fit. There lies my dilemma. It is full of great humor, wonderful receipes and women you want to emulate. You will want to go buy your own tiara. It is full of the zest for life that we all want. I found that repeated vulgarity, even in this funny context was grating, and ultimately detracted from the book. Can I still keep my tiara?"
4,You DON'T Have to be born in the South,"to enjoy this little epistle. But you do have to know who you are and not be too full of yourself or take your role in life too seriously. We're all Queens at heart, some just repress it and can't admit it to their ever-so-valley-girl friends. It's about being yourself full time, not just when you're home alone with no one to see you eat that whole pineapple cake! Keep 'em coming, Jill!"
2,Disappointing,"I plunged into this book anticipating lots of laugh-out-loud fun but these moments turned out to be few and far between. Rather than finding a group of lovable southern belles, I found a group of loud-mouthed, vulgar trailer trash. Yes, it had its moments but not enough for me to bother with the next book in this series. Looking back, I guess I misinterpreted the reviews. My mistake."
1,Idiotic,"...I guess there are people out there you who like this type of book; books about oh-so-eccentric Southern women run around playing the part of aging Southern Belles, as if in this enlightened post-slavery, post-feminist era, it isn't downright idiotic or even offensive to behave like a such a shallow ninny. I am a woman from the Deep South (born and raised on the milk of magnolia blossoms) but if my close circle of friends and I met any of these women in person we'd find them instantly annoying.I'm not humorless, or a book snob -- I love ""wasting"" an afternoon reading something completely frivolous and unnecessary, but this poorly-written book was just a true waste of time."
1,"""ya ya"" copy cat tries too hard and misses","What a dissappointment this book was! Did some editor just hand over the ya ya books and say:try to write like this"" ? The humor is contrived and the story never takes off."
1,horrible,"As I read this book, I wondered ""why would i take advice from this woman?"" ...and that is the same thought on which I ended the book. It was distasteful, laced with cuss words, and not even well written. A definite waste of my $6."
3,Whats up with Amazon,"Although this book is great, why would Amazon sell a book that is only 3 inches by 3 inches!!! I have bought this book before and loved it but had given it away and was in the market to get a new copy. I thought this was a used copy but when I received the book it was a tiny little minature,not the normal sized paperback. Sorry to be dense, but I think the description should have been a bit more detailed."
4,For all the queens out there!,"My mom read this book first and then lent it to me to read. When I finally got around to it, I regretted having not picked it up sooner. The book is a riot! As a Southern girl who loves to read about Southern women, I would recommend this book to any woman, anywhere who wants a laugh-out-loud book full of advice. For the queen in all of us, this book is a funny tribute to women everywhere."
5,Wannabe!,"My mother read this in her book club and kept raving about it. I finally borrowed it to read on a road trip from Houston to Huntsville (not a long trip). I could not stop laughing! This is a fantastic book! I'm 26 and am now a die-hard wannabe. I recommend this book and the other SPQ books to any WOMAN who wants a good laugh. For those who have complained about it not being serious literature - hey, what did you expect?"
3,"Mmmmm, it was OK I guess","Maybe I don't get it. I'm from the south and know women like this I guess, but after the first 20 pages of this book, I stopped smiling and it got old....fast. I'm sure you have to ""be there"" to appreciate it."
5,QUEENS FOREVER,"Sweet Potato Queens, Book of Love is WONDERFUL! I could not put the book down. Once I finished the book, I missed the clever queens, so I had to order the next version, God Save the Sweet Potato Queens. If you are looking for BIG laughs..this is it!"
5,South's best kept Secret!,"Girls, Girlfriends, womenfolk, hear me now: This is a delightful, irreverant book for women only...ok, perhaps for a few thick-skinned men too, but they'll never be the same after readin' it!. It is so funny, so honest, you must read it. It is so Southern too! I'm talking, laugh out loud, laugh out loud, laugh out loud!"
3,Better than Laughing Gas,"Friends keep a woman sane, but friends this funny make a woman insane! This book was so funny, people thought I'd cracked up laughing to myself while reading it. Had to leave my bedroom one night, 'cause I was reading it in bed, and got to laughing so hard I was afraid I'd wake up my husband, and Lord knows, you couldn't explain this book to a husband. I want to be a Wannabee, just to hang around this group."
3,Too True,"Okay, so its not great literature, but its a great read and funny in an honest way -- though buyers beware, this is definitely a ""chick book"". Strong women who are proud of their beauty and honor their friendships with women will find much truth here. Need an example? How about Real women keep the girl scout motto -- be prepared. I.e., always shave your legs because you never know who might show up."
5,I laughed so hard my face hurt,"I read this book in one sitting, I couldn't put it down. I have never laughed so hard or so much while reading a book. These self proclaimed Queens are most definetly Queenly.This one is a must read, especially if your from the South. I think this book would be a great gift idea. I can't wait to try out some of those recipies and of course I must try some of the other advice and tips noted. I wonder how well they work for us regular folks, maybe you have to be a Queen to pull them off."
4,The King Gives The Queens A Big Ace,"Totally irreverent, but I would have to guess that it is one of those true-to-life memoirs / handbooks. I laughed all the way through it and then it hit me and hit home...these ladies are just like most of us, except they say what we might think in our secret recesses and they live it to the hilt. Makes me want to head South for the next parade."
1,What the Heck,Really? What a waste of good money. It was recommended by my book club. In my humble opinion it is demeaning to women.
1,"Damn it, where's my ice cream?","When I started this book I was ready to have a good time. I was looking for a light, easy read with a high entertainment factor for the weekend, however, it never happened. After a slow start I tried to keep the faith, but by page 65 my faith dwindled down to nothing. This book was always on the verge of being funny, but never crossed the threshold. I thought with chapter titles like: Men Who May Need Killing, Quite Frankly or What to Eat When Tragedy Strikes, I was in for treat, but I never was satisfied. I wanted an ice cream sundae, but all I got was the bowl!"
4,For girls only,"Great ""book club"" read. Receipes great!...Have fun with it as intended. Our club made it a ""dinner"" and discussionand had a ball with it."
5,It could be a cult,You have not lived until you've had Absolute Fredo martinis and that chocolate stuff. I also recieved a pocket ham for Christmas.
4,A hilarious how-to,"What a gloriously funny book! Even the recipies were funny, and well, how funny did you think a recipie could be?! I ""discovered"" this book en route to Jamaica back in May--the stranger next to me read it all the way there. Well, the cover just grabbed me and I HAD to have it. It was a quick, light read that had a very wise and uplifting last chapter. Oh, and for those who are clueless like me in the beginning, this is not a fiction novel, but a wacky manual about life, love and other good stuff that we should all follow to the hilt!"
5,Southern women at their most hilarious!,"OMG, this is one of the funniest books I have ever read! As a native Mississippian (who hasn't lived in Mississippi for almost 20 years), I know every one in this book, even if I haven't actually met them. I lived in Jackson, Mississippi during the time when the Sweet Potato Queens got their start there, and I felt like I was back there while reading the book.Jill Conner Browne has done an awesome job of describing the lives of southern women. It may not be politically correct (thank God!!!), but it is dead on.Long live the Sweet Potato Queens!"
5,"Ladies, the big three","Ladies, there are three books that you MUST read if you're interested in great storytelling, wonderful plots, Southern themes, and a great time: ""The Divine Secrets"" is the first, and many of you have already read this great literary achievement. The second is Jackson McCrae's ""The Bark of the Dogwood""--a haunting and intricate portrait of Southernisms gone horribly wrong. And the third is this spectacular read--""The Sweet Potato Queen's Book of Love."" These three, you simply can't do without. All are great, but by all means, buy and read TSPQBOL first! The humor, depth, sadness, insight, and wonderful writing of Browne makes this a great time. Why this book isn't better known is beyond me. Finding something this good, off the beaten path, makes me want to ask, ""Where has this writer been?"""
5,Ames Iowa GETS IT!,"Des Moines is not my fault!We are crazy about the Queens and plan to attend St. Patrick's day in Jackson, MS next year. This little book is a great big value. Pass it on."
1,Trying too hard,"This book is not that funny. True, there are a few clever ideas here, but for the most part, the author just seems to try and be over the top in her writing, with emphasis on the profane and disgusting. I don't find things funny just because they are profane and take away the disgusting elements of this book and you don't have much of a book. This book wasn't worth what I paid for it. I read it, although I'll admit not to the end. (I get bored when authors repeat themselves as this book tends to do.)I threw the book in the garbage and wished I had just checked it out of the library. Too bad, I understand Ms. Browne can write. She reportedly wrote some very clever and intelligently funny newspaper columns that appeared in the Jackson, Miss. newspaper."
1,What's that smell in Mississippi? ROTTEN POTATOES!!!,"I am a native a Jackson, Mississippi and adore the St. Paddy's Day Parade. I go home for it every year and have never paid attention to the Queens. They have always been a very insignificant detail of the parade. But, I saw the book in the store, and felt compelled to buy it. I was hoping for witty commentary on southern life, but was terribly dissapointed with Jill Conner Browne's lack of humor. I found it a dull read at best. The Sweet Potato Queens in no way compares to the exciting work of Rebecca Wells. Don't waste your time or money.... I returned my copy and got my money back. Your time would be better spent cleaning lint out of the dryer than reading this feeble attempt at southern humor."
3,"Cute, but dumb...","Parts of this book were funny, but on the whole, it was pretty mindless - and I'm from the South!"
1,Hatemhopetheydie!,"To quote the book. Funny in places, but once you are around the 'Queens' you know that AA has chapter just for them."
1,Boring,"I anticipated more of this book just from the reviews, but I guess I was wrong. I gave it a chance and kept reading thinking it would get better as it progresses but it didn't. i stopped halfway through when I realized that I'm only torturing my self, I could've read about quantum physics and it would've been more entertaining. I did not see the humor or the point of this book."
1,It had potential,I couldn't even force myself to laugh nor finish this book. What a waste of time. Save your money.
5,Funny! Funny! Funny!,"I could not stop laughing while reading this book and I giggle secretly every time I think of the words and techniques of The Sweet Potato Queens!!! I can't wait to get started on the sequel; God Save the Sweet Potato Queens!!!! Several of we readers have decided that we must make a road trip to the parade next year. I guess we will be ""Out of Pocket""!"
1,Not the target audience...,"I bought this book because of the rave reviews, but I am obviously not the author's target audience. I didn't get most of the humor and didn't find what I did get to be funny. There were a lot of what I would call ""southern living"" references that I just didn't understand and entirely too much dialogue about why the Queens are so great. I got about a third of the way through this book before I couldn't take any more and it is very rare for me not to finish a book.I wanted to throw this review out there to try to balance the raves for those of us who just don't get it. I would say that if you're a young (under 40), happily married, northern/city career woman, you might not fall into the target audience. If, even so, you really have to read this, I suggest checking it out from a library or borrowing it from a friend so that you're not sorry for spending the money on it later as I am."
3,Almost great,"There are a lot of interesting things in this book, but it is not laugh-out-loud funny. It is a great reminder that being a woman is fun and empowering."
5,Sweet Potato Queens Book of Love,"If you are not a middle-aged Southern woman, this book is not for you. But...there should be a law that every Southern woman must read this book! If I had read this book when I was younger, I would have made different choices in my life. Even at middle-age, it has enriched and changed my life in many ways. Everyone needs a little silliness in their life. We must take the opportunity to find humor in ourselves or we will lose our minds! I hope you enjoy this as much as I did. I WILL BE a regular at the Sweet Potato Queen festival from now on!"
5,Best Tool For Tight Spots,"We use this tool all the time installing stereos in cars. This tool is extremely versitile in getting into hard to reach or impossible situations. There are cheaper imitations on the market, but they do not hold up like this model, especially when used with a cordless screwdriver or drill. Add a set of hex shank drill bits to add to the versitility of this tool."
2,Necessary evil,"Although I've had need for this type of item on several occassions, I am disappointed with it's design and function. The grab bar is a separate unit and it keeps sliding off the head - right in the middle of trying to line up the head. Torque seems to be pretty good when you get it working, but it really is a pain to use."
1,"Cheaply made, un-reliable","Bought this tool 6 months ago, and have used it to drive in approximately 50-100 fasteners. That's about all they're good for, the input shaft fell out of mine, and there are parts rattling around inside. I've always heard good things about Milwaukee, and due to the compact design, i gave it a whirl even though it didn't feel well made. I believe that tools should last for years, and am willing to pay for quality tools. I'd try the larger one, but I don't think it will fit where I use this one, so I'll keep shopping for a replacement. If anyone has any suggestions, let me know."
4,Sturdy and practical,Very useful with lots of torque. Very glad my spa repairman introduced this product to me.
1,horrible,I tried 2 of these products and both of them failed within 5 minutes. The hex chuck is magnetic and can not withstand normal drilling. It broke both times. A very poorly engineered tool.
1,Average item.,The mechanism broke within 2 days with only minor use :( Can items be returned if defective? very unhappy with this purchase
3,The grab bar keeps falling off,"Since the grab bar keeps sliding off, I found this awkward to use. I purchased the higher end Milkwaukee 49-22-8510 right angle tool instead, and that one has a grab bar that is much more secure and practical to use. Although this one is smaller for the super right spots."
5,Best cd you will ever hear. Very true to heart and honest!,"Bill champlin is the most underrated musical genius of our time. His sensitive nature and bold vocals along with his honesty to do things the right way will keep his music alive forever! Too many people give into the ""suits"" way of doing things only for money. Mr. champlin sticks to his guns and refuses to give into this embellishment for personal achievement and money. From where I sit I see a man with guts, talent, integrity, and commitment to what he believes in along with the dedication and love he has for music , making it "" through it all"" and taking it to a better place! Rock on bill!"
3,Coming up a bit short,"While I enjoy Bill Champlin's voice and musical talent's this CD has left me wondering if this was done in three parts. First, to include his most recognizable songs (""Turn Your Love Around"", ""In The Heat Of The Night"") to some really excellent songs (""Proud Of Our Blindness"", ""Sound Of The Rain"",""Light Up The Candles"" and ""Must Have Been A Fool"") he has included the rest as typical filler material. Also, these songs sound very 80's-ish because instead of using real instruments, alot of samples and programming are used. Mr. Champlin has done this before and leaves this listener wishing for a full band (with horns) like he plays with in Chicago and The Sons Of Champlin. Take the sound out of the 80's and use real instrumentation, and add some more quality songs and this CD might be worth keeping."
3,mud flaps,"Kinda flimsy and wasn't sure I wanted to to put them on. After installing them, they look alright and keep the mud off my nerf running pipes."
3,Some extra drilling required,"Fast shipping, fit well on my frontier. But you need to be prepare to do some drillings and cutting on this product. Can't complain with the price that you get from this."
4,good protection,easy fit on rear. not good for front. need to be molded for proper fit on front. may be try on my van
1,MISREPRESENTED,"Although the mud guards were of sturdy construction, they were listed as fitting my Buck Century which they absolutely did not."
1,Was not what I expected.,The guards will not work on the 2005 Tacoma without modification. My husband will not attempt to install them. I guess we will be returning.
3,Not so sure,THese splash guards are made out of pretty thin plastic. I'm not really sure if the would hold up in cold weather. I didn't even bother to install them on my truck.
1,Never received item,"I ordered 2 of these over a month ago. Despite Amazon still listing this item as ""in stock"" they have not bothered to actually send the order to me. My account says ""not shipped yet, We'll notify you via e-mail when we have an estimated delivery date for this item."" After a month, and the fact that it is in stock, you might think Amazon would be able to figure that one out by now."
5,If You Dig Early Metallica BUY THIS NOW!!!,"If you liked Metallica back when they were doing songs like ""Whiplash"" then you have got to get this CD. ... this is cool!!!! The band should have been HUGE! But, that's OK. This is the kind of band where you can really show your espertise of metal. Not too many people know about this band---but once they hear it they always dig it!"
1,Motorola Q Fitted Leather Case,"This fitted leather case has a stiff back and cannot fit the Q with an extended battery. I ended up returning this product. If you have a Q with an extended battery, don't bother to order this leather case. They should state this feature in their product description."
1,"Movie, ""Drunks""","I love good recovery movies and nonrecovery movies as well. This movie doesn't fit either category; it was a waste of my money and good film. I labored through the first half of this movie and was actually hoping they would go get drunk or high again. If my first meeting had been like the meetings they attend, I'd still be drunk. What a bunch of whine babies. No recovery in this movie.P.S. The only reason I gave it one star is because my finger slipped on the keyboard. I give it a big fat zero."
3,TOO REALISTIC,"I happened upon this film by accident. It surrounds the circumstances of one night's Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. Richard Lewis falls off the proverbial wagon and goes on a drinking binge. Half of the movie follows him around the city trying to buy booze and get drunk because he managed to stay sober for two years for the sake of his wife... but when she dies, he finds no more reason to stay sober. The other half of the film focuses on the people who have remained at the AA meeting. Confessions are diverse and illustrate how anyone can be a drunk. Dianne Wiest, Faye Dunaway, Parker Posey, Calista Flockhart, Amanda Plummer, and many others make appearances here. I am not sure that I would say this movie is recommendable. It is interesting, but not something I would buy or consciously watch. It just happened to be on tv, so I indulged."
3,Drunks--Not so Much,"What originally interested me in seeing this film, was the original premise. Richard Lewis is an alcoholic in recovery who has undergone a lot of personal tragedy, and decides to pick up the bottle again. However, what this movie could have been did not quite pan out. While it certainly tries to portray the insidiousness of alcoholism, many other films do this more potency and accuracy. Furthermore, the AA meetings are more like group therapy and everybody is incorrigably depressed and immersed in their personal problems. The movie would have better served if it had provided some comic relief, lighthearted moments, OR hope to show contrast with Lewis' own inner darkness."
1,Bummer..........,"I really wanted this film to be GREAT, and it was not. No drama to keep you entertained, it dragged and although this could have been a really wonderful film to use for groups and those entering recovery, I was disapointed.The acting left a lot to be desired too."
3,It's not for everyone,"""Drunks"" takes place in an AA meeting in New York City. For those who are not in recovery, or are looking for an action flick, this is not it. The characters are interesting, including ""pre Ally"" Calista Flockhart. Richard Lewis is excellent as a recovering alcoholic in crisis. I have shown this film to patients in D&A treatment facilities and they seem to like it very much. It's an interesting movie, a little slow in places, but for anyone who's struggled with addiction it's worth a look."
5,An excellent introduction,"I have been practicing the Transcendental Meditation program since 1970. This is the classic book written by Maharishi. It is an excellent overview, but can not give instruction any more than you can learn a foreign language by reading a book. You must have an authorized teacher instruct you."
3,Too much heavy Mid Eastern influence instead of meditation practice,Not real happy with this book. Was expecting something different then a in depth history and tough to read explanations of TM
5,Truly Spectacular,"Science of Being and Art of Living is an fantastic add-on to my TM practice. The teachings held within these pages inform and expand upon the TM induction and practice. This book is great to read through, and also to dip in and out of to help anchor the TM practice through its thorough explanations of TM and its multiplicity of benefits."
1,Intelligent Jargon,"Read this book many years ago. Couldn't remember what was worthwhile so ordered for a current speed read. Explains the philosophy, etc., but reallly not worth the price or effort. Was looking for two books that dealt with the subject matter. The other must have been the one I was searching for. I'll keep looking..."
5,Spirituality,"I love it, this book is a great way to increase spirituality. It is great for this moment we are living."
2,Repackaged Hinduism for the Western Marketplace.,"This information is not new and it is arrogant to present it as such. The lunacy of spending thousands of dollars to learn age-old mantra meditation techniques can only be explained by the susceptibility of our society to clever marketing. This book is little more than a sales pitch. If you are interested in the message, get a book on mantra meditation, yoga sutras, or attend a local meditation group (usually free). A fool and his money, etc."
1,"Believe the reading, and eventually GIVE AWAY $300 minimum.","Yes, very entertaining. The correlation of the life of trees compared to your spirituality and quality of life, all wonderfully written. The only thing they forgot to leave out is the method on how to achieve the bliss we should all eventually experience through the practice of Transcendental Meditation. It's gonna cost ya chief."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED,My solaris broke after using it two times. The first time was to drill two holes in drywall. The second time was to clean out tile joints for grouting. I wouldn't recommend buying one.
5,A very detailed history of WWII aircraft and tactics.,This book shows many of the problems faced by those who served in the front air war during the second world war(1939-1945). It also talks about the hardships of gaining recognition to an airman for a gallant deed. A well written and historically correct book that is extremely interesting to read and enjoy
2,An American View,"The book, overall, is a good description of the tactics, battles and problems encountered and sometimes overcome in this wasteful and pointless war. John Elting weaves present day overview well with comtemporary accounts. The book does have an American bias, however. Canadians supporting the USA are given better press than Americans supporting Britain and Canadian/British Irregulars (particularly the Indian) are depicted as little better than rapists and murderers (American Irregulars are, of course upstanding heroes). I certainly found enough in the book to make it worth reading but would make sure a new reader had other sources to compare with. Some sweeping generalisations and two-dimensional characterisation spoil what would otherwise be a very good book."
2,"Great history? Oh, please!","IN my opinion, this book is no where near the great piece of scholarship as claimed by some on this site (why does this high school teacher named Kiley write two reviews? What is it with him and his hero worship of Elting?). It has some merits, but the scholarship is very slanted (typical Elting)and the biased conclusions by Elting rob the reader of the overall impact of what was going on (another Elting trait), especially along the Canadian border and Sir Isaac Brock's influence there."
2,A Primer on the Shih Tzu,"""Dr. Ackerman's Book of Shih Tzu"" is a good starting point. It has excellent photos illustrating dental hygiene, nail trimming, ear cleaning and paw trimming. This book gives good suggestions on choosing a puppy and the Shih Tzu's nutrition. If you are a beginner with this breed and just want an overall view, this would be a good book to start with."
4,i love this CD : ),"Who is chappie? no one knows for shure but she makes some fun music. the songs all have a wildly diffrent sond to them, especialy the cheerleading one. good stuff"
1,Terribly Researched Book,"Robert B. Edgerton's book is probably the worst book on the Amazons of Dahomey. Unsubstantiated (and wrong) accounts of lesbianism, ill-researched 'facts', and sweeping generalisations abound, not only of the women themselves, but of other African cultures, most notably the Kikuyu and the bride-price custom he writes about.Anyone seeking a concise history of these women warriors should see Stanley B. Alpern's 'Amazons of Black Sparta'. The Amazon reviews of Alpern's work point to the book's excellence and worth."
1,No smell,"My mother had me order this perfume for her, as her first bottle of the same was almost empty. This new bottle has no smell - it's like it's been watered down. If you spray it in the air, you can smell it for about 2 seconds and then it's gone. When she wears it, she nor anyone else can smell it - far unlike her first bottle. Her first bottle was made in Italy and this one in Germany - don't know why that would make a difference, but something is wrong with this perfume."
1,Beware of Homophobia,"I was delighted with this book until I hit page 43 and the section entitled ""Maternal Stress and Sexual Orientation."" I was both disgusted and offended to read the way Verny perpetuates homosexuality as abnormal. He is irresponsible and inflammatory in his words and implications. He basically states that a mother causes homosexuality in her children, that all gay men are effeminate and that lesbians are not nurturing females. On page 45 he writes, ""Scientists say the findings make sense..."" Scientists? What scientists? He uses this and rat studies to promote his spurious science. I was originally going to return this book to Amazon, but instead have decided to take it out of circulation and spend my money on a book that has some legitimacy."
3,pirate fun,this was a cute book nothing really outstanding. It is an easy fun read good for those times when you just want to have a giggle. I like Lynsay Sands sense of humor.
3,A humorous pirate romance,"Valoree had to masquerade as her murdered brother and scourge the oceans as Captain Red. However due to new circumstances she no longer had to remain in command of his pirate band in a quest to regain his birthright. She had been named heir to Ainsley Castle but before she could become the owner of her estate she had to get married because no executer would ever hand over the estate to an unmarried PIRATE. So now Valoree becomes desperate to get married to a nobleman and become preganant....Pirate romance with some funny moments. a sort of 'my fair lady' style where the uncouth, 'foul mouthed' pirate lady must be turned into a genteel ,soft spoken lady.For more serious pirate romances i would suggest 'the Madien's Revenge.' But this one is okay."
2,Not Up To Par!,"I have read several of Ms. Sands books and have enjoyed them. This is not one of her better books. It does have some humor but overall it was boring and a chore to finish reading. The intellectual level at which this book was written is not high. This was disappointing since it is a 2001 book. I thought a newer story would have more dept, etc. The sex was good. Over all, skip this one and read ""Sweet Revenge"", ""The Key"", and ""The Deed"" all by Ms. Sands and more intertaining than this one."
4,fun to the hilt,"I read this book on the strenght of a reccommendation from this site and I wanted to return the favour. It's not often that I laugh out loud at a romance novel, but this one was highly entertaining. I really enjoyed the characters and the romance aspect was more warm hearted than sappy. I sat down to read this book and didn't get up again until it was finished - if you're in the mood for a little fun and a few laughs then give ""Lady Pirate"" a try."
1,Use at your own risk,I've owned 3 Griffin Elevator stands for the last two year and have used them on a daily basis. I even brought it with me when traveling.Today five minutes after leaving my MacBook Pro on the stand I found it on the floor with some serious damage.If you don't want this thing to crash your laptop stay away from it.
2,Not stable,For the macbook air it's just not good at all. It's not stable and when you type it vibrates and the computer slips in it....
5,Great Laptop Stand!,I have used this laptop stand for about a year now and it has worked great! Very high quality and looks sexy with a MacBook Pro!
3,Shipping was slow..product ok,"The product will most likely be fine. However, I thought this company was very slow in processing my request. I ordered on Friday afternoon, and the product was not shipped until Tuesday. The product shipped from Tennessee and should have arrived to me in Georgia by Friday, however, it still has not arrived and it is two days before Christmas."
1,Great in theory but slips of the stand,Using it is great. It's elevated to the perfect height but my powerbook ended up on the floor in the middle of the night. Now my new hardwood floors are scratched and my powerbook and the battery for it are completely dented. I'm returning it the thingThey really do need to make a lip or use different grips or something.
4,Make sure you get and use clips!,"This stand is very good-looking and keeps my unibody Macbook cool, but after about nine months of daily use I walked in one day to find my computer had slid off the stand, across my keyboard, and down onto the floor. Washing the friction surfaces with warm water per the Griffin support article did not help much, but I contacted Griffin directly and they sent me a pair of plastic clips that keep my computer from sliding off. I don't know if they include the clips with the stand now, but if not make sure you get them!"
2,"Looks good, slippery","Just like everyone else, my laptop (unibody Macbook Pro) slips off the stand over the course of a few minutes to a few hours. To the point where I only have it on the stand when I'm sitting right next to it. Otherwise I take it off the stand and put it on the table.Basically a waste of money, I wouldn't buy this again or encourage others to buy it either."
5,A Great and actually usable item,I really love the Griffin Elevator. It does exactly what it is supposed to do. It lifts my 15 inch Apple MBP well off the desk. I have had it for about 3-4 weeks and I am really loving it!!
4,"Convenient Stand, but a Little Slippery","The stand is sleek and convenient, but I have had the laptop slide off a few times (I use a 17"" MacBook Pro). The key is to position the laptop on the stand with about an inch of the grippy pad on the top sticking out, so the weight is distributed onto the back of the stand more evenly. I definitely like the way the stand looks, but it is a bit pricey considering how simple a piece of ""equipment"" it is. Ask yourself if you wouldn't rather just stack up some books?"
3,Will unexpectedly fall apart,"I use this to (1) raise my computer to a more ergonomic level (top of screen should be just below straight ahead of your eyes), (2) keep my laptop from getting too hot, and (3) free up just a bit of desk space (not so useful for that, but it does help some). It travels well, too, more or less.However, do NOT pick this unit up and expect it to stay assembled; it WILL fall apart, and the significantly heavy arms WILL drop and may damage your property or person."
3,"Looks Good, Until Assembly","This was a beautiful product in the box, but the metal legs scratched the plastic base during assembly, leaving a few noticeable scars. Needless to say, it was a disappointing design flaw for me. Otherwise it would have been a five-star product."
3,Quirky Little Thing.,"I would not trust this to hold a laptop overnight due to potential slippage issues. I have cleaned mine repeatedly but it still has slight slippage. It comes in three pieces. On mine, one leg doesn't ft properly and falls out frequently. When the stars are aligned, it works as intended, but, overall, I think it is too quirky and overpriced for what you get."
2,Great until it slips off,"I left it alone twice today for less than a minute and I found my macbook on my computer chair (luckily not the floor). I've had this for quite a while and never had this problem. Perhaps like another reviewer said, the macbook has burnt off some of the rubber. Sad, because it's at a nice elevated height, but not at the expense of my macbook!"
1,useless cheesy mix,"I don't know what happened to Kimball, but this mix is about as lame as you can get. I was so ashamed I threw it out of my car window. Where did he go wrong? He did that AAHZ compilation and that was killer. Stick to the old classics Kimball, your new taste is very commercial. Don't waste your hard earned money on this junk."
4,Slammin',"this is a verry good CD, from one of the few good Dutch Hip Hop groups.. I Really Like The Mix between reggea and Hip Hop, Though this is more Reggea then hip hop..This Is A Must BUY"
3,some good tips,"I felt there were some good tips for designers here. I would not waste the money on hardcover. The format is similar to that of coffee table books. Oversized photos and little text (text is in English and Spanish)Nice to have for reference ,however."
2,A bit dissapointing,"I work as a flower designed specially with brides bouquets. It is a beautiful book with gorgeous photos, but the bouquets presented are mainly conventional. If you are looking for inspiration and new ideas on bouquets, I would not say this is the book for you."
3,Disappointed,"This is a coffee table book. It is gorgeous, but has very little in the way of instruction. I was looking for a how-to book for creating European style bouquets. There is almost no discussion of tools, supplies and technique. There is a short description of each gorgeous bouquet, but no details as to how it was created. It is a beautiful book but not very useful."
2,The ending was filled with holes and completely unsatisfying,"The book developed the mystery quite well. But when I read the epilogue, I thought some pages might have been torn out. Nothing was resolved, and the reader doesn't know what happened, why, or if it did. I reread the last chapter to see if I had missed things, but I didn't."
1,Worst Ending EVER!,"The book started out pretty good, but when I read that lame ending, I was really annoyed at the cop-out that it was. Choosing a new book is an investment of the reader's time and some trust is put into the author's ability to tell a good story. From START to FINISH. This ending turned this book into a tease. The author obviously had an editor deadline and rushed it. Maybe the editor finished it herself. Anybody can come up with the begining and middle of a mystery. It takes real talent and skill to satifactorally tie up all the loose ends and not leave the reader feeling like a sucker! I won't waste my time on this author again."
2,K is for Killer,"By far the worst of the Sue Grafton series to date. The ending of the book was rushed, as if the author decided she had 2 pages in which to finish this book, sensibly or not. No plausible motive was given, too many loose ends not tied up, and as one reviewer said earlier, Kinsey's relationship with Danielle is just not plausible. When at her best, Grafton is an amazing writer, her ability to set a scene with vivid descriptions a joy, but it just wasn't in evidence at the end of this book."
1,No Good No Good,"While I thoroughly enjoy the Kinsey Millhone series I was extremely disappointed with this book. The mystery was slow and low on suspense. I found myself skimming pages just to get to the end. The plot was thin and the wrap up was very, very weak with no explanation of the killer's motives. All around it was a big disappointment in an otherwise excellent series."
5,A real page-turner!,""" K"" was a real page-turner. I found myself having trouble putting it down. I figured out who the killer was put that didn't spoil the enjoyment of this book for me. It's true that this book was a darker turn for Kinset and Grafton but I liked it. It was a time for a change and IMO it gave Kinsey more depth. I don't think it was a sign that Grafton is bored I think she wanted to try something new. I agree though that it seemed to end too abruptly but I thought the ending was poetic."
3,Interesting but open-ended,This is my first time reading a book by this author. I enjoyed the book and will read another book by this author but I was disapointed in the ending. I felt that the ending was left with some loose ends and didn't give me a satisfactory understanding of the story or bring everything together. The basis of the story was a private investigator hired by the victim's mother to help track down the killer almost one year after the murder. The PI comes across a wealth of clues and there are multiple ties to other characters. It was a book that was easy to read but too open-ended.
4,a good as always!,"Ever since I got a chance to read the 'A' I just can't wait to read the next one and because of the easy writing-style, the books are also fun to read on holiday, even for the 3rd or 4rd time! This book is just as amusing and with just an unexpected ending like any other one!"
2,Grafton's classy writing saves the day.,"Sue Grafton knows how to put words together beautifully. Her trouble is that her complicated plots are often implausable and confusing to follow. Worse, is the number of characters that populate her books. In this one I counted 22 characters (and there were many more to come) by page 63. I kept turning back pages to sort out identities. .She needs a tougher editor."
5,Yay Kinsey!,"Who can not resist the luscious appeal of the California city nightlife? In this novel Kinsey is hired to investigate the murder of a mild-mannered water treatment employee by day and prostitute by night.Grafton paints a vivid and surprisingly exotic picture of the darker side of the night with plenty of sex scandals, drugs, and parties galore. It has an almost noir tone with all the classic baddies of a good old fashioned mystery."
4,I liked this Grafton book quite a bit...,"I liked this Grafton book quite a bit. I have only been reading her books for a year or two, because I'm only 12, but this is easyly one of my favories, because the story was so interesting, and, for once, her case gets her to feel something for some of the other people. And the charactures she creates are really interesting also. I would definetly recomend this book to ANYONE who likes mysterys, with a twist."
1,"K is for Komatose and yes, I mean you, dear reader!","This book was a huge disappointment. Sue Grafton and Kinsey meander all over California but come up with nothing of substance. The author spent more time describing the decor of a hospital room than explaining the murder motive. The characters and their actions are bogus and contrived. For example, Kinsey becomes emotionally attached to a young prostitute she met two days before. It doesn't work because it isn't real. It is Sue Grafton bending her characters into grotesque positions as she tries to force a plot into this dull mess. The story makes little sense as we try to follow the seemingly interminable clues and innumerable side characters. When it was all over, I still didn't know why the murders had been committed.Save your eyesight! Do not bother picking up this book."
1,Save your Money,"The negative comments here are all valid. I just finished reading this book and feel really let down, especially by the ending. Grafton knows her alphabet, and that's about all she knows. Be warned, it's not worth the effort."
5,a little help please,"I have methodically made my way from A through J and am just getting ready to order K,L, M and N=, but before I do, could I make a request of Ms Grafton for the next book. Please print a map of Santa Teresa. I keep getting twisted around and forget whether I am heading north, south ,east or west. She has given me enough directions to last a lifetime, but I still can;t find my way from her office to her cozy little remodeled garage apartment."
1,Terrible,"This is the first Grafton book I've read, but I'm pretty sure it will be my last. Simply put, this is the worst book I've read in the past year. The plot is ridiculous: it centers around the murder of woman who is prostitute/porn star/water treatment plant worker. The characters only exist as canned responses to the investigator's questions. Critical clue are revealed in predictable fashion to achieve an utterly anti-climactic ending devoid of any epiphanies or suspense."
4,Good Easy Read,I am trying to work my way through the entire alphabet. These books are great to read on airplanes and while commutingThey grab your interest and hold it.
3,A decent read - but what happened to the ending???,This is my first Grafton book in her series - It was an entertaining and easy read (although a few too many characters to keep straight) but it ended with me wondering if I had missed something! After following the entire story I wanted to know more. I thought there were a lot of loose ends......
3,A very interesting read....,"This is the first book I have read from the author Sue Grafton. I liked Kinsey Millhone,it amazed me how she got by on so little sleep,this lady seemed to enjoy her work alot. I thought the ending was a bit rushed,and I felt that the author should have added more. But otherwise the plot was interesting and kept me wanting to find out what was going to happen next. All and all a pretty good read."
3,not very griping,This is the second book of Sue Grafton's I have read. While i realize not every one can be as suspenceful as the other i was a bit disappointed. Without giving the book away the ending sort of left me feeling unfinished. Almost like i should have been looking for a second book. I found Kinsey Malone not as light-hearted in this one more like timid and bored with her life. Sometimes there was pages spent on trival matters and not enough on larger issues. But Sue still remains a common name in my book case this one just didnt hit the mark for me.
4,Sue Grafton at her best.,"I am a big fan of Sue Grafton's mystery novels. This is a book that was very hard to put down. The plot is very deep and unpredictable, it will keep you asking questions right through to the last few pages. As always, the witty Kinsey Millhone keeps you amused with her sarcasm and cleverness."
5,Lorna Keppler in 'K' IS FOR KILLER,"This was the very first of Sue Grafton's novels that I had listened to many years ago when I was on vacation in Maine. I had it on tape and thanks to AMAZON, I now have it on CD. It is one of my favorites since I have now read ALL the Kinsey Millhone mysteries OR have listened to them, including the new one ""U' IS FOR UNDERTOW. Thanks, AMAZON, for making it possible for me to hear the story again, this time on CD. I am sure my old tape of the story is falling apart.Dr. Alan Clarke-Hudson"
3,Feeling paralyzed,"Much to my surprise, Sue Grafton leaves the ending to ""K is for Killer"" open for questions. In the end, Kinsey is attacked with a stun gun that leaves her temporarily paralyzed. The reader tends to feel the same way when finding out that, as she has regained her mobility, the killer has ""left the building"" with the mobster-type crew introduced earlier in the novel and is never seen or heard from again. This is not your typical Sue Grafton ending, but the reader does get the sense that justice prevailed in the end. Overall the book was typical Sue Grafton style. Kinsey is up to ""old fashioned"" detective work trying to unwind the mystery of the death of Lorna Kepler. Lorna has many secrets in her life that Kinsey unravels. Her adventures do not seem to be too dramatic, but the job gets done, nonetheless. Good book overall."
3,What was that?,"It took a lot of talk and time to finally get the plot of this story going only to end with no answers. I wish I hadn't wasted my time on this one. Skip it, if you can. Hopefully, L has a good ending and we want Dietz back!!!"
1,Not one of Grafton's better efforts.,"I couldn't get through this. Stopped halfway through. Grafton's laundry-list style of description wherein she lists every item in a room when it has little to do with moving the story along is off-putting. Grafton's earlier efforts with this series were fresh and strong. Lately, she seems bored with Kinsey and it shows."
5,K is for Killer,"I have read most of the books with Kinsey Millhone, private detective. I like the way Sue Grafton describes things. I can visualize her descriptions of streets, people even the night sky."
4,Far Darker But Most Intriguing,"I'm gradually working my way through Sue Grafton's Alphabet murder series. This 11th entrant, K is for Killer, is one of her best and far superior to some of the others in the series. I'll keep the review brief since so many others have commented on the plot.This one is far darker than most of the other Kinsey Millhone mysteries, but in many ways one of the most intriguing and interesting. I differ with many others who criticized the ending in their reviews. I liked it. It was subtle (perhaps too subtle for some) but the killer gets his comeuppance in a way different from the normal justice system which often fails to deliver true justice. The only flaw I found in the book was that the motive for the killings was less than clear.After a couple of sub-par novels earlier in the series, Grafton is back in the saddle again delivering a truly enjoyable thriller and mystery. I will keep on reading the series. L is for Lawless is next.James A. AndersonAuthor, DEADLINE"
4,"Despite the hurried ending, I enjoyed this one","I am an off and on again reader of Sue Grafton's alphabet mysteries. Eventually, I will get around to reading them all, but it is not on my priority list of author's or series.That being said, I enjoyed this one. I thought the plot line led Kinsey to interesting people and places. As others have already noted, the ending is a bit forced. I understand why (Kinsey makes an ethical compromise that she would rather just gloss over) but it does not do much service to the reader.I give this one a B+ and I would say that this one makes me more likely rather than less likely to pick up another one in this series."
3,NOT AN ACURAT STORY,I KNOW ABOUT THE REAL WINCHESTER HOUSE. LOOKS A LOT DIFFERENT THAN THE ONE IN THIS STORY. I DIDN'T SEE THE ENDLESS PASSAGE WAYS AND MULTIPLE STAIRWAYS THAT WENT NOWHERE. COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH BETTER.
3,Decent pair of film's for a low price,Echo Bridge present's you withThe Haunting of the Winchester House:2 out of 5This movie isn't fun it rips off films like The Others and more films But VQ is great and the AQ is solid no extras damn i wanted extras for a film i didn't care forI-Am Omega:3 out of 5This film really bad but it's fun
4,Great Photo Frame,"I bought this as an xmas gift for my mom. So didn't need a top of the line digital photo frame, just one that my mom could use and view photos of her family. I thought the pictures looked great and were easy to download on to the frame. Mind you I'm not a professional or quasi-professional photo person, just an average user. But it suited my needs perfectly. Well, I actually ended up giving the frame to my sis-n-law because I thought it might be a bit too involved for my elderly mom who is not technologically savvy at all. I got a different frame for my mom that was simply plug it in, turn it on, and thats it. This frame had a remote and a fair amount of options for the pics. Oh, and my sis-n-law and family loved the frame. Definitely would recommend it."
5,Wonderful!,"I am quite a fan of Agatha Christie, and when I saw this movie on Ebay i quickly snatched it up. This was a great version of one of Dame Agatha's best books. Miss Marple (Helen Hayes) is sent to the Caribbean by her nephew who was worried about her health after an illness. Once there, Miss Marple becomes aquainted with an elderly general with a knack for story telling. One particular story envolved a murderer and a snapshot; when he goes to show M. Marple, he recognizes one of the people on the island as the same person in the photo. He is found dead soon after. Belief was that he died of a heart attack, but when a nosy maid is killed a few days later, the islanders realize that a killer is among them, and only wily Miss Marple can solve the mystery.I highly recommend this movie to any mystery lover.... Don't be put off by the fact that the movie was moved from the 50s to the 80s.... it truley is wonderful!"
1,"Waste of time, read something else","The author and publisher of this travesty need to spend a little more time in the real world, perhaps in the helping professions and less time in literati land where obviously they thought this tripe was a good idea. To those who believe this is an accurate commentary on American society, I say to look a little more closely; altruism abounds in our society, it just isn't as sexy or glamorous as the narcissism and the greed and so isn't as easly seen.Further a comment on the audio version of this book: the reader needs to stop trying to imitate regional accents. Speaking as someone who actually lives in Maine, very few of us actually talk with an accent and to hear it imitated (badly) in media is insulting."
5,Perfectly dark and consuming,I love this book. I've read it three times and I just bought another copy for a gift. It has everything I love in a novel. It's fantastically engrossing and the main character is so charming and bizarre. So many novels give away all the answers too early. These characters are as unpredictable as real people. The historical references are intriguing and cringe inducing. Every character has depth and motivation. You are equally fascinated and repulsed on every page. Each time I read it I am just as impressed by the writing and tantalized by the plot. I can't wait to read other books by this author.
1,"Weak, Pretentious, and Unresolved","This novel employs weak and/or untenable character motivation to carry a ridiculous plot that presents itself as a ""novel of ideas"" but is in reality a pastiche of solipsistic ramblings and cullings from secondary sources. As a novel of suspence, the narrative leaves loose ends and holes at nearly every turn, and the closure is so tepid I couldn't believe the diting could be so careless--one is led to think this ""plot"" is leading up to a climax, when instead what we get isn't even anticlimactic."
2,Disappointing,"The cover blurb made this book sound amazing; if only it were as complex and fulfilling as it sounded. The book is very dependent upon Katherine's character, yet she simply didn't mesh for me. She didn't come off as dangerous or interesting; she sounded more like any immature, impulsive, hard-drinking twenty-two-year-old. And the plot seemed bogged down in a ""Groundhog Day"" scenario, the same scene happening over and over. There were snippets here and there that showcased talented writing; I agree w/ the other reviewer that Sabina Murray seems more suited to short stories. Over all, the book seemed poorly edited, with no real cohesion or feeling that the plot was moving forward."
2,conversation piece,"this video is old and can bring up different choices one must make. not too bad to watch, but something more current in the 2000's."
3,ok,"the stamps are mounted on wood, and they are aprox. 1 inch square. the definitions are not on the stamps but are on a piece of paper included in the kit. the quality of the stamps and the red ink stamp pad are only so-so."
1,Questions/,I am very interested in this kit but have questions that I am sure others will have. Are the stamps mounted with wood? What size are the individual stamps. Are the definitions of the each stamp scripted on the stamp? Thank you for you answers. Tricia
1,Tacky play on words,"Perhaps a third grader might get a few yucks out of the sexual innuendo, but I find it hard to believe that anyone old enough to drive would find this amusing enough to put on the their car. Two thumbs down on this sticker."
5,See Yourself In This Book,"This book is for all of the ""self sufficient"" people out there who have conviced themselves that they do not need love, or anything that resembles it, in their lives. The longing for that chance of destiny to meet a special person who will make you feel just a little less alone, maybe even a little bit adored, is so wonderfully told and illustrated by Richard Torregrossa that you cannot help but wonder how he could see inside your heart and soul, for surely he must have wandered in there before he wrote this enchanting fable of hope and destiny. Buy this book, read it slowly, savor it, then read it again."
3,stick on spot clock,"if it wasn't called ""stick on"" I probably would not have a problem with its marketing, but it does not stick on, never did, so it should not be called that. The clock seems to work just fine, but it would be a whole lot better if it could stick to the dash."
1,Not visible,"I mounted this on my dashboard. I thought this clock would have a backlight for visibility at night, but I cannot see the time at all at night. Even during the day, it is not easy to read. The price was low but I'm sorry that I made this purchase."
4,Great for the car,I bought this as a Stocking Stuffer for my father when the clock in his car stopped working properly. My mom put it in the car and it works great.
3,It is a little clock that is hard to see,"It is small, unlit, and therefore difficult to see. However it fits in the required spaces of the dashboard and is attached by velcro which lets you pick it up, turn on the interior car light, and see the time. Okay for the price."
1,Do NOT buy this!,"Worked for about 12 hours. Now..... doesn't work at all. If you try to set it to the correct time, the numbers just keep jumping around, and not even in the correct order! Jumps from hour to minute and back again, all out of order. Just a little piece of junk. What a surprise."
3,Not as loud as expected,I was a little disappointed that the loudness is not what I was expecting after reading the product review. It's still a good whistle. I wish it had a lanyard.
3,Not a good hiking emergency whistle,"This whistle is not loud at all. I had much higher hopes. Its slim and compact, but its all about the volume. I do not believe you can catch someone's attention who is more than 40 yards away."
3,Sufficient but not the best,"I have used another product called Ultra Clarity by Nanofilm. I originally went in search for deals on that product or to see if I could find savings by buying in bulk. I couldn't find any such deals, so I went in search for something I hoped would work as well for less money. So I tried these. I can definitely say that the Zeiss cloths don't work as well as the Ultra Clarity. It does leave some spots and a little bit of a film. It's better than cloths I tried from Walgreens (1 star product), but not perfect and definitely not a 5 star product."
2,Still leaves a film on the lens,"I'm comparing these to the pre-packaged wipes I get from Lenscrafters in the mall and the Zeiss wipes are not as good. I have severe allergies in the springtime and find that the insides of my lenses get spotted with salt from all the blinking when my eyes get irritated. With the Zeiss wipe, I can get all the spots off, but it leaves a hazy film on the lens. With the Lenscrafters wipes, my lenses are completely transparent when I'm done (but they are expensive and require a trip to the mall). So, guess I'll have to keep looking for an alternative."
3,Evaporative residue.,"I've been usung these for a few months now. I originally reviewed this product after using the wipes for a week. It is so bad that I must review it again. It will remove oil and smudges, but it WILL leave behind a webbed film that can not be done away with. Other wipes out there clean perfectly, these don't. If Amazon would allow me to replace my 3 star review with one star, I would."
2,Not as good as expected,"Though carrying the big name Zeiss, I found that this product is not working as well as the one that we got from Walmart. This product cleaned off the dirty stuff, but then leave residues and streaks on the glasses, even for a surface that was initially clean. The one that we got from Walmart, however, when dried, leaves a clean surface. So I am really disappointed with this Zeiss product. The chemical they used will leave marking/streaks on the surface!"
2,Cloths leave a residue,"The Lens Cloths do a good job of cleaning, but they leave a residue behind. I even saw a residue when I cleaned my reading glasses, and I can easily see it on my camera lenses. A better solution for my camera is a fine cloth with no seams, and a lens cleaning solution."
2,Could be better,The wipes clean the lenses OK but leaves lines where the alcohol dries. Not the best wipes I have used.
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed with this product, because it leaves a lot of smearing/residue on the glass. I wouldn't even use this for my eyeglasses, much less for my expensive camera lens. The dry micro-fiber cloths, from Zeiss and other manufacturers, work much better."
1,Poor Product,"I purchased these for my glasses and my son's because they were inexpensive. After using them for appproximately two weeks, my glasses are badly scratched and so are my son's. His glasses are only two weeks old. I now will have to have our lenses replaced, even though the lenses in both pairs of glasses are scratch resistant. These inexpensive wipes have caused an expensive problem."
2,Too moist -- leave streaks on my glasses,"These wipes are so wet that they leave streaks on my lenses. They work well if you keep them around for a second wipe once they've dried out a bit. (I had better luck with the branded wipes from a local optical shop, See.)"
2,Streaky,These cloths always leave streaks on both pairs of my glasses. I wouldn't buy these cloths again.
5,Great tool! For Computers to Sunglasses,This is a great product. I have had dirt and prints on my computer screen that would not come off until I used these. The fact that the towels are wrapped individually keeps them sanitized and ready to go.
5,At Last: Something Easy to Use that Works!,"Ever since I started using reading glasses about 10 years ago, I've struggled with trying to keep them clean. I confess that I even resorted to trying to get my wife to do this nasty deed because she did a much better job than me.But she ended up getting the last laugh after she discovered this product in a local department store.The company I work for uses Zeiss equipment in its quality assurance department so when my wife brought home a product with the Zeiss logo on it I immediately became interested. I tried it and it worked! And it was easy to boot!Wipe it on, wipe it off. Any residue evaporates immediately, leaving your glasses sparkling clean. Great for sunglasses as well. I keep some at home, some at work, some in the car. I wouldn't want to be without it."
2,Leaves smears and splotches.,"This product does a decent job of cleaning your lenses, but is kind of useless on its own. No matter what I do, I have splotches and smears if I just use the pre-moistened cloth. I have to wipe with another cloth, like my shirt, after cleaning to get a clear lens."
2,A little too much work,"I bought these lens cloths because there were mixed reviews. I was hoping that perhaps my lenses were different and wouldn't experience the hazing / film issue. Well, I have multiple coatings on my lenses for anti scratch and UV and the like, and these lenses do leave a film on the lens. I found that if I use them on clear safety glasses with no coating, the lens dries streak free. If I use these on my eyeglasses though, I need to follow the wipe immediately with a tissue to dry them before the haze appears.Due to this issue, there's no way I would take these anywhere near my camera lenses. I have no idea if the haze would appear, but I'm not risking thousands of dollars of lens to a cheap wipe.Will I still use them? Yes. Until the 180 are all gone. Would I recommend them? No. They are only as convenient as sitting on my desk at work next to a box of tissues."
1,Leaves streaks,"No matter how well I wiped my lenses, it always dried with streaks and I had to use another cloth to finish the job (usually my shirt or a tissue!). I have used other brands and have not had this problem."
1,Not Happy,I have been very unhappy with this product because all the cloths are dried out when I open them. This should NOT be the case. My guess is that these Lens Cloths have been sitting around in the warehouse at the company for a very long time to dry out like this when they haven't even been opened.I will not be purchasing from this company (USA Wholesale Club) in the future. No wonder their cost was lower than their competitors.[...][...]
1,Zeiss should have followed up.,"A situation where Zeiss has licensed its name to maker ""Nice-Pak Products, Inc."" Zeiss has erred, as this stuff is worthless, leaving a lens worse off than it was before use. Pronounced smeared residue. I write this having tried enough packets, on a variety of lenses, to judge its quality. I'm a pro photographer and eyeglass wearer. Still like Kodak's liquid and tissues the best."
4,"Great, Safe Lens Cloth - Recommended","The ""Zeiss Lens Cloths"" are just about the best and most convenient lens cleaner I have found. We use very high grade digital still and video cameras in our business and trust these cleaners to get the lenses clean without removing the protective coatings.We also wear glasses and these also work great on them as well, leaving no streaking at all.Highly recommended!"
2,dried out in packages,"I don't think these are as good as Lens Crafters are, but are less expensive.The problem I have is that the last two times I bought them, most of them were mostly dried out upon opening the individual packages. That does not help the price be less expensive. If anyone has a web site for this company, I sure could use it to let them know that the company packaging their product is messing up. thanks"
1,very [vulgar] cd,unless your into really vulgar lyrics......dont buy this one.....it doesnt even have any good music to it.......actually the whole cd is ignorant.
5,Forget Los Van Van- This is GREAT CUBAN MUSIC!,"Hansel and Raul blend the old rhythms of Cuba with a Miami sound. It is a great party CD. Once you hear the infectious sounds of this super Miami band, you will not be able to sit down. Very highly recommended."
1,Unfulfilled promises,"The first chapters of the book are pretty basic and the experienced sailor will not learn much. The last chapters are more interesting: they explain what happens if you pull on a certain string, tigthen this sidestays, etc.The presentation and graphics are so low in quality that they seems to have been done on a computer from the mid 80's. It's also pretty obvious that there was no quality control on the text since long passages are sometimes repeated on the same page.At this price, you can buy books with color photographs, clear graphics and drawings on high quality paper. In its present format, this book is not worth more than $ 5."
3,Okay as a textbook...,"I had the opportunity to read this book for one of the courses in master's degree program. It starts off extremely slow! As you get a little further into the book, it becomes more palatable and more interesting. The author brings up some interesting points and did make me rethink my views as a teacher."
1,Defective watch,"Be very careful when you purchase this watch from Amazon,they could be a return or defective or without a warranty card.I have all the problems above when I got mine about two weeksago."
5,LIZ PHAIR IS JUST AWESOME,"IF YOU HAVEN'T GONE OUT AND BOUGHT EXILE - YOU HAVE TO. SHE TELLS THE TRUTH IN WAYS THAT MAKE IT EASY TO KNOW SHE IS THE SAME AS EVERYONE ELSE AND ALSO HAS PROBLEMS. ""I KNOW THAT I DON'T ALWAYS RELIZE HOW SLEAZY IT IS MESSING WITH THESE GUYS/ BUT SOMETHING ABOUT JUST BEING WITH YOU SLAPPED ME RIGHT IN THE FACE NEARLY BROKE ME IN TWO/ IT'S A MARK I'VE TAKEN HARD/AND I KNOW THAT IT WILL CARRY WITH ME FOR A LONG LONG TIME."" HOW AWESOME IS THAT? I LOVE LIZ."
5,A minor follow up.....,"Okay, so I came back to see how people have been reviewing Liz..I myself am still obsessive about this brilliant and completely incredible album after much time...but I feel sad for the people who've reviewed but can't appreciate this work. So maybe I am a white chick from the suburbs and maybe I love Liz and her music perhaps more than others but COME ON people show a little respect. I'd like to see you come down here and try it. LIZ IS AMAZING! If you haven't bought this...DO IT! YOU'LL ADORE IT. I did. Give it a chance, it'll become a part of you. Okay just had to throw in my two cents. Again. Sorry. :)"
5,Ground Zero Women's Rock,"Liz Phair's music is what others of the women's rock explosion of the 1990s' would only hope to produce. Liz is crude, loud, and is not going to take it anymore. ""Exile in Guyville"" is the women's rock album that should have been getting all the radio play that the likes of Sheryl Crow, Alanis M, and company got during the mid 90's.Exile in Guyville is an extemely well constructed rock album, with a gritty and very energetic feel at the beginning, moving from subject to subject, and ending with songs more along the lines of stream of conscienousness.I heartily recommend this album, but with one reservation. You don't want to be the faint of heart! Go Buy this album, you will not regret it."
5,why isn't liz phair more famous?,"I love this album. I first heard it at a coffee house and I was so hooked that I ran out to buy it (after I found out what album it was.) Liz Phair is an incredible artist. As a sometimes bitter young woman, I can relate to the lyrics about boys and sex and ... This album is so full - 18 songs! My roommate describes Liz Phair as ""another Tori"", but she is much more than that. But she does have the same sort of cult following and for good reason."
