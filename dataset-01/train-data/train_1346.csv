1,Deadly?,How can a toe nail fungus be deadly? Kill your chances to date? Kill your chances to be a foot model? Is this book a joke? The title certainly is!
5,Great volumn,"I have used this product for years and love it. My hair is fine and this gives me alot of ""humph""! I would recommend it to anyone who has fine hair. Love Paul Mitchell products!!!!!"
5,I HAVE HAIR!!!!!,"ok folks this product ROCKS!!...I combine it with Alterna Hemp Thickening Compound purchased on Amazon and a drop of PURE Hyaluronic acid (purchased on Amazon)and a tiny bit of Emu oil and Horaaaah!!I have discovered the magic elixir for thick hair that looks awesome and feels awesome!Interestingly noted, the Emu oil gives hair lift and I've' read other reviews about that as well.What it boils down too as I have never really had thick hair and I am Hypothyroid which thins/drys it out your hair badly...I feel attractive again!!!!Give it a try, but, I found that combining Thickafier and Alterna Hemp Thickening Compound together is the ticket!"
5,"My Hero Among Us - SSGT. Richard M. Coble, AUS","I always knew there was something special about ""Uncle Dick.""My fathers' younger brother was a true gentleman. I never heard a harsh word from him about anything or anybody, the whole time I knew him. He was devoutly religious and took church and Sunday school very seriously. Yet there was something I just couldn't put my finger on as a youngster growing up in our small Pennsylvania town, something that made ""Uncle Dick"" different from most of the other fathers of my school pals. This is a must read for anyone ""Searching for a hero."" Stories such as these, accounts of small town America's, sons and daughters experiences during WW II must be preserved for posterity.Sgt. 1st Class James D. CobleNephew of Sergeant ""Dick"" Coble"
2,"Assortment hmmm, screws/nails provided not great","Handy mixture of sizes and fastening tabs.. but the screws are too big and long for frames... what was the manufacturer thinking? 50+lbs artwork? Of the""32 piece (really 12 fasteners and all other are screws and tiny little nails) flat tabbed 4 pieces were usable. Had to use a needle nose plier to hold the tiny nails in place to hammer in pre-drilled photo frames."
2,Terrible quality,"I purchased this for my baby and immediately returned it. The quality is terrible, especially the nasal aspirator. It provides absolutely no suction whatsoever; in fact, the cap is so loose that it falls off if you turn it upsidedown. I wasn't impressed with the quality of the rest of pieces, either. It looks like the infant medicine syringe might work once or twice, but then quickly wear out, and the scissors don't look as though they can possibly cut anything."
5,Is a great laptop,"Is a great laptop, excellent size, clear sound, great performance, I'm very happy with this buy. Things that I might add: Less heavy."
1,Doesn't Work as Advertised!,"I saturated the offending Jasmine twice with this product. Absolutely nothing happened. I might as well have doused it with water. I tried it on some other weeds. It worked about the same as regular Round-Up - no better, no worse. Save your money. By the way, I purchased this spray in the container with the built-in pump. It didn't work very well. I had to pour it into another sprayer."
4,Genesis' first mega-hit,"Genesis' first mega-hit. The album spawned four hits and a few music videos. In MAMA,we hear Phil Collins' maniacal laugh(HA,HA,HA!!) THAT'S ALL and TAKING IT ALL TOO HARD were adult contemporary hits and ILLEGAL ALIEN is really cool. In that video,the band poses as Hispanics planning to immigrate to America. Take notice of the band in Mexican apparel. Live versions of MAMA and THAT'S ALL are heard on 1992's THE WAY WE WALK,VOLUME 1,THE SHORTS and HOME BY THE SEA and SECOND HOME BY THE SEA are heard combined into one track on 1993's VOLUME 2,THE LONGS. There's also a sample of ILLEGAL ALIEN on VOLUME 2's OLD MEDLEY. This album was produced by Hugh Padgham who produced albums for the band's fellow Britishers,The Police."
3,the 'ok' of the pop albums,"this is better than abacab and invisible touch, although not as good as the W&W and seconds out days. there are good tracks on this album and some long 'epic' feel tracks, but the end of the album ( silver rainbow, just a job to do, taking it all to hard ) are just pure boring, they all sound like the bad stuff from abacab.best tracks are thats all, mama and home by the sea."
2,The death of Genesis,"With Home by the Sea parts one and two, the last vestigial attachments to the glory days of their 70's art rock foundation were severed. These two track are a last gasps (good ones at that, however). All else that follows was unlistenable."
2,Should have been called Revelations,"as in Genesis to...Their last failing grasp at glory. Three passible songs (Mama, Second Home By The Sea, and Silver Rainbow) and one truly great tune (If It's Gonna Get Better). The sadly ironic truth is, it didn't.Buy anything prior to this release instead."
2,Phil Collins leads Genesis into MTV oblivion.,"Probably the weakest album in the entire Genesis catalog, this album is so lame that the band didn't even bother to give it a title. By this time, Phil was wearing a skinny tie, short cropped hair, and the band was desperately trying to fit into the New Wave '80s. And who can forget that pathetic MTV video for Illegal Alien? There is nothing memorable on this album. And it's hard to believe that these guys were actually the same musicians who participated in such masterpieces as Foxtrot and Selling England By The Pound."
3,Slowly declining,"Genesis(1983) is first fully pop/mainstream album and this one isn't as good as Abacab even though this is the first album in nine years where all the song are written by the entire band. With this album, Genesis is really straying from its roots of prog-rock. Signs of this include THAT'S ALL, JUST A JOB TO DO, SILVER RAINBOW, and IT'S GONNA GET BETTER(this song isn't bad though)and words can't really describe ILLEGAL ALIEN. Some of the better songs on here include MAMA, with its eerie keyboards, and HOME BY THE SEA/SECOND HOME BY THE SEA. This song is probably their best pop song and it still has some prog-rock elements in it. TAKE IT ALL TO HARD is another good one that sounds a lot like a song you would here off of one of Phil's solo albums. All in all, I guess this album isn't bad since the next album is worse."
2,"Please don't pay much attention to the stars, but my review","Genesis' self-titles album isn't necessarily the band at their best, but it still offers some great songs. Unusual to Genesis formula, this album didn't work well as an album as a whole. The band did not seem to connect with a good overlying theme to their 1983 effort, as the last three tracks, in significance, seem to wander off the record, making me wonder if this album should have been an EP. If anything, get it for Mama, a classic Genesis song and my favourite music video of all time."
5,"Wow, breathtaking! 3rd great pop work by Genesis!","There are a lot of great qualities on this one that makes it a truly classic of world pop music. One of them, by itself is the outstanding open track ""Mama"" that worths the whole album!!! Then it comes with the great ""That's All"", but that's not all! The two track piece ""Home By the Sea"" and ""Second Home by the Sea"" is just fantastic!! In every pop album from Genesis they always try to keep their old style and makes at least one long epic song. And from the pop era, this is simply wonderful! The album also have the pop gem ""Taking it all too Hard"" the dancing and explosive ""Just a job to Do"", the fantastic ""Silver Rainbow"". and the good ""It's Gonna Get Better"". Just ""Ilegal Alien"" is kinda medium song, but listenable. Great Genesis record, worth every cent!!"
4,Essential Genesis,"This is one of that albums that puts you up in a dark day. There's very good songs here, like the outstanding Mama one of the best of the album, That's All, a great and very nice tune Home By The Sea, and Second Home By The Sea, a very more prog pop approach, Illegal Alien, an OK song, Taking It All To Hard, a very nice pop tune, Just a Job To do, another good one, Silver Rainbow, a very beautiful tune, and the nice It's Gonna Get Better. It's one of the best album from pop Genesis, together with Invisible Touch! If you're new to Genesis, get one prog album (I recommend Foxtrot) and one from the pops (I recommend this one)."
2,It's gonna get better - how could it get worse?,"Well, it did get worse - Invisible Touch and Calling All Stations were conceived and released. The self-titled album starts off in solid form with the mysterious Mama, the bouncy pop of That's All, and the artsy drama and pyrotechnics of Home/2nd Home By The Sea. Then the ideas dry up, and the band has even said as much when discussing the ""rest"" of this album. Illegal Alien is an embarrassment. The remaining songs are filler at best. Silver Rainbow has an enjoyable driving riff, but those lyrics -ouch! Not the best effort from the Collins era Genesis, or should we say, Genesis Lite"
5,The zenith of Genesis's foray into improvised electronica,"From the moment I heard ""Mama"" I was sold on this album. Tony Banks, with dark analog sounds, and Phil Collins, with electronic percussion and vocals screamed just within the bounds of intonation, move this most beat-driven of Genesis works along. Except for the obnoxious ""Illegal Alien"" there aren't any clunkers to be found. I'm not sure why I find this album so appealing. It's certainly among the most musically lightweight of all Genesis albums. But maybe its steady beat, pandering melodic simplicity and gap-filled harmonies are what make it special. There are, after all, more than a few hints of the unique compositional style that brought us albums like A Trick of the Tail. Perhaps that is all that is needed to distinguish it."
4,Not the best...but close!,"This album is excellant, starting off with the hard rock ""Mama"" (though I preferred the ""Hits"" edition of this song), then going to its complete opposite---""That's All"", which shows that they can write good bad songs! ""Home by the Sea"" is simply awesome. It's the best song on this album by far. ""Illeagal Alein"" is excellant! It's very funny. ""Taking It All Too Hard"" is sweet and meant to be played with the rocking ""Just a Job To Do"". Then the second best song on the album---""Silver Rainbow"", and the good closer ""It's Gonna Get Better"". Buy it, but don't judge it by ""That's All""!"
4,Genesis at their near best,"This album is just a fine album to listen to. It has a little of everything. From the dark songs like Mama and Home by the sea to the more upbeat numbers such as Illegal Alien and Silver Rainbow, it creates a certain mood that leaves yourself asking for more. If every non-Genesis fan forced themselves to listen to this 2 or 3 times, I think they would start to like it."
1,Troubling Reviews Above,"""The lighter side of deportation?""...I guess the only thing more insensitive than the above-mentioned quote is the fact that a band of this stature and success had to pick on people in desperate circumstances. There are a few things to like about this album but with women of color depicted as prostitutes in the Mama video and accusations that an illegal alien would sell his own sister for work blots it all out for me. Listen to the Lamb or ""Supper's Ready"" from the Seconds Out live album - that's greatness. This is not."
2,The Usual Trio Garbage,With the exception of the interesting Mama and two prog rock numbers Home By The Sea and Second Home By The Sea Genesis is a terrible album.
1,Faceless,"It's amazing how quickly a band can change. Only a year after Abacab was released, Genesis lost its purpose. Never before had they released a song as stupid as Illegal Alien (""eets no fun being an illegal aileeon"") or as boring as Mama. The nondescript symbols on the cover say it all. 'Genesis' contain faceless music sung by the popular singer Phil Collins.Avoid.[DW]"
1,The biggest sell out in rock and roll history,"This is literally like Pink Floyd mutating into backstreet boys before your very eyes. If you are a phil collins fan of god awful pop whines help yourself. If you are a fan of the real Genesis i.e With Peter Gabriel and Steve Hackett buy 'Selling England by the pound' or 'Foxtrot' among others. When gabriel and Hackett left they should have changed their name because this album amongst their others couldnt be further to what genesis are/were really about. They have ruined their legacy as one of the most artistical, innovative and influential bands ever. They left their adoring cult fan base from the 70's abandoned, betrayed, bitter and disgusted. Why o why did Phil Collins ever stand in front of a microphone?"
1,The Real Genesis,"Does a Real Genesis Fan exist, Peter Gabriel established a new and unique sound along with a good fan base. Phil Collins took Genesis and made them an AM hit. A true Genesis fan will stick with ""Selling...."" before any of the Genesis II stockade. I miss the true Genesis sound, avoid the stockade unless Your just ""another"" Phil Collins groupie, his songs have no Story, just the same lyrics over and over. This album is a prime example, how many times can You say ""Home by the sea"" before it becomes repititous. This is the Phil Collins Band, not Genesis."
2,A review of a 24 years old album,"I was once a huge Genesis fan, of course, I know the Gabriel era, which produce creative albums. Then the band took a strong turn and became a pop band. Even with this turn, I still appreciate their music. To me, it is two bands, maybe they should have change their name at the same time they changed their musical style. I have seen them in concert for this tour, I know the album since it went on the market. Twenty three years later, I have to admit that I only still like three songs out of nine, hence the low rating. The album is not bad, but the only one I want to hear again are Home by the sea-Second home by the sea and It's gonna get better. We have heard too much Mama and That's all. Illegal Alien is not the kind of piece Genesis is supposed to be limited to, they can do a lot better than this. The rest is so-so...."
5,My Genesis CD/DVD,"This is my favorite disc, and until now I wasn't be able to buy it in any store. This is great."
3,Genesis sells out!,"As a huge Genesis fan this was the final nail in the coffin for me as to the band going pop. I will admit that there are two superior songs from this disc: ""Taking it all Too Hard"" (which still gets airplay even today (22 years later) on soft rock stations) and ""It's Going to Get Better"" and again are outstanding songs, but the rest of the disc is rubbish!"
4,Did this just become available on MP3?,This is a great album from the 80s that you can listen to without skipping a track. Did this just get released as an MP3 album? I just bought the CD version a last week. Some of Genesis works were not available on MP3 before but it looks like most of it is now.
5,genesis,i don't care what anybody says genesis is a classic 80s cd songs like mama and that's all and taking it all to hard .are my favrite songs and phil collins is at his best on this cd as well as the rest of the band . all the songs are a hit . did not care for the song silver rainbow . but the rest of the cd is 5 stars if you are a phil collins fan you will like this cd
1,probably the worst album of their career,"Genesis were, with their eponymous album, at the very bottom of their creative ability. Songs like Illegal Alien, Just a Job to do or That's All demonstrate that there were not enough juice in their inspirational well. Even the best of the album (the Home by the Sea suite) ranks just O.K. in Genesis' standard."
1,lackluster effort with mostly fillers and sub-par material,"This is easily Genesis worst album (Calling all Stations aside). Aside from the classics ""Mama"" and ""Home by the sea"" and the tolerable top 40 tune ""That's all"", the rest is plain garbage. ""Illegal Alien"" is horrible and takes way too long, the song doesn't know when to stop, the other songs are sub-par efforts and were obviously meant as fillers. The drum machine destroys ""silver rainbow"" and ""Second home by the sea"" completely.Suggestion: get ""Hits"" or ""Way we walk 1"" for ""Mama"" and ""That's All"" and ""Way we walk 2"" for the quintessential ""Home by the sea"" (12 minute live version). And be proud of yourself you steered away from this very mediocre effort"
2,Disappointing Vendor Experience,"My review does not speak to the stubby picks themselves but to the vendor. Although I paid for and was supposed to be sent a bag of six, I was sent a bag with only five and a hole in the bag where the sixth one was removed. It is not worth my time and money to return to get the sixth pick, but I can put in a review saying so. Therefore, whether you select these picks or not, I would recommend using a different vendor."
3,"These Are Purple, Not Black!!","So, these picks are really nice, but the picture is not what you will get. These picks are translucent purple. Other than the strange color, they are good picks. They really do help with speed and accuracy. Great for mandolin playing.Updated: Amazon has changed the image for this item, so now the picture really does show what you will get."
5,my favorite picks,"these picks are hard plastic and like a good tool don't flex at all. they also have little grips on them so they won't slip between your fingers. very bright sound. they might be a little noisy (picking sounds) on an acoustic, but clean electric is just bright and chimey."
5,Great Picks,These picks are awesome. The grip and angle of attack are perfect for fast solo picking.
2,Good grip and OK sound -- but don't expect to receive the color pictured.,"I like the grip on these picks, and the sound quality isn't bad -- but nor is it worth this price for everyday strumming. Also, don't expect to receive picks that are any shade of white or blue, as pictured -- I received transparent purple picks that weren't at all easy on the eye. If you want a thick pick that produces sound similar to the Big Stubby and has a good grip, I'd recommend 1.14mm Everly Star Grip Picks instead. Obviously not as thick of the 2mm Big Stubby, but then again -- the 2mm is excessive for most picking needs."
5,Fat picks,If you like really thick picks then these are the ones for you. I really like the dimple in the center. Makes them slightly harder to drop.
3,Maybe good for guitar.,I tried it for my mandolin but the sound was not of good quality. I plan to give it to a friend of mine who plays the guitar.
3,Good grip,These picks are new to me but very usefull as spares.They have a great grip and when used right they are fast.Dunlop Big Stubby 2.0mm 6 Pack
3,big business,"it was just as getting a regular dvd , instead of a bluray, i know it was an older movie. but i think they could have done some research and found some commentary, delected scenes, extras, or even interveiwed the actors. I was slightly disappointed."
4,Mixmatched Twins!!,"Bette Midler and Lily Tomlin together; sure to be a funny movie. That is very true though onscreen it seems weird that these two would be related in anyway whether familial or friendship. Twins were mismatched at birth and then given to a poor, country couple and the other two to a rich family. Unbeknownst to many for forty years, Bette belonged to the rich family and Lily to the poor ones. As the movie goes on, the twins meet up with one another and that is where the suspense occurs. The supporting cast which includes many men who are the love interests of these women do a great job and Bette and Lily are very funny as Bette is her usual wild, redhaired, funny self and Lily is the foundation holding the movie together while Bette remains herself. Get this movie especially if you like Bette or Lily or even if you have, know or want twins. Great movie!!"
3,BIG disappointment,"I love, love, love this movie. It is one of my all-time favorite comedies. Perfect chemistry among the cast...sharp, witty, biting dialogue...a hysterical comedy of mistaken identities.Unfortunately, the Blu Ray release left me greatly disappointed. I see no difference in the quality of the picture or sound from my DVD. In fact, the picture aspect ratio has actually been cropped from 1:85 to 1:78...not a huge difference, but one wonders why it was even done.No extras at all, zero. Not even a trailer.But, for the bargain price I got this for today at Target ($3.99), I shouldn't really complain. It's just, to me, a missed opportunity to give this wonderful comedy a chance to showcase some extras.No real reason to pick this up on Blu...again, I saw no difference in the quality, and a bit of a cheat on the aspect ratio from what you may already have on DVD."
1,"Wrong 'region', this DVD won't play in my region","I received this product/DVD much slower than usual. Should have known that something was wrong. It is a DVD from London & won't 'play' on my DVD player. This was NOT made evident in the ordering info. I'm in the process now of sending it back to the seller & hope for a full refund, which I probably will have to 'fight' for! All in all, I'm totally disappointed with this transaction."
3,Barebones Blu Ray,"I love this movie, but in this day there is no excuse for not having any special features, also video could be sharper."
5,One of the best classic 80s movies!,"Bette Midler and Lily Tomlin are at their comedic best, with a great supporting cast which includes Edward Herrmann and Daniel Gerroll as Sadie's (Midler) grovelling executives, Fred Ward as Rose's (Tomlin) love interest and John Hancock as the frank, no-nonsense chauffeur.Other noteworthy credits include Michael Gross, Joe Grifasi, Mary Gross and a very young Seth Green.This is a must-see!"
4,"Funny, full of belly laughs","Great movie. Hilarious. A good workout for your abs. Does make some leaps to get it to end where it does, but who needs a long drawn out ending? Has very little violence and would make be a good movie to show to a mixed company audience even though it is not G rated. I really recommend this movie in any collection."
4,An Very Entertaining Film about Mistaken Identity.,"Two Mismathced Twins (Bette Milder & Lily Tomlin), one Raised in a West Virginia Country and Another Raised in the Wealith Business and Power of New York City. While the Two Mismatched Twins from Virginia (Also Milder & Tomlin) are going to meet for the First Time (Unexpected) into One Crazy Situation.Directed by Jim Abrahams (Co-Director of Airplane! and Ruthless People) made a fine (If Unoriginal) Screwball Comedy with Some Moments of genuinely Funny Moments. A Box Office Hit in the Summer of 1988, a Delightful Film, which is Fun to Watch. Grade:A-."
3,Goofy and sweet,"For me, this is Bette Midler's funniest movie - Lily Tomlin, maybe her third funniest. Their facial expressions and body language are a perfect complement to the goofy dialogue, i.e. ""Is this how we dress for the office? You look like a blood clot!"" ""Eat the g-damn muffin and try to show some poise."" It's a fun movie to watch and a nice alternative to today's ""event"" movies. Laugh and lighten-up!"
2,DVD Not Worthy of the Movie,"I was on a waiting list to get this DVD since I love this film. Disney must have been cheaper than usual when formatting this disk, because it has no special features. Oh I take that back, Disney did manage to hawk their upcoming cheesy straight-to-video cartoons in the previews before the feature. Does that count as a special feature? There are not even director's or actor's commentaries on the soundtrack or any information about the making of the film that fans would have loved to see. The only thing we could hope for would be a special edition possibly when the film turns 20, but don't count on it. Although a disapointment, still better than a VHS."
2,an oldie movie,Saw it when I was a kid with my mom....it was funnier when i was a kid. Ended up giving the movie to my mom and she loves it.
5,Big Business,Great movie that has not lost its appeal since I last saw it about 17 years ago. Very entertaining.
5,Funny,"Great movie, watched it growing up and always loved it. Only had it on VHS so now I can enjoy it on Blueray!"
4,80's throw back,"Good movie, needs Special FeaturesThe movie is absolutely great. However, I've seen the movie and what I was looking forward to on the DVD was special features. How great would a commentary by Bette Midler and Lily Tomlin be. But unfortunately there were absolutely no special features included with this movie."
5,I like this movie,"I enjoyed this movie, it's fun to watch I think Bette Midler and Lily Tomlin play well off each other."
3,Nostalgia,This is one of my very favorite movies. I was a little bummed to find it at Target for 5$ on blu-rey. But it's still not a bad purchase. You are sure to laugh and enjoy yourself. The product came exactly as described. New.
4,double fun,"the film is a dated eighties film for two divas of the screen. some of the comedy is situational, and you really can't put a price on mixed-up siblings. but when they are mixed-up twins the situations can get pretty unreal. and when the actresses playing the twins are tomlin and micler, you can get hysterical laughs just from the presence of the two.the story of two sets of twins has been played alot over the years, and this takes the cake. admittedly, the comedy is physical and situational, and actresses-driven, but the three blend well together.you don't go home with a feeling to change the world or save the dolphins or save mother earth, but you do go home with a snap in your step from the comic misadventures of both rose and saidie, and rose and sadie (tomlin's and midler's characters' names)."
5,Big Business is a great funny movie.,BIG BUSINESS is a great funny movie. If you Love Bette Midler and Lily Tomlin this movie is for you. This movie is so funny it make you laugh so hard it may bring tears to your eyes. Bette and Lily are two funny Diva's.
5,Passionate reading,"Viktoria Postnikova is a great Tchaikovsky interpreter. She did splendid performances of thetwo piano concertos with the Wiener Symphoniker, under her husband, Gennady Rozhdestvensky. Herreadings are tipycally expansive, passionate, careful on detail, and extremely romantic. Whilethis approach doesn't fit the best in the 2nd, it works perfectly in the first, included in thisCD. Postnikova did here a very moving performance that could be placed among the best available.A safe recommendation."
4,loved it,this shoe is so pretty! it makes my big foot (size 10) look very feminine. It's also very comfortable. I only gave it 4 stars b/c I ordered the white color and the canvas covering the sole is too light of a color so after washing it a few times it looks worn out (maybe buy one of the darker colors to avoid this?). But other than that... great shoe .
4,Un magnifico tercer disco del gran Camilo Sesto,"Fue uno de los primeros discos que compré, allá por 1988 en su versión LP, se acuerdan?... Indiscutiblemente un muy buen disco donde a mi gusto sobresalen dos supercanciones: la de Algo Más, con su letra sencilla pero de pensamiento profundo y, la Sin Remedio, donde el Camilo escritor nos hace entrar en la nostalgia de lo que pudo ser, y que inevitablemente se fue sin remedio... Si volviera a nacer volveria a quererte, sin remedio... Una muy buena canción... Si es cierto, me gusta como canta Camilo Sesto."
4,"What a crazy, kooky conglomeration of nutcases!","What a sweet book! Ms. Jeffrey devoted much time to character development and plot background. The Texas desert's smells and sounds make you feel as if you have just to walk outside your door and you're there. The reader can only empathize with Marisa's life and admire the choices she's made while feeling as hopeless as Marisa does with the future staring her in her face. And such an assemblage of characters as the town's inhabitants! What a crazy, kooky conglomeration of nutcases! But, kudos to Ms. Jeffrey, you can't help but root for them all throughout the book.The only drawback I felt was the ending came too quickly. I would have liked to see one of KA's epilogues so that we could find out how things turned out after......But, that's a whole 'nother book."
3,It was okay.,"A decent read if you are looking for something soft to fill your time. While the plot line was written well, it was predictable. There were some grammar issues within the book, but not enough to aggravate, just enough to notice. The characters were fun. I liked seeing all the crazy people living in one small town. I did feel that the ending could have given just a bit more, as I almost felt let down with how it all ended. I would read this author again.This was a free Kindle Download."
3,Slow,This book was just okay for me because it seemed so long. It had wonderful moments and then just okay moments.
4,Good read,This book was a nice read. Very pg 13 in the sex department. I feel like the author just suddenly ended it though. Everything just suddenly fell in to place. Overall a good book.
5,Romantic read,A great romantic read for all ages. I love how in the end Terry realized that family is more than blood!
5,Great read,"I truely enjoyed reading this book. I couldn't put it down. My only complaint with this and all the other books I have read via Kindle and Kindle Fire is the lack of proofreading being done. The misuse of text, spelling. punctuation, etc. is crazy."
4,Another good one from Anna Jeffrey's,"I choose this book because I had read ""The Love of a Cowboy"" and totally loved it. I really enjoyed Sweet Water. Full of odd characters and a story line that's a little different. I loved the two main characters. I was expecting something else from the ending by what was hinted at in the end. I really nice read. Anna Jeffrey is now on my list of favorite authors."
3,good story,"Loved the main characters and their stories of back ground and moving forward in their lives and relationship with each other. However, there was so much backinformation on the other characters that it got distracting to read all of that on those characters. I felt that took away from the story. Still a good read."
5,Jeffrey's Best Yet,"Anna Jeffrey can spin a yarn. More importantly, she can make you care about her characters. Marisa, a young woman who is caring for her mother with Alzheimer's, is seemingly stuck in a small West Texas town full of misfits and oddities. A real estate developer buys the little town on EBay with the idea of turning it into an upscale waystation for travelers. He's looking for one more way to make money. What he finds is love and compassion and honor. Jeffrey touches my emotions like few other authors do. Marisa's mother is my mother, struggling with the ravages of a terrible disease. Her friends and relatives (unfortunately) act like my friends and relatives. This is a wonderful read full of real people. Don't miss it."
4,Dave & Co. Get Psychedelic This Time Out.,"Generally not as highly regarded as the blues-based rave ups on the previous ""Blues Helping"" album, the tunes on ""Forms and Feelings"" are actually quite good. Doing a 360-degree stylistic turnaround, the band now explored revved-up classical rave-ups (Sabre Dance, Farondole), late-sixties psychedelia (In The Land Of The Few, Why How-Now) with a couple of nice ballads (Seagull, People People) thrown into the mix. Blues purists probably scoffed at the somewhat outdated psychedelic overtones (the original LP cover looked like something from a Fillmore West light show), but overall, the songwriting and performances still hold up extremely well, even after 29 years. Maybe not the perfect way to experience the awesome guitar work of Dave Edmunds, but recommended nonetheless."
4,"Forms and Feelings-Sabre Dance ""Tinkering""","In reading all the reviews posted so far regarding this album,I think something needs to be cleared up. The track ""Sabre Dance"" was not recorded at the speed that you hear on the album. It was played slightly slower on the initial recording,and was then sped up for the final mastering. At the time the thinking was that the track,as recorded,needed something ""extra""in order to give it more immediacy and power. A close listen will tell your ears that the tempo is not quite right-regardless of the power of the finished track-which is a good listen."
5,One of my favourites,"Born in Norway, my English isn't good, but this record is so splendid, I just have to tell you. The heavy stuff is very very intensely great and unique. And if you like Beatles, you will l also love the few soft ones. Even the blues-song is allright, although I hate blues. Most people who've heard this record praise Sabre Dance as the best song, but I think it's too noisy and monotonous. But the rest; unreal!"
2,Not very Good,I bought this because of the ability to shoot metal fastener nails as well as framing and shething nails. Turns out it will only use plastic coated metal fastener nails wich I can not find locally. Another issue I have had is that it does not stop firing when empty or close to empty. And it is hard to shoot at angles. I returned it and opted for the tried and true Hitachi.
5,Excellent,"Was in very good condition, anyone could tell it was not brand new. But only looked like it was a week old, barely any use. It came without oil which some other reconditioned units I previously purchased came with. Make sure you buy oil with the purchase if you don't have any. Have not tried the metal connector attachment but have used this nailer for 2 weeks and it has been great. The depth adjustment, with only takes seconds to adjust, will even allow you to leave the nail head exposed 1/4"" or more so you can attached ledger boards and other items for easier removal later. Great tool for the price."
5,A brilliant read,"If you listen to Oscar Peterson recordings and ever wonder just how and why he became so great this is he book to read. An accurate and facinating biography of Peterson from birth right up the year 2000 in this updated edition.The book is full of little musical details that you won't know about. Stories about Oscar's influences, his musical competetiveness and his abhorence of racism. There is lot written on the mixed reaction to Oscars playing over the years. Nobody disputes he has (or had) technique of the highest standard, but some critised him for lacking originality and Miles Davis (in)famously once said ""...he even had to learn how to play the blues"". All this is discussed and more.A great biography of a great artist."
5,Cover your stove,"If you leave your camp stove outside, exposed to the elements, you should keep it covered. This does the job quite well, and has elastic cords underneath to secure it, which is necessary here in Texas where it gets quite windy at times."
2,Too Bulky,"I have been a professional flooring installer for 28 years. I was happy with the simple rubber knee pads I have except that they wore out too quickly. I bought the Fluid Forms 1003F Patella Ts thinking that the fluid patella pad would be comfortable and thinking they would wear well. What I found was the straps were uncomfortably bulky when my knee was fully bent, which is how I am quite alot, and would probably strain my knee if I wore them all day. Which is unfortunate as straps do not get the wear and tear to necessitate being so bulky especially with TWO of them. The ones I wear have a single simple 2"" elastic strap with Velcro and have never worn out before the pad. In fact I reuse the straps for other things. Thanks but no, I am returning mine until this strap issue is resolved."
2,don't buy these pads,"The actual knee cushion part is great but if they are around the side of your knee, your shins, your ankles, or the straps are binding and causing such pain you can't wear them, then they are useless. I've had these for a couple years and they are lousy. I was staining my hardwood floor and just decided to go bare kneed they were that uncomfortable. I've never been able to get them to fit properly and am constantly adjusting and restrapping. Total waste of money."
2,"What a great idea, but...","I thought that these would be the best thing i could buy for my husband, who is a professional wood floor installer. He thought they looked great too! Until he tried to wear them to work. First problem was that they were so big around compared to his leg. He had to pull the velcro strap so far that there was hardly any strap to hook on and then there was all that extra strap getting in the way. They were much to big and bulky. A nice thin strap and they might have something!"
2,Knee Pads,"Our purchase of your merchandise was just fine, however, pertaining to the merchandise, the items were not as advertised. One cannot wear the knee pads without pants or trousers, as the material will wear your skin off your knees. Additionally, they are not as soft as advertised."
3,"Interesting, but not systematic or rigorous","The book deals mainly with two issues. First, why did people believe in the idea of state intervention (or collectivism, as Skidelsky calls it). Second, is state intervention good or bad. I argue that the first part is better than the second.I am uncertain whether to recommend this book. One the one hand, it is highly readable, the scope is very large, and many of the arguments are important. On the other hand, it is not novel, systematic or rigorous. In sum, this is a good book if you want a relatively short, easy and good overview of some of the issues in modern political economy. However, if you want a complete academic treatment of state intervention your desire is better served by other books."
3,"Informative, but hopelessly boring","Considering the unpretentiouness of this book regarding in-depth analysis, the prose could be less contrived and monotonous. The facts presented in the book, overall, were already familiar to me because I have been studying ths subject lately. I must say that the author's analyses, even if superficial, are worthy of respect - he clearly knows the subject and is not falling for hasty and inaccurate generalizations. When he generalizes, he says so.Even then, I found the text incredibly boring and had to fight sleep while reading it. He could have added some spice to the text by mentioning a few anecdotes, some colorful examples, some interesting comparisons, etc. I gave it 3 stars because the text is too dry and this is unnecessary and undesirable considering its subject matter."
4,A resume of Latin American History,"This is a long, short resume of the history of Latin America since the Independence to 1980. Highly recomended, since it is one of the best history writers from the territory. Good luck with it."
5,Excellent guide towards successful and healthy dating,"I picked up this book mainly because the cover was great! As I read through this book I realized how amazing the advice, information and tips are. The self esteem boosters really work and help to build confidence. The chapters on predators, and how to identify them is something I have never seen before and is something every girl should be aware of.I would highly recommend this book to any woman of any age who is dating!"
4,leads are great..good movie,"this is about Cumming and Leigh(also directed the movie) and they throw a party and when everyone gets settled in and having a good time in downward spirals into a dramatic climax..which is really good, I mean Alan Cumming(GoldenEye) is great as always and Jennifer Jason Leigh(Rush) has never been better.shot in digital video by John Bailey. other cast members include Kevin Kline(A Fish Called Wanda), Pheobe Cates(Drop Dead Fred), Gwyneth Paltrow(Duets), Parker Posey(PArty Girl), Jennifer Beals(FlashDance), John C. Reilly(A Perfect Storm), JAne Adams and Michael Panes."
1,Must Miss---Simply Dreadful,"Hubby and I unite on this one, calling it the worst movie we've seen all year, or in the bottom 3 films. What is it about? The most unlikable characters imaginable, all who work in the film industry. Featuring one obnoxious, self indulgent character after another, they all proceed to wallow together and snipe at one another in a ""celebration"" of the lead couple's Anniversary. That every one of these people only has others hang around him or her to advance ""the"" film career is hardly a revelation. I couldn't stand being around any of them for over a minute. Ironically, we like most of the actors seen here in other films, Leigh, Klein, Paltrow, et al, and conclude that being in this film was an enormous lapse of judgment on all their parts. OTOH, if this was letting their hair down and showing us what they are really like in their private Hollywood lives, I feel sorry for all of them. Ugh."
2,"Egocentric, Neurotic, Annoying Film","""The Anniversary Party"" was full of big-headed Hollywood actors and it was not worth my time. I couldn't stand the characters, who were all neurotic and psycho. It was as if these actors made the movie for themselves, and I wasn't invited to their ""Party."""
2,Lots of Name actors. Lame plot,This movie wastes alot of talented actors. Jennifer Jason Leigh drags the movie down just like her character does in the story line. The scene of all these lame brain Hollywood types on Estacy is just sad. Too much drama and BS.
1,"So Boring, So Dumb","What was the point of this film? There is no lesson learned, no story to tell, no entertainment factor even associated with it. I guess it was an excuse for Jennifer Jason Leigh and Alan Cumming to try to prove that they have no imagination and get their Hollywood buddies together for 2 hours of nonsense."
3,Just give me a break.,"""Thumbs Down!""Cheap Hollywood humor with story combine for a 3 star film. The film has humor, but little class to surpass as really entertaining. The acting was semi-deascent, but the humor pits a downfall for the whole film. The Anniversary Party is no party anymore."
1,"Do yourself a favor, skip this dud","This is one party I'm glad I wasn't invited to. Celebrity couple Joe (novelist and now director) and Sally Therrian (actress) throw a party to celebrate their 6th anniversary. It's been a rocky marriage with jealousy and petty squabbling. They throw a party with ""close"" friends, neighbors they are feuding with and a up and coming actress that Sally feels her career threated with. It gets messy as the night goes along and lots is said and done because they are tripping on Ecstasy.Another the-world-spins-around-me movie. I don't know which would be worse, to have be surrounded by people like them or to be them."
3,Hollywood on Hollywood,"I am always sceptical of movies written by actors about actors. These movies usaully end up being self congratulatory and too stylish. This one is right up that alley but isn't to disgraceful. The acting, with a couple of exceptions, is quite good and the ""day in the life"" plot moves along pretty well. Most of the characters play a close resembelence to their hollywood selves and luckily they all seem pretty human. As far as the stylishness of it all, it takes place in a beautiful modern, well decorated hollywood hills home and everybody in the film is beautiful. Not a bad film considering all the egos involved."
2,Some funny parts but overall boring,"I viewed this film about 3 weeks ago, and I was very dissapointed. I thought it was going to be atleast somewhat interesting, but it was slow-moving and had a very simple not so good plot. All it was, was people taking drugs, women walking around topless, and couples splittng up.....that pretty much sums it up. I definately do not reccomend it."
1,Abysmal waste of talent,"Well, this has to be one of the most excruciating films ever made with such a top-drawer ensemble cast. The story is hackneyed and pointless, the characters are not only gratingly irritating but, more problematic, uninteresting, and the film becomes more and more painful as it progresses. With so many fine actors involved, you keep expecting something of value to transpire - but, before you waste two precious hours of your life watching this dreck, let me assure you that it never happens. The only amazing part is that somehow Cumming and Leigh concoct an ending that is even more contrived and ridiculous than the rest of the film. As one of the other reviewers mentioned, if this is how these people really live, I'd rather not know."
3,Wish I could watch it...,"I would suppose this is not the seller's fault, but this DVD is not formatted to play in a standard DVD player...so imagine my chagrin to find that I've spent money on this purchase...yet, it won't play in my DVD player. I am not impressed with this purchase...what a disappointment. And I'd heard that this was a good movie... hope to see it on cable someday...since this DVD won't work at all. I do not recall seeing, or reading anything about this DVD's 'incompatibility issues' with standard DVD players while browsing the product before purchase. Beware shoppers."
3,does anybody know?,"Does anybody know the soundtrack well enough to say who does the song at the outset of the ecstasy party - sung in a foreign language, with rather an operatic sound? Many thanks if you can help with any info."
2,Pointless,"The first third of the movie consists primarily of guests and hosts of a party greeting each other, and, as such, is unavoidably boring. The second third of the movie features a game of charades, which is embarrassing. The final third of the movie, though often self-indulgently mediocre, does possess some tension and drama, though it's largely derived from people's being mean to each other. Not my idea of a good time."
4,"IT'S ONLY ME, BUT:",EVER B EEN INVITED YO A SNOBBY PARTY. ESPECIALLLY WHEN THE HUSBANDS BEST FRIEND IS A WOMAN. LOADS OF FUN. JM
2,A vanity project,"This is definitely more interesting than a lot of the mass-market Hollywood pap that makes it into multiplexes, but that's not saying a whole lot. Basically, the plot and (mostly improvised, I think) dialogue are nothing spectacular. The actors work really hard to try to seem ""natural,"" as if they're filming a reality show instead of a movie, but none of them quite succeed. Gwyneth Paltrow in particular is very annoying as the film's airheaded ""perfect"" girl, and Phoebe Cates is quite a scenery-chewer--it's as if she's trying to make up for all the years she spent doing no acting whatsoever. Parker Posey's talents are completely wasted here. I'm a fan of Jennifer Jason Leigh and Alan Cumming, but this is a self-indulgent, forgettable film that never lives up to its potential."
3,A Peek into Hollywood Lives,"The party assembles a mixed group of mixed-up people to celebrate an anniversary of a troubled marriage.Their self-congratulatory behavior deteriorates as drink and drugs blur their thinking and undermine their judgement. It put my husband to sleep, but I kept watching to the end. I am still trying to think of some purpose for this film.Some of the other reviews tout it as an actor's training tool. I'd hate for future actors to think this was the way they should conduct their lives. Rather a sad movie in which sad, but glittery people's lives spin out of control.If this movie is a fair representation of how Hollywood types (writers, actors, directors) interact and think, then it is no wonder some of the movies today are such a mess."
2,Yawn yawn...,"There wasn't a single character in the movie that I fell in love with. Well, maybe the dog. Way over the top and yet boring, yawn, snoozer."
2,2 stars,"This movie was saved by the hired guns who showed up. Without big names it would have been nothing...I think ""Hollywood Circle Jerk"" would have been a more apt title. I found it boring and pretentious. It will be a while before I spin it again."

4,Great ensemble piece,"Although Alan Cumming does not come off as a very convincing heterosexual character, I thought this movie was extrememly well done. Jennifer Jason Leigh's face reflects so many deep emotions, she is truly a gifted actress."
5,A classic,"Beaches is a classic movie. It was the first movie that I watched as a child that I cried and tried to cover my eyes so nobody would see me!! I had the vhs movie as a teenager and now I purchased the blu-ray. This is a great movie about life, love, and especially friendship. It is incredibly funny, dramatic, sad...it's got a little bit of everything. I have seen this so many times I can recite the lines. If you are purchasing this it is likely because you have already seen it and love it as I do. If you have not seen it and like the kind of movies that make you laugh one minute and cry the next, this is for you. I feel this is a classic I will carry with me throughout my life. I love it!!"
4,Great viewing after I cleaned the DVD,"Product arrived on a timely basis; while I would buy from this vendor again, I was disappointed that I had to clean the DVD in order to gt it to play properly."
4,Great movie,Always love Bette in this movie. Her role was perfect. Always reminds me of my long time friends. We will always be together. Enjoyed all the other players in this sad but wonderful movie.
3,SHOWCASE FOR BETTE,"This is an okay movie about the lifelong friendship between two very different ladies. The story is a little too manipulative and pulls at the heartstrings a bit too much for my taste, but it is a good showcase for Bette Midler who gets to sing a few songs along the way. Barbara Hershey is solid as usual, but her role isn't anywhere near as flashy and prominent as Midler's. It's well worth seeing, but I wouldn't purchase it until I did."
1,couldn't play it!,"Unfortunately I hadn't anticipated not being able to play it in the UK due to it being a different area code to the USA and Canada. Had presumed as shipping to the UK was an option, it would work. My favourite movie so a bit gutted and ten quid down the drain."
5,Keep The Kleenex Handy,"What can I say? Fashioned after the all-time ""tear jerkers"", this movie should spark some self-investigation into how we treat our friends as well as each other. But I have to warn you, it is a tear jerker. One of Bette's best."
3,Great.,"Oldie but goodie, saw it after seeing parental guidance., we all need a good laugh these days. Carol. Great great."
5,"Wonderful, Beautiful, Amazing, Captivating, Extraordinary Brilliant Movie","This is my all time favorite movie of all time! The first time I saw this movie I was eleven years old and still at the age of 29 I love it the same. I can laugh, cry, think, smile, frown at certain scenes throughout this movie. If you have not yet seen this movie, what are you waiting for? This is definitely a must-see and I highly recommend anyone that loves a good drama, tear-jerker movie to see this one but even with the tears, there is bliss that overcomes it. I love Beaches, and so will you!!!"
4,good dvd,this DVD is good. it is about a long term friendship of 2 people meeting from unlikely connections. Bette Mitler and Barbara Hershey are good in this. show biz and other rich meeting. not always likely. this is a good story and I can relate.
5,"Uplifting and Emotional, But A Whole Lot of Fun!","I loved Beaches so much! I watched the movie on the WE network, but it was still good enough for me to pick up the DVD. The movie remind me so much of friendship with my best friend, that I love so dearly. I don't know how I would go on if I lost my friend to a terminal illness, cause we're so much like sisters. The movie just so heartfelt and tender hopefully every friend of a friend will get this movie."
3,"Great Film, Bad DVD.","I would actually give this film 3 1/2 stars. Bette Middler is just incredible. Bette's timing is perfect. Watch Bette as someone is talking to her in a scene, her facial reactions alone are just hilarious. She is a comedic genius. There are few movies that actually make me LOL, Bette's performance makes me laugh everytime in this film. The child who played Bette was also wonderful...Barbra Hershey pulls off the other half of the film OK, but it is Bette that makes this movie. Great soundtrack too! I always get teary eyed when Bette is singing ""The Glory of Love"" at the end of the movie, and waves up in the air to heaven at Hillary.But why is this a barebones DVD release? This was a huge movie. there are no extras? WHY? Not even a trailer? The DVD gets only 1 star. The movie gets ***1/2. Boo to Touchstone for putting this classic film on such a cheap DVD."
4,sort of ok,Product was in decent condition except for some sort of sticky residue on the outside of case. I would have cleaned it prior to shipping personally.
1,Dvd didnt work :(,unfortunately the dvd didnt play. To much hassle to return but was bit dissapointed since it was a gift for my parents. Oh well its happens... just hope not all the time.
2,"Ok, but...","Abraham Lincoln's law partner once wanted to read some maudlin poetry to Abe. Once he was done, Lincoln said ""The people who like this sort of thing will find it the sort of thing they like.""Beaches is fine. It is obviously a chick flick. Bette Midler has some real opportunities to sing. The acting is good. The problem is that the plot is so predictable."
1,Twaddle!,"Even Joan Crawford would have passed on this old-time ""weeper."" Do yourself a favor--because no afternoon will ever be rainy enough, and no boyfriend inattentive enough to eat a pound of chocolate and sit through this."
1,Not That Good,"Me and my mom rented this movie from our public library looking for a lood chick flick. We got one but it wasn't good at all.It follows two girls who meet one the beach one day and they become friends for life. It skips about ten years when there in there early twentys and they are still friends. A little strange but still the same they are still friends. They meet in New York where Midler is a struggling actress. Midler invites the other one to life with her, which she does. It goes on trough love, sadness, death and many things that would make a good movie, but in here it was just too much.It is over two ours and gets very boring. I found a lot of scenes twored the end that just drag the movie on. It gets VERY boring VERY fast. Midler caries the story on her shoulders and she just plays it her usual happy-go-lucky character she always plays. If you want a good chick flick see it but if you want a RELLY good movie, don't. It isn't that good."
5,THE BEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN,"This was a truly touching movie. I could watch it over and over and never get tired of it. It is a truly touching movie and a must have. I wish there was more people in the world like C.C. Bloom. She is a trip! I first saw this movie when I was 10 years old, and I am still watching it. And crying all through it.It is a total tear jerker."
4,Great Musical,I've had this on video tape since it first came out and now I had to get the DVD because of the music. It sounds so much better than the video tape.
1,NOT worth buying,"My mom is in DAR and I bought this for her as a birthday present, however now that I've seen it, I don't think it's worth giving. I saw that it was ""26 pages"" but when I received it I was surprised at how large the print and the margins are. If you copied and pasted the entire text into a Word document I doubt it would fill 3 pages.There are also pages in it that look like photocopied documents, but they're not readable at all. One page looks like a photocopy of the back of another book and it's just a big black smudge on the page. Ugly and pointless.I'll be returning this."
5,you can never have too many stickies,"When these were offered really cheap- I bought 'em.At our age, my husband and I need reminders for justabout everyting- Now we are set for awhile."
5,Nursing home project,"These Poat-it notepads fit perfectly with the Staples Non-Grip Gel Stick Pens for a project with assisted living residents. They had fun making the project, and my familyhad fun helping them."
1,POP UP NOTES,"An order was placed for post it pop up notes for a desk top dispenser. The wrong item was shipped twice, forcing me to purchase elsewhere."
5,There is nothing like a POST-IT Brand Product,"I have tried every type of post notes and by far, there are none better than the Post-It brand. Save your money and buy the best from the beginning."
5,Great little Post-Its!,Can't beat the original post-it! Quite the savings on Amazon than from Staples. It's nice to get such a big package so I don't have to worry about stocking up for some time. I'm glad I found them here!
4,Great Quality\,I bought these sticky notes to help keep track of various to dos and other labeling needs around my home and office. I find that they are of good quality and stay together well and stick well to surfaces I need to put them without coming off. I also find the yellow color to be perfect for writing on and the thickness of the paper to be perfect. I also think they are quite portable and easy to carry as well. Many other post it notes are thin and not made as well.
5,FANTASTICO,Fantastic presentation of Southern Italian music...nostalgia willtransport you into another era.
4,red hot and flamenco,"That's it. In todays world many musicians are driving with no sense in the highways of the mix of rhythms. But not all are aware of the essence their mixin' in. Martires del Compas follows the rules of true feelings and while listening their albums you can feel their heartbeat. A strong, clear and lovely union with the african sounds and their little children (blues, rock, etc). If you are musician by sure will be amazed by their musical skill, and if you go beyond and translate the lyrics will found out it all makes sense: a vision of todays world and its traditions, with sarcasm and intelligence, along with great funk explosions ( la penultima cena), african percussion (la llave)and southern flamenco psicodelia (jorgue). Everything ""al compas"" (the timing for flamenco music, it's pure, not very known in occident). If you are looking for new exotic sounds with lots of content, this band is for you. There is a new album out now."
4,Real Insight,"I consider this one of the best around. After going thru 5 or 6 different guides, I find the structure is good with loads of information and makes easy reading."
4,Plasplug model DWW405,"I purchased a similar model at Home Depot for more money than the one offered by Amazon. We intended to tile 3 bathrooms: counters and two large showers, and a kitchen with four counters and backsplashes. We also used it to help tile our daughter's kitchen. We probably cut 400+ tiles before the motor started making strange noises. Before that the fence guide hold-down broke, making straight cuts more difficult but not impossible. With one shower to go, we will probably buy a new one. It's worth the price compared to renting and being able to go at your own pace."
3,"It works well, but...",I did one pretty big job with the Plasplugs wet saw and the motor burned out. I would recommend the saw for someone who has a big job because it still beats renting a wet saw but it's not for a pro. They will replace the motor for $ but that's more than the saw costs.
4,A decent value,I bought the saw for home use to tile 700 SF;with every tile requiring cutting. The motorburned out with only 5 tiles left to cut. Thiswas a three week project so it was still muchcheaper than renting a saw. I got my money's worth.
5,Impressively deep,"Snyder really tells three stories here, and interweaves them with lyrical brilliance. We see the modern Jason Keltner deal with solving a mystery in his usual Gentlyesque fashion, but at the same time we get both a formative story from his childhood and excerpts from a fictional early 20th century hardboiled detective novel. The invented crime fiction forms a backdrop for Jason's transition into adulthood, which in turn is reflected in his modern day situation. Whilst the main plot amounts to not very much in the end, the journey Snyder takes us on is thrilling and engaging. The language accurately evokes that peculiar sense of teenage loneliness and camaraderie that so many of us carry into our adult lives; it would be hard not to empathize with fifteen-year-old Jason as he is suddenly and harshly rejected by his closest friend. An innovative and insightful read."
2,Author tries to be too descriptive;hard to read;aggravating,"Clodfelter must have spent days paging through his thesaurus, looking for descriptive words he hadn't used already.Was very hard to read, I found myself having to put the book down because I got so pissed off because of Clodfelter's bogus ""flowery language"".If he had just written it as it came to him, it would have made much more pleasant reading.Clodfelter did have some unique experiences that I hadn't come across in my previous reading of the Vietnam War."
3,Murray Bag Review,"The bag was delivered as promised.It is new, so the quality is excellent.I would have loved a frame to go with the bag but none was offered."
5,this CD is one of the most funny CDs I have ever heard,"When I first heard this CD i loved it so much I went out and bought it. This cd renders you on the floor laughing. (Well, almost)."
4,...BHG...,"...Blood Hound Gang releases yet another yet of hilarious, comical, up-beat hits in 'One Fierce Beer Coaster'.Starts out strong with four great tracks: 'Kiss Me where it smells funny', 'Lift your head up high', 'Fire Water Burn', and 'I Wish I Was Queer So i Could Get Chicks.' However after that they begin to mix in hip-hop, rap and other oddities, which though still humorous, are not as interesting musically.However, still recommended for all..."
5,catering to the lowest denominator of humanity,"this cd is just an endless barage obscenity, offensivness, foul humor and sensless noise. this music has no redeeming value, what so ever and these bunch of morons should get lives. sick, disgusting, crude.. i like it. that's probably why I own all thier albums.."
4,Wow...,"Alright, so I became a Bloodhound Fan after becoming addicted to ""The Bad Touch"". But, after hearing Horray for Boobies, I wanted to see this band's other music. Well, Use Your Fingers was a tad disappointing, but that's only because Daddy Long Legs was writing along with Jimmy Pop. ""Fierce"", however, is the perfect redemption. This CD is awesome, with tons of great songs you'll be singing like crazy! Fire Water Burn, Lift Your Head, Nowhere Slow, Queer, all are great songs. So, why only 4 stars? Simple; Boom. Boom is a collaboration with Rob Van Winkle, and to tell you the truth it does not fit into the scheme of the CD. Sure, the rhyming will blow you away, but it's not that captivating of a song. Other than that, everything is great, just like the band...great! Oh, and yes Your Only Friends is long, but it is really funny! Jimmy Pop is a genius, probably the best white rapper you'll come across. Now, let's hope the new DVD doesn't ruin their reputation."
1,Buyer beware,"Wow - I didn't know they made albums this bad!At first the songs are kinda catchy - but they get old QUICK...100% pure, uncut garbage - It'll rot your mind."
2,Why Did I Buy This?!?,"What the heck was I thinking when I bought this CD?Seriously though. I heard the track, ""Fire Water Burn"" on 1.fm Flashback Alternatives. This track came out in 1996. I don't think I've heard it anywhere since then and I like it. So, when I heard it, I bought it so I'd finally have it in my collection.When I bought it, I figured there would be other good songs on the CD based on the one track that I liked. Unfortunately, none of the other tracks are anything like ""Fire Water Burn"". The CD is not terrible. It's got a lot of good rock and it's a little jazzy. If it didn't have lyrics, I think it would be great. LOL!If you like rap, hard rock and a little bit of vulgar language thrown in, this CD is for you and you should add it at once. If there are any of those three things that you don't like, you may want to pass on it.I also liked their rocky version of ""It's Tricky."" I could so see them performing it in a club!"
5,this cd is the s***....,"This cd rules!!! It is clever, funny, the lyrics are the bomb. What else can you expect from a cd that can even make vanilla ice sound cool."
3,The Classic-Dull but Essential,"This is the book that ignited American interest in Feng Shui 20 years ago. It takes the subject matter very seriously, and is not light reading--nor should it be. Feng Shui is a discipline that requires study to master. For anyone who wants to honor the art and science of Feng Shui, this book is an essential text and reference."
3,Not necessarily the place to begin.,"I'd had this book recommended to me as a good one with which to begin to understand Feng Shui. While I will agree that aspects of it were clear and full of practical application (the examples of room layouts, etc.), in general I found the book to be poorly organized and certainly not enough in and of itself to gain a basic understanding of Feng Shui.I found that I learned enough to be interested further, and got some practical advice about furniture placement. Not where I would send a beginner, however."
2,a tease without completeness,"This was my fourth feng shui book and I am somewhat disappointed. It started out well, with great intentions but never quite finished. There were stories repeated and the really important parts not completely explained. The cures were given for specific examples, but nothing was given as suggestions to figure out how to determine if you have the problems. I feel unsatisfied, although I will probably use some of the suggestions. Also, the 'second' part of the book was supposed to be devoted to a greater understanding of the mysticism behind feng shui and it was all just a little snippet of a much bigger realm. A bunch of religious babble and not enough explanation. Probably a tactic to buy more of her books. No thanks. I much prefer the Kwan Lau book, Feng Shui for Today or Terah Collins' approach."
2,Interesting but not complete,"This was an insightful book in some ways but very incomplete. Sarah gave good information about the Feng Shui philosophy but when trying to include the depths of various conections she falls short. For example,in the appendixes under explaining palmistry, she mentions that ""if you have a scar above the nose and between the eyes, this indicates death, accident, or illness at age forty."" I find this an extremely irresponsible thing to say. She never explains further nor says what to do if you happen to have such a scar. Both my husband and I have such a scar. We have 3 small children and turn 40 in the year 2000. Should we up-date our will or should we perform some sort of ritual for protection? I'm very upset at her nonchalance of such a statement."
2,"Clunky, flimsy,and barely usable","This product is virtually 100% plastic. If you're over 6 feet tall(I am 6 and a half feet tall) then you're going to have some difficulty with using it. I have had it since February and have used it only a couple dozen times due to the fact that I am a full time student and take summer classes and it's already falling apart. It does do okay when I try to use it but it is wobbly even though it was put together correctly (only a tiny metal bar connects the seat to the peddles). Assembly is simple with one exception, the resistance cord requires one to have either A) amazing upper body strength and teeth that are incredibly durable or B)2 people with average upper body strength pulling it in opposite directions while a third person tries to get it into the slit that it connects to. You are probably better of buying your exercise equipment from your local Walmart."
5,Very good,"Like all Post It products, these one are very good, also made from recycled paper, so if you like green these are the ones. Great price too."
5,Fits my Shopsmith perfectly!,This unit fits my Shopsmith perfectly. Will soon have more parts I can adapt to my Shopsmith with this unit.
5,Neutrogena body oil,I am trying to get rid of celluite on my legs and thighs...I know that it will take some time because it has been on my legs for many years. I love the way it smells and I just might have a chance to get rid of celluite. It is easy to rub in and it does not stay oily when you rub it in really well. I do like this product.
2,"Strong, terrible smell","I heard great things about this stuff so I went to the local drugstore to get some. I wanted unscented but they didn't have it so I got this instead. The oil itself is nice; I used it in combination with a body cream for these very dry winter months. However, the smell is truly awful and it consistently gave me headaches. Not only that, but the smell permeates through all layers of clothing and lingers until you wash them. I just could not get past the headache-inducing smell so I had to throw it out. I'm going to stick with one-ingredient, edible and non-stinky oils, like coconut or almond."
1,THIS STUFF STINKS!!!!!!!!,Literally. I like many other Neutrogena products but the scent in this stuff burned my eyes and gave me a splitting headache. I'm sending it back!!!!
5,Neutrogena body oil,Neutrogena body oil is great for lubricating your skin after the shower. It's a quick way to keep your skin moist.
5,Great moisturizer plus fantastic scent!,"I love this moisturizer and have been using it for 15 years. It is light, absorbs quickly, and leaves skin, well, luminous -- not exactly shiny, since it is absorbed well, but sort of shimmery (not that it has mica or any kind of makeup stuff in it).As a bonus, it has the most heavenly scent (does not smell like cooking oil, I promise) that lingers pleasantly but subtly.I use it for massage oil, too, because it doesn't make an oily mess all over. It is worth every penny. I love this stuff and can't say enough good things about it!"
5,Awesome for eczema!,"This oil did wonders for my eczema! I felt relief almost immediately after this stuff touched my skin, even on my worst patch. After a warm bath, blot excess water off your skin and apply a generous amount of the Neutrogena Body Oil to your skin and it really helps!The scent is nice too :)"
2,Nasty smell,"This oil feels ok. My problem is the obnoxious smell of this oil. It smells like Indian/Rasta/Hippie???? incense. I always cross the street whenever I see people selling these awful smelling scented things. Now I am stuck with two pints of this oil and I don't know what to do with it. Can't believe my stupidity in buying so much. I so much wanted to like this oil, how I wish it was unscented."
2,Contains some bad ingredients,"This product contains paraben which Dr Mercola is against, and it also contains BHT which Dr Perricone says is carcinogenic and is just added to fats and oils to preserve them. Can't American corporations just give us what is healthy and stop poisoning us?"
5,Great Deal,This is great not that many stores carry this now and the ones that do sell it for alot more.
1,The Smell is Awful,"My husband uses this. At first I thought the smell was nice. Now . . . it is nauseating, everywhere, and gives me a headache. I just ordered him the unscented. I hope it is better. Beware if you are sensitive to odors!"
2,Allergic reaction,"I have very dry skin. This seemed to be doing wonders for my legs/arms. But after three days, I broke out in the worse rash I've ever had. The itching drove me crazy & this lasted a week. I suggest you try it first on a small area. And, not just 'one time', but for a few days. (Takes a while if you're allergic). Other wise, I'm sure it's a great product for those who can tolerate the ingredients."
2,Bad Choice for a Massage Oil,"This product is hands down, the most effective I have ever found at ruining sheets. Because I liked the texture of the oil I used it for a treatment... once. My new sheets were hideously stained after one use. This product has a fantastic ability to wick through cotton, permanently bind to the fibers, and turn yellow-brown. I've never used another oil like it and I've been in practice nearly 20 years.Ha! You say. You're not a massage therapist. Why should you care? Because if it can do that to my sheets, it can do that to your shirts, your pants, and your bed-linen if you oil yourself up and go to bed without putting a rubber mat down first. Don't say I didn't warn you.Also, the smell is... inexplicable. Why, Neutrogena. Why?"
5,Great Product,I have used Neutrogena Body Oil for years. I keep it in the shower and add to my back for dry skin after my shower. Its a great value to buy through Amazon instead of a drug store.
3,Scent is too strong for me,"I liked the weight of the oil, it wasn't too heavy, but the scent was way too strong for me. All day I kept catching whiffs of it and it was giving me a headache."
4,"Light formula, light scent, very pleasant","This oil is great for keeping your hands soft and your bath water from being too drying (just be careful not to use too much or the tub can get slippery). It also is a great massage oil. Although it's sesame-based, it isn't food grade so don't try to use it in any situtation where you'd be ingesting it. ALso, don't use it as eye makeup remover because oil will sting and cloud your eyes temporarily."
5,Silky Smooth Skin,"I have always wanted to dry this. I finally bit the bullet, & bought a bottle. I wish I had done this sooner. I have noticed a huge difference in the softness & smoothness of my skin. The scent is extremely light. I will be buying this product again."
2,Hippie Stank,"Feel of the oil is fine, but I really can't believe I'm the only one to notice that this smells like patchouli oil. Reminds me of an aging hippie.I won't buy again since I don't like smelling like a head shop."
1,I've been fooled!,This book was so vague I have to believe it is an FBI plant to see who would need a book on disguises. I was doing a presentation on Sherlock Holmes and this book was not at all helpfull.
1,Simplistic,"What a let down. If you are reasonably intelligent adult and spend 30 minutes thinking about disguise, you should come up with at least 90% of what is in this book. At best this is a VERY simple starting point for broad ideas and general thoughts. If you want help with resources or real technique - look elsewhere."
4,Good Price for Good Gems,"Worth it just for the 1st disc. Discs 2 and 3 only have a few tracks that appeal to me, but all still good music. ""Touch Me Baby"", ""Lonely Man"", ""Keep On Trying"", ""Ramblin' Man"" and ""Su, Su, Su"" are all solid, but my favorite is ""It's Your Thing"". Great rendition of this one in particular. Gets the 4th star because of the cheap price."
1,PLEASE DO'NT BUY THIS!!!!!,The Bell trainer was around my price range and read other reviews for this so give it a try it's very loud even with road tirers. Switch my bike gears to low and still loud high gear even WORST. I just send it back the same day.
4,$72.99 for home exercise equipment,It's expensive for me but it's cheaper than a heavy exercise machine.
3,"Once again; Product=5,Amazon=1","The trainer is as advertised, and works great. Good unit for the money. Simple to set-up and use. I would certainly recommend getting a road-type tire for the rear of your bike if you are using with a mountain bike, as the vibration of the tire can get loud and be irritating after a while. But, I'm sure that's the case with any trainer.The problem... ...AMAZON. When I clicked ""THIS IS A GIFT"", I assumed it would arrive in some sort of nondescript packaging. No, it arrived in it's box, proudly displayed on my porch where, upon arriving home from work, my wife gat an early birthday present. HELLO? AMAZON? Anyone home? Second order in as many months that had problems. Seriously considering shopping elsewhere from now on."
1,Arrived broken,This item arrived in a beaten up box and was broken. Returning it was not easy (and they didn't have any in stock to replace it). I was very displeased with Amazon's poor shipment and customer service.
2,Difficulty,"Unable to maneuver my bike in the trainer. Just when I think it in, and try it out, it crashes."
4,Does the job,My only complaint is the tention needs to be easier to control; but it holds up well and it's good for when you need to cycle indoors.
4,Very good product...,"Prior to this purchase I knew nothing of bike trainers, and my motivation to purchase one was to simply allow my mountain bike to be used when weather or time do not allow for normal riding. So far, about a months use, I'm really pleased with it. There is no assembly required, and placing the bike into the trainer is very straight forward and easy. Some reviews have mentioned the noise, and I agree that it is noisy on the knobby mountain bike tires, but my wife has reported that she does not notice it in the house when i am in the garage using it. It's also nothing that some headphones cannot drown out for me while riding. I'm happy with the purchase, and I plan on getting a lot of use out of it."
4,Built like a stone wall....,"Great quality, works very well and now don't have to worry about someone killing me with their car."
4,Worth the money,I had a hard time choosing between product line...This bicycle trainer was in my price range...It seems well made and easy to use...So far I've not had a problem.....I think it was a good choice...Worth the money....
4,Great for the price,"Given the inexpensive price, this is a terrific buy. This trainer is fairly loud, so no early morning training sessions if you have folks downstairs...It comes with an extra skewer so that's nice, although you don't have to use it. There are certainly better trainers out there, but this is the best you will probably find for under $100."
5,indoor bike trainer,"Great affordable product. Set up was easy, I didn't need the extra axle piece. Seems stable during my ride. came fast. Resistance is from your own bike gears."
4,works for me,"My bike just sat, unridden, for two years. And all that time I was desperately needing some exercise. With the Motivator, I brought the bike in the house and put it in front of my TV. Now, whenever I am watching TV or reading, I do it riding the bike."
4,It will get you through the winter,"I am not a biker, I am more of a 30min 3 times a week jogger. It gets cold where I live, and I got this to keep in shape over the winter. It works well, and can give me a decent work out. It is a little loud with mountain bike tires. It lets me have an exercise bike without having it take up the room in my small apartment too."
1,Little to no resistance,"Let me start by saying I've never trained for biking before. I bought a slick tire for my mountain bike and hooked it up to this trainer. The noise with a slick tire is acceptable, but I was able to run in top gear without breaking a sweat. I simply overpowered this trainer. Other reviews said to tighten the trainer more than recommended to get additional resistance, but it really didn't make a difference.This may be okay if you are feather light and using a road bike with tall gears, but for my 180# frame on a mountain bike, it simply did not provide enough resistance. I returned this and got a CycleOps Mag and have had no problems (I'm not even on the top resistance setting)... guess you get what you pay for!"
2,not enough resistance,"the resistance tops out because it gets so hot that the disk can't generate enough eddy currents to provide the needed resistance. That is to say, the longer and harder you pedal, the easier it gets! They need to design more cooling into the device."
4,"Works good, Knob broke.","My trainer just arrived today and it works great. Only problem was that the black handle that is used to adjust the resistance against the tire broke. It cracked right in two and broke off from the screw before the assembly was even against the tire. Luckily the screw has an allen wrench hole at the end so it can still be used. As far as noise goes, it really wasn't that noisy. The amount of noise will depend on what kind of tire you have. Knobby mountain bike tires will be much louder than smooth road bike tires. Mine are hybrid tires for street riding so the noise was about on par with a fan."
1,"Not enough resistance to be challenging, and too loud to be useful","This is a terrible product which you should avoid. There is no way to adjust resistance except changing gears on your bike. Even at the highest gear, I don't think this approximates the difficulty of biking on flat ground. What's worse is that the product is so loud you will likely find it unusable. Even at slow speeds I need to wear ear plugs. At moderate speeds it sounds like a lawnmower. I can't recommend this product to anyone, and I don't understand how it received the positive reviews it has garnered."
3,"Decent Quality Stand, Confusing Instructions","I'll start this review by saying that I am not a road cyclist. Rather, I was looking for a way to get exercise on a mountain bike while indoors. The assembly instructions were very confusing, and not detailed at all. There is still one piece that is shown in all the pictures, but I have no clue what it does or how to use it in the bike's set-up. On the positive side of things, the unit has a dense build, so it does not shift while using it. It was also capable of housing my mountain bike for months of use. If you are using traditional mountain bike tires, it is LOUD!!! I would recommend finding a bald tire, especially if you live in an apartment and have downstairs, and upstairs, neighbors. Because they may or may not complain about the noise. Nevertheless, this trainer functions as intended, and does its job well."
5,No need for anything fancier,"I was a bicycle racer for over 10 years. For indoor training, you do not need anything fancier than this model. It is basic and effective. I bought it on sale for $83.62, which is an absolute steal. I am glad I bought it."
1,Not a real trainer,"I'm a competitive cyclist and borrowed this trainer from a friend to use during the winter and wow....this thing is terrible. Yes, it is cheap, and yes, it allows you to bike inside, however, forget this thing if you are looking for a workout. There is no resistance and the only way to work up a sweat is to crank the roller tight on the tire but get ready for burning rubber and dramatically decreased tire life. Spend a few more dollars and get a real trainer. The frame is also flimsy, be careful getting out of the saddle for sprints: I've dropped the wheel out of the clamps on several occasions because the lateral flex of the frame is so bad. Spend your money elsewhere."
5,Not Noisy!,"I have been using by Bell Motivator for about a month now and while it does produce a bit of noise, the cause is the rear bike tire tread NOT the trainer. My tire tread is fairly smooth and hence, little noise. A mountain bike tread would produce a lot of noise. If it really bothers you, buy a tread-less rear tire to reduce the noise level when your bike is used as a trainer.The wheel at the back of the trainer provides adjustable resistance level and I must say that a 20-minute workout with this trainer, makes me sweat as much as my normal 45 minute outdoor workout! I'd recommend this trainer to anyone who wants to keep up their biking routine, during the cold, rainy and snowy days of fall and winter (at least here in the NorthEast!)"
4,This Bike Trainer is a great value,"This bike trainer is a great value. The trainer arrived on schedule and no assembly required! Just pull it out of the box, unfold it, and turn the screws on each side until your bike is secured. I have been using it every day and it works great. I set the friction high on the trainer and then use the bike's gears for fine adjustment. For the price and ease of use, this is a great value."
1,if you don't want a work out but this,very disappointed. If you don't really want a workout than this is the trainer for you. There is virtually no resistance. I have a 27 speed road bike and I had to run my bike in the highest gear there was which made the magnetic unit whine and vibrate terribly. I rode for an hour and hardly broke into a sweat. I had a Giant Cyclatron which I liked but the bearings went bad after 4 1/2 years. I think I'll fix and go back to that.
2,indoor bike trainer,"it probably works well for a bike without knobby mountain bike tires. With the tires I have, the noise it makes is too much to use. Afriend with regular smooth tires is going to try it out."
1,Low price = Low resistance,"This trainer is great for turning your legs over, but if you want a workout, forget it and go with something better. To feel any significant resistance i have to be in my highest gears, and have a cadence of over 100. At that point the trainer makes a very loud whine.Long story short, if you are an experianced cyclist looking for something cheap, dont get this, because in a week youll be wanting something better, but if your someone that just wants to turn over their legs pretty easily for a low price, then this is for you."
5,Get Motivated with the Bell Motivator!,"I purchased this product for my daughter in college. She loves to exercise but is busy studying all the time. She has a 26"" bike and asked for the Bell Motivator Mag Indoor Bicycle Trainer so she can ride the bike in her apartment. Wow! This product is perfect for the job! It is built very sturdily and hooks up to the bicycle in only a few minutes. It's design creates a very stable invironment for the bike to be transformed into an excercise bike. The cost of the Bell Motivator is very reasonable and now my daughter is able to exercise with her bike each and every day. A great product at a very reasonable price."
4,Good value,"Wasn't sure what to expect with the noise, and while it's a bit loud it's actually not as bad as I had feared. Easy to set up and use. Seems to wear the tire pretty quick, I ended up buying a separate one to use with this. Overall, while it may not be as polished as a more expensive trainer, it still gets the job done."
4,Surprisingly sturdy,"This cycle trainer is much more sturdy than I had expected, and works great for excercising during the winter months. I have no complaints, only wish there was an easy way to move to another room with bike still attached, but not a big deal."
2,I need more resistance or maybe a different bike,"I couldn't get enough resistance with my mountain bike in top gear, I think I'm going to have to go for a spin bike instead. This trainer is not compatible with my Burley Canto recumbent. It worked fine, Amazon's shipping box was inadequate and the trainer's box was slightly damaged, I returned it and got a refund. Five stars for Amazon.com's return policies."
5,Excellent purchase,"Does exactly what it says. Easy to use and to take on/off. I have mountain bike so tread on wheel makes it a little noisy, but nothing that I'll wake up the neighbors. A few clicks higher on the tv vol and it's no big deal. Very good purchase"
5,FIrst Trainer,"I have a road bike, and honestly, I was surprised by how quiet it was. I watched tv without even putting the volume up from what it was, and could hear it fine. Some people equated the noise level to that of a vacuum and I would say perhaps with knobby tires, but with road tires, it was much quieter than my vacuum.Super easy to setup, was started in a matter of minutes. Using this to train for a sprint triathlon... Scared to use clipless on the real road. Works well, just need to put something under the front tire to get the bike even. This is much better than I expected!"
5,Works just like it is supposed to!,"This works better than we expected. You can use the knobby tires, but it is very noisy. we will change to slicks soon. We are happy with it."
5,Well pleased,"Well-built, easy to adjust, solid feel, takes up very little room, and costs less. What more could you ask?"
4,Great Bike Trainer for the Price,I live in a cold climate. When the wind is howling and the snow is falling I work up a sweat in my living room using this bike trainer. Inexpensive but does the trick. Easy to assemble.
4,Excellent value and good product,"This indoor trainer is a great value. It's not the fanciest one on the market, but it's does the job well. It produces a moderate amount of noise, but it's tolerable. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because the tension screw becomes loose from the vibration and I slowly loose pressure of the tire several minutes into my ride. I simply clamp a pair of vice grips onto the screw and wedge them against the floor. It's an easier fix than shipping the whole unit back. Overall, very good buy."
4,A little bit noisy,This bicycle trainer works very well. It's very noisy though which is why I rated it four stars. Installation is simple and easy but there aren't very clear instructions if you aren't familiar with a bicycle trainer.
4,Works but LOUD!,"I bought this so I could continue riding my bike during the winter. For the price, it works as advertised. The whole contraption can be laid flat for convenient storage. Setup can be done within a minute and taking it apart can be done in a similar time.The actual operation is loud. I've read the reviews about this being loud before I bought it so it was expected. What I found works is if you have a nice pair of noise isolation (or cancellation) headphones/earbuds, this isn't really too big of a problem. For the other people in the house, they may get a little annoyed. I set this up in the room and close the door so it's not too much of a bother. I'm using a hybrid bike that had almost road bike like tires which rolls smoothly.Overall, for the price, this is awesome to have if you want to keep riding your bike during the winter time. If you can find a way to put in headphones for music or to watch a movie, the noise problem isn't too bad except for the others in the house."
3,ok,"Much louder then I expected, very bad for neighbors underneath me in my apartment. Works ok, but I would have liked something with more resistance. I bought this right before my boyfriend moved in, so now I have no room for it, but I hope to use it again in the future."
4,Perfect little trainer,"Works like a charm, couldn't ask for anything better. Comes fully assembled and ready to drop your bike into. Not too loud as long as you have smooth tires."
5,Bell Indoor Bicycle Trainer,I love this product. There was nothing to put together just spread the legs and put the rear tire in the brackets...simple! I can now ride every day in my garage no matter what the weather. I intended to purchase one last fall from Sport Authority until I saw they were $200.00! I paid $79.99 from Amazon. I would recommend this product to anyone.
4,Great Product for the Price,works very well. have had no problems. other similar trainers are twice the cost. one downside that is common with most of these trainers... it's loud.
2,Disappointed,"I got this trainer after reading the reviews. Most were positive with only a few complaints about not having enough resistence. I figured since I was going to use a mountain bike and I am not a hard core cyclist it would be enough. I was wrong. I am young, 24, and in good shape so this was simply not enough to provide a decent work out. This would be enough if you are over the hill and needing something cheap and live by the rule, any work out is better than no work out (which I agree with). The noise was bad but not unbearable. I had to put the TV on full volume in order to hear it though. Most importantly Amazons costumer service on the return was perfection, as always."
4,Good basic trainer,This work well with it seems like most bikes... just tighten down and adjust the compression on the back tire and you are set.
3,"Easy to use, but noisy","My plan before the purchase was to use it in the morning before going to my job.But it is very noisy (with mountain bike on it), and I do not want to wake up my baby.That is my complaint.In the other hand, is very easy to setup and use.If you do not mind the noise, is fine for you."
4,Good Purchase for Beginner Riders,"I recently purchased this bicycle trainer for my home. With winter and the time change it wasn't safe to ride after work, this product allows me to get in my cardio workout while in the comfort of home. There was no assembly, just open the stand and anchor the rear wheel to the stand, then tighten the rear resistor. There is noise involved due to the friction between the tire and resistor but it was expected. It helps me zone out as white noise or if I want to turn on the TV I just put up the volume."
4,Great,We are very pleased with the quality for price of this trainer. It's a little noisy but seeing as how I am using it on a large tiled surface I expected this. It's exactly what I wanted and was delivered with no hassles. Very excited about this purchase. My husband was able to build a wood riser with extra wood we had and it's absolutely awesome!
1,amazon prime..not delivered!,"This order was supposed to be delivered before christmas with amazon prime... as of now, no delivery.Now I have to wait and see if it gets here by dec 28. Amazon can not say when it will be delivered.This does not make paying for amazon prime worthwhile.As for the product? I hear its good, it looks good.......but having paid for it and waited for it without results...0 stars."
4,"Quite pleased, but noisy",It works great and is the lowest price I could find. Only drawback is loud noise while spinning.
4,great for rehab after knee surgery,"Just had ACL surgery and this is great at home pt. Adjustment knob was broken when I got it, but emailed Bell. Great price!!"
4,"Good quality product, just a bit noisy","You can't go wrong with the price on this item. The structure itself is strong, does not look cheap and no assembling required. I wish the rotator was adjustable to set a stronger resistance but the price on those models are more than double.Some people reviews say it is a bit noisy but since I have mine in the living room and I use it while watching TV it makes very easy to ignore the noise. Specially if watching American Funniest Videos at night! =)It works for those days it is too dark/cold/hot to go bike outside. It definely has helped to increase my biking resistance."
5,Great Trainer,"I was really impressed by this product and didn't have to assemble anything, other than to put my bike on it. Yes, it had the extra piece that we had to figure out we didn't need (via another reviewer). It's not particularly loud especially when compared to the treadmill I had borrowed for a while! I'd buy this item again."
4,Easier to use than I thought,"This product was extremely easy to set up as well as to use. There is no assembly required - five minutes from opening the box to riding your bike!! One recommendation I would make to all users is that the trainer works best with road tires. The treads on trail tires create a loud sound and vibration while spinning. It still works fine, but the sound and vibration get a little annoying after awhile. Overall I was impressed with this trainer."
4,Does the Job,"As others have said, it's a wee bit loud. Other than that, it's a great product for the price. Stable, easy to set up, adjustable, and lets me train up without a problem on those rainy days when riding outside would be a miserable endeavour."
5,Great Trainer for the Money..,"Have put many many hours on this trainer so far this winter and it does just fine... Nothing fancy with no extras, but for a simple, all-purpose durable trainer this had been a great buy..."
4,Good Trainer for a Beginner at a Great Price!,"Really like the Bell Trainer and it's perfectly named - Motivator! Easy to get the bike on and off and doesn't take up a lot of space. Great for the price, too."
5,bell motorvator bike trainer,"Does eveerything I want it to do when the weather is too cold to bicycle outside. A little noisy, but it works just fine."
2,NOISY!,"This is a decent product, fairly sturdy in construction, cheap, and requires no assembly. That being said - it is way, way too loud to be enjoyable for me. I live in a small apt, so I worry about the noise the neighbors have to hear. If neighbor noise is not an issue for you, might be ok. But even without considering the neighbors, this thing is so loud that i can't hear the tv or stereo while riding. Just not a pleasant experience. Also, I found that the level of resistance was insufficient at any gear - it is possible that with some adjustment it would be better, but I haven't gotten that to happen. Also - you will definitely need to purchase a stabilizer for the front wheel - and I recommend getting a good one that is heavy enough to actually stabilize the bike. Last thought - though it requires no assembly, attaching the bike can be kind of tough, and you will likely need a partner to hold the bike while you do so. Another negative for me."
4,Bell Motivator Mag Indoor Bicycle Trainer,"This product was everything that I expected. fast and easy connection.The price was the lowest around,thanks to Amazon.com"
2,Not bad for the price,"I bought this item so I could continue riding my bike through the tough Chicago winters. I had no idea it was going to be SO LOUD! I live in a condominium, and after the first day of using this product, I got a ""not so friendly"" visit from the people who live downstairs. Before long, I also got the same type of visit from several other neighbors. After about a week, this item went into storage. I probably should just sell it, because as long as I live in this condo, I won't be able to use it, because of the noise.The item works well, it's just extremely loud. I suggest not getting it unless you live in a house. It makes it very difficult to listen to music while riding too."
2,"Dangerous, Stupid, Lazy Manufacturer","The Bell Motivator Mag Indoor Bicycle Trainer arrived in record time - less than 2 days. Brought it in and opened it. Nearly cut my hand when I removed the bubble wrap which was taped around the trainer. The manufacturer used 2 pieces of scrap metal as spacers where the magnetic unit fits on the frame of the trainer. These pieces of steel are razor sharp,seriously, and they protrude, making them a serious hazard. I was lucky. Someone else will not be. This is a lawsuit waiting to happen. Not sure if you will be able to get to it, but I did upload a picture I took onto the packaging feedback section. Unfortunately, I couldn't put a picture here."
4,. . . gets the job done.,"if you're like me, you are not a big fan of stationary exercise bikes, which are overpriced in my opinion & still have a fondness for your old mountain bike. this particular trainer was on the low end pricewise but still manages to achieve what it's set out to do. lightweight with adjustable resistance & takes less than five minutes to mount any size bicycle onto it. if you are a little cash strapped,in need of an excercise bike for working out or rehabbing & cannot ride your bike the conventional way for whatever reason, then this is a sound investment."
3,Bell Motivator,"The product arrived quickly with only one problem keeping it from a four or five star rating. One of the inside adjustment knobs was broken when I got it out of the box. There was no letter or information enclosed that indicated who to call in case of a problem and no warranty information. The rest of the construction appears sturdy and can be used without this item so i reluctantly decided to just deal with it though it was a disappointment. It is quite noisy when used, but I do have a knobby tire on which accounts for that. Its the only one I have ever used so I cant compare though for the price it seems to be good value. Shame they don't do better quality control when packing for shipment."
5,Excellent support.,"Great with my bicycle, I was able to turn my bicycle into a stationary bike because of this. This item is virtually indestructible. Its still in great condition after a year, I love it."
3,Good value but loud,"This is a really decent trainer for the money. Set-up is a breeze and the trainer is incredibly stable. The main issue I have with it is the noise, I bought this one as I wasn't sure how serious my cycling was going to get and didn't want to pony up for a fluid trainer. This thing sounds like a vacuum cleaner from hell, terribly loud and it feels like it vibrates the floor in my apartment despite the fact that it is sitting on a doubled over yoga mat. This is being used with a road bike so the tires are not knobby and creating noise, the trainer is simply loud as mag trainers are known to be. If noise is not an issue for you this is a great buy, for my situation it just didn't work out."
4,Good Unit,"Bought this for the wife and I to keep tuned in on our bikes during the bad weather. Seems pretty sturdy, ready to Go right out of the box, just unfold and mount the bike and ride. Does not give a lot of resistance, but does what it designed to do. That is the only thing I was slightly disappointed with it on. I thought when I was in the highest gear I could get some good hill like strength work but it does not. It is mainly good for the cardio end and keeping your body conditioned for your bike.FYI... You may need to use the axle that comes with it as I did... My wife's axle is compatible with the mount lugs on the trainer but my Vuelta axle was not."
2,LOUD,If you have road/ mountain bike --dont buy it - it is SO loud- difficult to get the resistance right - and is just too loud. Definitely not worth the money
4,Excellent Jazz-Rock Fusion,"Jazz-Rock with a muscular edge, featuring Jan Hammer on keyboards and synthesizer soloing and as the composer of several excellent tunes. Jan Hammer fans will certainly want to add this surprise gem to their collection."
2,Elvin + Jan Hammer = Bad Chemistry,"Let me set the record straight; I love Elvin Jones, and his drumming has inspired me in many ways. That said, his decision to team up with prime fusion schockmeister, Jan Hammer (most famous for performing the Miami Vice theme and recording overblown albums with Neal Schon and Jeff Beck) was a poor one. This album contains all the trappings of the worst fusion albums of the era: noisy synths, tuneless tunes, and tedium galore."
4,Super Sexy Android,This anime isnt bad its short and seems in complet ive found clips hear and there that show theres more to the story but so far no luck on finding the rest of the anime its still worth watching but this volume 1 stops short jusst when the story start to take off.
2,I am quite dissatified,"this was my first knee pads and i did not like them. they constantly slide down my legs,and made me sweat."
1,Not worth the high cost!,"I purchased the Patella T knee pads for tile installers, finishers, and maint. personel hoping to find a good pad that offered protection and did not constantly slide down my legs, and after wearing them for a week, I have retired them to the tool box. The only way to keep the knee pads up is to strap them on very tight, causing enough discomfort behind my knees that I have to loosen the straps. When I kneel down, most of the time the pads shift over to the side leaving my knees exposed. Add to this the fact that the pads are almost three times heavier than my old knee pads, and the spandex material really makes me sweat. I know that good quality tools and equipment usually costs more, and I have no problem spending money on products I use daily in my business. I felt compelled to write a review about this product because I am quite dissatified, and I bought these knee pads based on the positive customer reviews. I hope this review will be helpful to you."
1,Pads someone's pocket,"Fluid Forms 1002F Patella T knee pads are one of the most disappointing purchases I have made. The pads slide from side to side and slip top to bottom. Because I am on a fixed income I try to purchase the ""best"" but I sure was fooled this time. In addition to crawling around alot, I also fall often due to MS and I count on knee pads to take some of the impact. My previous pair of twenty dollar pads peformed vastly better. Someone send postage and you can have them. Me, I'm headed for town to buy another twenty dollar pair."
1,Patella Pain Pads,"I am an avid weekend carpenter and like to wear knee protection to help save wear and tear on my knees. I recently wore out a $17 pair of basic knee pads from my local supply store. I had heard about these Patella pads and thought I'd give them a try. They are pricey, but if comfortable, that would be OK. I have to tell you that these pads have a serious design flaw. The gel pads do not stay in position during use. The strap system they have looks great with nice velcro strips, but they are not effective in holding the pads in place. Plus, the abrasion on the back of your legs is more painful that not wearing knee pads at all. Save some cash and buy the G3 Ultra gel pads, or the basic $17 ones from HD, both are far better than these Patella pads."
1,very weak kneepads,"The ""gel"" in these kneepads is a joke. Within 20 minutes of wearing them while installing hardwood flooring, the gell was all squished to the edges of the insert and I might as well have had no knee pads on at all. The outter shell/holder was an acceptable device once I removed the gel pads and inserted a piece of firm closed cell foam (from a gardeners kneeling pad)"
3,must be something better,"haven,t had alot of experience with different kneepads .this pair is probale close to a year old .the velcro straps are losing there grab .the jell insert slides to where it is not needed .i do not know if it can be done but it would be nice to have a pair that could stay up .this pair slides down to my ankles quikly .i do wear them often and i sure appreciate them when i do not have them"
5,Ebbie,"I taped Ebbie years ago (with commercials) but we have watched it so often the tape is getting worn out. This is a great version of Dicken's Christmas Carol and Susan Lucci is perfect for the part. Please consider putting this on DVD. Susan has so many fans, I'm sure this wonderful Christmas movie would sell well. Thanks"
5,totally love it!,U just have to release this on dvd! It would be such a shame for it not to be on dvd.
5,Ernest Scared Stupid,"Good ""scarey"" movie for 7 -10 year olds. Watched it years ago on television with my eldest child and bought it on Amazon for my youngest who had never seen it. CD was of a very good quality and I'm pleased with my purchase"
3,Ernest Scared Stupid,"The Ernest movies are truly stupid - but my husband,12 yr old daughter and 10 yr old son LOVE them....."
2,Ernest Scared Boring,"Everything in this film is forced,tired & even unpleasant. It's the weakest of the films. It's pretty forgettable aside Eatrha Kitt's over-acting. Jim Varny was at least trying but he just needed better direction. Overall,it is a bad combo of boring & unpleasant. Almost as boring as The Pagemaster & almost as unpleasant as See Spot Run. I give this film a 3 out of 10."
1,Stupid,"Poor recreation of Killer Klowns from outer space. Watch both movies, you'll see what I mean! This was the worst copycat movie ever. He copied off another movie on Ernest Goes to Jail and Ernest Goes to Camp but dang, this is the worst! It's also gross and I wouldn't let my Children watch it."
5,Ernest whats not to love,"Who doesn't love Ernest, and this halloween thriller is sure to please any kid with it's silliness. Eartha Kitt is always great"
3,Typical Ernest,"Good for nostalgia, I remembered it being funnier. If you like Ernest movies, you'll like this one. Ernest is a divisive figure and you either love him or hate him. Not as good as Ernest goes to prison."
4,Spooky fun for everyone!,"Ernest protects the whole town from an invasion of trolls in this movie. I've loved it since I was a kid and watch it again every year. It always makes me smile and I'm always glad I pulled it out to watch again. Slapstick, good-hearted and ultimately with a nice message as well. Hope you all enjoy this movie!"
3,"Good fun, silly, well produced","This movie is good because it has Jim Varney in it. I would not rate it a 5-star or even 4-stars because it just doesn't rise to that level, but nevertheless it is a good, funny film with a cheap monster-movie quality to it that is appealing. Jim Varney made funnier films in his day than this, but if you love Ernest, don't miss this one. Ertha Kitt plays a crazy old lady in this somewhat memorable performance. 3.5 stars."
5,GREAT MOVIE,Buy this movie. It will be worth every penny you spend. It is a good mixture of scaryness and comedy.
5,I want it...,"I had Prof Beswick for a Non-Western History class (Hist 198). She knows what she's talking about, in fact, it's hard to keep up at times. I wish it weren't so expensive so I could buy it. I'd love to read it."
3,A Romance Thriller!! A 3 1/2 Star Movie!!,"Inspector Lau (Chow) meets Cher(Chung) while investigating a murder and he ends up falling for her. But he than finds out that her estrange husband wants her back. Meanwhile, Lau trys to take down an underworld Kingpin, which leads to a climactic ending. This movie is good. It's a little less violent than other Ringo Lam movies but it still has action with a little added romance."
4,really touches your heart,"generally an above average movie, except for the most touching scene in the movie where the grandfather punishes the little girl by hidding her behind bundles of dried twigs(tree branches used for firewood) and locking her in the barn all for just crying. watch it and you will realise the subtleties of human emotions."
4,The booth? She showed you the booth? lol!,"I liked it. But I like most Christmas themed movies. With Courtney B Vance and Denzel Washington in it how bad can it be? Whitney Houston couldn't act her way out of a paper sack, but she has a beautiful singing voice which added a lot to the movie. But Jenifer Lewis absolutely stole the show! I'm such a huge fan of hers. What bugs about the story line is that while Henry's got the weight of the world on his shoulders, and is single handily trying to hold the entire community together, all Julia can do is complain that she's not getting enough attention. While Henry is trying to get an innocent boy released from jail and trying to save the church the best way he knows how, without any help from Julia. She's off ice skating with Dudley. Going off to sing at Jazzies with Dudley. Having lunch with Dudley and getting her finger poked by a tree, with Dudley. Seems to be she could have been more of a help to her husband."
3,Great family Christmas movie,"This is one of those very rare movies that I love to watch over and over - along the lines of ""It's A Wonderful Life"". In this time of movies with extreme violence, sex, and foul-mouthed teens, this movie is a welcome relief, and one I can watch with my 10 year old daughter. It has a kind of old-fashioned appeal, and wonderful music. I highly recommend it for a family Christmas movie."
2,"""PREACHER'S WIFE""should be stoned""!","if you're expecting alot of ""rock church rock"" then buy the cd which is everything this dvd is not!huston held so much promise as an actress in ""bodyguard"" and is just shamful what dull as dirt this presentation is with the exception of one song.she is made to drag along in this character as a long suffering wife who repeats one time too many ""that's ok,baby""to her children.but what is shamful is the washington character,a black ""angel"" who falls in love with her..we all know black angels will do such things,while making the world ""right""for her preacher husband.what is that about?the director had two lovely actors in this mess and failed to make what could have been a really exciting film with much christmas joy that the cd delivers.ho-hum..get the cd instead!IT ROCKS!"
3,"Nice Try, But Misses The Target...","Let me say right off...Whitney Houston is, without question, an extraordinarily gifted singer and Denzel Washington is one of Hollywood's best boxoffice draws...and, not without reason. But, those facts aren't enough to save this picture.Those who have seen this film and have not seen its predecessor, ""The Bishop's Wife,"" have only seen the inadequate imitation. There is no comparison between the two, other than plot similarities.If you want a beautiful bit of Christmas drama, a touch of humor and truly superb acting, the better choice is ""The Bishop's Wife."" I don't say that merely because it is a ""classic,"" but because of the reasons that make it a classic. The texture of the story and the subtle acting nuances add a richness to the film which is, unfortunately, missing from this updated version."
1,Blu-ray that doesn't play in a Blu-ray Player,This Blu-ray disc won't play. I tried this disc in BOTH of my Blu-ray players and no go! Guess it didn't work out for me.
4,"Great movie, and a much better remake.","Fine and uplifting remake has everything going for it. A great leading man (Denzel Washington) and a great cast of characters that will lift your sprits when you are down. Great support is giving by Courtney B. Vance and Whitney Houston, and the soundtrack by Miss Houston is simply amazing. See it, and let a smile come a cross your face."
5,Great Christmas movie and music,"I'm fond of the original of this film; ""The Bishop's Wife"". But, contrary to your own reviewer, I think this film is just as good, and an excellent update with lively gospel/jazz musical score. Ok, it may be too sweet for some people. But the cast does a great job with the material, which is clean, non-violent comedy focused on family values and which sends you out with your feet tapping to a great jazz rendition of ""Joy to the World""."
3,Movie Great DVD poor quality,"I purchased the DVD and loved the movie and the acting but the sound quality is poor. To hear the movie conversation you have to turn up the volume really high but when the singing starts it will blow you out of the room. I am curious is my DVD messed up or is it all the DVD's. But the movie is so sweet, I loved it."
4,loved it,"Love this movie, and Most of all We Love Whitney Houston. And the cast was Terrific also. Love, Love Love!!!"
1,Not Satisfied,"I was not satisfied with the product I received because I cannot use it. For some reason inside the the normal case of ""The Preachers Wife"" was a foriegn copy. I don't know what part of the world it was intended for, but it would not even play. It said that it was the wrong region. I wrote back to Movie Mars, and I never heard back from them. I don't have an address to send it back to."
5,A Prayer Answered,I love this version of the Bishops Wife.Who doesnt love Denzel and Whitney is at her best in this movie!!She truely is a Star in heaven!I watch this movie after I watch the Bishops Wife with Carey Grant!
4,The Preacher's Wife,"This is an excellent movie for people who like Denzel Washington or Whitney Houston. Also, great for music lovers - there is memorable gospel music in it that I continue to listen to on CD 14 years after the movie first came out!"
4,A Christmas Favorite,I put this movie on my Christmas must do list every year. It's a very good family movie with a great message of hope.
5,"One of the best ""feel good"" family movies of all times","This movie is perhaps one of the best family films of all times. It is beautifully casted with Whitney Houston as ""The Preacher's Wife"" and Denzel ""Dreamboat"" Washington as Dudley the angel. The movie moves along smoothly and brilliantly. And there is such a good message in it. Definitely a film for the whole family to watch. The film gives you hope and you end up feeling really good about life. Give it a try, no disappointments here."
5,Lovely Hikes,"Most of the hikes in this book are simple hikes as well, so it is great if you have children with you. The book also serves as a reference guide for the different flowers you will see on your hike. The book shows the best time of year to hike the particular trails in correspondence with when the flowers are in bloom. Nice book to have on hand."
5,Excellent Pick!,I use this pick exclusively. The thumb indention and the tapered point are just right.
4,"Dunlop 475 Big Stubby Guitar Picks, 1.0MM 6-Pack","The Dunlop 475 Big Stubby Guitar Picks, 1.0MM 6-Pack has beveled edges that are excellent for pinch harmonics, pick tapping and sweep picking. If you are a grip and rip, thrash metal, rhythm player or smooth jazzy kinda player. I can't see where these picks would not fit in your playing style. Dunlop sells these in different thickness if you prefer the thinner sizes. The 1.00mm size are red in color nice for when you drop your pick. You can see it on the floor. The only thing knit-picking observation is they are 4.80 for a 6 pack, that is .80 cent for 1 pick. Losing one these suckers might set you back as much as a meal deal at your favorite fast food places that we struggling musician are force to eat at! I like them, I would love them if they were cheaper!"
1,Not what I was looking for....,"I have a Stanley garage door and this was the only Stanley weahterseal I can find over the internet. But the product description given was not very clear, specially the shape of the seal. The image was not very clear either. I took a chance and it did not turn out to be what I was looking for!"
3,"Watch was nice, nothing special","I ordered this watch for my wife based on the photo. It was shippedpromptly and looked O.K., but nothing special. My wife like it althoughI didn't sense excitement when I gave it to her."
1,Item not received,We still have not received this item. It was ordered more than a month ago. Is there anyway of knowing the status?
1,Poor quality.,I have purchased Oneida before and never have they rusted. Within a few washes several pieces have rust. Buyer beware!!!!!!!
3,You get what you pay for,"BUYER BEWARE! These are being offered at a low price because they are actually 18/0 stainless steel, not 18/8 as Amazon specs incorrectly state.The numbers 18/0 and 18/8 refer to the percentage of content of chromium and nickel. To be classified as stainless steel, the metal must contain at least 11% chromium (no nickel required). Stainless steel used in cookware is normally 18% chromium and 8% to 10% nickel.Low end stainless steel cookware, mixing bowls, stockpots and accessories are usually 18/0, which are usually not highly polished, and could be subject to some rust spotting."
2,Box says 18/0 not 18/8,"I ordered this set because Amazon specs say it's 18/8 steel. However, when I received it, the box says 18/0 which is much lower quality. The pieces look really nice, and I wonder if maybe the box is wrong. Can't know so I'm sending it back."
4,More Silverware,I need more silverware. Got tired of washing them everyday when all of them got dirty. Pattern is a little different from the one I bought years ago - mainly the knives - but not that noticable. Make sure you clean the knives - during the manufacturing process there is some black stuff in the creavices of the teeth.
2,The name is the same but the design has changed.,"This Oneida ""Colonial Boston"" seems like good silverware, but it isn't close to the same design that we bought in 2002. The silverware we were trying to add to is Oneida's ""Colonial Boston"". Apparently, since Oneida shipped production out of the US, they have changed their patterns. I am very disappointed in Oneida."
1,Nothing like the same model manufactured in the USA.,"Shows a simple product, nothing like the same model I bought 3 years ago, not manufactured in the U.S.. Oter shape does not look the same as the original product previously manufactured in the USA. Looks completely different,"
2,"Okay silverware, but they don't do well in the dishwashwer","My husband and I received these as a wedding gift. We love the simple design and weight of the utensils. However, after putting them in the dishwasher a few times we started to notice rust spots. We could buff them out, but who has time to do that every month?"
5,PERFECT SET,I WAS SO HAPPY TO SEE THESE ON AMAZON..I HAD THIS SET YEARS AGO AND SO MANY PIECES DISAPPEARED..NOW MY SET IS MORE THAN COMPLETE AND AT A GREAT PRICE.
1,Not typical Oneida quality- Rust and unfinished edges on handles,"Despite some of the negative reviews, I decided to try this set since it still has a 4 star rating and it matches my Oneida set that I bought only 7 years ago.However, this set I just received is horrible!I washed the utensils once in the dishwasher, and after one day I noticed RUST on the knife handles.The knife handles don't match the earlier version exactly- as one reviewer already mentioned.The utensils are lighter and thinner in the handle (if you had purchased these a few years back)And the edges and bottoms of the handles felt like they still needed to be filed down- which made them feel even more cheap.Super disappointed and returning today."
2,Rust and tarnish already,"I've always loved Oneida flatware. Our last 2 sets began to show signs of age... after 15+ years. To replace them, I ordered 2 of this set on April 30, 2011, less than 2 months ago. A few weeks after we received the shipment we noticed areas of rust on the knife handles and tarnishing on the knife blades. Amazon policy says it requires original packaging for returns, which we didn't retain, so we are stuck with flatware that is embarrassing to have on our table.Oneida Colonial Boston 45-Piece Stainless-Steel Flatware Set, Service for 8"
2,Rusted - again,"I received this flatware as a wedding gift back in 2010. It was purchased at a nationwide retailer. I washed it in the dishwasher and it rusted within a month. I later returned the flatware, and eventually ordered it againt through Amazon a little over a month ago. I washed the flatware ONE TIME in my dishwasher, and again, it rusted. This time it was about half the butter knives, last time it was a little more. I am very disappointed in this product, and surprised this is an issue coming from Oneida. I will not be trying to get this pattern again.I gave it two stars rather than one because I really do like the pattern, and I surmise that if I kept returning the offending pieces to Oneida I'd eventually get a non-rusted set.(As an aside, despite being more than 30 days since my order, Amazon is providing me with a full refund, which I appreciate. The retailer did the same despite my return 6 months after purchase. So, at least they've been great!)"
1,DO NOT BUY ONEIDA STAINLESS,.Real stainless steel is supposed to not rust. This product rusts because Oneida replaced the old 18/10 stainless with El Cheapo 18/0 (read the other reviews here).
3,Not good quality,"I thought these were so nice when they first arrived, they look great, and seemed to be of good quality. After a couple weeks I have noticed the knives are starting to rust. I am extremely upset by this, Oneida is a well known brand, and this is very disappointing. The rest of the pieces are fine, but the whole idea of getting new silverware is having everything match, and I wouldn't let guests use these knives. I will not be purchasing Oneida again"
1,Poor Quality Flatware,The set tarnished after the first dish washing cycle. We are returning the set to Oneida. We are disappointed that Oneida would sell such poor quality flatware. Our next flatware purchase will be 18/10 instead of 18/0. We learned the hard way; hopefully you won't have too.
2,NOT PLEASED,I purchased this to add to the Colonial Boston set that I had from years back. However upon arrival I noticed that it is 18/0 not 18/8 and that the knives do not match the old set. Upon calling Oneida they were willing to replace the knives that I had with the new design free of charge. This would have been satisfactory had I not noticed rust spots all down the handles of the new set. I am currently seeking my money back from either Oneida or Amazon who listed it as 18/8 not the cheaper 18/0 and had a picture of the old style knives.
4,Pricing,"Seemed like a good price until I checked Oneida, on sale for $49.99. How about a little better pricing Amazon. 12-7-2009"
3,3 hours is not enough for over 120 years,"Don't let me put you off by only giving this DVD 3 stars, It is a very good DVD, but the 3 hours may seem a lot to a few people but it only seemed to brush over a lot of the history. For someone has been watching and loving Manchester United for the last 20 years, there just wasn't enough on the field action, even the Treble year was not more than a few goals, I know you have to cut a lot out to fit to three hours but maybe they could have split it into more than one DVD. But saying that I still liked it as a documentary...... But I need more Action!!!"
3,Too much commercialism,"This DVD is seems like a huge plug for Guitar Center merchandizing who is attributed with all of the back sets. I don't mean to sound too negative, half of the performances are worth watching, the other half doesn't entertain me.I am not a Steve Vai fan, the man thinks that he is a model image like Derik Zoolander (Ibanez guitar ads). He takes credit for organizing this, but he is not a blues person, his performance reminds me of Michael Jackson with the fan blowing, I was expecting him to do the moonwalk and one glove. Steve Vai is a sell out. He personifies everything that Frank Zappa hated. Punky Meadows lives on. If Steve Vai had any real talent, he would have done an authentic blues tribute, instead of an opportunist showing-off his skills. Pretentiousness personified.Hats off to Eric Clapton. His intentions are very sincere."
1,Dissapointed Viewer,I bought two copies of this from the Eric Clapton website (shipped from Warner Home Video). Both copies were bad on disc 2 starting at about chapter 20. I rented a copy from Netflix and got the same thing. It would be a wonderful disc set to purchase if it weren't flawed from the factory. Warner Home Video would not replace or refund since I had made my purchase over 30 days ago. Tell me how to buy in time for Christmas and then know within 30 days if the DVD is defective. I love Eric Clapton but his wonderful name was used to rip me off.
2,Disappointing....,I was in Dallas for this concert and I have to confess theDVD is rather disappointing to me. Since I'm more inclinedto Jazz/Blues it was sad to see Pat Metheny and the B.B Kingleft out. I understand they may not have reached a deal butstill it is a pity. Also the participation of other names such asJohn McLaughlin is minimal.I'm selling my copy...
3,Vince Gill Was AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I was lucky enough to see this show & talk to Larry Carlton, Neal Schon, Steve Vai,Jedd Hughes, Tony Franklin & Andy Timmons. Great live show & GREAT DVD!!!! I think Vince Gill was STUNNING. Larry Carlton & Steve Vai had great sets too. I watched Clapton standing right next to Eric Johnson who had a mind blowing set an the day before the huge Cotton Bowl show. I also got to meet Clapton at the very end of Vince Gills' set as Eric walked over to thank Vince."
4,Eric Clapton - CrossRoads,"Nice video and plenty long. It was a great concert, and the quality of the recording is supremo, especially if you play it through a HD upconverting player and watch it on a HDTV. Absolutely brilliant video and sound!!!The only thing that is keeping me from giving it 5 stars is simply prejudice - I am a classical guitarist and there was not a single classical player in the entire concert. There was a sitar player who played on forever - please stop already!!! AND that's NOT a guitar! It's a SITAR! Not even a hint of a classical guitarist. But, nonetheless, it's very entertaining, and the concert was for a very good cause - help for drug/alcohol abuse."
4,This is a great DVD,This is very interesting. I did not know much of Eric Clapton until recently. But I have grow to really enjoy his music.
5,It doesn't get any better than this!,I love to see and hear top notch guitar playing by the true masters of Blues and Rock&Roll. Eric Clapton is one of the very best and he has gathered together an amazing group of guitar players who created and played the music from the early days to the present. I can't recommend this DVD any higher. It's a must have so get it today.
1,Received incorrect DVD and was never able to resolve the problem,"Instead of the Eric Clapton Crossroads DVD, I received Casino Royale. I contacted the seller via the prescribed e-mail channel and was never able to get a response. I did not want to waste more time on it, but getting a movie I already owned was of no value. I will not shop here again."
4,Almost There,"I was fortunate to have attended the June 6 concert with my son. It was a phenomenal experience. The DVD is pretty good. The performances included on the DVD are all good. I would have just a few comments. Jeff Beck, Pat Methany, Neal Schon, and Clapton's performances of Layla and Wonderful Tonight are not included. These were also great, especially Layla. Also, some of the commentary between numbers overlaps onto the next performance (specifically Robert Lockwood's). I think the DVD is very good but could have included more. The first disc is only about 93 minutes--another 30 to 60 minutes could easily have been added. Those who attended would probably have preferred a ""box set"" with every performance included. This said, if you like these artists, the DVD is a must have."
5,perfect guitar mix,"eric clapton must be applauded for bringing together such a wonderful mix of guitar styles. unfortunately a few blowhards like harry tennech would rather hear himself spout off than appreciate how good these guys are. david hildago plays a wonderful guitar solo on neighborhood, great licks and super guitar tone, and b.b king in his prime was as good as anybody, oviously mr.tennech has never heard live at the regal.this dvd is a lovefest of respect from great guitarist all over the world and i highly recommend it."
3,Where are all the great songs??????,"G.Bohn got it right with his review. Very dissapointed with the song selection. Many songs were left out of the Saturday night blues spectacular. Every song gave me chills that night. Robert Randolph was absolutely amazing on a couple of songs that were left out. Jeff Beck's performce was one of the best Sunday night. You could hear a pin drop throughout the song. Simply amazing and yet it was left out. Two songs by Vince Gill and only one by Santana. And this was a guitar festival? Needleass to say, this DVD set could have been significantly better. I only hope the rest of the material is released soon."
4,Jeff Was Missing,"There were a few guitarist that should have not been omitted from this DVD set, who played at the Festival. The Most disappointing omission was JEFF BECK!! He should have been on this DVD as well. There is not enough product of Jeff on DVD for us Beck Fans. All we have is the ARMS Concert and BB King Live by request. I hope Clapton decides to do a Volume 2 of this with the guitarist that were missing from the first set. But I still love seeing Buddy Guy cutting heads on ""Sweet Home Chicago"" (Robert Cray was right..you gotta keep your eyes on Buddy). Joe walsh was at his comic & musical best, playing his hits and commenting on how a song was dedicated to those who never had a song dedicated to them."
1,Beware - Defective DVD's,Amazon won't let you select 0 Stars so 1 is lowest I could select.At least one other reviewer had the same problem as me - Both Discs are UNPLAYABLE in all (4) of the DVD Players I have in my house.I just sent Amazon an E Mail indicating this but I believe their policy is to exchange only - I'll have to wait and see if the replacement is another defective product.Shame on Warner Strategic Marketing for using such Powerhouse Content to Rip people off!!!!!
5,Guitar Fans will like this,"Not just blues or rock and roll, an eclectic blend of musicians, all playing the instrument they love. Good sound and cinematography.Not long enough. Needs to be a 4 or 5 volume collection.Forget ZZ Top."
5,Crossroads Guitar Festival DVD,FANTASTIC....Some of the best music performed by some of the best musicians around. Enjoyed every minute! !
3,"Performance 5 stars, technically 1 star","Love EC, love all the performances. But PLEEEEZE, can anyone tell me why these damn drums allways have to be mixed in so loud? It's a GUITAR thing, remember? Fire the mixing engineer and start over."
3,Nice but could've been better,"I usually try to refrain from negative reviews on musical performances but since everyone is hailing the DVD, I'll add some brief ""shoulda's"" that I would've like to have seen in the DVD...A little too much footage of John Mayer but I guess the producers were hoping to snag the younger crowd.I was also a little disappointed that despite showing Neal Schon on the side of the stage and in a brief interview segment, there is no footage of him playing!!? Would've also liked to have seen Jeff Beck who I understand was there but left out of the final edit. And I concur that there are many other guitarists more worthy than who did make the cut...Di Meola, Knopfler, David Lindley, Betts, Lukather, Coryell...Oh well, maybe on the next DVD."
4,when is part 2 coming out?,"I attended the Crossroads festival on the last day and of course was blown away...I think the most amazing thing I saw was Jeff Beck with Eric Clapton performing ""because we ended as lovers"". Why isn't the most beautiful thing I heard that day on the festival dvd? I believe it's because part 2 is coming...there was plenty of music for a part 2 and probably a part 3 as well.SO...definitely pick this DVD up, but wait patiently for the release of part 2 with me..."
5,buy this if you like rockin blues,"This dvd is another good one video and audio are great and the show is great. this dvd is full of stars and if you like the rockin blues you will love this, buy it you won't be disapointed from person who knows good music dvds I have 75 some good and some bad."
4,Very Entertaining,"First the negatives. I read before I bought this that Clapton and Jeff Beck play with ZZ Top on La Grange, this is not true. Also, there is no footage of Beck at all. Was he even there? Also read John Mayer sat in with Clapton, BB, Vaughn and Guy. Maybe he did but there was no footage included here. Was waiting for Johnny Lang to rip into a solo, never happened. Eric Johnson was surprisingly sloppy at times. Of course his sloppy is still better than most guitarist. I really enjoyed Clapton playing with JJ Cale. I thought that was great. Vince Gill put on a great set also. David Hildago was smoking, great vocals and guitar solos. Clapton playing with Santana was interesting, although Clapton looked lost at times. I guess that will happen during a walk on. I have to say this was worth the money. I can't wait to watch it again."
3,could have been so much better,"I do like this DVD. The sound quality is very good as is the overall production. But I've heard the full concert, which is over 10 hours, and these discs squeeze out only 3 1/2 hours of it. And don't tell me they couldn't fit on any more - the Led Zeppelin 2DVD set has 5 1/2 hours of music! So what do we miss here? - well, Clapton starts with 4 or 5 Robert Johnson songs (not surprising, given his latest album) but the DVD has just one. ZZ Top give a great closing one hour set, but we get just 2 songs here (good ones though) etc etc. Highlights of the DVD include: Eric playing in shorts and sandals, JJ Cale with Eric (superb), Buddy Guy (all too little), Hubert Sumlin, BB King, ZZ Top - and John Mayer turns out some very nice blues licks. I would have liked to see much more of these artists - which space and taste justified - but the proceeds to charity would have remained the same so we get de minimus."
4,Best Jam Ever!!!,"I am always looking out for a good guitar rock and blues jam and this is it. The performers are absolutely incredible, and the sound is terrific. The video production is also great, very good footage from various interesting angles. Good shots of the performers guitar work. Great song selections too. I was a little hesitant at first, but am glad I purchased this video. My teen son also finds this video great too. Leroy"
5,Guitar Special,"Lots of the Greatest Guitar artists, Rock, Blues, Country.Found this set to be great entertainment.A welcome addition to the library."
3,The experience of classic blues clean and sober,"I enjoyed both the disks in the collection. For the first time in my life, I enjoyed this music with which I had grow up, with out the aid of any stimulants in my case the demon fire water. Thus, over all, a different experience. But now when one has reached middle age i e over 50 and one can reflect back and say ""Been there done it and got out"", but, still now get thrilled by these talented people whome we once considered gods."
5,witchy tarot,"I love these tarot cards! I find them very accurate when I am doing readings. I have many decks and this one is going to be one of my faves for sure. I loved witches as a kid and Halloween,and this takes me back to my childhood.Great, fun deck!"
1,This is supposed to be for wiccans?,"this deck is supposed to be geared towards wiccans...and teens. WOW , I don't know about others but it is far from what I would recomend to any begining wiccan no matter their age, complete with flying broomsticks, pointy hats and... GARTER BELTS, these big busted ladies are to busy pulling up their skirts and letting it all hang out to be helping someone focus on a reading! Geared to wiccans, NO... geared towards teenage guys who are interested in rebeling and think wicca is the way to do it..YES! The deck also (trying to be more ""witchy"") changes the basic suites (pentacles, wands, swords, cups) into broomsticks,couldrons,etc.An it harm none, how about considering making a product that teaches respect of others, one that doesn't portray witches as stereotypes OR degrading women!!!"
5,Nice interpretations of great compositions,"This is such a nice album, made with so much respect and 'humilde' for Paulinho's compositions, that it's hard to complain about anything. It's just great to have all these compositions recorded all together; it's a fantastic compendium of all of the beautiful sambas which Paulinho has written over forty years.Teresa Cristina sings well and honestly, and her love and care for the music shines through. No, she's not Paulinho, but it's also nice to hear her ideas about the music. The box set is also nice, because it gives us lyrics for all of Paulinho's music - missing from most of the early albums. The choro accompaniment is just right and well played; nice also to have Paulinho participate himself.I'm still waiting for Paulinho to record this album himself, along with songs from Cartola, Nelson Cavaquinho, Ze Kete, Noel Rosa, Aldir Blanc, Candeia, Portola, and the other sambistas whose songs he sings from time to time . . ."
4,Is as advertised,It looks good. Some reviews say it has problems with the legs staying in. It does. They squeeze right out. They need to be screwed in. They are plastic and look better than the old metal legs.
4,a book looking at the psychology of youth,"Haven't finished it yet, because got it out of the library, but a great book on youth psychology (Kertweil's different levels or stages). I like and agree with the definition of an adolescent: who is a ""young"" adolescent and who is an ""old"" adolescent. So true but also something I never thought about, being an ""old"" adolescent myself. The first section is mostly psychology, which is great if you haven't taken that, or need a review explained in youth ministry terms. There is the note that it is not written by a high schooler or college student, but the author conveys enough as if they were a knowledgable one. Being in ministry with adolescents, I loved what I learned beyond what I already knew about their psychology. Couldn't give it 5 stars however since I haven't finished it yet and don't have time to for a few months."
5,Great African Americans by Taylor Oughton,"Teachers are always searching for something interesting to use for Black History Month. This is it! Writers, doctors, artists, educators, politicians, sports figures, inventors and many more can be found in this interesting coloring book. Under each sketch is a paragraph telling about the individual. My students will enjoy these next September."
2,Text geared to older students,The book arrived in good quality and on time. Not a reflection on the seller at all.The item itself was written for a much older student that would be interested in a coloring book format.I gave it to a fifth grade colleague and she said her kids were completely uninterested in coloring it.
2,Okay,"While I appreciate having a coloring book that highlights black folk, the font for the captions is too small. I have a four-year old and I was looking for something tailored more towards his age group."
4,"Why, oh why, go soft on us now?","I'm a fan of Maggie O'Farrell's and was really looking forward to reading this. O'Farrell has always been about love, but love with a twist of melancholy. In this book, classic romance creeps in a big way and ... for me, part the thrill has gone [soft] for it.The characters in ""The distance between us"" are not as involving and her writing is a lot less dark, losing some of its bite in the process.In summary, this book is still a pretty good read, but it doesn't pack the same punch as some of her previous work (e.g. this is nowhere near as hard hitting as ""After You'd Gone)."
4,Worth getting for No. 13 -- the best I've heard so far.,"Ashkenazy gives himself and the Philharmonia a spirited run through both these scores. No. 13 comes across extremely well, with a robustness and zing in the ""military"" opening by the opening, then a teasing, witty entry by the soloist that develops into a sparkling parformance overall. No. 12 comes across as less personal, more generalized, but is still a brisk performance."
3,It's Good,The cartridge works as it should but cost is still very high. Wish costs would go down but with Lexmark out of the inkjet printer business I expect that the cost for cartridges will go up not down. Guess it's time to look for a new printer.
5,Works great,Was hesitant to order ink online but glad I did and had no issues with the ink. Thanks for your service.
4,Easier than buying at retail store.,"The print cartridge works fine on my Lexmark printer, shipping was quick and price was competitive. I appreciate the chance to return to used cartridge."
1,No customer service,"I received this poultice to remove stains from marble. However, it did not work. I emailed the seller and called for suggestions. I did not receive a response to either. Absolutely no customer service. I do not recommend this seller"
2,"Smoker works, customer service doesn't","The smoker works, but beware of their customer service. I ordered a new heat element for my smoker and after requesting and paying for 2nd day FedEx, they shipped USPS and it took a week to get the element. In addition to the cost of extra shipping I lost two briskets that I purchased prior to finding out the heat element failed. When I called SmokinTex to in inquire of the issue, the response I got was sorry, but nothing we can do.My next smoker will be a CookShack, they have excellent customer service and want to keep their customers. SmokinTex just wants to sell you another smoker."
4,Smokin in Florida...,Have used this smoker now a few times with good results. Easy to use and the final product is delicious. Did a lot of research comparing this to the CookShack models. This smoker is less expensive and likely turns out a product equal to the competition on all levels. I ended up ordering the stand for this model about a week later and though it added to the overall cost it was a necessary addition.
2,"Smoker works, customer service doesn't","I have had a SmokinTex smoker for years and while the smoker does the job, my heat element went out. I ordered a new one from SmokinTex and requested (and was charged) for FedEx 2 day delivery as I had briskets already purchased when the element went out. When the element didn't arrive, I called, they decided to send it USPS as they estimated two day delivery. Not what I requested and paid for. It took a week for the element to arrive, the briskets were lost. When I called SmokinTex to inquire, they said sorry, but not their problem. When this thing dies, I will be buying a CookShack!"
1,What's so hot?,Every thing I have cooked on this thing is gray. No different than cooking inside in my kitchen oven because that's all it is! I suppose it is OK for someone that does not enjoy cooking. Save your money!!!
5,A great introduction to low-light photography,"This book is split into chapters dealing with different subjects relating to low light photography. All the chapters are easy (and fun) to read, and the pictures are great. But what I like best about this book is that it will give you very specific advice. It's not some dull, try-until-you-get-it-right advices, but it will tell you exactly which aparture and shutter speed to use in a given situation. Why doesn't everybody do it this way?"
2,complete waste of time,"Very little value even for a novice. Amongst the meandering ramblings which filled the sparsely illustrated book up to the publisher's quota of words, I managed to glean 2 important pieces of information: Tripods are important, and you can use a bean bag to steady your camera. Everything else was filler. Oh! and don't forget to steady your camera. Duh!"
5,Digital Photography - Instruction,Whether a novice or with experience this book provides invaluable insights in achieving excellent results for pictures taken in low light or night conditions. It saves a lot in the trial and error department.
5,I love this book....,"It is well writen, not to basic or technical - just right. I found it helful and informative."
1,for beginers only,this book is for someone who doesn't know how to use a releas cable and a tripod. it's not for pros or even semi proffesionals.
3,"Technical parts are short, but good compositional ideas","From a technical standpoint, Frost is rather brief, but I think that his overall treatment of the subject is good. As other reviewers noted, there are other, more detailed books on the technical details of low light photography. What the book does a good job of doing, I think, is letting you into the mind of someone who has taken some wonderful lowlight shots. The thread of compositional advice that is interwoven with the technical advice made this book worth it for me."
3,Excellent but dated,"I found the material very helpful and the concepts straight forward with plenty of example photo. The only downside is that the book is dated and tends to talk about digital photography as some futuristic, yet un-refined, technology."
3,Not so informative,I was expecting a bit more from this book. Im just a beginer but I already knew about the things he was talking about. Also his tips and tricks weren't all the greatest. There's better books with better prices that will give you better info than this book.
4,Great book if you know the basics..,"The book is good if you have a little bit of understanding of photography - i.e. understanding of aperture, shutter speed etc.Then this book will give you a lot of good tips on how to make better photographs. If you are a rank beginer trying to understand photography then I won't recommend this book.Intially I learnt a lot of stuff from the internet, but then when I read this book it defineitly improved my photography skills in low light conditions."
2,Very dated,I bought this without looking inside and found that many references are for film camera and terms do not indicate what you would find on today's digital cameras.
3,"Good book but I wouldn't call it the ""complete"" guide",I especially like the sample photos...great examples of what you can do in low light. The time of day and camera setting suggestions are helpful. I wouldn't call this complete because it's still a bit too high-level. It's a good start though to get you started but practice is the only way to really understand what settings work when. If you're looking for something more advanced you'll get through this book quickly and still want more.
5,Clarifying my ideas.,"This book is the most amazing and wonderful book I have read in ages. Arthur Clarke clarifies my thoughts on religion and many other ideas that I have had for a very long time. I was brought up in a very strict christian home by my widowed mother and although she did her best for me, for which I am very grateful, her religion and her church left me with a load of old baggage which I am now just starting to get rid of. I am 66 years of age and love this book."
4,Good product for the cheap price :),This is a great product for a unique sound to your vehicle... LOVE it and the price.. plus fast shipping!
4,A Good Analysis of President Wilson's Views,"To End All Wars attempts to show where President Wilson's ideas on the League of Nations came from and why he ultimatly failed. A fascinating protryal of early 20th century poltics, Knock successfully intergrates both the domestic policies of Wilson with his international policies. The links between the progressive, pacifist leagues and Wilson's views are clearly marked and appear credible. What is not examined is the moral conflict between Wilson's anti-war views and the fact he lead the country into World War I. Further research into this inconsitency could have led insight into why Wilson treated his former progrssive allies with such contempt as the war progressed. The ultimate result was his political inability to convince the American people to join the League of Nations after he alientated his greatest supporters."
4,Woodrow Wilson and the League of Nations,"This book is about Woodrow Wilson's quest for a new world order during and after WW I, especially his strong desire for the creation of a League of Nations which would mediate all future disputes between nations. The U.S. Senate, of course, voted it down. I found it interesting how the country (and Wilson) had strong socialist leanings, especially in international affairs, until War was declared in 1916, when a huge reaction took effect. Knock does a good job relating events and portraying Wilson as one whose ideas for truly ending warfare was convincing to world leaders but not his own country. The effort of trying to persuade his countrymen of the importance of a League probably broke his health and led to his death. Recommended."
1,"Too flashy, not musical",My title says it all. There's no beauty in this performance -- it's like a movie which has been changed from an interesting character-driven plot to become an action thriller with a car chase. Yuck!
1,Disappointment,This pipe was a disappointment. First the good parts. It is made from a nice piece of wood and looks pretty impressive at 27-28 inches. I got this for a prop to take to renaissance faires. The reed is plastic and it does actually make a sound. That's about it. There was no manual to describe how it is supposed to be played. The holes are small and uniformly drilled. It does not play according to any type of scale that I recognize although it is possible to adjust the pitch of the notes by changing your breath pressure or fingering to try to approach a scale. The lower notes are especially prone to pitch variation due to pressure changes. The biggest problem with this is the tone. The instrument is much quieter than a recorder or a penny whistle. It does not make much sound. It looks rather nice and it does make sounds but it is not really worth the price for basically a prop.
4,Good general overview,This book gives the highlights of 7 political classics and the philosopher's intent for writing them. They also give an analysis as to what relevance the writings have. Not bad but could have been more in depth.The works include:Plato: The RepublicAristotle: The PoliticsSaint Augustine: The City of GodNiccolo Machiavelli: The Prince and DiscoursesThomas Hobbes: LeviathanJohn Locke: The Second Treatise of GovernmentJean-Jacques Rousseau: The Social ContractI would use this a primer for any serious reading on political philosophy. Each work has a decent selection of further suggested reading.
3,Prose and poetry...,"This first book of prose poetry by Mary A. Koncel is masterfully crafted and mannered. Her surrealistic humor and irreverence reminds me of James Tate’s poetry. The first three sections feel more like prose than poetry, delightfully and deeply noun sensual; sometimes her paragraphs are reminiscent of William Heynen’s gentle yet witty parables."
2,The finish wears off in 6 months,I don't have time to baby my cookware! The pans that I use often worked well for a few months and then I noticed the circles were chipping into my food! My neighbor found the same thing happening with hers! I bought mine in 2001 and now I am looking to replace them!
2,Totally Unacceptable !,"How can you use cookware that you can't get hot??! Want to sear some ahi tuna? Forget it. Cook a large batch of pasta? Have a good book handy while you wait for the water to boil on medium heat! Your cooking times will double, and if you try to rush the process by using high heat you'll end up with cookware that sticks badly.What's next, a Circulon line of stemware that is ruined if you put liquids in them?"
1,Don't see it,"I don't care what Siskel and Ebert say on the front of the box. To say such good things about this movie, they must have been not with it or something. I believe that this film was a great idea and could have been wonderful, but Nolte had to ruin it. He was great in 48 Hours, Another 48 Hours, New York Stories, I Love Trouble, and 3 Fugitives, but what is he doing in this film? Like I said before, don't listen to anything anyone tells you...this film is CRAP!"
5,Funny Movie.,Love Bette Middler. She steals the movie. I could watch this movie often. It has a fast pace and keeps you laughing.
3,Pure 80s,"This is definitely vintage 1980s comedy. The best thing about the movie is how well it captures that decade. For those of who grew up then, it's worth watching for that reason alone. It's also not a bad movie, with some funny scenes and funny acting. However, the movie as a whole falls through the cracks. It's not funny enough to become a classic comedy. Neither its acting nor its plot are particularly compelling. I'd recommend it to fans of 1980s comedies, but you probably won't find yourself watching it more than once."
5,One Great Movie,"I don't know about the reviewer from georgia, but this movie had me in stiches. If good entertainment is what your looking for this is it"
3,A Simple Book,"This book seemed pretty minimal, without much information after reading several other feng shui books. If you haven't read any other feng shui books, it would probably seem more interesting. This is a very light, very simple read, possibly a good gift."
5,Ground breaking,This book breaks new ground in the study of U.S. History by virtue of its focus on how consumerism has shaped not just American spending habits but the very meaning of an American identity itself. Readable and thought provoking I would highly recommend it.
3,Good for a Laugh,"I read this book when I was 11, and it seemed really shocking. Then I found it when I was 35, and read it again.It's the most ridiculous, over-dramatized, fake piece on ""drug abuse"" that I've ever read - it's hilarious! It's like watching ""Reefer Madness.""However, if you're trying to scare a teenager out of trying drugs, I wouldn't give them this book. Unless they're incredibly naive, they're going to see right through it."
3,Pretty good,"Semi-interesting though a bit dated now. I enjoyed ""Fear and Loathing"" a lot more than this book."
5,Review For School Project,"GO ASK ALICE is an extremly powerful book dealing with the trouble a teen faces after being turned down a path of drugs and sex by peer pressure. Alice's diary takes readers into a world few manage to come back from, making this book a good way to show teens what drugs can do to you without them making the mistake on their own. I thought this book was very good and held a good message. It is good for teenagers because it shows the true picture of what drugs will do. It shows the joy she felt while she was high but it also expressed the agony she went through when she wasn't high. Teens can also relate because the book was writen by a real person about the same age. I have read three other books edited by Dr. Beatrice Sparks. Of them, GO ASK ALICE was my favorite. I recommend this book to anyone as a good read that is hard to put down."
1,Use Hemp Rolling Papers instead...,"""Go Ask Alice"" is lousy rolling paper. It's too heavy a stock, and of course the print is questionable.It's really hard to get a good joint made from this paper.And when you smoke it, it's probably the harshest thing to smoke, next to ""Six Crises"" by Richard M. Nixon.On the whole, this book is a poor substitute for hemp rolling papers."
2,"""Logic and proportion have fallen sloppy, dead.""","Other than the cliched drug references, there are so many geographical and factual inaccuracies in this book that it's clear this is not a ""real diary"". Bea Sparks wrote this book and ""Jay's Journal"". There's rumors she was asked by federal authorities to write them to help the anti-drug crusade. Don't lie to kids. Stop the anti-drug paranoia before we get a police state."
3,stickers all over the book,"I received this book in a timely fashion and in good condition for a used book. Unfortunately I was sad to see price stickers all over the book, literally there are 4 and I can't remove them without ruining the cover or binding. If you don't care about that sort of thing then no worries, but personally I am big on aesthetics and this bugged me."
2,Alice,"I enjoyed this book.but, I enjoyed the book Lucy in the sky much better. I suggest reading both books. They have good story lines."
5,Inspiring!,"This book was very real and inspiring. Throughout the book I felt myself rooting for the character's sobriety and well-being. It felt as if I knew her and we were close friends. I often found myself in tears and feeling very sympathetic for the character. I was very disappointed at the end, I also found myself wishing I could meet and connect with the character. I definitely give the book 5 stars. I recommend the book for anyone who is curious about drug use. The book is very real and honest with a lot of gory details from a real drug user. I loved this book!"
5,A Wonderful and shocking novel,"This was certainly a very chilling tale. Especially being an adolescent, it was difficult for me to think of my friends getting into drugs so hard. It is frightening to think that it can happen to anyone, just one little party and your life can spin out of control, even if it was not intentional. Every teenager should read this book. It should help them to have the correct mind set about drugs and how harmful they really are."
4,"An ""ADDICTIVE"" book","Go Ask Alice was a phenomenal story about a young girl's struggle through the world of highly addictive drugs. This book displays how easy it is to enter that world and how hard it is to actually get out of it. I think that this book is very good at portraying the life of this girl. Through out the book you feel as if you are there, actually going through the high's and low's of her messed up drug life. You end up feeling her pain and wanting to help her when she has no one else. While reading this book it seems to take control of you, just as drugs take control of the girl's life. I extremely recommend this highly ""addictive"" page turner to people of all ages, middle school and up. This book will make you look at life in a totally different way. I hope that you enjoy it!"
5,review of Go Ask Alice,"This book was one of the best books I have ever read. The way Alice describes what she see's when she is high is fascinating. I found it interesting that It said on the cover ""A Real Diary"", yet it was filed under fiction in our school library. I have allways wondered what taking all those drugs would be like, and after reading this book you don't need to try it to know what its like. I have talked to people that I know have done it and they say that she describes it exactly how it really is. no author can describe something like that unless they have tried it, so i think that this really was a real diary."
4,Go Ask Alice video and book,Items were just as seller described and was not over priced. Thank you so much.
4,Good and easy read,"I read this book in less than 3 hours. It was an easy read, yet well enjoyed. At the beginning of the first page I felt as if I was Alice's best friend, or better yet, Alice herself. The entries made me feel like I was experiencing was she was going through, and it really made me look at all the things I don't have to go through every day.This was a nice book to if you'd like to read about some of the teenage lives going on around you.The ending was shocking, and it just shows how much she needed her diary to keep her well."
5,14 year old...,"I believe that the book Go Ask Alice was not just great but also inspirational. Having similar problems as ""Alice"" has made it easy for me to relate to this book. Even though I was able to face and fix my problems before it got as bad...it still was a great thing to be able to read and say ""Wow...that was me at one time"". I would recommend for any teens that are at least 14 and older to read this phenominal piece of liturature. Thanks to the author, Beatrice Sparks, for wrting a book with such great meaning."
3,"very down to earth,easy to read","I am a mom of a teenager that used drugs for a year before I knew about it,reading this book helped me to understand what he meant when he said ""they just keep pushing you and pushing untill you give in""and thatwithout a parents love & patience they may give in."
5,a wonderful insight to the teenage mind,"I first read this book my first year of high school. I was experimenting with drugs and I feel that my calling to read this book was a subconsious cry for help. I found myself enthrawled in this book, unable to put it down. It was so real- as if someone had opened up Alice's mind and dumped every thought and emotion onto a piece of paper. I related to every one of Alice's feelings and ideas- the yearning to break free, the new change, the fun.... I also related to the downpull that the drugs caused- in myself and in my friends. The book was cold, hard reality- like a slap in the face that I desparately needed. I gave the book to my sister to read. She had a lot of the same drug problems as me, only worse. After she read it, she wouldn't stop talking about it for days.... and the amazing part was she has never read a book for enjoyment in her life."
4,This book will make you wonder about your life in the future,"Farenheit 451, by Ray Bradbury, is the story of a fireman, Guy Montag, who as a result of his society, burns books for a living. Guy's questioning of his job makes the reader reflect on his or her own life and beliefs. In this post-war future, society has become meaningless and empty because people fell in to what was comfortable ans easy. Books were thought to promote free thinking and unacceptable ideas. This is the tale where uniformity and simple minded ideas dominate the society. The book is very confusing and the end leaves you wondering if someone forgot to print the final page. However, we highly recommend this novel which shows a future which might become our future if we deny books the attention that they deserve."
4,THIS BOOK WILL NEVER GROW OLD,"I AM A 14 YEAR OLD FEMALE WHO WAS ASSIGNED TO READ THIS BOOK BEFORE I ENTERED HIGHSCHOOL . I PICKED UP THIS BOOK AT ABOUT 1:00 IN THE MORNING AND DIDN'T PUT IT DOWN UNTIL 4:00 . I DIDN'T EVEN TAKE A BREAK TO GO TO THE BATHROOM ! . WHEN I SAW THIS BOOK ON MY READING LIST I WAS 100 PERCENT SURE THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE BORING, BUT IT WAS EVERYTHING BUT THAT . NEVER IN MY LIFE HAVE I BEEN MORE TOUCHED BY A BOOK, AND I'VE READ MANY BOOKS IN MY DAY . I FELT TEARS IN MY EYES WHEN I READ OF HER FATE AT THE END .(WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED SHE WAS SO HAPPY.)AFTER READING THIS BOOK I WOULD'NT DARE EXPERIMENT WITH DRUGS . THIS BOOK IS DEFINITELY ON MY TOP 10 LIST . I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE WHITHER THEY DO DRUGS OR NOT ."
5,THIS STORY WAS RADICAL!!,"I thought GO ASK ALICE was a terrific book about a girl who gets involved into drugs and has some consequences. I particularly liked it because it shows you what could happen if you take drugs, and some of the struggles you have to go through with your family and friends. For example she would run away because she was scared of getting caught by her parents so she would always run away. If you think that taking drugs is cool like she thought it was at first I think that you are wrong it messes up your life like it messed up hers. I also think this is a good book because it's a true diary of events that really happened that could happen to anyone at anytime. So I gave this book 5 stars and I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read books that show them the dangers of drugs."
2,go ask who?,"I used to like this book when I thought it was the real diary of a teenage girl who used drugs. Then I found out it was actually written by Beatrice Sparks who has written lots of ""anonymous"" teen diaries. It's not bad to write an anti drug story but tell it like it is. Don't degrade your readers by lying to them. I think anyone who has bought this book should get their money back for false advertising."
1,An Anonymous Author has no integrity,"My local newspaper has a policy for submitting anonymous letters to the editor:""We do not publish anonymous letters"".As far as I know Charles Manson could have authored ""Go Ask Alice"" and lied about every bit of it.A more reputable book for learning about the effects of LSD is ""LSD Psychotherapy"" by Stanislav Grof,M.D. Another good one is ""Marijuana Myths Marijuana Facts"" by Lynn Zimmer,Ph.D and John P.Morgan,M.D. To find out ""true"" stories about how drugs effect most people see ""Saying Yes"" by Jacob Sullum.""Go Ask Alice""is pure fiction.You may find it entertaining and it makes a good movie,but it is not a true story.To claim that is is unethical."
2,BUY ANOTHER BOOK!,"Many people discribe Go Ask Alice as an emotional, touching book that really hits close to home. While this may sound abrasive, I find that people who felt that way were captured by the typical ""I feel sorry for people like that and I'm a humanitarian."" The book was full of whining and unrealistic details. I say unrealistic because it has been revealed that Go Ask Alice is actually a book written by Beatrice Sparks. This book is for the reader intrested in something short but very deep. Everything is mostly straight forward but parts of the story can become very confusing. I did not like the book, but that doesn't mean I'm not a humanitarian."
4,Remember What The Door Mouse Said,"I've just read this book and I'd like to say that I relate to Alice very much. Not that I'm a big drug addict or anything, but that I'm a teenager. I think alot of teenagers feel the same way as Alice and that we all have the oppurtunity to slip into a world of drugs. Some of us more than others and I know I've certainly had the chance and I hope that I never submit to these temptations. The world of durgs that Alice has fallen into is very real to me, I could see myself standing in the shadows with Alice. Usually when I read a book I can envision the room, the people, and every minut detail, but for this book I couldn't. In those respects I didn't feel it deserved five stars. Personally I love to read and feel that every book is worth reading."
4,Had a Good Message,"I thought this book would be more interesting, but then realized that it was a book of journal entries. At first the book made you think that drugs are a good thing. Then her symptoms really burst through. It got kind of boring after she was put in the mental hospital. I do recommend this book, though."
4,Plainly said,Go Ask Alice is a book that tells the truth plain out. You must be a little bit mature to read this or else you won't get the real point. If you are ready to face reality read this book.
4,Go Ask Alice,This book was like no other especially because it was real and it was about a teen girl who got addicted to drugs and with doing that she ran away and did other unethical things. I think this book teaches you what drugs do to you and that when you start you can't quit and when you want to quit you can't and then you wish you could take it back and wish you never started drugs - the things that you think make your life easier and happier but totally mess up your life in the end and can even cause death. This book made a difference in my life especially because where I live I know alot of drug dealers and after reading this book I will never ever do drugs.
5,An Outstanding Book,"Go Ask Alice was a wonderful book about a girl who gets into drugs. You learn about her experiences and the sadness of her situation. I read this book three times, and every time was the same as the first; a truely outstanding book."
3,Eh.,"To me, Go Ask Alice seems more like anti-drug propaganda than a teenage girl's diary; however, it is still an interesting book to read.Go Ask Alice is the (supposedly real) diary of an average, teenage girl who goes askew from her life due to her inadvertantly taking LSD at a party. Basically, she falls into a life of hedonism caused by drugs. She repents from the said hedonism and drugs, unknowlingly eats cookies with LSD in them after her repentence, goes crazy, and is institutionalized because of it. (Do not read the rest if you do not wish to know the ending) Eventually, she gets better, is happy with herself and family, seems to have completely changed, and randomly dies a little while later from a drug overdose.It certainly is an interesting story, and it most likely had some heart warming, Lifetime Original Movie effect on somebody or helped persuade some Joe Crackpipe to try to give up his drug habit (although SHE DIES when she does), but I really doubt that it is true."
4,Go Ask Alice,"Go Ask Alice is happy and sad, funny and serious, and comforting and scary at the same time. It is a true anonymous diary about a 15 year-old girl that is slowly seduced by the world of drugs.The first time she takes a drug is when someone slips LSD in her drink at a party. After that it is all up and down. She runs away two times and when she comes back, with the help of her family, she gets off them. But somehow she is back on them when she runs away again. This story takes place in a variety of locations like San Francisco and Berkeley. This nonfiction is an exciting, quick book that I think everyone should read, only if you're over 13 though, due to some strong language and lots of drug reference, it's more for the mature reader. All in all, this is a really great book that shows you how bad drugs can really be."
5,Really Quite Excellent,"This book is the best and the most convincing source of knowledge about how bad drugs are that I have ever seen or heard. Reading this book was like getting a first hand experience, and every moment I put the book down to do something else, I would just be extremely thankful to God for not making me experience the things in the book. It was excellent. I recommended it to all my friends, and they loved it too. It is not only a great literary experience, but also an excellent learning source."
5,A Great book,GO ASK ALICE is one of the best books I have ever read. It kept me in suspense because I never knew what was going to happen to Alice next. I couldn't put the book down.
1,stupid,"This book is nothing but stupid anti-drug fiction. If you want to see that the biggest problem with drugs is the people against them, or if you are an idiot buy this book."
1,WHICH drugs?,"This book is obviously for teens, because it groups ALL 'drugs' into one big lump; I ask WHICH drugs are on trial here?Is marijuana the same as LSD? Is crack cocaine the same as caffeine?Because something is classified as a 'drug', does that make it unsuitable as a medicine? Are there any beneficial qualities to marijuana? No, just what the government tells us to believe. I would hope that educated adults will see this kind of book as over simplified propaganda, and avoid these generalizations when considering legalizing medicinal marijuana."
1,Go ask mrs Sparks,"When I read this book about in late 90's for community college, I though this was a real story. I am glad to learn she did not die from drug over dose, but dispointed that I was lied by editor possible author. I think good book, but need to be relable as work of fiction and not as fact. One would think publisher would be honest, epseicaly when such sad story."
5,This ACTUAL Diary makes you feel like you are Alice!,I originally thought that this book was going to be boring.. i had to read it for my summer reading for school. After a few pages.. i was hooked. I could not believe that this was a real diary of a real girl. This book is very descriptive and I personally think that every teenager should read it. This book shows what a life hooked on drugs is really like and how horrible it is. I also think that this is a good book for adults to read so they can understand what it is like for many teenagers today!
5,...,"Excellent book, It's dark, touching... you read this book in one day it's so good because you want to know what happens....i wish there would be more books like this (well there's another one but not as touching it's jay's journal or something like that..) READ It , it's aperfect teens book"
5,wow...,"I loved the book. I got it out of the school library the about 20 minutes before the end of the day and was finished by 7pm that night...I couldn't put it down...I asked several friends (both male and female) to read it, and every one of them loved it as well. I recomend it to anyone and everyone."
1,Drug War Hype,"This is an entertaining bit of fluff designed to frighten teens. Anybody who believes that this is really a diary written by a drug addict would have to be incredibly naive. It is clearly scripted, with limited credibility, and leads young readers into false assumptions about drugs. The book is potentially damaging because as soon as adolescents uncover one of its lies, they begin to doubt everything it contains. Yes, drug addiction is nasty and harsh, but this is not how it happens. Check out 'Permanent Midnight' or 'Junky' instead."
1,Storytime!,"This book is definitely entertaining, but is a work of fiction. And, while I thought this was a very good story, I was curious about a couple of things. Part of the ""diary"" was said to be written on scraps of paper, paper bags, etc. How interesting that a drug-addicted runaway managed to keep track of all those bits and pieces! In addition, how many young teenagers would use the word ""echelon""? So I award this work one star due to deception, and very bold deception at that."
4,Every Teen Should Read This Book,"I read Go Ask Alice in high school and found it to be a shocking depiction of a side of our world that was unspoken, at least back then. Whether its the true story of one girl or a fiction made up from multiple real accounts, it is a necessary read for any and all teenagers and parents."
3,im confused,ok so i just learned she wasn't real and i can see that now that i think about it. but a lot of kids do drugs and a lot of kids die from drugs and life around it. i don't see how propoganda works anyway. it just makes me want to do more drugs and be smart with them. she obviously wasnt that smart. but i read it knowing nothing about it and thought it was more along the lines of Electric koolaid.. but i guess i was wrong
1,Awful,"I honestly cannot understand why this book is heralded as some amazing, wonderful piece of art (and a true story, nonetheless!). I was expecting something so much better based on the reviews I had heard about it throughout the years. It is not well-written in the slightest, and also completely fictitious, by the way. I found it extremely tedious, uninteresting, and wildly unrealistic. In fact, I actually had to skim the last 50 or so pages just to be done with this ridiculous book. Besides the fact that it claims to be something it's not (a real diary of some teen drug addict), it's just not even a good book on its own merit. Please, please don't waste your time. Read something better."
5,"Loved it 20 years ago, loved it again","Whether this memoir is real or faked, it's a compelling look at a teenager's descent into drugs. This is a book that stayed with me from childhood and didn't disappoint the second time around."
5,this book touched me in such a way that i cannot discribe.,im 14 female and i read thia book in school i finished it before my class did. this book was so incredible i couldnt put it down and its so hard to believe that it was a true story.i would really like to buy this book and show my friends maybe it will help them out a bit.
5,This book was very informative on drugs and the affects.,"This book was a very inspirational one. It shows the problems and struggles that teens were and are faced with in life. The girl who wrote this story seemed to be very smart. If she a little bit more will power, she probably could have made it and lived a very succesful life as a counselor. Maybe if she kept writing in a diary, she may have been alright."
4,Depressing,"This is a very depresssing book about a girl who gets hooked onto drugs,runsaway,and makes decision with her life that affects everyone who knew her. But read this book and see where the life on drugs can take you."
5,A Classic,"...Whether ""anonymous"" is real or not, she/he gives a real insight on the soul of a confused teen. This is a must read for any pre-teen to teenager. The story is too real to dismiss. Though the usage of some words or phrases are outdated, the true meaning is still there."
3,Ask and You Shall Receive,"Go Ask Alice is an awesome book. The characters in the book are very easy to believe and are easy to relate to, such as when she runs away the second time, she's home for two weeks and her grandfather dies.You never find out ""her"" real name but you can imagine and see everything she saw based on the geat descripton. The book deals with drug addiction, sex, violence, drug busts, and run aways. You follow ""her"" to San Fransico, Berkley, Denver, an insane asylum, court, funerals and the hospital. ""She"" hurts her self and her family, when she comes back the first time she says that her parents are look so much older emotionally and physically. You find out how she feels about that and how it effects her family, and her self emotionally. A great book to read. Highly recommended. This book has very strong content, and may not be suitable for everyone to read. Happy reading.- LM"
5,Amazingly true,"I have read books before on drugs and how you feel and how it affects your life but they didn't stop me from trying drugs however, Alice's naked truth book made me realize what could happen and I will never try drugs again it made me cry and I think this should be a book that they make Mandatory for those who want to graduate High School I know it will help many as it has helped me. Read it."
1,Don't Go Ask Alice,"Please do not read this book, or even recommend it, if you believe it to be a ""realistic"" account of drug abuse. I cannot even fathom why so many people would give this book a 5-star review unless they were completely uneducated about drugs and alcohol. I checked out this book from my school's library for my book report on whether or not said book of my choosing is considered seriously literature. Spoiler alert: It's not. At all. I don't understand why this novel is on the banned books list; or rather it's there because it's just that terrible of a novel? I may come off as harsh, but I have never read a book this bad since Twilight. And that, my friends, is saying something.People, if you're checking out whether or not to read this book, click on the 1-star reviews and read those first. It seems those people are the only ones that realise what a sham this book is. Sad."
4,Great Life Lesson,this book is very emotional and sad.. It can teach one a lot though. I shows the downward life of taking drugs. and it shows it in a real way..The only thing that I wasn't pleased about with this book was the ending. It just sort of ends..with no real ending..but i (strongly) recommend it. I also recommend reading It Happened To Nancy. It is a very moving story.
3,Go Ask Alice,"This book provides an incredibly raw and real look at teen drug usage and the in your face effects of peer pressure. I would definatly not reccomend this book for young children or anyone who would be easily frightened by this books intensity. This book made me a little weary with its continuous description of the effects of drugs and their effects, I had a headache after reading this strangley- compelling novel."
1,how can you give it anymore stars than that?,"Ok no offense to anyone who liked this book, but if your considering reading this think carefully. Yes it's realistic for that time period, but not for now. This book is about a girl who is so stupid she barely realizes what she is doing. She does drugs, has sex when she's ""trippin"" ... She is completely uneducated about drugs, and for me her stupidity was annoying. I would rather read information about kids on drugs in our world today, because it would seem more realistic. I love to read, and I have to say this is one of the few books I had some real difficulty getting through because of how idiotic Alice was. Overall, I just want to say that if you read often and are used to main characters whith intelligance who live in a time period closer to ours then don't read this book. However is you like sad stories and stupidity doesn't annoy you, this book is one I think you would find enjoyable."
2,hoax-but entertaining read,"This book is a hoax and is very heavey handed when discouraging drug use. Alice is relatable with the whole teenage angst thing going on but she never evolves as if the author used the character as a guingea pig to show all the examples of drug abuse. If you don't mind the bad writing, the hoax and other short comings then it is a good mindless read."
3,Alright!,"Overall, it was an alright book. It was easy to read and really sad, it makes you think.The book really just wasn't for me, I thought it was very pretentious. That's just my opinion, it didn't take long to read, so I don't regret reading it by any means."
1,Fake!,"I read this book a few years ago and loved it. As someone who had some very troubled childhood years, I identified with the character. Now I have learned that this book is not an anonymous diary of a teenage girl. Instead, it is the work of Beatrice Sparks, an author who has written many other fake diaries. It's just propaghanda and I think it's disgusting to make such a claim in order to sell a book. Reminds me of another recent book... what was the name?... oh yeah, A Million Little Pieces."
3,dima,There is no way Alice could have tried ecstasy because it did not become available on the street until late 1970's.
3,Go Ask Alice,"I liked the book, Go Ask Alice, but sometimes it was shocking to the mind. I recommend this book to anyone who is feeling lost or thinks that drugs may be the answer. It is a gripping novel that will reach out to your heart. Go Ask Alice is a real look into the life of a drug user. The surprise ending will scare anyone out of ever doing drugs. Your emotions will go up and down. Read it, and you will never be the same."
4,Go Ask Alice,"As a choice given to read by my teacher, I was not exactly thrilled to be reading this book. I didn't think I could relate to the story, mostly because of the fact that I am not a drug user. But when I started reading it, I started to enjoy it. It is the story of a girl's problems with drugs. Alice's emotions are like a roller coster ride, going up and down all the time. Every teenager can relate to the story of Alice. The book is intensly realistic and is very powerful. Alice is every teenager you meet. She is a crazy, confused girl who just wants to be accepted. The story shows how easy it is to fall into drugs and alcohol. Alice goes through a lot in the story. As I read the book, I could understand what drug users go through in life and why they do things for drugs. Overall, I recommend this book with great enthusiasm. It is a great story and can really impact a persons life."
4,A heartbreaker,"First off, no one can really write a review on someone's diary but all well. I have to admit that the first half of this book sucked. I think it's just because of the time difference. Since this book was written in the early '70's, life and people were different then they are now. The subject of the book seemed so uneducated and she wrote in simple sentences. But...it got better. It's very enojoying to go through her life with her. The reader has so much hope for her which makes the ending not only angering but heartbreaking. It was a good read."
1,THIS BOOK IS A FRAUD!,When I first read this book I didn't like it at all. But then when I heard that it wasn't written by an actual teenage girl but written by Beatrice Sparks I was extremely mad about how a grown man could write a fake book just to make money. This man is making teenagers look bad. Just because parents divorce doesn't mean they do drugs its a false stereotype. If I could I would rate this book a -99999999 out of 99999999!
1,!!! URGHHH !!!,"""Go Ask Alice"" is a book about a girl who does drugs and pays for her actions in the end. I suppose that this COULD be an alright cautionary tale to those who do drugs or those who are being pressured to do drugs, but I mean, C'MON, PEOPLE!!! It doesn't take a genius to figure out that this was a load of bull by a shrink who was probably crazy herself. Dr. S. often controdicts herself from page to page. 'Alice' will be all like, ""I hate drugs"" and then she'll be smoking who-knows-what out back within the hour. I suppose we should cut the author a bit of slack, but geez, how much worse could this mess of words honestly get???"
1,This wasn't written by a teenager at all,It's an open secret that this book wasn't written by a teenage girl at all -- it's thinly-veiled propaganda that purports to be a picture of the adolescent experience. Double-ick.
1,Let's consider a more realistic approach to this...,"Go Ask Alice is nothing more than a clever work of anti-drug propaganda. If you search far and long enough, you will find many of these ""real-life dramas"" written by ""anonymous"" victims. There is one story in particular that deals with satanic worship and follows the ""Go Ask Alice"" formula exactly. They are practically the same book, just replace every drug reference in Alice with ""Satan"", ""Dark Lord"", or ""His Hoofed Highness"", and you have another inspiring tale of a teen engaged in a life or death battle to overcome that which is immoral (I think this ""victim"" goes by the name of Stan).The more I think about it, the more convinced I am that the ""Anonymous"" author of Go Ask Alice is indeed a 70-year-old man with no writing skills whatsoever, living in Texas on a government pension, and with a history of drug-use that is limited to his twice-daily dose of Lipitor."
1,Propaganda!,This book was obviously written to scare kids away from drugs. No one as messed up as Alice would have been capable of keeping a detailed journal.
2,This is what I think....,"Well this book was ok. It kept me reading it which is usually a challenge. I however did not enjoy it. Reading about a girl who gets hooked on drugs and is dumb about it all is not interesting to me. I did cry though once while reading it. I also wonder what she thinks about people reading her diary. I know i would never want people to read my diary after i die even if it is to inform the public about how things really are. Overall i didnt like the book and i wouldnt recommend it to anyone unless they like to read a drug addicts diary when you can sum it up by saying she does drugs, has sex, tries to clean her life up but fails every time and ends up overdosing and dieing."
2,Go ask alice is two thumbs down the drain and into the sewer,"Go ask alice is an ok book, i think this is a two star book it has good information about what doing drugs could lead upto.i still think this book has alot of fiction instead of facts just to keep the reader interested.some points of the story are major turnoffs for male reader's because it's really hard to relate to certain problems of the opposite sex.The author of the diary uses all these big words and seems articulate but then again time after time makes alot of dumb decisions.Everyone makes bad decisions, but anyone with enough sense would try to get help or change their lifestlye, also the author cleary isnt an fifteen year old girl."
2,"Why ""Go Ask Alice?""","Go Ask Alice is supposed to be the diary of a teenage girl. Anyone can read this book, but it is more directed towards the teenage youth especially teenage girls. There are definitely some interesting parts in this book, but more then anything is it confusing. As a guy I didn't really like this book because it's not something I relate to. Some things I did understand and then there are just things in this book that you think the writer might not understand. If you proceed to read this book your feelings toward the book will change as you move along through it. I recommend this book to teenage girls because they can understand the author of the diary more then a guy would, however this book might scare all teenage kids about drugs. After reading this book I feel that the ending was a total let down and that is probably the biggest thing I would change about this story or diary."
1,AWESOME,"this book is great. if you read it you can begin to understand that there are actually hundreds of people out there just like you. fighting with addiction, family, and relationships. i read this book all the time because it relates so well with what me and my friends deal with all the time. this book is almost as addicting as marijuana! if you pick it up theres no putting it down! read it!"
1,Go ask someone other than Alice,"I thought Go Ask Alice was a terrible book. The entire book was about a girl who is hooked on drugs and has a hard time getting off them. Go Ask Alice is written in diary format and is confusing to follow. On top of that, The subject of the book is already disappointing enough without the inappropriate language of the book. If I had to make a change I would change the all the parts where she complains about how her life is so tough. Alice thinks her life is always tough all the time and she should just commit suicide, she should talk to starving kids from Africa or people without homes. She creates her own problems. If anyone were to read Go Ask Alice, which they shouldn't, I would suggest that it be a mature person over the age of 16 because it has explicit detail of sexual activities and drug content."
5,angela kern bak middle school of the arts,"Go ask Alice is an enlightening story of a teenager and her trials and tribulation with drug abuse and her social life. I really liked this book because it was so real to me I know a few people a lot like ""Alice"". Her struggles with fitting in and making good friends are so true to this day and age. The end of the book really touched me how she was saying that she didn't think she needed a dairy anymore and that her life was better now. I really got into this book, like when she started to get ""straight friends"" as she called them she was so worried that they wouldn't like her because for her past, I was worried right along with her. Another thing that was real to me was how she was having dreams of marrying Joel and how he one of the only people that seemed to understand her. I would recommend this book to anyone who is bored with reading the same old thing I really liked and maybe you will too."
4,Go Ask Alice book review,"This book was addicting. Once I picked it up I couldn't set it down. This girl's life was amazing and throughout the book I kept routing for her to get off the drugs and turn her life around because I know that she really wanted to. All through the book she kept saying how she wanted to do good and didn't need the drugs, but every time she would get off them she would get right back on. I know that when I am fifteen I will never be able to do the things that she did. She ran away for months at a time to completely different states. She was so independent and able to make her own decisions with out the help of others. She was really impressive. Although I really enjoyed the entire book I was disappointed in the ending. The girl stopped writing in her diary and the story just sort of ended."
5,Horrifyingly . . . wonderful,"Go Ask Alice was most definitely one of the best books I have ever read. One thing that made it so great was that it was *real*. It actually happened. I could actually relate to what ""Alice"" was going through in some parts of the book. The book takes you through highs, drags you low, builds up to several climaxes, then BAM, the epilogue (which made me cringe) slams you in the face. Go read, you won't regret."
5,every teenager should read this,"I first read this when I was 12, I am now in my 40s. I can't count how many times I've read it in all those years. It truly is a wonderful eye opening experience into the life of what drugs can do."
5,"Fiction or not, it is fascinating to read","Ok, so I'm honest enough to admit that I always thought ""Go Ask Alice"" was indeed a teen's diary about her decent into drug use and prostitution written anonymously to protect her identity. Now I find out that perhaps that isn't so, that it may be fiction.That aside, the book is fascinating to read. I don't care if it is fictional or partially fictional, it is hard to put the book down.Simply put, it's frightening even if some of it doesn't seem plausible.We all read to be entertained or to learn something new and this is entertaining. So why is everyone upset that it may be fictional or partially fictional? Who cares?Just read it and enjoy it for what it is. A frightening book about a young girl's battle with drugs."
3,Okay for some,"When I was a teenager, I read this book (along with some of the others that were written by Beatrice Sparks). I thought, at the time, that it was a pretty good book. I've since come to realize how absolutely ridiculous it is. The book is pretty much solely focused on the narrator's drug use, which is pretty unbelievable given the age that the narrator is supposed to be. It is almost like the tales of monsters that were meant to scare kids into acting properly hundreds of years ago, except that it's a more contemporary version--the monsters are turned into addiction, drugs, and drug users.I think the book *might* be okay if you go into it knowing that it isn't real, and that it's basically a very long anti-drug pamphlet."
2,"Corny, Dated, Propaganda","I think the title of my review says it all. This book has an agenda, and is from a time when drug use was more culturally prominent. I thought it was interesting enough as a child, but looking back I realize what it is. A modern fairy tale making a corny, unrealistic attempt to keep kids from trying drugs."
3,not sure if this is fiction,when i first read this book i was shocked and uncomfortable about the way how the author described alice's feelings or how seriously she used drugs. this book made m realize that oe wa or th other drugs can make you cause suicide
1,ATTENTION!!!!!,"Go Ask Alice, a book about a teenage girl who falls victim to a life of drugs (amoung other things), is not a book for those not strong stomached. I did not enjoy the book for two reasons:1- Too depressing2- Too annoyingExplination- Go Ask Alice was depressing because of the many rollercoaster rides she takes you through. The book was annoying because Alice plays a helpless girl that lets the world stomp on her and than expect the world to know what she's thinking.Bottom Line- Go Ask Alice gets 1 star from me mainly because the predictability of it- every time you turn the page- more complaining. I understand that the book is based on a real girls troubles and her real diary- however, the reading process is one that should be joyful, suspenseful, and wonderful- not depressing."
1,"Folks, don't be fooled. It's fiction.","While GAA has some intrinsic interest as a document of its times, it is fundamentally dishonest to present it as a true story. It would work for me as a novel, but a true story it is not. It has already been exposed as a work of fiction. I rated it with only 1 star because of the fraud on the reading public. If it had been honestly presented as a novel, it would have rated 3 stars. According to the New York Times Book Review, the real authors are Linda Glovach and Beatrice Sparks, who went on to write other such teen novels."
2,none,"It's interesting and kept me turning the pages, but it dosn't really sound like a real diary even though I hadn't lived back in that time. The subject has so many personalitlies throughout this book and dose things that she would never do at the beginning or throughout, drugs or no drugs. It sounds like someones trying to stamp into your head that drugs can ruin your life, and this is what they do. Sometimes there is no real reason for the main charecter to be doing whatever. An interesting read, but not to factual. There are better books."
1,a fictional story full of misinformation and lies,"first off, this book is not the diary of a teenage drug addict. it was written by beatrice sparks, author of many similar scare stories designed to discourage teens from drugs, premarital sex and satan worshiping. and, as anyone who has ever been a teenage drug addict, or even a casual experimenter will tell you, this book is a completely inaccurate representation of drug culture. i was forced to read this book when i was in high school, and re-reading it now i find it just as laughable and factually faulty. while i do not in any way condone drug use, i am firmly opposed the use of LIES and PROPAGANDA to teach our children not to use drugs. the dangers of drug abuse should not be taught by the use of fear. real information about drug abuse is available, with REAL stories about REAL people. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK."
1,sixties propaganda,"the writing in this book is good, and it's sad that ""Go Ask Alice""'s author is supressed to this day from claiming his work. it is a depiction of a teen gone down the wrong path on drugs. she's lonely, pressured, and unhappy, and then she's introduced to that evil LSD, and sucked down a vacuum into the drugs, which beat up and eventually killed her. but does this really read like a girl's diary? especially a girl who's in the throes of a drug addiction, and apparently still thinks it's a priority to keep a diary? and why is she still anonymous? there is no alice, this is not a diary, this is just old 70's anti-drug propaganda. (the title is a reference to a jefferson airplane song, for you pre-teen girls reading today. it's called ""white rabbit"")"
5,Very exciting,"I think that you should read this book because it is very interesting and once you start reading it you can't put it down. The reason I enjoyed it the most was because I liked the topic it was based on; it just reminded me of things that go on in this world still today. I think this book was a non-fiction book because it was this girl's own personal diary. It was all in her own words and all of it was how she felt about drugs, people, and life. In this book you also never find out the girl's name. But she was smart when she was in school; she had friends on and off, and I think she was only using drugs to fit in with her friends. The worst parts in the book, besides what happens at the end, is when she is in a asylum. While she was there she was really freaking out; she was seeing bugs that were eating at her body. They ate out all the skin on her hands (so she says)."
5,You Should Read Go Ask Alice,'Go Ask Alice' is a very good book i loved it.It was the best book i have ever read.Most books i have read i would not finish or i would not read it but this book i could not stop reading i thought it seemed so real .And also i loved how the book said so many details about here trips and her life and kids she hung out with. My favorite part was when she was babysitting but then on tne next page she woke up in a mental hospital and she did not know how she got there man at that part i just could not wait to read the next couple of pages. I really wish she would of kept writing in her diary cause i really want to know if she stayed off durgs and how she died. Thats the only part that i did not like cause it did not tell you how she died i would really like to know if she died from drugs. I wish i can find another book like Go Ask Alice cause i would really like to read a book like that again.
2,i didnt like it,Me personaly I didnt like it. I hated the way it ended. And then the book had action and then it didnt. I would not recommend reading this book to any body that likes action in a story. This book is for a person that likes
5,Go Ask Alice,"The book Go Ask Alice as a diary about Alice's life. Even though this book is about a girl taking drugs, this book still influenced me because it made me realize how bad drugs can be. Before I read the book, I thought this book was just going to be about a girl who is really nice, but it turned out she was on drugs. After I read the book, It made me realize what drugs can do to your life. This book mad me think about all the people in this world that use drugs. Teens that are using drugs think that there isn't and serious effects to using drugs, but really they are pretty serious. Teens that start drugs think that they are just going to try it and never do it again, but really they will end up doing it many more times. Drugs are very addicting so don't even try them!LIlly Goldberge"
5,go ask alice,"about 3 years ago on my birthday as a ""present"" my cousins droped 3 hits of extacy in my drink. it was the begining of the end of my life! for 2 1/2 years i struggled threw my speed, and acid addictions. i got beten up, thretend, and at points i was almost dead. i was failling my classes at school, loosing my familys love, waking up in weird places like at people who i had never met in my lifes houses. my freind, who had just recoverd from ""mental issues"" gave me go ask alice as a present for my birthday 2 years later. it sat there on my stand for at least 3 months. Sadly my freind took his own life after he was realeased from padre institution. then i started reading it. i suddenly became wrapped up in this book it helped me so much and it was also so sad. without this book quiting drugs wouldnt have been so easy. and the worst part about the hole thing is..........im only 14 years old."
4,What a trip,"This book provides a harrowing account of profound teenage despair. Although this girl's life is more extreme than most, I think her story is an indictment of American society. With coldness surrounding her, this girl has nowhere to turn. ""Go Ask Alice"" is a well-written, painful account of the depths to which a teenager can sink under the wrong circumstances. Avery Z. Conner, author of ""Fevers of the Mind""."
3,Yep,So this diary wasn't all that exciting to me really. All in all I was very unimpressed. The anonymous writer just depicts life and how her highs were. She just described what millions of people already know about drugs. Very unfullfilling.
5,"Opened my eyes wide, this is a book I'll never forget!","I thought this book was an outstanding book. It's not written by some brilliant writer but merely a 15 y/o girl writing her most personal and intimate thoughts in her diary. It goes through her most terribly painful and wonderfully joyful experiences as a teenager. This girl goes through some of the worst things imaginable that I wouldn't wish upon anyone. I definately think that parents of adolescents should read this book and if they think thier children are mature enough to handle it, encourage their children to read it too. This book opened to my eyes, not only to the world of teenage drug use but to the teenagers thoughts, and to the addiction. I will never forget this book as long as I live and I definately reccomend it to anyone with an open mind looking to be truely touched."
4,Powerful,"This is a disturbing and misleading book as it takes you through ""Alice's"" enconter with drugs and how she just cannot live without them.""Once you've had them, there isn't even life without drugs...""-Go Ask Alice"
3,It is definately a wake up to reality!,"I recently read the book Go Ask Alice. I really enjoyed it a lot. I think that it would definately make some kids wake up to reality. It is definately a down-to-earth book. However, I found that some parts of it were unrealistic. I mean I know that we only see Alice's point of view but where were her parents throughout the whole book. I don't understand how her parents could just keep taking her back in after she would just leave. This seems so real though because kids that do have whatever they want or people who really care for them, like Alice's parents, you wouldn't expect something like this to happen but in the end these are the kids that it really does to. I think all teen agers should read it."
5,!* Realization of Drugs *!,"I was assigned to read this book for school and i had heard about it before; It was a true story about a girl who gets into drugs and her spiral path to hell and back. I read the book in 1 day; my mom kept saying ""Go out and do something"" but i locked my door and read, wept and realized what so many teens were getting them selves into these days. Although it was written 25 years ago it could pass as a contemporary piece. i have never been much of a reader and definitely never finished a book in 1 day so this novel inspired me that reading can make you feel the characters true pain; i recommend this book to anyone who wants to hear a true story of pain, agony and pure sorrow!"
4,"A REAL diary???No one will ever know, but still a MUST read!","The first time I read Go Ask Alice I was 15 years old. I am 25 now and have just finished reading it again, making it the 4th read. There is alot of controversy over whether or not the book is a real life diary. I wouldn't have questioned it when I was younger, but as an older ""wiser"", more experienced person...I do have my doubts. The argument that the book is fictional is that it brings out just about every drug stereotype we've all heard before, the sexual abuse and promiscuity, the evil-druggie friends that torment her when she's off drugs, the gateway she follows into other drugs, etc... However, we could also argue that these stereotypes weren't just pulled out of thin air, they really do happen. It is quite possible that ""Alice"" did exist and did write this beautiful yet tragic and heart-wrenching journal of her young life. Does it really matter? Not to me. It's a TRUE TO LIFE tale, and that's all that really needs to be known."
5,mind blowing,go ask alice is a mind blowing book I dont know what I would do if that was my daughter!
5,Thanks Mom,"My mother bought me this book to read when I was 13. The realistic descriptions of what Alice went through made it so I was not courious to know how drugs would make you feel, I felt I already knew. I thank my mom for this experience because I fell it saved me from one."
3,ALICE STILL HOLDS TODAY'S TEENS' ANSWERS,"This is a riveting story, told in diary format, of a teen who accidentally at first finds herself seduced by the world of alcohol, sex, drugs, and crime. The character referred to as ""Alice"" writes so honestly in her diary of all her thoughts, hopes, happiness, dreams, fears, guilt, and pain. Because of this, the diary from a previous generation lives on. The content is severly adult, yet teens who will read this book will not find that shocking. Hopefully, what they will find shocking are the results of Alice's chosen life. The reader sees Alice wanting to do the right thing, loving her family, and desiring to be done with her deadly habits. Alice holds nothing back in her writing, and her life that could have been lives on in those who read her. Most likely it will not become part of many schools' curriculum; this book should not be read without discussions following."
5,"After you've had it, there isn't even a life without drugs","This is an amazing book about the truth on drugs. The diariest's coke is spiked with LSD at a party, this paves her way to a life of drugs. After this she tries everthing, acid, torpedos, speed, pot, whatever she can get. Once she tries to stop her old dope friends hassling her about being ""square"". The rest is a heart touching, sad novel, well the whole thing is sad and so realstic that you'll think your the writer of this book or you know her. It is a GREAT book. I got it on the 25th and it's the 29th and I am finished. Read It."
1,bad teenager choice,I purchased this for my 14 yo daughter without breifing it first. This is not something a young teenager should read!
3,Okay,"A pretty good book, but not as good as it could be. Read it if you want. Everything that can go wrong goes wrong. Too bad."
5,an example for every teenager,"i thought that this book was a masterpiece. i am happy that it was published and i was glad to have read it. i have tried to commit suicide by overdosing on tylenol, but after reading this book i realized how lucky i was not to have given into drinking and drugs. she showed me what it is like to have been a teenager who moved around quite a bit. i left everything i had known in california to move to oregon with my family. i too had desperate times fitting in but i never went to those drastic states. i too have seen the upclose effects of drugs and alcohol and to me it's not worth it to torture your family and friends with worrying. i believe that everyone needs love and compassion and i am here to help. this book opened my mind to a lot of bad things, and showed me the good in people and how to change this world. i loved this book and recommend it be required literature in classrooms."
3,Still rings true.,"I read this book as an adolescent, and again as an adult. ""Go Ask Alice"" rings truer today than it did 25 years ago. At 36, I can't even count the number of my friends and acquaintances whose lives were ruined by drugs. What a waste."
3,a reader,"I read this book as a teenager and was quite scared. But now looking at it again, I would gently suggest that it is made up. It is cleverly done, but there is just too much in there that probably would not happen, particularly the parts where she travels around but manages to keep writing entries, or the part where she goes to someone's house and just happens to be accidentally drugged. A very interesting book, but I would like to know who really wrote it."
3,Go ask Alice - VR,"This book was really interesting and sad. It also made me appreciate my life, and really made me want to prioritize it better. It was even more intesting and sad because the main character was not fictional."
4,perfect early teen reading-gets to the point,"Loved this book when I was 12 and highly recommend it to my middle school students now. ""Alice"" is easy to like and relate to. The times were different but the emotions are the same. Thought provoking, sad and necessary."
3,A Girl and Drugs,"Go ask Alice is a true story about a girl with some serious problems looking for a solution. While looking for the solution she runs into the world of drugs. At first it provides temporary relief from her stress, but it only puts her in a mush worse position that she started with. I thought Go ask Alice was an interesting book because it was true. Reading about the hardships and problems of others is not what I find amusing, but the fact that these kinds of things actually happen in the world and one single choice you make can affect the rest of your life. It helps me understand a parent's concern for their kids and the activities that they participate in. It was tragic the way the main character kept returning to the world of drugs after she swore to stay clean. It makes one realize how powerful and addiction can be."
3,After reading Go Ask Alice...,"The book Go Ask Alice is an actual diary of 15 year old girl. It shows us how easy it is to get involved with drugs. This book was really good to read, because you can really understand what's happening if you ever use drugs. Some people don't know the serious danger of drugs. But when you read this book you can actually learn about it. This knowledge of drugs can protect you from serious danger. I'm so glad that in my life I got to read this book, because now I have some ideas to protect myself from drugs. I really want to share this book with my best friend. I strongly recommend it."
3,what happen at the end,I don't understand this book to me it was a lot of confusion with her in her life. If you read this book make sure you pay close attention to the detail and every little part of the book to completely understand it. The book Go Ask Alice was an anonymous book so don't go hurting your self trying to find out who she is . I hope you have as good or better luck with understanding this book than I did.:)
4,Worth the read.,This book is a powerful read for teen-agers especially. The fact that it is a diary makes it seem like you get to know the young writer personally.
5,my review,Go Ask Alice is a phenominal diary. It is a true story and sad to say a lot of teenagers can relate to this book in so many ways. Most all teenagers feel like they have noone to turn to noone who cares and nothing matters anymore so they go down the wrong road. In this book alice tried drugs unwillingy; from there on it went down hill she started doing this she would never do selling drugs haveing sex for drugs running away from home. When things started to get better for her they actually just got worse so end the end she went crazy and I will let you read the book to fiqure it out. All in all it is a five star book for everyone to read.
4,Who is Alice?,This book is so incredible. Even though this is a short book it takes you awhile to take it all in. After I closed the book I sat there stunned holding back tears. Alice is just your average girl who stumbles into the world of drugs. I just wanted to jump into the book and help her but I couldn't. The part that touched me the deepest is that Alice was a real person and she was writing about her life. I would encourage all to read this. Due to it's intense nature it is a book for teens and adults.
3,"Good Book, But.....","I first read this book in high school and it has stayed with me ever since. I think that it's a great book for teenagers to read so that they can understand that a life filled with drugs leads nowhere. But it's not a real diary. It was written by Beatrice Sparks who has written other teenage ""diaries"" about drugs, AIDS, satan worship, etc. I was really upset when I found this out because it is portraid like a real diary and it did have a big effect on me. I guess I'm just trying to say that I like the book but don't read too much into it."
5,A real page turner,"A great read for those interested in learning how dabbling around in drugs can lead to destruction in life.That being said, this is a personal favorite which I have read multiple times."
3,I think she was murdered,"On reading this book a few years ago, it was my -- 'hit', hunch, or opinion -- that the protagonist did not die from an accidental overdose, as the editor implied, but was murdered for having informed upon several high school students who were selling drugs to other students, likely as 'foot_soldiers' in an organized crime ring. \"
4,go ask alice,"The harrowing true story of a teenager's decent into seductive world of drugs. The dairy so honest you mat think you know Alice -or someone like her. Read her dairy. Enter her world you'll never be able to forget AliceAlice is a 15-year-old girl, who is an alcoholic, drug addict, and a person with no will power. When she moves to a new house she meets a girl named Chris who is just like her except a little bit older. They become by selling drugs to the high school people. After a while she runs away from home to Berkley to make a boutique cause the kids there are so rich. When they came back home all the people get mad at her to get them deals for drugs and acid. They even started harassing her. She started drugs again and sometimes she got so crazy that she started to hurt herself until she started to bleed. If I say more I'll give away the whole so read it. If you like that teach you something or something that or something that is just plain weird read this book."
1,Don't waste your money,"Admittedly, I would not have read this book except it was one of our book club selections. Once I started the book, I would not have finished it except it was one of our book club selections. It is a painful read - not because of the supposed trials and tribulations of a troubled teenager, but because it is an obvious fraud. I knew every word I was reading was a lie. It is an absolute insult to think anyone could honestly believe this was written by a 15 year old. Maybe unknowing adults in the 1970's would have believed there was some authenticity to the chain of events, but I think most adults would have been able to recognize the writing style is not that of a 15 year old. The words used; the expressions used; none of it is from the perspective of a 15 year old. I would think, almost 40 years later, this book would be sold for what it really is - a lousy work of fiction."
3,three stars for the comedic value,"This book made me crack up repeatedly. It's utterly rediculous and obviously fake and is indeed the literary equivalent of reefer madness. I'd like to point out that the idea of dealing to elementary school kids is rediculous because just as William Burroughs said in Junky, they have no steady source of money so even if they did manage to get hooked, they'd just beg you for handouts rather than paying you for it."
1,nonsense,"It's a fitting testimony to this book that a previous reviewer stated they believe it to be a fiction masquerading as a confessional, but went on to praise it and give it four stars.This book is a product of ignorance and fear-mongering. It painted with a two-color palette and lacks balance, perspective, and truthful experience. Savvy teens will reject its complete lack of honesty and versimilitude. Do adults really think that teenagers are so naive, they can't discern propaganda from life? I mocked this book when I was 14 for its obvious fabrications.How will it impact kids' decisions to know that they are being fed untruths, 'for their own good'? It simply leaves them distrustful and without reliable information or guidance."
1,Terrible book,"This book should not be read a factual history of one teenager's personal experience with drugs and a runaway lifestyle, as it presented. It is a fictional account written by an adult who imagines what Alice's life must be like. Yes some parts may be believable, but most passages seem too shallow and stereotypical to be real. It is badly written and overly preachy. I was at many of the geographical locations mentioned by Alice during the time of her supposed travels. Most of the specific places she describes are fictional and never existed. If you want books with real teen experience go find the books of S. E. Hinton. I would not purchase this book for teens. To recommend this book would be a diservice to intelligent young adults."
5,Engaging and heart wrenching.,"This was hard to put down. Not the light and fluffy stuff I usually read, but it was recommended to me so I bought it. Completely engaging, thought-provoking, and heart wrenching."
3,Not Bad At All,"I read this book when I was a teenager- I am now 30 years old. When I was a teen, I read this book while being confronted with drugs and peer pressure. I found it very interesting, although not applicable to today's kids. Most kids do not start out with Acid, generally pills, pot, or drinking. I love the terms from that time period- dum dum, square, doper, etc. Whether this books is fictional or not does not change the fact that it is very interesting. Again, I found it more interesting as a teenager then an adult. I would encourage my own children to read this book when they are older. Just with any other books I read, I always take the information with a grain of salt. Who cares if this is written by a someone else and not a teen girl? It was still an interesting book worth reading!"
4,"Good book, but is it all completely true?","This book is a very inspirational, creative, and anti-drug story. It send us into the life of a young teenager's journey into the drug world, which is portrayed as being quit terrifying. The only thing is that it says that it is edited by Beatrice Sparks. Know, this obviously means copying Alice's journal into a book form, writing dates, and figuring out what fuzzy words are, but what else could it mean? Could it mean that she added in some extra-anti drug statements, just to justify her point of, ""Drugs are bad?"" This question remains unclear, but other than that it is still a fantastic book describing the horrors of a (fictional or non-fictional) young girl and her tragic life."
3,Good middle school read,"I first read this book when i was in middle school and after purchasing it and reading it many years later, I understand why it was so good.As an adult, I diddnt get as much pleasurd from reading it, its a good book for pre-teens though it introduces the euphoria drugs can offer. The best thing about that is the way it ends."
1,Listen here- I don't like this editor!,"I've read this story. Several times. And I take it as a good piece of fiction. Note the word fiction. I read another book, Jay's Journal, edited by the same person. I noticed repititions of lines and story patterns. I noticed the same basic message. This writing is manipulative. Perhaps these journals once existed. Perhaps not. But I believe that Sparks's editing was flawed. She used others' words to bring across her own point, and twisted them in the process."
1,Please! Don't waste time or money on this book...,"because it might have BEEN something special if read by an 11 year old, but anyone over that age or anyone who has had any experience with substances will find this book laughable.It's certainly not an accurate portrayal of LSD or Pot use... it's more like a desperate anti-drug commercial written by someone with little if any real-life experience with the drugs that are mentioned in the book.The author (certainly NOT Alice!) should have done some real-life research before making a fool of themselves."
1,"Lies, Lies, and Lies","I had to read this book for a project. It disgusted me. I was a bit leery about the book at first but after reading this line I knew it was fake ""Whoever says pot isnt addictive is a ---- idiot...""(I think thats the line) O.K. WEED IS NOT ADDICTIVE! I don't know squat about acid so I can't help you there. And one trip is not going to turn you into some hitch-hiknig prostitute who now apparently has to keep her diary on trash she finds on the freeway.Don't waste your money."
2,i'm being nostalgic and generous in my rating,"i have not reread this book since the age 10, at which time it impressed me as rather contrived since the newspapers weren't full of local teens dying from ""drugs"".In addition, i recall no mention of alcohol in its sorry pages, which seems rather suspicious.I remember vividly the runaway-and-use speed-and fit into groovy clothes chapter, which made me interested in amphetamines.From an adult perspective this segment as well as others seems, well, contrived or fake as many others have noted.Nevertheless, i enjoyed it as a kid and i never got ""messed up"" on drugs, but probably not due to this book's warning.I do remember other kids, even at that time(early 70's) saying the book was a fraud.Unfortunately, it has lost its entire power as a result."
2,Not the real diary of a teen.,"As yet another 40 yo who re-read this book, and found it was just not right, I went to visit Snopes and they have a whole page on it. Go read it for yourself and see. Sorry I'm not including the link- that's against the review guidelines. Anyway- Snopes is a great site for getting to the root of urban legends like this one. They have researched this book, and found that just as we all suspect (25-30 years later) that it is a bogus diary written by someone who wants to keep kids off drugs and is willing to lie to do so.As said earlier- their heart is probably in the right place, but this is not an accurate portrayal of drug use- either at the time it was written or now."
1,WAKE UP!! THIS IS A TOTAL FAKE! THERE WAS NO ALICE!!!!!,"I cannot get over all the kids out there who actually believe this garbage is TRUE! It's NOT! It was written by a middle aged woman named Dr. Beatrice Sparks.There was never any Alice, and these are the facts.Don't believe it?Go to the library, ask for the book, the librarian will take you straight to the FICTION section and get it.As a former librarian I can tell you that ALL librarians know the secret that IT IS NOT ANYONE'S DIARY!What it is, is a con job on the teenagers of the world and nothing else. DON'T BUY IT!"
5,"""Alice"" Touches Young Lives","I read this novel when I was a teenager and it deeply effected me. I had to read ""Alice"" in secret because of the deeply religious household I was raised in. I remember relating to ""Alice"", not because our behaviors were similiar, but because we were both just teenage girls, trying to find that thing we felt was missing.It is truly a shame that this novel is so often banned by schools. I feel that ""Alice's"" tale could impact many teenagers in a positive manner. I know it did for me."
5,This was an outstanding book,"This book was unbelivable. It is a wonderful book for readers of all ages. It really wakes you up to the fact of drug abuse with teenagers. I am 13 and this book made me realize the reality of using drugs. I feel that every teenager should read this book because it is an amazing book that will teach teenagers like myself about using drugs and how it can ruin you life. ""Alice"" was a young goody girl just like many of us think we are but she started to hang out with the wrong crowd and got into drugs. I've read this book so many times and it really helped me in making decisions about using drugs. Yeah, parent's tell thier children everyday that drugs are bad and that we shouldn't use them. I understood that drugs were bad but this book makes you realize that drugs will ruin your life forever and I recommend this book to people of all ages but especially teenagers."
5,still a must read,i read this book when i was 14 and that was some time ago. i can honestly say that it was one of the reasons that i never got into drugs. when my daughter is old enough i intend to give her my copy to read and i hope that it will help her to make the same decision that i did.
4,its really hard to beleive a girl could go through so much,"This book was really good. It was so real at times, but then there were parts where it made you wonder, how could so many horrible things happen to one person. It was almost like a story, one day she'd be happy the next, she was the lowest of lows. It was an amazing insite to the world of sex and drugs, and it makes you think twice. I didn't like it because it said a real diary, but it didn't seem real, it didn't seem like someone had actually been through this, but then you think how could someone who hasn't gone through it give such acurate descriptions??"
4,eye opening,"This book is a piece of reality. I know this girl is my age,yet she has been through more than I can conceive. I would recomend this to anyone who has ever considered useing drugs, this diary shows the consaquences of being careless. A definate personal library."
5,Great book you will have trouble putting it down.,"Go ask Alice is a great true life story. I loved it because it was written by a real person who experenced what happened to her. I wouldn't recomned this book to immature girls who don't like to her about drugs, sex, and guys. But it's a really good book any how."
3,Educators' Opinion,"As educators looking at this book as a potential instruction tool, Go Ask Alice does provide multiple avenues to discuss teen issues that are frequenlty too sensitive to address. While it may have been shocking at the time of its publication, this situation is more familiar to today's teens. While the publishers contend that this is a work nonfiction, we can't help but wonder how much editing altered the reality of this teenage girl. Too often, her voice is inconsitent. In one entry, she's very adolescent in her writing, in others she seems very educated and almost collegiate in her tone.Overall, however, if one were to teach this book, it might be a good idea to coordinate with the health instructor so that teens can get factual information about the effects of drugs and sex. Some historical context would also be helpful."
5,"""Go Ask Alice"" is a must read!!!","Reading ""Go Ask Alice"" has completely changed my life. I never knew what drugs could do to a person until I read this. This was one of the best books I've ever read in my entire life and I'm glad I did because now I understand the world of drugs and how scary it really is. To see what an innocent girl got wrapped up in is such a horrible thing. You get so involved with this book that you feel like you are a part of ""Alice"". I think this is the best way to experience drugs without actually doing them because you get in to ""Alice's"" life and you can relate to how she feels and the problems she is faced with. This book is so real and down to earth that it's a perfect book for any teenager to read! I recommend it to all teenagers and parents of teenagers."
5,A Wonderful Book!,"OMG! This was the first of the Annonymous books that I have read, and is probably the best! The book is so real, and so intense. You can't put it down! It shows how the life of a priviledged girl in the 60's with a drug-addiction really was. This is a wonderful book, and I recommend parents and their teens to read this together, it can really help them to understand eachother."
5,great,item arrived promptly. it's funny because they have a different size bookin the stores now but I am happy with what I received. Thanks
3,"Oh, Jeethuth Chrytht...","This book is so fake I find it funny. This is obviously not a real teen girl's diary, unless she's got a major in English at 15 - the writing does NOT resemble a teen girl's in any way, shape, or form. Other than that, I found it interesting... not great, not awful, either."
4,You Gotta Read This!,"Go Ask Alice is a book about a very confused girl that is not sure which way she wants her life to go. She keeps herself a journal of everything that she was thinking all of the time. I liked the book because it had a lot of detail of how she was feeling at every moment. Overall, this book is very good but I did not like how it was very repetitive at times. I suggest that this book should be for the age of twelve years old and up. There might be a lot of drugs in this book but I think that twelve would even be a decent age to show the kids that drugs are bad and can hurt your life dramatically. I think that I would make the characters in this book have more of a part other than the main character. I highly suggest this book and I hope that you think about it for it is worth reading."
4,Hey Alice ...,"Go Ask Alice is a diary entry of a teenage girl who was abusing drugs. Even though this book is about a girl taking drugs twenty-four-seven, this book was still influentional to me because it made me realize how bad drugs can be. Before I read the book, I expected it to be less serious than it was. After I read the book, I was really affected in a way where I was more aware whenever I came across someone that used drugs. This book made me concern about all the teenagers whose using speed, heroin, and all the other drugs out there. I've learned what goes on in a teenage brain that is being affected by drugs. They think that there isn't any serious affects to it and they can stop taking it anytime. Even if they say to themselves they'll stop tomorrow or maybe even tonight, they can't. I've learned that drugs are a bad habit, an addiction, that can't be cured by just running away from it."
1,i dont like this book,"In the book Go Ask Alice there were a lot of different things about the book that I liked and that I didn't like. For some reason or another I mostly disliked this book, it was a disgusting book from the very beginning. I truly felt that this was by far the worst book that I have ever read. It was to drawn out and didn't seem real. Also, throughout the book she kept trying to convince herself that she doesn't have a problem and that got annoying. I personally wouldn't recommend this book to anyone and think that this book shouldn't be read at school due to its horrible aspects. If I could change things about this book I would pretty much change the entire thing. The story just dragged on and the ending was a horrible idea. This book is more for females because they seem to enjoy this type more. They would most likely be around fifteen to seventeen years old. Over all this book stunk, I hope no other males in the world have to ever read this."
4,The Rollercoaster Ride of Drugs,"For mature readers only, this book is horrific at times, yet incredibly real and true. The reader rides the roller coaster of feelings that Alice does. The reader struggles to stay clean and fit in again. It is a wonderful portrayal of a user stuck in an unforgiving, at times hopeless world. This story takes place during the Vietnam War when hippies and drugs are permanent fixtures in America. Teacher discretion is highly suggested, yet today's world provides reason enough to use it in the classroom. Kids today are bombarded with positive ideas of drugs and are using them at a younger age than ever before. This issue needs to be discussed and possibly deterred by the obviously negative effects drugs had on Alice."
4,review,"Go Ask Alice is a first hand account of a teenage girl's struggle with drugs. She shares this true story through journal entries. The writer of this journal is a normal 15-year-old girl, until she goes to a party and is introduced to the world of drugs. Her life becomes full of twists and turns. Throughout her wild drug induced adventures she meets many different kinds of people, and many times attempts to become clean. ""January 24, after you've had it, there isn't even life without drugs."" Her struggle becomes worse when she is harassed and threatened by angry schoolmates. The harassment takes a drastic turn when she is tricked into taking drugs again. This book is a short and easy read full of shocking insight into what happens when a person gets involved with drugs."
4,A girl on the run.,"""~""Go Ask Alice"" is a diary that you sadly can't put down. A fifteen year old girl is on the run from an over whelming drug addiction. She can't say no and neither will her friends let her if she wants to be cool. Throughout the diary you can tell when her addiction gets worse as she can't remember dates, times, or names. Her morals take a complete a U turn when it comes to sex, drugs, and family life.""~ both grew up and went to college in small towns. Her dad is constantly working and has no time to notice his daughter's strange activities. Alice's mom is a constant nag on her fashion and attitude. When they found the diary, they published it under ""anonymous"" for the author. in first person so you, really get to kow the characters involved. It opens your eyes to a world that most people think they could never experience if they use drugs. Her first hit was off a dare. Her last was from a year of experience that was dark and scary."
1,go ask alice,do not read this book. it is propaganda and not the diary of any young girl named alice or anything else. the ending borders on pornography. who is this author who wants to demoralize kids who are struggling with addiction. the book could have been a great vehicle for hope. instead it sends the message that we will end up just like alice. this book is a slap in the face.
4,a must read for parents of teenages,This harrowing book tracks the down head struggle of drugs for a teenage girl. It's a real eye opener and one that should make parents of teenaged be more aware of their kids and the fragile mental state which is a teenager.
1,Hated this book,"This book was not my cup of tea, I had to read it for a book report and barely made it through! Alice is just the typical stupid teenager who gets caught in the drug world and cannot get herself out, simple as that, no depth to it at all!"
4,Go Ask Alice,It was a good story but a little outdated in some of the terminology. I remember reading this years ago and found it very interesting. I only re-read it because my 6th grader brought it home from the school library and was telling me about it and had some questions re: LSD etc. so I had to go over it with her. Its a sad commentary on the fact that no one noticed this girls problems with poor self esteem and mental health issues that lead to her destructive behaviors.
4,I Encourage Everyone To Read This Book,"""Go Ask Alice"" is a very good, easy read. This is the type of book I believe everyone should read so we can understand the effects drugs have on people. It helped me understand the hardships children and young adults go through and just how easy it is to fall into the drug world.Reading it has reminded me just how lucky I am and the importance of having a good, loving family.It's a great book and it makes me mad to know that it has been banned inside a lot of high schools; if these kids read anything, they should read books like this so they don't fall down the same road as the unnamed, main character.When reading this, keep in mind that it truly isn't written by an anonymously by a girl who went through the situation, it was written by Beatrice Sparks, a psychologist; it doesn't really change the affect the book has on its reader but I do feel that prospective readers deserve to know that the diary isn't a true diary from a troubled teenager."
2,Short,"I read this book a short time ago. To be honest, I wasn't impressed at all by it. The way the person spoke seemed to me as if she was perfectly ""there"" all the time and not under the influence of drugs. The descriptions of the feelings, I don't personally believe they achieve their truest form. I don't know but even being 14 when I read it, it didn't really impress at all."
1,truth is important; this book is a hoax,"This book is a hoax. I knew it even when I read it as a teen. Another reviewer had a good point, that it may have been based on a real diary but was extremely heavily re-written. especially all the anti-drug parts. Even as a teen, it seemed too cliched, predictable, far-fetched and preachy. too much of a neatly-crafted cautionary tale.Truth is important. Lying to people for any purpose is reprehensible, even with the best of intentions at heart."
5,SiNcE yOu aSkEd JeSsIcA....,"This book is a really good book to understand and learn the truth about teens and their drug addictions. The girl in the book is first turned on to drugs at a party playing ""Button Button Who's Got Button?"" in the ""game"" one of the girls friends laced 10 out of 14 cokes with LSD the girl described her expeirence as ""groovy"" and ""cool"". We live and learn about her addiction through her two diaries that she keeps. In the end you think that she turned her life around after getting out of the insane asylum, but shes got another thing coming. This book is really good I reccomend all young adults and adults to read it to find out what really goes on with teenagers."
1,Hard to believe,"Did the publisher pull this right out of a diary? I swear, the language and text are so dull, blunt, and repetative that it makes ""Alice's"" problems with drugs and social issues hard to relate to and understand. I became quite restless after the 3rd chapter or so, and just continued reading it so I could relate to and have a background on this so-called ""teenage classic"". If Everyman's Library ever put this book into their series, I swear, it's the end of great literature and influences.Personally, I enjoyed The Bell Jar much more. More intense, and a true novel of elegance and class."
3,review of go ask alice,I liked GO ASK ALICE because it was a book that i have never read before.I Just wanted to give u a review on how the book was. My review is Alice or should i say the anonymous girl was into alot of drugs but she wasnt always like that at the beging she seemed like a quiet little girl but after i started reding everything changed.My favorite part in the book was when she first gotten into drugs she didnt seem that afraid she didnt think much about the drugs she didnt feel she had a problem.I dont want to tell you to much but if you like books that you can relate to or you know someone who uses drugs then this is a book for you or you just like reading books that are interesting.I had to read this book for school but i found it to be a really good book i read alot of books.If you dont like reading u will like reading this.
5,A Real Diary of a Teen's Life,"Go Ask Alice is a true diary of Alice's life as a teenager. It's a diary written by Alice and she talks about how her life is around drugs, drinking, and guys. Her best friend is her diary, so she is always honest and is very true to the diary. You learn so much about how hard life can be for a young teenager and the solutions she figures out for her problems.I think that all teenagers and parents should read this story becuase you get a sense of what it's really like living the way Alice did. It's an amazing story that really inspires you to let others know how great it is and to tell them to read it. More than 4 million copies have been sold because it's just incredibal!"
3,alice - or the life of an addict,"i think if we talk about the subject of drugs we have to define some facts that must be mentioned: there are different types of books on the issue of drugs - if you like stories about the friendship of teenagers in the 60s, you may stick to ""that was then this is now"", but if you want to know how drugs can influence your brain, you could take ""go ask alice"" - the story of a 15-17 years old girl, leaving home when she starts taking drugs.to my mind it seems like a copy of the ""rocky horror picture show"" - but the book is after all quite shocking because the story seems to be realistic. So if you want to read a diary-show of the horrifying trips of alice with her inferiority complex - just go ahead and buy the book"
4,I think this book was the best of the best!,"This book is a book that applies to everyone..whether it be adults, teenagers, boys, girls, drug users, or nondrug users. The reality of the novel hit me as I read, and I was overwhelmed by the fact that this had actually happened, and is still happening. As a teenage, I loved how the author told her story ""straight up"", without trying to make a sordid story better or language cleaner. This is a book that everyone should have a chance to read."
4,Go ask Alice is a great book for teenagers.,"I am a student at Salmen High School in Louisiana ,and we had to read go ask Alice for english class. This was the first book I've really enjoyed that Ive had to read at school. The topic might seem to bad for high school, but it's really interesting and exciting to read. I'd recomend this book to other students because I enjoyed it so much."
4,This book is a good book that brings you back to reality.,Go Ask Alice is a sure way to get your attention. It brings reality to you. It makes you wonder about your own life and the situations that you will face.
2,"This book is ""OK"" and somewhat informational.","I think that the book ""Go Ask Alice"" is an informing book. It informs young people about the consequences of running away, doing drugs, and selling drugs. The book is an a diary format so the reader does not know every detail about the characters or all that goes on in her life. I think that any high school teenager should read this book especially if you're around drugs or are thinking about running away. Some things I do not like about the book are that the author is anonymous. I like to know the author's name and gender. The author never really tells the main character's name or what she looks like. It just makes you curious about exactly what is going on in the character's life."
5,Interesting...,"When i heard this book i picked it up because i thought it would give an un-opinionated look at drugs. Not for, Not against. And through alot of it there is actually a vibe of pro-drugs. Although the end gives and obviously anti-drug message. It really deserves a 4.5 but i gave it a 5 because it is very very good and exciting and most of it is not anti-drug. Drugs are commonly just discarded as evil. this book gives another look but not the best one. its good but there are better books out there that present a more realistic POV on drugs."
5,Awsome Book!,"This book Go Ask Alice was really great, I enjoyed it very much. At frist it seemed that Alice was afarid to do drugs but then she did drugs to try to fit iin. Alice was trying to make friends by doing drugs. It doesn't work that way, you don't have to do drugs to make friends. I suggest this book to everyone that likes to deal with people's problems."
5,this book tells you what drugs can do to you,this book really does tell you what can happen when you take drugs. It tells you how it messes up your whole life.
3,A Review About Alice!!,"THe first time before I had started to read this book, it looked very interesting. Then after a while i was really into it and I found that it was completely different than I had expected. The gilr in this story starts to use drugs for the first time becuase everyone else around her is doing drugs also. I think a lot of people can relate to this book and try to figure out a good way to overcome their drug use and sexuality.!!"
5,"Raw, Deep and real","I first read this book while traveling in Europe. Alice was a sweet, got all A's and B's, never break curfue kind of girl. Then, one night she went to this party and there was some sort of drug in the coke she drunk. Anyway, from then on she ""experimented"" with all sorts of dangourous drugs. She slowy starts depending on them to run her life. She runs away from home, but then returns after a while because she can't support herself. Her family takes her back in, but are so overprotective of her that she runs away again, and there is a lot after that so I won't spoil it for you."
5,One Word: Wow.,"I can't believe I just read such an amazing book. It's a book that all teenagers should read. I'm 16 and I'm not one to read a book for fun. I can't lie, this book was for school, but I read it in one day. And I never do that voluntarily. If you're looking for an interesting book to read, I highly recommend ""Go Ask Alice."""
4,Fixing what was broken,"This book was written by an Anonymous 15 year old girl. She was tricked into trying LSD at a party she attended. This opened the door for her wanting to try other drugs. Which in turn changes her life for good. She struggles through the year trying to fix what was broken,her life. I found thisto be extremely enlighting, it opened my to what really does go on in our society. I would recommend this book to anyone old enough to read (13 and up)."
5,A great book for all ages to read and learn from.,"I've just finished the book today. I could not put it down. I've read for five hours straight. Even though I'm only twelve I know what a good book is, and this is one of them. I've already read ""It Happened to Nancy."" Both of the books made a great impact on my life. Maybe one day I'll be in a situation like theirs and I'll think of them and make the right choice. I already have done ""It Happened to Nancy"" for a book report at school and everyone was shocked by what can happen to any one of us at any time. Rich or poor. Good or bad family. Twelve or Sixteen years of age.I hope to be reading many more best sellers of Beatrice Sparks, Ph.D. And I hope people will learn from these books and tell their children about Nancy and Alice and let them read the books like my mom did with me and I'm so glad she did."
5,"""Go Ask Alice.""","Go Ask Alice is the most informative book anyone can ever read about drugs and their consequences. It tells you exactly what it felt like to take them, what gets you hooked, how it tore one girl's life apart, and eventually killed her. It is the true story of her life, and what drugs did to her. It is the diary found after her death and in it she shares every experience she went through. From loosing her virginity to running away from home. This book has no lies. It will teach anyone how drugs will ruin your life."
5,"EXCELLENT, I read it over and over!","A very realistic and moving story. Even if you have never had a problem with drugs or family problems, you can relate to this book. I would deffinately recommend it to anyone. If you like it I also reccomend Crosses by Shelley Stoher"
1,don`t waste your time with this propaganda,"filled full of half truths and christian rhetoric, this worthless book reminded me of reefer madness. definetely ghost written by a religious group.targeted for young adults, this book should be ignored unless you desire a comic look at 60`s slang satire. even then not worth much."
4,Go Ask Alice,"Go Ask Alice is a true diary by an anonymous writer meant to show people how drugs will change your life forever. The book is about an average girl going though high school that accidentally gets drugs slipped into her drink at a party. She soon gets addicted to drugs and the book is all about her going though her life on drugs. For example, she ran away from her loving family to do drugs. Many things happen to her that change her life completely. After she got hooked in the drugs she knew her life would never be the same.I thought this book was very good. Go Ask Alice was a very informative book all about the world of drugs, and how it can change your life dramatically. This book can connect to another book, The Pearl, because moth main characters changed their life for the worse and both had a tragic ending. I wouldn't recommend this book to children because of the drugs, but I would recommend this book to anybody interested in the subject."
5,A normal girl who struggles to get her life back after drugs,THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST REAL BOOKS ON THE MARKET TODAY. I THINK THAT ANYONE WHO IS OR HAS THOUGHT ABOUT GOING INTO THE WORLD OF DRUGS SHOULD READ THIS BOOK. IT WILL INSTANTLY TELL YOU TO CHANGE YOUR LIFE FROM READING THE MISTAKES THAT THIS POOR GIRL HAD TO MAKE IN ORDER TO STOP. IF YOU HAVEN'T READ IT OR STOPPED BECAUSE IT SEEMED DULL.... PICK IT UP AND READ IT. AFTER READING THIS BOOK YOU WILL NEVER FORGET POOR ALICE.
4,"Easy reading, very interesting","This book was given to me as a school reading assignment, I think it's the first book that I've read through this year in school without my primary intention being just to finish it so I could get an A on the test. The book is actually the diary of a teenage girl. It is written in a way that makes it very easy reading, and interesting at the same time. Go Ask Alice is a day by day journal of a normal girl, who get's started on drugs with her ""new friends"". The message in the story is in one way another simple ""don't do drugs"" type of thing, but the approach is very unique, and causes the story to catch your attention. I read through this book saying to myself at the end of every day ""I wonder what happens tomorrow..."""
4,"Disturbing and Raw, Alice will haunt you","Go Ask Alice is perhaps one of the most disturbing, harrowing, shocking, and down right depressing books avaliable for young adults. It details one teen's spiral into the world of drugs, a world that eventually consumes her.I think that anyone curious about experimenting with mind altering substances should be strapped to a chair and forced to read this book. Alice is much more personal than all of the statistics we are constantly bombarded with about teen drug abuse. It gives teens a person, an image, that they can equate with the dangers of drug abuse, and that is more powerful than any facts that are presented to us by teachers and parents and television commercials. Alice speaks to all, and her message is clear.I would advise this to teens and parents alike, because not only is it amazing and raw, it is also true. Alice's story will change your life forever."
1,Is there a negative-5-star rating? No? Crap.,"Bullcrap on anybody who says this is powerful and moving. Some spoiled brat does a bunch of drugs, screws up her life, vows off drugs, then does more drugs and dies. What's that teaching me? Life is a stupid struggle I'm going to lose anyway? Screw that, I want my $6.50 and those four hours of my life back, please."
1,Blatant (...),"Whoa boy, did this book stink! Do not read this under any circumstance! It took only an evening to read and I want that evening of my life back. The blurb says this book is ""based"" on the diary of a 15-year-old girl, which is in my opinion an obvious gimmick and hoax. The whole ""harrowing progression into the mad world of addiction"" is a severe cliche. It follows the formula of a made-for-TV movie or an afterschool special. Don't get me wrong, there are some realistic touches, and in general it's a well-constructed piece of (...) It has the opposite intended effect--I think it's this kind of piece that turns kids ON to drugs...at least the ones intelligent enough not to be condescended to."
4,Depressing but real...,"It's a book that is hard to put down, yet at the same time, hard to read. There were a few times I wondered ig the story was only what was written in her journal or if things were aadded, or us it was her real journal at all. There isa no way to know for sure but it was so well written that can almost feel her pain and see into her mind. I was let down by the ending until I read the epilogue... her story made my heart hurt and wo how wonder how ame why some people, some people can be so cruel (not her,but her peers). Drugs can make a human do awful things. It is a sssssss story, but one that needed to be shared. I would recommend this book, especially to anyone who has lived a life with drugs, whether just a portion of their life or if it became their life; and also to those whom are thinkingor about experimenting with drugs...."
3,Definately for teen readers,"This is definately a teen read - cover to cover in one day. A little hard to follow in some places - continuity a bit vague - but overall a great read considering these are the diary entries of a drug addict. Opens your eyes to one girls struggles with drug addiction and isolation from the ""straight"" world. What these young girls will do for drugs is really frightening. Perhaps more parents should recommend something like this for teenagers who are teetering on the drug use age...."
4,Completely Blown Away!,"I JUST finished reading this book, it is very good, it is a good documentary to read if you like to read and like to know the cause and effects to drugs, and sex. The only thing that i did not like about this story was the ending, but i cant change that! i guess i just like happy endings! happy reading!"
4,Great!,"I chose to read this book and I'm realy glad I did. This book has every thing from depression to action and creativity. The book leaves out little detail, and you really get to know alice.If your intrested in books that have a little bit of every thing,this one has it all!"
5,Disturbed Souls Alive and High,"Go Ask Alice is a wonderfully disturbed diary of a female teenager and her descent into drugs. Written from a real girl's diary, it intoxicates the reader with unimaginable, but true, thoughts. She will take you through the city's dark streets and alleys and into the cells of her asylum. Eventually her destiny is revealed as you approach the end of her pages."
5,IT TELLS THE TRUTH!!,Hi everyone i am a 15 year old sutdent that uses drugs all the time and i read Go ask Alice and you know it tells the truth about drugs. it is what life with drugs is all about. She goes through stages and the stages are really wheat life is all about! i feel that the book is a very god book and tells the truth about drugs and teenages.I think that this boodk should be put in the school education so that the student's that use drugs should be awear of using drugs. Drugs play a big part in today streets and today's teenages life. We can't run from drugs they are everywhere and i think this book is a great way to show kids and teenagers that takin drugs can mess u and your falmiy and your life up and hurt the ppl around you. Drugs are serious and should be taken serious and i think this book explain's it the best and i also think that teen's should read this book if they're planning on usin drugs at any time!
1,Silly trash,"I read this book once as a teenager and once as an adult. Re-reading it confirmed my teenage assessment that it is laughable trash. It is not just factually innacurate, but steps well over the line into truly ridiculous, and blatantly obvious, propaganda.I did find a use for the book. I use it to teach my students to identify and dissect this type of material for what it is. Propaganda is often not obvious to young teenagers, but they need to learn to see it and not allow it to influence them."
4,70's Drug Addict Teen,"""Go ask Alice"" was a wonderful book about a young teenage girl that faces the effects of drugs in the 1970's. The name of the main character is unknown but is referred to as Alice. The main points of the book in my opinion were, how one crazy party with a lot of drugs can ruin your life and also that you family no matter what will be there for you. No matter how messed up ""Alice"" got her family still loved her and helped her out. The things I didn't like in the book were the sudden and odd ending. The ending gave me mixed feeling about the entire book because I was enjoying it so much and then it just abruptly came to a halt. I also didn't like how unrealistic it sounded even though it's a true story, no one really knows what is actually factual. Overall I still really enjoyed ""Go Ask Alice"" and would recomend it to people who enjoy real storys and are teen's or older."
5,Go Ask Alice,"This book really changed my outlook on drug users. I believe that because of reading this book, my life has changed dramatically. I truly enjoyed this book and was one of the best books I have ever read. I feel that she was trapped in her own life, like a prison and since she only wanted to make people happy because she wasn't happy with herself, she resorted to drug use. I find it ironic that the first and last times she used drugs was by accident. She had a very hard life and her so called friends didn't make it any better. I feel that if she would have never met some of the people in her life she definitely would have been better off. Lucky for her she had a very strong family bond and without her relationship with her parents and family she would have commited suicide.This book was one of the best books I have ever read and I highly recommend it to anybody."
2,"Yeah, right...","I don't believe a word of this book is true. It's like Jacqueline Sussann ghostwriting Judy Blume. As we follow the narrator's perilous slide into drugs, her recovery, her next perilous slide, her next recovery and so on, I'm left wondering how anyone can believe this ridiculous nonsense. As camp, it's kind of fun, but I'd have to be pretty deep into some wonky religion before I believed that any of these goings-on are even plausible."
4,I recommend this training kit,"After reading the book and doing all the exercises I feel that I really know Windows 2000 Server. I also used many practice exams before taking the real exam. I passed the exam but it was the combination of this training kit and 3rd party practice exams that got me through, I suspect this training kit alone would not have been enough to pass the exam. Although the content of this kit is excellent, I only gave 4 stars because there were several subjects in the exam that this kit did not prepare me for.From previous experience with other Microsoft exams, I recommend Microsoft's own books when studying for these exams. Microsoft Press material is the most accurate and up-to-date."
4,"Nice price, not a lot of gut though....","A few things surprised me when purchasing this book. 1. It's actually 2 books and several CD-Rom's. (70-215 Readiness Review book and Training Kit Book (943 pages) 2. In order to complete the excersies in the book, you must have 2 Windows 2000 Servers running. 1 you install using book disks the other installed unattended, then promote the #1 and so on.. later amounting to replicating both and setting up Dfs's, etc.. I only have 1 computer I could setup, so until I manage to get one, I'm screwed. BUT - for the price, it's a hella deal and excellent reference when reading braindumps."
4,Thank You Microsoft for a Good Book !,"This is a Wonderful Book by Microsoft, The Interactive Training CD is very Good in getting the material across. It made learning the Material a Snap. It covers the Exam Subjects very well and prepares you for the test. This is the third book in this series that I've used, and I love it. It's a Study guide for the Test, and a Reference for the Future when I need a Quick Refresher Course. It pays to supplement your study with another book or exam cram."
5,So glad these are available on DVD now,There's just no way to replace Mr. Rogers. My 2-year old is absolutely riveted by these shows. Hope they continue to release more.
4,Good 'ole Mr. Rogers,"My movies came in good time and in good shape. I would have liked for them to be a little cheaper, but overall, I'm happy with them."
4,Taking family dysfunction to a whole new level,"It's almost Shakespearean the way family drama and dysfunction escalates into violence, death and ruin in this film. The best thing about this film is, by far, the performances. Powerhouses like Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Albert Finney, and Marisa Tomei expertly portray their duplicitous, grasping, and broken characters, finding the humanity underneath their amoral behavior. The editing and time-shifting are occasionally clumsy, but the acting more than makes up for it."
5,A brilliant study of lives unravelling due to greed and desperation,You may have missed this unheralded gem - a gripping tale of lives unravelling due to greed and desperation. Brilliantly acted by a large cast - it doesn't strike one false note. Yes it's very dark but it doesn't wallow in the excessive violence of a Coen brothers' film. Catch this one.
5,Great Movie,"When I watched this movie, I had thought it was going to be cheesy. Because the way the film looked; and because, of the different type of film used. However, I was wrong. This film was great with a twist. You just have to watch it and see for yourself."
5,A SIMPLE PLAN...,"An entire family is annihilated after a desperate businessman named Andy (Philip Seymour Hoffman) convinces his weak-willed brother Hank (Ethan Hawke) to commit a robbery. Nothing goes according to plan, and everything that can go wrong, does. BEFORE THE DEVIL KNOWS YOU'RE DEAD is a story of total hopelessness. I kept wanting the situation to improve, knowing full well that things could / would only get worse. Marisa Tomei (Danika) plays Andy's frustrated, cheating wife. Albert Finney is Andy and Hank's tormented dad. BTDKYD has a delightfully bleak atmosphere throughout. I like the way it develops from a semi-humorous caper into an outrageous tragedy. Director, Sidney Lumet has certainly kept his sharp edge! Well worth owning..."
2,4 Star Story with 2 Star Acting,"Before the Devil Knows You're Dead is a depressing but well conceived story saddled with hugely overwrought acting by two main characters. From the overbearing bombastics of Philip Seymour Hoffman to the seething bug-catching stares of Albert Finney, this is one huge opportunity wasted. Hawke and Tomei do their best to rein in the proceedings, providing a quiet, suffering dignity to their tortured souls, but the excesses of the former just about kills the momentum generated by the story.By the time the last scene rolls around we want to take the pillow to both Finney and Hoffman. And Lumet for his jump-time storytelling technique. Tragic waste of a great opportunity."
1,Thank God for Fast Forward should've been the title!,Too make this short and bittersweet: Before the Devil Knows Your Dead is virtually unwatchable. Lumet relied on a lazy and tiresome series of flashbacks (think Vantage Point which does the same and is equally unwatchable) to tell the most depressing and unrealistic story I've ever been asked to suspend my disbelief for. The flashbacks are the laziest and most annoying way to try and narrate a story and it winds up being tedium instead of building drama. I will forget this garbage and instead remember Lumet for his earlier masterpieces.
2,"Disappointing, insistent, and hard to sit through","This was painful, and surprisingly so because it seems to have all the elements of being wonderful: an interesting plot, complex characters, clever director, and very talented actors. As soon as it was over, however, I was angry at having been duped into watching it. It (the film) is so aware of those surefire elements I named a moment ago, that it seemed fine with the fact that the scenes weren't going right, it wasn't believable, and it was hard for the audience to like or care about any of the characters. All in all, a waste of time and painfully so. I gave it two stars only because it was better than I would have done, were I a director."
2,Thriller,"This is a suspense thriller about a robbing of a jewel store. The owners are the cuplrits' mom and dad. Opens with a sex scene. Outside of a couple scenes of that, I wouldn't recommend it, but it wasn't a bad movie. Even though I would not want to see it again."
1,so terrible it's almost funny...but not,"I thought this movie was unwatchable! Great actors perform badly, and a fine director falls short. I'm all for sex and violence when it makes sense in the context of a well-thought-out plot, but the sex and violence in this movie was gratuitous and uninteresting. If I hadn't seen it with friends, I would have walked out thirty minutes in."
1,"Terrible, slow, tedious, bleak","Warning! THIS IS NOT A ""THRILLER""! It's an incredibly slow, depressing, tedious ""acting showcase"" with no point.I write this in the hope that some will be saved. Take heed!It's sad that, like the sermonette ""Lions for Lambs"", they felt they had to market it as a ""thriller"".There are NO ""twists"" or ""turns"", unless you can't see three feet in front of you. Did I mention it's SLOOOOOOOW? Absolutely horrible. And ""bleak"" doesn't even begin to describe how thoroughly depressing this movie is.As for all the comments about the acting, I really don't see what the big deal is. There's nothing done here that couldn't be done by, say, Tom Cruise.Don't say you weren't warned.UPDATE: A friend of mine took no heed and ... watched it. He lamented his folly afterward, to no consolation. I'm not kidding here, folks! It's absolutely slow, bleak, plodding, and otherwise horrible."
3,Dark with good acting,"Good acting, disturbing storyline, and well directed. However, the movie lacks resolution which leaves an uneasy feeling. Not sure if I would recommend it, but it is interesting to watch the story develop. The only great thing about this movie was Marissa Tomei's BODY... WHOA, she has one of the best looking figures in Hollywood (WOW!)."
3,unoriginal ending,"Hoffman and Hawke play 2 brothers. Because they need money, they plan a robbery, that goes wrong... very wrong.Hoffman and Hawke's performances are quite good, so is Marisa Tomei's and the other supportive actors'.The script isn't that original, you can predict what will happen, and it's really too bad, because there were many possibilities, and unfortunately the scriptwriters didn't choose an original ending.All in all, I can't really say I ""enjoyed"" this film, nor would I recommend it to anyone."
4,wow,I can't help but laugh when I read these reviews that say 'predicable plot.' When was the last time you saw a movie when the kids robbed their parents?Michael Clayton? Now THAT was a predictable plot. Bad lawyer turned good has been done to death.This movie is an overlooked good show.
3,Disturbing.,"I knew this film would be dark, but I wasn't prepared for how dark it turned out to be. The tension never lets up for almost two hours."
1,A dreadful movie,"I had high hopes for this one. Picked it up the day it hit the video stores. What an utter disappointment. The basic story, which is sliced into many erratic time sequences, is about a manipulative man who convinces his weaker brother to help him help rob a jewelry store. Things go wrong and keep going wrong as the story descends into hopeless despair. You end up liking no one and caring about no one. If you're like me, you reach a point where you just get up and turn it off. If I'm going to watch a mega-downer it had better have some purpose to it. This one doesn't."
4,DVD,"DVD took maximum time to be delivered, it arrived two weeks later than everything else ordered at the same time. Product was in condition advertised."
4,....very good,I will not bore you with another synopsis of this film. Unless you beg me to and then I will just do a c/p of someone else's.The open scene is quite the 'opening scene'....gets your attention.This film is very well done. It is a film that is 'dark'. Reminds me of a Cohen Bros Film. Other directors might might have kept it darker with the use of light.The cast does an excellent job.Some parents do not have good kids. Some kids don't have good parents. You decide. Some things just are. You decide.
2,Spend 2 Hours With The Worst Characters Ever Written,The positive reviews are fairly disturbing. Yes - the acting was good. Yes -- the production and direction were great. Yes - the movie was suspenseful. But these things cannot redeem the awful story the film portrays. I watched the entire 2 hours wanting something very miserable to happen to the two very miserable brothers. What loathsome creatures. No one except the mother and the father (for the most part) were sympathetic characters. The women who hung out with these guys needed medication and therapy. Perhaps the people who love this movie need the same!
2,Not awesome...,"Wasn't the best movie, wasn't aweful. It was very long, didn't think it would end. Not sure if i would recommend it to people unless they are movie buffs. I guess I had bigger expectations."
1,IS IT JUST ME - OR IS ETHAN HAWKE THE SLIMIEST LOOKING ACTOR IN THE WORLD????????,"I had the misfortune to purchase this movie at Blockbuster this weekend out of the bin 3 for $20 . . . While I love Sidney Lumet - when people describe this as a dark film - that is a complete understatement! Even Albert Finney (the true victim in this film) is totally unlikeable. As for the two brothers - I have long wondered what ANYONE could ever see in Ethan Hawke - he is so hideous to look at! I would rather look at Phillip Seymour Hoffman naked anyday- and believe me that is not a sight I ever want to see again, either. The acting and directing was first rate but all of the characters were so utterly devoid of any shred of decency - it was sooooooo dark and when it was over I just sat there wondering why I watched the whole thing. Don't bother - but if you have to rent it DON'T be stupid enough to buy it at ANY price!"
4,Similar to Thelma and Louise,"I was expecting a movie based on the overused theme of selling your sole to the devil. Surprisingly the movie was an intense drama that had more in common with theme of Thelma & Louise. It features two brothers who make a series of bad decisions and spiral ever deeper into a hole that they cannot climb out of. Although the movie was good, I tend not to enjoy this level of intensity in a movie. I do not need to be reminded how the choices we make can impact our lives and those around us. That's why I haven't looked at my 401k statement lately."
3,"meetting ties in a ""world of opprotunities""","Is this movie about non-grateful sons or selfish parents sleeping on money might then go to hell but making their closest relatives, offspring no bit happy?Sex is awful and film is long and boring colapsed in a drama must and could be avoided in less goods-rich but more spiritually abundant families."
4,When a simple plan goes terribly wrong,"If you enjoy movies involving robbery, schemes, and family betrayal...you'll love this one. Movies with a simple premise always wind up being best.... two guys....simple idea....chaos ensues. Always a winner because it happens everyday in real life. Guy Ritchie should take some direction from this film"
5,Dark Comedy Modern Noir,"I love this movie. The acting is uniformly excellent in every role; the writing and directing could not be better. The unraveling of the ""perfect crime"" is brilliantly comic. Without exception, every character, from Michael Shannon as the brother-in-law of the crime partner, the drug dealer, and all of the main actors, deliver excellent performances. If you try to single out the performance of Phillip Seymour Hoffman, then consider Ethan Hawke's performance, or Marissa Tomei, and on down the line. No, it is not a comedy in the usual sense, but it is definitlely comic in its story of realistic disaster. There are no false moves in this film, every wrong step is logical and acceptable in this world. ""It's too late for thinking"" is right!"
3,Lumet's talent shines through.,"Director, Lumet, is so very skilled. He brings a tension to this film that is maintained throughout. The doom and gloom adds and supports the tension. I am not a fan of P. Seabass Hoffman. You know those actors that - for whatever reason - just rub you the wrong way and you just can't watch them? Well, Mr. Hoffman is one of those actors for me. I loved THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY, but thank goodness Hoffman's character was knocked off early on, or I might have had a completely different take on that film. I tried watching BEFORE THE DEVIL... one time with a friend. We both weren't into it, so it was a year before I gave it another shot on my own, because I am a fan of Lumet, and I think that the cast - for the most part - is so very good."
1,"Depressing, dark and hopeless","While I normally like Lumet's work, this movie was utterly without any sense of hope. As such, it was an exercise in depression. Hawke and Hoffman's characters were without any meaningful redeeming virtues. This was apparently supposed to convey a sense of realism, but it comes across as ""reality"" TV. If you want to be depressed, watch this film. If you're seeking to be entertained, buy something else."
1,Rental,Never knew it was a rental. Good price and keeping it but disappointed. Make sure to not make the same mistake.
3,social decay and cannibalism,"I have no trouble with the acting in this movie,but the theme is just really nasty.Members of a family that is decaying beforeyour eyes make this a very hard movie to watch.There is also the explicit sex and violencethat starts and ends the movie.All the flashbacks and seeing the action from different points of view just make it worse. For the subject matter the script is wellwritten as well and the cast, setting andeverything else is well done.The movie just sucks as a subject..."
2,Mining The Depths Of Stupidity,"Listen, Man. This sure had all the indicators of a promising few hours, with the cast and director having proved themselves through the years. It's impossible to feel any sympathy for any of the characters in this film, 'cuz they're all either too selfish or stupid to exist. Good acting? Sure, but to what end? The movie jumps back & forth in a very distracting manner, and Hawke's character is darn dumb I wanted to rip him outta the TV and strangle him. Believability is shot early on in this lame attempt at suspense. Several loose ends, but really it don't matter, because at least the agony is over. Marisa's lovely presence is the only reason I sat through it to the end. Lame, lame, lame otherwise. Wanna sey Hoffman in something worthwhile, get Love Liza or Owning Mahoney. Avoid this stinkbomb."
2,I Wish I Was Dead,"I lost interest so early in the film. There was lots of jumping around, and back and forth in time which wasn't really hard to follow -- but it seemed excessive. The premise of the film seemed interesting, but the followthrough was so far off the mark -- like perhaps a high school kid wrote the script. Too many odd characters when they were not necessary. The redeeming 2 stars I gave this were for the ending. While there is one aspect of the film that just leaves you hanging... ""like, hey -- so what about him? what happens to him?"" There is one very suprising incident to close out the story that I did not see coming. I will try to steer clear of this write and directors films for some time..."
1,Does Good Acting Redeem This Film?,"This is a squalid,ugly drama. 2 brothers conspire to rob their parents, one presumably because he can't afford child support, the other because he can't afford his drug habits. Everything goes predictably wrong. Both of them sleeping with Marisa Tomei, a brilliant actress who's ability is pretty much wasted in this part.The plot is the familiar jewelry store robbery gone wrong, told in flashbacks, done much better IMO in films like Reservoir Dogs, where at least the shifting loyalties of the repellent characters keep you interested.There's nothing redeeming here. 2 hours of downward spiral, with an overly melodramatic score and Hoffman looking sad and Hawke looking scared and stupid. That's all folks. Lifetime channel material with some sex and violence, and the cast plays their thin roles dutifully.Enjoy."
4,good camera when not connected,"I love these clicksmart cameras. I had a 510 before, and it got stolen so I got this to replace it. Its supposed to be a step up from the 510, but the only grip I have on it is that the live feed to the computer is grainy. Even the pics that come out when attached to the computer is grainy. I've checked all settings and it is still the same. The 510 didn't have this problem. Pictures taken when not connected come out great."
1,a manifesto for political impotence,"In ""A Lasting Peace"" author Daisaku Ikeda, president of Soka Gakkai International, proffers that spiritual enlightenment rather than direct political action is the key to world of peace.Rather than providing eloquent insights into constructing a credible and perdurable peace, Mr. Ikeda has written a manifesto for political impotence and alienation and a recipe for the blind-faith adherance to the dictates of incorporeal hierarchs.""A Lasting Peace"" and its phlegmatic attempts at elucidating a vision of a harmonious future without war is a disappointing failure when compared to other luminary works such as Emmanuel Kant's ""Perpetual Peace"" or Thomas Pangle's ""Justice Among Nations : On the Moral Basis of Power and Peace."""
3,If you enjoy cleaning your stove,"This is a well made saucepan that heats up fast and cleans easily. My only complaint with it is that everytime I use it I end up having to clean my stove. The sides are straight up and down and the lid which is tight fitting does not have a vent. So, invariably whatever you put in it percolates up and flows out the sides. Leaving the lid slightly askew would normally alleviate the problem, but in this case it just allows you to aim the mess more accurately."
1,I have a question,"Hello. I lost my charger Zire 72. I don't remember the voltage out (volts),current in and current out (Amperes). Can you tell me about these dates?Can you tell me if the Garmin AC could damage my zire 72?"
4,It works,"After a year of searching for a charger that works for my Palm Zire 72, I finally found this one... Thank God it work...!!!"
2,Pads are ok but the velcro straps failed,"Before finishing one roof the velcro straps failed. The pads themselves seemed to be working out, however, I returned one of two pairs before 2 weeks of use because the stitching holding the velcro pulled away."
3,which one is right for me,"This sounds like a great line of knee pads. However, from the pictures and description it is very difficult to tell what the diffrences are between the models. (1002F, 1003F, 1004F)"
2,"masters of chant, chapter 3","When the cd came it was not the cd i ordered. The music on the disc was not the music on the case. I sent it back. The cover and the disc matched but it not the same. The Master of Chant, chapter 3 have good music on it but the disc i recelved wdid not have the same music"
5,A shocking expose of education malpractice,"In 1955, Rudolf Flesch was blackballed by education's ""cognitive elite"" with the publication of his ""Why Johnny Can't Read,"" which warned that the look-say reading method would cause widespread dyslexia and reading disability. Mr. Flesch was prophetic indeed, and the public schools never heeded his call to restore intensive, systematic phonics. Obviously, the smug education establishment will not appreciate ""The Whole Language/OBE Fraud"" either, since Mr. Blumenfeld equates their use of whole-language (an ""enhanced"" version of the dubious look-say method) with educational malpractice, and uses their own words to prove it. Although Mr. Blumenfeld is a conservative, facts are facts . . . and the facts are that whole-language is a very dangerous way to teach a child a read. This book should be read by all parents who wonder why their son or daughter has been labeled dyslexic or reading-disabled. Finally, a voice of reason in education."
5,Great price. Gift for my mom,"This is my mom's favorite fragrance. It is usually in department stores with little discount and very limited online for less. It is not an old lady smell, but definitely for the mature woman. I could see my wife (30) wearing this. The price on Amazon was great with the super saver shipping. Good gift for wife or mom."
2,Poor picture quality,"Pros: It lights up and displays stuff.Cons: Tested on two different PCs, it has poor gamma and gray-scale tracking. Near-whites are clipped into white. The MagicTune software can mostly correct these issues, but it is a pain to use. I use this monitor with my laptop, and whenever I use the laptop's own internal display, MagicTune forgets all about the monitor settings when I reconnect the 204B. I've gotta open the app, and a bunch of clicks later I have its gamma correction re-enabled. Every time. And, occasionally the monitor thinks it's not connected to anything (displays ""check cable"" or somesuch) when it is connected. I have to power-cycle the monitor to fix."
2,Alright for a normal computer,"The Samsung SyncMaster 204b is alright for any normal computer. If you use 1280x1024 resolution however, you will be really pissed off. Don;t buy if your looking for a gaming monitor. Bad for graphic designers too. Good for use in normal family computer needs despite it's 1600x1200x32 problem."
1,Piece of garbage,I had to replace this monitor 4 times before I gave up and got my money back.From dead pixels to horizontal black lines to parts falling apartSamsung lost it on this one.
1,Unforgiveable manufacturing defects,"I am now on my third one of these, and all have had the same horrible defect: when using the digital (DVI) input, the image randomly flickers off and on at unpredictable times. It is incredibly annoying, and gives me a headache as well as interferes with my work.Many others on the internet have had this exact problem with versions of this monitor manufactured in China from August 2006 to date. Samsung knows about this problem, and continues to ship out these bad monitors. When I called for an exchange, I specifically asked for one made in Mexico (which do not have this defect) and they still shipped me one from China! Needless to say, it was flickering within minutes of plugging it in.I recommend not buying this monitor until Samsung gets its act together and stops shipping known-broken monitors and wasting its customers' time."
3,Horrible For Web Designers!,"If someone on here claims to be a web designer and says this is a great monitor for those who deal in graphics, they are lying about the monitor or lying about themselves.This monitor has a serious vertical viewing problem that is noticeable on ALL units! The top is always darker than the bottom and it can not be fixed!Of course, the casual user may not notice this or may not care. If you just want to make use of the 5ms response time to play games or surf the net and want to save some money, this may not be a bad choice.To a graphic designer like myself though, the viewing angle problem is VERY noticeable. Get the monitor only if such things don't bother you. If you're meticulous about a consistant display or work in graphics, you will return this thing within the week. Guaranteed."
2,"Save your money, buy something else","Like many other reviewers here, I too experienced problems when using this monitor in DVI mode. With VGA it was fine. I tried different computers, cables, monitors etc in a string of irritating troubleshooting scenarios.The problem is definitely this monitor. Screen craps out and goes to black, flickers, comes back, etc...until it finally will not work at all until you go back to VGA mode. It was definitely NOT the cable. Other monitors worked fine with my system and video card.If you have a MacBook Pro there are some definite compatibilty issues in DVI mode with this monitor. Get something else and save yourself the headache. Read the other reviews, this thing is a dud."
2,Not suited for Graphics,"For the money this Monitor is great, especially if you are using it just for surfing or word-processing! It has some of the best specs out there such as very fast response and natural looking colors.HOWEVER, its not the right choice for pro-level graphic design or photo editing. The viewing angle is so limited that there is a major vertical shift in brightness of the screen. No matter how I adjust, the top of the screen remains significantly darker than the bottom. The contrast is on this thing is also a problem. It's not balanced and although colors seem rich, a lot of detail is lost.If you are doing graphics related work, save yourself the headache. My unit is going back tomorrow!"
1,Monitor has dead pixel problems.,"This monitor worked perfectly for the first 3 weeks. Was absolutely satisfied with price & quality. Unfortunately after 3 weeks, I had an entire horizontal line of dead pixels right in the middle of the screen. My first samsung purchase & I am not happy that I have to get a refund from samsung because they are out of stock on this model. I have been informed that the refund will take anywhere between 6 to 8 weeks. So what they are telling me is that I will have to ship back the monitor & wait 8 weeks to get a refund & in the interim I wont have a monitor. Very very upset."
4,Not the best I've read....,"But certainly not the worst. It had a nice little plot, but a tad on the predicitable side as the story went on an on."
4,"In my opinion worth it for the ""Ring of Fire"" cover alone!","This is a great album, but not for the casual listener. If the only reason you like Wall of Voodoo is their hit ""Mexican Radio"", stick to the Call of the West album.I want to say that the cover of Ring of Fire is a sterling example of what a cover song should be. It's not just re-played, it's re-invented; other examples would be Devo's cover of the Stone's ""Satisfaction"", Nirvana's cover of Devo's ""Turnaround"", Frente's cover of ""Bizarre Love Triangle"", the Damned/Motorhead's cover of ""Ballroom Blitz"" and Rasputina's cover of ""Brand New Key"". I could go on, but Wall of Voodoo's ring of fire is something special.If you think you'll like the quirkyness of early Devo spiced with the flavor of spaghetti western music, you'll like this. Otherwise I can't recommend it."
3,Great teachings for small groups,"I received this DVD to review free.I enjoyed this film and the simple statements the narrator gives, as well as the great visuals of Jesus...This is a good DVD that you could use for teaching supplemental material for small groups etc...My only issue, and it is small, is that I don't know this teacher.I have nothing against what he said in the episodes I was given to review; yet I don't know him.I don't want to promote a preacher or speaker that I am not familiar with."
3,All together a wholesome family movie targeted towards kids.,"Heaven Sent is about a young boy named Eddie who is always getting into trouble. He ends up dead and an inexperienced angel is sent to help him, Howard. Howard teaches Eddie what he should be doing and how to live. I thought this movie was either take it or leave it type of thing. Some people loved it and others didn't. It's targeted towards kids but it's a good family movie to watch together. In the end it might be complicated for children to comprehend. Seeing as I didn't get it myself! But it was a good movie. Just not for all types of people. And it definately wasn't Vincent Kartheiser's best movie!"
5,uno dei migliori,"è uno dei migliori film che io abbia mai visto, è sicuramente da vedere in particolare per coloro che hanno avuto una qualche storia di mare. baci a tutti romina"
1,This DVD runs aground,"This DVD stinks. You would think after 10 years they could come up with at least a couple of more things to put on the DVD. There is the movie, scene selections, and that's it! Not even the trailer is on this DVD, which is interesting. I lived in Malaysia for a while (I was living on sailboats at the time :) and I rented a movie there that had a trailer for Captain Ron. Of the 4 scenes that were in that trailer 3 of them were not in the VHS version of Captain Ron that I bought about 8 years ago, and they are not in this DVD version either. Were they in the movie when it was in the theaters? This DVD fails to answer the burning question: What happened to the dinghy?? It's a great movie -- one of my favorites -- but I was pretty disappointed by this DVD."
2,"Vapid -- a few smiles, no guffaws","How low a threshold of laughter do some of these reviewers have? This movie isn't TERRIBLE, but there are no laugh-out-loud moments in it and it feels very contrived. ""One of the funniest movies I've ever seen""? C'mon, Chaz... ""Back to the Future,"" though perhaps usually categorized as Sci-Fi Fantasy/Adventure, is a hundred times funnier than ""Captain Ron."""
4,Entertaining movie,A light hearted comedy worth viewing. Marting Short and Kurt Russell are a good combination. Nice views of places in the Caribean.
5,A must for anyone who has ever cruised on a small boat.,"If you have ever spent any time on a boat, especially in the open water this video will strike a note."
5,Best comedy of all time!!!!!,This movie is amazing. Every time I watch I laugh. I did not know it was on dvd. At the end of this movie you will be glad you bought it. One of martin shorts best films ever.
4,Good Movie,We've had this movie for several years and watch it 2-3 times a year. I bought this copy for a friend who is a boat captain on a 72 footer. He and his wife loved it too. Good clean fun.
3,!The height of bad movies!,"oh boy.. Captain Ron.. What can I say about Captain Ron.. I have one question for everyone.. has Kurt Russel ever made a good movie? if he has, this isn't one of them.. I mean Escape from new york/L.A we're bad.. but they were so bad that they was funny! but captain ron tries to be funny.. and that where it fails.. miserably. It's the story of a family that inherits a boat.. they go on a trip with a ""wacky"" guide (Russel) and crazy fun family high jinks ensew.. ugh.. that hurt.. This movie is soo freakin' bad.. Kurt Russel is a bad actor.. and that usually adds to the good of a movie, Example: Escape movies.. The only movie he was good in was The Thing.. Now another error they made was making Kurt Russel a wacky guy and Martin Short a serious character.. I mean common! whats wrong with that? I gotta go watch ghoulies or something, must cleanse (sp?) my brain.."
2,Captain Yawn!,"Mary Kay Place - YUM. Martin Short - YUK!I should have known better but the $5 price tag was there for a reason. Now I can add to my collection of DVD's in the garage that include Zachariah, Trinity/Trinity/Trinity, and Lord of the Rings, Mean Machine, and the Wild Bunch....all duds, like this turkey.I cant fault Kurt Russell, he's actually pretty good in this role but he doesnt have any material to work with. Very little humor here except for the beer drinking Monopoly playing 10 year old. Sort of reminded me of my old childhood. But that's about it. You've been warned."
3,Typical comedy - You'll laugh but wonder why you spent the time,"This is a good movie to say it briefly. It's a good comedy, it has some family - gee whiz factors to it, as well as a few scenes that are extremely predictable, but overall it's just a fun movie. My wife didn't want to watch it, but after forcing her to watch it, she enjoyed it as well.Great movie to showcase the TRUE Pirates of the Carribean. :)This movie is similar to the Great Outdoors meets Overboard"
4,Great film!,"All Martin Harvey(Martin Short) wanted to do was take his wife and their two children on a nice houseboat vacation. But then came along ""Captain Ron"" Reaco(Kurt Russell). Captain Ron is a swab who serves as a slave to the Harveys,thus calling Martin ""Boss"". After the Harveys' vacation ends,Captain Ron remains aboard other vessels,to of course,serve as a slave."
5,Best Caribbean Film . . . Ever.,"Captain Ron is probably the greatest vacation movie ever. Kurt Russell plays Captain Ron who serves as a local ship captain sailing the Harvey's boat. Martin Short is Mr. Harvey, he steals many of the scenes with hilarious dialogue. However, Kurt Russell steals the rest of the film. Captain Ron is a wild movie with funny situations, and clever dialogue. It is also a very beautiful movie; Captain Ron and the Harveys sail the boat through some of the most beautiful and scenic Caribbean locations. Buy this DVD today, you will not regret it."
5,great get out of the city adventure movie!,too bad you cant get the movie anymore!!!!?! sure would like to buy my own copy.......
5,Captain Ron,Love this movie fun and more fun.so happy I can get it so fast from you and so inexspensively!Debbie and Rob van Dijk
3,GREAT MOVIE!,"""If we get lost...we'll just pull in somewhere's and ask for directions""....A classic, must watch. The only downside if you buy it is Amazon doesn't let you download the movie unless you watch it on the crappy "" box"" player."
1,Would not play wrong area,"Would not play it my DVD player will not read the disc, wrong area, I'm in the united states and it will only play in other side of the world. It's junk for me."
4,Fun Sea Voyage,"Captain Ron has always been my favorite movie. But the reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of partial nudity, and four letter words (I hate four letter words) in front of the children and said by the children. They cut things like this out when they show movies on tv and I had no idea that was in there. But I still love the movie and recommend it to everyone. Kurt Russell really makes his character come alive. And Martin Short is soooo funny. I guarantee you will laugh!"
5,Please put this movie on DVD!,"This movie is a must see classic, very funny! Hopefully it will be released on DVD."
1,Could be a worthless pile of junk if it breaks,"I apologize if this is an American made chair. It doesn't say where it is manufactured. I bought one that looks identical for the discounted price advertised here and it was Chinese made. No dealer network or service centers located or offered in poorly written brochure that came with it. After very light usage, the chair back broke and the electronics quit. When I turned it over, the whole plastic housing containing the drive rod that reclines the back had completely disentigrated and will necessitate replacement. Only website showing the model number RT-Y005 Health Message Chair was a Chinese wholesaler that is set up for large importers. It looks like this chair is being imported and renamed. If it is, don't waste your money, Goodwill won't even want it the way it is."
1,Chair not as functional as other chairs,"If I was to choose again, I would choose either the IJoy or the HT---I have tried both at the furniture store and they provide much better massage, control and functionality. Lesson learned review product before buying--this chair is not worth anything close to $2000"
1,HORRIBLE CHAIR!!!!!!!!!!!,"The back of the chair was already broken when it was delivered. They refused to take it back and do not provide any service for it. I paid so much money and don't know what to do with this expensive, dysfunctional chair. Don't waste your money!!!!!!!!"
2,Embrace the Mediocrity,"The aural equivalent of sitting in a windowless room smelling your own farts. Thing is, after a while they're not so bad. I think Smog & Mr Callahan's stuff is kind of indicative of what's going on in general now-a-days, which is a mass of banal and average art being published by the truckload because people will buy it. Admittedly it is true: after listening to some of these they grow on you, but is that opening up to the music or a starving man thinking a saltine cracker is the best thing he's ever tasted? And ""people who don't listen to smog should"" definitely *not* ""just shut up."", as this site is about helping those unfamiliar with a band spend their hard earned cash wisely. What does it matter what you write about music anyway? So to that end maybe we should all just shut the F up and let the play button speak for itself to the individual listener."
4,"Lovely, subtle spookiness","I don't usually seek out ""scary"" fiction, but I was looking for a gift for my son (a teen) and bought this one. He hasn't tried it yet, but I have been eagerly reading the stories. My favorite was also ""Playmate"", but all of the stories are good.It should be noted that all of these stories were written quite a while ago. This means that the language is more complex and even maybe seems a little stilted to modern ears, but on the other hand, this is very high-caliber writing, and the language is a joy. (Many readers will have their vocabulary stretched just a little) I found the writing style to be an inspiration for my own writing. This is a very good collection!"
3,Some fun stories,"This was a book club assignment and I was skeptical. However, there were some good stories in here. The forward was particularly interesting as it gave a history of ghost story writing."
3,Not so scary stories,"I got this book during the Halloween season because I wanted a book of genuine ghost stories that would really creep me out. Overall, the stories were not scary. They were all ""ghost"" stories beacuse they all had something un-explainable happen in the end which could only be contributed to the presence of a ghost. This book is a collection of ghost stories, however the stories are not scary or creepy so if that is what you are looking for, this book is not for you."
2,Dissappointed,"This boo had notations and markings in it...I think they should not rate the book as ""very good""... thats considered ""good""...."
3,introduced me to a few authors i'll read more of,"most of the stories in this book i could have done without. i found them boring and not the least bit frightening. i loved the edith wharton story (just buy her book of ghost stories), and the rosemary timperley stories were great too!more disturbing than any of the stories was dahl's sexist introduction. he waxes lyrical on how women authors are kept out of the literary canon, because men really have the upperhand in that area, but ladies sure can write a creepy story. i was incredibly irritated.this book gets 3 stars instead of one because it peaked my interest in ghost stories written by victorian women writer's- aside from that, it was pretty blah.and don't get me wrong, i've always been a fan of his, and have read quite a lot of his books, but the sexist remarks dampened my admiration.i strongly suggest flipping through this one before purchasing it."
5,Another great book from the T.S. Eliot of fantasy.,"How do you mix tarot cards, gangsters and arthurian legend into a cohesive whole? You need to have the depth and knowledge of language that Mr Powers has. Whereas his long time fans will already be convinced towards this book's strengths, I recommend giving it to those who think fantasy novels are a matter of sweaty barbarians."
4,Excellent Read,"Reminded me of that cool TV mini-series, ""The Lost Room"" - not quite as ""epic"" as ""Declare"" but a must-read for Tim Powers fans nonetheless."
4,Bringing magic into everyday!!,"An interesting tale that uses Tarot images to sanctify everyday aspects of existence. Powers offers an emotionally rich plotline which he fleshes out into grand themes of loss, redemption, and the meaning of family.Although he delves into the darker side of human relationships, Powers manages to deliver an exciting upbeat tale which kept my attention to the end."
2,I don't get it.,"After reading the other reviews posted here, I feel like I must have read a different book than the other reviewers. Ridiculous, stereotypical characters; one of the principal ""bad guys"" eats only raw, recently living food, including, at one point, the carcass of his recently killed doberman. An ""ending"" composed of the most amazing series of unlikely coincidences that I have ever read. I laughed, I cried (or at least I snickered and groaned), but probably not in the places that the author intended."
2,Not for non-sci-fi fans,"I can't stand most science fiction, but I tried this because it seemed more literary than sci-fi, and I'm a poker player. It's an interesting book, but the literary part does not outweigh the sci-fi, and there really isn't much said about poker."
3,"Seriously, what's with the title?","OK, does this album have the worst, most overwrought and pretentious title ever? I think I wanted to dislike the album for that reason but damn, it's actually very good. Emo/pop-punk doesn't have a reputation for being 'art' or being conducive to progressive elements but Coheed and Cambria are set upon changing that. Still a bit too pop for my tastes, but it's a cut above most other bands of a similar ilk."
2,The 'musically stunted mans Dream Theater'!,"As a prog and metal rock fan for over 30 years, I tried real hard to like this enigmatic release, but in my opinion it falls short on many levels. The vocalist is horrendous. He has been compared to Geddy Lee by many, but Geddy's voice has a LOT more soul, timbre, and smoothness. Comparisons to Dream Theater have also been made as well, but C&C's chord progressions and guitar work sound purposeless and disjointed, and DO have elements of the lousy 'Emo rock' genre. The fact that many here bring this up must mean many of us hear it. I applaud bands that try to 'push or break the musical envelope', but unfortunately, C&C's sound comes across as confused with no real musical direction. You can play with fervor and conviction, as these guys do, BUT if the music sounds forced and boring, there's nothing you can do to 'connect' with some listeners. Not my cup of tea."
5,Incredible,"I have been an avid Coheed listener since Second Stage Turbine Blade. I have been waiting for this CD since I heard it was coming out.I have to admit that this cd was nothing that I wanted to hear when I first bought it. I thought that Coheed had taken a seriously wrong turn in their development.Boy was I wrong; I kept listening to this CD despite my disapointment and absolutelty fell in love. I began to realize the complexity as well as the absolute beauty of this cd the more I listened.If you have any interest in this style of music give this cd a chance, it will change your life. The lyrics, the harmony, the cd; absolutely amazing!"
5,Awesome.,"More serious and heavier than the last albums. Definitely the best. Very catchy. Every time I hear ""The Suffering"" or ""Ten Speed"" I get chills. Totally addicting. Somebody said in one of these reviews that ""Welcome Home"" was a rip off of ""Kashmir"". I'm pretty sure that Jimmy Page used his guitar in a violin kind of way, and I'm positive that Claudio and Travis used harmonics. In any case the songs really don't sound alike at all. Now back to the point, Coheed and Cambria have always been awesome, but this time they're showing off. We all win."
5,Amazing,"I've been a casual Co & Ca fan for the past year and a half or so and I've always enjoyed their music for Claudio's unique voice and the group's distinctive sound, but this album blew me away. I had heard a few of the tracks before the CD was released, so I was really looking forward to it.. which could have been a bad thing if the album hadn't lived up to my expectations. But suffice it to say, it did not disappoint me at all. It's definitely an album that you can play from start to finish, over and over again. And I think it's intriguing to follow the story as it progresses. For those who don't know, the band's albums follow the sci-fi/fantasy story of a husband and wife (Coheed and Cambria) that's being told in four parts. Sanchez is also writing comic books to accompany them. I picked up the graphic novel for ""Good Apollo"" today and it's great. If you like their sound even a little bit, pick this album up. It is an instant classic."
5,Basically On Repeat in my iPod!,"I have to admit that I didn't like 'The Suffering' the first time I heard it on 'Rock' radio a while back. I thought, Who are these guys cribbing so blatantly from Geddy Lee and Prog Rock in general?Then I got 'Good Apollo, I'm Burning...' and it has pretty much been in my CD player and on my iPod nonstop ever since.Granted, it is a form of music that has a certain 'learning curve', so I can't say it's for everyone. But once you get into the music, you are effectively hooked on it.The most intriguing element of the songwriting may perhaps be the geekiest, as well. Thematic, sci-fi lyrics set in a world that these guys have made up. Wow. It's almost unfathomably compelling.I recommend this to anyone who's willing to experiment with his/her boundaries. For fans of Prog Rock, Mars Volta, etc."
4,Newest from Coheed,"great CD. I never really payed much attention to the Intros. but Keeping the Knife is an awesome song. Welcome Home was the first release, and it is a kickass song. The Suffering is probably my favorite song on the disc. Good stuff here for Coheed fans, and good stuff for new fans alike."
3,Its okay,"I frist heard one of the songs on mtv2, I fell in love with the sound. So, I got the cd and was a bit dissapointed. Its so boring! On, on and on! I think they may want a new writer because Claudio Sanchez needs some help. But it dose has a few good songs my favorite, wake up."
2,in case you were looking for metal...,"i saw this album in the music store when i was looking for the latest rock/metal releases, and gave it a listen. i'm an openminded guy, and i can see the appeal, but i would assume this music would appeal to the sort of people who read comics, watch japanese-animated cartoons, and are aged under 15. if you think you might be interested in this, but are age 15+, i suggest you check out opeth etc. oh and look forward to the new tool album. is it out yet? is it?"
1,"Oh, how the mighty have fallen","I can't believe the band that wrote the utterly amazing and timeless album, The Second Stage Turbine Blade, could release an album as bad as this. The only redeeming quality of this are the first three tracks (two of which are introductory). Welcome Home is the only real song off of this album that is worth listening to. The rest is just pretentious garbage.Biggest disappointment of 2005."
1,Not what I expected,"If you heard the song ""welcome home"" on the preview for the movie ""nine"" and wanted more of the same then you will be disappointed. That song is a one off. In fact in the preview they omit the singing along with a lot of boring repetitions parts. The singing is high pitched and silly sounding. Singing can be overlooked (death metal fans), however the songs on the rest of the album are just boring. They have none of the pantomime and as one review put it, urgency, of welcome home. It kind of sounds like watered down My Chemical Romance, which isn't a stellar band to begin with."
5,More greatness from Co&Ca,"Their third release, and it does not let down in the slightest. More insight is given into the epic story the albums play out. Not really much to say except this is great cd on its own or even if you're just the slightest bit interested in Coheed."
5,Coheed's 2nd best album,"I would rank this only behind SSTB in awesomeness. Probably the album that you want to introduce your friends to first, if they've never heard of coheed. Easily the most ""prog"" out of their albums with the last few songs but still poppy enough that mainstreamers will like it. Overall just classic coheed and I have this album on repeat at work all the time. -One of the Children of the Fence"
1,A Huge Disappointment,"I've never listened to this band before but when I heard ""Welcome Home"" on the radio, I decided to give'em a shot. The album is lousy. They do have some Dream Theater sound infused in the mix but at least Dream Theater's GOOD! To me, C&C's disc sounds alot like Alien Ant Farm bullsh*t. AVOID!!"
1,give me a break,"i saw the hosers in concert and they wish they were the best band on equal vision record(Bear VS Shark). They are a Mars Volta Rip-off band that wish they were half as talented. this singer sounds like he's ""trying"" to sing in that tone and isnt naturaly gifted enough to pull it off. Look, any butthole with synth can make a well rounded album, but jesus christ dont make it so bluntly obvious that someone is holding your hand!"
1,WORST CRAP EVER,This is the worst display of emo crap ever. I have to suffer and hear my brother play this terrible record over and over again. Stupid emo garbage. DON'T BUY IT.
3,depends on what you want out of it,"For the non-academic: a well-written, detailed accounting of a digital world, giving the reader a strong grasp of the unique culture and sensibilities. Taylor helps illustrate where the real and the virtual connect and where they stay distinct, as well as raising up potential issues while arguing away others.For the academic: shallow, meandering, without really any big argument - pure ethnography. If you play games, you already know all this and have likely read books/articles that attack the subject better. If you don't, you should probably ask a student or a professor who does and they'll steer you in a better direction."
5,Works,"I bought mine at the big box store, but it does work as advertised. My elderly, housebound neighbors were allowing invasive Ailanthus (aka Tree of Heaven, aka Stink Tree) to grow next to their fence. You can't cut them down because that makes more shoots sprout up. I sprayed a 15-20 foot weed tree on the leaves and trunk with two hoses full every day for a week, then waited. After 4-6 weeks it was dead, dead, dead. You get quite a reach with the narrow setting on the sprayer as well, maybe four feet."
4,Newest rock bands must learn something about these guys.,"""Butterfly"" -Hollies'1967 album- is a must. But ""For Certain Because..."" is a real gem and you have to listen this one if you want to hear some of the finest vocal harmonies of all time and incredible tunes like the protest ""What's Wrong With The Way I Live?"" , the beautiful ""Pay You Back With Interest"" and many others. Sadly, I don't hear melodies like these in the radio nowadays."
4,great fun- but not enough tracks....,"We recently bought this for our son who just turned 3. We are still setting it up for him- but he enjoys racing the megablock cars as well as all his matchbox cars down the ramps. Especially long tracks can be built by keeping the lid on top of the box- and building down off of that. However,we and both our friends who have this say the same thing- they didn't include enough tracks or ramp supports! We have all used our other megablocks to prop up ramps and make more than one ramp usable at a time. A little skimpy."
4,Not Enough Pieces,"The toy is very engaging and my grand-nephew has great fun with it. The frustrating part is that there are not enough pieces to make a complete layout. No matter how you put it together, tracks end abruptly because there are not enough risers or transition pieces which meet smoothly."
3,Very fun but needs more tracks to add on,"I think this toy is very fun to play with for my 2 year old. But, I think there could be more tracks to add on and make it a bigger track."
4,needs more pieces,"I agree with the previous two reviews. It definitely needs more pieces. My son loves this thing! I've been searching for more pieces, when I noticed the reviews from other parents saying they have looked as well.MORE PIECES!!! PLEASE!!!"
2,Tracks are too narrow.,"This seems like a great toy overall and my 3 year old son really enjoys it. However, on his set the tracks and ramps are too narrow for the cars, so he has to push them to get them to move at all. Since the other reviewers didn't seem to have this problem I would still recommend the toy, but suggest you save your receipt just in case."
5,Grandson loves it!,This is the one gift my grandson keeps playing with time and time again. It is sturdy for a little boys hands and rough playing manner. He loved it so much this is the second one I have bought for him.
5,A awesome Book!!!!!!!,I just finished this book! It was the bomb!! I checked it out from my school library one day and finished it the next. Then i decided to buy 3 copies of the book here on amazon. And i read it over and over again. If could i would give it 100000000000 stars!!! BUY THIS BOOK!~!~
4,Shakespeare's Secret,"Shakespeare's Secret by Elise Broach is about a girl named Hero Netherfield. When Hero meets an old woman named Mrs. Roth, who has many stories to share, Hero learns that she lives in a house that possibly has a diamond hidden in it. The missing diamond belongs to a 500-year old necklace, with a mystery dating back to the time of William Shakespeare. This book is exciting and surprising. I loved it!After hearing of this missing diamond, Hero and her new friend Danny are on a hunt to solve the Murphy Diamond mystery. With Mrs. Roth's help, Hero and Danny learn more about the history of William Shakespeare.I liked this book because it occurred in the modern time and the characters are very real. Shakespeare's Secret is a great mystery!"
4,Replacing a Tattered Copy,My wife has used this book so much over the years that my purchase was to replace a copy of the book that had fallen apart! Many simple meals from this cookbook have become family regulars.
4,"Bernstein Does Brahms - Good, Even If Not Truly Inspired","This CD of Brahms' Symphony No.1 is a live concert recording from 1983. Leonard Bernstein leads the Vienna Philharmonic in a well-played performance that is good but not necessarily a classic. This doesn't mean that the concert is just merely competent or phoned in, it is *good*, it's just that Bernstein rarely makes you sit up and take real notice. The all-digital sound from DG is very good - the sonics are very clear and surprisingly - given that this is a live recording - there is no coughing heard in the audience (the bane of live classical recordings everywhere).If you like this recording of Brahms' first, you should probably get Bernstein's recordings of the other symphonies (which you can get separately or in a boxset). If you want something different you might want to check out Solti or (as long as you don't mind the old mono sound) the great Furtwängler."
2,Not for all Sawzalls......,"Hmm the product in itself is OK, however my Sawzall M18 Cordless did not fit.Well instead of hasseling with a return, I actually succeeded in pressing the Sawzall into the opposite end of the case. Not nice, but it is there. And I managed to close itHad I known this, I would not have chosen it.The text - when buying - does not give any indication that the M18 does not fit."
2,does not fit orbital models,Nice case but it does not fit orbital models as stated in the product description--I had to modify the inside of the case to fit the saw in...not very happy about that.
5,A Delightful Book,"Barbara Morris captures the joys, wonders and tears of owning a pet in this quick and delightful read. My husband and I recently put our cat, Carmella, to sleep. I came home from the vet and re-read the section in the book in which Morris and her husband face the same agonizing decision. I found the author's words both authentic and comforting.If you're a cat owner, or have ever been ""owned"" by a cat, you'll enjoy reading this tale of one couple's journeys all over the world, and how the cats they lived with made their house, wherever it was, a home."
1,Not buying this kind of DVD -- EVER again,"Please tell the folks who make DVDs that I am not wasting one thin dime on this kind of crud. No extras, no widescreen, crappy transfers.I call Disney every couple months to complain about movies I love being subjected to this treatment. Please feel free to call them, or better yet write them and explain how they're affected their bottom line with this tactic.You'll feel better. And who knows, maybe one day they'll stop."
1,love this movie,"As a member of this time period, I loved this movie and recommend it to all the teenagers who work for me in place of the, ""She's all That"" which I felt was just not as good as this. I must agree that until this movie appears in the Widescreen version I am not interested but will be first in line when and if it does. I only buy widescreen in dvd and dvd is all I buy."
4,Great find,"My daughter was looking everywhere for this dvd. I was so happy to find it on Amazon, it made a great Christmas gift"
1,please stop making DVDs like this!,"Ditto on the widescreen issue. Furthermore, I had to read a bunch of reviews b/c Amazon doesn't have the aspect ratio details.A classic movie, deserving of a true original aspect ratio transfer to DVD. If I want pan and scan, I'll rent the VHS thank you.I'm so sick of pan and scan DVDs. They are honestly not worth the price of a Whopper with cheese. 3.5 star movie, 0 star DVD.It makes you wonder who's in charge of creating these DVDs at the major studios...this is just pathetic.Amazon also needs to clearly mark this DVD as 1.33:1 aspect ratio!!!"
5,Great Movie,This is one of my favorite movies of all time. It really brings you back to high school and is very accurate in many ways. Makes you wish that he kissed her in the car under the stars and the African Ritual Dance is absolutely hilarious. Hope they re-release it soon.
5,80's Rule,"I received this in good condition. It is one of my favorite movies. If you are familar with the 80's, you will love this movie."
1,No widescreen = NO SALE,"I've been checking and checking and checking, hoping that the people at Disney would release a widescreen version of this great 80s film. However, it still has not materialized. The logic apparently is that ""family"" films should be released in fullscreen. However, Disney must surely realize that a large percentage of true film fans and collectors will refuse to purchase a pan and scan title. Because there has not been a new widescreen edition, I refuse to purchase this chopped release."
5,Wonderful Movie!!!,This movie really reminded me of my own life. I'm Amanda and I married my Ronald! Theres definitely something to be said about loving who God made you to be and not trying to fit in to be who/what you think others will acccept. Great movie with a powerful life lesson!
5,BLAST FROM THE PAST,"TIRED OF THE SAME OLD ""NEW"" MOVIES? TAKE A BLAST TO THE PAST OF YOUR MORE CAREFREE DAYS. CHEAPEST VACATION YOU WILL TAKE. YOUR CHILDREN WILL FIND THE CLOTHES AND HAIR HUMOROUS."
3,VERY GOOD TEEN HIGH SCHOOL COMEDY FULLSCREEN DVD BUMMER!,This is another good teen comedy from the 80'. It's a shame that the DVD release is fullscreen. This movie deserves a deluxe DVD treatment.
2,NO widescreen??? Unacceptable,This movie is easily 5 or MORE stars. But the DVD only gets two. Picture is fine but it is not in widescreen format! Totally unacceptable for a DVD to come out in 2002. Love the movie. One of my absolute favorites.
4,Great 80's teen comedy,"Viewed as a genre of its own, the 80's Teen Comedy produced some fun, enjoyable movies. One that holds up quite well is Can't Buy Me Love. Starring Patrick Dempsey in what was probably his best role of the era, it's the story of a geeky kid who pays the captain of the cheerleading team to pretend to be his girlfriend for a month. While not entirely realistic, it has a good ending. The humor holds up well after 16 years, as does the movie overall.The DVD was hugely disappointing, and my 4 stars are based on the movie itself. Unless you consider chapter stops a special feature, the disc is devoid of any extras. The greatest offense is that it's presented only in fullscreen. I'd normally pass on a non-widescreen release, but my wife insisted on having it. If you have to have this movie, this is probably the best release it will see for quite some time."
4,One of the many masterpieces produced in the 1980's.,"This movie has everything you expect from an 80's film. Amazing characters, great music, and unforgetable one liners. ""Tell him I'm washing my hair...out of the country.""This movie is pure entertainment, culminating in Ronnie's vindication ""Hi Ronnie"".A must see."
3,fullscreen? really?,"This is one of my favorite movies from the 80s. I'd probably buy three or four of these as gifts for friends if it was widescreen.With Patrick Dempsey's comeback in full swing, why no re-release of this 80s classic? (It wouldn't need a re-release if it was done right the first time.)"
5,A Lost 80's romantic comedy gem,"Teen movies/romantic comedies sometimes were better in the 80's compared to now but heck that just might be nostalgia talking. A young Patrick Dempsey is in his senior year of high school. He is also smitten with Amanda Peterson, the prettiest and most popular girl around. She is dating a college boy and is a cheerleader so catching her is a ticket into the in crowd. The cost of the ticket to high school royalty is $1000. When the object of his desire ruins her mother's suede jacket by a wine stain she will do anything to replace it before mom gets back. Dempsey's character offers to pay for a replacement but she has to agree to be his girlfriend. The tactics works until it is all found out. But he still gets the girl in the end. Dempsey's charm was evident even when he was teen star."
4,Cute 80's movie Get's a 3.5!,It's been a while since I've seen it but i do remeber that it's an very cute 80's movie. And it really made me happy that I knew what school they filmed it at YEH GO THS!
1,DVD was the wrong region code.,The dvd was the wrong region code. It wouldn't play in my dvd player.
3,horrible customer service,"I ordered this video Nov. 30th and was told that it would be delivered by Dec 22nd (which was long enough to wait). On Dec22nd I checked the status of my order again, and now it says it will be delivered after Dec 24th. Four weeks to wait for a video? This is ridiculous."
3,80's fun,"This is a typical 80's romantic comedy. It is very formulaic yet it still manages to be fun. I love looking back on these films because I grew up with these movies, clothes, songs, and culture.If you love the 80s then you should see this movie. It is better than several other options. However, it is not the best option. I think ""Say Anything"" is my favorite. I am partial to John Cusack.The acting, story, and overall feel of the movie is fine. One of the other reviewers mentioned that some actors went on to huge careers and it shows in some scenes. However, some show their inexperience.So if you love the 80s you should see this film; if not rent ""Say Anything"" because every one should see this movie once."
5,McDreamy when he wasn't so dreaming!,"I use to watch this movie when I was in Jr high. I loved it!! I actually got over culture shock the summer I lived in France when I was 16 because of this movie. It was the only movie the family I lived with owned that was in English!! I bought this as a gift for one of my friends who had never heard of the movie, but is a huge McDreamy fan!I still watch it when I can and love it!!"
5,My favorite movie!!!,"i ran into this movie on tbs when i was on vacation this august. i was too busy to watch the whole thing.. but what i did see, i totally liked! it was weird that i saw it on that day because it was the same day that it was released on dvd! i was so happy! if u like 80's movies.. u are in for a treat. after i saw this movie i got a big crush on patrick dempsey.... old or young.. he just looks great! u must see this movie! go buy or rent it now!"
1,"No widescreen, no sale","This is an excellent movie, and I would buy it in a second, were it not for the fact that it's only available in 'full-screen' (pan & scan) format. I want the whole picture! Until then, i'm not buying."
1,For the DVD,Why is this not on Widescreen? Why does Disney think everyone wants it on Fullscreen? I think someone should start a petition for a Widescreen version to this movie.
4,Makes his Unpublished Letters Available,"Michael Faraday ranks today as one of the greatest chemists and physicists of all time. In fact, it was more or less in the era that he lived that physics and chemistry separated as sciences. He may be considered as the last major figure to span both disciplines. He is reputed to have complained that the word ""physicist"" was so awkward to pronounce, unlike ""chemist"", which just rolls off the tongue.The attraction of this book to students and historians of science are the many unpublished letters. Now accessible to a much broader audience. You can get some insight into his mental workings. Plus, his correspondents include some towering figures in 19th century Britain. Isambard Brunel, Charles Babbage and others stride across this book in cameo appearances."
3,Cute alternative to Hollywood.,"This is a ""lite"", cute movie that will offend no-one (except, as I see below, someone's Slovak relatives: teehee!) Please pay no attention to that Czech reviewer who goes on about how ""subtle"" and deep the movie is and how no-one who hasn't lived through the experience [blah, blah, blah] will understand it: this is the standard claim of many a blowhard who thinks that only they have the patent on understanding their own history. After all, the Academy voted Kolya best foreign film, so how subtle could it have been? Just the opposite: with an eye to non-Czech audiences, the script is teeming with innocuous ""explanatory notes"" so that really everyone gets the drift eventually. The boy is cute, Mr. Sverak wry, the plot is quite funny, Prague is pretty, and the subtitles are pretty damn good. All in all, a cute, sentimental, but still very watchable and well acted feel-good movie."
4,Kolya,"We really liked Kolya. As with so many foreign films, it offers good acting and real life experience that is often not found in Hollywood movies. Except for some very brief skin, I would recommend this to anyone."
3,Hindsight bias,"This is indeed a charming and a touching story. Other reviewers have covered the plot quite well. I do believe that the characters in the movie are good and acting is quite good as well. Movies like this are uplifting and give person quite a good feeling and offer some hope. In real life people indeed do change, can set aside selfishness and are able to care for one another.What I did not care for so much in the movie were the scenes that were written for the Hollywood audience. The ""prophecy"" of sending communists to a reservation in Albania, or holing up in the apartment like the allied pilots shot down during WWII, the list goes on. These were not only Hollywoodized, but also presented some obvious hindsight bias that was all too obvious to me as I, like Sverak, grew up behind the Iron Curtain in Czechoslovakia.With that said, the movie is worth watching and I would recommend it."
1,Language is not Russian (as stated by amazon) but Chezh. Be aware!,If you don't understand Russian and going to follow subtitles - this one is for you. The DVD quality is perfect (I'm not gonna say anything about the movie - lots of reviews here). But the fact that amazon said it is Russian but it turned out to be Chezh made me sad..
3,"charming,nothing more","This is good,interesting and charming movie,but there is so much better movies made in Czech Republic,and in east Europe."
3,Not the best of Czech cinematography.,"Having lived in the Czech Republic for 18 years I can tell all the non-Czechs out there that Kolya is not the best of Czech cinematography. It is good, but really nothing spectacular; the fact that it won an Oscar and many better Czech movies did not only shows how little meaning the award has. Kolya is certainly a type of movie that you don't see come out of Hollywood. As I said it is good (I rate it 7/10), but fails to hold on repeated viewings. Certainly not something worth buying."
5,Kolya touched my heart,"The kid in the movie is absolutely adorable and the relationship that the man and the boy form is gorgeous. It was realistic at the end when the guy had to part with Kolya- no big happy reunion at the end, no Hollywood sappyness- just raw, real life. I loved this movie- the photography was striking showing Kolya stretch his hand out on the plane window over the clouds, showing the guy's toe sticking out of his sock. Everything was filmed at artistic angles. Delicous, a great movie to rent or buy. I personally want to own this movie- I will definately watch it again."
3,The product is not playable in my country on my player. I could see it with a trick on someone elses computer.,"The film is a jewel, 5 stars, I took 2 for the disappointment that I could not play it normally. Why do you sell a product that can not be viewed?"
2,Gangster movie with out the flair,"Coudn't think of one redemening factor about this film just plain killing, the story is set around a robbery that goes wrong. Interesting ending."
5,FIFTEEN YEARS AND STILL WORKING,"I've had it for 15 years and still cuts straight. I like their scoring system. It's a perfect cutter for straight cuts til 16"". A few years ago I had the need for a larger cutter, because nowadays everybody wants large tiles and diagonal setting, and I bought a TX-700, AWESOME! It cuts anything."
5,ONLY FOR THE PRO'S,"..WELL..WELL..WELL...WHAT CAN I SAY...TO SIMPLY PUT IT...THIS IS A PROFESSIONAL TOOL THAT EVEN THE NOVICE CAN USE WITHOUT ANY DIFFICULTY...I HAVE BEEN SETTING TILE FOR 7 YEARS NOW AND HAVE RAN ACROSS CHEAPER TILE CUTTERS(THE ""HOME DEPO"" TYPE) THAT ARE A LOT HEAVIER AND HARDER TO MANEUVER WHEN YOU ARE INSTALLING TILE...THIS TILE CUTTER IS TOP NOTCH AND IS WORTH EVERY PENNY THAT YOU PAY FOR IT AND WILL CUT YOUR INTSTALLATION TIME SIGNIFICANTLY...I CAN GO ON AND ON ABOUT IT...BUT IF YOU KNOW THE BRAND, THAN YOU PROBABLY ALREADY KNOW THAT YOU ARE GETTING THE BEST ONE OUT THERE......BUY IT!"
5,Planet Earth,"I originally saw this series back sometime in the 80's and found the series to be the most fascinating and riveting educational videos I have ever seen. Gives the viewer a better understanding of all the natural forces on, above and in the Earth that transpire every minute of every day. A must see for everyone!! Richard Kiley does an excellent job narrating and the pictures and graphics are wonderfully done! Bravo!"
5,"A great book for anyone looking to bring some American flavor to their sushi, SushiQuik style!","As the inventor and owner of theSushiquik Complete Sushi Kit, I want people to have fun rolling ingredients and knowing that sushi doesn't have to be just raw fish.This book gives some GREAT American Style sushi recipes that will fit anyone's taste!If someone in your household is turned off by the idea of raw fish, then what about a chicken roll? Or a steak roll?Give these recipes a try! And if your looking for an easy to use sushi kit, be sure to check out ourComplete Sushiquik Starter Sushi Kit with Rice CookerHappy Rolling!"
5,A sequel to Case For Mars,"After six years, finally a sequal to the best selling book 'The Case For Mars'. In this work Mr. Zubrin expands his previous arguments for manned mars exploration and cronicals some of the progress towards that goal. This is the story of prople doing what needs to be done to follow there dreams.Overall it is a quick read, only bogging down in the journal entries. The book also could use a timeline and listing of the crews in an appendix."
3,Fair cd from a talented band...,Good cd. Not really quite as original or well put together as the rest of the Chandeen cd's but still a good cd. If you are new to Chandeen don't start off with this cd...Buy some of there there more recent cds from there website and then move on to this one later.
3,Okay - but probably wouldn't recommend,"This was a little slow. Like other reviews said, it focused more on the women's stories than the actual labor/birth etc. I would recommend the Business of Being Born over this movie anyday. Better content, more engaging. However, this movie still had some good information and normalized home birth."
5,Starrett combination square,"I recentley ordered the Starrett comb. square that I needed in my furniture shop for a long time as my old square was not accurate to say the least. I find the new Starrett everything I had hoped for, right on the money for 90 and 45 degrees, well machined and marked, and smooth to adjust. My only regret is that I did not get one sooner."
2,Original length? Doubtful.,"I have a sinking feeling that Matecumbe's long-overdue arrival to DVD is not without flaw. The running length says 107 minutes but the theatrical version clocked in at 117 min. The original 1985 VHS ran at 107 min. but the 1997 VHS re-release restored the film to its original length. Because the title now falls under the ""Wonderful World of Disney"" banner, it looks like the disc is the shorter broadcast version, unfortunately. Very disappointing, for this is one Disney title I've been waiting years for to come to DVD. Oh well. I've still got my 117-min. VHS."
3,Maria del Mar Bonet sings Theodorakis,"I've long been a fan of the music of Theodorakis. I recently became aware of the amazing voice of Maria del Mar Bonet. I'm not sure if the production quality of this CD reflects the great talent of these two individuals. The liner notes tell us very little about the recording process for this album. However, another factor is that I have a cheap and simple sound system, so that may be part of the problem.I've only listened to this CD a few times so far. Perhaps with additional exposure, or listening to it on a better sound system, I'll get more out of it.At the time I purchased this CD, I also purchased an early CD by Maria del Mar Bonet, called ""Sempre."" The production quality seems to be better, and remarkable qualities of her voice come through better on that CD.My goal is to acquire additional recordings by Maria del Mar Bonet, to further explore the range of her vocal expression. I hope that her recordings become more readily available in the U.S."
4,May need to clarify the description...,"Greetings,I ordered two of these unit for use in my architectural woodworking plant. The units seem well constructed, and I think they will work nicely for me.However, someone may need to clarify the description of the case. The ""wooden"" case is a misnomer. One case was plastic with a woodgrain look, while the other was simply a plastic case. I would have prefered the wooden case, but c'est la vie."
3,Amazon/Chicago; value?,"This same caliper is available from Chicago Tools directly for around $60. (That's right; sixty---not one hundred-sixty---U.S. dollars.) Forewarned is forearmed.BTW, it's a perfeclty fine cheap digital caliper; once you've owned one you won't understand how to get along without one."
5,So far so good...,"I purchased this caliper mainly for measuring car rotors, some drum brake pads and miscellaneous stuff such as bolt and nut diameters. It feels very sturdy and the digital gauge part seems to be of decent construction."
4,Product as advertised...,"Decent product, quickly shipped. One thing to note- you will be belching up the smell of Garlic anyway."
1,Garbage,I find it funny that her ex-husband allegedly trashed her last year. I can't give her book much credence either since she was never seen in public with Diana and only wrote this AFTER Diana was dead. Why not before?
2,Can we believe this woman?,"""Lady"" Campbell seems to be promoting herself as a ""friend"" of the Princess of Wales. I find it very interesting that this is all coming out now after the Princess is no longer here to defend herself or to state whether this information is factual or not. There were many aspects of this book that were just a little hard to believe. This woman has made a living out of trashing the Princess and seems to have come into her own since her death."
3,BORING!,"I think that this book had far too much detail in it When you pick up a book that says ""Diana In Private"" you think it just might be juicy...in the beginning when she was talking about her family tree...i couldn't follow that at all...she would start off with Johnnie's family then, on to about her mothers faimly.......i just found it very hard to follow"
4,Diana's Life,"I really don't know why some people consider this woman to be a saint. I really think she was probably a caring, giving personbut lets face it , she was human. How many girls in their teensdream about marrying someone famous? Alot I'm sure. In her caseher wish came true and I don't think she was ready for it. Nobody is really at fault here. Lady Campbell is simply writingabout what what other people told her. Prince Charles was probably under pressure to marry and like alot of girls at 19she was probably INFATUATED not IN LOVE. It's very sad."
1,PURE JEALOUSY ON THE AUTHORS PART,"AUTHOR MAKES NO PRETENSE OF HOW JEALOUS SHE IS OF PRINCESS DIANA. IN ONE CHAPTER SHE SAYS ONE THING IN ANOTHER CHAPTER SHE SAYS THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE. I HAVE ALSO NOTICED THIS IN THE AUTHORS OTHER BOOKS. AUTHOR SHOULD LEARN TO ENJOY HER LIFE - AND STOP BEING BITTER, SHE IS NOT PRINCESS DIANA AND SHE NEVER WILL BE - SHE NOT EVEN IN THE SAME LEAGUE"
3,We still don't know Diana,"I bought this book in 1994 when it first came out. Have just re-read it and find that it is mostly gossip. The author's annoying way of identifying her sources puts me off. Few are named by their real names. It's like reading a tabloid.Diana comes across as a spoiled brat, but Charles leaves a lot to be desired also. At this point, do we really care? The Royal Family and their ""toadies"" in the UK seem so outdated. Their lives are very superficial and pointless according to this book."
4,"Dares to show the negative side of Diana, balancing positive","Only a book written well BEFORE Diana's death by a true British aristocratic insider would dare to show the negative side (along with the positive side) of Diana's character. Refreshing, particularly after all the smoozzzzy stuff that came out after her death. This book truly paints a multi-facted portrait of Diana. If you want perspective, read this book."
2,Science for the kindergarten,"Should have been a good idea. Quantum physics explained by the guy next door but Dr. Wolf goes overboard especially in the Marx Bros. attempts at talking in a phony German accent when explaining a theory by Plank, Schroedinger, Einstein et al."
1,ar real quantum DUD,"unfortantely, this set does not meet any of its stated goals.Fred is too cutesy in many places and it distracts from his lectures....I was SO happy when the series completed...I immediately mailed it back for a refund."
5,ROCK EN ESTADO PURO,"SI ALGUIEN BUSCA UN DISCO QUE SEA INPRESCINDIBLE EN SU DISCOTECA, AQUI TIENE UNO. ESTE ES PARA MI EL MEJOR ALBUM DE LA BANDA, POR DESGRACIA YA DISUELTA. CANCIONES COMO MARRON, ROSA I Y II, O TODAS LAS DEMAS HACEN DE LA DANZA DE ARAÑA UNA OBRA GENIAL."
2,Disappointing,"I love to read anything about Churchill and this book promised a treat, however it was a tremendous disappointment. About 2/3 of the book consists of alternating chapters on each man rather than on their relationship and what it meant for the outcome of the war. The book was superficial and didn't come even close to what the title promised."
3,Shabak--Good music,"This Cd is okay even for the fact that i dont have a clue what these dudes are saying. It reminds me of the beastie boys. My mom got it for me when she was in Israel on a trip with an organization. These guys basically scream in talent unlike Fred Durst's ""Faith."" This cd is quite rare in America. Ill listen to it every once in a while when I'm just ""chillaxing."" The only reason I gave it 3 stars is for the reason That I wish I could understand the rapping. If you like reggae, rap, D.J. music you will enjoy this."
4,Awsome CD,This CD is an awsome Israeli rap/rock CD. Even if you dont understand hebrew you still may enjoy this CD. It is deffinatly worth 12 bucks.
4,Informative,"This book does precisely what it promised to do, and not one thing more... it is a compact, readable, and informative account of the life and times of Grover Cleveland. I would enthusiastically recommend it to anyone whose knowledge about this underrated president is minimal but wishes to learn more; for those who already know a great deal about him, I would recommend those books that explore the details of his life, character, and administration (like the biographies by Allan Nevins or Rexford Tugwell). This book is a primer, nothing more and nothing less."
1,Hand Controller is a joke.,"I've owned this telescope for years, and for most of those years its been sitting in my closet collecting dust because it simply refuses to align. I've done everything to align this thing, and finally after years of this abuse, I've given up and called Tech Support which is another joke. They refuse to help me not simply because its out of warranty(no problem for me, I expected to have to pay), but because apparently they dont know exactly what the problem is."
3,PestContro II Digital Pest Repeller,"The PestControl II Digital Pest Repeller is easy to operate and is at effective controlling spiders, especially in our unfinished basement. The one in our kitchen also works effectively, but at times the noise it admits is audible. Perhaps it has do to with sound waves bouncing off the refrigerator and microwave surfaces or the interaction of the Repeller sound waves with those caused by the refrigerator when it is running."
1,Doesn't work,House is about 1300 square feet and I purchased 2 of these things. Been using them for two months seemed to help after a couple weeks but after a month of working mice have returned as bad as ever. Waste of $$$$.
1,Pest Repeller Failure,"This is the first and only product I have obtained from or through Amazon that is a BIG dissapointment! Yes, I took a risk, but this item is worthless. I tried contacting the seller, but get a run-around. Still trying to figure out who to talk to at the manufacturer. There is a restocking fee that costs more than the device! I had an ant infestation all-of-a-sudden. Hoped chemicals would be reduced or eliminated. Installing this device, the problem became worse than ever. Maybe I am safe from opposums inhabiting my home, but for insects, this product is worthless. It does NOTHING as suggested. The only plus is they originally shipped it very fast. I had hoped that in this day and age of technology, something of this nature would actually work. Apparently we have yet stuff to learn..."
5,Insect Control,"I have had this product for about one month and since installing it my wife and I have only seen one bug in the house. At this point, we are completely satisfied."
2,product review,"It is not working as it said.It can not protect mosquito,house fly and other small insects.I have to return the item."
4,Works Well,"We have purchsed 2 Lentek Digital Pest Control II and plugged them in our finished basement and our top floor where our bedrooms are. We have noticed some spiders in both areas, but, really not many. We will be purchasing another unit for our main level as I beleive it is important to have a unit on each level of our home to receive the best coverage. I would recommend this product. Be sure to follow the directions and make sure to insert the unit into a socket that is not covered by any furniture etc; the unit must be clear of any obstructions. In all, the unit does work well."
1,LenTek pest control,This product does not work. I have watched mice run under the unit plugged in. I have moved it to several locations and it still isn't working.
2,doesn't work for crickets,"I was told by my landlord that this particular Lentek pest control device was the greatest and that I should get two: one for inside the house and one for the garage. After researching online, I got ONE as it was fairly expensive, plus shipping costs. It does NOT work for crickets, which continue to plague me with what my granddaughter calls ""cricketing"" in the walls and ductwork of the house. Ugh! And yes, I did buy this IN ADDITION to professional monthly pest control inside and outside the house."
1,More mice than ever!,"I read the reviews before I bought this and took a risk. Now I have more mice than ever before. It's supposed to repel, not attract!!!"
1,Useless product,"Although the product had a QA tag, it was never really tested properly. I plugged it in to the outlet and nothing happened.I had to pay for shipping expenses and was not offered refund for that expense, time wasted etc."
5,No mice in sight. Knock on wood!,"I have not heard one mouse since installing this product. I have a 2400sq ft house which is 3 levels staggered like stairs built into a hill. I live in farm country so we have lots of mice running around all the time. I even get them in the car, which by the way I have been looking for this product for a vehicle. Anyways, I bought 2 of these & 6-8 of the small ones & put one in each room of my house. Yes it was a little pricey but no price is to high to pay to not hear the scratches in the middle of the night. One downfall is you shouldn't block it with anything, meaning furniture, toys, anything metal, also cloth absorbs the signals. GREAT PURCHASE!"
5,Winsome Wood Round End Table,What a great little table. Much more sturdy than I thought it would be. It looks great and the quality of the table is amazing for the price. I would highly recommend this little jewel.
4,great price,"Nice looking table, not too difficult to assemble. Bought this table and the Winsome end table together. There both suppose to be antique walnut but this table is definately darker than the other. However both are nice for the price."
1,Worst Amazon purchase ever--by far!,The first table I ordered was defective. Two of the four cams designed to attach the bottom shelf to the legs would not interlock. I ordered the replacement and had the same problem.
4,Harder to put together than I'd hoped...,"I really like my tables. I have 2 and use them as bedside tables. The directions weren't very clear (mostly illustrations without written directions) and the included tools weren't the best (I pulled out my own) so the first one took me an hour to put together. The second one went together easily. Once together, you'll like your table quite a bit."
5,Excellent Value,"The end table was easy to assemble and looks great in our basement family room. For the price, it meets our need perfectly."
2,Wood finish easy to stripped off,"At first glance when it arrived, it looked a well-down table.After few weeks, we placed a rubber eraser on it and left it there for days. Then I tried to remove the eraser away from the table surface and .... the wood finish on it was stripped off!! Can't believe this would happened."
1,BIG Increase In Price,How could the price of this item have gone up SO much since I purchased it a couple of weeks ago? I wanted to get another one but this is ridiculous.
2,"Nice looking, sturdy table - but, customer service is lacking timeliness !!!!!","This is a beautiful, sturdy table and just the right size for complimenting an antique love seat in the Master Bedroom. Assembly seemed to be easy, except the lower shelf cam lock screws are showing (1/4 inch) even after tightening the cam locks. Also had issues with inserting the drawer due to the screw not being long enough for the knob. Called Customer Service and all they said was to submit the Control No. on the form submitted with the box along with my issues. I will add that the shipment was very timely - only a few days after submission which was nice. Not sure if they will send 4 additional legs or different size cam lock screws, but I am having an open house less than 2 weeks and wanted this fixed by then. It seems once you purchase online, you are at their mercy for getting the product fixed."
2,It's says it's 20% Kona and 80% (MJB barf ground?),"That's what it tastes like, too. Just get the medium roast 100% Kona pods from them, it's fantastic. This is junk tho, IMHO. Don't know why they did it, there's Hawaiian non-Kona coffee that tastes good. What you wanted was the larger100% Kona variety pack versionof this from Aloha Coffee Co. which costs about $39 + S&H.; Still a bargain compared to Starpucky's at about $0.75/cup. Also look at the100% Kona Medium roast podswhich are totally delic. and comes in 1-cup and2-cup podsizes."
4,More Songs From The Canadian Songsmith,"Don Quixote is the follow-upo to Gordon Lightfoot's breakthrough album If You Could Read My Mind. Much like its predecessor, Don Quixote contains folksy songs with literate and vivid prose. The title track is a lush song with a strong vocal. Other songs like ""Ode To Big Blue"", ""Second Cup Of Coffee"", ""The Patriot's Dream"", ""Alberta Bound"" and ""On Susan's Floor"" contain vivid lyrics that have a real first person feel."
3,An Average Work,"As I've said on other reviews of Gordon's CD's, I bought several CD's at one time in anticipation of seeing him in concert, to familiarize myself with his work. My entire experience with him to date had been as a folk singer, and it's this work that still appeals to me the most from him. I found, however, that his music has taken a variety of directions, some I liked, some I did not. This CD probably fell in the middle of all of the ones I bought - it had good moments and not so good moments. But overall, I enjoyed it."
5,My Favorite Lightfoot Album,"I have been a fan of Gordon Lightfoot for many years. Back in the early 70's I read a review of Don Quixote in Stereo Review Magazine. I went out and bought this album. It was my first and started a music love relationship with this artist. It is nice that all of his albums are now on CD, the sound is great and clear. A true story teller. Wonderful just wonderful. Beautiful is my favorite song by Lightfoot."
1,Not impressed,"Product came from US I had to pay $70 delivery and when arrived I had to pay another 32 import tax and then could not open the box due to the cabin pressure on the flight over causing a vacuum. This sounds ridiculous but I tried many times but the only way to open it would have caused the box to rip and I did not want to give a present in a damaged box. I have now posted back to the US at further expense to myself, and am currently awaiting a refund. What a waste of time and money, lesson learnt!"
5,Armani Watch ARO237,"Great product, a few problems with the delivery as the Courior used was not aware that British Forces Post Office (BFPO) is an acceptable address and returned it to the USA. This resulted in the watch not arriving in time and as it was sent to an alternative address and not my TAX free BFPO number in the end I had to pay an extra 31 pounds. However, despite that, when it eventually arrived, it was just what I had expected and was a very desirable item."
5,"...a fun, page-turning read","....a fun, page-turning ""read"".......intriguing, likeable characters......interesting how the author was able to seamlessly weave history and science into this modern day novel....it definitely elevated the authenticity and appeal of the story....well done!"
5,An Extraordinary Find,"I accidentally came across this book, read the summary and the prologue and found it to be fascinating. I bought the book and what a great surprise. The book was an extremely enjoyable read that consumed most of my time for two days and part of the night. I couldn't put it down. I'm waiting for the next book by this new author. Fabulous."
5,Breathtaking!,"A breathtaking adventure in the most scenic places in the world by a fabulous cast of characters defines this exciting thriller. The genre at its best. Throw in a mystery villain, a magical amulet, a deadly pandemic and strong woman characters and you have a pretty good mix. Loved it."
5,Reign of the Rat,Excellent medical mystery. You learn about bacteriology and plagues as well as have a good adventure.
5,A blockbuster!,"If ever there was a book made for the movies, this is it! And it's timely too. Readers can see how governments and people react to a pandemic and how they should react. Besides being informative, it's downright fun. Great heroes and surprising villains in a fantastic, exotic world. Wow!"
5,A must read,The author has perfected the art of creating tension. The short chapters enhance the fast pace of this exciting novel about an extremely timely subject.I thoroughly enjoyed reading the book and recommend this thriller for the sheer joy of being in the world of the Reign of the Rat as well as being informed about a variety of scientific subjects. The author knows his stuff and makes it an exciting read.Can you give a book more than 5 stars?
2,Gold and silver pens,Ran out of ink after 10 Christmas cards! The ink was ok a little light and difficult to read so won't buy again!
3,does not glide easily over pencil,"I ordered these to jazz up my fashion illustration work. The colors were alright (gold is a bit dark), but only on blank paper. If I tried to put in metallic detail over areas where I put colored pencil, they did not work at all.I know they are not made specifically for this application, but just know they don't play well with others."
4,Very Good,"If you liked Cafe del Mar volumes 1 to 5, then you are going to like this record too. Plain and simple, this is classic Jose Padilla. If you liked him before, get this recording also."
4,It's not your basic 'eclectic' album...,"...I disagree with some reviewers that label this album as forgettable or predictable. .............. It's not AMAZING, but it does what it's supposed to do, take you to WHATEVER place you want to be IN YOUR MIND. Padilla is an expert craftsman. Never doubt his TRIPS %^)"
2,Alternative techno for beginners,"2 1/2Exotic but bland. Eclectic but predictable. This electronic album plays like a compilation and works best as background music since there are only about 2 whole tracks actually worth paying attention to. The remainder, while far from being a disaster, rarely expands past it's producer-intensive feel, either sounding arrangement-heavy or musically cliched."
2,Not wide width!,"I ordered these shoes for my daughter who has only one month of dance class remaining but had outgrown hers. I went with the Capezio ""economy"" version since there was just a month left of class but sadly, the Wide is no wider than the regular width. I had to rip the thick cushioned soles out of these shoes in order to fit them on her feet and they still are not wide enough."
1,Be Sure Before You Buy!,"I purchased a pair of tap shoes for my granddaughter. They were cute little shoes but she needed a larger size. Unfortunately, because she lives out of the country, they did not make it back to me in time for an exchange. I wanted just an exchange...not a refund. But the company claims there are no exceptions to its 30-day return rule, even for exchanges, so I am now stuck with these shoes. A reminder to always carefully read return policies before you make a purchase."
3,very narrow,I ordered a 9.5 Wide in this shoe. I was very disappointed at how narrow the shoe was. They were extremely uncomfortable for my daughter to wear.
4,Great Book,I liked this book and you often hear about Hitler's Fireman on the Eastern Front. Not much written on Model but easy to read book and I would recommend it.
3,small than I thought,"It is not a very big pan. If you cook a big dish, you'd better choose a bigger one. But the quality is ok."
2,10 inch aluminum skillet,I was disappointed with this fry pan. It is very lightweight and I doubt it will be able to withstand high heat although I have yet to use it to confirm one way or the other.
1,Yikes! Britstles of steel!,"I was looking for a brush with firm bristles but for me, this one is TOO firm: While it gives a very invigorating scrub, I find that the bristles are so stiff that I can't give myself a good scrub without peeling flesh. Also the handle isn't as long as I imagined it."
5,"Excellent, highly useful tool","Sometimes I balk at Starrett's prices, but I've never been disappointed. The 6 inch combination square is the most used measuring tool in my shop, other than my tape measure.Its very solidly constructed, with nice etched markings and a tight locking mechanism. Everything I was looking for in a combination square. After buying this, I was satisfied enough to buy the 12 in version."
3,"Good quality, but poor instructions for mounting","Constrution of this TV mount seems good and it is sturdy. The instructions for mounting are very poor (this coming from an engineer's viewpoint). Make sure you will be able to mount to a stud before purchasing this product. Once it was finally on the wall, we were pleased with the performance. It has many easy adjustments for different viewing angles. Also, it is sometimes difficult to tell from the verbage, but it is compatible with 200x100 VESA configuration."
2,This is Really Lame,"I picked this mystery up because I remembered the TV series starring Tom Bosley as Father Dowling and thought it was amusing. This is the first book I've ever read from this series and it will be my last. I can only assume that the script writers for the TV series were better writers than Ralph McInerny. The plot is mildly intriguing, but the characters are cardboard, the dialog is embarrassingly wooden, the humor forced, and the action scenes awkward. I gave it two stars rather than one because, as I said, the plot was reasonably interesting, if a bit clunky.Not recommended.Scott Morrison"
4,This is their best stuff!!,"It's one of the best French prog albums ever made...sometimes their style is different, closer to Mahavishnu Orchestra, but in the other circumstances their standard prog is ""aligned"" with the same impact, as within the albums by Ange and the other best Romantic Prog Bands!Well honestly I don't get crazy for their hystrionic vocals,neverthless I recognize their personal and very interesting approach inside their experimental music passages,reminding me sometimes of the fusion style by Arti& Mestieri!!For instance the track Cazotte no 1 is different, in comparison to the music ""clichè"" within the progressive rock scene at that time, but also the other tracks are excellent and complete this good work...well check it out at least!!"
2,Not so great,"I just returned from a 10 day trip to Rio and the surrounding areas and was profoundly disappointed by the guide book for the following reasons: 1) No useful maps (do you really want to carry around multiple guide books?); 2) Totally out of date (I tried virtually every club/bar listed and wasted much time on wild-goose chases); 3) No useful info on hotels (doubt the author stayed in any of them or even visited them); 4) Restaurants recommended were all disappointments (if they were still extant)and 5)Assumes reader knows Portugese and is familiar with how to get around.If you plan to visit (and you should because it's truly a wonderful country) invest a few weeks in Brazilian Portugese lessons. Surprisingly few people in and around Rio speak English (even in the service sector) and if you have a basic understanding of the language your trip will be a thousand times better. And if you want info on the local music scene, just pick up the local paper and it's all there."
3,OPEN THE FLOOD GATES,"This made for TV disaster flick has all the ingredients expected:1. Three former TV Stars (Joe Lando from DR. QUINN; Bruce Boxleitner from SCARECROW AND MRS. KING and Michelle Greene from LA LAW).2. A corporate baddy whose greed has led to inferior construction of the dam.3. A broken family with a father who hasn't kept in touch with his child.4. Stubborn lawmen who answer to money.5. Lots of oh my Goodness moments.6. A strongwilled architect who tries to warn everyone of the impending dangers.7. Average special effects.But, in spite of its lack of originality, the direction and acting are good, with Greene doing a nice job as the mother/substitute mayor, etc.A little above average for movies of this type."
1,They aren't closed captioned,I bought this only because it said it was closed captioned and we can't watch movies with words due to hearing problems which resulted in us wasting our money on the movie.
3,"Looks great on a shelf, but sleeves tear easily","With kids, our DVD collection spiked had doubled over the past five years and consumed our bookshelves. Purchased three albums. As promised in other reviews, they looked great on the shelf, however, the one that holds our children's DVDs hasn't held up well to the constant wear. Sleeves are plastic and tear easily if DVDs aren't inserted carefully, i.e., by an adult. Still, I prefer these albums over others I've seen."
4,Thought provoking,I had heard this book discussed on public radio. I found it just as interesting as it sounded. It made me think about my own losses of friendships over the years. I have since renewed one important one. Glad I took the time!
2,repetition = boring,The concept and first couple of chapters were very interesting. Beyond that there was little but numerous anecdotes illustrating the same points. I found myself just skimming the second half of the book.
3,Disappointing...,"This book was interesting and uplifting in its examination of a friendship that has weathered all the ups and downs that life can bring, including divorce, death, and feelings of competitiveness. However, I feel that Goodman and O'Brien chose to discuss friendships with women who were very similar to themselves, i.e. women who are college-educated and fairly economically well-off. The authors are unusual in that they have the financial resources to take vacations together,to fly to visit one another, and to make lengthy long distance phone calls. I felt that the authors' lacked sensitivity to the fact that many women are not so fortunate. A few of the women portrayed are exceptions, but by and large Goodman and O'Brien have examined friendship in the context of privileged lives. I would have liked to read a book that focused on very ordinary people who were blessed with extraordinary friendships."
3,Good product....But!,"I have been using this product for a long time and it does a nice job for me, keeping my hair in place and making my gray hair looking darker, which I like. However take care of were you rest your head as this will leave behind a gummy film that is not east to take off my leather chair as well as my hair brush."
4,Great for curly hair1,I am on a constant quest for products to help tame the friz of my very curly hair.The foaming pomade does a nice job of keeping the friz down without weighing down the curls.
5,Just simple pleasure!,"This is an amazing collection of songs from one of India's most talented singers. The songs in this album showcases the versatility of Shubha. Her earthy voice lends a soothing and touch to the beautiful lyrics. 'Ab Ke Sawan' is a fast paced song about the mosoon rains and its effect on everybody. 'Bairie Chain' speaks about the separation of lovers and the pain and impatience to reunite. 'Seekho Naa', a slow sensual song, is a request from a newly-wed wife to her husband, imploring him to learn the language of the eyes, asking him to read and understand the love and the need in her eyes. 'Is Pal' talks about life and living. 'Hai Payar To Musafir' talks about life as a journey and is talking to te traveller. Alltogether, an unforgettable album which has enduring music and extremely beautiful lyrics. A must have for anyone who loves Hindi songs."
2,Bad mastering,"What a dissapointment this FTD release was. The original album sounds horrible. Sounds like they took a copy of a copy of a copy of the master and then applied Noise Reduction to it to make it sound as dull and lifeless as humanly possible. This is the worst version of the original album ever released. Amazing! Shame on you Ernst! Listen to every FTD release before releasing it from now, will ya?The rest of the tracks, the alternates and outtakes sound OK. So, this is not definitive. You still need to find a decent copy of the origianl album. Save your money."
5,Great scope for the size,"My neighbor has a Meade ETX125 and he has spent countless hours modifying it and attempting to make it as easy to use as the Nexstar (he still is not there). After a fairly simple alignment process, the scope slews easily to find other objects. The computer program can find most objects an amateur like myself would be looking for. The computer program that comes with it provides additional info. The scope does require additional lens so be prepared to purchase extras as well as filters if you are going to be looking at the moon."
2,Repeating Himself,"I love Jim Oliver's HARMONIC RESONANCE cd so I decided to get this one. I wish I didn't waste my money. No reason to own both, they sound way too similiar! Harmonic Resonance is the better of the two."
4,The talking tape measure,"With its voice recording capability, it's great to ""take notes"" without writing. It doesn't record for very long, but it's usually enough for a series of measurements. The recording quality is pretty good. It's very handy. I'm surprised it's not sold in more places. It makes a terrific gift. Be careful not to get sand into it though, or the speaker will rattle.I've had mine for several years and it's still going strong. How often have you had to measure something and it's "" just a little more than 25 and 5/16""? With this, when you're standing at the saw and can't remember exactly, your own voice can verify so you can ""measure twice and cut once."""
3,Very important for anyone : professional or not,"This is another product that makes you think ""How did I manage to survive without it ?"". No more pieces of paper with mysterious notes, no more ""i guess it was..."". Though I think it should be able to record a larger number of entries this is a must have tool, whether you are a professional or not."
2,Flimsy blade,"I bought one of these tape measures a week ago and aside from a less than perfect sound quality,which I can live with,I was happy.That is until yesterday when I noticed the tape or blade was starting to wrinkle up and it could'nt even be shut unless I bent it back to shape.Now I have to go out and get a replacement blade for a brand new 30 dollar tape measure.Is that right?It seems to me like they tried to save a little money and compramised their product.The bottom line is for a tape measure that dosen't sound very good or work very long you would be better off to spend you hard earned money elsewere."
1,Good Idea-Poor execution,The blade for this tape measure is flimsy and did not hold up nearly as well as other tape measures costing less than $10. The quality of the voice playback is poor and hard to understand. I was much more impressed with the electronic stud finder manufactured by Zircon.
2,Very Cheap Blade,"I found this to be a useful product but the quality of theblade was much worse than a [cheap] tape measure that I just bought. The original blade was shot after one small project. To make matters worse, I found it almost impossible to change the blade, I had the blade out of the [cheap] tape in seconds and after 4 screws and 5 min. I couldn't get the blade off the Zircon without loosing the spring."
1,Good Gag Gift For Your Cut Man-But Nothing More,This tape lasted approx. 2-3 weeks before it was history. I got it for my cut man for X-mas as a joke (well- not really!) and it didnot last till February. The end of the tape broke quickly and on cold mornings the voice recorder did not work at all. Bad investment-my current Stanley 30' Max Steel is about 9 months old and still strong as ever.
2,can't be cleaned,"Yes, this fan is fairly quiet and it does do everything a fan should do. It is a little pricey, but I thought the reputation of ""quiet and effecient"" would be worth it. I simply cannot clean it. It came with my husband and has never been cleaned, it needs a good cleaning. There was so much crusty dust on there, I thought I would just have a go at it one morning and then I could literally rest in peace. I struggled. I have had other fans in my life, they all accumulate dust, but this one needs an entire tool boxto open up. Even with that, I never did get it apart.I therefore cannot recommend, ESPECIALLY in households with allergies."
4,"Compact and powerful, cya Holmes","This fan is great because it's doesn't take up a lot of space, is fairly quiet, can tilt in any direction, and is quite powerful.Haven't had to use it on high(3)yet as 1 and 2 feel windy enough. Although it's slightly loud on high like most fans. Compared to my older Holmes fan, this one dwarfs it in performance, power, compactness, and noise.It feels like a cool evening breeze when propped in front of a window. Haven't had any problems at all. This one is built to last.As far as price, Yes, it's almost as much as a cheap air conditioner, but you get what you pay for. A cheap brittle Holmes or a quality built Vornado."
3,"very bright, but wiring may be defective","This cosmetic mirror is super bright, just what I wanted. I've only used the 1x side because on the 9x side, not every area of the mirror is in focus. This would be an excellent lighted mirror except that the wiring may be defective. Sometimes after I flip on the on switch, the light doesn't turn on. Only after I jiggle the wire a little would the light now turn on. I'm just afraid one day the jiggling trick doesn't work."
4,Great,"I bought this a I have a nice desk top unit at home and it's too large to take on vacaton. This unit really does the trick. Compact, lightweight and has a soft light so you can see real well. I would buy another if I lost or broke the one I have."
3,Nice heavy mirror but way to intense magnification,One inch is too close to see clearly there is no room for hands to work on your face. Retuning for a x5 mirror. Square may be better than round. Need to re-read reviews again. THIS IS EXHAUSTING!
2,Doesn't Work in Europe,"I bought this mirror in February of 2012 and was pleased that it has a very bright light and good magnification without distortion. I recently took it to Spain and when I plugged it in with a European adapter, it was okay for about 30 seconds and then I heard a loud pop and it went off and wouldn't work again. I called Floxite and the customer service rep said, ""I hear that all the time."" I asked her if it could be fixed and she said, ""No."" I said, ""It is a travel mirror and nowhere in your product description online or in Amazon's product description does it say it can't be used in Europe."" She had no answer for that. It's a shame that Floxite doesn't stand behind their products. I've only had this mirror for 10 months and I paid $59 for it and now I have to buy a new one. It worked fine for me here in the US but if you're travelling to Europe or any other foreign country, take a pass on this one."
1,not worth it,"I read other reviews that noted that the wires were shorted out from opening and closing it, but thought they had modified it. Well, I used it on two vacations and before the last one was over it stopped working. Too late to return it so I took the wires out and use it as an ""unlit"" mirror. Not really a good value. Next time I will pay more attention to prior reviews."
4,Great light!,"It seems a little on the heavy side and bulky for a travel mirror but, you will see EVERYTHING on your face. No glasses required. Get the tweezers and concealer ready!"
1,Home Travel Mirror,"Very disappointed with this Home Travel 9X/1X Folding Lighted Cosmetic Mirror. Mirror too small, unable to see full face to put on make-up and lighting not good."
4,"Good light, quality mirror","Pros- excellent lighting9x and regular -both without distortionslittle tray for small items like tweezersplugs in, no battery replacement worriesConI am not able to get the regular view mirror to be the primary mirror. Its always the 9x mirror that will be the closest to you. They do flip, but its with a rotating arm, and no way to change it. I am thinking of unscrewing it and reversing it myself.That being said, its only a minor issue, and if I wasnt so OCD, might not bother me."
1,I was very disappointed.,"I had wanted a battery operated lighted cosmetic mirror, not electric. There is another company that hasa battery operated one."
2,Mirror has a wave in it,if I move the wave in the mirror will make me dizzy. I like the mirror but the wave in the glass is driving me crazy
1,disappointed,i was very disappointed with this purchase. it is too heavy and bulky and is too big for travel mirror. will return and purchase another product.
2,"Not a ""travel"" mirror really","This item is really too big and heavy to be described as a ""travel mirror"". Nicely packaged but too big for a carryon flight bag or to take away on a weekend. I was very disappointed. Fine as a ""Home Cosmetic Mirror""."
4,"Fabulous ""on the road"" vanity",Well it's great! Better than the Zadro travel mirror (which is delightfully smaller and more compact but doesn't stay up very well)This mirror packs up nicely. Wish it was a little smaller but I like the dimensions of the mirror to be larger anyway - in which to examine my entire face. I don't need the magnification to be 9x. 3-6x will do but it is the only two sided mirror with 1x on one side and increased magnification on the other that I found for travel and actually like. The lighting is the bomb diggity!I searched high and low for my make up mirrors for home and travel. The Zadro S neck surround light for home and this baby for travel has -thankfully- put an end to my search.
1,Loved it at first but broke after 4 months!!,I bought this for a make up mirror in my dorm. It works perfectly because when I want to use it I can just pull it out and use it then pack it right back up with no problem....but after 4 months of having it I thought the light bulb burnt out. So I bought a brand new light bulb for around $15 still didn't work. My dad is pretty handy at fixing things he took it apart and found out that the ballast (which supplies the power to the whole thing) completely burn out..wont work!! We have been trying to find a new ballast to replace it with but this company makes it a certain size and doesn't sell replacements. I mean its not an easy thing to replace in the first place but since I paid about $50 for a mirror that lasted 4 months we thought we could fix it. I WOULD STRONGLY RECOMMEND NOT GETTING THIS MIRROR!!
1,Junk,"I had the same experience with this item and the seller as the earlier reviewer, L. Pilong. I purchased the mirror for my wife. When she switched it on the first time, it illuminated briefly, then went out. I obtained a replacement bulb from the manufacturer, presuming that to be the defective part, but the mirror would still not illuminate when plugged in and switched on.The seller, DBRoth, refused to help.As L. Pilong said, avoid this item, and this seller."
1,piece of junk,"I loved this mirror....for 2 1/2 months, and then it broke. It wont light. DBroth wont give me my money back or replace it. Don't bother with this mirror....or the seller."
5,GREAT lighted magnification mirror!,"I purchased one of these mirrors for a trip (you never know what the hotel accomodations are going to be like until you get there!). I wanted to be sure that I had a good mirror for make up, contact lens insertion, etc. I have purchased so many in the past that I was truly a little skeptical about this one. Once I got it and used it, I was truly IMPRESSED! It is a nice size, the light is very bright, the mirror swivels from a normal view to magnification (9x), it folds to a nice compact travel size.... It has truly exceeded my expectations! I even bought TWO MORE because I don't want to be without it! It has replaced my big bulky home vanity mirror, too!"
5,love this mirror,This is one of the best makeup mirrors on the market I love it and can travel with it it's greah highly recommend!
1,It doesn't work!,"I read all the reviews about this mirror not working but I bought it anyway. Should have listened, the light doesn't work. Other that that it is a nice mirror!"
2,Too heavy for travel.,I bought the mirror for travel but it's too large and heavy for this purpose. I like that it's battery operated and has magnification but would not buy again.
3,Did not fit my needs,"It was too high powered magnification for me. Hard for me to use. Otherwise, there was nothing wrong with the mirror."
1,Dont buy - Big dissapointment,"The whole lesson is hust slow and boring. Watching someone tell you note by note is insain. here's a hint TAB!!! Teacher needs to explain technique such as right and left hand techniques, and not so much time with basic theory. This DVD was a HUGE DISSAPOINTMENT that did nothing to enhance my playing skills. I suggest DON'T BUY IT!!!"
3,Buy a reference book with dvd.,"This dvd is actually really good. He starts out showing you all the forms you need for the licks he plays later. Problem is remembering them. That is remembering the specific notes in each one, fingering, and name. Get an arpeggio book with this to use as a reference. Also, the video starts off slow, but then he takes off on you. It's almost as if he wants you to be Van Halen after learning a few arpeggio forms."
1,fake copy,Dvd was no good. did not play or work on any system i tried. The disc was blank. I received a prompt refund from the company. They were very helpful and courteous. Still looking for this title.g
3,Decent video,The video came after a week or so. The video itself was just like the others in this series. Very easy to follow along with the instructor and good camera angles to see both the picking and fretting hands.
3,WEAKEST POSSIBLE ENTRIES!,"Yes, the Sci-fi Clu boys from Indianapolis chumped me too. Thes two initial pilots, and first episode are the lamest entries in the Lost in Space arena. Avoid confusion! Avoid this messy collective yourself!"
1,Woeful,"This product is terrible.In lesson 1 for beginners the phrase ""parlez vous Francais"" is translated as ""are you a student?"" How can such a basic mistake go un noticed? Other examples are to be found-and the grating translation of 'tu' is given as 'y'all' so obvioulsy this CD ROM is intended for southern americans"
3,there it is,"I enjoyed the discussion of intertextuality and parody in this book but remain entirely underwhelmed by the taxonomy of differentiation for the diversity of allusion and intertextuality that exists among the authors that Genette chooses to discuss. The most interesting part of this text for me was the fine table that equivocates the chapters in Joyce's Ulysses with the books of the Odyssey. The author is profoundly smart and so able at comparing texts that I did enjoy reading this book. I found certain parts easily skipped (due to my lack of interest or background). I recommend this book for those specifically interested in the details of the matter at hand or in the critical writings of Genette. Beyond the pleasure of reading certain parts I do not find as much to recommend to the general reader. Better and clearer discussion exist of narratology and intertextuality. Still, Genette's book is not without educative charm."
4,Compeling Olio,"As usual the story is multi-faceted. It combines the lesson of ""you can't go home, again"" with a ""wacky old lady"". a dirty cop, drug dealers, a rising political boss, and a Serbian war criminal. Nothing is as it seems. I had not known about the removal of the bodies from the cemetaries. A little creepy. Good story, well told."
2,"Nice setting, weak plot","I read this novel because I have a professional interest in Venice. After David Hewson's truly dreadful 'Lucifer's Shadow', also set in the city, this was a relatively pallatable novel. But it has some serious failings. Firstly Zen doesn't really exhibit the attitudes and sensibilities of an Italian police officer, but rather that of a well-educated middle class Englishman - i.e. what the author is. This becomes more and more obvious as the story goes on. The second big problem is the way the plot simply fizzles out. There are few, if any, real surprises or revelations, which is rather a let down. Also, like other British authors before him, Dibdin cannot resist reminding us at every turn how mysterious Venice is: the fogs, the creepy narrow streets, the smelly canals and crumbling palazzos, etc etc etc. The trouble is, it's all too familiar. We've all seen it, or at least seen the movies set there."
1,Dead Loss,"Dire, cliche-ridden crime 'thriller'. Silly, contrived plot. Venice feels about 10 blocks wide with characters bumping into each other. Dead Lagoon almost works as a parody with its mad spinster, bent cops, dodgy politicians, nazi past, beautiful love foil and terrible prose style weighed by comically bad metaphor and simile.In the three Dibdin novels I've read there is always a climatic chase scene at the end. Unfortunately the 'big chase' here is just tendious and the outcome contrived.There are some passages which made me giggle as they were so badly written. Zen's reaction to a night of passion for instance. Or when a character blows a puff of smoke (there is a lot of gung ho smoking in this novel by the way) and makes a non-smoking sign gently spin.This mess doesn't so much as come to an end but collapse in a heap with a particularly risible final paragraph.Try Dibdin's Last Sherlock Holmes Story instead. It is infinitely superior."
4,DEAD LAGOON,"My introduction to Michael Dibdin and Aurelio Zen was a welcome one. I'm always in search for detectives with the intelligence and depth of personality evident in Colin Dexter's Chief Inspector Morse. Zen was not a disappointment and I'm waiting anxiously for several other Dibdin titles that I've recently ordered or won at auction. DEAD LAGOON, if you've been to Venice, is a wonderful flashback to the mood of that city with its many twists and turns of canals, streets and dark alleys. The only comparable for capturing Venice that I've read (or seen in a movie version) is Daphne Du Maurier's DON'T LOOK NOW. A great read - not to be missed!"
5,Another great Zen mystery.,One of the best in the Aurelio Zen series along with Cabal. Dibdin is supreme in this series when using Italian bureaucracy to bring the characters down to earth. In this novel he evokes a Venetian setting for the mystery comparable with Conan Doyle's London for atmosphere.Zen is a wonderfully fallible protaganist. On top of it all sits an intricate thriller. All the books in the series are great it's a shame they're not more popular in the States.
4,6.0 Scanner used for hurricane resistance inspections,"Our company has used the Zircon 55586 Metalliscanner 6.0 Deep Scanning Metal Locator for 4 years when conducting hurricane resistance inspections for single family homes. The Scanner is used to detect the presence of re-bar in exterior walls and to detect roof sheathing fasteners (nails) into the roof framing. We check spacing and determine if there are actually fasteners present. The Scanner has worked very well and we like the audible sound that is emitted when a nail is found, it makes the job easier when working in confined spaces associated with many attics."
5,one of the best bocephus albums ever,"now this is one of the best bocephus albums ever, yes the sound of country in the 70's was a raw sound and i like that sound alot, hank jr can still make good albums and still does, this is the sound of hanks i love best, daddy i need you tonight is still my favorite hank jr song, those type of songs, well the songs hank jr does about hank sr are by far my favorites by him... a fan of bocephus always, and the williams family..."
4,interesting,"this is a book about not so common visited places, although tere are also some very ""touristic"" places. the pictures are nice to good, it gives a good overview about Kyoto. I was a little disapointed that the Nanzenji temple is not commented. but if you are fond of Japanese gardens it is a good picture book that give you ideas."
5,I could read this book again and again!,"I had never heard of christian author Vanessa Williams until I stumbled across her Rain and Storm series while browsing for another book to make my $25 quota and get my ""super saver shipping."" I have to say my Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ lead me to this book and what a blessing it was! I've read several books written by gifted christian authors but never have I felt such a strong urge to re-read them, and at the same time, want to share them with my fellow sisters and brothers so they could share in the blessing.Vanessa, you are truly blessed and the Lord is pleased with the fruits of your labor. To God be the glory!"
5,Former Rain,This book is enlightning because it challenged me in my walk with the Lord. It taught me how to walk in love and forgiveness. If you read the Rain series you will truly be blessed.
5,AWESOME BOOK!!! LOVED IT!! COULDN'T WAIT TO READ THE NEXT BOOK IN THIS SERIES!!!,I rate this book 5 stars!!! Could not have asked for a better read. LOVE Vanessa Miller!!! Wouldn't change anything in this book!!!
5,Great book,"Great book, leaves you ready to read the next. What I love about this series is that the stories are modern day messages with biblical lessons that can be applied in your own life no matter how the rain falls on your journey."
4,Good gift for parents,"I just bought several bottle of this golden alaska deep sea fish oil for my parents in china. After having taken those capsules for 1~2 months, they have a good sleep and appetite that did not happen in their old ages."
3,Do your research first before buying,"Just wanted to let all the people out there know they should do there research on these fish oil, many of these product has mercury content in them, there are fish oil that has mecury filtered out, I dont know about this one though, so becarful, mercury is bad stuff."
2,Production description may be incomplete or wrong,Golden Alaska Deep Sea Omega-3-6-9 Fish Oil 1000mg 300 CapsulesGolden Alaska Deep Sea Omega-3-6-9 Fish Oil 1000mg 300 CapsulesProduct name contains Omega-3-6-9. In product description seller has mentioned details of Omega-3 fatty acids only. Product description does not have any details of Omega-6 and Omega-9 fatty acids. I have contacted this seller by phone and by email and requested detailed product description. But I did not get any reply. I kept wondering how Omega-3-6-9 capsules can be so cheap. If I really care for Omega-6 and 9 fatty acids then I would not buy this product unless I see complete description. I do not understand how can amazon allow such practice of selling medicine with incomplete product description. For Omega-3 capsules price I am rating this product as 2 star.
1,"DECEPTIVE Labeling: ""3-6-9"" but Contains No Omega 6 or 9!","This product only contains Omega 3 Fish Oil and absolutely no Omega 6 or Omega 9.Sources of Omega-6 Essential Fatty Acids include:Safflower oil, Corn oil, Sesame oil, Hemp oil, Pumpkin oil, Soybean oil, Walnut oil, Wheatgerm oil, and Evening Primrose oil.Sources of Omega 9 Essential Fatty Acids (aka Oleic acid) include: Canola oil, Sunflower Oil, and Almonds. There are products available that have all three oils, and thy're labeled as such. Unfortunately, this is not one of them.If you ONLY want Omega 3 Fish Oil, this product is the best value. However, to actually name the product ""...369"" seems almost fraudulent."
2,DIFFERENT NUMBER OF SOFTGEL,"Hi,I ordered 2 packs of this product and the description said it contained 300 softgel.When i opened the packaging I saw that on the original label, in friont of the bottle, there was written that inside there was 200 softgel and on the other side there was another label, different not original, where there was written 300 softgel. (i took pictures both labels). Than i decided to open it and counted them and there was only 200. so i bought to bottle of this item thinking that will arrived 600 softgels and now i have only 400 softgels. It is like i miss one bottle? But if we looked the description it would be said that i paid for 600 and i have only 400. I think that you have to send me another bottle . What do you think? And i think you have tyo change the description so nobody go to do a mistake!!!Thank you. Ivana"
2,"Ehh, it's okay ~BURP!","Ehh, it's okay if you wanna burp fish taste all day. Didn't really help with I wanted it for but you may have better luck."
2,Not as good as the last time I bought it,The first time I bought this product I thought it was excellent.This time it leaves a fishy after taste. I won't buy it again.
1,fish oil 369,"this is not one of my favorite oil's, after using this product i dont feel as good as when i use my 369 from other companys, plus i would burp this one more than others."
5,Love this product,"This product has given me thicker hair and shiner. Skin is not dry anymore, is truly a good product to keep using years down the road."
1,No expiry Date,I am not impressed with the product. Disappointing! There is NO omega 6 and 9 Just Omega 3. Disappointed. Not what I anticipated. A true and fair view of the Fact!! Not reflected.
1,Dissatisfied customer,I am very dissatisfied with the service. I received the incorrect product (poorly packaged by the way) and immediately returned it requesting that the correct product be shipped or a refund processed. A month later I have neither. Buyer beware
1,More typical Websterian Misinformation,"I don't know if Webster is deliberately trying to misrepresent the sources he quotes or if he just doesn't know how to do extensive research. He makes selective quotations from almost all sources in order to construct the picture of the Catholic Church he wants the reader to see. He is bound and determined to show that the Early Church was not the Catholic Church, which can never happen, since it was the Catholic Church. Anyone who does further research into the church fathers and other sources Webster quotes will see how misinformed he is."
1,"Good sound, bad materials","I had this headset for a little over 3 months. I loved the sound quality, the surround sound reproduction was great, and it had great bass and highs. They were comfortable and the microphone was great. After the 3 months however, the plastic that holds the speaker to the headband broke leaving them unwearable and not repairable by tape either. I looked and the other side was showing cracks as well. Good sound, bad materials. I took care of them, never dropped them, was never rough with them."
3,Good sound but not very durable,"I've had these for a little over a year now. I've taken good care of them, however recently the plastic that keeps the right speaker connected cracked and broke. I've had it held to getter with tape for a while but now the other side is breaking. Also there's a rattling noise within the right speaker, that's caused by the vibration.It was perfect when I bought it, and, besides the rattling, the sound quality is still good. However I spent about $80 on these headphones so I expected them to last me for quite a lot longer than a year."
1,Absolute Junk!,"Avoid these at all costs. First of all, the ear padding comes off very easily and it's a pain to put it back on (This happens quite frequently, even while gently removing them from your head). Second of all, the headband broke on one side and now the headphones will slide down my head, even after attempting to tape it. Last but not least, after a couple months the Center speakers stopped working on the headphones, leaving me with poorer sound quality.Avoid these headphones. I'm looking around now for replacements (these were a gift from a relative)."
1,fairly good until they broke,"I got these headphones at a local Fry's and enjoyed them for 2 and 1/2 months. I took good care of them, but they broke anyway, in the same place everyone else is having problems with--the rotating joint. Now they won't stay on the ear and are useless. I expected better from a pair of $60 headphones."
1,Bad quality,"Do not buy this item!!Mine broke before a full day use. Still, Amazon solved the problem in a quick and proper fashion."
5,Best Bang for the Buck,This is a great head set. I got minor distortion from that I tracked down to the power source. It uses a USB port for power but that was causing noise.(interference from my PC) I bought a USB wall outlet adapter from the dollar store for $1 & that cleared it up. I found one on Amazon for you ---->AC to Dual Port USB Wall Charger
2,"Good sound, terrible build quality","I've had these headphones for about a year and use them frequently for gaming. The sound quality is excellent and the different channels all have independently-adjustable volume. They do lack a mute switch for the microphone which is a big oversight. Also the headphones exert a lot of inward pressure on your head which makes it hurt to wear them for longer than a couple of hours.The real problem though is the build quality: after about 3 or 4 months the foam ear covering on the right side became completely detached and there's no easy way to reattach it. Fortunately because of that inward pressure it did stay in place. After about 10 months the plastic above one of the headphones cracked, exposing a very small and fragile-looking wire that will probably fail in a few more months. It's a shame because they sound nice and the mic works well, just very shoddy construction."
5,BEST VALUE in QUALITY Headphones,"These Turtle Beach Headphones are the best value I have found in high quality gaming headphones. When a ""GREMLIN"" broke my original set I jumped online and ordered another set since none of the ELECTRONICS BOX STORES in my area carried them. Had them in hand rapidly thank goodness. I was getting self concious about the duct tape and cable tie repairs I had made to my old pair even though they continued to work just fine. Now I have a back-up pair/loaner set to help others see the advantages to this outstanding set of phones/mic."
2,"I agree great sound, and comfort! Till they break.",I bought these headphones Sept 07. Used them often but carefully. Plastic ear piece broke of March 08. Nuff said.
3,Good--Not Great,"This story was well-written, but a little slow moving. I think it was the heavy description. If you like stories heavier on narrative than dialogue, you might like this book better than I did."
5,A refreshing love story,"Over 15 years ago I was addicted to romance novels, this is my first since then. I really enjoyed this book, I couldn't put it down and I was drawn in immediately. Luke was definetly not the average hero and I enjoyed that. A lot of unusual family twists and turns. This is a very refreshing romance story, very believable. I could've used a little less of the sex indepth details and a little more put into the story details but it is a romance novel and I still loved it. If you're into romance fiction I highly recomend this one!"
5,Realistic,I must admit I loved this book. Luke and Dahlia are about as real as you can get. Their relationship was sizzling as life continuously stepped between them. I enjoyed reading how they managed their lives and of course their steamy encounters certainly left me blushing.
4,Cowboy lobr,I enjoyed the book and could relate to the characters as person. They seemed real and were struggling with their fate in life and it all worked out.
3,not like the Idaho cowboys I know,"If you like it steamy you will love this. Was glad there was a happy ending. Idaho is beautiful, haven't spent much time in Texas, but I've heard Idaho is a better choice."
1,Uninteresting,Less than half star for originality. Nobody but Texas bible toting Republicans in a dream talk or live like this.
2,I'm stopping around...,"p70. This book just did not pull me in. The plot was not interesting enough. Recovering widow meets hot divorced grumpy man - yeah that is OK but I am already on p70 and nothing is happening of interest. They get drunk, go to the grocery store, try to buy shades, get oil in their furnace, get a table, yeah yeah yeah - whatever I am bored. So much for a contemporary novel - I liked Jennifer Blake's Louisiana Dawn and Jen Hollings Shadow Warrior historical fiction so much more!"
2,does author hate over weight people,"I have only made it to chapter 6 so far and I will finish the book but I really felt a need to point out some parts that really bother me. The author seems to have a problem with over weight people. example the part where she is talking about the range office receptionist as obese, wearing a mammoth sweater, waddling down the hall in shoes the size of shoe boxes and then in the bar the bartender is ""size of a tank"" does the author need to be so rude? it is as if she puts over weight people in the book just to write rude things about them. it may seem to most that I am being over sensitive but the main character is upset because of how she is treated being with mixed heritage the author is kind of sending me a mixed message and I just wanted to point it out since it left a nasty taste after reading it."
3,Predictable,A bit too predictable and not my usual choice of content. Guess I am more into history and or historical novels.
3,Good,I gave it 3 stars because at times the author kept repeating the same issues from the page before. It be nice to read about the daughter s
5,awesome story,This was one of the best books I have read this year considering I Have read over 600+ books this last year alone. The characters were so good I laughed and cried right along with them. Do not start this book at bedtime if you plan on getting any sleep it wont happen. I can't wait to see if this author has more books out there if she does you Can bet I'll be getting them.
1,Cowboy Sex,This book had very little plot and lots of descriptive sex. I was so disappointed and repulsed that I quit reading. I never met a cowboy in Idaho that was like this sex crazed jerk.
4,vicki's book,I haven't read the book as of yet. It looks like an interesting read though. I am pretty sure I will like the book.
4,A good read from start to finish.,"Characters were believable, bigger than life and colorful. Romance was steamy but not crude. Interesting from cover to cover. Could not put it down. Can't wait to read her next book."
1,This is a Truck tire gauge,"I ordered this because I knew my husband needed a new tire gauge. ok, I admit I am clueless about lbs or whatever but I don't think this mistake is completely my fault. When I received the tire gauge I realized this is a Truck Tire gauge. It is clearly labeled on the package as a ""Truck tire gauge"" but not on Amazon! Don't make the same mistake as I did!"
4,I like Ike.,"Wicker shows the complexities of our 34th President. Eisenhower was a great wartime commander. He led men into battle and exercised diplomacy in his wartime alliance. He was a so-so president who did some memorable things. Ike started the intrastate highway system, warned against the military-industrial complex, toppled two legitimate governments (Iran, Guatemala) and came close to a nuclear test ban treaty. He was a man many Americans treated as a father figure. He won two terms as President. Many people would have voted him a third term if the law allowed it. He was against the Brown vs. Board of Education decision but used the military to back up the judiciary.Wicker spent a week with Eisenhower in 1962. Even though his admiration of President and General Eisenhower in there, his book is a fair accessment of this great American. Eisenhower may not have been a great President, but he was far better than most of our chief executives."
2,Very thin and poor entry in this otherwise decent series,"I have read several of the books in the American President series and have discovered that generally speaking, the lesser known President's seem to get the best coverage but with this book Tom Wicker seems to be just lazing his way through Dwight Eisenhower's life. It is obvious that he doesn't have a great opinion of his and one finds that he can't list a single accomplishment of the Eisenhower administration that he reacts to positively.Sadly, this is a by the numbers biography and it pales compared to Stephen Ambrose's work and the work of a number of other fine authors. I do enjoy this series but suggest you avoid this work as it is really fluff and not worth the wasted time."
3,Workmanlike,"Some might argue that the job Tom Wicker has done here is a perfect fit for the Eisenhower presidency - workmanlike, efficient, strong enough to keep your interest but not compelling enough to make the reader feel like an expert on the President or develop a strong viewpoint about him. ... I would have liked a little more. (Something, for instance, on the Interstate Highway system would have been helpful. Or his views/feelings on postwar culture.)"
5,Yes...I Can feel It!!!,"I was counting down the days for this CD and boy has it has paid off!! You could not get any more perfectly produced pop music onto disc...this is a combination of all of the sounds that Rob and Apples have experimented with over the years and even a little help from the big names of the Elephant 6 clan. This CD actually sounds like a weird love child of Rob's last 2 projects - the recent Marbles release with its 80's new wave / ELO influence and his Ulysses garage / Pavement stylelings (with a great deal more production). Please buy this - no lover of pop music will be dissapointed. Not one bad track here...love them all - however highlights are Can You Feel It?, Energy, Same Old Drag, Sun is Out and Beautiful Machine Pts 1 - 4. Love your work Rob and co..."
4,Perfect for background music,"More catchy tunes from that band everyone can agree on! There's some interesting interludes on here, and a few wonderful pop tunes, but overall it's none too special."
3,A little disappointing,"I love the apples but this album was just OK. There are a few great songs that ROCK, but the rest of the album is a little lacking. In this age of being able to just pay for the songs you want, I'm wishing that I had not paid for the whole album. I think the cover art is really cool, and thats one good thing for buying the CD. If you really like the apples you will like this album, just remember its not one of there better creations."
2,2.5 stars to be precise,"The short instrumentals are the best songs on this album, why they didn't turn those into full length songs I'll never know, but they didn't.Overindulgent and I just didn't get it."
3,Something new,I was excited to hear something a bit modern and unpredictable. Yet I did not totally vibe on the entire cd. The songs that I do like are awesome! I am happy I bought it.
1,Don't Believe the Hype,"Many reviews compare this CD to Beach Boys, ELO, XTC, Polyphonic Spree, Phil Spector Splendor...dont' believe the hype. I'm open minded beyond belief. Let's put it this way... I'm an album purchaser. I don't download one song from a cd...i have to have the entire album. The best thing about this CD is the cover. The CD often has good songs or instrumentals that last a minute in a half?! Apples in Stereo will always get good critic reviews but go try Of Montreal or ELO remasters instead. This cd is generic sounding and I really wanted to like it. Just check out the cool song titles and the awesome cover then, go listen to something else."
4,A good beginner telescope.,"At least I'm a beginner and I'm enjoying it. Very easy to set up and to get aligned. Finds things pretty well with the hand control. Mars looks good, shows some surface detail and the ice cap. The moon looks truely awesome.I haven't seen any of the deep sky stuff yet, but I haven't yet taken it out into the country for real darkness.It is a beginner unt though and I already know I'll have to spend much more money on a better one in the next year or so.One suggestion, I found the two star alignment easier to use and more accurate than the auto alignment. Maybe I was doing something wrong, I dunno."
3,Easy to assemble but not so easy to use,"...The package arrived yesterday and I have no problem putting the stuff together, but I had a hard time finding the star. I tried the auto-align feature, but didn't help much. When it slews to Vegas or Polaris, I only see couple of very faint stars in view. I then manually align it to Mars, doesn't matter which of the 3 lenses I used or the adjustments I made, when in focus, Mars was no bigger than what I see with my naked eyes. When I enlarge it, all I see is a big blur circle.Also, the telescope will wiggle as you use it. When I finally have something aligned in view, scope will wiggle as I turned the focus knob which normally made it out of the alignment. Also, to align the object centered in the Star Finder was impossible for me. With the adjustment turned to the maximum, the object is still above the center of the Finder.I thought this telescope was suppose to be great for beginner, but I guess am even worse than the beginner. :("
3,Mediocre attempt at crossover,"Charlie Palmieri's recording for Atlantic was good but not spectacular. Much of this reaches phenomenal heights of improvisational latin jazz piano, but, in the interim, it is just so-so."
2,Not their best moment,"Backwaxed is one of those releases that you buy if you are a total die-hard Anvil fan. The title track is phenomenal, but the next 4 songs sound like demo recordings. ""You're a Liar"" is worth a listen just to hear how raw it is. I would love to hear Anvil re-record this track properly. The album is rounded off with 5 songs from their previous records. If you are just trying the band out, start with Metal on Metal or Forged in Fire."
5,"So good, I might buy another in case I loose it","I live in a country where construction materials are expressed in metric and inches at the same time (2""x4""x 3.2 meters), and I think and build in inches using U.S. plans (because at the end of the day all the materials are rounded in inches, even if expressed in metric at the store). You can imagine how much time I spend converting things between the two systems. This is totally paid for itself in shear time and errors about 1,000 times over in the short while I have had it.Not crazy about the case, but it does protect it. In fact I might buy like a fold out sell phone case so I can take some notes and such for it.So, I am seriously considering ordering another in the event I loose one or at least have another handy."
1,Defective Knock Off,This is a knock off calculator. It is not the same as the calculator Radio Shack sold for many years. My Sonin hung up after being used for three days. A pile of junk.
1,"Brilliant Album, But --",The money-makers' addings of extra tracks in order to sell it one more time destroys the original integrity of it.
1,prompt receipt - but not what was ordered,"I ordered a CD containing the Brahms Requiem plus Bruckner's Te Deum. The Te Deum was the piece I was most interested in, and it comes on many CDs along with other selections, so I chose the combo of the Bruckner and the Brahms to order. What came to me, however, was a CD of only the Brahms Requiem, which indicated to me that someone wasn't very careful in pulling the CD to ship. Since it would have been a hassle to return the erroneous CD, I simply ordered the Te Deum on another CD from another company, which cost me extra expense and time which I shouldn't have had to expend."
1,You get what you pay for,"I don't know why I thought I could get a decent caliper for [thisprice]. I don't need a caliper all that often, so I thought I didn'tneed the best. Live and learn. It arrived broken. The needle was not attached to the face of the dial. Overall, while the weight of the stainless is impressive, the construction seems flimsy. I've decided to bite the bullet and get the Starrett. As I've learned too many times now: ""buy the best and cry once."""
2,Guitar,"Ordered the kid's accoustic guitar for my 2 year old son for Christmas. Very disappointed when it arrived that it was so small. Once the item was removed from the box, the strings had to be tightened due to them being very, very loose. All of the strings broke when tightening them so my son could play with his new toy. This happening within 5 minutes of OPENING the box....not even PLAYING with the toy yet!!! I would not recommend this product to anyone else. Not worth the expense!!!!!"
4,Good Buy,My 6 year old grandson loves this gift. He has played it so much since Christmas some of the strings wore out.
2,one fall and it broke in half,"this product looked great..till two days later and with one drop it broke, the entire handle (or whatever it's called) broke from the base. Can't play a guitar this way. I gave it four stars for fun and educational becuase of the potential it had if more durable."
4,Gift,Bought this as a gift for my cousin's son. Have heard that he carries it everywhere. He has really enjoyed it.
1,COMPLETE DISSAPOINTMENT,"ya, i just got mine, and none of the strings work, and the things you twist at the top area all broken as well. basically 25 dollars i should have just lit on fire at this point. my son is now in tears because literally 3 minutes into playing it and its completely useless. he was looking forward to this for weeks. also, i did not get a bag or accessories....AND ITS ONLY 25 inches. its not even a real size guitar. i ordered the blue one, and it looks NOTHING like the picture. TERRIBLE PRODUCT."
1,oi-vay!,"Don't do it! Don't buy it! You'll be sorry! Give the $24.00 to a homeless person in the street - better spent!!I read some of these online reviews before I bought the book, - but did I pay attention to the negative one? Nooooo. I wanted to read this book so badly. I'm so interested in the subject matter, post WWII Japan, but for crying out loud, you have to wade through her archaic, disjointed sentences to get there only to discover that you have no bloody idea what you just read. So you have to re-read it, only to discover, it wasn't worth it. It's TORTURE! This book just is not worth the time it takes. I don't want fluff, I don't want Wal-Mart Book Club Best Seller, but I don't want to wade through THIS!!!!!!"
2,Let down,I feel the story just plodded along and did not live up to my expectations based on the reviews I read
5,a masterpiece of construction,"Hazzard manages to do two rather amazing things in The Great Fire: she consistently maintains a high standard of prose style, exacting, gorgeous, elevated, but never at the expense of drawing believable, interesting, sympathetic characters. She does this while advancing the plot at a rapid clip, fleshing out the characters with great skill, and fitting it all together in a seamless whole. For anyone who wishes to see how to masterfully construct the novel, there a few better recent examples than the Great Fire."
1,Reading this book was a painful experience,"I really wanted to like this book--the plot framework was interesting enough. But the execution--aaargh! Hazzard's language was excruciating to read. The dialogue was so stilted and unrealistic that it made me laugh out loud sometimes. And the characters were flat and undeveloped, as other reviewers have noted--I couldn't keep Peter and Aldred straight, they were so similar. I can't imagine what the awards committee was thinking when they gave this book the National Book Award. Yeesh!"
3,More style than substance,"There is no denying that the book is stylistically sophisticated, even poetic in parts. But that's really all there is to it. The book said nothing to me, did not really move me at all. It is a shallow love story about characters that never caught my imagination or my heart. Hazaard picked a setting that could have delivered so many important messages, and yet she ignores all of them. Nothing happens in this book. The story lines are disjointed and seem to have very little to do with each other. Background for characters is provided that does nothing to flesh them out or make them more human or understandable. Hazaard's prose - which I at first found extremely annoying because I do not think in sentence fragments as she obviously does - was cold and distancing. It takes more than pretty writing to be a great novel. It takes substance, and this book hasn't got it."
1,my literary reaction,"In the penumbrous, shadowy twilight, reading, alone. I come upon this passage - page 107 paragraph 9. The phrase "" Pattie's pusillanimous plait"". Tentative fingers play upon winter-scorched lips. The book is flung across the room. Discarded. Alone."
1,Truly Awful,"Shirley Hazzard owes me $24.00 for this book. Her pompous writing style obscures the basic plot to the point that I wanted to scream out loud. You feel nothing for the characters, mostly because their speech and thoughts are so affected that you cannot believe that they are human beings. The dialogue and speech is completely inappropriate for the time. She seems to forget that this novel was not set in Victorian England. Here's an example: ""There was also fascism, rife in city and countryside. At night, young men held the gladiatorial battles of an unequal civil war."" Personally, I cannot imagine an modern person speaking like this.To be fair, maybe it gets better in the end, but I couldn't finish it. It was supposed to be my entertainment on a cross-country flight. I ended up reading the airline magazine instead. At least the magazine wasn't supposed to be an award winning piece of literature."
1,Reading this was a painful experience,"I would not recommend this book to anyone. The author's wordiness is very hard to sift through and the plot is very much lacking interest. None of the characters are developed very well and in reading this, I often found myself in a state of confusion. It took deep concentration to finish each page and after reading some of the other reviews which suggest re-reading the book, I cannot imagine being able to get through the book a second time."
3,beautiful words but at times overdone,"It is very difficult to badly judge this novel given Ms. Hazzard's incredible genius with her words. However, there are two main problems that bothered me immensely when I was reading. The first is the undeniable similarity in plot between this and Duras' L'Amant, the only difference being the point of view of the narration. The second is the theatrical dialogue that passes between the lovers. This is particularly felt towards the end of the novel when one can not escape the feeling that they are performing for an audience when they speak intimately to each other. However, I was moved to tears at certain parts by the beauty of the love the passes between the characters, between Helen and Ben and Helen and Aldred. It's worth the read but not flawless"
3,Hard to get into...,"Let me preface this review by saying that the author writes with a very elegant and ethereal style that somehow transcends the horror and sadness her characters observe and endure....but, that said, I just could NOT get into this book and bring myself to really understand and enter the minds of her characters. I felt as if I were watching this story unfold from a great distance, and that the author did nothing to unpeel the layers of their personalities and bridge that distance. I know it won the National Book Award last year, but it's due back at the library tomorrow and is just not compelling enough to finish...."
1,"Boring, Over-Written, and Pointless!","This book was so boring I could barely stand it. In fact, I had to abandon ship halfway through. The main character is kind of interesting, as are the two kids, but the story itself is so slow-paced that the characters can't carry the book. I am a huge reader and I can count on one hand the times I've had to quit a book midway, but this one just couldn't hold my interest. I found myself daydreaming everytime I tried to read it. The writing was over the top...the author sounds as if she's writing to try to get an award rather than tell a story. Pretentious readers may try to act like they enjoyed this mess, but don't believe them. One of the worst books I've ever read."
1,One of the worst books ever!,I couldn't get through this book. I tried hard but had to put it down halfway thru. I was going to take it back to the bookstore for a full refund but I thought perhaps it was me so I lent the book out. It was returned to me partially unread as they couldn't make sense of it either. How can a book like this be an award winner? Wow....really bad. You would go along reading and you didn't know what was going on.Don't waste your money. I gave it one star instead of zero stars only because I had to click something.
1,"Over Rated, Unussually Boring","Some books, in my opinion, are just plain overrated. The characters in this novel are dull and uninteresting. Likewise the tale. The reader takes nothing from it. Put this in a list with Franzen's The Corrections and Frazier's Cold Mountain of award winning novels that did not deserve the accolades."
2,dialogue,"I don't know what kind of social life Ms. Hazzard has but this book has the most stilted, ridiculous dialogue I have ever read in a novel. People just do not talk to each other like she has them. In addition, the characters Ben and Helen as presented are much too intelligent for their ages considering their backgrounds."
1,The Great Fire: A Novel,"Ugh! What a boring book!In my Top Five Boring Books! (Snow, Reading Lolita in Tehran, The Piano Tuner, Accidental Tourist) just to give you perspective.Read Magical Seeds, or Lolita, or some Steinbeck.Don't waste your time here."
2,a big disappointment,"I simply can't understand why this book was a National Book Award winner. True, the writer is masterful at description, but the dialog is so stilted, so pretentious, that it mars what few assets the book possesses. I managed to get through it mainly because I thought that something would finally happen, maybe an unpredictable end or something....wrong. I certainly wouldn't recommend this book to anyone else."
1,A challenge just to finish,"I too, read the reviews and decided to give this one a shot. I enjoyed Hazzard's writing style, but the crawling story line was terribly dull and did not go very far. I could care less about the characters and their encounters throughout the book. The complete lack of drama was unengaging and disappointing, especially for a book set in the post World War II era."
5,shirley hazzard is a gift to the world!,"A book brilliant in conception, sublime in beauty, and crafted of delicate and profound power, The Great Fire continues to establish Shirley Hazzard as one of the pre-eminent prose stylists and novelists of international reach at work today. The novel won the National Book Award, and is a striking compliment to her 1981 National Book Critics Circle Award winning The Transit of Venus."
2,Like Bland Cucumber Sandwiches,"The premise of this novel was so promising- a love story between a 34 year old man and a 17 year old girl set against the back drop of the end of WWII and the bombing of Hiroshima. Unfortunately the book exhibits the detached observations of the British. The author uses pretentious language that is only available in the huge unabridged Websters. One could forgive this faux pas if the book was wonderful. Instead of a huge Italian repast we are served a light English tea with cucumber and cream cheese sandwiches. Skip this one. I only finished it because my book club chose it. However, most if not all of our members thought this was a dry pretentious novel which failed to fulfill its promise. Tho the protagonist makes a trip to see the sight of the bombing of Hiroshima, that is all we are told. There is no description of the site or the hero's feelings about it whatsoever. This is unforgivable."
2,depressing,"This is such a waste of talent. It was only published because Shiley Hazzard has written a better book. The story was dull, the unkindness of the parents most unreasonable. What kind of people would ignore their children this way? Depressing and a waste of time."
1,Stop... don't do it. This book is awful.,"The reviews all sounded so good I couldn't resist. I was hoping for another ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" but boy, was I disappointed. The story bounces all over the place, never seems to have a consistent theme and finally, turns out to be just plain boring. I'll give the author some credit; the imagery is nice and having traveled to many of the same locations in Asia myself, I enjoyed her descriptions of those places set in a bygone era. Unfortunately, the budding story of a war hero's longing for a very young girl (he refers to her as the ""Changeling"") made the guy come off looking like a pedophile. Seriously, pretentious readers will love this drivel; too bad I can't recover the hours I wasted on this schlock. With any luck, it'll be another 20 years before 'ol Shirley picks up her pen again."

5,Your mind has a mind of its own,"Everyone knows why we avoid the stuff we *don't* really want to do. But why do we avoid stuff we really *do* want to do? There are no easy answers to questions like this, but what an eye-opening experience it is to start to understand some of the tricks the brain plays on itself. This is an incredibly unique, honest book and God bless Dr. Flaherty - both for her ability to explain neurobiology to the uninitiated and, still more, for her willingness to bear her soul a bit. Buyer beware: This is not a self-help book. It's an intimate conversation with a remarkable person. It won't change your life; but it might alter some of the ways you look at life."
5,A wonderfully good book,"This is neither a self-help book nor a neurological treatise; it's a rich and wonderfully stimulating memoir-cum-analysis of a cluster of issues to do with brain and mind and creativity. If you like Kay Redfield Jameson or Oliver Sacks, this is the book for you."
3,The medical doctors songwriting book,The book was ok ...but it talks about a lot of medical terminology and doesn't really address writer's block. I didn't finish it but might though ..and it's a little in-depth for the average reader.
4,"ALL writers, please read!!!","As a writer who also suffers with temporal lobe epilepsy this book is especially close to my heart! Written by a neurologist at Massachusetts General it is written in easy to understand laymen's terms and encourages, as well as empowers, those of us who write, suffer with writer's block (which I do, often...:(), helps us understand our own ""creative brains"" (as well as helping our loved ones understand us).Perhaps some of you out there are epileptics and don't even know it! Epilepsy is an extremely ""varied"" disorder and the common kinds of seizures that everyone knows about are not the only ones that people suffer.A superb book!! Read it...AND WRITE!!!"
4,A doctor examines her desire to write,"I initially ordered this book after reading another review which mentioned it, in terms of writing, medication, neurology, in hopes that it would help with a problem of my own, namely the effects of Zoloft in quashing the desire, or need, to write. I only gave it 4 stars, because it didn't fulfill my own needs--it's an excellently written book and the writer is incredibly open and honest about her own life and circumstances. If you are interested in any of the subjects mentioned in the book's title, I think you would find a lot of information here."
3,it's okay,okay for made in taiwan made little small guess for the Taiwanese hands not as smooth as picture disappointing would not buy again
3,BOB friendly,"bought this to go into my BOB and i gotta say, for that use it's nearly perfect. It's light weight, small, and top heavy enough to get a decent swing out of, but that's all. just decent. In comparison to other hatchets i've used, this one excels in comfort and ease, but not workload. anything thicker than you wrist you ARE going to have a problem with. I'm really thinking about stowing it away actually. I have a kukri that works at least three times as fast as this thing, and is nearly as light. Like i said, if you're putting together a bug out bag, definitely think about this hatchet."
4,Great hatchet,"This hatchet is great, but the first thing I did was use para-cord to wrap the handle. The handle is too rough and needed some help."
4,Gets the job done,"My very first camp axe. Was deciding between this and a small machete. Glad I chose this. Bought it for light duty camp stuff like chopping wood for camp fires. However, since this was my first axe, it's not like in the movies where a couple of whacks and it chops clean. It still takes quite a bit of effort and good technique. I used it to chop a ""V"" notch into wood that was 1.5""-2"" in diameter and then finished the wood with a foot stomp.It definitely helped having it. It will be part of my camp bin that I take when car camping. Not sure if I'll carry it backpacking since it's a bit heavy. Also, I used the back end of it to tap down tent spikes.The blade is not razor sharp (not sure it's suppose to be) but sharp enough when you get some force behind it."
4,Good but heavy for size,"Like the sheath; saw other comments complaining but it does the job well. Sharpens well although did not come sharp. Like the axe overall for backpacking and only have two complaints. The handle is far to skinny. It is makes it less safe, more difficult to handle aswell as developing hand blisters. Other problem is that the advertised weight is wrong. Combined with the sheath the axe weighs 1.5lbs. (24oz). I think hindsight I might have gone with the gerber but I am happy with this one."
3,beware,"This set is priced right, but beware. The movies are censored and lets face it we love these movies for the the good parts. No naughty bits here, they blurred all the nudity parts. I was very dissapointed so wanted to warn others like me that watch these movies for the reasons I do that you will have to look elsewhere. Sorry cruel world!"
5,graylosophy,"An admitted novice, I was playing mainly with larger, lighter picks. When I got serious, an instructor taking me through the paces literally pulled my pick out of my hand, tossed it away and put one of these between my fingers. Now I understand. It's not about ""fanning"" the strings. It's about bringing your personality into the mix. This pick is not the cure-all, but it's helped me gain some punch and improved my voicing and prowess."
4,"Neat, itty, bitty pick","These work well for me and I like the smaller size - it makes them a bit speedier to use. Plus, the smaller size seems to keep the pick action more consistent and less floppy without having to grip it extra tight.They may not be so useful if you have really big ""man hands."""
5,Always loved these picks!,These picks are very quick and awesome for speed and dynamic guitar playing. They are perfect for pinch harmonics and fast tremelo picking and also grip really well. Highly recommend!
2,Dunlop: What have you done to these picks???,"I recently bought a few packs of Jazz IIIs and I was shocked. They don't play at all like what I was expecting. Under high magnification the edge doesn't look the same as the old Jazz III either, and they don't play the same if you turn them over!!! What's up with that?I'm sorry to give such a poor review to a great brand like Dunlop. Let's hope this is just a short-term fluke."
3,"NOT meant for ALL 42"" Flat Panel Televisions.","The reason I bought this mount was because I could hang my TV only 13"" off the ceiling and that it was cheaper than other mounts ($89). It looks identical to the picture and it is sturdy BUT the plate does not match to the hole patterns for my TV. I bought a Panasonic TC-P42G10 which doesn't specify the VESA size. So the TV is 42"" but requires the bigger plate mount which I THINK is VESA 400. So when you buy this product be aware that this mount is for VESA 200 or smaller and that your 42"" TV does state VESA 200. ""VESA is a standard pattern of mounting location holes on the back of a Plasma or LCD TV which allows many standard Wall Brackets and Wall Mounts to be easily fitted to your Plasma or LCD TV."""
2,No better than tourist bureau map,"I was glad to have an ITMB map when traveling in Slovenia and Croatia two years ago -- it had very good detail, even small village roads. But the ITMB Rio map was a waste of money. It was no better than any of several free maps available in Rio hotels. Spend your money instead on the Lonely Planet's Rio city book, which has better maps and very useful information."
5,WOW,WASN'T SUPPOSE TO GET THIS TILL TUESDAY.....WOW AMAZON....WAY TO GO.GOT IT TODAY.PERFECT CONDITION AND WHAT A NICE UMBRELLA.SO EASY TO GET UP & DOWN. DIDN'T THINK I'D LIKE THE MATERIAL ALL MY OTHER UMBRELLAS WERE CLOTH.I WILL STICK WITH AMAZON FOREVER I'M BEYOND SATISFIED WITH MY PURCHASE.THANK YOU
4,Very Happy,"Very happy with this umbrella. Was affraid it would be too small for my oblong patio table, but it's perfect."
4,Great Patio Umbrella,"Very nice umbrella. I was unsure about the less than 100% sun blockage, but this works nicely. I strongly recommend it."
1,let the sun shine in,I bought this umbrella and had to return it. The fabric is woven and therefore lets the sun still shine in. You would have to wear sunglasses while sitting under it. I liked the large size but not the material.
4,"Great umbrella, needs a compatible base","The material type was odd to me initially when I pulled it out of the package, but once I got it fully setup, it actually provided the shade I was looking for. I also like the style of the umbrella. I struggled however to find a compatible umbrella base to pair with this. Because it is such a top heavy umbrella it really needs a slightly taller slightly wider base. I could not find a decent one on amazon or in my general online search. I have a base now, the umbrella has tipped over once, but only when I had the umbrella locked in tilt mode. Besides that one hiccup I am happy with the umbrella purchase."
1,Not made for life,"This umbrella lasted me 3 months, then wouldn't go up anymore, it had a 5 year warranty from Coolaroo who wouldn't stand behind it.Thankfully Amazon stood behind this and sent me a new one, Amazon is terrific! Sarah in customer service was outstanding and I couldn't have asked for better customer service.However I don't trust anything made by Coolaroo now, and their products certainly aren't made for life!"
3,Returned!,"If you are looking for a grey (smoke) umbrella DO NOT get this one!. It is beige.If you are looking for a canvas sun blocking umbrella DO NOT get this one! The material is like the ""sail shade umbrella"" material. The sun is not blocked at all and it has a very plastic look.Other than that it was really well made, very sturdy and well packaged. It arrived very quickly and returning it was very easy too. My account was credited the same day it was posted back. Excellent customer service. That's why I gave it 3 star."
4,Great product - and great seller,"The umbrella is great looking, solid and easy to set up and use. Work as advertised. The only thing I wish they had was a cover for when the umbrella closed."
4,Nice Umbrella,"Very well made. The material is perfect and the color (Smoke) is very sleek. The umbrella is surprisingly lightweight. Gotta love aluminum! Easy to operate and easy to set-up. I am going to buy exterior shades from Coolaroo as well. Great products. I wish the umbrella poll was a tad bit longer. Other than that, all is good."
1,Coolaroo Umbrella,This Umbrella seemed like a good quality product when I first got it. It worked well for the first several weeks but then I tried the tilt function once or twice. The 3 position tilt mechanizm then broke and the umbrella became unable to stand straight up. When I contacted Coolaroo customer service I was told that it was probably a defective part but there were no replacement parts for it. Since 30 days had passed there was nothing they could do. Amazon would not take it back either. I would not buy another product from this company.
1,Not nearly as good as recommended,I bought two several years ago and they have not been acceptable. One broke after the first summer and needed to be discarded. The other is barely operable and wobbly. It tilts and is uneven on account of its lack of stability. It is also very hot sitting underneath these umbrellas. I was very disappointed in this purchase and would advise others to find more durable and higher quality umbrellas.
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"After just a couple of months the tilt mechanism broke. The umbrella now is in permanent ""tilt mode"". I had hoped that the high price might indicate high quality. Burned again!"
4,attractive and useful,The 11 foot width supplies more shade than the 9 footer that came with our 6 foot rectangular table which is great during long late afternoons. It doesn't completely block all of the sun out either and allowing for some air flow is a plus. I think it is a good value if you're looking for these parameters.
4,good umbrella,"So far this is a good umbrella. Keep in mind it is very top heavy, so you need a sturdy table and base. It works great for me."
5,Gatorback is top notch!,"i replaced the stock belt on my 2003 supercharged cobra that was slipping with only 7800 miles with one of these and it is still going 3+ years and 23,000 miles later. i will only use these belts on any of my cars. HTH"
2,This book is about Product Management,"This book is about product management and not product marketing. Product Marketing is more outbound and deals with messaging, sales enabelment etc."
2,On the Whole Dissapointing for a President Often Cited as Near Great,"I can't say I thought this was a bad book, I just can't help but think that the life story of a President, often cited as one of the top ten or ""near great"" in American history can only merit 138 pages. Wilson was also one of the most complex men who ever held the office yet very little is devoted to any of this. Rather we are given almost a superficial version of his life that are less then what Cliff Notes may provide.Very little information is shown on his first term and while the majority of the book is focused on World War One, we see very little on the tremendous social changes that took place during Wilson's term (prohibition, woman's right to vote) and how Wilson thought of them. Very little attention is paid to how Wilson destroyed the last vestige of equality by re-segregating the U.S. Government and basically barring African-American's from any Government protection.Very lite reading but sadly not very filling."
3,Where's the masterpiece?,"While Brands certainly deserves credit for sound, eloquent, and smooth flowing scholarship, shaping Woodrow Wilson's life and legacy is reserved for John Milton Cooper Jr.'s book. (Woodrow Wilson: A Biography)--Undoubtedly the best picture of the former academic, politician, and idealist thus far."
4,heard about this president on the radio,and wanted to add to my political history/bio librarywell worth the kindle downloadhave read part of it and even have one other woodrow wilson item on my kindle
5,Completely essential,"'Martes' is one of the most original and successful musical experiments you're likely to hear. Any description of it - such as 'glitchy minimal techno meets classical' - is going to make it sound gimmicky and contrived, but it's actually very natural-sounding and genuinely emotional.I could point to bits of it that sound like Aphex Twin, Cinematic Orchestra, any of Murcof's microhouse contemporaries such as Geeez 'n' Gosh or Andreas Tilliander, even Arvo Pärt or Jan Garbarek. But I won't, because any of that is likely to alienate someone, and all of it gives a false impression of the effect this record has.You'll have to listen for yourself, but if you're looking for an electronic/acoustic hybrid with sumptuous but refreshingly different textures, subdued yet highly sophisticated drum programming, and an enveloping sense of space, you won't be disappointed with 'Martes'."
4,ODD BUT ENJOYABLE,MAPA and MAIZ BEING THE OTSTANDING TRACKS....VERY CLEVER ELECTRONICS WITH SLIGHT CLASSICAL INSPIRATION
1,Truly Disappointing,"I must admit that previous reviews were an important part of my buying decision. I love minimalist and electronica and a range of music styles. However apart from a couple of tracks this was really not worth it. In this style I expect to be taken on a journey, like a flowing river, even if it meanders. However, this was not even close. Episodic and uninviting is a better description. I was disappointed - live and learn."
5,Consciousness,5 stars. This record is deep and accessible at the same time. A great performance and a fine recording.
5,Love this whistle,"I bought this whistle for camping. I am always leery about walking to the restroom in the middle of the night alone and bought this solely for this reason. At $5/each, it's a great deal! The whistle is loud and the light is very bright - bright enough to lead me through the woods down a small path in the dead of night. I keep the lantern in the tent! The compass works fine for a hand-held. The thermometer can get skewed if you carry the whistle under your coat close to your skin. We only go camping a few times each year and 3 years later the battery is still going strong. I would recommend this for anyone feeling uncomfortable at night! I'm getting ready to order more for my children!"
4,Perfect Fit,"Got this for my daughter's first birthday. She is about 30 inches tall and can walk confidently around all day. This bug is little but adorable and a perfect fit. She is thrilled by the springs/antenna. almost like having a small pet around, which is thrilling to her!!!. As for riding it, her feet are almost flat on the ground while straddling it. I think its going to take her sometime to get use to the movement and learn how to use it but what fun thats going be. As for workmanship, this bug is sturdy and the padding is cushy and soft but not enough to sink. The casters/wheels are fast so what out!!!!"
5,Great walker/ride-on,"When I was buying this, we couldn't find one locally to decide whether to get the large or the small, so hopefully this helps some...My daughter was 9 months when we got this. She is on the tall side for her age so we got the large size. It was just a tiny bit too big...she could just barely touch her tiptoes while seated. But she loved to stand facing it, holding onto the handlebar and push it around. Now that she is 10 months, she already can touch better while seated and can scoot a little. And she has mastered the mount/dismount."
3,"small vs larger & will she use it""?","My daughter is 18 months old & tall for her age (75 percentile). Size small was appropriate She could not touch her feet to the floor with the 'larger' model.I loved this toy, but we could not get her to ride it. She now has a wooden ""trike"" which she much prefers."
5,"Great for older kids, too!","I bought this for my 4 year old this past Christmas. I was initially worried that she would be too large for it. Those fears were quickly pushed aside when she jumped on proceeded to whoosh around the house. (She is 40lbs and 43 in tall.)The construction is sturdy, the design is simple and clean, the seat is slightly padded and the wheels spins in all directions. It is the perfect indoor ride on/push toy.I highly recommend this for all children."
4,"Wonderful, But it tips over easily","My little baby loves this toy. She is not quite big enough at 1 year to sit on it and ride, but she loves to push it around. My only hang up is that it tips over very easily. She has taken a few tumbles. But overall it is a great toy and I am happy with my purchase."
3,Well made but too small,This is a well made product. My grandchild is only 15 mos. but this is almost too small for him. If I were ordering again I would get the bigger size and let him grow into it.Prince Lionheart Wheely Bug - Cow - Small
5,Great! get the large,"this toy is very cute! The casters that turn in all directions are such a unique fun feature. This feature enables my 18 month old daughter to maneuver all on her own. This bugs size makes it easy to store as well. I would recommend the large size for sure. My 18 month old daughter can't quite reach the ground enough to ride the toy, but she has so much fun pushing it around. I wished I would have bought it for her a few months ago. It could have been a great push toy for several months, and then when she is tall enough to ride on, a ride on toy."
4,A little tricky for bigger babies..,"This is well-mad and cute as can be. My 20 month son likes it, but its kinda short in length so he tends to slide off the back easily."
5,Wonderful Toy,"I bought this for my 12 month old this past Christmas. I was initially worried that he wouldn't be able to do anything with it for another 6 months. Those fears were quickly pushed aside when he got on his knees and proceeded to push the bug all around the house, following his older sister on her large ladybug wheelie.The construction is sturdy, the design is simple and clean, the seat is slightly padded and the wheels spins in all directions. It is the perfect indoor ride on/push toy.I highly recommend this for all children."
4,Excellent quality,"This was a little smaller than I anticipated, so I was glad I purchased the large size. Its perfect for my 2yr old grand daughter and she seems to really like it. She can spin around the basement with her brothers on their Razor 360 bikes. Overall good quality, nice product."
5,Glad we got a Small,"Small works great for our 34.5 inch tall 22 month old. She rides around (""I'm zooming!"") no problem. At first it looked really small to me but she sits on it comfortably. If we got a Large one she would probably have issues with her balance. This seems expensive, but it is actually really nice in person - much nicer than I thought it would be - and seems like it will last us a long time."
4,Love it.,Our daughters grandfather got this for her and she adores it! She drags it around everywhere. We got the large because it will last longer and currently at 13 m she is to small to sit on it but she doesn't seem to care. I totally recommend it!
5,Fun and sturdy,"I bought three of these, one for each of my little nephews and niece. They love them! They can ride them or push them, and they don't get stuck trying to turn. The caster wheels allow them to move freely. They are made very well and will last forever. A little pricey but worth it."
4,Glad I Read Reviews,I am really glad that I read the reviews on this product prior to purchasing. Someone had mentioned in their review that it was smaller than expected. I ordered the large one based on that review. It is just the right size for my 2 year old granddaughter and she is small for her age. She loves it but I am really glad I purchased the large one.
5,We LOVE this product,This ride on toy has been excellent for my 11 month old. We got it for her for Christmas and she uses it every day. We like it because it goes in all directions which makes it easy for her to maneuver around the furniture. I also like it because it is small and does not take up a lot of space in our house.
5,Great Riding Toy for the Little Ones,"We bought this for our granddaughter for her 1st birthday. They come in 2 sizes, but we bought the smaller one for her. She loves it. At first, she just pushed it around and now she rides it everywhere. When she's 3, we may get the larger one for her.It's a sturdy toy, does not break. Comfortable with the foam filled ""bug"" part and the double wheels swivel easily as well as go any direction she steers it. This toy is not tippy - it is very stable and strong. It has a wood base under the seat part. It is well-made and adorable. I highly recommend it. Great construction and design."
3,"Not Great, but not bad","This toy was not what I expected. It is absolutely cute, but the size was a bit awkward. It's small, but the seat might be a little too wide for a 12-15 month old. The wheels are a bit of an obstacle as well. They move so freely that when they switch direction, it can run over toes (shoes or no shoes). Once my daughter mastered it, it was fun, but she quickly outgrew it. She literally was too tall for the toy. We kept it, but I wouldn't buy it for someone else."
4,Fun toy for little ones,"My daughter is really enjoying riding the Wheely Bug, Lady Bird. It is small enough for her to comfortably ride upon while we push her, but she cannot yet use her feet to push it herself. I think she will also enjoy standing behind it and pushing it. The cover on the bug is made of a soft but durable and wipable vinyl type material. The base of the bug is made of sturdy wood and the wheels are basic casters which we've been able to use on all the floor surfaces in our home. In all it is a very well made toy and should be fun for my daughter to use for some months to come."
5,Excellent ride-on,"We bought the 'Wheely Bug' for our son, who, has a lot of fun playing with it (riding on it/pushing it around/playing with the feelers)This is truly an excellent ride-on.-Its light weight and easy to carry around-Its sturdy-Its small enough that it can be tucked away in a corner-The wheels move freely, and so, baby can navigate turns very easily without having to back out or tipping overWe wish toys of this quality were easier to find."
5,My daughter loves it!,"I got the large wheely bug for my daughter's first birthday based on other reviews that I read. While she is still too short to sit on it and wheel around, she LOVES to push it around. I would definitely recommend this toy!"
5,Toy used all the time,Good toy. Kids love it. Play with it often. When other kids come over they play with it also.
3,seattle granny,It's as cute as the picture & I'm sure my granddaughter will enjoy riding on it once I get I get one that is all in one piece. The plastic housings for the rear wheels were shattered when it arrived and the wheels had fallen out. I should have checked it thoroughly when it first arrived instead of just opening the top of the box & looking in. I had hoped to give it to her for Christmas but now won't be able to. At least she is young enough (almost 17 months) that it won't really matter to her.
2,NOT for bigger toddlers!,"My daughter received this toy as a gift for her first birthday. It's adorable. There's no question about that. However, she's very big for her age (in both weight and height) and I found that she didn't fit on it at all. When she first received it, she amused herself by pushing it around the room. But when she got a little better with her walking and tried to ride it she would tip it every time she climbed on. The wheels are also so loose that this became a speed machine on our hardwood floors and I was constantly concerned for her safety. Overall, I don't feel that the price is worth the limited amount of time a child will have to play for this toy. I can not imagine a three-year-old enjoying this thing!"
2,Tiger Wheely Bug poor quality,"I am extremely discontent with the poor quality of the Prince Lionheart LARGE Tiger Wheely Bug!!! I purchased a SMALL Ladybug 2 yrs. ago in a store, and it has simply been an amazing toy for my grandson!!!! The Tiger Wheely Bug is smooth on one side, but the stitching on the other side is scrunched up!!! I think I will make all purchases in a store from this point on rather than from Amazon, so that I can see the quality I am paying a good price for!!! It looks like a rejection!"
2,Cute but not a fit for our toddler,"My husband and I thought this was whimsical and a great idea for our toddler. Unfortunately our toddler had another opinion. While our daughter loves to scoot around on a ""ride along"" type toy she did not have any interest in this particular product. We tried to get her to sit on it several times but she looked perplexed and would just push it away. We suspect that perhaps it was too small, however she is only 15 mo. and isn't an especially tall child. We ended up with a $23 plastic ride along by Fisher Price which she adores. Bummer for us and our clever ideas. We still think it is a really attractive and fun looking toy. Excellent craftsmanship."
5,My granddaughter loved it.,Received it promptly and our 1 year old used it as soon as we opened the box and took it out. Best of all it came ready to use.
3,Large is too big for under 18 months,"I read most of the reviews and decided to get the large Wheely Cow. I think it is tons of fun and can fly through the house on it (all hard woods), however it is 1) Way to big for my kids 2) Way to fast for my kids. They are 15 month old boy/girl twins, both average height (75 percentile) and I do not forsee them being able to reach the ground until they are 18 or 20 months old. Even when they can the bug is on chair coasters and is FAST! It moves too quickly to be used as a push toy....but I think it is a blast to cruise around on and super fun to do 360 turns on! I am a bit large for it...but it fits me better than the twins....I do not recommend for ages under 2"
