5,No Sleeping In THESE Pews!...,"Yep, the splatter scenes are here! Especially memorable are the ""Sledgehammer Suicide"", ""Subway-train Facial"", and ""Bell-ringing Granny"" sequences! However, this movie isn't just for goreh√ºndts, as it also has a cool story and the world's creepiest church building for atmosphere! A group of people, including a bride and groom, their wedding party, an elementary school tour-group, 2 bikers, and 3 priests end up trapped inside the church. Little do they know that demonic forces have been unleashed in order to fulfill a centuries old curse! THE CHURCH is a strong entry in the demon holocaust movie sub-genre. Services begin at midnight. Don't be late..."
3,Errr,"Weird movie! Odd monsters, cool concept, some gore, and a girl that everyone calls Latte or Lotte or something. Its has to do knights gruesomely slaughtering people which is gruesomely shown at the beginning(decapitations, impaling) all because they were some satanic tribe. Then the build a cathedral over their grave to bless the land. Well it ain't working in the future. I personally rented cuz of dario argento. Wasn't what i was expecting but ok movie.Rated Nr but should be rated R for horror violence/gore, brief bizarre sexuality/nudity, and some language"
4,"""The cathedral is the Devil's!""","Over the years I've watched THE CHURCH a few times on my grainy old videotape and I always liked the film, but now watching it on this crisp DVD by Anchor Bay THE CHURCH really comes alive. It's like watching a whole new movie!Back a few hundred years ago Teutonic Knights killed a bunch of people possessed by demons, then built a cathedral on top of the mass grave. Fast forward to the present day and thanks to a guy snooping around in the basement the evil spirits are loose and causing people to do some unusual stuff like suicide with a jackhammer and making love to a 9 foot tall goat demon.The story is a little confusing at times and often funny (the typewriter scene had me in tears), but any respectable horror fan knows THE CHURCH is well made and worth checking out, especially the scenes with a young Asia Argento. Mmmm."
3,Picture of product not accurate,"Highland 95001 Cargo Net show it covering a truck bed but the net I received shows on the box a net for a cargo carrier on top of a mini van. Since I have both a mini van (even though I have haul anything on the top of my van) and a truck (which I do haul thing in), I went ahead and kept it. I also do not pay much for it on Warehouse deals. My reason probably was why it was on Warehouse Deals anyway. Someone else like me purchased it for their truck and found out it was for a cargo rack."
5,Awesome wipes!,I love these flushable wipes! I have two toddlers and they both use them everyday. They are great for traveling too. I get them by the case since it is cheaper. They are awesome wipes!LBP
1,Item in picture is incorrect,The net shown in the picture is not the item for sale. I received the item a few days ago and it was not what was expected. I ordered the net for the rear of my 2008 GMC Sierra and this net is very small an can only hold a few small items. Do not order if you expect to put more than two small bags of groceries in your trunk.
1,Not what it says it is.,"The picture on the box and the picture they use to show what the cargo net looks like is not correct.This net WILL NOT HOLD GROCERIES like you see in the picture. It's too narrow.My Groceries will stay in the net, but barley. I am dissapointed in this product."
4,Neat item,"Gave this to my 80 yr old dad for Christmas, so he could use it in his new truck. He thought it was an awesome gift!"
1,NOT ITEM PICTURED,"As MANY reviews have already mentioned, the product that you will receive is NOT the item pictured. Instead of a net with pockets, I received a net without pockets that is used to press item against a bulkhead. This is more of a Amazon issue than a product issue but I feel like customers should be made aware of this problem."
1,terrible,they call this music it sounds like a wannabe pod and this cd is just pathetic i would not waste time or money on this cd if i could give 0 stars i would but you cant.
1,janky ass Cd,"This album is is WACK!!tHE FLOWS WERE GARBAGE.THE BEATS WERE WEAK.iTS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF RAPPERS AFTER THERE RICH, THEY FORGET WHAT ITS ALL ABOUT AND MAKE BAD MUSIC, WIT NO EFFORT PUT INTO IT.jUST CALUE THEY KNOW PEOPLE WILL BUY IT. tHERE JUST ABUNCH A TRICKS.PUNK SELL OUTS!"
3,Bang it shorter,"First I want to say that I didn't dislike the book, but I loved the story. The first thing to strike me was the lack of contractions. This made the writing seem stiff, at least to my way of thinking. I also thought there were a number of places were the story slowed to a crawl and almost stopped, even went backwards. Maybe it's the critic in me, but I saw many ways to step up the pace. But it was the story that made the book, not the writing. Wiggins didn't give anything up, by giving in to become Bruce's bosom pal, he only gained from it and grew as a man, and had a career season to boot. You would not need to be a baseball fan to find this story meaningful, just a human being."
4,Good One for a Mens Book Club,"My men's book club read this book. It has a lot of ""real men"" stuff in it. Baseball, friendship, bonding, locker rooms,mortality, etc. The members of the club enjoyed it a lot. In fact, one of the members who had been reading it over and over since childhood shared that he had read it probably 25 times.The plot is that Bruce, a third string catcher on the team, gets diagnosed with cancer and has a year to live. Star pitcher and author, Henry, takes it upon himself to make sure that Bruce doesn't get released from the team during his last year and that the last year is a good one. A movie of the book starred Robert Deniroas Bruce and Michael Moriarity as Henry.The book isn't very long, and we found it a good vehicle for encouraging discussion. I recommend it."
3,"""""BRIANS SONG""""---BASEBALL",OKAY---JUST OKAYTOUGH WRITING STYLE---YOU KINDA GET USED TO ITAFTER A WHILE. LIKE I SAID---JUST OKAY.
5,The great American novel!,"Why this isn't included in every list of the greatest American novels, I do not know. Using baseball, the perfect milieu for an American novel, as its starting point, and written in vernacular, it covers half a dozen subjects (friendshipo, dying young, loyalty, prejudice, etc.) effortlessly, while detailing the ups and downs of one season with the New York Mammoths.Henry ""Author"" Wiggen, the protagonist of Harris' equally good novel ""The Southpaw"", tells the story of his friend and catcher, dying of Hodgkins disease. It is smart, funny, sad and ultimately moving. You'll be surprised by the depths of this simple tale"
4,"enjoyable, easy read",has replaced The Natural as my favorite fictional baseball novel. A wonderful timepiece from the 50s
4,A page turner,"I loved this book. The writing is crisp, intelligent, and the plot is different. For once in a mystery I see true character development rather than just a whodunnit. There are plenty of twists and turns to keep you interested. Just when you think you have it figured out, you take a new turn in the road. If you like mysteries and you want characters you care about, this one's for you."
5,An Engaging New DI,"I usually just sit down and write a paragraph or so about the book I have just finished. This one is harder to categorize, and a summary will not do justice to the complex characters. A dancer disappears and Inspector Terry and his men have to find her or her body.Christine Spindler's THE RHYTHM OF REVENGE is a truly remarkable first novel. Jessica Warner, premier danseuse of a London dance company, star of ""The Taming of the Shoe"" disappears just before opening night, and DI Terry and his men must find her. Sounds like many other books, but it's not. Spindler's characters are all twisted, in one way or another. And the dance company is a tap dance troupe, not a ballet company. And the production is a hard rock version of a Shakespearian classic.If you are looking for a sense of place, it's really not there. The characters live and work in an almost claustrophobic arena that could almost be anywhere in the world. But it's their own, unique world."
4,one of the best post hardcore bands ever.,"Align's album blue book value is a quite amazing album. i was quite impressed that i found this at a sam goody, because they are on a small indie label out of minneapolis called blue worm records which you should check out because they have amazing bands on their roster. its an honor to be from the same state as such great musicians (they haved toured with boy sets fire)and if you like boy sets fire you will sure in the hell like align.i give this album 4.5 stars only because i liked some breaking news a little better, but pick this up if you want an attack of aggressive yet melodic hardcore."
4,Lasts for years,"We've owned this Little Tikes microwave for so many years and it's still in our family room. My daughter loved it as a toddler all the way up through kindergarten, which was just last year. She was always throwing things in there to cook. Funny some of the things that would end up there.It still looks as new as the day we got it and works just as well. It cooks and then tells the kids, ""Careful, it's hot."" Very cute.The only problem is the door, which can be difficult for very young kids to open. It should have an easy to grasp handle, but it doesn't. The kids have to push the ""open"" button in but grasp the edges and pull at the same time. They eventually get it."
1,A Junk DVD,This Synergy Archive Series is nothing more than a very bad copy of a VHS tape to a DVD format! Don't waist your money. The definition is lousy and there are black noise lines running through every frame. I made the mistake of giving my old VHS copy of God's Outlaw to Good Will before I viewed the DVD. My old VHS tape copy was significantly better than this DVD!
1,Rental Quality Unacceptable,"I rented this and downloaded it to watch later. The poor digital quality of what I downloaded made it impossible to enjoy the movie itself. If you get a good copy of the movie, I think it's actually a decent movie. But I'm surprised Amazon uses such a poor quality version to download.I don't know if the actual DVD's that are sold are better quality than what I downloaded or not (based on another review here, I'm not sure).Really disappointing."
4,God's Outlaw: The Story of William Tyndale,I really enjoyed this movie. I am not all that familiar with the accuracy of that time frame but it seemed educational and informative.
4,Important work done well on a budget,"We enjoyed viewing this video and learned more about William Tyndale and the events of the time because of it. Our whole family from 5-75 enjoyed watching it. Not necessarily a Saturday night entertaining movie, but for deliberate movie watchers this was good."
5,If you love to read your Bible watch 'God's Outlaw',This film is a wonderful reminder of of God's sovereignty in events of history and of the immense cost in terms of having our own Bible in English. The detail and accuracy of the film makes it a treasure to keep and watch more than once. The acting is very very good and the film can have a deep impact on those who have a desire to grow in faith and zeal for the Saviour.
2,'this is a very remote world I'm in now',"Strange little book with a totally silly plot: Caroline, a recent convert to Catholicism, has started hearing voices and a 'ghost typewriter'.Meanwhile her (Job's) comforters have their own preoccupations: boyfriend Laurence is investigating his grandmother who is part of a diamond smuggling gang (grandma Louisa is undoubtedly the best drawn character in the book- half gypsy with her Bulgarian cigarettes and taste for cooking offal.)His mother is only interested in her Catholic charity work, even towards the objectionable Mrs Hogg whom Caroline so dislikes; and her friend the Baron is obsessed with black magic...Spark's poetic writing shines through; I loved such phrases as 'Louisa sat beside the wireless cuddled in the entrancing carcass of Laurence's voice.'And I found Ali Smith's introduction (edition ISBN 978-1-84408-553-8) most enlightening once I'd finished the book...but I was glad to get to the end!"
4,Page Turner,"This short novel is surprisingly droll with unexpected plot twists. Written in the 1950's it deals with crime, pre-marital sex, and homosexuality with benign tolerance. The plot, in dealing with auditory hallucinations, may be autobiographical in part. I enjoyed this novel very much and plan on reading other books by this author."
4,What's it all about?,"This book's weakest point--a literary gimmick--kicks in early: a writer begins to hear a voice narrating her life, accompanied by, you guessed it, the clicking of typewriter keys. However, as annoying as this trite little device is, it has all but disappeared midway through the book, letting a somewhat more complex concept take over. The plot itself involves smuggling and tangled relationships, with a wink at English Catholicism. In the end, I've given this book four stars primarily because I enjoyed the setting, somewhere between the worlds of ""Lucky Jim"" and ""Excellent Women."""
4,Future Books Of Neighborhoods Of The Rest Of The Boroughs?,"This is one wonderful book. It gives a better understanding of Brooklyn's surroundings. I particularly found interesting the histories of Street-names. Now I'd like to know the histories of all the neighborhoods of NYC: Queens, the Bronx, Manhattan, and last and definitely least, Staten Island, particularly the neighborhood of Grasmere."
3,Disappointing,"Perhaps my expectation were too high. I lived in Brooklyn (Williamsburg) during the 30's-60's I was hoping for more! The author seemed unable to make up his mind on what he wanted to write about several of the neighborhoods I am familar with. He does supply information, some excellent pictures and history, but the ""whole"" lacks a cohesiveness that makes the neighborhoods come alive. It seems to me he spans the 30's to the 80's with lightweight strokes when the actual history was so much richer."
3,The Neighborhoods of Brooklyn,"This book gave a great overview of the neighborhoods in Brooklyn. However, if you are someone who is not at all familiar with Brooklyn you might be better off using this book in conjunction with other resources."
2,Not quite that good,"I would agree with the last two that the first reveiwer is a bit harsh, but it isn't a very good book. As both of the reviewers are from Tucson, I would guess that they know or have Dr. Soren as a professor and feel an obligation to give his book high marks. The book is full of errors and is not particularly well written. As course notes, it may be a handy resource, In fact I suspect that this book is just a typed version of his lectures. As fun or educational reading, it's a snore."
2,"Really, it's pretty bad...","Let me begin by saying that I have taken a class with Dr. Soren and that he is an incredible lecturer and acadaemic. HOWEVER, this book really is pretty disappointing. The title is intentionally provocative and misleading, something which Dr. Soren readily admits to in class. Furthermore, Soren admittedly hates most horror made post-1960's and sees ""Fiend Without a Face"" as the pinnacle of the horror genre. To his credit, Dr. Soren wears his biases openly, but if you are lookinig for a critical/theoretical examination of horror or an overview of the genre, I would suggest you look elsewhere."
1,great disappointment,"The real horror of this book is the poorly planned drivel it contains- Soren floats from topic to topic, fact to fact with little to no transitions, interspersing an unfounded opinion here or there- Classifieds are a more thought provoking and entertaining read."
1,"The few, The proud: The masochists!","Those who find Saramago's style appealing are masochists. His style reminds me of Conrad: There's a river flowing, for sure, but it is not flowing properly--it is missing a tad of music, a tad of poetry."
3,Angel Witch - 'Sinister History' (Zoom Club),"Angel Witch's story is like a total disaster. They're considered to be by some one of the most under-rated and under-appreciated bands from the 'New Wave Of British Heavy Metal' movement. I've read various good reviews about releases from this UK ensemble but I've come across vitually no fans of theirs. I mean, come on, someone out there has to be buying a few of their CD's. I know I have purchased a few. Anyway, founder / guitarist / vocalist Kevin Heybourne simply refuses to quit. Believe every few years Heybourne actually regroups with a 'new' line-up of Angel Witch. This disc isn't the best they have to offer, but it is a decent collection of demos of tunes from their first self-titled lp, like ""Sorceress"", ""Devil's Tower"" and ""White Witch"" plus six (6) live cuts from various gigs they performed in their early years. Pretty much for die-hards. But, if you happen to be a new fan, what the heck! Give it a try - you never know."
4,Enjoyable,"I enjoyed this book. Ms. Finnis is very knowedgeable about Roman history and roman Britain in particular. Her characters are very well drawn and I find the character of Aurelia particularly entertaining. Ms. Finnis gets more comfortable with each book in the series (I have read 3).That said, I sort of felt like I was reading Nancy Drew or Angela Brazil. There was such a ""jolly"" atmosphere about the characters. The contemporary slang seemed a bit jarring, and, as a previous reviewer mentioned, it went on far too long.All in all an enjoyable read-I would actually give it a 3.5, but I rounded up to 4."
2,Tedious romance-historical mystery,"This is a romance-adventure novel set in Roman Britain. I found it dull, with a female main character who in no case felt right for the period or setting, and a plot that verged on a 20s boy's-own-adventure - the main bad guy operated under the name Shadow of Death. I was hoping for a well-developed and imagined picture of the social setting and daily life that might have taken place, but did not find it in this book. A reader looking for a more believable and readable mystery set in Roman Britain should look to Rosemary Rowe."
4,Detailed historical mystery,"Finnis does a good job in re-creating a fictional small town in Roman Britain, but the story is not very suspenseful. Aurelia is a likeable heroine and hopefully will be in more novels to come."
2,Too long!,"There are a couple things I didn't like about this book. First, it was too long. I was bored about halfway through. I did finish it to see if it got any better, but it didn't. Second, I thought the author made the main character, a woman, a little unbelievable. I'm all for women's rights, but there's no way a woman in that time would have been able to do what she did. I don't mind a little stretching, but Ms. Finnis took it too far, I thought. If you're looking for something similar to this, check out Lindsay Davis. I have enjoyed her books much more."
4,fortune cookies do make for interesting scenarios,"I really enjoyed this movie, probably because I like Lauren Graham and Christopher Lloyd. It isn't an earthshaking drama, but very believable story about real life. Not what you would expect but a nice little film. Kept my interest and will watch it again and again."
3,not as good as vol 1&2,i didn't feel the words&music as much on this set as i did on vol 1&2.i feel this material was half good&half run of the mill.part preachy and indulgent.once in a while a good track comes on but for the most part not up to standards.
4,"Another greatest hits, but its still Billy","I would have rather had a new studio album, but what the heck. Many good picks, but a little to heavy on the ""Storm Front"" album picks (6). If your one of those part time fans and know a few of his biggest hits, than this is for you. It does have a good version of a Bob Dylan song ""To Make You Feel My Love"" which is from Bob Dylan's new album ""Time Out of Mind."""
2,It'll Be Twenty Years Before Volume 4 Comes Out!,This is a career that ran out of gas around the time of Innocent Man. Most of the songs on this volume do not measure up to the ones on Vol 1 & 2. Maybe Columbia should instead consider releasing the Billy Joel/Elton John concerts of a few years back. That would be a great release.
4,Second Joel Hits Collection,"Greatest Hits Vol. 3 isn't the essential album that Billy Joel's first hits collection is, but it still contains great music. Songs like ""We Didn't Start The Fire"", ""An Innocent Man"", ""Big Man On Mulberry Street"", ""The Downeaster 'Alexa'"", ""Leningrad"" and ""A Matter Of Trust"" are all great songs. The album gets knocked down a star for containing the insipid ""The River Of Dreams"" and the three new songs are nothing to speak of."
3,Little bit of a stretch,"Does have most the ""hits"" that Billy recorded in the 80s and early 90s, but leaves off Modern Woman, That's Not Her Style, and No Man's Land. Instead there are some songs on the album that would be hard to classify as hits - namely Baby Grand, Lenningrad, Goodnight My Angel, Shameless... None of these hit the top 40 as singles. But the other songs are good and its a nice addition.Now if he'd only go back and revise Pt 1 and Pt2 to include the regular versions of Pressure and Just The Way You Are. And put on Miami 2017, Summer Highland Falls, Angry Young Man, Honesty, and Sometimes A Fantasy."
3,A more mature(and sometimes boring) Billy Joel,"The third greatest hits collection has a number of worthy tunes on it. There's Joel's great tribute to the fishermen of Long Island, ""The Downeaster ""Alexa"" "", the history lesson of ""We Didn't Start the Fire"", and the delightful ""River of Dreams"" to make this a worthy set, but many of the songs, while popular, lack the fire and energy of his earlier work. Song after song moves along with all the skill of Billy Joel, the accomplished songsmith, but they blend together into something that approaches pleasant music you might enjoy shopping at the mall. Not bad, but pales in comparison with Joel's first two greatest hits collections."
2,Rather disappointed,"I consider to be one of the sincerest Billy Joel's fans this side of the Bravo. Frankly, I was rather disappointed with this one. The new songs were so conventional, so Un-Joel. I hope he will go back on his feet soon. We miss him."
2,Only 6 new songs added to his greatest hits!,Don't get me wrong. Billy Joel is Great. But this vol. 3 cd should have new songs added to the collection. Out of 17 songs there are only 6 that are new to the greatest hits collection. If you already have Vol 1 and 2 thinking that Vol 3 is the next series. You are mistaken! Vol 3 is over 75% of vol. 2.It is a good cd. But I already had all but 6 songs. Maybe they should have found some more of his great music. Or called it a mini addition to his Vol 1 and 2.
2,Don't get this one - Get 1&2,"I made the mistake of ordering this CD instead of Volume 1. Now I am stuck with one of what should be called his ""Worst of Hits"" including a remake of Garth Brook's ""Shameless"" (What was that all about???) Would rather have bought anything but this CD. Next time, I will listen to the snippet of each song provided before I get stuck with a really bad CD. Sorry Billy, this one was not your best selection."
1,Why?,"Gimme a break!Billy Joel haven't written enough good songs to fill 3 ""Greatest hits"" albums. On this, the third one, the only memorable song is ""We didn't start the fire"". Almost everything else is so boring it's hard to stand it. Obviously, the record company try to get as much money they can, and it works, since there's a lot of people with no personal taste in music. I even tend to believe that most of the buyers don't really like music at all. Know what I mean?"
4,"""Fire"" plus a bunch of songs you've never heard before","Billy JoelGreatest Hits Volume IIIDespite the great success of his novelty song of this period (""We didn't start the fire""), the eighties and nineties were not Billy Joel's best period. There are some very nice songs on this ""hits"" CD, but very few of the songs here were actually ""hits"". However, this CD does save you from having to buy a bunch of so-so albums to get these few gems. There is JUST enough good stuff here to earn it Four Stars, but it is not an essential CD."
4,Billy Joel - Greatest Hits Vol. 3,I love this CD. It came quickly and in good shape. Exactly what I wanted and more. A great value!
4,billy joel,"The C D was good but I only like a few songs - I'm not a big fan of his music - I loved "" We Didn't Start The Fire"".."
3,It's Almost As Good As You Could Expect,"This disc starts out with 3 good songs, ""Keeping the Faith,"" ""Innocent Man,"" and ""Matter of Trust (One of the Best)."" It also has an overlooked duet with Ray Charles (Joel said that it was the best experience of his life.) The reason that the first two songs on the disc weren't included on GH 1+2 was because they wanted to release two previously unreleased songs, ""Second Wind"" and ""While the Night is Still Young."" It leaves out ""Modern Woman"" for some reason and the tracks from Stormfront just aren't the same with out some of the others such as ""That's Not Her Style."" It did include ""River of Dreams"" and ""It's all about Soul."" Unfortunately it ends with three crappy cover songs which makes it seem that he's a washed out middle aged singer, which isn't true."
2,Opinion on Greatest Hits Vol. 3,"If you like Billy Joel you'll like this. However, if you're just looking for 'hits', this is not the one for you."
2,A Letdown,"This compilation is a genuine letdown from Greatest Hits Volume I & Volume II. It starts off in fine fashion with ""Keeping The Faith"" and ""An Innocent Man"", two great singles that prove Billy's musical and lyrical genius are still in tact. But then the album focuses on Billy's lifeless AOR-period. With the possible exceptions of ""Baby Grand"" and ""The Downeaster 'Alexa'"", most of these recordings seem tired and redundant. It neglects some of his best work from this period (""Big Man On Mulberry Street"",""No Man's Land"") in favor of lesser cuts from Storm Front, one of his worst albums (although he seems to favor this album in concert). For a more satisfying listen of Billy's later work, pick up River Of Dreams instead."
4,Great reference for your motorcycling library,"This is a nice book to complement your owners manual. I've already gotten my money's worth after completing two of the projects: bleeding the brakes and flushing the radiator. While this is basic maintenance, the owners manual doesn't really detail either of these projects (or recommends that you get the dealer to do it, which really isn't necessary because the author does a good job of describing the tasks). I also like that many of the projects are for mods you would make to a ""track"" bike, like safety wiring and some of the advanced suspension descriptions. Nice book, highly recommended for your library of motorcycle literature."
2,Its old,The book is very well written with many good ideas on how to complete certain tasks.The problem is the bike look very old and a lot of the technology has changed or comes standard on the bikes.Maybe I should have looked when this book was published.
5,Beautiful Talent!,"In short, it is a tragedy that this band has not received more recognition than it has. Jo has a beautiful voice that is paired with witty lyrics. The music is put together well and it compliments her vocals. If you get a chance to catch these guys live, then call in sick, steal the car, do whatever it takes... you won't be disappointed!"
4,"""Episode 2"" promises much but explains less","If Charles Grant dies soon I'm going to kill him! Words cannot explain just how addictive this series of books is going to become for me. Its like watching the X-files back when its was going from good to great. There is a lot more than meets the eye in the mystery of this small town, someone (or THING? ) is playing with Ethan Proctor, does it have to do with the murder in Atlantic City? Or the disappearance of that girl so many years ago? One thing is for certain, we are going to have to wait a little while longer to find out. So when is the next one, I cannot wait!"
3,novelty factor-10 song quality-3,"As a Beatles fan I love the concept and the clever play on words. The only tracks that are actually musically any good are 'Duckie' and 'Letter B' oh o.k and 'Hey Food'. As for the others, the titles outdo the songs. Great for the kiddies with a few in jokes for parents. I bring this one out for novelty value. Very cute..."
2,WHAT A WANKER,"If the only skill you admire is the playing of many notes in a short space of time, this is just great. If, however, you also care about the notes themselves and the musik that these notes create, than this is obnoxious. Why musik like this needs a singer ( god he is dreadfull ) and lyrics ( very generous term for this drivel) escapes me. Surely the only thing any MALMSTEEN cd has going for it is the soulless noodling at warp speed that he is good at. I would rather see him in a circus as some of his playing borders on the acrobatic - but musik it aint!!!Listen to ANDY TIMMONS. Similar if not better chops and astonishing compositions to boot. Not just many notes, but always the right ones."
5,"Goran Edman is fantastic at vocals, great music.","All the songs on this album are good. The music is very heavy, has alot of rhythm and Goran Edman's vocals are fantastic. This cd has popular tunes that made it big when the album got released-like Making Love, and Judas. I have to say that Goran Edman has a clean voice, and sings pretty well.(I strongly believe that he has been the best vocalist that Yngwie has had! ) I recommend this album to anyone who reads this summary. The music is good, the singing is good, and the cd has many songs. Goran Edman also sings on the ""Fire and Ice"" cd by Yngwie Malmsteen."
4,The Change,"Early Yngwie was great, of course, but something changed with this album. From Eclipse on, Yngwie's albums have an added dimension that I cannot describe. They feel somehow richer to me than the earlier material."
1,ECLIPSE OF A CAREER ...,"""MAKING LOVE"" ?? How on Earth MAlmsteen opens an album with a song owing this title ??!! Of course he intended to follow in the footsteps of the commercially succesfull ( but horrible ) album ""ODYSSEY"". But the result was catastrophic. He proved once for aall that he's one of the greatest guitar players ever to arise, but in terms of songwriting, he's a shame."
1,Sheer crap,"THis is Malmsteen totally lost and away from his metal roots. It's cheesy, po, full of flaws, impossible to listen entirely in the first time. Blergh !"
1,Poor quality,I purchased this bag only to have the plastic handle used to pull the bag crack on the second day of my trip. Very disappointed and I would definitely not recommend. I purchased the bag because of the good reviews but I am regretting this now. It could be a fluke but I am going to simply try to return it and get a different bag.
1,disappointed,"I travelled back to the UK with my new bag, and faulty stitching down one corner has already resulted in a gaping hole. This is very shoddy workmanship, and I feel like I was ripped-off. Now we have the hassle of my partner taking the bag back to the USA before it can be returned for a refund."
2,Big disappointment,"This bag is spacious and durable. However, I don't recommend it for the simple reason that it it doesn't stand upright. There is nothing more inconvenient or annoying than a piece of luggage that constantly falls over and won't stand upright when you let go of the handle and put it on it's end."
5,Better than The Twilght Zone !,"This series is terrific ! Cook up some popcorn , take the phone off the hook , put on your Depends .... You might just need them when you watch this dramatic sit on the edge of your seat drama ! The hair on the back of your neck will be sitting straight up ! .... "" Sweet Dreams "" ....."
5,"At last, a ""REAL"" study guide for Iannone's Sixth Edition","This was without a doubt the most valuable resource I used to prepare for promotional exam. And, this 2001 Edition is even better than its ealier edition, a book which contained many of the types of questions that were actually on my promotional exam. Don't let your competition beat you on your exam. Try this!"
5,Fascinating Look at a Psychology Pioneer,"This book provides a fascinating portrait of Harry Harlow, a psychology pioneer.The book also brings to life the theories of Harlow, who argued for the value of parental love and relationships when the behavorial psychologists (who studied rat conditioning) still ran acadenia in the 50's and 60's. I could not put this well written book down."
5,"All teachers should read this, too.","I am one of the millions of people in the USA with an education degree who are not teachers. Behavior theory is the rule of the school today. I couldn't figure out why we treat children like guinea pigs instead of like the human beings that they are. This book opened my eyes. There IS more to life than rewards and consequences. I think science has backed itself into a corner, though, because religion has a corner on the love and respect market and science has repeatedly assured us that all that spiritual stuff is nonsense. This book is a must read for anyone with an accessible heart."
3,A means to an end?,"This book can get a bit snoozy at times, but I respect Harry for his utmost honesty and willingness to be as brutal in his scientific literature as he was with the test subjects. From rape cages to this leave-the-baby-alone syndrome that still exists today, Deborah's work shines perspective on ethics, love, and even the infamous red splatters (PETA)."
3,Long versions of classic tracks,"I was a little disappointed with this CD. As a fan of Winwood and traffic I decided to add this to my collection.Most of the tracks are long, and are almost completely instrumental with little vocal from Steve.The guitar playing from Steve Winwood is exceptional however as is the band.It's not an essential disc if your a casual fan of traffic or Steve Winwood."
3,Plodding Traffic,"There isn't a thing wrong with the musicianship on this account of mid seventies Traffic. It is a bit tedious though, and likely set the pattern for supergroup live albums for quite some time. Traffic was running out of gas by this stage in their career. Chris Wood was not in the best of health, nor was Jim Gordon. Jim Capaldi and Steve Winwood would spend quite a few years recovering from the final crash before venturing into their very strong solo careers.These were the long songs, and while both Capaldi and Winwood could extrapolate brilliantly on a theme, this CD has the sense of having gone on too long. It tends to circle around for a while and then end. The defining track seems to be ""Uninspired"". {Perhaps Winwood and Capaldi had had enough and this is contractual obligation stuff. It is by no means bad, but this is definitely a band at the end of the road."
1,"""TRAFFIC WOES""","THIS TRAFFIC LIVE OFFERING IS ONE OF THOSE ""WELL IT IS TIME TO RELEASE SOMETHING FROM TRAFFIC TO KEEP FAN INTEREST""....THE SOUND IS MEDIOCRE AND THE MATERIAL PRESENTATION IS POOR.IF YOU WANT TO BUY TRAFFIC,BUY LAST EXIT,LOW SPARK,JOHN BARLEYCORN!DO NOT WASTE YOUR DOLLARS ON THIS CD!!!"
4,more gutiar!,"altho it's noted in these other reviews i have to mention the thrill for me is hearing so much winwood playing gutiar. when i would see them in the 70's he wouldn't play as much as he does on here but everytime he picked up his axe my jaw would drop, thinking this guy is great on this insturment, (no slouch on piano mind you..) so what a treat to here him do so many solos on here!"
3,Enjoyable entry in series,"This was an enjoyable entry, if a bit bland, in the House of Winslow series. I enjoyed the growth of relationship between Jolie and Peter again, as well as that between Phil and Cara. The Lanier family situation seemed a bit over the top, but it was resolved nicely. I'm looking forward to the next one in the series."
5,An Artistic Book,"I found this book to be as wonderful as the other House of Winslow books just as I had expected! I have enjoyed this series imensley and cannot wait for the next book. You will find it hard to set this book down once you start! Cara plans to stay in her room the rest of her life painting sad things, but Phil surpriseingly changes her mind. Will love bloom as well? Peter thinks Jolie is too young but she's fallen for him. They've been through so much together but she feels self-concise about her scar. Will he fall for another woman? Jolie finds herself soon having to care for the one Peter may love. Can she do it? To find out you have to read it! Happy reading!"
4,Mission Impossible Gift Set: Films 1-3,"All three of the MI movies in one set, handy at least. I am not, for the record, an MI fan. My family is though. I find continuity issues and it annoys me. I also bought MI4 and like it no better. For those into action films you should like these. They are not BAD films, and of the four I liked one and three best, they're just not in my idea of great films."
2,not relly a blueray quality,I have DVD version of all three movies and was really disappointed that the sound quality is the same. I also cannot say that visual aspect of the movie is much better. So if you own DVD there is no reason to buy this set - it is waste of money
4,Love All 3 Movies but NOT bluray quality,"My wife bought me this set off my wish list. Getting 3 movies in bluray format for $20 is a great deal. I love all 3 Mission Impossible movies and that is why I give 3 stars. However, I am not pleased with the bluray quality and that is the reason why I do not give this set 5 stars. I guess most ""older"" movies do not transfer well to bluray so I should be more lenient. Then again, for $20 you get these movies in bluray packaging and you get 3 movies. Maybe I should go ahead and give it 4 stars. I think I will."
4,Ethan Hunt in HD what more could you really ask for,Basing this review just off of the movies and the quality it was great even better than I can remember. The picture quality was awesome in blu. It was a great purchase.
4,Saving The Best For Last,"It's too bad Tom Cruise almost self destructed just before the release of MI 3, as it is undoubtedly the best of the bunch.Number 3 boasts an excellant video transfer and an outstanding audio track.Well written ,well acted and a great story.I think this would have been much better recieved if not for his bizarre behavior at the time.The first and 2nd installment also shine on high def.Number one being a great story ,and I felt number two was a let down but does look good in this video transfer."
4,It progressively gets better.,"The first two films, although redone in 1080p is still not quite on par with the 3rd. The first movie especially you see a little bit of grains. The second movie, you seen an improvement, but it's the 3rd one where you get to enjoy the true High Definition experience in terms of video quality and audio sound. But this series is really a must-get due to it's action and explosions. This HD DVD set is really a great buy."
1,Paramount's at it again (money grab),"""BEWARE"" This is the same sub standard blu-ray trilogy already released... They just repackaged it to tie in with the release of the new movie.If you already own the series on either DVD or Blu-ray format stand pat, for this is nothing new. The Blu-ray STILL only offers a Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack. It's just a shameless attempt at getting good people to part with their hard earned money."
3,Mixed,"Video quality was okay, but the case got destroyed before I received it. For the price it was a very good buy"
2,"Love the movie, blu ray not clear","Too bad you can't return movies. I bought the re-released Blu Ray of MI-1, and the transfer is simply not the crystal clear Blu ray picture i was expecting. I swear my VHS copy of the movie is clearer."
5,Now I have them all,I've been waiting to buy all three of the Mission Impossible Series. I was greatly surprised to be able to get them at the price offered.
3,"Great Film, Great collection - Average blu ray picture",These films are great to watch but don't rush out to get them on blu ray as there is only minimal difference between the blu ray version in quality to the standard dvd.Film 8/10Picture 3/10Sound 7/10
4,"New Packaging, Same Old Discs","I was a bit dissapointed to find out that the so called ""Extreme Blu-Ray Trilogy"" edition of the Mission Impossible films was nothing more than a repackaged original Blu-ray discs . The specs and artwork of the discs are exactly the same as the ones previously released, the only change is that the BD case artwork is different as well as the box. If you already have the previous trilogy box set there is no need to ""upgrade"", or better say ""downgrade"", since M:I 3 only comes with 1 disc instead of 2 as the previous set.If you never had them, go ahead, make the purchase, even better, Best Buy have them for $19.99 this week, and they include a $10 coupon for Ghost Protocol, so in essence you will end up spending only $10 for a 3-BD Box set. Not a bad deal."
3,Nice Collection,"I agree with this collection of mission impossible, both the audio and video are acceptable,but should launch a new edition package included Mission Impossible 4."
2,Paramount drops the ball yet again.......... This time 3x,"Once again Paramount takes very good (this time 3)movies and does nothing to enhance them for blu-ray release. These movies lack a lossless soundtrack and the video transfer is borderline at best. I'm going to have to do my research when it comes to movies from this house(Paramount). They should really look into remastering their products before releasing them to the public(Especially at the prices of Blu-rays). Don't get me wrong I loved the movies as such , but Paramount is giving us a bunch of almost HD products.I should have just stayed with the DVD's."
3,complete trilogy,"The first 2 movies are what you expect from this series. Well cast lots of action. The third installment is short on story, tries to hard to out Bond, Bond and is a dissapointment."
4,Tom Cruise still really good,"Tom Cruise has always been a really good actor, as he said on one of the UK TV shows, he did most of the stunt himself. I am amazied by all the stunt he did in this movie. Thought the plot is similar throughout the entire MI series, but the whole series is worth keeping."
5,BLU-RAY DVD,bought this item used and am very pleased with it.for thge purchase price here in alaska new is $90.00
2,not real pleased,"I was disappointed that a piece of cardboard is the stand for the ball.... other cubes had clear plastic and for less price... I made a bad choice, I should have chosen another... Price was too much for this product... it looks like something I could have found at The Dollar Tree."
3,stickin' to my guns,"etta james is a classic and there are some very good songs on this album. if you like etta you will probably like this cd, but i don't think it is one of her best. my major complaint was i thought the production and arrangements on many of the songs were too polished and lacked spontaneity. as such, they didn't seem to be well matched to etta's vocal style. perhaps this was an effort to make her more accessible to a wider, more rock oriented audience."
5,"just what I needed, good price.",I didn't realize until recently that there were extension cables for the computer monitor. This gives me so many more options on setting up my home office. Plus this cable has the audio extension which wasn't easy to find at other stores.
4,Does the job!,"I bought two of these to use as file cabinets and they do the trick. The simple design made them easy to put together. Once assembled, there are two means by which to connect (stack) them. My only difficulty; on the top and bottom of each unit are four small holes with stoppers. The stoppers only get placed if multiple units will not be connected. I didn't realize this until the the stoppers were in place. Removing them was time consuming and annoying, they had to be pried with a very small screwdriver or knife. I had metals handles in my tool bag and used those rather than the plastic handles included in the kit.The cubes look great in my home office. Most likely, I will buy another unit or two down the road."
3,"10"" does not mean the diameter of fixture","I had been searching for a replacement glass globe for a ceiling fan light fixture. I ordered this one and even talked to a customer rep who assured me I had selected the correct item. I only wish someone had put a tape measure across the base of the globe. This model does not fit a 10"" diameter fixture. It is, rather, 10"" across the widest measurement of the globe, which in a mushroom style globe is not the diameter of the fixture it goes into. I hope this helps other people to not make the mistake I did in ordering the wrong size. Ask them to take out a tape measure and put it across the bottom where it fits into the lamp fixture."
2,Sha Na Na YES! ...This CD NO!,"I do not want to be redundant. Read the other reviews given they are well done...these guys have talent and have always been able to walk the fine line between serious rock performer and a send up of the rock stars of the 50's and 60's. That is their genius. Unfortunately, it gets lost on this CD which has mediocre sound quality and incorrect tempo for some of the songs. Buy Sha Na Na CDs, just not this one!"
1,Sha-na-na Grease for Peace Album,"Also not impressed with the recording quality of this album, even with the bass turned on full!"
5,My Dad flew with him!,"I do hope this book will be printed again. My Dad flew with ""Pat"" Pattle in 80 squadron in the Western Desert and was one of his best friends. The book cannot be faulted for accuracy as I gave my parents a copy some years ago and they read it avidly. My Dad, by the way, was ""Old Man Evers "", so called because he was the oldest pilot on the Squadron. Enjoy the book and remember those brave lads."
3,"Nice Sign, but image lacking","I purchased this sign as a present for my father, the goat farmer, and he LOVED it! The sign is made from heavy-duty sign metal (like real street signs) and it has held up very well outside.The only problem that I had was that the image of the goat was a little pixilated around the edges, but you can only tell when you get close to it."
5,Dogmatic Reviewers,"This is an important anthology to add to anyone's collection of resources on Intelligent Design and the theory of evolution. It features essays by both supporters and critics of ID, and contains some of the most thoroughly researched materials ever printed in book-form by the ID community. See, for example, the paper on the Cambrian explosion.As more and more scientists become skeptial of the neo-Darwinian synthesis and even universal common ancestry, it's time to deal intelligently with the controversy surrounding Darwinism."
5,THIS CARAVAN IS REALLY WORTH GOING ALONG WITH....,"Well you have to read this book if u r a fan of suspense and intrigue.......this book has enough twists,turns and suspense.i am sure that anybody who reads any of macleans books will get addicted to him......"
3,It's a fast read...,"Caravan to Vaccares is a well-plotted espionage tale set in Europe against the backdrop of a wandering gypsy caravan.It's not without humor, and it's a fast moving story. However, the book lacks the characterizations of Maclean's earlier books, especially those dealing with World War II.The books he produced after this novel seem hastily written. Pick this one instead of Seawitch and Way to Dusty Death.Recommended, especially for Maclean fans."
5,Awesome Group sharing Gods love though different music,"I first heard Raze on WOW 2000 and then my friends bought it and the first time i found it in a store i bought it immeditally. i am so happy with this CD it it really different then most normal Christian cd's but the lyrics are so poetic and wonderful and the music and rythem is so awesome, if you listen to this music and you don't have the urge to dance there is something wrong with you. The music is so imspirational and uplifting and a real joy to listen to."
5,Outstanding! Not your average Christian group!,"I listened to Raze awhile back on a Christian sampler music CD, and I immediately fell in love! I just couldn't believe that such a different sound could come from Christian music; before then, I thought I'd heard it all. The music is both powerful, fun, guaranteed to get you on your feet, and bless your day. The first three tracks give you the full range and effect of their music, from the fast and dance-moving to the mild and groovy, to the slow and moving. And all don't lose a single bit of their ministering message in their method. My suggestion, folks, if you're looking for the perfect Chrisitan CD for the choosy teen or music and ministry lover, or if you happen to be one of the two yourself, then this is the one for you. I guarantee 100% that you won't be disappointed!"
5,GREAT,"I love this cd!!! It's all I ever listen to. I give it five stars, and I WOULD give it 100,000,000,000..."
3,An updated scroller,"Pay attention to the description of this game as arcade style. With that name and the connection to ""Neverending Story,"" I was expecting something lush, complex, intriguing. Instead, it's a 3D version of the old-fashioned scrolling arcade games. Your only mission is to run, jump, and collect ""Energy Balls."" Oh, the scenery is attractive enough, and some of those jumps are pretty nasty -- but it's not exactly taxing, and only marginally interesting."
1,Annoying,"Adventure games are the only type of computer game I am interested in, and I have played all of them I could find. This one is, without a doubt, the worst of all. Absolutely the only challenge to the game is trying to avoid falling off planks and rocks, something that becomes increasingly difficult as the game progresses. I got into the fourth world before becoming so annoyed and even angry that I quit and almost threw the thing in the trash. Not only is the game itself a flop, but my computer didn't even like it, freezing up at times in its own frustration.Another major problem with the game is that there is no way to save, so that unless you make adequate progress in a given world, you are forced to continue or else start that segment all over again in your next session.Graphics and some of the concepts are interesting, but those good points dimmed as my blood pressure rose. This is the only game I feel I totally wasted my money on."
2,Quite flimsy....,"I bought this flash stand for my hard tail bike, realize that its plastic material at the bottom bracket support area is quite weak. Upon fitting it up onto my bike, I realize I can actually ""bounce"" my bicycle like a basketball when gently pressing down onto the saddle. Its quite difficult to fit it up, reason that its fold-able legs and top arm moves around when trying to get it up and standing. The rear wheel ground clearance wasn't very high, not good enough for me to do maintenance work on my bike as the flash stand will ""bounce"" when I start to pedal the bike. Very disappointed with Top Peak products, I bought both their flash stand and tune-up dx, and was very disappointed with the design....I support Top Peak a lot, I bought their cycle bags and bicycle pumps which are very good, but it seems that their bike stand wasn't!!!!! Top Peak, wake up!!!!!"
2,handy device but not suitable for my folding bike,"I bought it and thought it would be ok for my folding bikes; however on the product description page, it didnot specify what type of bikes it is tended for. But there's more detailed description on the product which type of bikes the stand is to be used. but it is for sure a handy tool for the road."
1,Not durable enough,"I bought this at a local shop because I was doing brake work on my daughter's little mountain bike. To begin with, it's so tiny that it doesn't have the leverage to keep the bike elevated for long to begin with. I was using it on concrete, and it kept slipping after a few minutes, even on that rough surface. Also, the size only allows for maybe half an inch of clearance below the tire at best.Finally (and most importantly) the expandable part is made of plastic--I broke it within an hour of use."
2,Not a true work stand,"I held high hopes for the product - being that I live in a little apartment in NYC, I was looking forward to saving space. The tune-up stand is little/portable, however it was not too sturdy. The bike, while on the stand, will not withstand much torque at all. The bike fell over many times before I gave up and purchased another bigger/more sturdy stand. Forget about turning the crank, the slightest movement of the crank creates too much torque for the little stand and the bike falls over. This stand would be good for LIGHT work - possibly a light tuning of the brakes or a wipe down with a rag. Any pressure whatsoever would necessitate a bracing hand on the frame of the bike. Overall a 2/5 because it may be okay for a little person's bike or a bmx. I used it on a men's road bike size 57."
3,Good for round tube bikes,"This does not work with my Tri specific bike because the tubes are not round, built for aerodynamics. Other than that, seems good."
4,works well for what it is,"I've had this stand for 2 years now. It is, as others have pointed out, a touch unstable for serious repairs. I use a front wheel holder (riser ring) that I also use with my trainer to hold the front wheel and provide some stability and that is a tremendous help to this small and light weight repair stand. For the space constrained, it's a good choice if you're not going to do heavy repairs. If you really need to crank on your bike or play with brakes or gear shifts that just won't get into the right position, it may be a little lite for your needs. It is quite small and light and can be carried on long road trips for road side repair. Since I have my bike done at a shop at least once a year and would completely chicken out of major repairs, this suits my needs without causing more havoc in an already over crowded garage."
1,Brake sensor wire,"I had a problem with this item, the wires between the sensor end and the connector are shorter than the OEM item, so the connector will not reach the holder for it."
2,dissappointed,This watch was a great price but it arrived with no setup instructions. I have found it very difficult to set because freestyle does not have instructions on set up either.I guess I must return it because a watch that doesnt show correct time is really no deal.
1,Creative this book is not,"If you're in a design field such as architecture or graphic design, and looking for some inspiration or direction to help you with your portfolio, look somewhere else. This book is a waste of trees. The pictures are almost non-existant, and those that do appear are nothing more than clip art. The text is matter of fact and never strays from the blatantly obvious."
2,Should be placed under Comedy,"This movie is totally NOT scary, there's no thrill or anything. What a waste of money. The most horror action you get is from the cover of the film. I gave two stars for Comedy. I'll say it make me laugh!"
1,The Funniest horror movie,"This movie [...stinks] as a horror movie, but it is a great comedy. Believe me you'll be on the floor laughing, so buy this film for a good laugh and to ""scare"" the kids. This is definately not scary, and if you thought it was I'd like to know what you are on."
2,This Aint No Fairy Tale!,"Rumpelstiltskin gets trapped in a statue after saying his name 3 times and centuries later is released after a wish is granted, only in exchange for a mothers new born baby. So theres a cat and mouse chase to capture the mothers baby. The makeup design looks good, the humor is there and I had a few laughs but its a b-movie, which is lacking plot and performances."
3,"Very funny one-liners, campy","While this movie is not very scary,it has you in stitches with the amusing one-liners. Worth watching."
4,"Yes, this was in theaters","To answer your question, yes this movie was in theatures and I saw it not once, but twice. If you are going to judge this film on its filmatic achievements, or wonderful acting, its definitely not for you because the movie itself is horrible, and never quite reaches the bar that Leprechaun set for it. However, if you like funny horror flicks or are a fan of the Leprechaun series you should check it out, its pretty funny. One scene in particular sees good ole Rumple lose his head. The head is trying to tell the body where to go to find the head, its quite humorus."
3,The poisoned dwarf returns...,"An extremley funny (and gory) spin on a classic fairytale. The plot is pretty short and the characters are not all that brilliant but its a horror fantasy worth watching even for the humour of it all. It may sound like tosh, but hey, this ain't no fairytale!"
2,"More like ""Rumpled-Crap-Film","Ha ha ha. Okay, okay, I never even watched the movie. i just wanted to type that, but if it is anything like Leprechaun, then it sucks and I was right."
4,Allmans Live at Pre-Peak,"Live at Ludlows shows off the Allmans in a great informal setting at a small club around the time between their first and second albums. While not nearly as powerful as the Fillmore Concerts, this release shows off the band at a somewhat raw but growing more confident stage in their live performances. Gregg's vocals are a little hoarse, but still gritty. It's amazing how this 21 year white kid from Daytona Beach could sound like a 65 year old black bluesman.The 45 minute version of Mountain Jam which takes up the entire second CD shows what the band would soon become a year later - incredible musical interplay which show off the individual talents of the original line up. Any fan of the band for the short lived phase with Duane Allman will be pleased with this release."
3,This one is really only for hardcore Allman fans,"I consider myself a hardcore Allman Brothers fan and I would really only recommend this one to other big-time ABB peachead. If you are looking for a great example of the original ABB in concert, I would head straight for the Fillmore Concerts (expanded version of the classic At Fillmore East). The sound quality on that one is heads & shoulders above this one. However, if already owned Fillmore, Wipe the Windows, Evening with the ABB, and 2nd Set, I would then consider this one. All the others are superior and/or more unique than Ludlow Garage."
4,Student Account on Dutch Art Book.,This book is very well written and easy to understand. A good introductory style and works great to explain basic concepts of this specific time period and region. It's a-okay by me.
1,Buggy with OS 10.4.2,"Bought this card for my Dual 1ghz G4 Mac. The card caused all kinds of USB voodoo and problems when the Mac was put to sleep. When it worked, I was only able to get USB 1.1 speeds thru the hub on my Cinema Display. I'm going to do more research and find a USB 2.0 card that works with my Mac and put this one in my PC. Looks like the card has getten positive reviews from PC users."
3,The fine print for XP Users,"I bought this card because the PC I assembled was quickly running out of USB Ports for my peripherals. The other reason was I wanted a USB 2.0 card, which was claimed to be much faster than USB 1.1. When I checked comatibility, I saw that it was compatible with Windows XP, so I bought it. Only when I installed it, did I come to know that I needed to upgrade to XP Service Pack 1 in order for XP to be compatible with this card. This was an upgrade that I did not want, but was forced to do becuase of compatibility issues. So unless you plan to upgrade or if your system came pre-installed with XP SP1, you may want to think again. BTW, this is not IOGear's fault, but Windows XP (Home and Professional) is not compatible with USB 2.0 unless you upgrade to Windows XP Service Pack 1."
1,u can have my police collection,"great musicains great voice but what a bunch of phonies.you call outladous PUNK????? i guess you musicologists think music begins and ends with the beatles get real . u want punk try the dwarves maybe some pop jazz like sting tries to immitate,get the real deal STEELY DAN the voice sting wishes he had.every little thing she does,,,, god i cant even stomach it anymore. i do like Brand New Day though."
2,Have to agree,"Have to agree with L. Ackerman ""Weapon X""It's a great show and I really enjoy the overall story line. While I would love to fill an entire dvd shelf with just this show and spend a lot doing it, I'll wait. I intend on buying the Season when it comes out but until then, I'm just Netflixing the episodes.Looking forward to this set coming disc coming out. It looks really good. Unfortunately Planet Hulk had a preview for the episodes on this disc and major spoilers. Also enjoy the Scarlet Witch. She hasn't been having too good of a run in the comics lately so this is all she's got left. And she wants an entire season set of Wolverine and the X-men."
2,BE CAREFUL!,Opening up the iPod was harder than I expected. I actually broke a bunch of the things that hold it in there. Then when trying to remove the battery I broke the little cable that tells the iPod when the Hold switch is on / off. Whoops! So be careful when you use this kit!
1,Don`t be fooled!,"When you search Amazon for iPod replacement batteries, you`ll find other kinds that cost less, but don`t include that big CD that shows the replacement procedure. It costs around 5 bucks.I paid the $10 extra for the cd explaining what was the right way of changing the battery. When the shipment arrived, NO CD INCLUDED. I was very unpleased to see that a cheaper kind of battery pack arrived. Only a very small printed instruction was included. NOT WHAT I PAID FOR. Go for the cheaper kind."
2,Doesn't work with all 5th generation iPods,I screwed my $300.00 iPod using this kit. It says it works on all 5th generation but after taking mine apart and breaking turns out the late 2006 models take different batteries....so BEWARE. Sweet thing is Amazon is awesome and got me a refund promptly. Still out my iPod though.
2,Not a long term fix,"I purchased this battery in January 2009 and now, in July 2010, it's totally shot. Bummer!The installation was surprisingly difficult. I consider myself to be quite good with computers - why, I used to assemble my own! - but the iPod is indeed a tight package. Once opened, the power ribbon and connector proved to be quite delicate. I was able to finish the install successfully but I can't recommend this unless you're an expert. Initially I was pleased that my iPod's battery life was back in the 6-8 hour range but within the past month, it really took a nosedive. As of today I was able to just barely eke out two hours of play, and that was strictly audio and not even video.So that said, if you're willing to replace the battery - or the iPod - in a short amount of time, this purchase is fine. But don't expect this to be a long term fix."
2,Advanced features are broken,"This switch works well enough as an unmanaged edge switch.However, if you go to invoke VPN, you'll find the manual has nothing to say on the subject- the VPN section is actually a (poor) copy of the Port Configuration section. There is NO documentation from Linksys on configuring VPN.After a long round trip with tech support, and many tries getting it to work with two other brands of managed switch, I've come to the conclusion that the VPN features on this switch are broken, and not worth bothering with."
1,"Redo's, Re-records, Run Away !","Portland Trail Blazers; Rip City! Well ripoff anyway. This volume 1 is the same and a preluded to volume 2 and neither/either are worth your money.Right on the back label: 'Selected tracks are live or have been re-recorded by original artist OR other acts as availability allows'. And this is manufactured in the Czech Republic. Javelin Distribution is in England I believe and handles the sales.The two live James Brown and Marvin Gaye songs real are actually pretty good but isn't James or Marvin at his best. We have Al Jarreau filling in for Bill Withers again as on volume 2, I want Bill singing his songs not Al (again a fine singers but he isn't the original singer). Enough said, this really isn't worth the paper and plastic its printed on.Walk away, save the cash..."
3,"""Trying too hard""?","Make that 3+1/2 stars. I disagree with another reviewer or two: GG here is just coming off as the fine progressive band they were destined to become. In fact, maybe the perfect overall prog band. The complexity here sounds in-place to me, maybe just not as excitingly propelled as their later albums. This one may well be better than THREE FRIENDS."
5,Fufilling The Promise,"this is a quantum leap over the debut in complexity and strangeness. The band's signature style was put into place here, but the band was never really able to get this kind of atmosphere again, this creepy, paranoid, almost claustrophic feel that they get on this album. You can almost feel the walls closing in. Surprisingly, a lot of the album is quite happy. But the sound doesn't reflect it. Wreck is a highlight, though Pantagruels Nativity is probably the best. A must have for prog fans."
1,"Glitches on ""Acquiring the Taste"" remasters","This is VERY IRRITATING as the Columbia versions, while sounding muddier, do not have these problems.""Acquiring the Taste"" REPUK remaster has irritating clicks. ""The House"" 5:21 and 5:23. ""Moon is Down"" 2:40 and ""Plain Truth"" 3:48 and 4:31.""Octopus"" also has these clicks noted under the respective customer reviews (Thanks Philip Schultz).REPUK must fix this and offer exchanges!! These albums are classics (5 stars normally)."
3,WHAT AN UNUSUAL ALBUM!,"Gentle Giant's second album is definitely a very challengingalbum to listen to. It is certainly more complex than their firstalbum, but unfortunately, not even half as listenable. I respectwhat they're doing here, really! My two favorite tracks are"" Pantagruel's Nativity"", which has a wonderful heavy metal gui-tar riff from Gary Green and "" The Wreck"", which has some verynice singing during the verses. As for the rest,...well, it takesalot of getting used to! There are times on this album that itsounds like they're trying to make the music too complex to en-joy! It is a very daring and adventurous album, but it's not ashard hitting as some of their later albums! I wish I had a bettervocabulary to describe their music!!!!!!!!!"
3,One of the weakest effort by this unique and brilliant band.,"This is one of Gentle Giant's weaker recordings. Where one can acknowledge their collective efforts at experimentation they seemed to have suffered from the legendary ""sophmore slump."" The originality and progressive nature of their collective works seem absent here. The lone standout cut is Plain Truth. Still, for the die-hard fan it is worth owning. With the exception of Civilian and Giant For A Day you'd do better with any of their other recordings...Simon"
5,A Flower Fairies Postcard Book Review,"This little book is perfect if you want to send a quick 'Helloh, 'Thinking of You' or any other special occasion. It's quick and easy and Cicely Mary Barker captures these lovely,graceful and whimiscal fairies in great settings."
5,Flower Fairies Calendar,"All of the flower fairies captured by Cicely Mary Barker are sweet and charming, and possess an innocence that is rare in modern depictions of scantily clad sirens. A must-have for all fairy lovers."
3,Letting Go,"I truly loved ""Tuesdays With Morrie"" and couldn't wait to read Morrie's own words. While I found ""Letting Go"" to be insightful, it was a little too ""self-help"" for my taste. I would hightly recommend it for someone caring for a person with terminal illness or for a victim of terminal illness, as it has wonderful advice on how to understand and ""live while dying"". For the average reader, though, this book seems awfully long for its 127 pages."
4,Its worth the Change in your life.,I haven't read the book as yet but I did by it this afternoon. But i have seen the movie and judgeing by the other reviews they have produced the movie very closely to the books. The movie has Jack Lemmon and Hank Azaria they perfected the roles and its moving to see the book in living colour if you cant be bothered to read which i can't imagine not doing teh movie is almost as close as teh real thing worth a read and a viewing.
2,Morrie,"I was disappointed by this book. I loved Tuesdays with Morrie, and this book was too short, and not as interesting as the last."
4,NOT as good as MITCH ALBOM's TUESDAYS WITH MORRE,"Okay, I bought this knowing it would not be as good as Mitch Albom's TUESDAYS WITH MORRIE, but I was hungry for more of Morrie' words, wisdom, and inspirational aphorims. I wasn't disappointed. What an incredible man! His words continue to inspire me everyday. ""A teacher to the last..."" If you loved TUESDAYS WITH MORRIE, this book is worth buying. If you haven't read TUESDAYS WITH MORRIE yet, don't buy this book yet. Read TUESDAYS first, and then if you like that book, come back and buy this title for more of Morrie."
1,JUNK!! Crap!! BEWARE!!,"I have now replaced the clean water and detergent tank three times because it cracked and leaked!! What a piece of junk!! Hoover Customer Service is an oxy-MORON they have no service and all they say is there is nothing they can do! How about stepping up to the plate and admitting that the cleaner is of poor design and offering a new REDESIGNED tank that doesn't crack and leak after a couple of uses! What happened to the day when a manufacturer actually stood behind there inferior products......or better yet didn't make cheap crap and then hoist it on an unsuspecting customer! Goodbye Hoover and maytag for that matter I am forever burned. You no what they say.....burn me once your fault, burn me twice my fault! PS they need to add a zero star category!!!!!"
1,"So much for ""you get what you pay for"".....","I bought this steam cleaner, which was the more expensive one, thinking that it would last at LEAST 2 years with no problems. The fourth time I used it (and I'm only using it in one room where our ferrets live), the brushes stopped spinning. After pulling it apart, I found that the one little plastic knob/stick that turns all 6 brushes had snapped off. So, I now have to replace the entire spinbrush section (for $24.00 online). Then, I found that the upper tank was leaking tons of water - it couldn't even hold the water for more than 3 minutes. After again taking it apart, I noticed a large crack in the bottom of the tank. Now, I have to replace that for $55.00. I imagine that it got cracked when I had to repeatedly try to put the tank in place - which is extremely cumbersome and tricky. I am going to replace the parts since I paid several hundred dollars for the darn thing. All the ""gadgets"" don't mean much when the machine doesn't work...."
1,They do not make them like they used too!,"My Steamvac of about 10 years ago was a real workhouse with never a problem. I updated for the neat new features; and what a terrible surprise. The parts are extremely thin plastic that fit together poorly. Even with a new water tank, the solution runs down the back of the vacuum on the floor and inside the base of the vacuum in a few minutes. The brushes work occassionally. The water pickup is quite good if the lid is just perfectly in place. The roter brush hand tool would be great except all the water in the tank immediately makes one big puddle in the floor. This has been costly disappointment. The company has sold to Maytag; and it appears it will be discontinued. I bought this from eBay used and kept adding new parts to save my initial investment; since returning it would have cost me almost $100 shipping & restocking fees. I have now spent more than a new one costs; and have nothing."
1,Rinse Don't work!!,"I just bought this for 5 days, and thought of using it today. The autorinse/wash works but if you want to just rinse the carpet you just washed, it did not even work at all. What a piece of crap!!! They should have checked it before they sell it to the public!! Now my carpet is slightly wet, and I have to use hair dryer to dry my carpet.My husband just called the customer service, and the customer service was not even helpful instead he told my husband to return it to the store. The customer service man don't even explain to us what's wrong with it.Hoover used to be a good company with good quality vacuum cleaner /steamer. Now it's customer service sucks as well as the quality of the cleaners.!!So for those who thought of buying this steam vac. DON'T!!"
3,Hoover #F7431-900 review,"I've owned this carpet cleaner for about 1 year. Replaced the Clean Water/Detergent reservoir a few days ago ($75 for Maytag shop to replace the tank - ""Needs new tank"" - brush mechanism was not operating - mechanic was embarrassed when I pointed out that this was one of two problems requiring attention when I asked for an operation-check before I took the unit home - he fixed the brush-drive in about 2 hours at no charge to me). New $45 tank is leaking again on first use. Detergent tank is the leaker. After several attempts to figure out what is wrong, I applied petroleum jelly to the four vent-holes recess in the tank filler lid. Does not leak now. Problem is; how many of the four holes need to be sealed to stop the leak - sealing all four does, how about 3, or two, or one? ed"
1,What a piece of crap!,"[...] I have always paid for professional carpet cleaning in the past but thought I'd give this machine a shot. I borrowed a newly bought on from a relative to give it a shot before paying for one myself. They weren't thrilled with it but I thought I might have better luck. Wrong. This thing is so poorly designed it makes Fiat look like an amazing company. Backbreaking labor in order for you to actually get it to scrub the carpet. The problem is the design which is similar to an upright vacuum. You can't actually push it however. You have to bear down and drag it in order for the brushes to make contact with the rug. Almost gave myself a hernia to accomplish half of what a pro could do. Add to that the fact that you have to empty it about every 2 minutes and you're in for some serious work. Well, you get what you pay for. Its high time Americans stopped being willing to buy junk from these companies. Goodbye carpet, hello hard wood floors."
4,gearwrench set review,"I am an aircraft mechanic for a large regional airline and I purchased the Gearwrench set to use for aircraft maintenance. I am very happy with the quality and durability of the gearwrench set. The only hint I would suggest is to buy straight from the seller, because I could have gotten free shipping from the seller and I paid 7.00 through amazon for shipping."
4,Military Watch Cap,It is exactly what I wanted. It will work for what I had intended it to be used for. Winter wear.
3,BORING,"AS I WAS READING THIS BOOK, I COULDNT BELIEVE RICHARD WHEELER WROTE IT,,COME TO FIND OUT HE DIDNT. WHEELER IS MUCH MORE IMAGINATIVE, THIS AUTHOR DEY, OK FOR DETAILS, IF YOU LIKE TO BE A MINER,OR A REPORTER FOR A PAPER....NOT MY CUP OF TEA, STRUGGLED THRU, HOPE IT WOULD GET BETTER, LIKE A GRADE B MOVIE, NEVER DID IN MY OPINION."
2,Light reading,Buy Elder's trading for a living. This book is so light that I read it in one night and listed it on Amazon to sell the next day.
2,The concept is okay. The book is not.,"I did have great expectation on this book. I had been quite disappointed. Instead of elaborating on the similarities for playing pro sports and trading, it's more like a business management book emphasizing on setting achievable, strategic, measurable, controllable, flexible and positive goals of daily, weekly, monthly and yearly time span. I am not kidding. The authors did put tables of the above goals for you to fill in te blank. Though the authors also had chapters on motivation, concentration, pressure handling, routine setting, loss handling stuff but the coverage of them, in my opinion as a veteran trader and frequent trading book lover, were far from sufficient and sophisticated to help traders to turn themselves into a pro athlete and win this highly competitive game. The analogy is brilliant, but is only limited to the title. The content is not. It's just like reading one of those common psychology or life management books."
4,Book review,I found this book to be a good read.Having played alot of sport in the past I could relate to the advice that was being given.
1,"""No selling""?? Ridiculous!","Anyone who wants to build an MLM organization and thinks that they're not going to be selling is simply mistaken. I never did so much selling as I did in MLM. You have to sell the prospect on the ""opportunity"", and then you have to constantly be selling your downline - on the company's compensation program, on the company's products and, most of all, on the value of building their own organization.No selling? Then why is this book titled ""The 45-second PRESENTATION""??"
1,Stupid sale pitch,"Don't waste your money on it, just ask any Avon rep how they work and will be making a better decision."
5,A Must for the MLM Neophyte,"I believe this is the first book I've read on the sponsoring side of a MLM business that is for everyone. The reading is easy and you should be able to finish the book in an afternoon. If you are new to MLM this book is a must read. Don simplifies the sponsoring system, making it very easy to understand and implement. As a holiday gift idea - I would recommend buying a copy for every person in your down line."
3,It's alright.,"I've been in the NM industry for years now, and after reading this book, all I can say is ""it's ok"". It's got some good nuggets of info here and there...but I'll give you a word of unbiased caution: the analogies are overwhelming. I'm a person that likes to use analogies a lot when describing things, but this was way overboard. And, honestly, you'd have to be pretty much a semi professional artist to make it look right on a napkin to someone who's not familiar with the industry. A better suggestion is to read ""Beach Money"" by Jordan Adlar. It resonated much better with me, and you don't have to draw out fairly intricate drawings on 10 napkins."
1,Disappointed,"I was expecting a powerful 45 second approach to get a sale that could possibly change my life. What I found was a series of napkin drawings that, if I was an artist, and if I had a couple hours, I might be able to use and confuse a potential client or customer about my complicated way of explaining network marketing. This book was a waste of my money."
5,This is Exactly what I've been looking for!,"NOTE: be sure to purchase the 30th anniversary edition. I did not see any typos in it.I've tried this system on several people and the response has always been positive, even if the person was not interested. This is a great way to explain why you have chosen network marketing. The best part about this system is that you don't have to sell your product or the business. The system does it for you."
3,Too many numbers,"Everything was based on numbers---too many numbers. Most business is based on numbers--too much discussion was on the numbers---numbers for this and numbers for that. Good points were made throughout the presentation that will / can be helpful. Too much of this times that equals a result. Got it----it takes numbers to accomplish the success you are going after no matter what profession you might be in. Tried listening to the full presentation twice but shut it off each time because of numbers, numbers, numbers. Very boring for me."
5,Required Reading for Network Marketing,This book explains the concept of building a network of consumers to build wealth. It clearly demonstrates why no selling is needed and is absolutely essential for anyone that is serious about building a large team. Please note that there are two editions of this book. One is riddled with typos and has been slammed in other reviews. The ISBN for the typo filled edition is 1587217899. The ISBN for the corrected edition is 1887938958. This is the one you want to buy. I agree with another reviewer that giving the wrong edition could undermine your credibility. That's why I've included both numbers so that there is no mistake when ordering. Make sure you are ordering 1887938958 and you'll have no problems.
1,Decent ideas riddled with typographical errors,"I read this book in an earlier edition borrowed from a friend. I ordered it with the intent of sharing it with people. When I received my own copy from Amazon, I realized that to lend it out would seriously undermine my credibility. Here's why: almost every page has a distracting typo, including the back cover. Although the content of the book is arguably sound, the extensive typos in this printing compromise the message to the extent that the book is virtually useless. In network marketing, where the all-important goal is to establish the legitimacy of the industry and raise the level of respect for the companies and people involved, a book which creates the opposite effect should be avoided."
3,"GOOD READ, BUT...",This book has a lot of good information in it! I found it difficult to get past all of the typos in this particular edition. My friend ordered the same book (different edition) from another site and didn't have any of the mistakes that this edition had.
3,"MLM, this book says it like it is","The book does a very good job at both explaining MLM and teaching you basic methods to become a successful recruiter. I was shocked at how open it was about the goal being not to sell products to real customers but, rather, to recruit recruit recruit.Not my thing, as I prefer to find a business opportunity that actual customers want to purchase; vs being involved with something that puts the focus on recruiting rather than retailing. But if you feel differently then this book is for you."
4,just so cute and fun too,"i bought this for my 2 1/2 yo daughter this christmas. so far her and my 5 year old son love it and it must be a big seller since the price has gone up $10 in 2 months. i would have liked to see a more durable coffee pot as well, i imagine if it hits our tile kitchen floor a couple more times we will be glueing ours back together too. otherwise, even my nephews,4 and 6 yo, who are the ruff and tumble type--they like trucks and trains and anything they can jump on took time out to make coffee in their little cousins kitchen. it is just too cute."
4,READ REVIEWS BEFORE BUYING!!,"My Granddaughter loves to have tea parties and I though this would be perfect for her. Like some of the other buyers I could not get it to work until I sucked on the ""straw"" that brings the water into the pot.YUK! Also it is only $14.99 at Target and I think that bugs me more than anything else."
4,the best YoungBloodz album yet!!!!,"I was very surprised by this album. I am a big fan YoungBloodz, but I have been somewhat disappointed by southern rap in general. It seems to lack the creativity of the previous generations. This album is bound to be a classic for the Atlanta duo. It is has EXCELLENT beats and at least one song produced by super producer Scott Storch! That in-and-of-itself might be a reason to get this album. It also has some good lyrics! Get the album, you won't be disappointed!"
2,NOT A GOOD FOLLOW UP,"OK ITS BEEN 2 MONTHS ALREADY, ITS FEB BOUTTO BE MARCH... WHERE THE YOUNGBLOODZ... I HATE WHEN FOLKS HAVE 1 OR 2 GOOD TRACKS.. LIEK THIS..THIS IS NOT A GOOD COME BACK AFTER ""DAMN"""
3,Glass cage,I thought that this movie had some good twists and turns; Charlotte Lewis isn't bad on the eyes. I thought overall it was a decent movi.
4,7th Edition pulls itself into the 21st Century,"Having had to wait many weeks for the new, revised 7th Edition I was very pleased to note the improvements made from the 6th Edition. The color examples, universal legend symbols and easy paragraph read for the student are excellent. Another long awaited addition is the expanded Medi-Cal section (applicable to California only). Having been in the industry for 25 year I can say that this is the best Billing book on the market that I have been able to find. The only down side to this book is that it is not written for the ""new"" biller, but more for an intermediate to experienced biller. As long as the instructor can ""dumb down"" some of the excellent explanations, students will learn a tremendous amount from this book. I use it in my classroom along with my own material and the students are leaving the class with a well rounded knowledge base. Over all, I am pleased with the new Edition and it's contents."
4,not bad,"the seller send the book very soon but she give me a wrong one, and then she send me another one, but it was lost in the way. Although she returned my money, but I took a course two weeks without textbook."
4,Good tools that need more soul,"Not that I disagree with the author. As far as discipline concerned, this book offered wonderful method for behavior modification that I would gladly apply.However, this book doesn't cover psychology of children (which is exactly my intention of buying the title) nor give you understanding of their behavior.If you are looking for simple and ready-to-use method of disciplining your children, this book is for you. But if you are looking for deeper parents-children relationship, you need to find elsewhere."
1,A self esteem killer,"My child attends a school where smart discipline is used. I have a child that never had a discipline problem and loved school. Now, he feels that he can't do anything right in school because they send home this ""smart discipline"" (behaivor sheet)home everyday pointing out everything he did wrong. It even gave us the impression that our child was having a problem. I don't like it and think it's just focuses on the negatives (most things that are not even really behaivor issues), without any positive reinforcement. Children are constantly looking for approval and praise from those they love, not constantly be reminded when they aren't perfect. Maybe this is good for those kids with discipline problems, but I don't think it's worth sacrificing the other kids, to get a couple of others to act right."
5,Highly Recommended!,"Diana Rowland has written the classic guide to Japanese business etiquette and to the impact of Japanese culture on business and social interaction. Extremely thorough and fascinating, this guide covers all the traditions you need to understand to do business with the Japanese, in Japan or around the world. A good read even if you are just culturally curious, the book includes Japanese office layouts, diagrams showing where business guests should sit around the dinner table, and information on interpreting gestures at business meetings. Rowland covers the business and social roles of women and the difference between the real truth and the public truth. The book's final 50 pages provide a wide range of helpful, general resources, including important phone numbers and a glossary. We from getAbstract recommend this book to anyone doing business with the Japanese, anyone who plans to visit Japan for business or pleasure, and anyone who's just curious."
4,Indie guerrilla filmmaking at its truest,"It's hard to find a movie that looks like it was truly made on the outside of the Hollywood churn factory. It may be rough in places, but that's also what's exciting about it. If you listen to the commentary track, you'll hear some fascinating stories about how they put this film together, like using an $8 tripod, or shooting in different countries within the same scene, all sorts of anecdotes that remind me of Orson Welles putting his later films together. Sometimes it's a little slow, but it makes up for it with the totally unexpected twist at the end. It was shot in countries like Cambodia and Laos and the scenery is great!"
4,YUM,"Clearly my favorite treat I learned about while traveling in Greece. These are a little salty, but overall taste like the real deal. Have them as a starter for a great Greek meal or put them on a plate of mezedes with some feta, dolmathes, olives and spanakopita. Don't forget the ouzo or a great Greek wine."
3,Interesting but all over the place,"This video is intriguing if you have a previous interest in the subject but was a little hard to get into and felt scattered. I am glad to have seen it though, a must watch for anyone interested in gender variance."
3,So Faux,"99% sure I got a fake so beware. Bottle looks a little cheap. Color of the cologne is wrong. It should be a nice rich green. It is chartreuse yellow/green instead. Scent is close but not on the mark. Maybe I just got an very old bottle but it seems like a ""good"" knock off. Meaning, at least I can wear it without hating the purchase but I do feel ripped off. Maybe this is all that is available anymore. Is this even still in production?"
1,Don't buy this shirt,"What they don't tell you is it's made of gauze or something similar. The tag says ""Line Dry"". I haven't bought a shirt in 30 years I couldn't dry in the drier. As a result, one wear, one wash and it's got one huge and about 15 small holes in it.My son's first Pirates shirt was a horrible waste of money."
4,a neat little read on the Soprano family,"This book is well written, but it is not much more than an extended newspaper article. Gabbard enjoys himself opening up some interesting lines of thought and giving an overview to the series. Well worth a look."
2,Full of mistakes,A large number of obvious mistakes about the plot make the book a very irritating read.
4,Narrow gate review,"Well writen murder mystery. Suspense keeps you wanting to read more. The tale of the two estranged brothers is heart breaking and intrigueing. The twists of the rich Texan family and the secret lives they lead and try to cover up.Even though its a tale of murder, there is a somewhat beautiful delicacy of religion and family values intertwined into the plot. The wife of the half-brother is remarkably strong and faithful. She stops at nothing to find the truth.I highly recommend this book."
4,A wonderful adventure,"The Poellenberg Salt is a priceless masterpiece of gold and jewels which was given during the rise of the Hitler regime by Princess Margaret von Hessel to General Bronsart. The general is now living secretly in Spain and one day he sends one of his friends, a mysterious Mr Black, to see his daughter Paula Stanley and inform her that the general wishes to bequeath her the Poellenberg Salt. But there are others who claim ownership of the Salt and who are equally tenacious to retrieve it. And so starts a breathtaking chase after the Salt which soon brings several parties to Paris where it is supposed to be hidden. And the violent history surrounding the famous Salt seems to begin to repeat itself. Excellent listening entertainment with this audio book with Mr Sean Barrett's agreeable voice."
1,Very Displeased,"I am very displeased with this purchase. I had bought this case for a friend as a gift and it came in the mail today. The case in the picture is not what i received exactly. When my friend tried putting his phone inside you could hear the case stretching and cracking as if it was going to break. It was very light like the others said, will not be purchasing again from this company."
1,Nice looking very fragile,"Terrible quality, product fits nice and looks good, ads a bit of bulk to your phone. I had it on for two days and my phone fell from about 3 feet once and the case broke, one of the narrow sides cracked off and once cracked it cannot fit on the phone anymore, will not buy again."
2,Bamboo case split!,I like the way the case feels and looks but this is my second one buying now and both of them have split! Will not be buying another one!!!
1,DISAPPOINTED,"Not only did I wait three weeks for this case, but within 2 minutes of attempting to put the case on my iPhone 5, it broke. I am truly upset. Box wave needs to create a case of quality. THIS WAS A WASTE OF MONEY"
4,Sesame Street: Numbers,Cute cd teaching children numbers. My son loves it. The only downfalls is it's too short!! I like this cd better than the ABC one....
5,Great!!!,"This is the missing link between Against Me! and Scared Of Chaka. Nearly flawless. If you like good ol' rockin' then this is the disc for you. Also for fans of Toys That Kill, Gunmoll, etc. Grandma's Cootie could very well be the best rock song ever recorded!!!"
1,"Bad card, bad support. Don't but it.",I've got the card to connect my Ipod (Win) and so far have been unsuccessful. It turns out that the card is not 100% OHCI compliant and windows keep scrashing every time I plugin iPod to its firewire port.I would recomend to buy a true 100% OHCI (Open Host Controller Interface) compliant card.I'm returning this one.
5,excellent card,"a buddy needed an external hard drive to back-up his business files and bought a ADS Tech Turbo 2.0 usb pci card for $45.00at circuit city and the drivers for it were bogus to the max...I popped this baby in, in 5 min. with no drivers no hardware wizard and xp made sweet love to this little honey. Hooked anoptical mouse up and bam! so we then hooked the HDD up and Viola'. Maybe that other dude should buy an apple computer tohook his precious little ipod up to and leave the PCs to pros yo..."
3,Good book with a good message,"Diversity Alliance, which takes place firmly in the second story arc, sets up a lot of historical and ideological action within the Star Wars universe, and in addition to being entertaining, it provides a good view of xenophobia and bigotry and general.Recommended for everyone, but especially young adults."
4,Blood+ Saya figure,I got this for my daughter for Christmas. She loves it. I shopped around and found that this was definitely the cheapest price I could find on the internet for this figure by about $15-$20. Thanks for the good price! It was shipped well and very fast.
2,Well...,"listen people, i dont wanna be a hater, but this action figure really sucks! im a big fan of the bloodplus series but this figure isnt good, it would of been nice if saya otonashi was on her own instead of being held up by hagi on one leg. the details are kinda good, but the whole point of this figure is useless,to me, its rubbish, i am ashamed, and i hope megahouse actually makes some figures from blood plus that are worth it, like amshel, or nathan."
2,don't buy it,is it worth it? Perhaps as a trinket only not sure where it would fit in any collection? I own it only for fun but would not recommend it. I hate to give a bad review but this is not the tops in any collection.
4,Nostalgia with fine women actors,"This book discusses the role of women in film, particularly those women from the earlier years of film that were fast-talking and smart. This is a great record of how film tried to sneak intelligent women into their movies, even though society at the time dictated that women should be docile and silent.A great analysis of women and their roles in United States history."
4,Fast-Talking Dames,"The author, Princeton professor, captures the captivating use of dialogue in the delightful ""Fast-Talking Dame"" movies of the 30's and 40's. Her almost lifelong love of this genre is easily conveyed to the reader. Well worth the reader's attention."
1,Disappointed!,"I love screwball comedies! I have seen all of the movies dissected in this book, and love them all. I was looking forward to an interesting informative book about these great films. Instead, I got long dissertations on what the directors were thinking while they made these films. Being less than comfortable with the concept of the director as the true author of a film(after all, they did use screenwriters, often bringing in others, or even a team, to ""punch-up"" the script)it seems foolhardy to subscribe all the ""Emersonian"", ""Darwinian"", etc., themes to these films. When all is said and done, they are fast funny films, made to bring in the public and give them a good witty evening. This they accomplish with great gusto. For the most part, this book just made me tired. If you want to learn anything new about the films, watch them."
2,WRONG DELIVERY,"I received a book in a timely manner. However, it is the wrong book! and intended for somebody in New York City! (I live in Little Rock)Just emailed the seller about this, hoping for a response. will update later."
5,great trio of punk music,"i got this album after seeing them live. this band is great punk rock. the songs two weeks and so discustedstand out as my favorite. even if you dont fully like punk rock, this album is for you, your frioends and your mom"
3,Nice for 1 year,"Set-up is relatively easy. Just be sure you get it in 100% direct sunlight and be patient the first time while the pump gets primed which may take a couple of minutes. Birds seem to enjoy it but I wonder if more or different birds would use it if it were in the shade. The fountain helps keep mosquitoes at bay which is why I like it.Unfortunately, mine cracked after less than 1 year. The warranty is two years and the company is shipping a new stand and bath under warranty. So save that receipt!"
2,Gone,"It was nice when it was new. The base screws in and is not steady, the solar pump feature only worked when the sun was directly overhead (and we live in the southwest). After one year, this plastic bird bath became nearly impossible to keep clean. It's a nice idea, it just has a few design flaws."
2,I would not recommend this,The fountain was a big disappointment. It had to be REALLY sunny to get it to work at all and it didn't work for long. It was a gift and I don't like my recipients to be disappointed.
5,An enduring classic,"The best recording by the best male gospel voice--anointed and heartfelt, if you don't mind some aggressive guitar here and there. IMHO, this is one of the top five rock / pop Christian recordings ever released, and it should be better known than it is.P.S. A long time ago, Russ did a duet called ""The God of Who I Am."" It was a great song, but doesn't appear on any of his recordings, as far as I know. Any chance of that being released on some sort of collection?"
1,Cannot recopy this product.,"I love the music on this cd but it has the protection in the software that it cannot be recopied so I can mix artists. I do not illegally copy or put music on the web, but I like reburnable music in my computor so I can remix songs and artists when I burn cds."
3,Somewhat Dissapointed,"Some of the recipes I tried in this book called for items that were found to have onion flavoring in them. For example Campbells Chunky Chicken Soup has onion flavoring in it. Onion is very toxic to dogs, and I feel that the book is somewhat contradictory. On a positive note, the book taught me to read labels before putting it in my dog treats. My Great Danes are grateful to that as well. Wouldn't want to hurt these beautiful creatures, or any of my other canine friends."
4,"""The Ultimate Dog Treat Cookbook"" is great!",I really enjoy trying all the recipes in this fun book. For valentines day I made heart shaped cookies for my classmate's dogs and everyone said they were a big hit! I bought the book myself and it even comes with a free kit. I can't wait to make more treats and make a variety of things for my dog and new puppy.
2,As previously stated....not a beginners book,"I own a dog treat business as a part time keep me busy type venture. While this book has a lot of recipes and ideas, some are complicated and require a lot of time to be spent purchasing items that aren't otherwise in the average kitchen. While the book itself isn't horrible, being a regular dog treat/food maker, it isn't the most user friendly or beginner type book either."
5,The Ultimate Dog Treat Cookbook: Homemade Goodies for Man's Best Friend,"There are lots of easy, healthy, fun to make dog treats with things you already have in your cabinets. It was worth buying and I am very happy to have it on my bookshelf."
3,Disappointed,"This book was a birthday gift for my young teen daughter. She wants to start her own dog treat business, and we felt this would be a good place for her to start. Once I saw all the pre-made ingredients, I was disappointed because I don' t cook that way for my family. The sodium content should be considered also.Since she will be selling these treats I recommended she stay away from any controversial ingredient.Overall the book has some great ideas, and she is excited to get started. The recipes are easy enough for her to follow on her own. I told her we'll work on making the questionable recipes her own. The puppy can't wait for us to start either."
2,dog biscuit recipe book,"This book wasn't exactly what I expected, some of the ingredients called for are foreign to me, and some of the recipes call for canned dog food, as in the chicken jerky. That is exactly what I wanted to avoid! Kind of disappointed with this book."
4,For people gaga over their dogs.,"Generally I am more of the Milk Bone school of treats but for those rare times when you want a quick project in the kitchen, these are fun."
5,This is MY kind of Book!,"Can't wait to use the recipes in this book--i'm busy and don't have the time or money to spend on organic products. For an occasional treat, products in my kitchen will work for my dog! The book arrived quickly and was well-packaged."
5,Variety of Treats,"The doggie cookbook had a good variety of recipes. I used three recipes from this cookbook to make cookies for a ""Best Friend Christmas Stocking"" donated for a fundraiser. It was a big hit!!!!It's great to know what ingredients go into your furry baby's treats, and the helpfull hints and advise were beneficial."
4,Awesome info!,The recipes are just about good enough for people. It has awesome nutritional information throughout the book. The recipes seem rather easy but I have not tried since the book is for a friend.
3,Questionable Editing,"In an op-ed published in the New York Times on July 20, 2009, a close friend of Hemingway's, A. E. Hotchner, has questioned the grandson's editing of the book, which Hotchner claims was exactly the way Hemingway wanted it when he gave it to him (Hotchner) to drop off at his publisher's back around 1960 or so. The op-ed renders grandson Hemingway's work dubious at best. You may want to snap up the originally published version of ""A Moveable Feast"" soon, as it may be your last chance to read what Ernest Hemingway actually intended for you to read. As Hotchner's article points out, the implications of Scribner's action in publishing this ""restored edition"" is indeed troubling. Caveat emptor."
5,please read Hemmingway,This was the best experience I have ever had reading.I read it when no when was asking me to (i.e. not a college requirement). I didn't expect anything from it and I compeletly fell in love. It is a beautiful and sacred little story.
4,Part of my fantasy fulfilled.,"This is one of the two Hemingway book that I've read. The other one was The Sun Also Rises, this one is definitely more interesting and enjoyable. I think he is more descriptive and sentimental. I like the fact that he wrote this in a very nostalgic tone. A good book to read next to a fire place, or under a beautiful tree. It takes you to a place, and vicariously I lived with him when he was a young man in Paris."
1,A Travesty,"This ""restored"" edition is just the heirs' way of changing things around to make the heirs' grandmother look better. No thank you. I really despise revisionist history."
3,To read or not to read?,"I quickly read this memoir after reading The Paris Wife. I was interested in knowing what Hemingway had to say about Hadley and how he described his mistakes (he admitted) that led to their divorce. He dedicated a chapter to this explanation. I felt they were Hemingway's words. However, since the memoir was not completed before Hemingway's death, and since various family members were ""editing"" the outcome of the memoir, I did not give much credence to the rest of it."
2,Less Than Perfect,"I bought this book after reading, A Paris Wife, which I truly enjoyed. I thought this would have more of hisfamily life along with his travels, but I found it to be more of a drinking book with not much substance.I was disappointed and sorry I spent the money for it since it isn't available as an e book and it wasn't longenough. I struggled to finish it, and as an avid reader that doesn't happen very often.Barbara Ryan"
2,Can never decide with Hemingway,"I'm not sure if I'm the only one that feels this way - but its just that Hemmingway is so hyped and supposedly amongst the best authors of the century. But I just dont see it -for the life of me I cannot get over his 3 word sentences. "" she was pretty."" "" we drank some more"". "" I went to bed"". Its like reading a seven year old's story book. For me to enjoy a book, it has to engage me in more ways than one - the language has to be beautiful. The story has to captivate me completely. As much as I try to like him, Hemmingway just doesnt seem to prove his worth - I've read The Sun Also Rises and now A Moveable Feast. I dont think I'm going to pick up another Hemmingway."
1,Just awful,"I should stop reading Hemingway books, I just don't seem to understand his popularity although I understand he's a literary great I just don't like his writing. This will be the last EH book I read. To me the book was all about nada or nothing as one of the chapters is titled. He probably deserves his fame but I'm not a fan of his. Give me a Steinbeck book anytime. He's a great writer."
2,A Moveable Feast,"My husband down loaded this for me,so this is from a female prospective. The book was for my book club. We first read the fictional rendition of Hemmingway and his first wife, Hadley,of their time in Paris, The Paris Wife and then Hemmingway's A Moveable Feast. I found Hemmingway's account slow and boring. I realize of course that The Paris Wife is fiction and A Moveable Feast is the memories of Hemmingway 40 yrs later so I recommend that if you read both you do it in a reversed order. I kept thinking that Hemmingway was leaving a lot out about his life with his first wife and getting miffed with him with being so self absorbed. Not logical but that was my experience."
3,A Moveable Snack,"Still don't like him.So why did I give it three stars? Well, it is an interesting book in that it gives a view of Hemingway's nature - and it doesn't really matter if he's being actual factual in his descriptions of himself or of his acquaintances and ""friends."" There's a particularly ugly account of a non-encounter with Gertrude Stein that he ""very nobly"" doesn't relate - but by even mentioning the incident in the way he did showed a desire to expose another person's humiliation. And his descriptions of Ford Madox Ford are most unkind.""The Paris Wife,"" by Paula McLain, although fiction, gives a more detailed account of these years and is more even-handed in descriptions of individuals personalities and character. It was very well-researched and appears to be quite true to the events that occurred between Hadley and Ernest Hemingway during that period."
2,hard to continue reading...,"I am a big fan of biographies, memoirs etc but i just found this to be a very boring, hard-to-continue-reading monologue about EH just walking around writing and drinking. I have read books about Hadley, EH's first wife, that I really enjoyed and thought this may be a good read but this one was lost on me. Not a fan of this book whatsoever."
3,Blatherings of a tired old writer.,"Hemingway was a terrific writer, but in this autobiographical novel, there's a lot of arrogant posturing and a sense that he remembers the best of himself and the worst of others. And unfortunately, his exhortation to himself to ""write something true"" is largely a mantra which is ignored. Skip this book, and read his short stories."
5,"Review of Hemmingway's ""A Moveable Feast""",Excellent book! I recommend it to anyone remotely interested in the talent of Ernest Hemmingway.
5,Why this book is Hemingway's most entertaining.,"Hemingway utilizes an interesting short-story-type format to give an excellent feel for Paris in the 1920s, the artists who lived there, and his own character as a young man. ""With Pascin at the Dome"" is my favorite section of the book; it never fails to instill in me the sense of contentment that Hemingway experienced in his simple living and extreme productivity. The style is typical of the existentialists; the prose is lean and content is exceptionally easy to glean. This book is a must-read for all Hemingway fans."
1,The book had absolutely no plot!,"The book A MOVEABLE FEAST IS ONE OF THE MOST BORING BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ. BECAUSE THE STORY HAS NO PLOT, IT'S SIMPLY ABOUT HEMINGWAY AND HIS WRITING, AND HOW OTHER PEOPLE SAW HIM AS A WRITER. I WOULD NOT REFER PEOPLE TO READ THIS BOOK, UNLESS THEY ARE LOOKING FOR A GOOD BOOK THAT WILL PUT YOU TO SLEEP...."
3,insight on hemmingway,I found this book gave me a more favourable picture of Ernest Hemmingway than I other wise heldI got to know the man from his own words and not from his criticsThe Sun Also Rises
1,Not the book shown,"The book shown is the 1965 paperback edition. I paid a premium price to get this edition. Instead, the seller delivered the 1996 edition. The content of these books are not the same. Hemingway's son edited the 1965 edition to produce the 1996 version. The 1996 version is less interesting; it also puts Hemingway's son's mother in a better light than in the 1965 version."
5,A feast indeed!,"Poor, hungry and happy in Paris! Lovely stories of a young writer and his company of artists, particularly about F.Scott Fitzerald, Ezra Pound and Gertrude Stein. Refreshingly real and even modest side of the young Hemingway, working, loving and living...and some hilarious and human episodes. This was a wonderful travel, and peak into the Parisian life in the 20's. Very very lovely!"
4,Remember Hemingway,Introduction a little confusing but interesting. I would have like an even longer.explanation of how this book got published. It was good to read Hemingway again.
4,"""All you have to do is write one true sentence. Write the truest sentence you know."" -Ernest Hemingway","I rate this book four stars, as opposed to five, simply because it is (understandably) a bit dated and can lapse into an unfocused ramble at times, and I feel that only fans of Hemingway and American literature will really appreciate it. But if you do happen to fall into that group of readers, this book should definitely be feasted upon! It was very interesting to read of Hemingway's interactions with such heavy hitters as F. Scott Fitzgerald, Gertrude Stein, Ezra Pound, and James Joyce. And the setting, of course, is remarkable - Paris in the 1920s. For English majors and romantics, ""A Moveable Feast"" is perhaps more magical than any fantasy novel."
3,Hemingway autobiographical novel,"I enjoyed this book, but I did not like it as much as other Hemingway works- particularly The Old Man and the Sea and For Whom the Bell Tolls."
5,A feast for sure.,"I re-read this little masterpiece for the umpteenth time on a round tripper from Seattle to Chicago (just about the right length). It seems to be a perfect travel companion.I agree that it's helpful to be familiar with Papa and his novels to really appreciate this quite different work. The fact that Hemingway was also an astute reporter (a la Steinbeck) also heightens the wonderful readability of A Moveable Feast.We get to see the man's appetites, fears, weaknesses, and strengths as he hobnobs with the Lost Generation on a daily basis. Writing with the laser-like clarity that changed the course of fiction, he fixes in time the Paris that romantics like myself wish they could have experienced."
1,"Don't Touch ""Moveable Feast"" (this is a bad edition)",This says it all...[...]I love this book just not this edition done by Hemingway's grandson. I just don't like when people inherit intellectual property and change it.
5,"It is better to be a poor man in Paris, than ......","What starts as such a wonderful beginning with so many promises, sadly ends in a tragic finish, just like Hemingway's real life.The first few chapter evokes such strong images and feelings that no author can sustain such a toxicating mixture without causing a stupor in the reader.Is the book worth every dollar and more, of course, but just like the city of Paris, the author seduces you and then lets you know you are just another mortal on a brief visit to an eternal city."
3,"Read for Hemingway, not for Paris","In preparation for an upcoming vacation to Paris, I thought I'd give ""fine literature"" a try. I have to admit I'm no fan of Hemingway. I just thought it would be great to see the City of Lights through a writer's eyes. My mistake was choosing an writer I don't really enjoy. Hemingway depresses me and this memoir was no different.Bottom line: If you are a Hemingway fan, you'll love his take on the city. If you are looking for a book set in Paris and aren't already a Hemingway fan, this may not be the book for you."
5,A must read!,"This is one of those books that you simply have to read. It transports you in time to a place you wish you were and a life you wish you had led. This is perhaps one of Hemingways best books. It's fun to read about people he actually interacted with. These are historical figures that are well known- which makes it all the better. As a side note, okay a pretentious side note, people NOTICE when you are reading Hemingway. They look at you like your just a bit above the crowd. They should- Hemingway was amazing. If you haven't read it- pick up a copy. If you have- read it again!"
3,Hemingway from the inside,"I have to keep reminding myself that this was written at a time when people seemed to think it was ""clever"" to be ascerbic. Very hard to read when incomplete sentences and thoughts are just thrown out there as though the reader is also a 'familiar' with the characters. I kept reading because I had also read ""The Paris Wife"" and the characters are from that book. Hemingway has always been said to be one of the best writers, ever, but, I am finding his work difficult to keep reading."
4,Good Insight into Ernest,This book was read after A Paris Wife and fit with it perfectly. I loved the chapter on Hemmingway's trip with Scott Fitgerald. The scene in the hotel dealing with a hunt for a thermometer is perfect.
4,My Favorite Hemingway,"Something about Hemingway's account of his years as a struggling writer in 1920's Paris is incredibly endearing. As a glimpse into his thoughts about the circle of friends he later christened the lost generation A Moveable Feast is a very quick and entertaining entre' into the world of Gertrude Stein, James Joyce, Scott Fitzgerald and others. I enjoyed it for it's descriptions of Paris cafe life and the commentary of these writers on the issues and the literature that was inspiring them at the time.I haven't read Hemingway in a long time and this was probably a good selection for me personally as it will inspire me to go back and re-read some of his better known novels."
4,Ernest Hemingway,"I was curious about Hemingway after seeting the new Woody Allen movie, Midnight in Paris. I found the book very interesting in conjunction with having seen the movie. I might read his first novel later which I believe is The Sun Also Rises."
3,Hemingway in Paris,"This book was immensely entertaining because you get to hear about what certain authors were like. We see Gertrude Stein, Ezra Pound, F. Scott Fitzgerald, James Joyce, and T.S. Eliot all through the eyes of Hemingway. Hemingway's descriptions of Paris and of his writing process are often very beautifully written and fascinating. This book is a quick read, although it does not have much narrative (which is fine, but if you are expecting a plot, forget about it), and is somewhat disjointed."
3,A moveable feast,Well written review of the early years of Hemingway's life. A companion piece to A Paris Wife. Somewhat biased view of his relationships
5,One of the best!,So many good things have been said of this book and I can add nothing more. Anybody wanting to understand Hemingway and disciplined writing should read or reread this book.
3,its alright,the contents are very similiar to the 'paris wife' - not much new in this edition so i would not recommend it
1,REMOVEABLE FEAST,"Patrick Hemingway who holds the rights to this book has butchered the original which was meticulously compiled and edited by Hemingway's last wife, Mary Hemingway.Patrick (whom I met in Key West once at The Hemingway Days in the 1980's) has done his father a disservice by eliminating and re-writing parts of this book. I am thrilled to own a first edition of this book as it was intended in the early 60's shortly after Ernest's suicide.It seems this is a kind of Freudian attempt to slap his father in the face and capitalize on his memory. Shame on you Patrick. Write your own book.Both Charles Scribners and Maxwell Perkins, had they been alive, would have forbidden this manuscript being re-tooled in this manner. They are all turning in their graves. DON'T BUY INTO THE LIES."
3,Celebrity,"A great book for die-hard fans of Hemmingway, A Moveable Feast will disappoint many readers. For the average person, it would make more sense to read his famous novels first. While it is interesting to know what Paris was like between the Wars, and to read about some of the other famous people Hemmingway knew (Fitzgerald, Stein, Joyce, Elliot, Pound), it's not half as engaging as great novels like The Sun Also Rises, A Farewell to Arms, For Whom the Bell Tolls, or The Old Man and the Sea. So check those out first. And if you already have and are getting into the rest of his stuff, good for you, but I bet there is plenty of other ""rest of"" to get to ahead of this. Of course, if you are really into Paris, writers from the turn of the century, and/or dirty laundry, then feast away."
4,moveable feast........,"This book is an O.K. book I say. Hemingway is talking about how the atmospher in the small city Paris works for artist such as writer and painter. He is basically talking about his personal life and he uses a very straight and strong phrase. He shows all of his sides in this book: the good and the bad. Who can ever says, after reading this, there ain't no moveable feast in nowhere? I guess nobody."
2,Do Not Buy Kindle Edition of this Book!,"The Kindle edition of this great book is not worth a dime: almost ALL the illustrations are missing, at least in my copy, and the 2 that do appear, are hazy and smudgy, like poorly done mimeographed copies. Some chapter titles are mis-formatted: the two-sided text justification format is applied to the titles, resulting in ridiculous text placement. It is a shabby treatment of a great book. I do not believe I need to add anything to the many positive reviews of this immensely readable and enjoyable volume of (partly fictionalized) memoirs from Hemingway. But spend just a bit more and get the print edition, paper or hardback, of this work, please."
2,read sun also rises,"Guess what? A lot of people really like Hemingway. There are those who have never studied or even read another great author of the 20th century who has read Hem. This book was published after his death and I wonder if this wasn't something he wrote for his own kind of fun to attack and belittle everyone he knew in those years. Almost a practice writing exercise with malicious intent: read it carefully, F. Scott is famously viscously trashed but so is every single person he meets. My feeling is that if he was in his right mind - if you were to read anything about his last years he was in very bad shape - he would have destroyed this before he killed himself."
3,Not What I Expected,"From reading the back of the book I was expecting more details about Paris and his romance with his wife. I later found out (or I understand) that this book was published after his death from a collection of his papers and wasn't intended for a novel. Although its interesting to read about his daily acitivities, I would say that his other works (specifically, A Farewell to Arms) are better representations of Hemingway's talent."
4,Truly a Moveable Feast,"I find A Moveable Feast thoroughly enjoyable and probably even more so since it makes such a nice companion piece for The Paris Wife. It was very interesting to read about Hemmingway's Paris years as he remembered them later in life. Although I understand from the introduction that Hemmingway labored on this work and mercilessly cut and revised the different chapters, it still has much of the freshness and spare language that I enjoy from his earlier, completely fictional works. This memoir is a must read for Hemmingway fans, Francophiles and history buffs alike.On a side note, I appreciate the additional information and deleted chapters in this restored version. I think it is most important to read a work as the author originally intended (at least as close as we can get in a work published posthumously), but reading the extra material is interesting and does provide additional insight into the author and his life."
3,Paris as a place for Americans to meet each other,"It was a treat to read this book while on vacation in Paris. As a native of the city, I have walked many times down the rue du Cardinal Lemoine and passed by the Closerie des Lilas. Last month, I bought a book for my son at Hemingway's beloved Shakespeare and Company. Although no longer where Hemingway describes it, it still is a wonderful bookstore, which you can see in the opening scene of ""Before Sunset.""While these reminiscences of American authors and painters in Paris in the 1920s are fascinating, I can't help but regret the near total absence of the French in this book. Hemingway interacts with them as waiters or mechanics, but he seems to have had no contact with the French literary scene of the era, which included people like Andr√© Breton, Andr√© Gide and Jean Cocteau, as well as the recently rediscovered Irene N√©mirovsky. In this book, Paris is a set for Americans to interact with each other, not a place for cultural mingling."
4,Visit Paris and then read this book on the plane trip home..,"Only then can you capture the magic of this book. I can't imagine anyone ""getting"" this book unless they've been to the City of Lights, it will seem like much ado about nothing if read for any other purpose."
5,"Charming, Charming, Charming.","I was never a big Hemingway fan until I read 'The Sun Also Rises' for the second time in my thirties and was able to appreciate it. This book allows you to feel what he felt and live what he lived in Paris in his day. My heart nearly broke for him at the very end, because of the loveliness of his relationship with his first wife, Hadley. The ordinariness of their relationship, and the transcendence, are hard to hear in their simple truth.Hemingway says, ""When I saw my wife again standing by the tracks as the train came in by the piled logs at the station, I wished I had died before I ever loved anyone but her."""
5,all about life with an author,"again another great book. so young a man to have so much happen throughout those early years i am going into hospital on 13th march for a hip replacement operation and perhap i will buy a couple more of his books to take with me. thanks for a great selection of books. better than going to the library, and i get to keep the books mona S."
4,Insightful memoirs,Really enjoyed this personal bit of writing from Enerst's time in Paris. Really brought his experience and realtionships to life.
4,Living the good life,Hemingway's memoirs of his charmed years living the writer's life in Paris of the 1920's is filled with nostalgia for an era gone by (he actually put this book together decades later after the fact) and amusing anecdotes galore of well known literary figures of the era and locale. This book will make any fan of Hemingway long for days spent writing the hours away in cafes followed by a night filled with drinks and frolic.
5,Best,"I have used this product for years, and I think it is the best on the market. Works on all types of stains."
3,packaging/product different than picture,"I have been looking for the Zout spray with Oxy foam stain remover everywhere. The purple packing picture associated with this order is correct, however, upon receipt this is actual a red bottle with the a triple action formula, which does not have the oxy foam. Anyway, it works well - just not quite as well as the original in the purple bottle with oxy.This product does work though and better than others on the market, in my opinion. I ordered a box and all 12 bottles arrived in good condition and within time stated."
2,surprised,"I read this book and this reader thought it was very poorly written and hard to read. It went in circles and at times I was wondering what I had read and would go back and read it over and over, and most of the time I never did figure it out. I was surprised I expected this to be a good and well written book."
5,Sturdy Stool,"These stools appear well built with a decent rustic finish. The 24"" size is perfect for our standard countertop height bar. They are all solid hardwood of unknown type, looks like the ends of the legs are turned and pegged into the base, then mainly screwed together perhaps they used glue too. They came fully assembled. We have had them for a few months and they get a good bit of use with no real signs of issues or wear.Can't complain about any aspect of these, no shipping issues, went from the box to instant use, I did put some plastic slider feet on them later, and curved saddle seat is about as comfortable a shape as you get with a hardwood seat."
3,"Sturdy, but not solid coloration","Just received these. They seem sturdy and are a perfect height for my counter, pretty comfy sit. However, I was surprised that there is a rectangle of darker stain where any 2 pieces of wood meet. For example, there are 4 rectangles of darker stain on the seat, facing up, where the legs meet underneath. There are similar rectangles (smaller) on the legs where the cross-wood pieces meet. These are very visible and surprised me. If you look closely at the picture you can see them... I just didn't realize that they'd be so dominate."
4,Great Collection,"Wonderful collection, the solos and small ensembles are by far the best pieces on the album, but all are worth owning. Favorites are Colm Wilkinson - A Winter Boy, Michael Crawford - Let's Pretend and Frances Ruffelle -I Watch You Sleeping. When A Child is Born with Michael Ball is also wonderful. Worth the price. Truly enjoyable collection of holiday spirit."
5,A Modern Masterpiece.,"This is the most beautiful album I've ever heard. The songs on the album are so beautiful. You'll love this album. Also I recommend that you buy Janet Jackson's album the Velvet Rope because it is beautiful just like this album. I love the cover of the album. I wish that I was wear she was, she makes the place look so beautiful. My favorite songs on the album are The Comfort Zone, Running Back To You, Work To Do, You Gotta Go, Save The Best For Last, Just For Tonight, Better Off Now, and my favorite Goodbye."
5,Vanessa is way Better off now!,"I just finished with my review for Vanessa's first Cd ""The Right Stuff"" and plugged this one as her much more appealing album. I was very pleasantly surprised with this Cd from the beginning to the end. I love that there are several cool dance numbers, tract #1,2,and #10. I know that ""Save The Best For Last"" was the big hit, which I loved when it first hit the air waves(I remember waiting by the radio and listening to Hot 105.7 just to catch this sond to record it on tape!). However, this is the song I listen to least because there are so many other great songs on the Cd. Vanessa's voice sounds sooo much better here, and who cares if this Cd was as some would say ""over produced""(whatever that means anyway), it worked. Vanessa Williams' music stops at this Cd for me, why in the world did she not make another Cd like this one is frustrating."
4,Dynamic second album vocally and musically!,"Vanessa Williams' second album The Comfort Zone succeeds far better than her first. She had multiple hits like the classic ballad Save The Best For Last. The other hit ballad, Just For Tonight has a smooth slickness to it like shiny floor wax. Keith Thomas' glistening keyboards and production dominate most of her ballads. The uptempo tunes of Hairston and Gale, Phase 5, Rex Rideout and others are just as funky, especially the high energy hip-hop-inspired beats on Running Back To You. Liked her remake of the Isley Brothers' Work to Do. Save the Best has had a strong shelf life as it is still being played in drugstores and supermarkets. It has such a soothing, comforting feel to it.The Brian McKnight offerings are just as fabulous. This is such a dynamic album that did well on many formats in '91 and '92."
4,my fave by her,this is my favorite disc by Vanessa Williams very consistent.i like the duet with Brian Mcknight you got to go.running back to you is good as well.her vocals are solid thru out.she is very a solid talent.
3,SUCH A GREAT VOICE NEED BETTER MATERIAL,"You guys love every @#$% Album I've looked up. Are you pushing cds or reviewing music? You need to trthfully ask yourselves that, and give it a name.There's only two good songs on this entire cd."
1,Save the Best for Last?,If we're saving the best CD for last then this one goes first. Hold me back from ripping up the liner notes and breaking the disc in two. I have never heard such vocal diarrhea come out of my CD player. I got this CD for free... probably because it [is bad]. People are just giving them away left and right. Do you want a copy? Do you need a frizbee? How about a coaster for your beer? I have just the thing and I'll ship it to you in five days or less... oh wait... I already gave it to the little boy down the street who liked the dirty picture on the front.
5,insparational book,This is a wonderful book. One of my favorites I would recommend it to anyone. It will condemn evil and encourage you to go on with good courage.
4,Good Rendering,"For a free book, it is high quality, and have yet to find any mistakes, unlike many of the free Nook books as I have read. Well worth it."
4,Creatively presented truth,This book is a very intriguing work of art! It was hard to put down! It was also convicting to my walk with the Lord and the many ways in which I may complicate the simplicity of Faith in Christ Jesus. Enjoyed this writing.
5,Great!,Let this stir men ever to see their need of Christ! Praise the Lord for this blessing and real encouragement!
3,Good,"Good, a fine story of my life or yours. I saw my life in there sometimes, you might see yours as well. It really helps if you know the scriptures."
5,Pilgrims Progress--John Bunyan,"One of the greatest Christian books ever written and as a classic work of literature, a staple for anyone's library. All people of faith in Jesus Christ should read this book at least once in the original, and once in the easier, English version. And that's my rulin' (smile). Lots of wisdom and common sense within these pages, as Pilgrim travels down life's paths, making fallible choices from the many beguiling temptations, filled with snares and pitfals that befall him. The reader comes to see that the ""grass is not always greener on the other side of the fence,"" and ""decisions we make during our lives often come with a heavy price.""

5,Excellent price! Excellent service!,The book arrived and was actually better than the seller's description! Very timely in mailing it. I would buy from this seller again!
3,Great Book Badly Formatted,"This is a great book, a classic tale of the journey of faith that resonates with life every step of the way. I give the text of the book 5-stars, but the formatting of this particular version only 1-star--so I landed on averaging the two to give this 3 stars. This version was free for Kindle, but it's worth it to spend more for better formatting and ease of reading."
2,Meh,"I understand that this was an influential book in its time. Maybe it was so influential and its precepts adopted so fully by protestantism that it now seems commonplace and unremarkable. Whatever the deal is, it's difficult now to understand why it was so influential. The main points are uninteresting, the writing is not engaging in the slightest, and large sections of it can very charitably be called ""unenlightened"" (such as most of Part 2, which treats women as passive enjoyers of male protection/paternalism and compares Ethiopans to ""vile persons""). On the upside, it is an extremely quick read if you're used to all the ""thees,"" ""thous,"" and outdated spelling. Also, if you're interested in history and the historical squabbles within Christianity, this book will give you a pretty stark example of what the protestant mindset was in the late 17th century--the good and the bad."
2,COMPLICATED,TOO HARD TO FOLLOW IN SOME AREAS. THE IDEA IS A GOOD ONE BUT IT IS WRITTEN POORLY IN MY OPINION
1,Kindle Edition Not Correct,"This is for the kindle edition titled The Pilgrim's Progress from this world to that which is to come, delivered under the similtude of a dream. This only has half of the book. Christiana's entire story is left out of this edition."
2,Language Problems,"I thought the 400 year old language would be interesting, but I burned out on it pretty fast. I had to get a more modern version."
3,A journey,I gave this a three star. I should have read a better translation. It was hard to understand the old English style
5,Love it,Its just a must-read book.Everyone must have it in his/her library. Gives us all the different shades of our religious lifes.
3,Good book - but difficult language,"I read this book many years ago and what had struck me about it was how easy it was to follow and understand. I decided to get another copy since the one I read before had disintegrated.This is indeed the true script of the Pigrim's Progress with it's unabridged length and archaic language. It's fine to read if you have read other versions that are easier to understand but if this is your first time reading the Pilgrim's Progress, you will be spending half your time deciphering what you just read.Overall, still a good book but beware the prose of the book."
5,EXCELLENT BOOK,This book is awesome and a must read for the Christian to reinforce their faith and the walk on the narrow and straight journey as well as encouragement for the new seeker of Christ. Highly recommended.
5,the best,"the book arrived perfectly hardcover with not a spot of dirt, just a little damage that u can hardly see on the cover, but thats because i squinted my eyes and analized it closely.the book is marvelous, i love the story, i believe every christian can relate to this book.the language is easy to understand and at the back the author explains each chapter and wat it truely means. i havnt got to the end yet but so far this is one of my favorites. best story ever."
4,Read again after many years!,"Joh Bunyan's classic is worth reading a second time. It can be read quickly, skipping over the Biblical references, or slowly, checking each. Either way one is introduced to the thought of a man of deep faith, with a powerful writing skill."
4,"Book great, binding awful","This is an excellent edition of the Pilgrim's Progress. I would recommend it to anyone. BUT the pages were incorrectly bound and the book does not close properly - there is a definite ""wave"" to the pages and space between the pages and the covers when the book is closed. This has happened repeatedly with my orders - two from one account and one from another."
3,The best book available on the life of Gauss,Being an aficianado of the history of mathematics and science I did not hesitate to buy this book; and I would recommend it to anyone who loves stories about mathematicians. But it is much more of a (dry) 'unmathematical' biography than I expected. The author has done an amazing amount of research---the book is teeming with anectdotal stories about people related to Gauss and is filled with references to source material. This is certainly a book I enjoy 'having read' more than I enjoyed reading.
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,This has got to be one of the worst toys I ever got for my girls! The girl doesn't even fit correctly into the car and always falls out or her head pops off when trying to take her out. Bottom line is after a couple times playing with this my girls are done! The got to frustrated with it and it caused more tears then cheers!
1,tricked out of $5,This is the least durable toy I have ever purchased. The doll's head popped off no sooner than when my daughter took it out of the packaging. The glasses broke and it's a most useless toy even if it was made better. I want my $5 back!!!
3,"Some good, some ok","This compilation includes 29 stories (or plays). Of these, I felt the following were the best:The Privy CouncillorAn EncounterThe LetterThe KissAn Attack of NervesAnna on the NeckAt HomeThe book includes some of Chekhov's more obscure short stories - especially some of his early ones that I believe may be obscure for a reason. Some of Chekhov's most famous stories will not be found here. Still enough in here to be worth the read."
3,Great Tiny Little Mouse,"This is a great mouse for travel, but I wouldn't want to use it everyday. This is a two button optical mouse with a scroll wheel. The wheel does not work as a third button by pushing down on it as some other mice do. I use it on my tiny Sony Vaio PCGA-SRX99. It is perfect for my needs, but it is VERY small. I have small hands and the entire thing is only as long as my index finger. The buttons are quite noisy as well, so I tend to tap the finger pad on my computer to select something when I am using it in meetings. The case is a nice touch, so the cord doesn't get tangled when traveling. I only wish the cord were much shorter or retractable. It must be about three or four feet long and all I need is about 8 inches."
3,Certainly not Collin Mc'Raig!,"Not a bad game to pass the seedy early hours of the morning, but well Mc'Craig kicks this youngsters game!"
5,Cuttiest puppy,"This is a real loyal pup. He is well constructed, and looks like a Golden Retriever. He is the nice golden color. He has cute black eyes and black nose."
3,IOGEAR Hi-Speed USB 2.0 CardBus (GPU202),"Be sure you have reflected significantly before purchasing this product. The only things that I can use it for are my flash disks. And it speeds up the data transfer. For anything else, you MUST have the power adapter (which does not come with the cardbus).Even with the power adapter, this bus would not support a printer.Otherwise, it works fine."
1,Freezes Dell Inspiron 8100,"Did not work for me. I have a Dell Inspiron 8100, built in Q4 2001. When I insert the USB cable for an external disk (USB 2.0) the computer freezes. Unfreezes only when I eject the PC card. With some playing with the timing between powering-up the external disk and inserting the USB cable I sometimes can get the disk to communicate, but only at USB 1.1 bit rates. Tried loading the drivers from IOGear and made sure all my drivers were up to date (via MS Update). Had to use my internal USB 1.1 port to clone my disk."
5,Installed with no fuss,Purchased this for an older ThinkPad X30 running XP Pro. The card installed with no problems and works as expected.
1,Failed Quickly,"It worked for about 2 weeks on my Inspiron (XP), but then wouldn't be recognized. I tried downloading the driver from IO Gear, but no luck."
1,misleading and flawed,"After tinkering around with this product and trying almost everything recommended by tech support, it still does not perform at USB 2 speeds. I am trying to use an external CD-RW drive with this card. I have tested the drive on other computers that have USB2.0 ports and it works without any problems, but when I use it with this card I only get a speed of 7x when the drive should be working at 16x. Also, no where on this website does it mention an external power supply you might need, the only place it is mentioned is in small print on the installation manual. The power supply will set you back another 17 USD and is next to useless. Overall it is a very poorly designed product that needs more refinement."
2,GPU202 has problem with my Omnibook 6000,"The GPU2002 I bought doesn't work properly with my Omnibook 6000. The data in the external USB2 disk got lost. From the previous reviews, its performance seems to be a random thing, depending on the machine you have."
1,i am IOGear's complete lack of customer service,"causes system hangs 100% !!! of the time, when PLUGGING IN USB 2 devices like my ipod. 100% !!! support says ""we cannot replicate your problem""!!!this card is worthless; this company's response has been worthless; the time and trouble this thing has cost me LONG AGO blew away the $20-40 i saved not buying name brand.suffice to say i will never buy another IOGear product again."
2,Depends on your laptop model...,"I have a fujitsu E series laptop with Windows XP. The cardbus will only work with USB 1.1 peripherals.I bought an IOGEAR 2.5in USB 2.0 external hard drive enclosure and this hangs when connected via the card, sometimes spontaniously rebooting my pc.Writing to my new TDK USB 2.0 40x CDRW (via Roxio OR Easy CD Creator) also fails. Yes I've tried powering the cardbus (and the enclosure) to no avail. Iogear support was non responsive.Even after a clean install of XP (for other reasons) the problem with the ION persisted.Then tried the card with the same CDRW and Drive enclosure on my friends Dell Inspiron with XP - no problems!So you may be delighted or you may not."
4,A modest upgrade at low cost,I bought this card for my 18-month old Dell Inspiron 4000. I am running Windows 2000 Pro.Installing the card was very easy. Just plug it in and Windows will guide you to load the driver. You need at least Win 98 Second Edition to use this product.Works OK with all my older USB 1.1 devices. I don't have any USB 2.0 devices yet so I can't atest on the speed. I am looking forward to use it with an external CDRW soon. Their prices are quite reasonable now.The product is Hot-Swapable under Windows 2K. But you NEED to stop/remove before putting the system in standby/hibernate. Otherwise your system may behave erratically.Alex.
3,"Probably a fine product, but doesn't work with the iPhone on older mac hardware","FYI tried to use this product as a USB 2.0 port for a Mac Powerbook G4 running Leopard (10.5). The card worked fine for keyboards, mice, and ipod syncing, but it did not work for iPhone syncing. It would frequently cause kernel panics and require manual powercycling to reboot the mac.I tried a few different ways to get it to work (including using the drivers built-in to Leopard and then using the latest 2003 drivers from the iogear website), but ultimately was forced to give up.Note that I also tried a Belkin product and was similarly unsuccessful."
1,Don't waste your cash - you have this book already.,"This book is a paperback version - word for word - of the on-line documentation for VID6. They've just removed the active links that make the on-line stuff reasonably useful. That's why most reviewers found it too condensed - the internal links are gone. So if you own InterDev, you have this book already. If you don't, why do you want to buy a book on it? I'm new to InterDev, and could use a good book to help me out - I find the interface confusing at best. But this book is certainly not the one I need. Fortunately, the guy in the next cube knows his way around..."
2,"not so deep, not one full sample application","I have used and still using this book, but I am also in the process of looking at other books, because I could not find what I was looking for. I need to apply security to my database application, but this issue is not mentioned in database concepts at all over the internet. Differences between JScript and VBScript are not covered in detail. Besides book is shallow on uses of components displayed on the left side of the program (default setting). Some features that are mentioned can be figured out just by clicking here and there."
1,Not Much Help,"The first time I saw VID 6 was at the customer's site. I huried to the bookstore and bought the only book written on VID 6. It was like throwing a drowning man an anchor! Between this book, the MSDN Library CD, and Microsoft's ever-so-helpful online documentation, I got most of my answers from trial and error. The book is repetative and does not touch on any technical issues. It is also a very poor reference book."
1,It is a print-out of MSDN Library for Visual Studio 6.0,"If you have MSDN Library for Visual Studio 6.0, you don't need buy it. This book is just a print-out for MSDN Library. MSDN Library is free. The web copy is updated very often."
1,Go with Sam's,"I've opened this book with Visual Interdev 6 questions, and I've returned it to my bookshelf unsuccessful a number of times. It's difficult to identify what the author was trying to accomplish in writing this, but it sure wasn't to convey information about MS Visual Interdev 6.0 to others. Stick with the Sam's publications, and hopefully some day the Microsoft press will come around."
2,Microsoft . . . as usual,"This 480 page book starts talking to people interested in internet development on page 283. Before this point it's a review of Visual Interdev that prospective 6.0 buyers won't understand, and current 6.0 owners already understand. After this point, the book gives a fairly good discussion of script writing and script application. At $20 bucks this book is probably worth having, but it won't be the core of anyone's internet development library."
2,Good for general InterDev knowledge but does not go more.,"I was hoping to find some in-depth matter which is not available in the on-line help but I did not find much to what I already knew. Instead of ""programmer guide"", more appropriate term for the title is ""users guide"". Particularly lacking is details of ASP and integerating data bases using queries etc. Good for general information but not of much practical value."
3,handy,"Indeed, this is not the right book for programming with Interdev 6.0. However, I always kept it on my desk as a quick guide to the Interdev IDE. In this context I find it useful.I got most of the programming aspects from the MSDN Library.I really learned the core programming from the AppDev training books which my employer was willing to invest in but if you don't have a big budget then there are lots of resources on the internet."
5,the writing of chuck level is a thing of beauty,"The writing of Chuck Leavel combined with the talents of the band members makes this one of the best jazz/crossover groups of all time, from sounding like the Allman Brothers for 16 bars than drifting back into Chuck's intricate jazz melodies is a thing of beauty, if you like melodies over melodies played with prescision and beauty this is the band for you."
2,Not the original recordings!!!!,"What a rip. 1990's era versions of 1960's/'70's Caravan songs? You gotta be kidding me!The recordings are actually quite pleasant- hence the 2nd star, but pleasant is not everything and it is not at all what I was expecting, and I don't think I'll ever listen to this again after the first run through. Authentic originals cannot be replaced.Buy the original albums instead."
1,Over priced and poorly edited,"I'm using this book as a text for a local class in financial planning math. The book has many typos and inconsistencies. Some look to be careless editing between the first and second edition. There are also major inconsistencies between chapters, which are prepared by different individuals. For example, the first chapter gives instructions for several calculators, including the HP-12c, which our class focuses on. Later chapters use different calculators. There are typos and errors in some of the problems.The book doesn't have a glossary or index."
5,jfroggin,"I bought this for my grandchildren, 12 and 8. I disagree that it is too advanced for an 8 year old. Just because she may not know the answer the first time 'round, she's learning quickly. And my 12 year old has a lot of fun playing the game, probably because he's hoping to get the 6 bones first. I'm hoping more question cards are available."
3,disappointed,"I didn't think these were very effective, and were not easy to work with. I doubt I'll try them again."
2,Wouldn't buy again.,Basically I decided these were a waste of money. I had some trouble putting them on and then they didn't last very long. Covering the couch I didn't want scratched up works better.
3,"Not bad, could be better","Bought these to deter our cat from scratching carpeted stairs.They work OK, and certainly deter him, but they are not ""invisible"". You definitely notice them as it looks like you've put a large piece of double-sided tape on whatever they are placed on.However, they do work, are easy to apply, and also don't seem to leave any distinguishable markings on fabric when removed."
2,"Great idea, but didn't stick to the couch fabric","I think this is a great idea, but the sheet did not stick to the couch fabric at all. I wasted about 3 sheets before I could even get it halfway on, and then when I walked by and accidentally brushed my towel against the sheet, it peeled right off. I'm going to have to try something else."
1,The darn things don't stick to furniture,"I use the Sticky Paws rolls of tape which are great so I figured these sheet versions would be easier. I don't know if I got a bad batch or what but they don't stick to a darn piece of upholstered furniture. Waste of money, I'm sticking to the Sticky Tape rolls."
1,Awful,"I don't know if we got a defective batch or what, but we seriously couldn't get the backing off of the sticky sheets.No, we're not idiots, these just sucked.....a lot.Find something else."
4,Kitty does not like,"I've used both the regular and XL strips with good results. My 2 cats only scratch when I'm not around so this is a good option. The only problem I've found is 1 cat just scratches right next to wherever the strips are. The fix is to put the strips not just on the couch corners but all along exposed areas. At $10-15 bucks for a package it's a little spendy for what you actually get.They stick and remove fine on cloth furniture. Be careful with leather though; my couch has no problems but a chair now has large, rectangular, lighter areas where the strips are routinely used. Not many other options out there though."
1,Didn't work for my cat,"My cat touched the sticky paper and then proceeded to pull it off the furniture with his teeth. He was actually more attracted to the area because he wanted to play with the sticky paper. He is only 2 years old, so maybe this works with older cats, but definitely not with my little brat.I would also suggest the manufacturer come up with a different material on the outside of the paper. It is just as sticky as the side applied to the furniture and catches cat hair every time the cat walks by."
2,don't like these,I don't like these sheets. They are very thin and wrinkle up easily. The 'SmartyKat' brand from Target works much better. It's thicker and stays on without wrinkling.
3,One of my cats likes these apparently!,"I bought these sheets as a precaution to cover areas of my carpeting underneath corner furniture in my kittens' room, so that they would not have any ""accidents"" on the carpet.Well, these sheets stuck onto the carpet and have been in place for six weeks and still retain their stickiness. I have even seen a small collection of balls and cat toys stuck to the sticky sheets over the weeks, but I can not say for sure whether they could be credited with deterring my kittens from using those areas instead of their litter boxes, especially since I just observed one of them half seated on one of the sticky sheets and licking it! I just removed them!"
5,works great!,We bought a new sofa; our cats scratched up the last one so we decided to try these. The cats haven't scratched the sofa since!
3,Not for the faint at heart,"I read the reviews on this product and felt skeptical that so many people had such a difficult time placing the tape. Then my roommate tried to apply it and experienced every complication that others had. However, when I placed the product down I had no trouble. Yes, it can and will double back on itself if you're not careful. But placing it on the rug, smoothing it down, and then lifting the top protecting sheet prevented most problems. I held down the corner of the sticky tape as I removed the paper, pulling the paper at a 45 degree angle instead of straight up, and the entire sheet laid smooth. If I had it to do over again, I'd just buy double sided tape."
4,They worked for me,"These worked great for me. The first time that my cat went to claw after I had put them on, he put his paws up on the chair and immediately removed them and looked at his paws like there was something wrong with his paws! Then he sniffed the sticky pads, apparently decided they were the culprit, not his paws, and turned and walked away. No clawing attempts since. The only thing negative I can say is that since my dogs are about the same height as the sticky pads, the pads have collected some hair, so they're not exactly an attractive addition to my leather furniture, but neither were the claw marks. And once they get too hairy, I'll just put some new ones on."
1,Not very helpful at all,"My cat recently started pawing at my couch. Before it turned into a habit of scratching, I purchased these strips. I thought that these would be better than the tape since I had very large areas of fabric to cover. The sheets barely adhered to the couch's upholstery. Half of them bunched up or pealed off immediately. Within two days they all had peeled off of the couch. What a waste of money."
3,Does work well for larger areas,"While I prefer the plain roll of sticky tape, this did work well for a larger floor area I needed to cover, without having to unroll a ton of tape to do it. This worked for its purpose, in this case. That said, I prefer the simple roll of sticky paws to using this as it's cheaper and in most cases, easier. It's not that easy to work with the larger piece of tape. I just needed to completely cover a larger area of floor and decided to try it."
2,Product as described,"Nothing against this product it is exactly as described... unfortunatley my cat does not seem to mind... although I know this method is effective for other so worth a try perhaps your cat will be more ""compliant""...lol"
4,Works Great!,"My cat has a terrible habit of scratching the corners of our couch. I really just put up with it for years - then I heard of double sided tape! I found this product and the sheets are great - so far it is working fine, I am ordering more because i have a sectional and the first piece I messed up putting it on, so I ruined the whole piece. I would recommend this product!"
5,Great scratching deterent...,"This is the only thing I've found that actually keeps my cat from scratching my furniture. It can make actually using the furniture a little awkward, but at least it doesn't get torn up!"
4,Really Good!,"I didn't know much about N.E.R.D. except that it was more-or-less a side project for The Neptunes.I saw this CD at a good price and figured, why not. I am a big fan of Neptunes beats, but don't expect the same sonics if you pick up N.E.R.D. - the sound is totally different and totally awesome. There is a great retro feel on this one, nothing over done however and mostly guitars as opposed to just beats.My favourite tracks are: ""Fly Or Die"", ""Jump"", ""Backseat Love"", ""She Wants To Move"" and ""Chariot Of Fire"".Worth checking out."
3,It's Aight,"I loved ""In Search of..."" . Fly or Die is good but doesn't have that Stevie Wonder soul to it like the first one. Granted still good but not as catchy.But.... the first one took awhile to grow on me. Just buy it! You'll eventually be spinning this nonstop."
5,NERD is the best band in years!,"The thing about NERD is that they aren't afraid to take chances. They do what they do best and if you like it or not, it's up to you.Anyways, their last album ""In Search Of"" was one of the best albums of all time in my opinion. So, I was definitely excited to hear that they were coming out with a new album.Wow! When I first heard this album I said to myself, ""They did it again!"" This is way awesome and is a good alternative to all the crappy music they have out their now.This, this is what music is all about! This is the best of the best! All the songs are amazing, their's no one greater than the other! THIS IS A MUST BUY!"
2,For those Artsy hippy people,"I usually love NEPTUNE tracks..but NERD things....nah (yes folks, they are two different things). I bought this cause I wanted a hip hop album but it tends to sounds very 60s-70s era rock. This isn't really for my Hoods, club heads, and breaks. ""She Wants to move"" is tight but thats it. If you're all artistic and S@&#, you'll love it..."
4,New hotness,"Although lacking the instrumental backing of Spymob on their second album, N.E.R.D. still manages to create a memorable album. N.E.R.D. again has a wide range of subject matter, with many of the songs taking on completely different personas. The album has more of a techno feel than the first album, with Maybe and The Way She Moves being two of the standout tracks. Lenny Kravitz and ?uestlove (from the Roots) play the guitar and drumbs on Maybe, and two of the singers from Good Charlotte lend their vocal talent on Jump. Get this album, it has lots of catchy tunes."
4,Fly or Die,"in short this cd is great a true piece of good music just as in search of is... i reckonmend this as well!two amazing CD's but a great band and production company!the prue grooves of ""i like the way she dance"" is so fly and ""drill sargent"" is brillaint also and if you like ""she wants to move"" you'll love it but if you dont then give it a chnace you'll prob love it to!go get it ya'll!"
3,ILL BE SUCCINCT,"There is no comparison to ....In Search Of.......this album doenst have the groove and diversity that did.Fly or Die is good and its a great chillin disc...pop it in a relax, then pop in ....In Search of.....and take off!"
2,Do yourself a favor ...,"... Don't buy this album. It opens with ""Don't Worry About It,"" an excellent track reminiscent of N*E*R*D's past thumping hits ""Lap Dance"" and ""Truth or Dare"" ---- but it just goes downhill from there. The big single released off this album, ""She Wants to Move,"" is just terrible, and the rest of the album is downright corny. There is one good hidden track attached to the end of ""Chariot of Fire,"" but it falls far short of justifying the rest of the CD. Your time is better spent visiting a (legal) filesharing Web site and downloading a few tracks. That's much cheaper than shelling out the sixteen bucks for this horribly weak album."
1,Borderline Wack....,"No forget that, to me this album is dog poo. The first NERD album In Search Of was 1000 times better than this trash. I can't find a single song that I could listen to repeatedly. This album is very heavy on the rock side and that may be why I don't like it. Plus Pharrell sings way too much on itwith his school boy choir voice. It doesn't blend smoothly over the beats like it did on the last album in my opinion. So the album may not be 'wack', but it just isn't my cup of tea. 1 star."
4,"Finally, but you coulda came better!","This was a good record from N.E.R.D. I think the last was better and that it was a more cohesive effort. That's kinda unfair to say being that the last was recorded electronically before they remade it with a band. But this is still a great album and shows that the Neptunes are more than hitmakers. They have broad musical imaginations as well. The highlight of the album has got to be ""Maybe"". The drum cadence, provided by Questlove of the Roots, and the addictive guitar licks, by Lenny Kravitz, add to a simple yet hypnotic groove that the album should have followed. I think the next album will be their zenith, but until then Fly Or Die is a record to grow on you. One last question though....what the hell does Shay do?"
3,Flying....Not Soaring,"I'm a huge fan of NERD and after purchasing 'In Search Of' (Faboo Album Indeed!) i thought this album would be much better..I was wrong! However, it wasn't a disappointing wrong, as this album, I must stress, is very pleasing to the ears. Its more rocky, than hip-hop-py if you compare it to 'In Search of'. Regardless, It's a good album, but lacks a little something....Best Songs:*Don't Worry About It*She Wants to Move*Wonderful Place*Maybe*The Way She Dances"
5,Something Different,"This is the best CD I bought since ""College Dropout"" this cd is very different but very good. I suggest that everyone that reads this review, buy the CD and see if it's your style of music. I gave this CD five stars because I have yet to skip a track on this CD."
3,average.................,"i loved their first album ""in search of"" but this one just never really clicked with me. i guess u can give it a try but dont expect too much. Best song on the album is most def ""She wants to move"" and the madden bros from good charlotte are on the track ""jump"""
5,Must have,"I've been a huge N.E.R.D. fan ever since In search Of was first released. Until recently, I've had IN search of in my cd player for months. Now I have a replacement. Fly or Die is such a great album. It's so different. The guys really got creative on this one. But I have to be honest, only a a selected bunch will fully appreciate Fly or die's sound. Every track is amazing!!The coolest part is there are 3 bonus hidden tracks!!!!I absolutely love this cd, and I salute N.E.R.D. for their creativity and open minds.N.E.R.D. can't be pigeonholed in one genre, they cover so many. That's what's so cool about them.You should definitely get this cd if you have an open mind and love feel good tunes."
4,The fellas are back...,"I first heard ""Provider"" in the summer of 2002 @ Borders here in DC. I immediately picked up a copy of In Search Of..., and it has been in rotation since for the last two years. So when I heard about Fly or Die, I knew this CD would also be a welcomed addition to my collection. N.E.R.D., did not let me down. The album is different from their debut, as Spymob is not providing the live instrumentation, yet merits props for trying something new. Like In Search Of... I think I have found something to like about every track on the album. I would recommend this project to anyone who enjoyed the debut, and would like to experience the boys with a new sound."
1,"Wow, this is awful","I usually don't post reviews on Amazon, but I feel it morally necessary to warn people about this piece of junk.In Search of ... was one of the better albums of the 2000s, but with Fly or Die, N.E.R.D. must have decided to expand their musical scope. Only problem is, they forgot what they were good at: experimentation in the pop realm.There really is nothing good about this. This isn't rock, it's just noise. Song structure, focus, harmony ... all MIA.I can only assume people want to feel cool to like N.E.R.D., so they recommend this. In reality, this CD will be filling up the racks at the used CD store in the very near future. Don't even buy it there."
3,Sorry baby but I don't see any future between us.,"I think that most of the pepole here will agree with me that the first album ""In the Search of..."" was an amazing and fresh album.This one is not.Why? Maybe because we were expacting something even better then the first one. Maybe because we used to the simple but funky lyrics and beats from the first album.Maybe because N*E*R*D* was trying to do something new and different.I don't know, But I know one thing, This is only a medium album and I would be very suprised if I would be listening to it next month.BABY! buy the first album!"
3,Fly or Die? Somewhere in the middle,"Now I've been a pretty big Neptunes/NERD fan since they produced ""Lookin at me"" for Mase. And In Search of.... is one of my favorite cd's and is also the main reason why I'm disappointed in Fly or Die. Don't get me wrong, it still has that unique NERD flavor, but it doesn't seem to take off like the last album did. Just not as dynamic. You dont feel that same force. And I wish they would have had some more people featured like Kelis or somebody. This joint is basically Pharell's solo album.All in all, I would give this cd a 3.5 mainly cuz you have to compare it to their last cd which was just flat out better, but Fly or Die is definitely a good cd to have."
2,"This is N.E.R.D, not the Neptunes!","I'm gonna break this CD down short and simple. In Search of... was N.E.R.D first album, it was on the alternative tip, but had an hip hop edge. Neptunes album was straight up hip hop. This new album is all alternative. It is a cool cd, but I'm a hip hop head. I bought this expecting the Neptunes, but I forgot this is a whole nother form of them. So when I heard all these guitars and hard drum kicks, I'm like what the hell is this. If you have an open mind then cop this, if your a hip hop head like me than run from this! But on the low I'm kinda feelin that She wants to Move joint! Holla at cha boy!"
2,Is this the best they could do?,"Wow, usually im one of the biggest NERD fans there is, but this cd doesn't even resemble there past work at all. Something went toattally Wrong on this CD, and there lyrics arent felt.. and the beats sure arent the same. This sounds more like a BAD jAZZ album. I was hoping for better"
4,"Great album, great music","People not have heared of N.E.R.D. have probably slept for a long long time since these guys have totally taken over the music industry. They produce songs for almost every top pop/hiphop artist like Justin, Jay-Z, Bustha Rhymez and many more... This is their second album following ""In Search Of"". In Search Of had some great songs, like provider, run to the sun and more. With their new album they seem to go further. It is great, relaxed and a really NERD style of music, a mix of pop, rock and hiphop. And the lyrics are simply great and real.. You can listen to these songs in a happy mood, and almost anywhere around. Except dont expect the Neptunes beats... I would definately recommend this album to anyone who liked their first album and also as a try-out for people not have heard of them yet... It is great and you will probably like it!"
2,just ok&that's Being Kind,Chad&Pharell have had there say on the Chart&whatnot for some time now&on this Album like with alot of there stuff things begin to way down.they have Talent but they are wearing out there Musical Welcome.nothing happeing as far as Lyrics&the vocals&flow are not working.
2,Where's the beats?,"I'm not totally familiar with NERD. I bought the ""in search of"" album but the only tracks I listened to were ""lap dance"" and ""rock star."" Anyway, I listened to this and this CD was all mellow crap IMO. Ya, it'd be good music to have playing while you're doing something else maybe, as some background sounds. But as far as rap or rock go, it's just way too mellow. I tried to listen to it expecting good but it just wasn't good. Maybe my mom would like it."
2,They would never give these songs to their top 40 artists,"I just can't listen to this and not think of how good their first album was. The biggest thing this album is missing is rapping (that third guy goes unnoticed the whole album). While I completely respect when rap artists are experimental or do more singinf (Cee Lo Green, Andre 3000,) it does not work here. The greatest part about the first album was their backing band Spymob, which gave the album a great live feel. Williams and Hugo play on every track, but it lacks the same intensity and ingenuity of the first album.This entire album seems to be N.E.R.D., specifically Williams, trying to compete with Kanye West. And just to prove how non-rap this album is, there is a cameo by Good Charlotte's Madden brothers.I am a huge NERD fan and was really excited for this album to come out. I would have given it 1 star, but ""Breakout"" and ""Wonderful Place"" are pretty solid."
1,Good Charlotte !?!?!,"OK, the Neptunes are possibly the best hip hop / pop producers out there, so why are they making a rock album? This is trash. Pharrell, if you are reading this, stick to rap and pop, what are you thinking doing a collaboration with GOOD CHARLOTTE?! This album is ridiculous. Neptunes stick to producing hot rap and pop beats, and cut out this crappy rock stuff."
5,so so fly,N.e.r.d's fly or die was soopafly I definetly reccomended it. Although the Neptunes are yet to recieve the credit they deserve for the music they create. This album puts them in the limelight. The album is tight if you like rock hip-hop soul or rnb. I especially like maybe and thrasher and she likes to move also is cool.
3,dissapointed,"First off, I'm not saying this album is bad, it's not. I was a big fan of their first album and was real excited when this came out. However, I was really dissapointed. They seem to have basically, gone soft. Musically, they've matured quite a bit, but that sense excitement and energy is gone. This is a much more mellow album, with no guest rappers. I'm not saying you need a rapper to make the songs good, in fact songs like Bobby James and Brain were some of my favorite songs off In Search Of... I find this is a good album, but only if I listen to it once every couple months. A lot of the songs sound very similar to each other and it gets old. Just don't expect the same stuff you heard on their last album.tranks to check out:JumpBackseat LoveShe Wants To Move"
3,Eh,The CD is alright. Some songs are good like 1. Don't Worry About It 5. She Wants To Move 6. Breakout 9. Thrasher 12. Chariot Of Fire The rest are Ok not the best. But it does have some cool beats. And they are playing there own instruments that is wat made it better. In my opinion the last cd was better.
5,surprisingly good,"I heard these guys on Saturday Night Live and I was blown away. Got the CD today and it is awesome. Their music is hard to pidgeon hole, but I'll try. Jazzy rap with a strong Zappa influence. Can't stop listening to it."
4,N.E.R.D throws em' a curve ball.....,"It may that I've been out of the Neptunes/NERD loop for awhile but this is not the album I was expecting. And thats OK. On one hand I give total props to NERD for trying something different from their last release. This album is almost 98 percent free of any refernce to hip hop whatsoever. And almost completely free of any drum machine sounds that the Neptunes are so known for. I guess they decided to separate the two personas completely. Though honestly its sound almost exactly like a Steely Dan album. And I do mean ""almost exactly"".Take Steely Dan, mix it with Bens fold five and add alittle skater punk attitude, and you've got the NEW Fly or Die album by N.E.R.d."
4,This album... it's SEXY!,"After In Search Of..., N.E.R.D. became one of my favorite groups. Their mix of hip hop and rock, alternative, whatever you want to call it, made them one of the most unique groups of the time. Now they are back with their second offering, and how else do I put it... amazing? Sensational? Sexy?Don't Worry About It is one of the best on the album, and a great opener. They seem to be leaning more towards the rock instead of the hip hop on this one, hence the lack of Clipse cameos. The album flows very well, and each song complements the next.Other songs to look out for: Wonderful Place, She Wants To Move, and The Way She Dances! Beat it!If you liked the first one, definitely scoop the second. Better than the first? I'll leave it up to you, Lucien.And the Good Charlotte guest spots... don't sweat it, it ain't that bad...."
3,Disappointed,"I was expecting more innovative hip-hop from these lads. ""In Search of"" exposed the obvious talent of this group, but they really lose their identity here. If N.E.R.D. is trying to fall into the footsteps of Fishbone, they do a very poor job. The music lacks innovation and is rather simple, and they should cease with the Mom & Dad lyrics already. They're grown men now. I hope they find what they are looking for and share it with the rest of us on their next release. Three stars for effort."
1,don't buy this garbage,"I love the neptunes, but this cd [***]. Compared to there last cd's huge hits Lap dance and Rock Star, it takes not just one step back, but prolly 10. I don't think i have ever been as disappointed in a cd as this. I have been looking forward to this for over a year and it has already been sold back after purchasing it yesterday! The best song is definately She wants to move. Im hoping this is a joke and they are gonna release the real new cd shortly! Thats wishful thinking though. Might as well just download the hit single and maybe number 1 on the album and save yourself the money on paying for the whole thing."
3,"Good, but not normal N-E-R-D","This CD as a whole is pretty good, and runs right up there with the normal Neptunes produced artists, but in comparison to ""In Search Of..."" it falls short. To quickly sum up this review, if you like songs such as ""Change Clothes"" and more recent ""Pharrell"" sounding songs as I'd ike to call them, then you will probably love this CD, if you are looking for an original groupd, as heard on ""In Search Of..."" this may not be for you. This is a good Neptunes CD, not as good as ""Clones"", but still good, but nothing like ""In Search Of..."""
2,Not Worth the Money,"I just bought the new N.E.R.D album and was greatly disappointed. There are only about two songs on the whole album that are half-way decent. This might be one of those albums that you have to listen to a few times before you enjoy, but I'm not going to waste my time -- in the mean time, I have to figure out a way to return this CD."
5,"""#1 Trakie""","LET SEE TO BE HONEST....I LOVE NERD!! I HAVE NEVER BEEN THE TYPE TO BUY CD'S OR EVEN GET ALL WILD OVER A MUSIC GROUP. ONCE I SEEN THESE BOYZ IN CONCERT, I WAS IN AWW OF THEIR MUSIC. I BOUGHT THE CD AND HAVENT BEEN ABLE TO TAKE IT OUT OF MY RADIO, SINCE. I TRULY RECOMMEND THIS CD TO ANYONE WHO IS WITH DOUBT!!"
4,Feel Good Music w/a Message,"N.E.R.D.'s new cd Fly or Die is an excellent and extremely creative work of art. I love the fact that all of the songs are meaningful (i.e Drill Sergeant)because it's so rare to find that type of music today. Aslo, the interludes are very interesting, especially the one that follows my fav song Wonderful Place. Every single last track on the cd is very catchy and in general, the cd just puts me in a good mood :)."
1,terrible,this album was horrible. the only good songs on it were fly or die and she wants to move. if u ever needed a reason to burn a cd this is it. i'll be crushing this fly or die cd i wasted my money on now.
2,"NO, NO, NO","What the #@&% is this garbage? I usually like NERD and the neptunes, but this is way out there, and not in a good way. All the songs sound the same. The one good song (Thrasher) is only two minutes long. They should just stick to producing others albums."
1,garbage! not worth the 76 cents i paid at allofmp3,i couldnt find a single song that i enjoyed or could listen to fully!!! f#ck these @ssholes for putting out such garbage on their own album while they make hits on everyone else's
2,The world is about to fee.....,"the world is about to feel something they have never felt before,ever sence that track came out MC's turned into robot's these beats that producers make inquire no talent what so ever to make a hot song over,all u gotta do is take a bunch of catchy phrases that 16 yr old highschool sl*ts can put in their aim away messages and your golden.no sign of monotone what so ever warped voices and fake MC's everywhere.hey usher ""can you handle it"" ever see that comm.? ""no err body in the club git tipsy"" my mans 17! he just got the right to peep rated R movies,pharell went from a trucker hat wearin cool dude makin hot nore beats on the low still bankin dough and keepin it real to straight up just ""frontin"".....hook me up with some gangstarr,big L,and icp (MCL) and get me back to reality cause lil eastside boys and jonny are yelling to much"
2,Is everyone taking crazy pills 'cept me?,"It is really sad when reputation makes up for horrible sounding music. Regardless of what great success the Neptunes have come across in the past, this confusing and ridiculous album shouldn't be getting any radio play or good press. I commend the guys for trying to do something original, but their effort was simply a good try. Some of the grooves on here have glimpses of subtle coolness, but Pharrell's voice and songwriting can distract. Lyrics such as, ""Her A@$ is a spaceship I wanna ridddeee"" (on single She Wants To Move) made me laugh out loud. Even with the lyrics being so corny, I recognize skills. The beats on ""Breakout"" and ""Thrasher"" are pretty dope. 2 cool songs out of 12 songs is not out of the ordinary in this day and age. The collabo with makeup artists Good Charlotte is silly. For any proof listen to the DFA remix of ""She Wants To Move."" It is so many times more interesting than the N.E.R.D. original."
4,Really good flow to this album,Not as good as In Search Of...but much improved flow and has a consistently good vibe.
3,The structures of empires from Greece to present.,"For such a difficult subject, Pagden does a good job of creating a readable book detailing the rise and fall of European Empires. From Alexander the Great, and the Roman Empire to the decline of the British Empire, Pagden details the rise of these empires and why they fell. In the end, it was the weakness of the colonizers along with the rise of nationalism which spurred the end of all empires. Pagden also details that some of the early empires were not racially divided, but with the rise of science and some of the new European nation states, racism along with slavery reared its ugly head. Commerce and the search for raw materials spurred on the exploitation of these colonies, and reduced the natives to subject status.This is a nice theory book about why empires came about. It gives a lot of information in a few short pages."
3,Mocha Splenda Sweetener,"Not as sweet as I expected, but still has a good flavour, Will only dissolve well if your beverage is VERY hot!! Maybe buy again."
5,"Nice flavor, finally","At first I just put one of these into my large cup of coffee, and the flavor was just not noteworthy. Then I put in two of them, and really liked the chocolate kick. I do recommend these for a touch of variety in your coffee. Good with creamer, too."
5,Great stuff,I fell in love with Splenda's mocha flavor when it first came into stores. For the past year I haven't been able to find it and I am so excited that I can get it from you. Thanks for carrying my favorite coffee flavoring.
2,Not What I Expected,"I was very disappointed in the taste of this item. Not at all what I expected from Splenda. It is much too overpowering, strong and when added to your beverage, that is all you can taste. For instance, if added to coffee, you will not detect ANY coffee flavor, only the Splenda flavor. Much too strong. I prefer the subtle taste of the other coffee additives over this Splenda product - without question!!"
5,"I have to agree with other, WAAAY UNDERRATED!!!","I bought this CD for 1 cent because I heard a friend tell me that I needed to pick it up. I was plesantly surprised! I really got into it, and im sure after you sample the album 2-3 times you will find yourself hooked. Its far removed from the BS kinda Good Charolette emo kinda stuff thats popular now, but to me thats definatley a good thing. Its a shame that this band didnt stick around longer for us to get a more objective view of their full portfolio, but such is the music buisness i suppose. For a newbie rocker hit up tracks 5 and 6 first. ""Skydiver"" and ""big big city"". If you were at all into the mid 1900's kinda thrash rock with alot of melody then schtum is definatley for you."
5,In the wake of nirvana-schtum !!!,"In the mid-nineties the music biz offered us the Backstreet Boys after Kurdt's demise. There was so much talentand excellent music available that that act alone almost robbed us all of gems like Schtum. I lost two copies ofGROW to friends, now I've got one for me. ""Big big city"" and ""Skydiver"" are great, I enjoy the brit-grunge biteof the whole cd. When I roam through used stacks now I find myself always pleased with '95 to '97 titles, just as Idid reviewing promos as a buyer. So many missed monsters ! If you enjoy Schtum check out Scheer and My Sisters Machine ""Diva""."
5,BUMPIN,"I've always loved GOGO but this one here will make you grandmother bounce, will definately make the party rock.Have to get it, you won't regret it"
5,~I LOVE this CD!~,The Charming Factor is an absolute delight! I love almost every song on this CD (which is rare). I'm a recent fan of Blind Faith and Envy. I purchased all of their CD's after discovering them on myspace.Golden Glass is one of my favorites on this CD. I love that song! I'm looking forward to what this group will come out with next.
3,Bias'd Book,"if you hate communism or Karl Marx this book is for you, I have read some other works by Marx and Engels and I felt this book was showing what the past of Marx and Engels lived like and trying to downgrade a movement. I would recommend this book to anyone because you do need to read both sides of a view point"

1,don't waste your money,"I endured watching maybe 10 minutes of this crappy movie, deleted it from library and wished I could get my money back. There is no story as far as I can tell, the subtitles go by too fast to keep up with the dialogue but the special effects are neat.Other than the special effects the movie has nothing going for it.Strongly recommend you rent the movie before buying it, that would have saved me $13 dollars."
2,cheese ball central,"if you like a bunch of men in make up, bad wigs, super cheesy effects, lots of evil grimacing, paper machet chains breaking, and whirling, twirling retardedness with no feasible relation to actual (or even legendary) martial combat....and you are into b-grade chinese crap, then this buds for you. weakness. nowhere near the level of crouching tiger hidden dragon, hero, house of flying daggers."
1,AMAZON BLEW THIS . THE MOVIE IS ALL RIGHT,I give the move a 4 I GIVE AMAZON A 1 FOR NOT SAYING IT WAS NOT IN ENGLISH I DONT WANT TO WATCH MOVIES THAT ARE NOT IN ENGLISH YOU JUST WASTED MY MONEY .YOU NEED TO PUT THIS IN THE DETAILS OR IS THATS WHY YOU DO IT TO GET PEOPLE TO RENT THEM . IF I KNOW IT IS NOT IN ENGLISH I DONT RENT THEM AND ALOT OF OTHER TO . SO DO US ALL A FAVOR TELL US
2,Not as good as the 1st movie Storm Riders,"Storm Riders or Wind & Cloud, the first movie was much better. Although the visuals are quite beautiful and grand in this one, it was definitely trying to blatantly imitate 300 (as mentioned by other readers) to the extent where it became distracting and quite frankly, annoying.Overall, the sequel does not live up to the great 1st film, and falls flat with a simplistic and cliched storyline, and odd pacing."
5,The real deal,"This is REAL music - real stories, real scary, real funny. Patterson Hood, Mike Cooley and company write songs about real southern life, and the music is alternately blisterting and haunting. Catch this band live! They're even better on stage than on this remarkable album. ""Nine Bullets"" and ""Wife Beater"" will make the hair on the back of your neck stand up. ""Steve McQueen"" will make you laugh while you dance around. This is a great band that's only getting better.."
5,"this record is so good, you'll slap your momma!","The best way to describe this record is REAL. This is the real deal, with great songs that sway like a breeze at times, and rock like a tornado at others. They will make you forget that nashville is still trying to make records."
2,Good TV....if it doesn't break.,"I purchased this television in May, 2006, and it's performance was great while it lasted. After about 3 monhts, the tv began to malfunction. The colors would fade in and out, and then the picture would be rendered in about 4 colors, making everything on the screen a psychedelic blur. Eventually the screen would go out altogether, leaving me with a wonderful 32 inch flat-screen ""radio"". Westinghouse says they will take it back in for servicing, but it will cost me a fortune to ship it to them since I'm at an overseas military base. The bottom line is that this is a good tv, but it should have had a life span greater than three months."
1,Warning - no repair parts available,"I purchased a Westinghouse TV and one day it would not power on. I took it to a trusted repair shop who would not look at it because they said you can't get parts for ANY Westinghouse TVs. They did verify the power supply worked. Called Westinghouse to get it repaired. They won't repair it because they decided it has been out of warranty for 50 wks, though I haven't had the TV for 2 years. I offered to pay for the repair, but they won't let me ship it because it might get damaged. If it were under warranty, it could be shipped, go figure. I'm taking the repair shops advice and not purchasing another Westinghouse."
4,Evocative of the Smoky Old Barroom,"This one is called ""Here's to the Ladies"" and the name fits but it could just as well have been called ""Smoky old Barrooms"" for the music evokes images of being in just such a setting and listening to the musician. All of the songs do indeed make some reference to women and therein lies much of the appeal. These songs tug at the heartstrings.The style is pure Tony. These are not the big arrangements with large bands but are instead more intimate pieces with minimal but sufficient accompaniment. At times I thought the bass was too high but that was easily changed with the settings on my system. Except for the possible preponderance of bass, the quality of the recordings is excellent."
5,"He makes ""old"" songs ""new"" again!",Really a wonderful CD. Tony's range and creativity make this album interesting enough to listen to over and over. I thoroughly enjoy it.
2,Disco sobrevalorado...,"Cuando muchos dicen que Coldplay suena algo asi como una mala banda, debo decirles que ellos al meos si tienen mas pasion al hacer sus canciones, no como Oasis, que suena como gueva total.What's The Story) Morning Glory? resulta muy sobrevalorado...Mejor tarten de conseguirse discos comO Who next, Magical mystery Tour, Nevermind, Exile on main street o A rush of blood to the head, y dejen esto para cuando no tienes nada que pensar...Lastima por ""Wonderwall"" su unica buena cancion.Se parecen mas a los monkees que a los Beatles"
1,Is this music?,"I love music. I love jazz, rock, alternative, trip hop, good hip hop, classical.My theory: the more you like music, the less you like Oasis."
2,The sound of middle-age,"One of the most over rated albums ever - admittedly a few tunes ('Hey Now') are catchy but overall this album is BORING AS HELL, particuarly 'Don't Look Back In Anger' which makes Phil Collins sound practically dangerous. However, I give 2 stars because the 'Some Might Say' EP was fantastic - their last great musical moment before they turned into The Rutles from beyond hell."
2,A case of the blands,"Okay, so it's not a horrible album, but it's hardly the second coming. This CD, which I bought in a used CD bin at half price, just leaves me feeling empty, and that I spent too much. Who cares if they pinch from the Beatles? I just wish they would take the ideas and try to take it further. It's okay to steal or borrow ideas. Everyone does it, but you need to expand upon it. This is like the Beatles going backwards. Maybe some better arrangements and backing vocals would have helped. I don't know. I don't really have anything against this album. It's too bland for me to have built any passion about it either way."
4,Legendary,"Flicking through some of the reviews on here, I understand why some people don't like this. Oasis really typified the 90's Indie Rock scene in the UK, they stood for everything that was British culture at the time, they're lyrics and attitude was perfect. So for many americans, i can understand how this culture would pass you by, and in turn this album. Many people really had to be living in Britain at the time to fully get why Oasis and Blur etc were so big. It's much the same for a lot of American artists that we don't get over in the UK....Either way, a fantastic album full of meaning and great songs."
3,"Classic British Rock, but...","this group makes songs that are supposed to be catchy and ballad-like, but still rock songs. Despite many classic songs, the rest of the album is not catchy and so does not fulfill the purpose. Anyway, my favorite songs are ""wonderwall"", ""dont look back in anger"", and of course their best song ""champagne supernova"". Thanks for reading this review."
5,What an awesome album!,"i'm a huge oasis fan and i've been listening to this album alot on spotify. i tend to listen to it when i need to relax and mellow out. songs like ""wonderwall"",""champange supernova"",""morning glory"",""some might say"" are timeless songs on this album. (what's the story)morning glory? is an album that will never get old."
3,Has some good songs,I like the guys voice. Wonderwall is a amazing song and so is Don't Look Back in Anger. I like Morning Glory but besides those three there are only some decent and bad songs
2,BORING,"nothing else than boring, even the main track (""Wonderwall"") is as exiting as a math lesson. Don't buy it, simply buy ""Definitely Maybe"", their first commercial album and their greatest, or take a look to Blur o Radiohead instead. I save only ""don't look back in anger"", the reason of the second star"
3,It's alright....,"There's a little bit of filler in here, but I thought the best songs were Morning Glory, Wonderwall, Don't Look Back in Anger, and Champagne Supernova. However Definitely Maybe was a lot better; their ego hadn't swelled up yet, and they had something to prove. As a result, Definitely Maybe is catchier, and more guitar-oriented....."
3,Not Very Original,"I'd rate this three and 1/2 stars if I could, because it's got 4 standout songs on it. Certainly, it's worth owning for them alone. The four tracks are, in my opinion: Wonderwall, Don't Look Back in Anger, Morning Glory, and Champaigne Supernova.Despite what others have said, I'd have to rate the rest of this album as throw-away, especially ""Hey Now."" Songs like ""She's Electric"" sound OK but suffer from weak lyrics. The overall problem on this album is that Oasis is trying too hard to sound like something. They're trying to sound Beatles-esque instead of playing what comes naturally for them. (To me, this is true for the music and lyrics, but more so for the lyrics.) Even the good songs exhibit this: ""Gonna start a revolution from my bed..."" Gee, you mean like JOHN LENNON did?The first song I heard off this album was Wonderwall, which is a sweet, sincere song. This album is well worth buying if you like the tunes, but I feel it could've used more sincerety overall."
4,good followup,"After the 1st album (Definitely Maybe) it was going to be hard to match that epic. The lads do a good job of trying as so many tracks on this album do hit the mark. ""Don't Look Back in Anger"" is a standout but it's not the only one. ""Hello,"" ""Wonderwall,"" ""Some Might Say,"" ""she's Electric"" and ""Morning Glory"" all stack up well.The weakest track is the single ""Roll With It"" which sounds at best like a B-side. Also, ""Champagne Supernova"" is far too long. Clocking in at 7 mins 27 secs, I had time to go make tea and have some crumpet (hey, I work fast...what can I tell ya).All bad puns aside, the overall feel of this album is less a sonic explosion and more a fun night out at the pub or on holiday. It doesn't make it less enticing, just different."
5,Very Good Album,"Stop the comparison between Oasis and the Beatles. The Beatles are the greatest band ever. Noel Gallagher will tell you that. Fact Oasis has released six albums of new material, 1 live album, and 1 b sides album of previously released material. Oasis has released eight albums. Oasis has six number 1 albums on the UK charts. The poll of the greatest albums of all time was conducted in the UK not the US. Get your facts straight before you bash Oasis. This is a very good album! Please listen to the CD before you review it!"
4,What Can I Say? This Stuff's Pretty AMAZING!!!,"I have never even heard one British band ever before, until Oasis's (What's Your Story) Morning Glory?, and loved it! My only problem with this album, and the reason why I rated this item 4 stars, instead of 5 is because the songs are kind of annoying after five minutes or so (every song is dreadfully long) and some get stuck in my head for as much as three days at a time!"
4,MADCHESTER!,"One of the essential albums of the 90s has everything you would ever want from any album. Pure rock and roll (Morning Glory,Roll with it) Beutiful Ballads (Wonderwall, Cast No Shadow)Anthems (Don't look back in anger,Champagne Supernova)and cool lively pop tunes (She's Electric). Crulely grabbed away from perfection by mediocre songs like Hello and Hey Now this album was when Noel Gallagher was the Brit Pop King writing some of Oasis' greatest hits.These Days Oasis are good but not great and have lost a lot of fans but if anyone denys that they liked this album they'd be lying through their teeth.1995 was Oasis'year!The Ultimate Manchester album!"
5,Best album of the 1990's,"Brit Pop Rules.....Thank God this album ended the unspeakable grundge ""movement""....Also...no album since is even close.Way to go Oasis."
4,"The band's arrogance aside, this is a great album","I didn't particularly want to like this record but I think it's one of the finest pop records I've heard in years. Liam Gallagher may make you want to slap his arrogant face but he's never boring and I love his singing throughout the album, particularly on such tracks as ""Cast No Shadow"". And Noel proves that he's a damn good songwriter, too, even though he's as derivative of artists he admires as any composer in rock history. Is that so bad, though? At least he picked great role models."
2,"Egotism outweights quality, as usual.","Oasis have to be the worst musicians on the planet, rehashed music (obviously stolen from a better source), a lead singer who couldn't carry a tune if it was strapped to his back, terribly written and jumbled lyrics, and not enough originality to fill a thimble. And yet, this album is not too bad, you just have to look past all the bad stuff. Songs like ""Wonderwall"", ""Don't Look Back in Anger"", and ""Champaign Supernova"" make for good background music, but nothing else. The rest is insubstantial, second rate pop music without point. Why Oasis are called the kings of Britpop is beyond my understanding, they have done nothing. Speaking of stealing from a better source, has anybody noticed the striking similarity between ""Don't Look Back in Anger"" and John Lennon's ""Imagine""? An album with no meaning and no point, Oasis are a lego-like figure of what a proper band should be. Pass."
3,Great album if you dig plagerism.,"I would like to thank The Beatles, Bob Dylan and David Bowie for making this album possible. If you have no idea what I'm talking about,listen to the tracks ""Wonderwall""(the name of George Harrison's first solo album) and ""Don't Look Back in Anger""(derived from Bob Dylan's ""Don't Look Back and David Bowie's ""Look Back in Anger"". An infinitely better song). The only thing this album has going for it is ""catchy tunes"" that stick in your head. What this album doesn't have going for it is originality. And the worst part is that they know they're doing it and they make like they're creating art. I think the line: ""The sound you make is MUZAK to my ears"" from John Lennon's ""How Do You Sleep?"" can be said for the Gallagher brother's entire career. A catchy dud."
3,What a great tribute band,"Back in the mid to late nineties Oasis were pop rock superstars. The bands sound hinged of course on songwriter Liam Gallagher's quest for the perfect pop song, sometimes he gets close to striking gold. ""Wonderwall"", even for its cheesy retro sound is still infectious, and ""Champagne Supernova"" has a melody that is utterly unforgettable. Unfortunately, the bands love of sixties pop can strip their sound of any personality. So while the album may have its moments you can't really call Oasis a great rock band, what you could call them is a great tribute band."
1,a cloned band,it's one thing to influenced by someone it's another to ride on there coattails.Oasis just takes a plenty from the Beatles.they may play there own instruments but a Puffy Daddy is a Puffy Daddy.meaning come up with something Original and your own.the vocals and the music arrangements are riding all on the Lennon&Mccartney pen &riffs.they are way to cocky as well.at best they are a 2nd tier band.
2,""" ""","I like the song Wonderwall. It had something special and undeniable but I just can't get into the majority of Oasis music. They occasionally hit on something that is ""catchy"" but since the Beatles broke up, anything vaguely ""catchy"" is considered to be ""Beatlesque"". Likewise, nowadays, when anything is ""catchy"", it would have to be considered ""rare"". Arrangement wise, I've always thought of Oasis as more like a wall of sound. Which is ""Spectoresque"". I'm a guitar player and a recording engineer and I just don't think their guitar player is especially good and their recordings are muddy. A free for all. That may be due to the fact that a lot of guitar players who aren't very good hide the fact by playing very loudly. I don't want to bash the group. I want to like them but I just can't. Besides this one, I own two more of their albums."
3,"not rubbish, but definately overrated","My sister gave me this album because she had bought it on impulse and regretted it. I have been unable to pass it on to anyone else since. This album is poor. I feel like the boy in the story of 'The Emperor's new Clothes' because everyone else likes it but there you go. It is stuff like this that turns me off guitar music. The title track is good, but generally this album can't match Oasis' debut 'Definately Maybe,' or indeed their contemporaries Blur, who, unlike Oasis, are still producing good albums. This was maybe the biggest selling British album of the 1990s. But I don't think people were buying the music, they were buying the attitude. Whenever a guitarist wants to jam he breaks into 'Wonderwall,' thus ruining any pleasure from the session. Come back Stairway to Heaven, all is forgiven."
4,Great songs,"With a name like Oasis, who would've thought that I would actually like the music? I heard Wonderwall and Champagne Supernova on the radio, and I thought they were pretty good. I bought the CD a few months ago, and all the songs are great. Other people have said that the lyrics are incomprehensible and things, but really, who cares? I like rhythm, not lyrics, and this group has lots of it, and quite a variety, too. From the slow Champagne Supernova to the upbeat Roll With It. My favorite is She's Electric. I would definitely recommend this album to anyone who likes their music with some variety and British accents."
4,It doesn't get musch better than this,"All the songs are catchy and on this album you are guaranteed pleasure from start to finish. Fist song is 'hello' which is simple pop/rock song, then comes roll with it which is kind of annoying and my least favourtie song on the album.Wonderwall and don't look back in anger are the two most famous oasis tunes in the uk and are with out a doubt the two best britpop songs. Hey now is a great song with a wonderful guitar towards the end and maybe my favourite song. Some might say is a powerful, fast and catchy song but then next comes the brilliant cast no shadow which could have been a #1 single if they released it this song is a masterpiece.She's electric is a simple pop song and morning glory is rocker which gives the album a great mix. Then champagne supernova is one of the best songs ever but too long, then again this song ends the album nicely.This album is worth buying it is what music is missing today."
5,why i love music,"Wow it the first word i thought of when Hello came on. This cd is probably one of the best follow-up cds ever. I love Oasis and every cd the same. If i were to tell people what cd to buy first id say this one just because wonderwall is on it. I do not care for that song because everyone else loves it, but to start off i would tell people to get this one. Cast no shadow and Morning Glory are awesome. Hey Now is a great song too, but no one ever talks about it. Then there is Some might say and Roll With it, which are also instant classics along with She's Electric and CS."
1,"Did anyone say ""talent""?","These guys are really bad. The lyrics are bad; the music is recycled and watered-down Beatles. Enough marketing, and anyone can be a big star...."
2,Sentimental & Depressing,"Was having a tough day when ordering this. Music from teenage years. These were songs I liked back in the day. However, compared to most of the other music I have or listen to, Oasis is a downer. If I can get past the depressing quality of the music, it's fine.I suggest find something less depressing."
2,It Needed More...,"If one were to choose the best Oasis album thus far, I suppose this would be it. Wonderwall, Don't Look Back In Anger, and Champagne Supernova are quite good, but there really isn't anything else on this album worth paying money for. Since Morning Glory is fairly old, chances are you've already heard the good songs played dozens of times on the radio...from there, you can do the math."
2,This is NOT The Beatles!,"What's with all these comparisons to The Beatles? Both bands are of British origin, but that is where any similarity ends. The Beatles' style included harmony & background vocals, as well as a polished sound. Oasis features only lead vocals with no harmonizing or background vocals, and seems to be going for a raunchier sound. Catchy tunes, but The Beatles? NOT EVEN CLOSE!"
2,Oasis the Beatles wannabees,"OKAY let's state the obvious here: You don't have to be real hard core Beatles fan to notice how Beatlesque the band Oasis sounds. <Note to Noel Gallagher: you're full of it, man. You shouldn't call people nipples especially when they're the guitarist for the band you're trying to (miserably, I might add) copy off of.> This CD sounds like what a Beatles tribute band would sound like if they tried to write all original songs...it still has that strong Beatlesy vibe to it. This CD is a crappy, lame British Invasion revival attempt by a bunch of sad poseurs who can't find their own sound so they try and rip off of the one British band that started this whole thing. I don't like Oasis because of who they are and what they have publically said about one of my idols, and yes I know that personal opinions shouldn't affect the way I feel about their music, and so I'm rating this album 2 stars 'cause you gotta give these guys at least some props for trying."
1,Champagne Supercrap In the Sky,This album is dated. The musicianship is mediocre at best. They can't pull it off live. You'll be more proud of the Bay City Roller albums in your collection than this.
2,gross how can anyone listen to this crap?,"here's what i want all oasis fans to do:1) go get a pencil/pen and a piece of paper.2) now, write down oasis lyrics as you hear them.3) read the written lyrics out loud.unless ur totally stupid, you would notice that the lyrics suck unlike anything u've ever heard.they get 2 stars from me cuz the guitar's alrite."
5,My god.,"Absolutely the best album of the nineties. Inspiring, simple lyrics fitting bittersweet ballads and jump starting rock pop radio friendly tunes. The best song, by far, on the album is the simple and beautiful anthem of hope ""Don't Look Back In Anger."" Hard core Beatles and Blur fans will most likely loath this album, but anyone who wants to feel good about themselves or just here some really great brit-pop rock'n'roll... this album is for you!"
4,Real music for a change!,"Noel Gallagher is extremely talented and Liam has the sexiest voice around. It's too bad that more of the USA hasn't discovered talent. However, if you've listened to this CD and aren't thrilled with it, check out Be Here Now. That's why I gave this CD 4 stars-I was spoiled with the more mature Oasis before going back to their old stuff."
4,Oasis,Good music. Relaxed and a little angsty. I like Oasis in general and I think this CD was a good examply of what they can do.
4,I actually like it,"I didn't particularly expect to enjoy anything by Oasis...their whole additude towards the world is, to say the least, a bit off putting. But after someone lent me a collection of CDs for a week, this was the only one I felt compelled to buy for myself and listen to more. Though there's only one or two songs that actually make me think, it's fun to listen to and good rock and all that. I only just got it, so I don't know how it'll hold up in the long run, but right now I'm enjoying it (and I got it used, very cheap)."
4,They should have taken more time,"There are very, very strong songs here. Wonderwall, obviously, Don't Look Back in Anger, and Morning Glory. I'd put Noel's songwriting efforts through this album with just about anybody in the '90s, and his work on ""Be Here Now"" simply reinforces that fact.However, there are some dogs here. ""Roll With It"" and ""Hey Now"" are skipped over every time I listen to it. Had they spent more than 15 days recording it, as they did, they would have had a 5-star effort."
1,it wasnt all that great in my opinion,"The music in this cd was repetative and boring. Maybe its just Oasis as a whole, but im not sure."
3,oi mate,"all this talk of 'best band since the beatles'.....'no british band has ever made anything as good as this or ever will'err what about 'the stone roses'?c'mon people, see where it all really started!!!this player is okay, obvious good points have been mentioned b4 'wonderwall' and 'champagne supernova', but theres really nothing exciting here. just a player thats loud and inoffensive."
2,British doesn't make it good,"Guitars and drums drone on on this album with little sense of rhythm or definite melody. Oasis are clearly ambitious artists, as they laquer synthesizers and orchestras on top of endless layers of guitars. Instead of a wall of sound, however, we get an album that sounds like mud and makes me question whether my speakers are broken. They aren't, but my taste was when I purchased this album."
2,OVERRATED..............Defintely maybe,"There first album is first rate and I was hooked.I became an Oasis junkie.Morning Glory is way overrated ""morning glory"" and ""dont look back in anger"" are the best songs on this album. This album is not supersonic. Is that blur i hear?"
4,An upbeat rockin' album,"Oasis hit big with ""What's the Story Morning Glory?"" This CD played non-stop for a while around my house, and I love all the songs on the album. However, there are only 10 real tracks on this album; don't be fooled by the ""untitled"" tracks. They are both about a minute long and provide a segue between songs. Perhaps if Oasis had waited a little longer, they could have included more real songs instead of leaving you wanting more...which admittedly they do provide with ""be Here Now,"" their third CD."
5,"The story is ""They are the BEST!""","Again with the second album oasis show they are getting better, the songs are fantastic and with a new drummer they show new dimensions. Whats the Story? has amazing songs like Wonderwall, Don't look back in anger, Champaign Supernova and Morning Glory. The songs that agin became world anthems of 95-96, the boys are back! Oasis=the best. END"
3,I hate the band but I love their music!,I serioulsy cant stand this band but one year I just was listening to the radio and I was like wow! I got the CD and I never stopped listening to it. The songs are like tatooed to my brain which is insane because not only do I not like the band I loathe this type of music! But I love this Cd and I will refuse to part with it.
3,"""Someday you will find me caught beneath the landslide...""","This album was a must-have for me, because the singles were circulating when I was a teenager and just beginning to pay attention to rock stations that excluded pop songs. Oasis' sound consists of spacey guitars, thick British accent and the familiar hits ""Wonderwall"", ""Champaign Supernova"" and the sentimental ""Don't Look Back In Anger"", which is commonly mistaken as a Lennon piece for its piano and perhaps the line ""So I'll start a revolution from my bed.""While I don't listen to this album in its entirety or find the hitless tracks to be very memorable, I do reach for this disc regularly to hear the songs from that alternative time of 1995. It's a keeper, and I recommend it to those who have already sampled the tracks and are looking to add this band to their collection, because you get every one of their popular releases on the CD. It's the best alternative to downloading the individual nuggets of gold."
4,Missing...,"Would have given 5 stars but I'm old school and miss the sleeve, notes, pics, etc that used to come with a purchase. I guess some day I'll get over it for the ease of a download purchase. Maybe one day they'll add those files???? Maybe that would do it for us ???"
2,Oasis is certainly nothing like The Beatles.,"It is impossible to understand why the band Oasis is compared to The Beatles. This album is like thousand's that are released every day. No creativity, no punch. BORING!! They are probably the most overrated band of all times."
1,Overrated,"The Gallaghers produce an album that is lacking in originality, coherency, music ability and lyrical depth. Clearly trading on his arrogant mancunian attitude and blustering pretentious vocal manner, Liam's own self-love is ironic when compared to the superficial derivative pap on display here. There is no attempt to create any sense of emotional empathy in the songs, indeed the whining anthemic dirges are more akin to football chants. Don't believe the hype - despite the Gallagher's claims, they are still a media-manufactured creation that has been manipulated for maximum accessability: rebellion in a nice, neat fashionable parcel."
1,Tired whining of the mono-browed one,Essentially this CD has the same song rehashed over and over. Meaningful lyrics - HAH! This is an unoriginal piece of tripe. If you're an aspiring rock star then buy it - if Oasis could make it big then any talentless fool can.
1,"Bad, bad, bad.","Not much else to say. This is bad music, bad lyrics. In ten years, these guys will try to stage a comeback, and you'll all be laughing to yourselves, asking ""Did I used to listen to junk like that?'"
2,THE WORST BEATLES ALBUM IN 30 YEARS...,"What the hell?!?! Here are two simple exercises for you to do: 1.) Listen to the end of ""She's Electric"" and then listen to the end of ""With A Little Help From My Friends"" on Sgt. Pepper. A more blatent rip-off I cannot imagine. Oh, and speaking of ""Imagine""... 2.) Listen to the intro to ""Don't Look Back In Anger"" and then listen to the intro to ""Imagine,"" by John Lennon. Hmmm... rip-off artists? Definately Maybe. As a huge Beatles fan, the only reason I gave this 2 stars was because what they do is out of respect for the Beatles and also because Liam Gallagher named his baby Lennon."
5,This is the best album since the beatles disolved,"I think this is one of the greatest albums in the history of rock. I hate when some people say that oasis is not a great band, the songs in What's the Story are some of the best that i've listened to in my life. Don't look back in anger is a masterpiece and Wonderwall is sensational, i just hope that people will start to listen carefuly to what the Manchester group has to say."
5,utter brilliance,"listen not to the most amazon recent reviews of this album; for this is oasis at their dazzling best. never before has rock history been mixed so effectively; cross the beatles with the sex pistols with the stone roses and you'll find noel and liam gallagher. oasis wear their influences on their sleeves, granted, but what good taste they have."
5,Best Album Ever,"Despite the Gallagher brother's being total prats with all their antics, you can't deny that their music is superb.Whats the story Morning Glory is one of those rare albums you will hear, where all the tracks are great. Wonderwall, Champagne Supernova, Don't look back in anger, Roll with it, Some might say, She's Electric and my personal favourite Morning glory, all are really great tracks and sum up the greatness of British Music.It's a shame some of the later music is not as good as this masterpiece. However I believe, after the release of Heathen Chemistry, is does seem that Oasis are on the right path and are almost back to producing the music their reknown for.Anyway I urge you all to buy this CD, as frankly it really is one of those great albums that will never be forgotten."
3,Better than expected,"As the story goes, Pete Lush happened upon an 8-track and decided to translate his anomalous thoughts into a somewhat palatable musical format. What was born from such a peculiar thought process was a record that is heavily weighted down by mood, deepened emotions and delicate acoustical arrangements compressed with random sounds. As genuine as the music is, it does tend to be on the sullen side with rare moments of anything resembling an upbeat moment. Vocally, Pete utilized his breathless, super luxuriant vocals that switch back and forth from the conversational to the sublime. This one had rainy day soundtrack written all over it but may be best listened to when you are in the mood for introspective thought. It also won't be one for high volume either but it's vibe is open for interpretation. Think of it as an extension of ones creative ability to transfuse their eclectic thoughts into music that seems abstract on the surface but doesn't confuse the listener."
5,the beggining,"the beggining of Ray Charles, photos, lyrics, everything you need to know before he got famous."
3,Not bright enough,"I bought one of these lights because the light in the room where I practice was not bright enough for my old eyes. Unfortunately, although the light is attractive, and stays in position on my stand, it isn't nearly bright enough. In fact, I can hardly tell it is on. There is a two position switch, but nodifference in the light between the two positions. I wouldn't recommend it."
3,Mighty Bright Not Bright Enough,"I just bought one of these and I find that I'm not liking the type of light it puts out -- a weak, pale bluish shade of light. Very LED-ish. It is not as bright as I had hoped and doesn't light up my music on the stand adequately. It's cute, I love the flexible neck and compact size - I just wish it gave off a brighter, warmer shade of light."
3,"Adequate, not great","Ordered this for my son for his piano sheet music. It throws an adequate amount of light, but it could be brighter. The field of light does not quite encompass two full pages, so the edge of the music can fall into shadows toward the top of the pages. Probably should have gone with the two-light model."
4,Searching for Consolation,"I can listen to this all day! Reminds me so much of my grandmother and Mother. This is so down to earth,soul-stirring! Shirley Caesar's music is the ""quicker picker upper"". There is no other comparison. These selections will console you like a mother's child. If you are looking for some moving spirituals -- buy this!"
4,Female Problems,"I hesitated picking up this short memoir, thinking a book that focused on such topics as female problems beneath my modern feminist dignity, but ended up finding the frank discussion of the female body and its midlife crises rather refreshing. It's easy to dismiss Kaysen (who of course wrote GIRL INTERRUPTED) as a whiner and a chronic malcontent, but anyone who contends with a medical problem that contemporary medicine can't solve knows how frustrating life can be. She honestly and humorously chronicles the horrors of aging -- parts that don't work right (in this case her own vulva), doctors who don't seem to be able to find the right cure, men one might fancy who prefer women their own age (much younger), and the importance of a good sex life to one's general well-being. It was laugh-out-loud funny and poignant at the same time."
3,"Amusing, entertaining, and emotive","I wanted to read Girl, Interrupted but couldn't find it, found this by the same author. The author has a great voice, you can almost hear her intonations as she writes quite comedically and at times poignantly. She is suffering from a difficult health problem which catalyses the end of a relationship. An easy read that isn't trashy or corny, but instead an amusing glimpse into another person's trials and tribulations."
2,Left so many questions.,"I read this book because I was recently diagnosed with vulvodynia. While it was a quick and easy read, it simply left so many unanswered questions for me. I know it's not exactly a textbook on the condition, so it wouldn't give me answers for my own situation. But I was finding myself frustrated that she didn't explore the situation about frequent urination, which is something I understand. I would have loved to know more about that, instead of her fight against it. It did make me appreciate how caring and understanding my fiance is compared to her horrible boyfriend.It's good for a light read to get more information about the emotions of women who suffer from this. But if you are looking for answers, look in other books."
4,Funny and thought provoking!,"Having read Girl, Interrupted, Susanna Kaysen's gripping and comic memoir, I didn't hesitate to pick up this book. The Camera My Mother Gave Me is a thought-provoking and witty memoir about Kaysen's encounters with various doctors -- gynecologists, vulvologists, internists, alternative health physicians -- in a quest to find out what is wrong with her vagina. Her vagina suffers from a mysterious illness that doctors have not been able to identify -- thus, said illness interferes with her relationship with her boyfriend. Should she insist on getting to the bottom of things, or should she learn to live with her unidentified condition?Funny, intelligent and compelling, The Camera My Mother Gave Me is a short memoir that ought to be read from cover to cover. I recommend it most highly."
1,Not worth it,"I'm not sure which book the other reviewers are talking about when they say this book is funny. I didn't find it funny at all. In fact, I found it tiresome. The author is whiny. The fact that she starts so many sentences off with, ""My vagina..."" and uses the f-word so much just gets old. At some point, the use of the word becomes gratuitous and unnecessary. Her delivery is bland and dispassionate for someone who is narrating her own book. This book bored me stiff."
5,Therapy in a book.,"Thank you for this book. I suffer from the same disorder as the author and reading about her going through the same things I have made me feel like I'm not alone. This disorder is very different and unlike any other ""women's problem"" out there because no one really knows how to treat it. I read this book in one afternoon. I couldn't put it down."
4,What helped,"Very helpful to read a person's real experiences, thanks to Susanna. This condition can also affect the bladder. What helped me: two liters of water per day including half a litre of club soda, no caffeine, sugar or yeast.These real life stories help other sufferers and medicos to understand these conditions better."
2,Duke Nukem: Manhattan Project,"Duke Nukem Manhattan project is a 3D sidescroller and is the fourth Duke Nukem game. You as Duke Nukem must save the planet from the mutants and their cybrog leader. I played the game in the OpenGL video mode and it runs great, Direct3D is also available. It is the best looking sidescroller i have ever played, The graphics and sound are great. The single player is quite dissappointing, The game is not very long and it is mostly shoot everything that moves and the puzzles are just find the key card. There is nothing new between the levels and it is not a hard game, besides the boss in the seventh episode the rest of the game was easy. Duke Nukem Manhattan project is disappointing."
2,Not the same Duke we all loved,"What happened to this game? This game is in 3rd person!! What is up with that? Poor Duke, I hate to see you go this way 'ol buddy. This would have been a great follow-up to the original, but not after playing Duke in 1st person for so long. Good-bye old freind. We all hope to see the real Duke again someday. This was a disapointment. Don't get me wrong, for what it is, the graphics are good. If you had never played the other it might be OK."
1,Couldn't run it on my computer,"The game requires more computer than I have - at least in order to SEE it. It REQUIRES one of two video cards - nVidia GeForce 7600 or GTS/ATI Radion HD 2600 with 256MB ram. They recommend even higher performance cards with 512MB ram. These requirements were not listed on the Amazon page. I acnot rate the game higher because I cannot play it. My computer is 2.6GHz Intel Core 2, Windows 7 (64 bit) with 4GB ram and many available GB of hard disk space left. But it only has the standard Intel chip set video adapter. I don't play often enough to buy another $100 worth of video card."
5,This game *IS* 3D!,"What is with all this ""THE GAME SUX BECAUSE IT IS NOT 3D"" bashing? This is just gratuitous bashing that has no reason to exist, because DNMP *is* a 3D game!See the rendering options? OPENGL and DIRECT3D!See the name of the engine? PRISM3D!See the POLYGONAL characters and TRIDIMENSIONAL environments?See the camera move IN and OUT, and ROTATE around ALL THREE AXES?See Duke Nukem being able to move along CURVILINEAR paths, and the camera following him all the way?See the level editor, where you can create ANY LEVEL YOU WOULD IN QUAKE?If you have an nVidia video card, you can also download the STEREOSCOPIC 3D DRIVERS, get a pair of eDimensional glasses or a Z800 visor and enjoy Duke Nukem Manhattan Project in REAL, STEREOSCOPIC 3D, and see a SOLID, TRIDIMENSIONAL DUKE NUKEM move in a VAST TRIDIMENSIONAL SPACE!On the other hand, if your gripe is that you must follow predetermined paths, DUH! IT WOULDN'T BE A SIDESCROLLER ANYMORE IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO, WOULD IT?"
1,Save your money,"Side scroller, no 3-D. The first Dukes were much better. Save your money for Doom III. You'll find my copy of DNMP on eBay in a bit."
5,Awesome!,"This game is awesome, it is NOT like the Duke Nukem 3d of 1996 we all remember, the third person shooter, but more like the 1991 version updated with great graphics. I do think it is worth getting if you are a Duke Nukem fan. I found it to be thrilling, can't wait for another FPS from these guys starting Duke."
1,Truth is it's a failed duke product by 3drealms !,"Don't believe the others who give this game 5 stars. This game is nowhere as good as Duke3d. Sure, if you want side scrollers then this game may be good for you although it sure doesn't beat the Commander Keen series as well as other platform games out there. Moreover, this game was released as a result of 3drealms's once again failed attempt to get DNF out the door."
1,dont waste your money,"I just downloaded the demo, and I can not believe the released this trash. It does not even live up to it previous titles. even if you go back before dukenukem 3d, the old games are far more superior. they told and old game and put a new setup on it so it would work in windows xp. dont buy it go get aliens vs preditors, or something. i just never expected 2 steps back form 3d gamers software company, they must have fired the old programmers and have a newbee programming. It is sad said hunk of junk. if you like 3rd person shooters max payne, counterstrike much beter, that is why i quit playing dukenuken in the first place."
1,No where near the fun of Duke Nukem 3D,"Regretably this not the same type first person shooter as Duke Nukem 3D, this is a sorry Acrade style spin off that I've since gotten rid of and I warn people away from purchasing."
2,GameBoy for the PC,Don't waste your Gaming Computer and game playing time with this game unless you missing playing on your GameBoy. Limited two Dimension play with uncreative graphics. Not a true sequel.
2,Disappointing =(,"As a fan of Duke from the beginning I was a little disappointed by this release. Seems like in 2002 we could ask for better...... Come on, a side-scroller with poor graphics and no network play? Thats so dated. I have a P3 not a 486. Soured by this experience I anxiously await the Duke Nukem Forever release of the ""Real"" game. Out in.....forever.=("
1,Big Fan of Duke...Not This Game Though,Very disappointed in this version of Duke Nukem. I didn't care for the side motion and third person view. Previous versions although DOS based were much funnier to play. Also it ran like ... on my computer running Win ME.
2,"""Sounds like a bad action movie.""","The plot for this movie is actually quite good, a microbiochemical weapon accidently created and released on the world is captured and is being brought back from Russia, but the Russians are trying to recapture it and release it on the major cities of the world and it is up to our ""hero"" to stop them before it happens. What ruins this great movie is the very bad acting. When asked if he knew about Agent Red, Dolph's character said it best, ""Sounds like a bad action movie,"" and it is. From LT. Christian being seriously out of uniform to the underlying ""love story"", this movie just reeks. The only good thing I saw in this movie was Randolph Mantooth. His small part made up for the movie in my opinion. So unless you're a big Mantooth fan, this movie is a waste of money."
1,Agent Dread!,"This movie is so bad, it barely deserves mention. However, I am a big DL fan, and I am writing this in the hope that Dolph will not abandon his fans---he may be making movies like this just for the $$, but, I believe, he is also doing irreparable damage to his career."
3,ANOTHER VIRAL THREAT,"AGENT RED is yet another in a long line of killer virus movies. For a low budget thriller, this isn't too bad, though. Dolph Lundgren, never one accused of acting, is even stiffer than usual, but in all actuality, he's not in the movie as much as one would think. Hiding in cameo roles are Stephen Macht and Steve Franken; Meilani Paul and Natalie Radford are the femme fatales, and a nasty Russian villain played by Alexander something or other does a fairly decent job.There are some tense moments and Agent Red is a real nasty virus. Don't miss former EMERGENCY star Randolph Mantooth in a role as the admiral of a naval carrier."
3,Pretty good movie but some inconsistencies,"Well first off I would like to say that I enjoyed the movie very well and reading some other reviews, I have come to a conclusion that maybe I like bad action movies. Another thing I have noticed is that people are saying that there is other footage taken from other movies, I'm really not sure about that. One other thing that I had is that the marines uniform and the navy uniforms are not correct! Now I'm in the marine corps and it sort of makes me mad that they can't even make correct uniforms! Here is just one of the examples is one female is wearing Private first class Cheverons and then has officer rank on her coller! What is that! Anyway I just thought that I would share that with you. But over all I would say it was a good movie."
1,Don't even bother!!,"...The dialogue was so artificial and the acting was so poor. It seems that some one tried to mix ""Executive Decision"", that the bit when Dolph tapped the submarine steel hull to send morse codes, Steven Seagal ""Under Siege"" martial arts display and special ops background + calling off the attack of fighter jets shooting air to air missiles which miraculously changed into anti-submarine torpedoes but keep on missing the target. I never thought a Harpoon anti-ship missile could be used to shoot down a Mach-1 or more fighter jet. As for ""Agent Red"", well better spend you money on books on genetic engineering or microbiology. As for the containment room, a high school positive pressure cabinet has more chance of containing the virus, which were kept in glass vials so thin that they broke so easily."
1,You've got to be kidding -- AVOID THIS MOVIE!,This movie was so bad (How Bad Was It?) that I turned it off after about 25 minutes. This is only the second time in my life I stopped watching a movie because it was so poorly done. DO NOT RENT OR BUY THIS MOVIE!
2,I can't get anyone to watch this with me.,"I bought this movie previously viewed for 2 bucks, if that tells you about the quality. It looks and sounds like it will be the worst movie I own, and after I read the other reviews, I am looking forward to watching it...If I can get myself inebriated enough. So far after 5 weekends, my friends and I haven't been able to get up the courage to watch this past the previews yet.If we do this weekend finally, and it is actually good(???) then I will come back on here and post a RAVE REVIEW. If not, this review will stand.Best Movie of the Day (when I didn't watch any other movies)-raves Erik of Longview."
4,Go Swimming With Emmet,"""Wake"" is a catchy, infectous modern rock pop album from this suburban Washington D.C. (Virginia) band. The thirteen songs glide by effortslessly, piling on one decent hook after another. This is pop rock at its best, never to tart, never too deep, concerned (mostly) with relationships both successful and failed. The highlights include the rocking opening cut ""Jump Into the Water,"" the mournfully poetic ""Broken Oar,"" the superb, seductive ballad ""You're So Pretty,"" and the failed relationship cut, ""Ed's Song."" There is not a bad track in the mix, though several in the second half are filler material.Overall, a sweet modern rock pop gem that deserves a wider audience."
2,Bland vocals create disappointing effort,"Picked up this CD for $1 based upon the interesting artwork. I found lead singer Erik's voice quite monotonous, killing any chance to enjoy the songs and experience his songwritting. Every track I found myself thinking ""this needs harmony""."
1,Sorry to burst your bubble,"I tried hard to really like these guys, being from the East Coast and all, and Emmet being local. Maybe they are better live, but frontman Todd Watts has a very weak voice and no memorable songs leap out at you. After all, if they were good, they'd at least be at the popularity level of a Train or even a Sister Hazel. Unfortunately, they should be called Emmet Drowning."
3,missing artist in list,"I bought this albulm when it first came out. I found myself really enjoying the songs sung by my favorite of the artist that comprise the album; but they are all refreshing variations of the familiar hymns. The track listing on this website does not mention the artist for the last two tracks: ""The Savior is Waiting""-TAKE 6 and ""Onward, Christian Soldiers""-Petra"
4,Good album,"I first bought this album in 1991 when it was brand new. At the time, as a high schooler, this album succeeded in introducing me to the beautiful words of the many traditional hymns that most churches no longer play (in favor of more up-beat ""praise"" songs). And therefore, the album definitely succeeded in its mission to introduce youth like myself to the timeless majesty of the old hymns. Listening to it now as an adult, I still find myself struck by the beauty of many of the re-mixes. Yes, some of the early 90's takes on the old classics now sound a but cheesy, but overall this is a wonderful album."
3,An album for 80's nostalgics,"I don't agree with some of the reviews posted. You have to take this album for what it really is: a redition to old hymns interpreted in the style of each artist. Some succeeded, some failed: true. But still, there sure are 4 or 5 tracks in there that are well done. Amy Grant is the highlight on this album but Michael W Smith didn't fail neither. Keaggy's tribute to ""Our God in ages past"" isn't that bad neither, except the intro that I personally skip.. Michael W Smith didn't ruin the timeless hymn Holy Holy Holy, I find it at the contrary very well done, he respected the main structure and melody of the chorus, but added his own talented touch. If I have to advice a great rendition to the Hymns, then I would highly recommend the great ""4HIM and Hymns"". There everyone may easily find an arrangement that will fit his/her expectations.. I can assure you."
2,I'd pass,"All the hymns selected are standards that have survived centuries and continue to have just as much power today. However, these contemporary artists try to reinvent the wheel on some of these songs and some fail miserably. The grandeur of the hymns are lost in replacement of synthesized modern sounds that really don't fit with these types of songs.The only track that I enjoy is Amy Grant's redition of ""'Tis So Sweet to Trust in Jesus."" I don't believe this track by Amy can be found on any other CD. It's the one redeeming track. But isn't that what God's grace is all about? The message is still powerful. I would find a more traditional arrangement of these hymns."
2,Teenage Morality Plot,This book seems to be written for young girls since it is rather simplistic writing and a series of morality events.
5,Groovy and mysterious,"Shriekback was my favorite band of the 80's. They did jungle-techno before it was cool, and this album may be their best. It contains their one radio hit--""Nemesis,"" which was probably the first hit song to use the word 'parthenogenesis.' Whispery, slithery vocals on top of lush synthesizer tracks with gobs of drums. Still a great party album."
3,"Easy to install, but blocks other outlets","The unit was very easy to install, but upon attaching the unit to the outlet cover it become obvious that only certain type plugs if any will be able to fit next to this unit. So in other words if you are going to install it where you need to reguarly plug something else in be warned. The Petsafe people were somewhat helpful in answering me if it was ok to have this unit connected in addition to having the main unit grounded to the house main ground."
1,Not needed,"The System has a built in lightning protector , not knowing this we ordered it , the had to return it."
3,Not what we expected,My husband looked it over and thought that it looked cheap and was worried that it wont protect from a major surge. I liked that it is small and wont take up to much more room in my garage.
5,Works great so far,So far since we have had the fence we have not had too many thunder and lightning storms but in the event that we do and it does strike something I hope this holds up to it's description (my dogs do too!)
4,works great,"I purchased the lightning protector after my first petsafe transmitter got struck. This device protects the transmitter from surges on both the incoming power and the fence wire. So far we've had a few bad storms and the fence system still works fine. Its still best to unplug it if you realize the storm is coming, because the protector can only survive so big a hit before it needs replacement."
4,Petsafe lightning protector,"I recievied this order very quickly after placing order. This unit was very easy to install ad instructions were easy to understand even for someone who has little technical knowledge. As far as function, you wouldnt know how to answer until the fence has no power and tillthis unit was replaced or bypassed, if you fence charge still worked, this unit done its job:)"
3,"Should work just fine, but PETSAFE disables all protections on the transmitter circuitry and sells this as a solution = Scummy","Took apart my transmitter unit after a lightning strike. Circuit boards have circuitry that moderates surges. This board has the places for these protections, but they have been disabled by the company. The board is clearly labeled as to where they were supposed to be installed. PETSAFE then turns around and sells a product like this Lightning Surge Protector out of greed.The reason why these particular transmitters are so incredibly delicate is because PETSAFE has decided not to include 50 cents worth of circuitry to protect the board against surges on purpose. Scummy."
4,"Verified, it does work.","Took a nasty lighting strike on my property last week. Fried my PS3, satellite, and tripped my circuit breakers. Fence was not working, removed this unit and opened it up and oh my, it was black inside. Hooked the fence back up without the unit and it was working properly again. Still think this thing is way overpriced as simple as it is, but at least it is cheaper than replacing the transmitter unit(which I have done three times already)."
5,Not much to say really - it does it's job,"We had our system installed and running for about 8 months, but a lightning strike a block or so away put enough charge in the area to burn up the main unit. I knew this lightning protector was available, but took the gamble initially. After getting the main unit replaced I immediately ordered this and installed it in about 5 minutes. It's not designed for a GFI style outlet, as it wants to screw into the center post of the receptacle. As in most modern homes, the garage outlet in my case was a GFI - but the transformer sits nicely on the unit without using the screw, so all seems well. I haven't had another close strike yet - so I guess the jury is ultimately out still. Let's face it - it's either 5 stars cuz' it works or 1 cuz' it don't! Time will tell - but I'd recommend you pick one up."
3,DVD de mala calidad,"Mi comentario no es acerca de las pel√≠culas, puesto que quien las compra, es porque las conoce y le gustan. Mi queja es acerca de la mala calidad del DVD. Hay una escena de la primera pel√≠cula en la que se presenta una grave distorsi√≥n de la imagen durante un breve lapso. Es un defecto de la cinta magn√©tica utilizada para crear el DVD m√°ster, por lo que todos los DVDs creados a partir de √©ste presentar√°n esta falla. Uno esperar√≠a este tipo de defectos en una copia ilegal y no en una fabricada por una empresa formal. El fabricante deber√≠a de buscar y seleccionar la cinta en el mejor estado posible para convertirla a DVD y as√≠ ofrecer un producto de la mejor calidad."
1,Takes too much time,Well this game is pretty good but i thought the battles were too easy all you do is press the attack button and go get something to eat. another bad thing is the game itself. it takes so much of your spare time you have to choose whether to play the game or do stuff you actually need to do.The only good thing about this game is the enviorment. but its so laggy in most places you cant enjoy the scenery. I on behalf of most people that actually have a social life would hate this game just like me! I HATE THIS GAME!
4,FREE AO until jan 2007,search google for ao downloads and it will come up with a special download that you can use and you can play until 2007. this game is a very fun game but the lag is at times unbareable and on the free download you dont get any perks or full map. i suggest playin this until you want to buy it and get the special edition if you are really into it and hope that they patch it so there is less lag. good game tho.
5,The Best Manga Ever of Sailor Moon!,This volume includes Jupiter Dream which is about Lita and maybe not wanting to be a scout and gets a mysterious ring for free from and new herb shop. Also has Venus Dream where Mina can't transform and falls into a trap setup by the Dead Moon Circus.This volume also has the three Exam Battle Chapters with 1)Lita's Melancholy;Lita stays up late to make a dinner for the other scouts but can't study. 2)Ami's First Love;the story that was made into a movie about when Ami gets a love letter from a boy with the pen name Mercurius. 3)Mina and Raye's Girls School Battle; the funniest one ever. When Mina is jealous of Raye's all girls school where she doesn't have exams she disguises herself as a student there and causes trouble. I recommend this for all SM fans.:)
5,SM just keeps getting better and better.,"Personally I think SMSupers is a great series and it DEFINATLLY lets you in on what exactly happens when and to whom, unlike the show. Don't take me wrong, now, the shows great too, but it has also been played down in America so that it is more attractive to younger girls. My question is, why didn't they play down DBZ? Oh well, I highly recommened, if you like SM at all, to check this book, along with the rest of the series, out!"
4,Here's a good book 4 ya!,"Hey people! Looking for a good book? Or comic book to be precise! Well you just found it! I bought this book on account of i hadent read any of the serise before, but soon, i was hooked. I could NOT put it down! It had more excitement in it than the TV serise! But the best part was that it had TWO chapters FULL of my favorite character, Lita! (or Makoto) It also has a good chapter on Raye and Mina. (which is VERY funny i might add!) so in conclusion, i think everyone should buy this book today! dont wait!"
2,English version of Sailormoon? *thumbs down*,"Sorry, nothing will compare to the Japanese version. The print quality leaves something to be desired-- the grey tones aren't as smooth as the original manga, there's telltale white spots where the kanji were removed... I recommend importing the Japanese manga and getting the translations online like I did. I didn't buy this; I looked over my friend's. It's not HORRIBLE, but I would not pay for it."
1,Stick to the Original,"Yes, it may be great that Mixx has finally brought the Sailor Moon Manga to the US, but with its terrible translations and blurry picture quality, I'd just as soon it not be brought here at all. If you think the pictures are wonderful in Mixx's version, you should go buy the original somewhere and dig up a translation for it on the internet. If you want truely wonderful manga, that's translated well, stick to Viz."
2,Terrible design,"I bought this to replace my old Mr. Coffee which started leaking from the bottom. What a mistake! Using the brew pause to get a cup of coffee before the entire pot is done gets coffee all over the heater element. Those windows can be difficult to read. And the thing is impossible to clean. My previous model had black lines and numbers inside the water reservoir. The reservoir was a little wider so I could get my hand in there to wipe it out. The brew basket holder used to be removable. I could take it out for cleaning. And the pause system worked with a small lever on the back that opened and closed when the pot was put on and off the burner. I gave it 2 stars because it does make good coffee, but I can't wait to replace it with something more user friendly. I can't believe the design folks tampered with something that worked fine."
2,Not what's in picture,"I was so excited to find new figure for my son's spellcaster game. Clearly you can see the casting stone in the picture, along with everything else the figure comes with. Unfortunately, there is no casting stone. The figure does work on the spellcaster, but clearly doesn't make up for the valuable missing stone. I will hesitate to order again!"
2,Insufficient Depth,"Any creative nonfiction writer seeking a how-to approach in this book will be disappointed. It is long on extracts from other published works with comments; however, is short on specific writing techniques. Overall, after reading the book, one gets a general feel of what creative nonfiction is, not the nuts and bolts of producing it."
4,Tell It Slant,"Finally found this book after looking for it at a ton of different websites. Very cheap, came quickly. Good seller."
3,Good Non-Fiction Writing Companion,Nice companion to writing non-fiction.I think the first edition was better. It had more essays.
3,Mixes truisms with urban myth,"Jeff Ball tries to cover roses from A to Z. the tape is divided up in sections to allow you to skip to the part that are of interest to you. The blurb on the cassette cover sounds reasonable. How ever how may time are you going to rip off all the roses leaves for the winter?The program does include soil preparation, proper handling and simple maintenance tasks. It you do not take every thing he says as gospel then you may be able to extract some useful tips from this film."
2,Don't bother...,"For starters, this thing is a pain to install. I have a Volcano heatsink. After attaching the duct to the heatsink the fan is attached with long screws and tiny nuts. There's litte room to maneuver a tool or even a finger behind the fan on the short side of the duct. Getting a nut threaded onto a screw proved to be a challenge.They claim this duct reduces noise, I found the opposite to be true. While there may have been less noise caused by turbulence as they claim, the duct seemed to be vibrating, giving a whining sound. After making sure all the mounting screws were tight I tried adjusting the fan's RPM(mine is adjustable) but the vibration never went away. The whining sound was annoying enough that I didn't even take the time to test for any improvement in cooling before I removed it."
3,Fades!,"I store my Miden outside like most and was looking for a quality cover and was willing to pay extra.. At first very pleased on built quality and thickness of cover. After just one winter and summer, the cover is totally faded on one side. Very disappointing."
2,Okay at best,"I purchased this book simply because of the title. How many books will I find that have my last name as part of the title?I found the book to be okay at best. The booked jumped from place to place far too much. The author is in the pharmaceutical industry, and that really shows through in the deep details of the chemistry descriptions in the book. To those of us that are not chemists, this is way too much detail.The book has numerous typographical errors, and could have used a thorough spell check.The title character ""Roger Mencik"" plays a very small role in the story, which to me was disappointing. The connection of the title to the story is not clear until at least halfway through the book.While the story line is a good idea, a better writer could have done much more with it."
3,Paper tiger,"These are basically designed to appeal to the type of insecure male who needs to drive a Hummer or huge pickup truck to the office: a lot more quantity than QUALITY.For five hundred dollars I would recommend a much better quality pair of mini-towers like the Ascend CMT-340s (ascendacoustics.com) or Paradigm Monitor 5s which will provide far more accurate mids and highs, and when paired with a good sub like the SVS PB10, will produce ample QUALITY bass (low and tight, not muddy and loose) for both movies and music. Also, smaller speakers will not require such high-current amps to sound their best."
4,Good for experienced practictioner,"I enjoyed this book and got a lot from it, Kovitz focuses not on a standard ""join the dots"" methodology but rather on outlining an overall approach followed by good detailed advice on possible analysis/documentation techniques and how to write clear, concise requirements. Hence I would say that its best for the experienced analyst who is already familiar with the concepts and various techniques described in section 2 and knows when to use/ when not to use them. He is truthful in what he says about needing to adapt requirements style and content to what the situation needs but in some development shops you would need to be an senior analyst to be able to vary from their standards. I would recommend it for any analyst with 2+ years experience who wants to improve and polish their ability to write requirements/specifications"
5,Book for everybody who is involved in sw development,"I would recommend this book for everybody, who is involved in sw product creation. It is so CLEARLY and engagingly written, that any reader (student, business manager, programmer...) can take advantage of information. There is no 'water' in this book. You will read and almost on every page you can make a discovery: 'A-a-a... That's how we document it!' It will make clear for many people the grey area between the conception of software idea and actual sw design. Unfortunately, in (almost) all design books the technique of documenting 'what is to be done' is glossed over."
4,"Great book, but lacks examples","Although it is titled as ""Practical"", the greatest problem of this book is the difficulties to put the methods it suggests into practice. At least, an example for each problem frame, but this book has only one case study that covers the information and workpiece problem frames only. Nevertheless, this is a great book that takes a radical approach to requirements analysis. So I give it 4 stars."
2,Theoretically nice but not practical,"A nice theory approach to writing requirment specification but hard to put into practice. Good for someone already have lots of experience in writing requirement specification and need something from different views. If you are looking for a book for content and style in requirment spec, I don't think it helps. Besides, I do not like the author's keeping saying ""and so on.... so on."" Give me an example and don't say 'so on' all the times."
2,Trackball doesn't work,"If you want a cheap optical USB mouse, then this is ok. If you're getting this because you want a portable/small trackball mouse, then look elsewhere.I tried this on three different computers (with Windows XP and 2000), and as a regular optical mouse, it worked fine, but once you switched over to trackball (read the instruction manual, don't throw it away!), then all I could get out of the trackball is a short, jerky left and right motion -- it wouldn't move up and down at all! The responsiveness of the so-called '4D' scroll ball was sluggish, when I had it in standard mouse mode.If you want a trackball, I'd recommend Logitech. If you want something portable, Targus also makes one similar to this that I haven't tried yet.Good luck!"
5,Excellent,This software is what digital photographers have been waiting for...a way to get great copies of you digital photos! I love it!
4,Finally a live album!,"This CD includes most of my favorite charlatans songs including Impossible, Weirdo, and How High. Some of the songs sound a little rough but all in all it's pretty good. It was worth the high import price. If you are a true Charlatans fan, I don't think you have a choice but to buy this album."
5,Enjoyable read about the 5 famous spies,This is my favorite of about seven books I've read on Kim Philby and/or the Cambridge Five. It provided great insight into their real characters and cleared up some of the vague or uncovered areas in other books like 'My Silent War'.
2,USSR Spy Boredom,"Hoping to learn something new about Philby, Burgess and the Cambridge lads that betrayed England afterWWII, Yuri Modin's MY CAMBRIDGE FRIENDS is a major disappointment. The book reads like an editedUSSR intelligence report with all the essential information removed except the superiority of MotherRussia. Further, the translation is painfully awkward. After the chapter on Philby, the ring-leaderof the group, the book totally lacks interest."
2,Hated it!,"I LOVE Sandra Boynton. I do not like Philadelphia Chickens. Sorry! My kids think it's okay. The lyrics are clever, but the tunes aren't catchy. I don't find myself singing along or humming the tune after we stop listening to the cd. As much as I like Boynton's books, with this cd, she just laid an egg."
1,Not satisfied,"Although the music sounded good to me, it was not catchy enough for my child. It wasn't something he would go around singing on his own. He has even asked me several times, ""Is this your music or mine?"" Not as good as Mr. Richard (mrrichard.net) who is our favorite (both of us!)"
1,Missing CD #513475517016,I am very upset to order this book and it comes without the cd. Nowhere did it say it was missing the CD!!!!!Very Missleading.
5,Loved Philadelphia Chickens CD,"The Philadelphia Chickens music is fun and upbeat, with a variety of celebrity singers and kid-oriented themes. It is great for all ages, especially babies, toddlers and pre-Ks. My little toddler ""be-bops"" to the music and claps her hands. Her dad and I love the tunes, which help explain common children's feelings, questions and desires - the cookie that is out of reach, dinosaur blues, why adults are on the go all the time, wanting a new puppy... It also has funny songs like the belly button song and sounds that cows make. The CD has provided our family with hours of fun. If you like the Boynton books, you will love this CD!"
5,"This is terrific! A definite ""must have"". We love it!","We discovered this at our public library. After we listened to it just once, I immediately got online so we could have our own copy. We listen to it in the car often. The kids (ages 2 and 6) love it. You gotta get one! We recommend it."
5,Philadelphia Chickens is for everyone!,This music is enjoyed by us all. I dare you to keep your feet still while listening to this great music! Once again Boyton and Ford created a masterpiece!
3,Philadelphia Chickens,"Liking this cd is completely dependent on your taste for musicals - so my three stars is a gift because I'm not a fan. However, I bought it on a friend's recommendation and others who have heard it enjoy the music as well. Just not for me."
4,Philly Chickens,"Great item, everyone loves it. Not quite as much as Dog Train, but much more than Rhinocerous Tap."
5,Lots of Reasons to Smile,"This music will keep everyone entertained for a long time, with rock 'n roll, blues, jazz, and even a round. We usually use it in the car to keep the grandkids happy, but we sing along to the catchy tunes, too. Who can resist a love ballad to chocolate chip cookies, or an ode to belly buttons sung in a round? And there's nothing like dancing the Swing with a baby (or toddler or even a 10-year-old) to ""Philadelphia Chickens"". The giggles are priceless. ""BusyBusyBusy"" reminds us not to take life too seriously, if the other songs don't manage to bring a smile to your face. Sandra Boynton is absolutely amazing!"
1,Dull,"This was a gift and we have listened to it only a few times because no one in the family thinks much of it. We have a lot of great kids CDs--e.g, Buzz Buzz Buzz (Laurie Berkner), Dan Zanes, Ralph's World, Trout Fishing in America--but there is nothing much compelling about the music here to hook you."
5,This is why I read book reviews!,I bought this based on reading other's reviews. I can't begin to tell you how many things I purchase off Amazon simply from following other peopple's listmania lists or recommendations. All my kids love this so much we have one for the car and one for the house. My 9 year old loves it just as much as my 1 year old.
5,Spectacular family music,"This is the best music CD for families I've ever found. The music is fun, mostly swing-influenced, and subtly funny. My 4-year-old son constantly requests to hear ""Figadebby Chickens"", even though he has to hear ""Cows"" first for his life to be complete. He sings along to every song, dances when we're at home, and generally loves it. My 1-year-old bounces up and down and cackles while he listens and watches his big brother.I sing ""Snuggle Puppy"" to the baby as I put him to sleep. I tell every family I know about Philadelphia Chickens, just because I love it so much. It has actually spurred an interest in music in my older son. I can't give it higher praise than that...."
5,COWS!,Absolutely one of the best gifts we got for our toddler. Long car rides can be fun if you sing Cows! The lyric and music are terrific. Adults like it as much as kids. Any office worker can relate to Kevin Kline's song. Even Grandpa played it in the car without the grandkids. Just happy good fun!
5,Great for parents as well as kids,"My brother-in-law and wife gave this to our ten month old daughter. She enjoys listening to it, and really enjoys listening to her mom and dad sing and dance along to the music. This really is enjoyable for parents as well as kids. Our personal favorite is snuggle puppy."
5,Oh what fun!,"We absolutely love this book and CD! My nine-month old son thinks that it is the best thing since sliced bananas! We bought it for a road trip when he was five-months old and we have been dancing and singing ever since. If this becomes a traveling musical, we are there. My husband and myself find ourselves singing and dancing along while our son enjoys the show from his high chair. He has his favorites, ""Cows"", ""Philadelphia Chickens"" and ""Pajama Time"" but truly loves the entire CD. Sandra Boynton has always been a favorite of ours, with her whimsical cards and books, but this takes the cake. She and Michael Ford, as well as the performers, have created a masterpiece to be enjoyed by all."
4,Very Cute,"We really like some of the songs. ""Faraway Cookie"" is hilarious, and we have loved ""Snuggle Puppy"" for awhile since we bought it in book form for Father's Day. My daughter is 8 months old, so the CD was really more for my husband and I right now than for her. I ordered it hoping that we could work it into out in-car rotation of CD's, but small doses of this one are better. She likes it, and I think she will love it when she gets older. Preschoolers would most likely love it! Right now, many of the songs are a little annoying for us."
5,We love the CD!!! (but the book's binding is crappy),"The CD is wonderful. It has become the top car request now...and we like it almost as much as our daughter, who just turned 4. The range of musical styles, and the amusing lyrics make it a true winner.My daughter loves having the book to go with the CD, and can study the illustrations, turning the pages with each song, for an hour at a time during long car trips.Unfortunately, despite her fairly gentle treatment of the book, the pages all started falling out during the first hour of a 4 hour road trip last weekend. Somehow we got the book away from her without a meltdown! We have owned the book for less than a month, and are very disappointed with the binding.Buy the book and CD anyway -- you can always tape the pages back in (my next task)!"
5,Fantastic for adults as well as children!,"I know it says childrens review, yet I just can't let this book/cd go by without saying ""Finally"" a book/cd I can enjoy with my 6 yr. old grand daughter. I bought it after hearing Philidephia Chickens on the Early Show. My daughter, grand daughter and I (age65) couln't stop laughing, singing and dancing while listening to it. The songs are so cute; Be Like a Duck had us dancing around the kitchen. Love Pig Island. Faraway Cookies really had us laughing and then there is Snuggle Puppy. I could go on and on. Great, great, great."
3,"Decent, but there's better","The highlight of this book is that it comes with a c.d that has about 17 questions for each section in the book to test yourself.This book is pretty much an outline of your med surg book. I recommend and prefer med surg reviews and rationales, b/c it has more info. Also the med surg made incredibly easy CD,NOT THE BOOK has ALL the questions that this cd has and more, up to 200 questions for each section as oppose to the 17 this cd has. So instead get the incredibly easy cd and reviews and rationales book."
3,BOOK DEFICIT!!!,"RECEIVED BOOK IN ADEQUATE AMOUNT OF TIME AND IN EXCELLENT CONDITION.HOWEVER,I WAS DISAPPOINTED, AS I FOUND THIS BOOK TO BE LACKING IN SPECIFIC DETAILS REGARDIND DISEASES,INTERVENTIONS AND RATIONALES."
2,There are better study guides,"I bought this book because it had a CD-ROM with NCLEX-type questions. Unfortunately, the CD-ROM can't be used on computers without Windows 98 or higher. I took the disk to my college library, hoping to use the disk on one of the PC machines there, but I discovered that the disk has to be installed on the computer. Installing software on public computers is verboten at my school. This means the CD-ROM is basically worthless to me. The book itself is basically an outline of a Med-Surg nursing textbook. There are surprisingly few illustrations for a study guide.Bottom line: If you like studying dry lists and you own a PC with Windows 98 or higher, Pentium 166 or higher, 64 MB RAM or more, and 8 MB of free hard-disk space, this book might be for you. However, if you like studying with memory aids, graphs, charts, drawings, and spoon-feeding explanations of complex concepts, don't waste your money on this book."
1,Not Very Factual,"After the gun ban in England the UK police changed their system for recording crime. This made it falsely appear that the crime rate had gone up according to statistics based on police reports. The British Crime Survey, another measure of crime in the UK, was unaffected by these changes in recording crime. According to the British Crime Survey, crime in Britain has actually gone down quite a bit since the gun ban. This is not to say that the gun ban caused the decrease in crime. A decrease in crime can be caused by other factors. However, it does reveal that the author failed to sufficiently research the topic."
1,"A little of this, a little of that.","If you want to learn about pugs, read this book, and then go out and buy another book about pugs.""The Essential Pug"" is a hodgepodge of little bits of information, most of it not specific to pugs.The chapter ""On Good Behavior"" takes a lot of time to tell you basically nothing. But the author of the chapter seems to agree with me that you need to look to other sources: ""Find out all you can about your chosen breed first [the book is supposed to be for pug owners], then master rudimentary training and handling skills.""No kidding.Only a few sections are really about pugs. Other places plugged the name ""pug"" into pre-existing material. But a lot of places they didn't even bother with that. ""...your chosen breed."""
5,Excellent Pattern Collection,"Large collection of great patterns. A good way to get a lot of reward for a minimal amount of investment in terms of tools and materials. I have as much fun making them as the kids do playing with them. A decent range of patterns from simple shape/alphabet/number puzzles to more intricate circus scenes and map of USA, etc."
3,Good small child patterns,Very simple easy patterns for small children. Will save these for the summer when I need to entertain the grandkids.
2,Tepid barley flavor disappointed,"I really enjoy the natural decaf property of barley tea. I normally use whole barley at home but needed bags for the office. I had brought some back from China on my last trip that I could not find in the US, so I tried this brand. These large bags are actually for a teapot, not a cup as I expected. As mentioned, the flavor was not full-bodied and so I will keep searching."
2,More than it's worth,"I first began using the roasted barley to make a beverage almost thirty years ago while learning Hapkido. It is good for the heart, stabilizes the pancreas, and works as a fat emulsifier. It goes well with roasted corn to make an even more healthful drink. I would suggest buying it from a local Korean, Chinese or Japanese market. I just got 4 bags of roasted corn and the roasted barley for less than $9. Then you can either brew it whole on the stove, or grind it and brew it in a French Press. Both ways work well. Adding sugar or honey diminishes some of the health benefits. In spring and summer I have it at room temperature. If it is cold outside I drink it warm. Either way is great. Try 4 tablespoons to a quart of water."
1,weak barley flavor,This tea was a disappointment. The tea had a weak barley flavor no matter how many tea bags were used. I do not believe this tea was very fresh. I will try another variety.
3,okay ....,not as good as the one I had before... doesn't really have the flavor of barley .... ...But generally it's okay
3,Where's Innocent Child?,"This collection is good, but it's missing Innocent Child - the third best song Mick Jones ever sang (after Lost in the Supermarket and Stay Free)."
5,good mix of old tracks,"Mick is a massive talent,real decent tracks that have been improved upon,worth buying even if you have got the tracks already"
4,Sci-Fi/Fantasy with a hint of S&M - one of ComicsOne's best!,"All of the Sarai books are well written and the art issecond to none. Although the notion of a ""warrior maid""is a bit odd, the entire post-apocolyptic world is asunique as any manga/comic fan could hope for. Shibatahas created a rich setting with interesting charactersand many thought-provoking stories. Truly one of thebest Japanese graphic novels I've encountered becauseof the quality and originality of both the art andwriting. One word of caution: although this is not apornographic/hentai title, it is violent and sexuallycharged. Aged 17+ only for this one."
1,arcane,Not accessible at all for someone who wants to learn Latin. This is obviously very old and from a different age and style of learning.
5,the best French techno-pop,"I first knew about Etienne Daho when I heard him sing Quelq Un Qui m'Ressemble together with Sylvie Vartan and Francoise Hardy in the Sylvie Vartan's CD ""Irr√©sistiblement Sylvie"". I got inmediately interested in the song and in his voice. Since then I've bought 5 CDs by Daho. I can say he's the best to perform French techno-pop (as in this CD), his voice sounds also very nice in beautiful ballads that appear most of all in other, more recent, CDs as Paris Ailleurs or Corps et Armes. I enjoy that in all of them the songs are fully orchestrated and have fine arrangements."
2,NOT a good buy at all,"This product is no bigger than the palm of your hand...if you are a beginner then this is not the one for you,,,it is too small to do anything on"
4,double is better,"Good size as practice pad, being double sided is better with different tension for practice.Looks like it will last me a long time.Not too heavy and well portable.Thumbs up."
4,It's 2001 and still no new Sinti/Rosenberg!,"The reviews below nail it. The musical virtuosity, warmth, playfulness and otherworldly beauty of Sinti's recording are all here. This disc held tremendous promise to music fans everywhere that the spirit of Django lived on but it has been awfully quite ever since. Undoubtedly, Sony dropped them after they failed to become the next Gypsy Kings. Jimmy where are you!?!?!?!?! If you don't own it, and you have even the slightest interest, snap it up now!"
2,Unusual viewpoints,"The author has written a few chapters from unusual, non-traditional fishing story viewpoints. If his purpose was to move his readers from their comfort zone, he succeeded."
5,B & M Short / Sport Shifter,"This isn't the first time I've bought this product. I have bought many B&M; products in the past. If I bought another brand of shifter it generally made noise and ultimately I'd return the product or have to repurchase a replacement it with a B&M; shifter due to my mistake.Many short/sport shifters make noise and they forwarn you that you might experience extra noise due to it's performance characteristics.Fortunately, that is not the case with the three or four shifters I've bought from B&M.;The action on this shifter for my Corvette is short and very percise. No bad things to say about it.So, imo you don't want to save a buck on this type of item. Purchase the best buy the B&M; product if at all possible. You'll be much happier with it."
5,Great Helmet,"Great helmet. Looks slick, light weight at 1/3 the cost of the CF version...go with this one and use the $200 savings to invest in some quality components for your bike. Fits great, I have a long head and the padding conforms wonderfully. I haven't taken any major knocks on it, but am comfortable that it will do the trick when called upon. The visor is strong, not flimsly like some other brands. If you are on the fence go ahead and pull the trigger, you wont be sorry. I bought the Matte black, its SICK!"
5,Great helmet,"Awesome helmet! Was deciding whether to get the Small or Mediums since my head is 57cm. I went with medium and it fits so well, I've never had a more comfortable helmet! And I have had a lot of them, it is very well ventilated and so snug. Since small is 54-56cm and medium is 57-59cm I was worried it would be lose! But not at all and I even slapped a gopro side mount on it and the helmet sits still on my head. For the price, you just can't beat it."
5,Downhillin just got better 1.O,"This Giro Remedy Full Face helemt offers great sizing, comfort, vision in a item that is well over $130 in other retail shops. A great buy, at a great price point."
5,Giro Helmet,This helmet is really great and breaths well. Fits really good. Looks good too..I like it.bike helmet
5,great look and very comfortable,This is the most comfortable helmet I ever had (including motocross helmets). I also like the look of it. One small problem with this one though - the liner is a bit worm (at least here in the summer where we have 30 deg C). Also vision from the helmet is great - you don't have anything in your line of vision. I would like it to have D rings and not the quick release though but this is a personal preference. The price I got from Amazon was great and I got it in just 2 days with free shipment which is also great
3,average helmet - good for the price,"saved my head several times with only cosmetic scraping on shell.padding still feels great after almost 2 years riding.medium size arrived much tighter than the one measured at LBS, and took quite a few rides until it ""opened up"" and became comfortable. it's now a perfect fit and does not wiggle around.too few vent holes for hot weather, but i knew this when i ordered.chin strap clip not the best ever - would have preferred D-rings system.average weight."
2,Bitter!,"The item gets two stars simply because I figure my problem with it might just be a fluke. I love the mocha flavor item, so tried this. After one sip I poured the coffee down the sink because it tasted so awful - bitter and strongly chemical. Maybe there is something wrong with the batch I got?... At any rate, I'll just stick with the hazelnut creamer and Green Mountain Hazelnut bold k-cups for the flavor I love. So disappointed."
5,splenda NO calorie sweetener....hazelnut,"Excellent in your coffee, great flavor, not too strong and sugar free...you can`t ask for more!!! I highly recommend to anyone using artificial sweeteners."
1,The Hazelnut Flavor is AWFUL!,"I really like Splenda, but this Hazelnut flavor has a distinctly over-chemicaled taste and just doesn't have much nuttiness to it. Perhaps the other flavors are better."
4,Mocha is best,"This is a pretty good Splenda flavor, but the Mocha is best, in my opinion. The French Vanilla is a second favorite. Hazelnut is better than no flavor at all. I use one flavored packet and one regular Splenda packet in a large (14 oz) mug, and it's perfect. Not necessary to use two flavored ones, as it is a little pricey and one has enough flavor for an entire travel mug."
5,a Great Flavor Enhancer,"My husband loves the taste of hazelnut in his coffee. Splenda flavored sweetners give him that wonderful flavor without the calories! When our grocery store discontinued them, I was delighted that Amazon had them. It is also a good bargain and helps to maintain my husband's ""sweet"" disposition."
3,At least it's quick,"I am not sure if I'd actually want to describe it as 'bitter', but I decided to purchase this product because I make coffee using milk. But then if I want a sugared cup, I would still usually have to add sugar and flavoring. So I principally bought this product just to forgo steps in the process.And the packets also seemed to provide convienience for me.But, I would like a stronger hazelnut flavor. Right now, it seems to be very sugary, so people drinking this product might not always detect if they are using flavoring at all. And this actually negates the point of producing the specific product. It would be better to just buy a can of regular sugar plus a bottle of syrup.Still, the product is edible and affordable in the markets where it is for sale. I am able to successfully drink the cups which I've made. And the individual serviving sizes are convienient. So it's not the worst thing which is produced on the market. It's just not the premiere accessory for coffee consumption."
4,Wish I could order less at one time,"The product is great, it came on time, I enjoy using it -- but I think it would be fresher if I could order three months' worth of one cup a day, instead of six! If I use one a day, this 30x6 pack will last for six months..."
5,Just right for me.,"I use artificial sweeteners in my ""gotta-have"" 2 cups of morning coffee. And love this particular flavor of coffee. The small, packets are easy to throw in the purse if going out for coffee. Tastes very good. Also, feel the price is good. I like being able to stock up with 6 boxes of 30 @ in a box, too."
5,Splenda coffee flavors,I cannot get this product at the grocery store any more so I was very happy to see that Amazon had it. I will continue to purchase it from Amazon.
3,Album for Englishmen to listen to,"Although this compilation gathers some fine, elegant Bossa Nova masterpieces, all I could think when I first heard it was: ""Hey, this CD is for Englishmen to listen to"" - that is, it is ""Export-only"" !"
5,My toddler loves this book!,"We got this book at the library and my 17 month old toddler wants me to read it again and again...and again (for about two weeks now). I will read this book and then try to read another one of his favorites next, but he will push it away. I am not sure if it is the vibrant pictures or the great flow of text, but it doesn't really matter...think I might have to break down and buy the book now."
4,I love a good series,"Cherry Adair is Fun!I really did like the book, but the character development did not happen to the end. But I don't read a romance to analyze I read to have fun (couldn't find anything to rhythm with analyze) but anyway I was a good fun book but I can't wait for Kane in Egypt. Its going to be sexy."
3,In Too Deep,Sex was great story line weak and too much action for one person. The Lt. history was very short and not enough details. Out of the 4 books written by Ms. Adair this one was my least enjoyed one.
4,"Steamy, Fast Paced, and Fun","This is book three in a series by Ms. Adair and just like her previous books the storyline is fun, the characters are likable and quirky (like Tally's need to sing off key when she is scared), and the story is still very sexy.This is the older Wright brother's story. Each story stands on it's own so you will not have had to have read the previous two titles (Kiss and Tell and Hide and Seek). A fun way to spend the weekend and I look forward to other titles by this talented author."
2,On Thin Ice was sooooo much better,"After enjoying On Thin Ice so much, I really hate to do this but In Too Deep wasn't nearly as entertaining. I didn't see the chemistry between Michael and Tally. The entire book centered around their sexual encounters. Neither of them had much depth, the plot was slippery and the writing choppy. Tally was just a little too brave for me when faced with life-threatening situations on nearly every page and I kept getting the feeling that she was just a young, little girl with the way she talked and thought. It just wasn't as deep as it should have been and there were a lot of goofy phrases. However, I haven't given up yet. I still have more of her books to read."
3,A disappointment,"I was hoping for more from this book because I liked Kiss and Tell, but it was much more like Hide and Seek, which I wound up skimming. I guess I just like more romance in my romances and not so much action."
2,Ehhhhh...it was ok,I've read some of Cherry Adair's other books and I liked them alot better than this one. I just couldn't get into the story. The fact that the guy in the story had an eye patch was just a little bit too weird for me.
2,Not a Keeper,"This is a book with major problems: the characterizations are shallow and the plot line thin. Add to that an unsympathetic hero and a trite story line. The romantic scenes are hot, but not especially original. And the inconsistent elements abound.I really enjoyed HIDE AND SEEK. I did not enjoy IN TOO DEEP."
2,deeply dull,"I couldn't like Tally at all. I don't know what authors are thinking about making their heroines bumbling or witchy fools. Falling all over the place in the middle of a storm, nearly tearing his shorts off twice, and her awful singing really destroy the suspenseful atmosphere the author was rally struggling (and usually failing) to create.Essentially, we don't like Tally, so we really don't care what happens to her and the hero deserves better. But even he gets wearing after a while. Everything else is down hill from the first 40 pages on. The love scenes have all been done so much better elsewhere. A big yawn. The only thing deep about this book is how far it will put you to sleep."
1,A Disappointment !!,"I have to say I was terribly disappointed in this book. I loved the first two books in the series and would give them 5 stars each. But this one I finally just gave up on and didn't even finish. I had really been looking forward to getting it......but after 5 or 6 chapters, I just decided that I'd rather spend my reading time on something that grabbed me....which this did not. I hope her next book is more of the caliber of the first two books Hide & Seek and Kiss & Tell."
1,Never received item,"The photo is lovely. I wouldn't know about the product, I was sent two old chests that looked like they should have gone in the fireplace instead of this one. Had to return the whole mess. What a bother."
2,Lack of color pictures made this book dissapointing.,"I was buiding a model of the He111 when I purchased this book. I was looking for a different camouflage scheme than the one pictured in the kit, and thougth this book would be useful in that pursuit. Unfortunately all the pictures where in black & white. So, if for whatever reason, you're looking for color pictures of Axis bombers, stay away from this book. If you're research is much broader, then this book may satisfy your needs."
2,Not what I hoped for,"I ordered ""No Hitting!"" through my son's scholastic pamphlet, and this was not what I hoped for. My 20 month old son likes the baby pictures, but as stated by other reviewers, the text is bizarre, often irrelevant and difficult for my little one to understand. ""We don't squeeze the cat, but we can squeeze playdough."" I was hoping to teach him not to hit, instead I have to make up the words when he wants to read this. I will be throwing it away as soon as ""Hands are Not for Hitting"" arrives. My older son used that book in his pre-school with great results."
4,Not bad,The book was ok. I didn't like that the flaps were full page and open up towards the top of the book. I also wished it would have expanded more on the not hitting.
2,Not Too Helpful,"First off, I love Karen Katz's books. But I must agree with the negative reviews on this one. This book does not address hitting except on the first page, and the alternatives are rather strange. Also, for the part about not sticking your tongue out, why is the mother taunting her child with a lollypop?"
3,"Doesn't really focus on ""no hitting""","The cover and the first page cover ""no hitting"" and the rest is about no pushing, no spitting, no whatever. I'd recommend Hands Are Not For Hitting if you have issues with hitting. This book doesn't really do it."
2,Mediocre,"This book is not that great. It's short and doesn't address common issues. It says things like ""don't squeeze the cat"". It's very thin & easily can be torn."
3,Examples are a little odd,I agree with the reviewer that found it odd that one of the examples in the book suggested that instead of sticking out your tongue you should lick an ice cream cone. ?? The examples were a little strange and the book isn't completely focused on hitting.A friend of mine owns another book on hitting calledHands Are Not for Hitting by Martine Agassi Ph.D. I recommend that book as a little more on target for those focused on correcting a hitting issue.
3,Not as Good,"This book is true to form, beautiful colored images that young children love to look at, but the story is weird. It talks about how to deal with frustration other than through hitting. However the advice didn't really make sense...the author writes that instead of sticking your tongue out at someone, stick your tongue and lick an ice cream cone instead....????? I didn't get it, and I didn't want my kids expecting me to give them ice cream everytime they got angry!Her other books like Where is Mommy and Wiggle Your Toes are better."
2,"I like a lot of Katz's books, but not this one",I wish I'd checked this one out in a store and not ordered online. I don't care for the wording or suggestions- I find it overly cute and dread when daughter wants to read it.
1,No Hitting=Hitting,"Little kids and babies don't understand the word ""don't"" or ""no."" Therefore, this book is a litany of ""I'm mad. I'm going to hit."" Has opposite effect of intended.Plus, it's OK to jump up and down and scream sometimes."
3,The author failed to properly research his subject.,"For those readers not familiar with Kern County, its history or its citizens, this book will serve as an overview and introduction to ""KC"" as it was called. However, those of us who are natives of Bakersfield and Kern County who have had generations of family members attend this institution, this book is most notable from the information left out or missed. It also appears that the author suffered from selective and incomplete research or memory when identifying many years of successful graduates that later became community leaders. I found this book to be a disappointment. The photographs are excellent however."
1,If You're Made of Money - This One's For Your,"Distressed starlets, wives of millionaires, models, this is the book for you. You will be treated to in-depth patient profiles of women with too much time on their hands and too much money to know what to do with. If you're looking for practical skincare advise for us mere mortals, pass on this book. The only redeeming feature was her description of the form and function of the skin, which was quite detailed, yet easy to comprehend. But overall, just don't go there - unless you're a starlet."
1,"A Boring, Preachy Read","I can't believe this woman is a dermatologist. She is complicated, dictating, and will cost you money and time if you take her advice. Save your money."
2,contains some basic info,"I purchased this book hoping that this would contain basic skin care info, and additional info regarding various skin treatments. I found the info on the light side, and the philosophy that we all have inner beauty not something I wanted. I bought this specifically to find information on skin peels, and PSR. I did not find this information adequate enough go make a solid judgement with. Go to your public library for this one."
4,in the know at any age,"I read this book just before a session wirh my dermatologist and it helped focus our discussion tremendously. I knew specific questions to ask, knew specific brand names and their potential side effects. Also it was most helpful to finally have a list of brand name cosmetics, soaps and creams that the good doctor uses and recommends...not as a paid spokesperson but as a skin specialist and consumer. A great reference guide for any woman, any age."
1,Don't bother!,"I ordered this video in hopes of supplementing childbirth classes. It was not in my best interest to listen to ""Hollywood Stars"" like John Ritter, Kenny Rogers, and Lorenzo Lamas talking about ""natural childbirth"" when they aren't even carrying the child."
3,Very good book,"It's a pity the editorial opinion doesn't match the general positivity of the customer reviews! I personally felt this was a very GOOD story. Well laid out. I can't really tell about the story, because most of the thrill of reading Daphne du M's work is figuring it out as you go, piecing together the bits and coming out with a peculiar and always wonderful ending. She had to be the master of endings. Anyway, this is a good story. I got it from the library while I was working last year and took it along sometimes to read between breaks and at lunch and stuff. I loved the way that all along you felt as if the book was heading toward one thing... then that was suddenly resolved and it went in a somewhat different direction. I recommend it highly."
1,"Dreary, Dull, and Depressing","I looked forward to this book, as I loved ""Rebecca"" and ""Jamaica Inn."" Sorry to say, this was one of those books that I thought would never end. I kept hoping page after page that it would get better. I did not care for any of the characters, nor what they were doing. The plot was contrived and dull. If I ever write a book, I hope it holds my interest more than this one did!"
2,Disappointing!,"This is the first novel by DuMaurier that I didn't finish! I loved all of her other books that I have read, but ..... I would not recommend this one...."
2,Not useful for a graduate level thesis,"This book may be useful for someone writing their first high school or undergraduate paper, but is not going to be useful to someone writing a graduate level thesis.This book covers basic research methods (like how to find a book in a card catalog), directions on note taking, and a good portion of the book is devoted to citing resources and quotations in MLA and Chicago documentation styles. If you have had an academic background that required a lot of writing none of this information is going to be new to you. Additionally, these documentation styles can be freely researched on the internet for a quick refresher.This book is also quite dated, pointing out that the final manuscript should be typed and not handwritten, and advises ""The typewriter should be in good working order. The ribbon should retain a sufficient amount of ink for a uniformly clear imprint..."" Surprising, considering this book's most recent edition was published in 2003.Save your money."
2,Can't blame anyone but Sony.,"This 3rd party accessory is in expensive so you should probally get it. However after a while, the plastic pins are going to bend and it's painful to charge. I don't the problem is with this product but with the plug design. So even if you get the original accessory, it's problly going to do the same thing again. The fact that you're shopping for one proves that your original is probally out of whack. So should you get it? Yes. All i know is that when my phone dies, i'm switching to another brand because of this.... but that's just me."
3,Fast Shipping and Good Quality and Very Cheap Price,Fast Shipping and Good Quality and Very Cheap Price.. i am pretty feeling good with it..
1,Guess I got what I paid for!,"This car charger failed to work at all. It was the correct device for my phone and in a brand new car with three different power source outlets, none of them fit this charger such that all the contacts were made...I guess the 99cent price should have been a give away... 1 star is one too many!"
4,"A pair of small jbl E-30 speakers..People will be looking fort the large speakers,with excellent sound.","The jbl E30,offers big sound in a small two-way bookshelf configeration...The sound is full warm,and a little bright..These lively little jbl speakers really make the cut...Buy a double pair,and a good sub,and you are really cooking with gas...After hearing these,i bought a pair of these as a christmas gift for friends...I believe these speakers are top notch,and i highly recommend these to anyone with limited space,looking for a good set of speakers."
5,"Small size, Killer sound","After doing quite a bit of online research for a pair of front speakers for my new home theatre room, I decided on the JBL Northridge E30 bookshelf speaker and was not disappointed. I have two rather large front surround stands and these speakers barely fit on them so they are by no stretch of the imagination ""small.""I've been running a pair of Bose 10.2 floor standing bass reflex speakers and can honesty say that these JBL's more than hold their own against them. I can't speak strictly fir audio in the form of music but for front surrounds in a home theatre, these babies are jaw droppers. Rich, deep bass, superb highs and outstanding clarity and the hallmarks here and if you are looking for a pair of reasonably priced speakers which are capable of delivering top drawer sound, try them. You will not be sorry."
5,A must have for Dutch music fans,"Music by Acda en de Munnik shaped an era for me. Greaty vocals, sharp lyrics and good tunes characterize these two talents. If you want to get Holland in the 1990ties in your house, buy this album!"
4,Recommended even for English-speakers,"I received this CD from a Dutch friend and, despite the fact that my Dutch is feeble at best, I have found it to be easy on the ears. Think of Lowen and Navarro meet Hootie and the Blowfish, transported to Amsterdam in the 1990's. Voices that sound great together and that are not drowned out by the music. Even if you can't understand a word of Dutch, the quality of the music and the singing will keep you coming back for more."
1,No cordless devices / Rude Tech support,"I bought this device and hooked up 2 PCs to one Logitech USB cordless mouse and one Logitech cordless keyboard. Didn't work at all. I called tech support and met 2 of the rudest support people ever. They were like the rude people in commercials that make fun of rude cust svc/tech support people. You wouldn't believe how rude the last guy was. If only I had room here to tell you. ALSO - Their product doesn't work with cordless mice and keyboards, esp if your device has extra buttons with special functionality. To use their terms: ""We don't support cordless devices"". STAY AWAY ! PS: If you manage to get the ""real"" supervisor, he is friendly and tries to help."
1,WORST product I have ever purchased,"This thing is unbelievably BAD.I have to reboot it at least twice a day, it either locks up or causes the mouse to shoot off in one direction. Only way to resolve is to unplug.IOGEAR offer no Firmware update either.AVOID at all cost!"
1,"OSD unfriendly, Doesn't know Microsoft wireless mice",I requested a better switch at work but was given this. The on screen display is difficult to use (four keystrokes including F1 or F4 just to switch) and it completely blocks recognition of Microsoft wireless mice. Recommend their Extreme products or a different manufacturer.
1,Will not work with backlit keyboards,Pros: Neat idea.Cons: Will not work with my backlit Saitek keyboard. It actually doesn't work at all and this is the second unit I've received from IOGear. I can't switch between computers with hotkeys or the manually with the buttons. Tech support is pretty much useless because they will tell you to try autoscanning and if that doesn't work then they'll want you to return it for a replacement. I'm sorry but if they can't ship a working product then I'm not going to waste my time being their QA for free. I was able to get out of tech support that there isn't enough power coming out of the front USB ports to power a backlit keyboard even when the KVM switch is plugged in.Good luck to anyone that buys this product.
2,Repairing musical boxes,"It has been a long time ago, but I do remember reading it and realizing I waisted time and money, maybe because my problem was not even mention in the book, it is a small booklet and it has limited information but it could perfect for someone else."
3,Not as good as original filter,"This filter isn't as good as the original filter it replaced. When I first bought the air purifier, it did a fantastic job of absorbing odor from the litter box. Now that the original filter is gone and I am using this replacement, there are times when the odor can overwhelm its capabilities.I suspect it has something to do with the use of (more?) baking soda in the original filter. I have no idea if the replacement uses any.Secondly, these filters are exceedingly difficult to find. Because none of the local retailers carry it anymore -- including the store that sold me the air purifier -- I have to buy it online.Lastly, this filter is darned expensive!The moral of the story: If you're buying an air purifier, make sure the filters are easily replaceable and at a reasonable price."
2,Only for hardcore fans,"I used to be an absolute fan of Philip Bailey's, and this is the first record that actually put me off him. Starting with this one album, Philip's career, singing and choice of material went downslope.His best Christian album was also the first one ""The Wonders Of His Love"" (1984), followed by ""Triumph"" (1986), which was almost as good. This doesn't live up to the other two, unfortunately. As for his secular, mainstream albums, ""Chinese Wall"" (1984)and even ""Inside Out"" (1986) are great albums, and even the 1983 debut album ""Continuation"" (never made available on CD) had its moments, but these go back quite a bit now!Nowadays, Philip Bailey has lost the brilliancy of his early performances. Even his work with Earth Wind & Fire doesn't live up to his early days with the band. Yet, anything is better than this record, so if you want to buy it, buy it only for the sake of completion (and pray that his rarer albums be made available on CD at last!)"
5,Insightful !,"This book easily assists the student and the scholar in a better understanding of the emergence of the hospital in history. To be enjoyed in the comfort of one's favorite armchair. The reading community can look forward with anticipation to his latest contribution, The Orphans of Byzantium."
3,Exactly what it is,I thought it was a good buy since it was only four bucks. Explains the different parts of the mass and how you are to respond. however I was really hoping that it would have the readings for Sunday mass so my daughter could follow step by step. I had to buy a separate book for the readings and I think that this book is solely useful if you want to use as an intro to what happens at mass.
1,Don't buy this cartridge!,"And here are two good reasons why I titled this review the way I did:1. The cartridge leaked in the bag.2. The cartridge didn't even fit my Epson Photo EX (though the compatibility number is correct).While their b&w cartridge works fine, I'd go with Epson original color cartridge."
2,Dataproducts Compatible Cartridge,This ink was noticably lighter than the original Epson ink on photographs. It worked OK for regular printing but clogged often. This caused me to use more of the ink due to cleaning. I would spend the extra money for the Epson ink because the photos are much better.
2,Don't bother...save your money.,I wasted more money in ink and photo paper with clogged heads than I did in actual printing. Poor color rendition and way too many head clogs for me. Save your money and buy the real Epson cartridge or search for another manufacuter.
1,Limited,"This book says nothing about the most fascinating unconscious activity of all: that related to creative acts like writing poetry,"
1,"Be advised, Avalon Organics has changed their formula","I have used Avalon Organics shampoos and conditioners in the past year, LOVED them, but stopped because I find them a bit pricey. I recently purchased the same 2 shampoos and 2 conditioners I've used in the past and they are HORRIBLE!!! After just one use, my hair is so dry and brittle and I have long, very healthy hair. I can not even run a comb through my hair with the conditioner in. I am so disappointed in these products and with the company. I called Avalon Organics directly and asked if they changed their ingredients and was told that yes, they have changed the formulas in their shampoos and conditioners. This was not advertised on the bottles. I was offered coupons but no refund. I no longer would recommend purchasing Avalon Organics products."
2,No thanks,"I love the SMELL of this shampoo, but that's all I love. After using this daily for a month, I found that my scalp was developing patches of oily crust - using the same technique for shampooing that I always use. I was glad when it was gone and won't buy it again."
3,"Leaking bottles, sticky mess","Shampoos from amazon usually arrive with leakage & loose caps. I really wish they could solve this problem. This shampoo smells good, cleans well & isn't harsh. There's always the risk that leakage will eliminate cost savings."
2,"Didn't work for long, thick hair.","I bought this shampoo to try as a natural alternative to the more chemical-laden brands. I have waist-length, thick, wavy hair. I found myself having to shampoo my hair two or three times to make it feel and look as clean as with my previous natural shampoo (Burt's Bee's)after one wash. I tend to shampoo 2-3 times a week as we live in a low-water area. I do not have coarse hair or greasy scalp. The shampoo also started to develop a strange odor after about six weeks. However, the lemon helped to brighten my naturally blond locks and until it went bad, has a wonderfully fresh scent."
3,"Nice smelling shampoo, but a bit dying","I only wash my hair with non sulfate shampoos, so I wanted to give Avalon Organics a try. The shampoo has a strong lavender smell. Not the sweetened watered down type either, but the smell of lavender essential oil. It lathers up very nice. It doesn't have tons of suds like sulfate shampoos, but suds do not equal clean. I feel that this shampoo suds up perfectly without overdoing it.Overall, my hair feels clean, but not as soft as with other shampoos. I am using the conditioner that goes with this (a little bit goes a long way, too). While I do not dislike this product, it is a bit too drying for my hair. I wash daily and need something a little more moisturizing. I will probably give their other shampoos a try."
5,Great for fine oily hair,My cousin and I started using this product for its all natural ingredients. We have both have allot of fine oily hair and this shampoo keeps the oils at bay and works nice with our hair styles.
2,Scarecrow Hair!,"The smell is wonderful, until you use it. Hard to lather and work through hair. Almost feels like it is pulling hair out rather than washing it. After rinsing hair feels like straw. Dry straw hay. Terrible. Don't recommend."
2,Smells nice but made my hair feel like straw,"I wanted to like this. The 1st time I used it, it was ok but the more I used it the worse my hair got. I have normal straight fine hair and live in Colorado so I need some moisturizing but not a lot. The seriously dried my hair out. My scalp itched a little so I stopped using it."
4,"easy setup, nice case, but slow","The drive is extremely easy to set up. No drivers need to be installed for Windows 2000 or XP. The drive also comes in a nice padded case where you can store the drive, cables and a few CDs.The drive can he a little quarkey. Occasionally it has locked up and required that I unplug the USB from the PC. Copying large amounts of data is kinda slow"
5,Better than a Zip Drive!,"The simpledrive usb external hard drive is perfect for holding all of your data. Including mp3 music, pictures, word docs, excel docs, powerpoints and more, or just use it to backup files from your computer's internal hard drive. Easily attaches to any USB port and it is extremely portable. Even comes with its own carrying case! Had a zip drive, but dumped it for this product. NO MORE DISKS!!! I love it.- Recovering Zip Drive Owner"
2,Too Slow to Keep Up WIth Large File Copies,"I purchased this drive to serve as a backup to my digital photo collection. The drive consistently hung up my computer with write errors, at different stages of the copy from my internal hard disk. I tried both DOS and Windows copy software and even restoring from a backup 4 mm tape. All cases pushed data to the drive faster than it could handle. I will now look into USB 2.0 or Firewire Drives. Maybe it needs a RAM buffer or for large file copies, USB 1.1 just can't hack it."
3,"""Good"" in places, but very uneven/generic dance rock (the songs all sound the same!)","At first I loved this CD, but then I realized that it didn't contain much depth and that the songs all sounded very similar. There are definitely highlights, but the ones that aren't are noticably worse. ""Party Crashers"", ""State Of Alert"", and ""Absolute Affirmation"", for example, are pretty good mindless songs, but really you wouldn't mind not having them either. It's one of those situations where if you have the songs, cool, but if you don't you wouldn't care much. Not an entirely unsatisfying purchase, but I couldn't really recommend this album when there are so many better ones out there to get first.Highlights include:""Party Crashers""""State Of Alert""""The Death Of American Radio""""Nation""""Absolute Affirmation"""
4,Infectious,"This is an excellent album, however I disagree somewhat with many of the other reviewers. The songs are certainly derivative (and what songs aren't?) but to my ear Radio4 borrows heavily from one of my all-time favorite bands - INXS. The vocal similarities to Michael Hutchence are unmistakable. This comparison is a compliment, not a critique by any means. I'm very much looking forward to new material from these guys. If you like your music funky & punky with an on-your-feet electronic bounce, do yourself a favor and check these tracks out."
1,Visioneer Strobe XP300 - DO NOT BUY!,This piece of kit is the worst scanner I have ever come across. Visioneer should be ashamed to put this on the market.
3,Not for Windows 7,"I agree with all the other reviews that it as faults in paper feeding, paper size, etc. but while I managed to deal with all that and still make good use of the thing - that was gone once I got Windows 7. Even even installing all the updated drivers from Visioneer's web site if I got one feature to work another wouldn't. If I wanted scan soft the one touch didn't work, if I wanted one touch it would only scan to certain outputs...I've spent so much time updating and changing settings to no avail!"
2,Scan Camera is not the most reliable...,"The Scan camera is not the most reliable, by that I mean in the middle of scanning it will occasionally stop picking up the image leaving you with a half-blank image. I basically gave up on the duplex scanning all together.I used to be a bug fan of Visioneer. Now I'm looking at all-in-device HP devices instead"
1,Worst Visioneer Yet,"As I have owned (or sent back) all previous models in this range, I feel I can confidently say that this is the worst constructed, most problematic model yet. It has two protusions in the paperpath that make it difficult to feed paper - and this is made worse by a microswitch the paper has to hit to start the motor. The paper guide actually makes it even more difficult to feed letter-size paper. Previous models were cleanable if you weren't afraid to open up the case - for the XP300, only one of the sensors is accessible. After a while the other one will gunge up; good luck cleaning it. Build quality is low (those lips on the front bezel are just pathetic). If Visioneer cared about their customers, they would withdraw this model from sale."
1,By far their worst scanner,"Like another reviewer, I'm also a long time customer of Visioneer. I was excited when this new XP300 was released, but after setting it up (which was easy) I discovered that it performs horribly. In previous models, the paper flowed very smoothly through the scanner, but in the XP300, it often wiggles as it is scanned, causing the image to be blurred. Everything I had loved about the Strobe is now gone. It's a piece of junk.Instead of this product, I highly recommend the Fujitsu Scansnap. It works far better and has a built-in automatic document feeder."
2,Hard to use,"I found this scanner difficult to use, especially trying to line up the paper to feed through the scanner. The software is poorly designed and organized. There is no on-off button and no light to let you know if the scanner is on. It is stupid beyond belief to not have an on-off switch or at least a light to indicate the status. As to the software, what were they thinking? Badly designed hardware, badly designed software, what was I thinking? (Actually, it was made by Visioneer so I thought it would be pretty well designed--I won't make that mistake again. I really wonder if when a company releases a bad product they ever consider what effect it has on the company's reputation. Obviously, Visioneer does not and I'd say that reflects the poor leadership of the top person in the company.)"
3,A Good Display Of Highlights.,"This hit's package was the first CD I bought from ABC. I like most of the material on here. There is no denying that ABC could write some good songs. Examples are ""Poison Arrow,"" ""All of My Heart,"" and ""Be Near Me."" I like most of the others also. The alternate version of ""The Look of Love"" is pretty cool too. This album is a good place to start. Get The Lexicon of Love after this one if you're new to the music of ABC. I actually give this CD three-and-a-half stars."
3,Good collection of hits.,"I've always had respect for ABC. They play a nice blend of sophisticated pop. They've written some catchy material. Absolutely ABC is a nice place to start for someone interested in an overview of the band. The songs come from five albums that the band has released. There are seventeen tracks. Martin Fry does a nice job with the vocals. He's quite a good singer. My favorite tunes are ""Be Near Me,"" ""S.O.S.,"" ""All of My Heart,"" and ""Poison Arrow."" Worth a listen."
3,It's Ok.,"I bought this CD after I heard a few of the songs on some cassette tapes that had a mix of 80's New Wave songs. The CD is ok but not that great, I like Poison Arrow, The Look Of Love, How To Be A Millionaire, and Be Near Me but I don't care for When Smokey Sings or the dance remix of that song or the dance remixes of the songs I like, well some are OK but others just sound too weird! So all in all not the best CD I ever bought and though I do like some of ABC's songs I prefer the songs of other New Wave groups like Thompson Twins, General Public, etc."
4,Fantastic Alt-country from Alabama,"The music they perform sort of a mixture of Uncle Tupelo, Bottle Rockets and other energetic country bands. Don't be driven away by the cartoonish cover and their choice of song titles for behind all of that is real quality and a sincere appreciation for music. It is their fine musicianship and an intelligent song writing that stands out from so many bland ""middle-of-the-road"" Alt-country bands out today. Plus, their live shows are louder than hell and they never take breaks (except for PBR)."
4,The phantom before the,"I purchased ""Pizza Deliverance"" after buying Drive By Truckers' INCREDIBLE 2001 album ""Southern Rock Opera"". I'm here to report that ""Opera"" represents a quantum leap forweard from where DBT was previously, at least based on this album.As implied by the title, ""Pizza Deliverance"" is a wiseass recording that makes fun of the south in a way that only true southerners could. Songs like ""Bulldozers and Dirt"" and ""Nine Bullets"" tell tales of down-and-out trailer trash types and the follies they get into. Unfortunately, the members of the band are far too intelligent and creative to play dumb over an entire disc. In the end, ""Pizza Deliverance"" is a decent effort that would have been more effective had it been just a tad less smart-alecky.I would recommend it, but ""Southern Rock Opera"" is by far the better album. In fact, it may have been the best rock album of the year."
4,Early Truckers,"The DBT were growing into their sound at this point. Pre-Jason Isbell, and they improved after he got there. Lots of unique songs and topics that one does not hear very often from other ""mainstream"" bands. Decoration Day, The Dirty South, and Southern Rock Opera are masterpieces; this one was the prelude to greatness. I look forward to seeing them in January."
3,i-pod only?,"I actually bought this at the Apple Store, not off Amazon, but the product is the same. This software is actually used on your i-pod, not directly from your Mac.I could be wrong, but it was all in the fine print. I haven't actually got to try it yet. I wasn't one of the lucky kids to have found a Nano in my stocking."
4,A different spin,The focus of this show is placed on the men caring for the children. With that brings their antics with raising the children while living their own lives. They are not perfect and I find lots of laughs with this show. I'll be watching future episodes.
1,Angry about this book,"Before I get started, I have to say I love books with very strong character development, finding out what motivates people, why they do what they do. Wally Lamb's book had very little plot but is one of the best I've ever read simply because of the strength of the characters. I finished reading The Little Friend this morning and I was so angry. Tartt spent 450 pages on drivel, yes we understand Harriet's motivations but we really don't care. She spent significantly more pages on snakes than she did on the ending and there was so much potential for a great ending. What did her sister remember? Will Harriet ever be connected to all the problems she caused for the Ratliffs? Will anyone ever recognize that Harriet needs therapy or how emotionally abused she is? Tartt reeled the readers in with an intriguing mystery in the first pages but the story plodded along to the end (it wasn't an ending, it just ended). She could have left out the first 350 pages and had a much better book."
1,Appalling ...Marketing,"I so enjoyed the Secret History that, like every other American whose purchase made this book an instant best-seller, I rushed out to buy Donna Tartt's latest. I too then spent a weekend slogging through 550 pages of murky, torpid prose--otherwise known as a literary quagmire. Notice how, in almost every picture, Donna Tartt looks like she just tasted something sour? It must be rereading this book that caused it!...the many, many, many bad reviews from other readers is ridiculsous that they won't allow a rating of no stars out of five, which is definitely what I would have awarded this book (though it doesn't quite deserve even that.)If you still feel that you must read this book, I have two words for you: public library."
2,Ugggg!,I can not say how dissapointed I was with this book. I read The Secret History then The Little Friend right after. How dissapointed I was. The plot went on endlessly leaving me frustrated and very empty in the end. It felt like she ended the book half way through the last chapter. The slow painful build up and the subsequent fizzle of an ending seemed so pointless with so many unanswered questions I felt dizzy. I have very little time to read for pleasure and I feel as if that time was wasted. I will wait a little longer to do my reasearch before I spend the money on a newly released book again.
2,Dark Shadows and Star Wars,"Along with all the valid comments by other readers, I found the pop culture references confusing. When trying to determine when exactly the story was taking place, there was Allison devoted to Dark Shadows, cancelled in 1970 or 1971, and a Star Wars figurine stolen at camp, circa 1977. Another reference put the story back in the 1960's. Don't publishers have fact checkers for this stuff?"
2,"There is NO ENDING, it JUST STOPS","There are so many well written reviews already, that I will just add my biggest complaint. Donna Tartt FORGOT TO ADD AN ENDING! I thought a couple pages had been torn out of my book! Since not every reviewer complains about this, perhaps it is an accepted style of writing. However, after all the character development, and potentially exciting sub-plots, and after chasing down a potential murderer for so many pages...we are left with NOTHING. So there was no point to read it. No conclusion. Just colorful characters, none of them likeable, and vivid descriptions of disgusting predicaments that left me nauseous. I disagree, however, with giving this book 1 star, since Ms. Tartt's writing is not bad writing. A stupid romance novel can get one star. This book draws you in and makes you feel like you are in the world with the characters, and can see and smell what they do. You come to understand what kind of people they are. It just doesn't do you any good."
3,"great characters, great writing, but missing plot","Donna Tartt has certainly not lost her craft, in The Little Friend, she proves herself to be a great writer. I enjoy her writing style and I didn't find the book boring...but it was ultimately frustrating.Her ability to draw such realistic and compelling characters, especially Harriet, is impressive. Personally, I loved Harriet. I found her realistic and engaging.The main problem is that the book is overly long, not a whole lot happens, the minimal plot is not particularly suspenseful or dramatic, and the ending is puzzling--what are we supposed to take away from this well-written book about a compelling young woman? While I like novels with more open-ended ideas, I was ultimately left feeling empty, not inquisitive.I can appreciate Donna Tartt's writing, and Harriet managed to get under my skin, but the novel as a whole, didn't do it for me."
2,"man, oh man..","the only reason i finished the book was because i KNEW, just KNEW that she (Tartt) wouldn't let me down.. however, i was wrong.. ""the secret history"" is my favorite book and i really can't believe how different ""the little friend"" turned out to be.. there's none of the same magic.. and it's definitely NOT a page turner.. on the contrary, i could barely stay awake reading it.. i'm sorely disappointed and hope that Tartt will try again and redeem herself.."
2,A big disappointment,"This novel was a huge disappointment, especially since it's been described as a masterpiece in the literary media. While well written the descriptive passages run on too long. Little Harriet Defresnes is out to solve her brother's murder but the authors spends an inordinant amount of time exploring the personality quirks Harriet's relatives. At the end of 555 pages we still don't know who murdered 9 year old Robin Dufresnes so what was the point of even reading this book? For the cover price it'd be nice to see the mystery solved or have a little closure. Instead we're left with an unsolved murder and a family that is even more dysfunctional than it was in Chapter one. Over all, reading this book was waste of time."
1,Bored to tears!,"I suffered through 624 pages of this book. Honestly, it was torcherous. I was just hoping for a great ending the entire time and didn't get it. If you're into very,very detailed books with not much happening you will love it."
2,Could have been interesting,"The story is really intriguing - a small boy is murdered and his younger sister seeks answers/revenge/information. Instead the story is wordy with too much description and too much focus on non-main characters, without enough focus on people like the mother, sister, etc.Without giving anything away, the ending was disappointing to me, but perhaps wouldn't be to others. It got really slow moving at the end, and I wanted the book to be over with about 150 pages left."
1,Worst Book I've Ever Read. Sadly.,"I'm an avid reader, a few books a week for my entire adult life, and this is quite honestly the worst book I have ever read. I adored the Secret History and was excited to pick this up, but it was, frankly, torture. I kept reading in the hopes that there would be some kind of ending that made me glad I spent hours on this book, unfortunately I was wrong. Save your money and your time. Read something else!"
3,I wanted to love it...,"The Secret History is absolutely one of my favorite books. Like everyone else, I was desperate for her second book to come out. When it did, I sunk my teeth into. Sadly, I found it tedious. I kept waiting to connect to it. Some of my favorite books have started out slow, since it was Tartt I absolutely wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt. However, I only made it through 313 of the 555 pages. I didn't mean to stop reading it. Somehow I did and I haven't been able to get back to it since. I absolutely admired and enjoyed her writing, but it wasn't enough. Now I am contemplating whether I should read the rest or not. On the one hand I really want to finish it, but I don't want to go back to the beginning - also the reviews are not very good. So I only recommend reading if you REALLY love Tartt, have the patience and the time, and really enjoy the craft and subtly of her writing."
2,Disappointing,"Like many other readers, I felt there were too many unanswered questions. The ending was silly."
2,Disappointingly Boring & Verbose,"I cannot imagine how she made any money for this book. It's boring, long-winded, and downright dull. IMO, only the Russian classic authors could get away with paragraph long sentences...I read a little over half of it, then went to the back and read the last few chapters. There was not one single character that I cared for...most of them were mere stick figures with no flesh on their bones. I've never given a 2-star review before, but I hope to save others from wasting their precious time reading this way over-hyped tome."
2,Wish I Had Read the Reviews,"I loved Donna Tartt's first book, and couldn't wait to buy this one. I certainly wish I had read the reviews, as the reviews on this site are exactly how I felt. I rushed though quite a bit of this book, hoping that it would get better. Then, when I finished, I was left with a strange feeling that I must have missed the ending somehow. What a terrible ending. Do not pay money to buy this."
2,sophomore slump,"After 'The Secret History', which made Tartt a near cult figure in literary circles, she took 10 years to come up with her sophomore novel. Well, so much for the long wait... To be fair, the writing is good, with a clear portrayal of a small Mississippi town and an extended family living in the aftermath of a grisly unsolved murder of a 9 year old.Harriet, the baby sister of the murder victim, picks up the thread of the mystery 12 years later, and opens up a pandora's box of secrets... However, Tartt lingers over too many characters and their side stories to get to where she is going, and the climax is, alas, a letdown, and the reader feels frustrated that the key characters don't seem any closer to achieving redemption and/or catharsis in the end."
4,It's still a good read............,"I picked up The Little Friend on a suggestion from a co-worker at my bookstore. I have not read her first book but I intend to.First off, the book doesn't give you an answer - the mystery will remain as such. However, it was a great read. I cared about little Harriet and how her whole world was falling apart. I liked her. I liked Hely, her friend. Harriet was a strong character - intelligent and a trouble-maker. At least she was not a mindless airhead like every other 12 year old depicted now-a-days.The book is worth your time. Remember the book is set back in the days where racism was still rampant. Tartt is not a racist, so I would prefer all idiots spouting that crap to stop.Enjoy the book and relax... not every mystery is solved."
1,Dull and tedious,"This book suffers from a writer enamored with her own writing ability. Donna Tartt puts together some lovely turns of phrase, but lacks the ability to come up with a plot.I kept reading diligently waiting for everything to come together, and that just never seemed to happen."
2,"Get to the point, Ms Tartt","I have to agree with most of the reviews for this novel. I was thrilled to pick it up for the first hundred pages or so. Ms. Tartt sets up the story perfectly for an interesting story--but did she deliver? No! The author drops the ball by going into painstaking detail of houses, objects, peripheral characters--and most of all, dull dialogue that has nothing to do with the main plotline. Three hundred pages later, you will be skimming page after page wondering if she will get to the point. Worse yet, the murder that is waiting to be solved in the meantime, unfolds predictably, without much suspense or twists."
1,Waste of time!,"As the mother of a toddler, spending what little free time I have reading a good book is definitely a luxury. After careful selection and much anticipation, though, this book was nothing but a huge disappointment and a major waste of time! It started out fine enough...suspenseful and quite interesting. However, it didn't take long before I forgot all about the murdered brother entirely, and found myself lost in the monotonous details of completely insignificant things (why DO we need to know the entire history of one cup?). Oh, and the end? Forget it! I found myself flipping the pages, certain that there had to be something else that I missed. Was it too ""deep"" for me? Did I somehow miss the meaning entirely? I doubt it. I honestly think Ms. Tartt simply bored herself into some kind of writer's block and decided to call it done. Ridiculous!"
3,What happened?,"I enjoyed many parts of ""The Little Friend"". Ms. Tartt obviously has lots of talent but this book needed to be edited. The book roamed from one character to another. Characters were introduced and then forgotten. Why the long descriptions if the character is only peripheral? The story is about Harriet's search for her brother's killer. That main theme is never resolved but is left open at the end of the book. The question of the whole family's future is brought up and never resolved. What happened after the car accident. Was the family destitute? It seems that the last part of the book was left unfinished. I was very disappointed. This book has be compared to ""To Kill a Mockingbird"". I don't think so. Somewhere in this mess there was a great book but as published it is not. Somehow the final chapter was lost."
1,VERY VERY DISAPPOINTING,"I can't believe I wasted so much time reading this 555-page book. The ending was SO thoroughly disappointing, that I was in disbelief. I'm the type of person who will always finish a book to the end, regardless of how bad it seems, because I optimistically hope it will get better. This did not. Too many unresolved issues, not enough character development, and most of all...they didn't even get to the bottom of the murder that started the book. I really had high hopes for this book, since I so enjoyed The Secret History. But, Tartt really fell short on this one."
1,oh my ...,"I never not finish a book. In fact, I'm usually up all night trying to finish whatever I'm reading because I can't put it down. But ... I have to say, I have just under 100 pages left to read and I just can't do it anymore. Each night I struggle to read two pages before I fall asleep out of boredom and frustration. I am so disappointed. I loved the Secret History (read it in two evenings) and much looked forward to reading this new one. And now, I doubt that the balance of the book will save it, especially from the comments below.Final comments: First, I read Crime and Punishment with more fervor. Second, if anyone in the book does anything ""ostentatiously"" one more time, I'm going to have to scream."
2,Closure Please,"Donna Tartt has a beautiful style of writing, but evidentally has never heard of CLOSURE. That was the most disappointing ending I have ever read. She did not tie upone loose end. It was not even written so we could surmise what would happen. What a disappointment."
2,The Little Friend disappoints,"""The Little Friend"" is ultimately disappointing in its lack of plot development and resolution. (Or is it supposed to be about a fifteen-year-old's summer fling with existentialism, in which we probably cannot expect a final resolution?) Harriet is a well developed, understandable character; however, this is not true of the other characters, which seem for the most part to be one faceted. A disappointing read.(It was also surprising to find that the author's use of the verb ""lay"" would not pass an eighth grade grammar test!)"
3,"A really good novel, but still. . .","I adored The Secret History. It's one of my best loved novels ever, for its pacing, its eccentric yet believable characters, and its relentless stride to the unhappy yet inevitable conclusion. I don't generally buy books; I get them from my library or borrow them from people, but as soon as I saw that Donna Tartt had a new book out, I ran as fast as I could to the nearest bookstore and bought it in hardcover!Alas, I was disappointed with this novel. The writing is brilliant, and the characters impeccable, but the plot meandered far to much, and the ending was inconclusive. There were a number of extremely suspenseful scenes, but for me, the suspense ended in frustration as none of the haunting questions posed in the beginning of the novel were answered.The Secret History was a perfect novel, in my opinion, and Donna Tartt is obviously a superior writer. I suppose that I was disillusioned by The Little Friend only because it had such an amazing precedent."
1,It is NOT The Secret History,"The Secret History is a book I read, reread, and read again (several times) in one sitting. There are very few books that seem to force you to turn the page and read on. It is easily one of my favorites. I have waited for Tartt's next book for years. Frankly, I was bitterly disappointed in The Little Friend. To say that it did not flow nearly as well as TSH would be a vast understatement. Although Tartt's descriptions of the life and times of Harriet were accurate, it was unbelievably boring. There were so many different charecters, each representing a sterotypical aspect of the time period. I can't think of one thing I liked about it except, it was written by an author who previously wrote an AWESOME book. Don't buy it, it's not worth it....I think I'll go read The Secret History again."
2,Tartt Not Sweet,"After what seemed like months of hype in magazines, book reviews and NPR, I was chomping at the bit to read The Little Friend. About half way through the book I began to wonder if all those critics had been given a different edition to read. The story idea is interesting, but the characters are wooden and the prose is awkward--a fine literary vocabulary, but decidedly lacking in finesse. I'd recommend Swan by Frances Mayes as an alternate read."
3,Compelling Characters with interesting plot to nowhere,"The characters in Donna Tartt's The Little Friend were well drawn and compelling. I found it fascinating to look at the society of Alexandria, Mississippi from the angles she chose, but, in the end, I felt that what promised to be a compelling plot, fizzled out and fell desperately short of the mark."
1,Re-read the Secret History instead!,"After a decade of anticipation, I was very disappointed. This book was very difficult to read. Some of the passages rambled for pages. After reading some of the flashback or dream passages, I had to go back several pages to see where the main story line left off. This book could have been a couple of hundred pages shorter with all the drivel cut out, and still been just as good (or bad). I think this is the only book (in 30+ years of reading) I have ever fell asleep trying to read. Save yourself the money, and reread The Secret History again. Ms Tartts sophmore effort fails."
1,Sell It Back Quick,"I read the ""professional"" reviews of this book andcouldn't wait to get my hands on it. Too bad Ididn't wait for READERS to review this book. Mycomments echo the majority of reviews. AlthoughHarriet was quite appealing, spending a paragraphon the white trash Ratcliff family was too much.Much of the story was contrived and not verylikely to have happened artist's license or not. Thescene where Harriet and Hely manage to drop a poisonoussnake from an overpass and somehow have the snakelatch onto ""Gum"" Ratcliff as she drives below wasthe last straw. I tried to skip through to see ifRobin's death was ever explained but gave up. I'll haveto live without the knowledge. How sad to havesuch an eagerly anticipated book be such a downer."
1,Not all that great,"What a horrible and boring read, I guess she really only had one good book in her after all. The Secret History is my favorite book, The Little Friend was bad, predictable and boring. With 80 pages left and no suspense or story I was forced to skim to the end. It did not hold my intrest at all."
1,"Re-read ""The Secret History"" instead","I eagerly awaited the arrival of Tartt's second novel, having consumed ""The Secret History"" one summer during a several day train trip in Canada. Alas, ""The Little Friend"" is a bore. The suspense, intellectualness, and overall excellence of ""The Secret History"" is all but missing from her latest effort. Tartt fans won't want to believe that her followup novel could be so far off the literary mark (I'm still surprised by how disappointed I am), but you really are better off re-reading ""The Secret History"" rather than buying or borrowing ""The Little Friend"". I have my fingers crossed that her third novel is closer in quality to her first effort."
1,"long, boring and self-indulgent!","Well, what a waste of time and money (for me!) Little Friend was. Having loved Secret History, and rating it as one of my all time fave books, Little Friend was one of the MOST boring books that I have read in a long time.I have no doubt that Donna Tartt can write, what I want to know is why she would waste her time with this self-indulget drivel? I actually thought that my book was missing it's final page, as I could not believe that after ploughing through it all, there was virtually no resolution!If you haven't bought this, don't bother - wait until it's in the bargain basement!"
1,the Little Friend I wish I hadn't met,"Sometimes I wonder what planet I'm on when I read a book so highly recommended, that turns out to be so highly overrated.This book is beautifully written. Prose is layered upon prose, beautifully descriptive of a small southern town: Harriet reminds me of Scout in ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" and the aunts are typical characters of early Truman Capote. You can smell the moss, and hear the drawl. You have uppity ""nigras,"" white trailor trash, ladies who have lost the mansion, mothers who have lost their minds, abusive fathers, preachers with snakes: even Houdini!! I believe the only charactor not thrown in for extra interest is a nun on a roller coaster.There are so many disfunctional characters in this book who are never explained that it made my head spin. This book has a lot of beginning, a ton of boring middle, and a real lack of ending.Never did figure out who the little friend was. Frankly, didn't care."
1,Quantity does NOT equal quality,"With mucho expectation did I open this thick novel, only to find myself nearly unable to get through the chapters and chapters of pointless description and forced poetry. I confess it was painful - that awful feeling where you want to keep your eyes open, but they just won't stay open! In fact, I fell asleep a couple of times as I toiled. Is this a fun read? No way. Is it edifying in any way? Afraid not. It's just long. Tartt seems to think very little of her readers; she tries to impress with length, thinking you won't notice her lack of conviction or her inability to create vivid characters - or to plot an epic novel! People aren't as dumb as she thinks. And she should respect how hard most of us have to work to earn the money we make to buy her books! Well, never again. She's lost this fan for good."
2,"A beginning, a muddle and finally an end","Donna Tartt's style drew me in quickly and I had high hopes for The Little Friend. Having now ploughed through its 500-some pages I'm certain 300 of them could have been edited.Is Ms Tartt unable to leave any detail undescribed? Must everything be ""like"" something else? I cringed at certain synonyms (a rolled-up carpet like a log... an Aunt helps Harriet and Hely over it like a scout leader helping them across... surprise, a log). And why ""shrubbery (privet, holly)""? In case readers ignore what shrubbery is? Towards the end I glossed over certain sections, confident they had no bearing on plot or characterization.Stereotypes abound too, in particular the black maids and housekeepers. It would not have surprised me to hear one of them utter ""Mam'zelle Edith"".Suffice to say that as I dutifully read the closing pages, I couldn't have cared less what became of Harriet or Danny and only the urge to be done with the story took me through to its end."
3,"Not as good as The Secret Hisory, but a good read","I bought this book having loved The Secret History, and I have to say I was disappointed. The reviews on the back were very good, but the story just wasn't as captivating and the characters were much more transparent.That said, however, it did keep me entertained. The setting is dark and sticky, the characters are beautifully described, even though they are mostly not so beautiful. And the character of Harriet is fascinating. However, I did not, as one reviewer assured me I would, 'fall in love with Harriet.' She was just a little too odd.If you want an interesting read, and don't mind that the book ends a little diappointingly..in that, it doesn't properly end, this is a good story. However, don't expect another 'The Secret History.'"
1,Do NOT waste your time,"The ending is not even clever. It is like she just got tired of writing and stopped. The story is so complex and fascinating that I was ANGRY at the ending. The ending makes no sense. It is not worth reading through 624 pages. Truly, you will want to throw the book if you sit through it."
1,"Tedious, boring","I don't need to know every detail, like the mosquito bite Harriet's hand and she scratched it. Can't seem to remember the plot line it is so convoluted with all the intricate, unnecessary description of characters, places, thoughts. An insult to the reader."
4,The Little Friend,"People who are Tartt 'devotees' because of ""The Secret History"" probably are too critical of her latest. ""The Secret History"" and ""The Little Friend"" are simply two very different types of stories. ""The Little Friend"" emerges as an interesting period piece; reminiscent of many childhoods, but adult at the same time. Had I been as precocious as Harriet Cleve Dufresenes during my adolescence, I would have delighted in pulling such an 'adult' book off the shelves."
1,Little Friend = Big Waste O' Time,"Not since reading Anne Rice's the -Witching Hour- have I been so angry to come the closing pages of a book. While Donna Tartt won my heart with her fan-freaking-tastic novel -The Secret History- -- which remains one of my favorites -- -The Little Friend- lacks any sort of satisfying closure. Please don't tell me that was ""the point."" If I wanted lack of closure I wouldn't read novels. Although I remained hopeful to the very end of page 624 that Tartt would use her considerable skills to tie up what could have been a compelling story, I ended up closing the book in disgust. Snakes are creepy; so are rednecks; but all the creepy and winding description in the world does nothing if it goes nowhere, which is where it went for this reader. Here's hoping her third novel respects the reader's need for a structured and tied-together plot."
1,thanks to all the reviewers who hated this novel,"As so many other readers I was trapped into buying this book because I so much liked Tartt's first novel, the Secret History. Having reached page 163, I decided to quit. Life is too short to waste on boring and pretentious books such as this one. But wasn't I missing something? And who killed Robin? After reading the reviews, I feel relieved. I understand there is nothing to wait for. Thank you reviewers!! You saved me from many hours of additional boredom."
3,Mixed Feelings,"I read The Little Friend because I had already finished Secret History and really liked it. However, I had a mixed reaction to this second novel. I liked the character development and the depiction of life in the South of the 70's, and I was impressed with the pace of the book. Oh, it wasn't fast paced! Actually, it moved slowly. But I find Ms. Tartt very skillful at making me take the story at her intended pace rather than at my own. I have no idea if others find this to be true, but I became convinced early on that Ms. Tartt was not going to allow me to hurry.In retrospect, I enjoyed almost everything about the book, except the ending. I was disappointed as I read the final pages. It seemed that Ms. Tartt found no resolution to her plot, that the novel just stopped. I have read other novels wherein specific events or circumstances were left to my imagination, but the ending to The Little Friend was jolting."
2,Disappointing and certainly over-rated,"This book was recommended to me, so I felt I had to finish it. Even people who don't like the story seem impressed with the characterisation, but my biggest problem with this and with The Secret History is that I never feel involved in the stories and can barely identify with any of the main characters.Both books appear technically good, but there's little in either beyond an initial good idea. Not recommended.I very nearly didn't finish The Little Friend and won't read any future books by Tartt."
1,i'm so bummed....,"i had so much hope for another 'secret history' but this sure isn't it. what happened? i kept thinking if i read just one more page it would get better, but it never did. the whole snake thing was just too much, too ridiculous. i don't think this would even make a bad movie. c'mon, donna, where's the stuff?"
3,secret histories vs little friends,"The book is compulsively readable for most of its (unnecessarily great) length but is ultimately a disappointment. (Would we have ordered our copies with such alacrity, had it not been for The Secret History?) The abundance of irrelevant, if frequently fascinating, detail, the flawed structure and lack of conclusion put one in mind of an extremely sophisticated exercise in creative writing which has sadly gone wrong."
3,Not nearly as good as The Secret History,"The Little Friend could have been vastly improved with some judicious editing to remove 100 or so pages. And can someone tell me who or what ""the little friend"" of the title is? If it's revealed in the novel anywhere, I plain missed it."
2,In desparate need of an editor!,"It is the story of a 12 year old lost in a world of depressed and nonsensical adults caused by the unsolved murder of her brother years before that drones on and on with descriptions and commas and semi colons and colons and paragraphs composed of one sentence!!Please! The story, in and of itself is gripping but one must find it in the wordiness of the writer. This book reads like someone chatting on and on in your ear with you waiting desparatly to find out what is it all about??? And the ending leaves a lot to be desired! You finally get to the meat of the story and ""BAM"" it is over with loose ends flailing every which way. My advice - leave it unless you have nothing better to do and enjoy long winded talkers."
4,Compelling,"I was very excited to read this book since I was such a big fan of The Secret History. I was not disappointed -- I found myself itching to leave work so I could return to it. The characters were amazing and vivid, as was the town Tartt created. However, I did not find it as sly and smart as History. Still, much better than most of what I've read this year."
1,Where oh where has our little Tartt gone?,"What have ten years done to Donna Tartt? As one reviewer put it, in recent photos she looks uptight like she's just sucked on a lemon, and now she has written this lemon of a book! She seems to take herself VERY seriously. And it has taken a toll on her writing. Is she suffering an identity crisis? She seems to be torn between art and entertainment. If she really wants to write poetry like Eliot then she shouldn't be writing novels for the common folk. The Little Friend is, to be kind about it, not the most exciting read. Tartt may be in love with the sound of her own voice, but it's presumptuous of her to think anyone else will love it. In ten years, she has become more academic than she was before. The Secret History was one of my favorite books. I sincerely hope she gets down off her high horse and writes something enjoyable again."
1,THE MOST INFURIATING BOOK I HAVE EVER READ,THIS STORY HAS LEFT ME TOTALLY AT A LOSS FOR WORDS.ALTOUGH I WANTED DESPERATELY TO FINISH IT I COULD NOT.THE STORY WAS LOST IN TOO MANY OUTSIDE PERSONALITIES & PLACES. IT'S NOT FOR READERS WHO ENJOY A GOOD STORY LINE.
1,A Huge Disappointment.,This book is awful. I'm glad I borrowed it from the library. I finished it and was disgusted with how weak the ending was.
3,Long awaited and dissapointing,The Little Friend is well written but it just never takes off. I was a big fan of The Secret History but gave up reading this one about 3/4 through due to lack of interest.
1,Author's conceit,"The Little Friend was one of the least pleasurable reading experiences I've had in years. Tartt did a terrific job on her first book, The Secret History. That book was magical AND suspenseful. With this new one, Tartt strains to achieve an even higher level of magic, but that is NOT a quality that can be forced onto the page. Instead, she offers up is page after page of over-heated, meaningless description and contrived character development that simply does not achieve significance. It is almost as if she, in her inflated self-belief, has tried to trick readers into thinking that The Little Friend is some sort of literary masterpiece. Nothing could be further from the truth. The Little Friend is a desperate work of artifice that falls short of mystery and poetry. Her first book had both qualities, effortlessly. This time she has tried too hard, and the result is hard to get through."
2,"To Kill a Mockingbird look alike , Set in the 70's","If I had not read all the rave reviews over this, my expectations might not have been so high, and I wouldn't have been so disappointed. This is a look alike of To Kill a Mockingbird (names of characters have been changed to ""protect the innocent""-and perhaps to avoid questions of plagarism)so,I'm not sure why this book/story was 10 years in the making. Tartt does have a way with words, but the lack of originality was surprising. If you haven't read To Kill A Mockingbird, then this may be new territory for you-it is not totally without merit. If your still curious, check the book out from your local library,borrow from a friend, or wait for the paperback."
3,Disappointing,"Feeling more like something that would have been penned ten years ago by Goth Queen Anne Rice, or better yet V.C. Andrews in her ""Flowers in the Attic"" heydey, this Southern tale of murder and revenge I felt missed the mark more than it hit. I like so many others loved ""The Secret History"", and couldn't wait to break into this. To the authors credit if she wanted to create an entirely different world, she did. However she did it without creating any likable or redeeming characters. Just a young over smart pseudo protagonist, her eccentric Aunts, and a pack of brothers straight out of the movie ""Deliverence"". The book moved in fits and starts, and at times I was just plain bored.It also lends itself to a climax that never pays off and a slew of unanswered questions. By the end this was like the reading equivalent of the feature ""Mulholland Falls"". Flashy, but what the [heck] was the point?"
2,I cleaned my reading glasses and spent money for this?,"Well dang! I just finished this book a couple of days ago and I'm still irked. As a long time reader I have never finished a book (if you call it a finish) that was more frustrating. The publisher is responsible for approving this read. In addition, to the non-ending, it was just too long.The start of the story was intriguing and grabbed my interest. There was no build-up from there but I kept thinking a great ending was ahead right up to the last few pages. In retrospect Ida Rhew knew when to get out.If it was rewritten to about 350 pages with an actual ending it could be entertaining but I would never know because I'm done."
2,What Happened?????,"I wish this book had ended differently, Actually, I wish that it had just ended. I thoroughly enjoyed reading ""The Little Friend"" with its wonderful attentive detail to atmosphere and characterization, but when I closed the cover, I felt cheated. I'm dismayed that I spent all the hours, many of them late at night, turning pages and devouring word after printed word, only to find that when it ended, there was no resolution. Nada, none, zip, zilch. Bleah. I like my books to have an ending. It doesn't have to be a warm, fuzzy, happy, feel-good ending, just an ENDING!I sure didn't find it here."
1,The Little Friend,"To enjoy ""The Little Friend,"" one must not only suspend disbelief, one must abandon it entirely. This thin tale, bloated to epic proportions, is an exhausting mess of a book. The only reason I finished it was because I was reluctant to hurt the feelings of the friend who loaned it to me and recommended it with great enthusiasm. Ms. Tartt leaves absolutely nothing to the imagination, excruciatingly detailing everything possible, from facial expressions, to clothing, to settings, to what the character did - or did not- or perhaps possibly did or did not - see, think , do, etc. (The screenwriters will have a very easy time of it.) There is not one truly engaging or believable character and the author telegraphs every supposed surprise. Worst of all, this really a distasteful book."
1,I really wanted to like it...,"I am an enormous fan of The Secret History; it has been my favorite book since it was published. I could hardly wait to receive this book in the mail & read it. I am sorry to say-there is no good reason to recommend this book. It is way too long; the storyline about the redneck Ratliff family is boring and feels out of place with everything else (even though those characters are part of the ""plot."") The main character is not too likable-though she has a really lousy life-so you can't blame her for her behavior. I hope this book turns out to be an aberrant blip in the remainder of Donna Tartt's writing career."
1,Such a long wait for so little,"I can't tell you how excited I was to see the new book by Donna Tartt. I continue to rave about Secret History for its detail, intrigue, etc. After reading this one, I am almost embarrassed about my past propaganda...It's almost unbelievable that this is the same author. In the last book, you couldnt wait to turn the page to see what happened to each character. In this book, I honestly couldnt have cared less. I kept on reading expecting to find some hint of that fabulous writing but was disappointed with each chapter/section.I was almost happy to see that other Tartt fans here agree with my assessment...I was wondering if I was losing it.Trust me. Some things aren't worth waiting for...."
5,Duck Hunting in May?,"I too began this book thinking it would end with a murder solved. However, half-way through the book I realized Tartt would not reward us so simply. And that is precisely the point. This book is about the way a bright young girl deals with the boredom and anxiety presented to her by an empty summer and ""no one at home"".The fact that there is no ""ending"" is entirely appropriate, as there will be no ending for Harriet. Her life will forever be affected by her brother's death and its effect on her family. It does not matter who killed Robin.A note to the editor though: isn't duck hunting season long gone by Mother's day?"
4,Harriet's Hauntings,"This novel may drag a little, but then, all books over 400 pages tend to.It's very interesting on the point that this seems to be a study about a girl haunted. And how could she not be? Her family is a gallery of horrors and monsters and she seems to try to hold to a semblance of normalcy. Is that the reason people have to see her as a bizarre character?Her mother is an emotional cripple, her father's a plain creep, her grandmother lives on another word, and so does her sister.Following the fascinating loops Tartt has designed, the horrifying consecuences of her acts prove that the ""whodunit"" motif is just wool pulled over the eyes. This novel is so much more than that!"
2,Overwritten...,"...and not at all to my taste. The prose is excellent, but there is far too much of it, with far too little to say. Also, I have a strong feeling that Ms. Tartt has been reading Angela Thirkell. The descriptions of Edie might have been lifted right out of Thirkell."
1,I am a disappointed Tartt fan,"The Secret History is my favorite book, so I was really looking forward to her new novel. I had the book on order long before it was released. What a disappointment. It took me months and months to finish because I simply was not interested in any of the characters, the story or even the writing style. this book was really painful to read. It really isn't about the disappointing ending, but the almost unbearable journey getting there."
4,Absorbing tale of two families,"I really enjoyed this book! The main character and supporting cast were fascinating. I feel that the reviewers who criticized it as boring, or because it didn't come to a conventional conclusion are off base. Its full of wry humor that at times made me laugh out loud, and insights about childhood that are a bit like Stephen King (IT) on a good day, with a bit of Faulkner thrown in. The way the two families were woven together was worth the price of admission even if the book had no other virtues. I also liked that Little Friend doesn't fit easily into any genre or category. It is very different from "" A Secret History"" but can stand on its own."
1,very disappointing.,"After reading and rereading The Secret History, I could not wait for Ms Tartt's second novel. I was very disappointed. I could not finish this book, because I was bored with the story that went nowhere and the characters I could not care less about. I hung in there 3 quarters of the way and then gave up. My sister managed to make it to the end and told me it did not get any better and I did not miss a thing."
2,One Disappointed Classicist,"First, I'd like to emphasize that I loved The Secret History. I've waited years for Tartt's second book, but I found it something of a let-down. I suppose this is mostly because I enjoyed Secret so much and I was expecting more of the same (I'm an academic and a classicist, and I was thrilled with the way Tartt brought my field to life). The Little Friend is cute enough, but, my own obscure interests aside, it just doesn't compare to Secret History (first novel or not, Ms. Tartt)."
3,"oh, donna","I enjoyed the entire book until the last few pages. so much build up, friction, tension, beautiful(yet, sterotypical) storytelling, and in the end, a total frinking cop out."
1,Endlessly hoping for something to happen,"I guess I was expecting a mistery and got a sleeping aid instead. Honestly, I could only bear listening to the unabridged tapes while driving (there's nothing that I hate more than driving) and trying to fall asleep (for which the book did wonders).I kept hoping that beyond the endless descriptions of characters there would be at least some lame attempt to make it into a story with a plot. The abridgement of an abridged version would at least get you through the pain more quickly."
2,Disappointing,"Excellent premise, brilliant writing, but, in the end, very disappointing novel. A huge let down."
2,Long,"I like suspense and I like mystery, and this book had both, but the story never really climaxed. There was so much unneeded description and running around. Only until Harriet went to the tower at the end did it get good and then nothing. I was disappointed. I could write my own ending, but them I would just write my own book."
2,"Well, there went a weekend of my life that I won't get back","On page 447 of the Australian edition of this interminable tract, the central character gives her mother some good advice which runs along the lines that if you don't want to do something, you should just stand up for yourself and not do it. If only Ms Tartt had followed her own advice. That she CAN write is not the question. It's whether she really wanted to write this particular novel that one is left wondering."
2,More of Secret History,"The Secret History was a wonderful surprise. It was an excellent, enthralling read which I couldn't put down. The follow up was different in many ways. It was a little long, a little less interesting and not a patch on the first work. The characters though well developed did not evoke my interest. There was little sympathy or empathy with any of them. An interesting idea for a book but ultimately led to a feeling of what was the point?Tartt is a wonderful writer. The book is not bad, it just wasn't my taste. For the type of book it was someone like Carl Hiassen does it much better."
2,many incomplete books,"This is not a single novel, but a bunch of first drafts thrown together, and none of the plot lines or characters reach any conclusion.Tartt was undoubtedly afraid of ""sophmore slump"" after The Secret History, and she had every right to be afraid, as she nailed the dud 2nd try perfectly."
2,False Advertising,"600 pages of waiting to find out by whom or at least why or at least SOMETHING about the death of a nine year old boy in his own back yard and we get nothing. If it had been a terrible book I would never had gotten frustrated, because I simply would not have hung in that long, but it was haunting and the characters were wonderfully developed. That doesn't excuse the virtually dishonest cover flaps: there is no mystery, there is just dysfunctional family life on both sides of the tracks in a small town in Mississippi. Unless being depressed by most of a novel and then being infuriated by the last 4 pages when you realize that you will gain nothing by having spent some of your precious summer novel time on it, stay away.p.s. There isn't even a ""little friend""."
2,"Oh, the pain!","I had sworn off negative reviews, but this long book of adverbs and meandering paragraphs, and let us not forget the additional parentheses in far too many sentences has had my reading attention for far too long! I wanted to like Harriet and her quest to find and convict her dead brother's murderer, but the book is just so flat. We have Harriet and her large family of aunts, caretakers, her absent father, the car salesman, the gross-out of all snake-handler and his boxes of snakes. Then the Ratcliffe family, and frankly the only time the pages come alive--except for the horrible snakes--is when the Ratcliffes are present. I stuck with this book until the bitter end, and the only part about the end of the book that was sweet, is that it was finally over. Now I am be free of those pesky adverbs and parentheses that Ms Tartt finds so appealing. Oh, the pain!"
1,The Big Disappointment,"FOR SERIOUS INSOMNIACS ONLY, this book clocks in at 555 dull, slow-paced, un-evenly written pages. These pages contain lifeless characters of no redeeming qualities whatsoever, entrapped in a story so long and boring, the reader could only hope there would be illustrations to wake oneself up.What's most disappointing is the writing style. How many times (in a single paragraph - never mind the whole book!)can an author begin a sentence with, ""Then suddenly..."" There's no surprise or anticipation for the reader, since everything 'suddenly' happens. Along with this, the author uses such words as ""whoosh! went the car driving by""...""clang! went the bell""...""zoom! went the bikes"". The only thing she didn't use was 'kapow!' and 'shazaammm!' from a good comic book (and that's too bad - it would have been the only source of excitement if she did).""THUMP!"" went the book cover to this book when I finished it - never to be opened again!"
1,Lugubrious has new meaning,"At first I was thrilled by the rich language and atmosphere of this hefty novel by the mysterious vanishing Tartt. But I soon found myself dozing off and unable to keep up my own enthusiasm for The Little Friend. I lost track of the characters. As for the plot - what happened to it? In the last analysis, neither the characters (you've seen them all before) nor the prose (way too much of a phony thing) add up. But you can throw away those sleeping pills! A great investment for insomniacs."
2,Where Is The Ending?,"I started this book and was so excited about it I told every avid reader I know that this book could be borrowed when I was through, now I am a bit emabarassed to do so. I read it anxiously to find out who killed Harriet's brother.But as pages flew I found myself dissapointed too,too many snakes,where were we going with the evil brothers of the suspected killer? Which Aunt was which? What happened to the point? Believe me I have more questions.But bottom line is the author does have talent,she made me remember with clarity the thought patterns of my childhood.She would make use of it if she wrote a sequel to this novel and satisfied us all with an explanation.There is a reference to ""your little friend"" as being Hely."
3,the little friend was danny...,"I very much enjoyed the Secret History, but was a bit puzzled in the end. What happened in the woods?? Other than that, VERY nice job wrapping everything up.As to The Little Friend... I like it, and think for themost part, reviewers are being too harsh.Don't you remember when you were a kid, playing spy, fantasizing? I do have to say I was waiting for at least one more chapter when I got to the end. In this book, Ms. Tartt left too many ends dangling. Sure, it's nice to complete the story as suits you, but this time, way too many unanswered questions. Overall, I'd recommend it for summer time reading. Good ""beach book""... slice of life that most of us are unfamiliar with..."
1,Disappointing,"I really disliked this book. The plot was practically non-existent, as was the ending. I LOVED The Secret History and bought this book in hardback (something I never do) because I couldn't wait to read it. It was so boring I finally just read the last chapter."
2,We've been hoodwinked.,"The Little Friend, the literary con game of the decade. I know why all the pictures and portraits of Donna Tartt have her looking straight ahead and unsmiling. If she were to part her lips, she'd probably burst out laughing and thinking that as Barnum said, There's One Born Every Minute. Shame on Knopf for not only perpetrating this crime, but for doing it willingly. Where is the editor who should have forced Ms. Tartt into writing an outline? Where is the editor who should have insisted on plot? Where is the editor who should have edited this pale excuse for an important novel and cut at least a hundred pages? The worse part of all this is that she shows moments of brilliance that make taking all the rest of this bad medicine even harder to swallow.This is all a sham and unfortunately legions of readers were willing to be taken in. If Ms. Tartt spends another decade writing another book, I will have no trouble at all waiting. An inexcusable travesty."
3,Fabulous writing but a poorly developed plot,"A beautifully written book that suffers from a bogged-down, meandering plot that never reaches its full potential. Numerous interesting plot threads are alluded to but never developed, characters are introduced for no apparent reason. Tartt's development of her main characters is so brilliantly detailed that I felt like I truly knew them as people by the end. But no amount of expert character development can save a lost plot. Maybe it's old-fashioned of me to expect great writing in addition to a well-executed and interesting plot. Perhaps I'm cornering myself into a future of disappointment as literary standards seem to be going the other way. But I'm sticking to my guns on this one - literary critics and academics be damned."
2,"A BIG, SPRAWLING, DISAPPOINTMENT","Do NOT get sucked in by this book! Do NOT give in the pages and pages of lush prose and evocative characters and locales! Do NOT let ""The Little Friend"" get the better of you! Why not? Because the absolute LEAST a 600-page novel about a girl searching for her brother's murderer should do is tell you whodunit! And it does not! What a big, beautiful, sprawling waste of time this is. What a disappointment."
1,Disappointing,"I loved the Secret History, so I had high expectations for this book. Boy was I disappointed! I read the hardcover edition, and I felt that it was about 150-200 pages too long. Unfortunately, they were not consecutive pages, so I couldn't just skip over the parts that dragged. I believe the story had promise, but the follow-through and character development weren't there."
2,Thank goodness I'm not the only one,"Like everyone else I looked forward to this book with great expectations. ""The Secret History"" is one of the best books I have ever read and I expected this book to be of the same calliber. I was dead wrongI thought the plot was thrilling, the characters well developed, I understood Harriet's pain and obsession and I even undersood why the book wasn't a ""happy"" one. What I did not understand was the ridiculous ending. Like others I asked myself ""What in the world was the point of all of that?"" Just a little bit of resolution would've been nice. I am thourougly dissapointed."
2,A Lost Premise,"This book was overly long, and it seemed like the original premise got lost in the story. Ms.Tartt can certainly write, but I felt the writing took over the story. Certainly the book jacket is misleading. What was the story she was trying to tell? As others have mentioned, the ending is a non-ending. Was I disappointed....most definitely!"
1,Very disappointed,"I don't know what happened here. Somewhere between The Secret History and The Little Friend Ms. Tartt forgot that she's supposed to be telling stories. Where is the story in this book? I actually returned it after suffering through 200 pages -- I didn't care how it ended and developed an intense dislike for Harriett. The other characters were mired in cliche, both classist and racist, and the faux-Southern Gothic writing style came across as just plain faux.Hopefully Ms. Tartt returns to the basics and concentrates on telling a good story, rather than writing florid prose for the sake of writing florid prose."
1,sorely disappointed,"I have a hard time believing this book was written by the same person who wrote ""The Secret History"". It took me nearly two weeks to drag through several tedious subplots to finally discover there is no ending. I agree with a previous reviewer, this book definitely needed the aid of an editor."
1,Half Hearted Effort. I want my money back!,"This book is an insult to its readers. I want my money back!!!Donna Tart is wonderful with words, but there's no plot here, no message, and even no ending that I could see. I loved her first book but this book has a rambling, go-nowhere style that is shocking for an author of her abilities. I am a published writer myself and I think if this had not been Donna Tart's book it would have seen one rejection letter after another. And HOLY COW where was the editor!!!??? Was she locked in a closet until after the book was printed? This isn't even a passable first draft of a book. Shame on you Donna for not applying your considerable talent to make this the book it could have been."
2,where's the ending?,"Reading a 550 page book for me can be daunting yet this book entertained me enough to continue only to reach the end and find that there wasn't one. Ms. Tartt certainly is an able writer but to leave the reader after so many pages feeling let down is not a good idea. I didn't read her first book and now, thought the critics raved, will probably skip it after being so disappointed with the conclusion (or lack there of) of this one."
1,A whole lot of nothing going on.,"I am just completely baffled that the author of ""The Secret History"" could have written such a pointless and unsophisticated book. I could not put ""The Secret History"" down. I cared about its lonely narrator even as he was drawn into this fantastic and terrible group of friends. That book was witty, allusive and self-conscious.This book devotes an entire chapter to the death of the family cat as though that really were a significant event. Some reviewers suggest that there is some kind of social commentary on racial injustice going on here. Are they kidding? These characters came right out of ""Gone with the Wind."" This is like 555 pages of Nancy Drew. Twelve year olds are just not that interesting."
1,The Masses and the Ph.Ds agree,"Those bored with this novel aren't necessarily mass-market readers or instant gratification junkies--I'm getting my Ph.D in English Lit, so I have pretty high tolerance for dense material, but I'm finding this an interminable, excruciatingly dull read. Every time Harriet bumps her knee or rides her bike, we have to hear about it for ten pages. The longer I stick it out with this novel, the more it seems like a parody of itself. Speaking of boring, has anyone else noticed Tartt's self-satisfied views on race? She constantly beats us over the head with them."
1,I'm exhausted!,It has never taken me so long to finish a book. The best thing about Ms. Tart's Little Friend is it showed me how musch self discipline I can muster. For a while I thought if her next book comes out a decade from now I will have just finished this one. My expectations parralelled the hype--unfortunately the end product missed the mark.
2,Not worth the wait or the time,"It's not that Donna Tartt can't write; it's that she can't STOP writing. What the editors did, I cannot guess -- there are no typos but this book would benefit by some paring down. The story of a downward spiraling family, it offers no resolution, just a long, long read but not a satisfying one. While I admired and enjoyed reading her debut novel, this one disappoints. Three-quarters of the way through this sad story, I realized I didn't like any of the characters nor did I care very much about them. Ms. Tartt's writing is curt -- and full of asides, like so -- and I felt as though I were reading a first draft that, yes, was 10 years in the making."
1,Too Grotesque,I could not finish this book. It kept spiraling downward with more grotesque and stereotypical characters on every page. I couldn't finish it.I don't understand why the critics raved. Yuck.
1,"The first 400 pages were slow, but then it got OK...","If you liked ""Secret History,"" then go read it again! Don't read this. This was a hugely disappointing second novel. I loved ""Secret History"" and its rich characters and yummy details and great plot. This novel just plodded along with characters that you didn't care about or what to learn about. The book crawled along, but the last few chapters were OK. A decent payoff for the labor of surviving the first 400 pages. In a nut shell: Skip this book and re-read ""Secret History."""
1,"really, really tedious, and nothing happened","Wish I'd read the amazon review before impetuously buying a hardbound copy of this book (or any copy for that matter). Enjoyed her first book but found the follow-up to be unbelievably tedious, and ultimately nothing happened. WAY too much information about characters that merited a paragraph or two. I kept plodding along with my reading, erroneously believing that there would be some identifiable outcome. About half way through, I realized that I was skimming entire pages ... later I began skipping chapters. It was a huge disappointment."
3,Good but not The Secret History,"Title of the review says it all. Sophomore jinx. Worth the wait, a good book, but not nearly as good as the first."
3,The Little Friend,"What?????????? The book drew me in. Very proselike. The book was dreamy and full of hope for a good mystery. At times the lengthy novel would bore me, but I wanted the mystery solved. And in the end there were just too many questions left unanswered. ""Will there be a Little Friend 2-Danny's Revenge?"". I just put the book down and I'm a little angry at the loose strings."
3,who was the little friend?,"i agree with the other reviewer...a real disappointment after ""the secret history."" Actually, i may be biased, since i have a thing about ""sick southern"" books. the characters are wonderful, but their interactions are mysterious. the young heroine is almost unbelievable, and what happens to her in the end????"
1,AAAACK!,"Most reviewers here have hit the proverbial nail on the head regarding Donna Tartt's ""The Little Friend"". I only wish I'd read them before I wasted money and time on this rambling, long-winded, unresolved tome. Hire an editor, Donna baby, please!"
3,THE STOYR WITHOUT END,THE BOOK WAS GOOD BUT THERE WAS NO STAISFACTIN WITH THE ENDING. ACUTULLY THERE WAS NOT ENDING. I WENT TO THE BOOK STORE THINKING MY BOOK WAS MISSING PAGES. STORIES SHOULD HAVE AN ENDING JUST AS THEY HAVE A BEGINNING
1,Preposterous and disappointing,"I really liked her first novel, and liked the premise and promise of this at the beginning. However, the plot was preposterous - NOBODY would act the way these characters do at the end. Why do the black and lower class white characters speak in dialect, but the ""resepctable"" whites don't ? The druggie low life types were straight out of a made for TV movie - cardboard and unbelievable. We know she can write well, so why crank out comething like this ? I only finished it (grumbling all the way) because I wanted to know the solution to the mystery, and guess what ? More disappointment."
1,This book is not boring- it's infuriating!,"I do not believe that this is a racist book at all- there are racist attitudes held by some characters, but as others have pointed out, it's set in the south in the 1970s. I didn't find this book at all boring either. In fact, I loved the entire thing until I got to the ending. At that point, this book made me furious. Hopefully this is not a spoiler; if so, I am sorry, but this book didn't really have an ending. It just came to a stop, all of the threads of the mystery still dangling in the air. That is why I'm giving it one star."
1,boring....pointless waste of my time,"I can not believe the glowing reviews others have left for this book. This is my first Tartt book and my last! I wanted to ditch it 1/3 into it.. but I have a rule to finish every book.I did not find one character to like, no good story line to keep me interested (besides finding Robin's killer! don't hold your breath!). I actually committed a first for me - I threw this book in the trash barrel to spare anyone else from picking it up.That says it all!"
1,Disappointment,Donna Tartt's The Secret History is one of my all time favorite books and one of the few books that I have actually read twice. I eagerly anticipated the release of The Little Friend and could not wait to get started. I'm sad to say that this book in no way compares to her debut. The Secret History is both intriguing and eloquent. The Little Friend is neither of these and is a chore to read.
1,Don't buy this book,Don't waste your time. The book was interesting until the end. Very good plot but the ending was horrible. I read her other book and it wasn't that good either.
2,As much plot as the Yellow Pages,"As expected, the writing was brilliant, and two stars for that alone. The dialogue was perfection. Ms. Tartt set the scene with exquisite insight and precision.Like young girls in a clothing store, the characters tried on one plot after another, ultimately rejecting all of them. The ending, when it came, was entirely unexpected. I was as if the publisher said, ""right, just give me what you have."" I was shocked to turn the page and find that there was no more. The book was a long, often beautiful, ride to nowhere.Ms. Tartt owes me an ending. I hope she will post one online, because this was a long book and I deserve to be treated better."
4,Richly descriptive,"Harriet, a twelve-year old girl, is in vengeful pursuit of Danny Ratcliffe, a delinquent and drug-addicted young man who, she is convinced, murdered her brother ten years earlier. The first half of the 555 page long novel is very slow and inconsequential, but contains some terrific and sharp descriptions of people: Harriet herself, her mother, her grandmother and the grandmother's sisters; also of Danny and his scary brothers. The atmosphere in buildings and of landscapes is also marvellously conveyed. The second half is a real page-turner and a rather terrifying thriller."
4,Good Read,"Enjoyed the book very much. A page turner, I looked forward to reading it ever night. I think the lousy reviews on Amazon are way overdone. Judging by the ones written about this book I probably will not pay attention to them anymore as I read many books and found this one to be excellent. The first ten reviews I read on Amazon were pretty awful and not reflective of the book I read."
2,What a disappointment,"I purchased this book as soon as it was published, and couldn't wait to read it. I have finally read it, and I can't believe how disappointed I am. I absolutely loved ""The Secret History"", it is one of my all time favorite books that I have ever read. This book, as is her style, was fabulous when it comes character developement, scene descriptions, dark and gloomy mystery. But why couldn't she wrap up the loose ends and give the reader some sort of answer to the question of what happened to Robin? That was the only thing that kept me reading to the end."
2,Sorry Second,"I have to agree with the reviewer stating that Tartt needed a better editor. How can anyone possibly compare this book with Ms. Tartt's first, The Secret History? The Little Friend was too detailed and drawn out...the novel lacked a consistent plot and the story was all over the place. I was sad to continue to the end of this novel because it was so terrible. Hopefully, we'll see an improvement from Ms. Tartt in future novels..."
2,"meandering, dissapointing...but hard to give up on","Reading this book is like watching a baseball game where the score wildly and unexpectedly changes every inning - and with it, your interest in the matchup. At first, your team is up by three runs and the game is exciting. Then it's down by seven runs and you start to lose interest. Then they pull even, only to fall way behind again. Finally, in the 9th, your team loads the bases and can win with a grand slam, but instead meagerly pops out to the first baseman.My point: the book has some very promising parts - enough to keep reading - but is interspersed with meandering episodes that don't further the plot. Ultimately, as the book finally begins to pick up, it ends with a whimper, making at least 50 percent of it irrelevant. Ultimately, it's unfulfilling, somewhat frustrating and almost a waste of time."
2,More than a disappointment,"Like most readers, I looked forward to Tartt's second book, but I made myself wait until I could find a used copy. I'm sure glad I didn't pay full price! The Little Friend is a book that makes you want to skim pages to see if it eventually gets to the point. There are rambling descriptions of people, places and points of view that seem to have absolutly nothing to do with the story or character development. While these descriptions are often well written, in the end, I felt like they were a waste of time. I often found myself wondering if Tartt was trying to fill a book with a prescribed number of pages, to satisfy a publishing contract."
4,Long live Harriet!!!,"What a great tale. She really captures the essence of being a child in the summer in the south. And Harriet is a great character - fearless, moral, determined. I loved her, and I found it heartbreaking that her needs were so invisible to all the people in her life.The snake stories, and there are quite a few in this book, seemed an amalgam of all those tales that southerners love to tell of near misses and tragic encounters with the feared, almost mythological, creatures.While I don't require complete resolution in a novel's ending, I do wish that this wonderful book had a more coherent conclusion.There were just to many things left unresolved.But it is still a great story."
2,I was so disappointed!...,"Like everyone else, I loved The Secret History. I only recently read it for the first time and was so excited about The Little Friend. While I enjoyed the character of Harriett, I was VERY disappointed by the ending. I just couldn't believe all that build up for 500 pages and then we learn absolutely nothing at the end. I felt like I wasted two very valuable weeks reading a book with no conclusion. This is the first review I've ever written of a book but I just had to say how disappointing the books was - especially the ending."
3,ultimately disappointing,"If I hadn't placed such high expectations as I did for the follow-up to ""The Secret History"" it's hard to say how much I would have enjoyed this book. It wasn't bad, but wasn't very good either. However, in the shadow of ""The Secret History"" it definitely disappointed me. It was too lengthy, and as far as the plot went, in my opinion, it was rather mediocre. This could have been a great book, I think. It had a lot of promise, but all in all I wasn't that impressed."
2,Confused,"I liked The Secret History, too, and I didn't think The Little Friend dragged TOO much. Yes, the ending is awful. But I confess I have an even more basic question. I don't understand the title's connection to the book. Somebody please help!"
1,major letdown,"Like many other reviewers, I was a HUGE fan of 'The Lost History"". I thought it was one of the best books I had read in many years. But 'The Little Friend"" is a major disappointment. I couldn't even get through the whole book before I sold it on amazon[.com] to cut my losses. Interesting premise, but in dire need of some self-editing."
2,Disappointment,"Like other reviewers, I couldn't get through this book-- and as someone who did her time as an English graduate student, I have the stamina for wading through less than thrilling work. But why do it if you don't have to, especially if you're expecting something compelling? The Secret History had a much tighter plot that moved along nicely, all the while creating a real sense of menace and melancholy. It was also fun to read. Reading this, I kept on waiting for all the dense descriptive passages and hints of violence to amount to something-- reveal a secret, or build to a conclusion. It didn't. I don't think this marks me a simple-minded reader. But I do think it indicates a real problem with this novel."
1,Don't waste your time,"I was lucky...I got this from my public library, so I haven't wasted any money, just time. It was a big disappointment to me, though some of the writing was good. There wasn't much insight into the characters and was certainly unsatisfying in its ending. I felt that the author had just done short stints of writing, little pieces of this and that, and then had strung them together to make a book. What really bothered me was the media hype around this book (front page of the NYTimes Review of Books, People magazine, a syndicated book review feature in my local ""free press"", to give some examples) which gave the impression that this was a wonderful book and that time spent reading it was worthwhile. I feel that I wasted my time and didn't come away with anything worthwhile. Maybe the author simply didn't know what to conclude, which is why there was no conclusion. I think she was searching for what this book was to be about, but never found it. Silly and boring, unfortunately."
2,Skip The Little Friend and go straight to Secret History,"I read The Secret History last winter and LOVED it-- even gave copies as Christmas gifts. I picked up The Little Friend anticipating the same, captivating stortelling and drama. WHAT a disappointment. I actually feel angry that I just wasted my time reading 550 pages that led NOWHERE. The story was slow and needlessly descriptive in so many places, I ended up skimming a quarter of the novel. I definitely feel cheated and would suggest skipping this novel in favor of Tartt's other, far more successful work, The Secret History."
2,Nancy Drew meets Harriet the Spy in beautiful prose,"Disappointing 500+ pages of gorgeously written but improbable and uninteresting story. Too bad the main character is 12 and named Harriet. I could not suspend my disbelief long enough to believe a 12 year old would engage in most of the activities I read about for hundreds of pages. I kept hoping a real story would emerge amongst the masterfully developed elderly sisters or the split and saddened family of Harriet. After the intense and complex psychology of a Secret History I found the motivations, antics and ""suspense"" of this new book underwhelming and at times formulaic. When she's hiding under a chair we get her view of the floor, if she's in the woods we get a leaf by leaf description, twice we are made aware of the mud rings on the warehouse door - memorable enough the first time to notice them a second time several hundred pages later. If you liked Nancy Drew....."
2,Very disappointing,"I was hooked into the book immediately. I read several books per week, but found this book to be very disappointing. I haven't a clue what this author was trying to tell us. It is unfortunate because the writing and suspense was for the most part superb! The book didn't end....it did not leave you hoping for more (unless you are like me and wanted to understand what the past 700 pages were supposed to climax into!) It has been a long time since I have been this disappointed in a book. If someone could explain to me what Harriet learned from the torture she experienced, I would love to hear from you!"
2,ten years of garbage in the making,"I thought the book was very messy. You find emotions being forced onto the page which doesn't help at all. It is a labour to get on with it and at one point picked up war and peace and thought ""maybe"". Then i put it down again and thought it through. My conclusion was, do not buy this money making future film. it's a good flu/aeroplane/trashy read and no more."
2,Tartt should fire her editor.,This book was incredibly long without needing the long drawn-out pages upon pages of desciption. I honestly think 100 pages could have been cut out without damaging the plot in any way.The title has nothing to do with the story and neither does the creepy doll head photo on the cover. I kept waiting for some chuckie-like character to be introduced to explain the hideous cover. Now I know why this book was in the bargain bin.
1,4 hours of my life I want back,"Yuk. A mystery which is never resolved, boring, one-dimensional characters, and unbelievable events."
1,overwrought and overrated,"A rock-bottom book that features a tinkertoy plot, derivative characters, and purple prose. This book manages the neat feat of going on forever and getting nowhere. Was there no editor, or was he/she simply ignored? To keep your dignity as a reader, get the real thing from Eudora Welty, Flannery O'Connor, Barry Hannah, Richard Ford or ol' Bill Faulkner."
3,Mixed up childhood,"Hard to follow up a novel like ""The Secret History"". I think if i hadn't read that book first then this one would've given me a great deal more satisfaction."
2,Not up to expectation!,"Count me among the HIGHLY disappointed. The Secret History is one of the best books I've ever read. The Little Friend, however, left me feeling very cheated, mad that I'd spent time getting involved in the lives of characters that went nowhere. IMO Ms Tartt is a talented writer. Her descriptions of character and events are vivid. Reading this book was like a winding train journey in which the train hits the brakes before reaching any recognizable destination.If you loved Secret History as much as most people, you'll have to see for yourself, but save a few bucks. Borrow a copy."
2,where's the ending?,"Reading a 550 page book can sometimes be a little daunting yet this book entertained me enough to continue only to reach the end and find that there wasn't one. Ms. Tartt certainly is an able writer but to leave the reader hanging after so many pages was a turn off. I didn't read her first book and now, though the critics raved, will probably skip it after being so disappointed with the conclusion (or lack there of) of this one."
2,What a shame!,"Okay, first, don't read this if you don't know the ending...oops, what ending? You read 555 pages to never find out who the murderer is. The shame of it is, the book is so well written, but there is no closure to this book at all. Donna writes so well and this book had me as engrossed as The Secret History did, but I really feel now, that I wasted a lot of time reading this. And oh, one last question....Who is The Little Friend that the book is titled after??"
1,The Little Bore,What a disappointment! Too long and embellished. Where was her editor? Several little mysteries were contained in this book - none of which was answered. Don't waste your time.
1,wtf?,"as a teacher, i can only wonder, which book was written by ms. tartt: TSH or TLF? clearly, they were not written by the same person. i stumbled upon TSH a few months ago, and felt like i discovered something special, and i did. TLF is the least entertaining book i've read in a while. i would like a refund."
4,I didn't realize I had enjoyed such a bad book!,"Lesson learned here. This was a stay-up-late good read to me. I am so very glad I didn't see these reviews from disappointed readers before I started TLF. I might have missed out on one of the most enjoyable reading experiences I have had in a while. I thought the character development was excellent. And as for ""who done it"", I think it's pretty clear what the author was aiming for here... and I was not one bit let down. Just the opposite."
3,what happened to the last chapter?,"While yes, this book is written with beautiful style and captures pitch-perfectly life in the South in 1970, I must say how disappointed I was when I got to the end. I thought there was a mystery to be solved! When I got the last page, I had to check to be sure someone hadn't ripped out the final chapter; it was as if the book ended in the middle of a conversation.Nevertheless, the characters and descriptions are rich and vivid. Worth a read, but don't expect any resolution in the end."
5,Looking Back,"Going thru my bookshelf deciding what to move on, I came across The Little Friend and looked it up to check out Donna Tartt's other books. I discovered that I had read both but was amazed at the negative reviews on The Little Friend. Looking back I can tell you that it was one of the most riveting books I have ever read. Also, it is one of those books that you never forget. (I had forgotten that I read The Secret History, in my opinion a far inferior story that this one.) When she describes the symptoms of meth use you totally feel it. That did it, it went back on the shelf for a repeat read. Great book, people! I suggest you ignore the bad reviews and check it out!"
2,"Sorry, Ms. Tartt","First of all, I absolutely LOVED ""The Secret History."" So, I'm quite saddened to dislike this novel as much as I do, because it really does start off really promisingly. (As promisingly as it can, considering it starts with a murder of a little boy.) Yes, it's really well written. Yes, it's quite moody and the characters are all very fleshed out. But Ms. Tartt has her work cut out for her because she expects to keep the reader's interest while unfolding a virtually plotless storyline through the eyes of a twelve-year-old girl: not an easy task for over 600 pages. Do not be fooled by the jacket cover: this is NOT a murder mystery and there will be no big moment of ""AH-HAH!"" in the end of it. Just more moody, broody, albeit lovely, writing."
1,How can something so beautiful be so unsatisfying?,"They say beauty is only skin deep. Can that adage apply to literature as well as people? The Little Friend would seem to prove that it can. Donna Tartt has outdone herself producing chapter upon chapter of exquisite, tasteful, occasionally insightful prose. But to what end? After so much bounty, one feels empty and at a loss as to why. Perhaps that was Tartt's literary intent (though I would tend to doubt it). Perhaps she simply got lost in the rapture of creation. Either way, The Little Friend is a stunning disappointment. It's all style with a paucity of substance. Perhaps she thought no one would notice. That remains the true mystery of The Little Friend. And Tartt's motivation is the enigma."
2,"Beautifully written, without a plot","After waiting 10 years for Donna Tartt to write another book, I alternate between being sorely disappointed in this, and vastly impressed by her beautiful prose. Though the writing is splendid, the imagery vivid, and the characters are sublimely developed, the plot plods along at an interminably slow pace, and the ending is atrocious. By the 555th page, the reader would appreciate having an ending, but Tartt refuses, merely ending the book wherever she saw fit, with absolutely no point whatsoever. This doesn't hold a candle to her debut novel, ""The Secret History."""
1,I want my...money back!,"I've never written a review online before, but I just had to try and stop any other massive Secret History fans wasting [$$] of their hard earned money on the most boring book I've ever read in my life (well, one of them.)The characters are incredibly cliched, the story is non-existent and the ending - well, it just sort of tails off lamely (although even this comes as a relief after about 800 pages of overwritten waffle.)I had to see if any other Amazon readers hated it as badly as I did, and was pleased to see that the majority did...Again, I loved the Secret History big time - but this book bears about the same resemblence to that as Little Nicky bears to Citizen Kane.I cannot warn you strongly enough. Do NOT waste your money."
1,The worst book I've ever read,"After finishing this very tedious and overly-hyped book, I am convinced that the book that I purchased had the wrong book jacket on it. While I thought about giving up on it everytime I opened, I stuck with it figuring it must get better. Unfortunately I seemed to have missed the climax AND the closure. I can safely say that this is the worst book I have ever read."
1,Really?,"I would rather have watched the collective work of Uwe Boll in one sitting than have read this book. It would have been just as entertaining and rewarding.The quality of Donna's prose is breathtakingly exact in its measure to elicit an intense expectation that could divine the all...That's how this book feels; a culmination of a message that abruptly stops. I feel as if an omnipotent computer just revealed the answer to life, the universe, and everything is 42."
3,Beautifully written ... but incredibly slow,"As most of the reviewers here, I am a huge fan of Tartt's The Secret History, which I have passed along to numerous friends who have equally loved it. Even though the reviews for The Little Friend were mixed, I still attemped the book. While slow and drawn out, I still kept up with the book. Harriet and her extended family are so vividly portrayed, and Harriet's numerous little escapes are shocking and hilarious. I often found myself laughing outloud. Yet - when there wasnt much dialogue or character interaction, the book became boring and slow. It was such a letdown, since Tartt was fabulous in The Secret History. The Little Friend lacks the suspense and shocking closure that her previous book had."
4,"Compelling, Atmospheric, Beautifully Written","Tartt's a master at elegant prose and characterization, but I am hard pressed to understand why she felt the book should be so long-winded. I finally read this novel even after hearing of some reader's complaints about the resolution because she truly is a magnificent writer and I loved her first book. The opening chapter is stunning and there isn't a person you encounter that you don't fully believe. Not a great novel, but it's still unforgettable and haunting."
2,Enjoyed reading it...until the non-end.,"I liked so much of this book. I grew up in the south during the same time period. I've never read anything that captured the atmosphere of my youth like this book. Unfortunately, the ending was such a letdown that it colored the way I feel about the book. I will definitely read her next one and I think she is a good writer. However, I think that fiction readers deserve a payoff at the end and she just couldn't deliver it. What a frustrating disappointment."
3,"Needs edit work, Read ""Mad Light""","I was ok with this however there is considerable need for clean up and a bit of refinment in many places. The central theme is good, well its super, it just seems like it was rushed and all the ""P's and ""Q's"" were not taken care of along with certain areas of not so clear thought. I still say yes to Donna, but a better read is Mad Light."
2,"How can something so long, go.... well... nowhere?","While Donna Tartt is undoubtedly a magnificent writer, ""The Little Friend"" went from beginning to end with little direction and absolutely no continuity. From the get-go the plot seemed simple: a child (a very, very, very intelligent child, mind you) wanted to solve the mystery of her brother's murder which occurred years earlier. The vagaries and wanderings of the plot, however, turned it into something wholly different and somewhat uncategorizable. Not only did the ending lack any insightful connections, but the initially exciting climax ended up hitting the fan with a resounding splatter as well. I finished asking myself two questions: What was the point of the novel... and who was the little friend ANYWAY?"
1,DISAPPOINTED,"I am one of the many lovers of ""The Secret History"" and have, like most of you, waited for Donna Tartt's new book for 10 years. To say I'm disappointed is almost an understatement. ""The Little Friend"" is a boring book with dull characters, filled with stereotype after stereotype. The story goes nowhere, and as the reader it is hard to stay interested or concerned about any of the characters, especially Harriet! I have to force myself to read it everyday and I'm not sure if I can even finish it. I've tried to give it chance. I wanted to love this book. What happened Donna Tartt??"
2,I'd been waiting (but apparently not long enough),"Okay, it's been said before, but bears mentioning again: The Secret History this ain't. The languor of childhood in general, and Deep South rural childhood in particular, are brilliantly drawn. But that's all that's brilliantly done here, and a careful mapping out of stasis is awfully little to get out of a long, long book. The stabs at real plotting peter out again and again, and a fair amount of the writing is filler, distraction to get from one set piece to the next. I still can't wait to read what she writes next, but after The Little Friend, my anticipation is mixed with a little trepidation."
5,Expert and hypnotic,"I've never even considered writing a review before, but having read the ones posted I had to add my dissenting voice...I thought that this was one of the most luscious and expert pieces of writing I've ever read. Granted, the first few pages are inauspicious, but the dialogue, the characters--I don't know, I found them completly convincing and absorbing. In fact, I'm probably doing this out of sheer demented exhaustion, since I haven't been able to put this down for a couple of long nights, and probably tossed and turned from a creepiness I usually hate in a book, but really respected here for it's ability to drag me by my feet into a totally unfamiliar world, to make me respond to characters I have no business understanding.I liked The Secret History a lot, but it was very much a first novel; the characters were really entertaining but, to me, completely unreal. What a difference a decade makes in this writer's ability to create people! To each her own, but I loved it."
2,Fake Faulkner,"We all bought the book because we all loved The Secret History. At the tender age of 29 I'm suspicious of anything contemporary, but Tartt wrote a wonderful book once; if nothing else, I was curious of the follow-up.It wasn't apparent from the start. It was only after a hundred pages or so, that I realised that before Tartt began to write The Little Friend, she had swallowed in large quantity, then digested, and then regurgitated most of rather well known books by William Faulkner. It doesn't matter that her style resembles nothing of The Snopes saga (no, of course it doesn't - her style is flat, listless; Faulkner's was brilliant, bold, poetic) it is the characters that sound strangely familiar. Did Tartt really think no-one would notice? But apparently no-one had.Finally - did I really suffer over 500 pages for this?"
1,Didn't make it through half the book!,TO BE FAIR - I can't comment on most of the book (because I couldn't bear to read anymore of it! It may end up being a great book in the end but I never made it there.This is the kind of book that you read the words and then can't remember what you just read. It does not hold your attention. In my opinion this book was slow and boring. I wouldn't waste your money.
1,"Wow, This Books Stinks","I bought it for $1.50 and I really want my buck fifty back. This has got to be one of the most awful books I have tried to read. I can't get past page 40. Honestly, how many pages to you have to use to talk about the same thing but using different words? It seems Donna just likes to show off her use of big words.Don't buy this book...even if you just pay $1.50!"
3,Only three stars.,"Only threes stars because of the hundreds of unnecessary pages, rambling on instead of getting straight to the point.************spoiler - don't read if you don't want to know what happens********************And what the heck is this story really about? Don't kill people because you'll get epilepsy? And who killed robin?I think that since this story was based on harriet thinking danny was the killer, we should've heard more that happened to him in the end. Like what about the priest, and did danny say anything about the girl?Whatever floats your boat I guess."
2,"Yeah, but...","I don't usually demand a fully resolved ending to a book. I don't need everything handed to me on a silver platter, literature-wise. This one, however, needed some resolution to justify how it was constructed.I've heard this novel described as a coming-of-age slice of life, which would be fine, but ""The Little Friend"" isn't written like a slice of life. It's written like a Southern gothic murder mystery, with much loving, beautifully-written detail afforded to subplots that we're led to believe are essential, but ultimately go exactly nowhere.This book doesn't know what it wants to be. One star for the writing, which is great if a little too untrammeled, and one for the interesting characters. I wish I'd passed it by, though."
1,over-the-top prose that smacks of racism and elitism,"I was very eager to read this book after having enjoyed The Secret History - but boy, what a bummer! This book feels like it's 5,000 pages long and very familiar. It's like a campy pastiche of cliches from other famous, better books. Even the main character's name seemed contrived - Harriet Cleve Dufresnes, how is one supposed to pronounce that? I am relieved to see that other readers noticed the slightly racist tone of parts of the book. I would like to add that there is classism at foot here too - i.e. Tartt's reprehensible portrayal of the white trash characters, used primarily as comic relief. I wonder how Tartt would feel if she were on the receiving end of that. There is a noticable lack of humanity in these pages that results in boredom. Ten years to produce what? A faux great novel. Can't recommend it, sorry. I hope she get sher act together again. It's just a cryin' shame."
2,Exasperating Ending,"I picked up this book by chance at the library, and based on the summary, I thought it was going to be a great book. It was a slow starter, but I did develop and attachment to the characters and the plot was very intriguing. It grew boring in certain spots and I would actually skip a few pages ahead in the book until I found something a little more exciting. I was really looking forward to the ending to find out ""who done it"", and have never been so disappointed in my life. The books end very abruptly and I really thought I had missed something. I went back and read over the last couple of pages again to make sure but there is no closure to the plot. The ending was exasperating and I am angry I wasted my time reading this book."
3,GRRRR....Feeling Ripped Off,"I actually really enjoyed this book until the end...would it have killed her to put in another chapter??? To give us a real and decent ending??? There were so many loose ends, undeveloped plots/characters, What did Alison remember? After 600 pages, I wouldn't have minded more in order to not feel like I just stopped reading 2/3 of the way through. That said, the writing was lush and rich and slow; she really captured the sense and ecccentricities of the old deep south and our families' strange histories. This was an interesting story about the legacy of heinous crime -- the expectation, given the plot, was that this was a combined whodunit, coming of age, and southern class/race social commentary. It was not; it ended up being a puffy, overdone, overly symbolic--the snakes, puhleese---excercise in English 101 or literary group discussion fodder. Very sad given the promise until the very end...."
3,And the point is...?,"I haven't read The Secret History yet, but apparently I should have started with that one. I was really intrigued by this book at first, but it is entirely too wordy, with many sections that just don't need to be there at all. And I'm still trying to figure out what the title refers to..."
1,How awfull!,"At the outset, I have to state that Secret History was one of my favorite books. When so many years later, I heard that Donna Tartt was not a Harper Lee, I was truly excited and eagerly anticpated this release. Now I wish she had been a ""one hit wonder."" What an awfull book. I have struggled through 3/4 of this thing, trying not to be defeated by it's pompous and irrelevant description, lack of plot, and ultimate letdown (while reading this monstrosity, I have completed three other very satisfying books). Tartt starts off with a promising premise, but gets completely bogged down in self-indulgent descriptive asides that make this novel infuriating to read. I don't think one ever finds out who killed Robin, and quite frankly, I don't care..."
1,what happened?,"Is it the price of fame that a talented young writer gets forced to publish something in the hopes of topping his/her initial success? Is it our commercial capitalist culture that thinks the public will just eat it up? How did the smart authoress of The Secret History come up with this flaccid, downright campy second effort? Was Miss Tartt under that much pressure to produce? Some writers only have one book in them. That could be the case here. Whatever the circumstances, The Little Friend is not little - and it's nobody's friend. If you want Southern Gothic, stick to Capote, a true original. Tartt's treading water here, trying hard to come up with her next cash cow. She strikes out on all counts. Maybe she should pen a memoir and explain what happened. Might be more interesting."
2,Hooks you then leaves much to be desired.,"I loved The Secret History, so when I heard that Donna Tartt had a new book out I decided to check it out.I liked the beginning of the novel. About 200 pages in it was a struggle to force myself to read more of it...the end gets a little better but offers little in the way of resolution. I just expected more. The parts of the book about the Ratliff family are especially mindnumbing.I will say that Tartt is an excellent writer, and the only reason that I gave the book even 2 stars. She creates such beautiful sentences and paragraphs, but fails to make much of a story. By the time I finished the book I didn't even like Harriet, let alone any of the other characters in the novel.Also, I REALLY wanted to find out what happened to Robin but his murder is barely talked about past the prologue."
1,Less is more,"Seven months ago I put The Little Friend on my Christmas wish list and was thrilled when I received it as a gift. Seven months later I finally finished it and I think I owe my gift giver [$$$]! If this book was brilliant, I sure missed it.Everything about this story was long and torturous. The sun-baked Mississippi landscape, the bible thumping, quasi-racist, emotionally clueless characters, the crazy-...premise and the anti-climactic climax which was no climax at all since that would imply a building of tension and action that begs for a resolution. Suffice it to say that 20 pages from the end, I was able to put the book down for the night and not pick it up again for two days, that's how much I didn't care about Harriet and the fate of her family.I can say a lot more, but like The Little Friend, what's the point. Less is more. Read the first chapter, the last, and that's all you'll need. Everything in between is boring, long winded, depressing, and completely unnecessary."
2,"I must be missing it, too","I certainly enjoyed Secret History and waited months to get my hands on The Little Friend--boy, am I glad I got it from the library instead of paying for it! I've been reading it non-stop for the past few days and now, exactly halfway through it, it's boring the hell out of me. What's with the snake obsession? I understand that fondling them is a big deal in some religious rites, but are they supposed to be a metaphor for the evil Ratliff family? If so, I get it already! The excruciating--and nearly senseless--detail of the Odums and Ratliffs was so inundating, I felt it really took away from the momentum. I even skipped to the end of the book, which I hate doing, just for a reason to keep going. But even then, it was so convoluted that I fell asleep. I'll try to to finish it, but it's going to be difficult. If you need a sedative, feel free to wade through this tar pit. Otherwise, I wouldn't bother."
2,The Book With No Ending,"After diligently reading the over-descriptive pages and pages and pages of this disappointing book (I loved the Secret History), I was angry at the ending which left the reader hanging with nothing but questions to ask the author. Talk about FRUSTRATING!!!!! What happened to Harriet? How about her parents? Did they go back with each other? Who killed her brother? Did Harriet really have epilepsy? Did the police ever find out what happened? I agree with some of the other reviewers that the character descriptions were well-written but they led you nowhere and the book was entirely too long because of these. And the question of the year.....What the heck does the title mean? What's with the doll? Who's the ""little friend"". Arghhhh! Sorry, Donna. Can't recommend this one. Try again."
3,Needed more focus,"I have to agree with many of the reviews that this was an extremely long book (uncecessarily so). I felt that much of the story did not flow and thought she is an interesting writer, I often found my mind drifting. I think this book could have certainly been significantly shorter. Plus, I did not feel that the events in the ending fit well into the inital incident of Robin's murder. I feel that book definitely needed more focus and some serious editing to cut down on the content."
4,A Southern Reality Book,"The characterizations are superb. I will read it again and enjoy how well the author drew these differing portraits. I would have been delighted if there had been no story at all. The plot was preposterous--what I would expect in the juvenile adventure section of a library. However, that did not spoil the richness of the characters. Any writer would gain immeasurably by reading how Donna Tartt drew, painted in, shaded, highlighted, etc. these unforgettable southern people. A Reality Show between book covers. Adult plotlines and development will come--once she puts her mind to it. Read the book, ignore the plot. Enjoy the fantastic people."
2,WHAT??,"I can't really say anything that hasn't already been said here except that the ending was horrible; very unsatisfying...there is no real resolution. I also didn't get who ""the little friend"" was either. The book came so highly recommended but I can't believe I just wasted several days reading it."
1,Gad-zeeks! What's going on here?,"Hello? Is anyone home at Harriet's house? What about Donna Tartt's house? This book was really disappointing. Empty characters in empty rooms. Plotless narrative and banal dialogue that leads no where at all. I read an interview with Donna Tartt somewhere after I had finished the book (is there anywhere were she hasn't been interviewed?) and I was astonsihed to read that she said that novels should have something going on in them, that their main purpose is to be entertaining and that there should be a strong plot and an adventure story - and that novels should not pretend to be literary! Is she kidding? Did she read The Little Friend when she finished writing it? Believe me, there is no plot, no adventure and it's not entertaining. Plus, it strains very hard to be literary and it just seems contrived and cloying - just like an Southern woman past her prime."
2,"Long on Characters, Short on Theme","Donna Tartt creates some memorable characters in The Little Friend, and has an uncanny knack for helping her readers to ""see"" the locales in which she places her story. Unfortunately, great characterization and atmosphere do not a great book make. The coming-of-age epiphany at the end of the story falls flat in the face of hundreds of pages of build-up. From a writer as skilled as Ms. Tartt, I expected much more."
1,A guarateed cure for insomnia,"In nearly 40 years of reading, I can count on two hands the number of books I have NOT finished. I can now add ""The Little Friend"" to that not so illustrious list. And why you may ask... simple, I could not stay awake while attempting to slog through this incredible bore of a book. Overwrought, overhyped and worst of all, overwritten, this novel gives new meaning to the word tedious. With so many excellent books out there waiting to be read, do not waste one moment of your time on this fiasco."
3,"What ""little friend"" was that?","Not sure who the title is celebrating, nor who's responsible for the event that sets the story into (very slow) motion. Don't have answers for the many complex questions surrounding the characters at the end. A great deal of time was spent setting up a gripping climax, but instead of closure or some decent denouement, we're left with even more horrific threats looming. This could work in a short story, but a 555-page journey should do more than depress and bore the traveler. Couldn't help asking all the way through, where in the world is the editor? The author has many skills (as proven in The Secret History), but here we're asked to plow through endless, repetitive descriptions that add nothing to the ambiance or plot. I often love long books, dense with description, but invariably I feel I've gained something from the experience. Here the fate of cast and audience alike seems to be disappointment."
3,Second novel,"This is Donna Tartt's second novel. Her first novel, Secret History was really very good indeed and received excellent critism from the press. This novel is not up to the standard of the first but still a good read."
3,Ultimately disappointing,"Having read The Secret History many years ago, I was expecting this book to be similarly breathtaking. It starts with an interesting premise: the suspicious death of Harriet's 9 year old brother and her later desire to find the killer. However, somewhere along the way the story meandered so far into intense minutae I began to wonder exactly where it was all going. Strong character development and a very evocative sense of time and place resulted from all this minutae, unfortunately so did boredom. The ending was abrupt, somewhat thought provoking but ultimately unsatisfying. I do see what the author was trying to get at, however, from reading the synopsis on the back of the book I think I was expecting something different altogether. Something more focussed on the brother and the circumstances of his death."
4,A little friend,I have to say that I loved this book. I didn't want it to end. she is a wonderful writer.I was a bit frustrated at the ending but I was okay with it. I miss the book now that I am finished with it.
2,"Lots of Promise, but......","This book is a paradox. I actually listened to the audio version read by Donna Tartt. She does an excellent job. The story starts out well and then about a quarter of the way through I found my mind wandering and would have to go back and listen again. Made it through to the end, but like most everyone else, it left me flat. I am not going to defend the author in regards to the mystery not being solved. We read books (or listen to them) to escape from reality. Yes. Life doesn't always have a happy ending, but mysteries need resolve and she failed to deliver. Now, Donna Tartt is a fine writer. At times she did remind me of Harper Lee. Some of her writing is poetic and beautiful. I have not read her first book, and have no qualms about doing so. I will even tackle her third if she publishes one, but she has got to know that the majority of readers WANT RESOLVE."
3,Publishing deadline?,"I'm mystified as to why Donna Tartt would write such a complex and beautiful book, only to end it with a dull klunk. I never expected the murder to be solved, but I certainly expected the book to be completed. It simply felt unfinished to me."
1,sleep aid,"yawn. yawn. yawn. Doesn't live up to all the hype. I've tried getting into the story several times and put it down in frustration. save your money, folks. get it from the local library if you are interested."
1,The Little Friend,"I called in sick to work to finish The Secret History, that's how good it was...when this book came out I bought the hardback right off the shelf and...Well, I'll just say this...this was one of the WORST books I have ever read. Horrible and oh so boring. If you're thinking about getting this book my advice is just to run the other way or at the very least get it from the library. God, it was terrible."
2,Her Little Friends Are Evidently the Critics,"Imagine ""To Kill a Mockingbird"".Now, take away Atticus.Then, take away a social conscience.Finally, remove any sort of satisfying conclusion to the story.Add 100 or so pages of very dense narrative about very vague characters.Stir in lots of critical hype.You've got ""The Little Friend.""There are a few bright spots. Harriet, like Scout, is an engaging character. The snake hunt has some suspense. The Sunday school and Bible camp passages are fun, as well. However, most of the story seems as unfocused and annoying as Harriet's sister and mother."
4,Don't listen to these people,"People seem to be comparing this unfavorably with her first novel, but the flaws they pick out are aspects of her style that are in the first. ... This is not the first book. It's not set in the same social world, region or age group, but it is a beautifully written novel. The first one was slow (stately?) as this one is, but I found it to be compelling and suspenseful."
5,I adore this book!,Beautifully written and compelling story! I was born and raised in Mississippi and Ms. Tartt's descriptions are perfect. I have lived away from MS for the last 9 years and reading her lush prose immediately transported me home. I highly recommend this book- it is far better than her first effort (which was amazing in and of itself!).
2,"OK, but...","Having loved The Secret History so much, I couldn't wait to read Donna Tartt's next novel, and she certainly made us wait a long time! Unfortunately, this book does not compare to her first, I'm disappointed to report. Her first book came alive and I couldn't put it down; this never really grabbed me and I struggled through it. If you're looking for a great book, pick up a copy of The Secret History instead!"
2,Misleading,"The `blurb' on the back of this book leads you to believe this will be a murder mystery about the horrific death of a young child. When you read the first few pages you are gripped by the tragedy and mystery of it. You are primed for a satisfying tale that will ultimately answer the question the book asks in it first pages. Who murdered Robin?Well, I wish I had checked in with Amazon before investing my time into 600 plus pages. If I had done so I would have known that we NEVER find out who killed Robin. Sure, we read about the damage and long-term effects of his murder upon his family but if that's the story you are looking for Alice Sebold will much better serve you with The Lovely Bones.The Little Friend offers no mystery, no compelling tale; it simply meanders aimlessly with stock characters who have no great insight and ultimately give you the feeling of having wasted your weekend."
2,An Organized Trashing??? Hardly,"Dear Lovers of this book: Yes, we who are disppointed DO Get IT.It's a Southern thing. It's about loss of innocence and race and class and laconic summers in small town Mississippi,we just don't think Miss Tartt GOT IT. It's not the writing, it's the storyline which, contrary to rumors in certain graduate English departments, is pretty damned important to a novel.As for me, I am not part of any organized movement,just pissed off. I bought two copies of this book and gave one to someone else and then had to apologize for it. And it was my Mother, who took a degree in literature before most people writing reviews here were even born!'Nuff Said."
1,Wretched,"If this ghastly pastiche (or perhaps unintentional parody) of Harper Lee, Truman Capote and Tennessee Williams had been written by Donna Smith or Donna Jones, it wouldn't have been published. Simple as that. Tartt is a celebrity. Celebrity books get published without any regard to what their merits (or lack thereof) may be.And to all of you who were wondering why this book wasn't edited, the answer again is that it is a celebrity book, and celebrity books aren't edited. The assumption is that they don't need to be: the public will rush out to buy them regardless of how dreadful they may be.The Little Friend isn't literature. It isn't even entertainment."
3,Much longer than it needs to be,"While I can see why some readers enjoyed this book, I did not. One could say it was ""rich in detail"" but another (me) would say it was just too wordy; the detail was wasted on pointless descriptions. After reading two pages that described a mantle and the trinkets displayed on it, I expected something on that mantle to mean something later in the story.....it all meant nothing.I struggled through this book because I hate to put a book down without finishing it, but it took me a long time to read and I read three other books in the meantime.Read THE SECRET HISTORY. That is a book worth reading."
2,Disappointing to say the least,"The Secret History is one of my favorite books, so naturally I had high hopes for this one. I had browsed through it when it first came out and just couldn't catch the wave. I bought it for a couple bucks and am happy not to have paid more than that. I struggled to get through it, was determined that I would, but it was painful and took weeks. There are entirely too many words spent on setting the scene and on characters that don't drive the plot. Then around mid-denouement, the author seems to run out of gas. I also agree with others who have said in their reviews that the book is a rehash of many other books based in the South, that Harriet is a reminiscent of Scout, the pre-teen heroine from To Kill A Mockingbird. I really expected something more original from Ms. Tartt, and for her editors to edit."
2,Am I missing something?,"Unfortunately I tend to agree with the majority of the comments here. I loved TSH and was eagerly awaiting Tartt's next book. I was befuddled when working my way through TLF, wondering if I was missing something...it lacked plot and direction. The characters were great but at the end of the book I was left wondering where the journey had taken me."
3,A decent read...,I really liked this book despite the main character Harriet. The book built up momentum slowly but by the end I couldn't read fast enough. I do suggest that anyone who wants to read Donna Tartt should start with The Little Friend and then read The Secret History. I think you're bound to be disappointed if you read TLF before TSH. And I strongly recommend The Secret History. Its excellent.
4,Oh The Little Friend..,"The Little Friend is a book which most will find pointless. If as you are reading, you are only looking for a resolution much like a James Patterson novel, than it is true that this novel is not for you. You will gain no satisfaction from it. In response to the question posted by the reader from Breinigsville, PA, as to the significance of the title, The Little Friend I believe refers to Danny Ratliff, see page543 (hardback version) about halfway down."
3,It's not THAT bad...,"...but I'm amazed more readers haven't noticed the similarities between this book and Suzanne Cleminshaw's earlier ""The Great Ideas.""A young girl in a small town haunted by the memory of a dead sibling...even the character's names are similar."
2,Very Disappointed,"Like a few of the other reviewers, I also put the book down yesterday and thought to myself - was that a waste of my time? It sure feels like it was ... I still want to know who killed Robin and why? The ending felt more like Tartt got tired of writing and sort of gave up. I wish I had given up 300 pages before..."
4,Really liked this book!,"I was hooked by the very first words. I thought the story was good, but felt like the ending was not really the end. I guess I wanted some answers, but in real life, we know that it not the way it is. In all, I enjoyed the book."
3,Lethargic,"No question, Donna Tartt can write. The problem is she has a tendency to overwrite. So this is a beautifully written, turgid book, with a great premise that goes ... nowhere in particular. The characters are not particularly likable or sympathetic, the pacing is slow to ponderous, and the book just goes on, and on, and on--seemingly forever. There's no clearly defined sense of time. Is it the present, or is it the past? References to Beatniks and old cars confuse the era, as do mention of things very definitely of the past and other things of the present. If you're looking for something with a viable resolution, this is decidedly not the book. It's a two-star novel, with an extra star thrown in for the author's talent as a writer--not for her ability to leave the reader with any sense of satisfaction. Had her previous novel not been such a great success, it's hard to imagine any house being willing to publish this one."
3,"Little Friend, Big Images","Donna Tartt is a writer's writer. Her image is amazing, her characters provocative. She's not afraid to go in to dark places, which is precisely why I enjoyed reading this book. Structurally she gets a way with murder and the important reviewers, New York Times, etc., seem not to notice.Elizabeth Appell, Author of LESSONS FROM THE GYPSY CAMP"
1,A little too frozen for this amigo,"Absolutely terrible. It kills me that Tartt could have strayed so far to the back of the freezer to pull this one out, knock off the ice and stick it in the microwave.As I read this absolutely boring book, it reminded me far too well the feeling of pain one gets after eating a freezer-burned burrito. The torture of acid reflux as it creeps up your throat, causing excrutiating pain in both your chest and back.Unfortunately for me -- however bad this book is, much like the fact that I will eat another burrito, I'll probably buy another Tartt."
3,No fish burps but hurt to swallow,Loved not having those disgusting fish burps but the pill itself is so hard it felt like it was tearing apart my esophagus.
3,Pictures from the revolution,"Of all the things changing in the world today, few are as accepted globally by more people than the microchip and the electronic devices powered by microchips. Yes there are those we do not own a computer, and vow never to own one, but even those individuals use the microchip as part of their everyday life; whether it be in the car they drive, their household appliances, the electronic doors at their work, or just waiting at an intersection for the cross sign to change. This book documents, with big pictures, the extant to which computer chips are used in various facets of life around the world; and not just in rich countries, but in poor ones as well. The text is fairly easy to read, and gives just enough information on how microchips are made to convery the basic ideas. Overall, a good book, and better than other books of this type."
2,Did not work right,"The product is quite alright, I guess.The particular piece just didn't work right beyond the first couple of times I switched. After which I just kept getting beeping noises. Have returned it.. and expect refunds etc. Will probably get some other solution."
1,STUPID,This is quite possible the dumbet movie I have ever seen. Turned it off 20 min in.Do not bother with this movie. And I like Bill Engvall
3,Corny Fun,"The plot is predictable and corny, about a big monster fishing store opening across the road from the struggling mom and pop store. Smug and cocky fishing champ and owner of the new store constantly rubs mom and pop owner's face in his failures. The language and content is quite family friendly (which is why I bought it). And, I don't need to tell you how it ends, because it's really, as I said earlier, predictable. But, in spite of all that, the acting's not all that good. It's still fun."
3,Dumb,"The movie stars Jeff Foxworthy and is typical of the type of movies comedians make. It was mildly entertaining and my husband liked it because he likes the comedian. So, for that reason I gave it an ""It's OK"". Nothing bad - just stupid. Families can watch it, if they are so inclined."
1,Horrible movie!,This movie is Billy rays worst role ever! He plays a total Jerk and this movie wasn't even funny at all. If you want to see something with him in it for the whole family Buy Hannah Montana season 1 instead
2,Very disappointing,"I could not believe after reading the wonderful reviews on this book, how incredibly bad it was. It had only a very few of the over 3000 Bible baby names. If you are trying to find a ""new"" name from the Bible for your child, look elsewhere."
4,Full of Concrete ideas,"I'm not sure why this book got such a harsh review. It is true that every photo references the company that created it but why is that a bad idea. It makes it easy to get more information if you like the color or want to hire the person who did it. We acid stained our own floors and it came out great. Prior to buying the products we sought this book for ideas on what color stain to buy. It served that purpose well. There are plenty of concrete ideas for counters, floors and fireplaces. This is NOT an instruction manual, it offers no information on how to duplicate the photos that you see. If you buy it for inspiration only you will be satisfied."
4,X Men,I enjoyed watching X Men and wanted to own all three. It is great to be able to buy the box set. I cannot wait to have an X Men marathon including Wolverine.
2,im really not happy with this box set,"i buy these items from you just for the digital copies, im informing you that the code that i got for x-men the last stand, does not work im really vex...the minute something starts to go good you all mess it up...i will like to get a code that works please"
3,An uneven trilogy with a bizarre finale,I would have preferred it if they had stuck with Bryan Singer for the final movie. While I appreciate the increased action of 'The Last Stand' the high concept story left me more confused than I prefer to be for a superhero movie.
5,Blu-Ray Review,"Well, you know how good the movies are, so the big question is 'is the transfer worth the added expense of buying blu-ray?'. The answer is yes.The transfers are crisp and clear and wonderful in their visual detail. The sound is revelatory. The packaged price saves you money. That should be all you need to know."
3,beware of the digital copy,"This rating is for this set and not on the movies themselves....If you buy this set as a way of having it on your PC or ipod beware that the digital copy expired back in April 2011, and the codes will not work anymore, for that reason I feel the price should be even lower because it is as if your buying a used copy of a movie. Or amazon.com should work with the studios and give the purchaser a new code to use with their order."
1,Where are the extras?,"X-Men 1.5, The X-Men Collection, and X-Men The Last Stand (Collector's Edition) are all packed with DVD extras. The X-men Trilogy is missing most of ""fun"" stuff collector's are looking for. If you just want to watch the movies this is a great buy. If you like all that nifty bonus material (ex. Wolverine/Deathstrike Fight Rehearsal an In-Depth Behind-the-Scenes Exploration) stick with other separate releases."
3,"Good movies, lackluster box set","First its only fair to say that I don't actually own this. However these are good movies. I want a box set of the 3 movies but I don't want this one. I want the best and most complete version of the movies available with all the extras, this set does not meet this expectation. I want the whole Xmen 1.5, X2, and X3 Stan Lee edition. I want the most out of my box, give me the whole thing and I will buy, so I recommend against the collectors and completists like myself buying this set. However, regular people who just want the movies and don't care about extras much should have no issue with this set at all so go for it if your in that category. Hope that bit of technical info helps someone out."
2,took to long to arrive,the item took almost three weeks to arrive and x men 2 froze in the last few minutes of the movie. other than that the other two are in new condition
2,Boredom looking for stardom ?,"Intra galactical space travel with twisted plots, too long, too boring, too sleepy. Mediocre acting, missing plot continuity and light-years away from STAR WARS quality. If wasting time is not your goal, don't waste the money !!!!!"
5,X-Men Trilogy [Blu-ray],"AMAZING PACKAGE!!!!. GREAT PRICE!!!!!!!I had to have this as soon as I saw the price and the content. Great BR quality, IMPRESSIVE extras, and again, the price is crazy.Comes with the movies, a disc of extras and a disc for digital copy.I never thought in get these movies but is a good deal. I couldn't let it pass."
4,Satisfactory,The set of DVDs arrived on time in its original packaging but appeared to have been sat on or something.
3,fun action,"The idea of mutants and humans is great. And the film is obviously at a specific public that will enjoy such movies and soundtrack.It's a fun trilogy - but as with most trilogies, the quality goes downhill.The first X-Men was really enjoyable, while the next two were mediocre in quality; it shows even in the actors' performances.Patrick Stewart, in the third installment of X-Men, particularly looks as if he were computer generated, it's that pathetic and bad.In any case, it's fun, action-filled, and it's got a good cast. The movie is worth watching just for that."
5,good service,my product had a little trouble getting to me for whatever reason but when i e-mailed amazon about it they immediately resent another that got to my house in 1 day. they were very nice about it and i was very satisfied with my product. thank you
3,It's Okay,"It is nice to have a box set of X-Men's main series. But the case for each dvd is cheap made. They have the X-Men Quadrilogy which include X-Men Origins: Wolverine but it does not include X-Men: The First Class. For Wolverine series, it will have a new film in 2013 and The First Class series, it will have a new film in 2014. Hopefully they will have the Wolverine series and First Class series box set in the future since I don't want to purchase it again."
5,Awesome.,I love these movies. I'm happy to have the entire collection now. They arrived on time and undamaged and are fully functional.
2,The box was made from poor materials,"The box was made from poor materials, however, the movies were great!"
5,The Best Trilogy Ever!!!,"X-Men, X-Men United and X-Men ""The Last Stand"" are simply spectacular! The cast,the characters, the special effects, the story, the action scenes,and everyhting else seems to work to make these movies the best movie trilogy ever!!!.I have seen lots of movies in my life, but nothing compares and comes close to X-Men."
2,Grossly Incomplete,"1) This boxset does not include X-Men 1.5, just the single-disc barebone release of X12) This does not include the two-disc edition of X2, just the single-disc barebone version.3) There will eventually be a two-disc version of X3.4) Ummm... you do realize that a bunch of new X-Men movies under the moniker of ""Origins"" are being made, right? Why not wait for a box that includes ALL of the movies?This is basically the X-Men equivalent of the Batman Legacy... wait for the Anthology."
4,"Excellent movies, decent package","I'm not particullary a big X-Men fan, anyway I decided to buy this saga 'cuz I enjoyed a lot the third part. But I must say that buying this combo is exactly like buying each movie separately. No extra discs, no nice envelope. Well, it is just fair for people who liked X-Men but not for collectors."
3,Overall Value for money,"In Short, great movies and glad to have the trilogy. The cases for this particular set is rather cheap but at this price, what'd you expect. In the end, you still have the movies!"
5,Catching up before latest X-men movie,I never really watched any X-men movies until now I wanted to get caught up before the latest release.This collection is awesome. It kept me captive the entire time it kept my interest. If you an X-men fan & don't have any of the first three dvd's get this box-set.
2,Its Ok??,Im going to rate this product based off of the quality of the set rather than the movies as everyone can have different opinions on the movie. The package of this set is kind of cheap and seems like not much work was put into it. The 3 movies are in seperate cases which is ok. The only good thing I can say about this is that you get all 3 films together for a decent price. There really is no thrills about the set though.
1,"The movies are great, if only they worked",The DVDs do not play on my player. I know the player works because all of our other dvds play on it. I also was unable to use the digital copy because the codes were used.
3,X-Men Trilogy,"Of course I love all three movies, but this particular packaging of the three movies is deceptive and disappointing. The first disc with the first movie is in HD, but the the other two movies are in SD. Who the heck would want that combination of formats? In effect is forces you to buy more products in order to get the second and third movies in HD. Don't buy this on line, because the only way to know about the formats of the second and third movies is to read the box. What a waste of my money and time."
1,NOT Carl Hiaasen,"This guy writes like he sat down to reproduce the Hiaasen formula, unfortunately without Carls' talent. It's not funny, it's not believable, it's not even interesting.What a sad third rate imitator."
3,Do I have the patience to want to sit down with this??,"No-but, hey, to each his own. Right? Honestly, a very comprehensive book(much like a high-school science text book...outstanding). All meat with no potatoes. If you're studying to go into the field of engineering as a living or are an electronics genius, this review is sheer blaspheme. If you want to make good music on your home studio, get The Musician's Guide to Home Recording and a good dose of spirit- then press record. Peace."
4,Gearwrench review,"The overall quality on this wrench set is great. I also like the fine ratcheting. You only have to move the wrench a few degrees to get a ""click"". My only negative comment is the overall thickness of the wrench itself. In most cases it's not an issue, but the wall thickness on the ratcheting box end can be an interference when a nut is in close proximity to something else."
5,Great easy to read book on how to get the most out of your living.,"I purchased eight copies of ""Get the Best from Yourself"" and sent them to young people to help them to gain insight into themselves, to help them to learn how to interact better with others and to help them to receive the best positive responses from their actions."
3,"Great, but small","It's made by Icon, so the bag is really well made. The magnetic tabs and everything are great, but this bag is SOOOOO TINY. I ended up getting the Urban tank bag they make so that I could take my laptop and shoes with me."
4,Bag for my KLR650,"Nice size bag for a medium-sized bike. Magnets stay on tank, and zippers are easy to use. I can get lots of stuff in this tank bag. I have not experienced any problems as of yet."
2,"Good concept, but hard to see readout","I purchased this for my 12 year old who is a runner. I was hoping he would be able to use it to clock his running times, and use it for general purposes, too. However, the digital readout is really hard to see, its dim. And if you turn the watch to a certain angle, its impossible to see the time. There is a light that illuminates the face, but it stays on for approx one second. I don't think we'll be keeping the watch. The video clip on the listing shows a fairly accurate picture of the watch and its display. I should have paid more attention before ordering."
3,Worked for 30 Months,"I bought this watch as a daily beater watch. It has a light, dual time, stopwatch, timer, cadence, two alarms. It worked, but wasn't anything special. The watch itself is a bit thick due to the plastic styling. I had the cloth band and I'm disappointed in it. The velcro came apart at the clasp, and even a routine of careful washing can't keep the band from smelling terrible.My watch became unusable due to water immersion. It started leaking slightly in the shower, and after a 1 meter immersion in salt water, it's effectively dead. I thought the watch was rated to a static pressure of 100M, but it just has ""100 METERS H20"" stamped on the side. The watch LCD screen is currently too dim to tell time from, there is a caking of salt deposits on the inside of the screen, and it's finished.I'm going back to Casio. This survived for 2.5 years, but I'm ultimately disappointed."
4,Thriller It Is,Hunt has excelled himself with this excellent thriller. America's first female president is subject to an extraordinary case of blackmail - the ending will surprise. The fact that Hunt has brings such a sense of realism to the story should not surprise anybody.Afterall Hunt is no stranger to the subject matter of his book. During his career as a spy he has been accused of being a blackmailer and Presidential assassin - true or not - these leave him well qualified to write about the murky intrigues of Presidential politics
2,The book doesn't live up to it's jacket synopsis.....,"After reading the book jacket, I was excited by the prospect of the story. But after starting into the book, I kept hoping that the next chapter would bring some excitement.Generally if I get to the halfway point of a book and am bored, I put the book down. But in this instance, I kept going, holding out hope for a great ending.I was disappointed all around. The ending was anything but exciting and the characters were flat. What was Steve Bentley's motivation (as a big city tax attorney) to do the illegal cover-ups for the Senator? Who knows......I won't waste time on any more Hunt books."
2,Zzzzz,"Bought this in the airport and although I got through it, it wasn't very interesting. I didn't care one wit about any of the characters. It was written so unemotionally, you didn't get to know any of them. Allison, one of the main characters and presidential nominee-to- be, was written as totally stupid and useless without Steve Bentley, the voice of the book and her lawyer/lover. Completely unbelieveable that she was remotely capable of being a senator let alone a presidential candidate. Worse, Hunt didn't even give the pleasure of a twist ending. It's only surprise was that Hunt DIDN'T try to make it anything other than UTTERLY PREDICTABLE. I also agree with a previous review: If I had to hear one more time what they ate for dinner or about the martinis they drank, I was gonna puke. Totally vapid characterizations and writing style. I just plain didn't care so.... A snooze."
2,Ugh!,"I purchased this paperback at the airport, hoping to have a great read on a long flight. Did not happen.I had very high hopes for this book. I had never read the author's work before, but the storyline sounded wonderful.I did not really care for the characters at all. Of course the relationship between the two main characters was so utterly predictable and totally boring. If the author described one more meal between these two, I was going to ask the pilot to open the door to let me out.I cannot recommend this one."
1,Horrifying historical ignorance of netheads,"Isn't anyone going to point out that Hunt was the leader of the team that bugged the Democratic National Committee Headquarters on June 17th 1972? Or that at the time he was working for the Nixon White House as a ""plumber"", plugging leaks for a paranoid administration? Or that Hunt worked for the CIA, recruiting Cuban exiles and training them for not only the Bay of Pigs invasion, but for any number of plots to assassinate Castro? Don't you people pay attention?"
2,Not great,"This is not a true envelope style cargo net. You have to fold it to get the envelope style effect. The net is not very elastic, too wide and a little cheap. I am sure it will hold groceries but I doubt it will do to well."
1,not as advertised by company,"I was in the process of purchasing one of these hammock style nets. I discoverd after opening box's and inspecting 3 of these (thinking they may have made a mistake according to product the company placed in box) that they are not ""hammock style"" at all. check out other reviews. people have found the same result over and over again. NOT AS ADVERTISED!"
1,not like the picture,I have a pt cruiser. This to tooo big to be used in the manner shown. I am going to have to make it work if I can. Big waste.
3,Not quite what I expected but ok,"I wanted a cargo net so when I go grocery shopping the bags don't go flying all over the cargo area of my Mazda CX9. I purchase 2 of these thinking it would give me twice the space to put items. First of all you have to fold these in half to make the hammock net. The stretch cord is kinda flimsy but I just wrapped it twice around the hook I already have. The net itself is also flimsy. There is nothing to connect the bottom of the net so if I want to put items in between the two nets and I don't have something heavy in the nets the items can go/roll under them. I would return them because they are not exactly what I wanted, but my husband threw away the boxes they came in. If you're looking for a sturdy net, this is not the one."
2,Auto Carfo Net,"The pictorial and descriptive information of this rear cargo net does define it's fabrication method. I assumed it was a typical ""bag"" net i.e., closed on 3 sides, open at the top. Not so! It is a flat one piece fabricated net that you install folded, hence when folded you have a net that is open at each end and the top such that your contents could and can spill out of either end of the net. I would not recommend this item."
3,average,Not as sturdy as I had hoped but it does the job of holding bags and milk cartons etc. A little smaller than expected as well. Ok for the cost.
2,didn't fit the car,"I purchased this item as a gift for my mom. She has a Subaru Legacy sedan. According to the description of the product, it fits ""most"" cars. Apparently a Subaru is not on that list. Very disappointing. I have still been unable to find a hammock style net for her car. The only ones available are for the side pockets. I'll keep looking!"
3,It's okay,"This hammock cargo net is a decent product. I wouldn't say it's the best nor would I say it's junk, it's just decent. The net could be used as a hammock by folding it in half or flat down in the trunk. For its purpose it works decently. My complaint is that the netting portion is small, poorly constructed, and not elastic. The bands holding the net is the only elastic part. And the criss crossing pattern on the net is actually glued together instead of being weaved like most nets. This leaves me to question the longevity of the product especially if it's exposed to sunlight. I use carabiner clips to attach the net to my trunk, the net does come with a set of screws and attachable hooks by tape though. An okay product, not bad not good, just okay."
3,Solid but not without deficiencies,"As another reviewer stated, it's a long way down to un-rack and re-rack the curl bar. I usually use dumbells instead of a bar, for just this reason. Also, the bench creaks a little bit given the weight on the pad. All told though, for the price, ease of assembly, and durability, I'm reasonably satisfied."
3,Keep for a slow weekend,"The Face of Justice by Bill Blum is an entertaining story, but marred by a car load of improbabilities. The psychological believability of the main characters is near zero. The plot has inconsistent facts. Nonetheless, it makes for a good reading on a slow weekend or while laid up. Where the book has strength is in its depicting lawyer and court room activities. That is not surprising, as Blum is a lawyer and regarded as a competent appellate attorney and now ALJ. Some of the book's descriptions of settings and scenes are very good also, but fall flat when it all again goes nowhere but into improbabilities. The suspension of disbelief gets stretched too much in this story which tries to remain realistic at the same time. All in all, read it. It is certainly as good a story as most in this genre and better written than the majority. Blum should stick to a simpler story and make the plot support, rather than hinder his strong story telling ability."
5,Best Greek Mythology Fiction!,"YOU CANNOT MISS THIS BOOK! This book really goes into Greek myhtology and it is a story equivalent to Theseus and the Minotaur. I liked the adventure and the vividness of this book. I also love Greek mythology. All information here are 100% accurate.It is about a princess of Crete nemed Ariadne. She was a daughter of King Minos of Crete and Queen Pasiphae. Queen Pasiphae also gave birth to the Minotaur, a half-man and half-bull beast. Athens had to pay 9 youths every seven years to feed the Minotaur. Once, Theseus, the King of Athens' son came to Crete, Ariadne fell in love with him. They danced in the banquet room and later Ariadne helped Theseus to kill the Minotaur by the help of the architect Daedalus. Theseus killed the Minotaur and they at once set sail for Athens with the rescued Athenians. However, Dionysus wanted Ariadne as his bride and Theseus had to leave Ariadne at Naxos. Sionysus became Ariadne's husband."
4,Essential reading for Evangelists,"Although it's over 70 years since this book was first published, it's still worth reading if you are involved in or interested in evangelism. There is no end to the stream of evangelism and ""share your faith"" courses whereby Christians are told how best to present the gospel - usually in some new method of the author's devising. They all claim to base their model on the preaching of the gospel we see in the New Testament. Save your money and energy, bin them all, and read this. Dodd was not writing to promote some new scheme of gospel presentation. The result is no padding and concise discussion of what the Gospel is (if you think the Miracle/Jesus prayer or some other 20th century formula is it, think again!) according to the New Testament, and how it was preached. If you really want to preach the Gospel message, here's a good place to start leaning how!"
5,One of the greatest albums of all-time.,"I can't even put into words how incredible Oasis was and still is. You either get it or you don't. They were a remarkable balance of badass and sentiment. They were endearing musicians and people. They captured the spirit of youth in a way very few ever did or have since. The songs stand up over many years of listening. The melodies are brilliant and the lyrics simple and catchy while remaining creative.Simply put, they were the best."
2,This album wasn't designed for SACD,"I'm a hardcore Oasis fan. I run the website[..]. I just listed to the SACD of this for the first time today after owning the disc itself for over 5 years, after I FINALLY got a SACD player.I must say, I am extremely disappointed in this SACD. Sure, some sounds are separated to different 5.1 channels like they should be, but like one of the other reviewers stated, the vocal is all over the place. It almost sounds like there is an echo or that you are listening to the album live. In fact, some songs are decent, but others are just horrible. The songs where Noel sings tend to be the better ones.And by the way, the SACD down-mixed MP3's of the album floating around on the internet sound NOTHING like the actual SACD. The MP3s actually sound better, not kidding you.I love Oasis, but Sony screwed this one up. Sorry folks! I am not recommending this to buy."
3,Rare SACD disappointment,"I was so looking forward to this release. The masters of these sessions must have been horrible. There's alot of overloading and the channel separation is terrible. Everything is blaring at once, and there's no balance. The vocals are everywhere, and it sounds like he was overloading the microphone. There's no space around the voice.I like a lot of the songs on this album, but this SACD comes off very poorly.I think it's great that the orchestra and some instruments have been isolated in the rear channels and now sound clearer than ever, but the overall sound is still very muddy, distorted, and overloaded.For die-hard Oasis fans with a need to hear these classics in a Multichannel mix."
3,A bit confusing sometimes,"This was an interesting book but it wasn't just about the Cross at Hendaye France. There are a lot of boring parts to this book interspersed with some fabulous information, which the author doesn't elaborate on at all and will force you to do your own research. Apparently the cross signifies the end of time but by the time you get to the end of the book you are scratching your head.The author doesn't know much about the actual cross or it's inscriptions...and apparently nobody does. The author has been researching this cross for 18 years but still doesn't know where it comes from. He links it to south America. Supposedly the cross tells when the world will end. Because there is aa etching of an angry sun on the cross so the author claims that the world will end by fire. The cross was made by an unknown alchemist/master mason..according to fucanelli."
1,"Lord, what fools these mortals be...","First, I paid full price for this hack piece that would make Llewellyn publications look like scholarly tomes. My primary reason for purchasing it was the endorsement blurb by Joselyn Godwin, a well respected esoteric scholar. And all I can ask is why? This convoluted piece of crazed analysis and manipulated gematria that is headache inducing, is a sad work indeed. Millenial nonsense is millenial nonsense no matter what guise it is under, be it a Meso-American calendar, the cryptograms of Nostradamus or Millerite blathering. This work is part of the cottage industry sprung up from the Rennes-le-Chateau, pseudo-Cathar, Fulcanelli ""stuff"". Any Occultist worth their alchemical salt will do well to avoid this numerological & laughable mishmash."
2,Quite boring,"I thought this book would unravel a great secret. It didn't. Rather it contained speculations, and it was quite boring to read. I don't think this book holds much truth."
5,Excellent book,"I was suffering from arthritis and this book gave me a lot of helpful advice, and some simple exercises that did not aggravate my already painful joints, and in fact, helped ease the pain."
1,Just fell apart on me!....,"I recall how excited I was before I had purchased this tripod...just a few minutes ago, I decided to take a shots of an itemI wanted to sell on ebay. So, I took out my camera, and then the Manfrotto 725B so that I""d get a good shot.When I went to raise the center piece, I noticed a 'CRACK"" on one of the support columns. I could no longer us thispiece of S..T crap tripod anymore.Now, I'll have to go down to B&H; in New York City and show the store honcho's my dilemma.And, whats strange is that the crack in what I had thought was METAL appeared to look like PLASTER!..I suggest any of you looking to buy a good tripod, to not buy the Manfrotto 725B.. I'ts made to simplebreak and fall apart on you..."
2,Beware of cheap plastic parts,"I have this tripod and over time all of the bottom leg clamps, which are plastic, have cracked in half, rendering this tripod unusable. Most every part is metal, except the one part that takes a huge pressure when the clamp flanges down. Should be metal. Once it goes, you can tape it up, but super glue will not hold. (I tried, ha)."
5,Great Tripod,Great tripod. Very versatile. Snap off plate is easy to use and locks back in securely.
4,No longer metal joints,"Though this tripod is much better that what one can find in the generic stores, it is less than what I have come to know as the best in the field. The joints are now made of plastic, which seems to be of good quality, but time witll tell. The cheaper models break because of the plastic joints being the weak link. Hopefully, this will not be true for this beautifully light, three pound tripod. I will keep the camera strap around my neck at all times in case the tripod fails."
1,Poor quality,"I bought a similar tripod (the digi 714B) with the same leg locking mechanism. After using it at 2 week long events, 2 locking mechanisms have broken and 2 more have cracked rendering the tripod virtually useless.For an expensive (I paid almost $200) tripod this is unacceptable. Buyer beware."
5,"By far, a true steal for a GREAT item!",This item was recommended by my FLICKR group and it was well worth it. The cost is minimal yet the advantages are huge!It also arrived very quickly and packed very well.
4,Bogen-Manfrotto 725B Digi Tripod,"This tripod is very light and easy to handle, coming in a carrying case. It has a single lever to release the ball which allows the camera to rotate in all directions. You have to take a hold of the camera to adjust it's position. I miss not having a handle to maneuver the camera but I am getting used to it. In the interest of keeping it light, this works well. Overall, I am very pleased."
3,Nice wrenches but large.,These looked to be quality wrenches but they are very large/thick. I could not get the ratcheting end on anything I would regularly use them for (I work on motorcycles mostly). The open end was fine. I ended up returning them.
4,The Right Price,"I needed a video of the Holocaust novel, The Devil's Arithmetic, to show to my class, as we began the unit on the Holocaust. Since teachers are spending so much of their salaries for school supplies these days, I wanted an inexpensive copy. This was it. The video was used, but seems to be in good condition, and I hope it will last me several more years."
2,Pretty Mediocre,"We own and love the Sing the Alphabet, Numbers, Platinum, and Platinum Too CDs. Yet, we found this album, Born to Add, to be almost painful. The first couple of times the songs are entertaining (being song/style parodies of popular music). But since our 2yr-old likes repetition, we play our CDs over and over. DO NOT ATTEMPT THIS with this album!! I think we don't like this album mostly because the songs just aren't that good. We expect a LOT more from Sesame Street--the other CDs mentioned contain some excellent song/style parodies. We are very disappointed in this purchase."
3,Not as Good as Advertised,I bought this for my 10 month old daughter because we just loved Hot Hot Hot Dance Songs and was hoping to find something of similar caliber but this did not live up to that. The songs are OK but not quite as lively as I would like. I appreciated the parodies the first time but it got old quickly. If you are only buying one CD I would definately recommend Hot Hot Hot Dance Songs.
5,Great for Children up to 7 years old,"I bought this CD for my daughter for her second birthday. She loves the music! She wants to take it each week for 'show n tell.' Even I don't mind listening to the music, and it sure beats the Barney songs.I found that her cousins, ages 5 - 9 years old, were able to enjoy this album as well."
3,Hitachi 7k250 performs as expected,"The Deskstar series hard drives have been around a long time. They are commonly found in most IBM branded systems and are known for their great performance abilities. Today we will take a look at one of their latest drives that takes into account high capacity and some of the fastest transfer speeds that we have ever seen! The Deskstar 7K250 250GB Serial ATA hard drive is one incredible drive. Accompanied by the almost silent operation, an 8MB buffer and a 7200RPM spindle, the 7K250 is a choice drive for anyone looking for performance without all the noise.(full review @ bytesector.com)"
5,Continental 80s pop gem.,"For fans of 80s music who never ventured beyond the safe confines of English-language offerings, this CD may be a revelation: the French have pop hooks! And the disc's definitive 80s sound is exactly what makes it so charming--and even essential to a fan of the period. For its day, it was on the leading edge and helped define an entire genre that is fundamentally influential in popular music to this day. Just because music is from a past era does not make it bad. (Just think of the pulp that's being ground out today with at best a one-week freshness expiration)."
2,"Typical, Euro Bee-Bop, Unimaginative","I purchased this album after I heard Daho's music being played at a street CD shop in Paris; it sounded smooth, melodic, and different, so I got the album name and ordered it from Amazon. I stuck it into my car CD player and, well, was very dissapointed. This album is very much like the 80s band OMD, but the lyrics are in French. Each song contains the typical Euro bee-bop synthesizer gunk that repeats itself continuously. There is little, if any, imagination and intrigue to any of the songs on this album; it it reminescient of the stuff I outgrew in junior high school. There is one song (#7) which is okay at best, the rest are really really aweful. Don't waste your money buying this CD, you'll definately be dissapointed."
3,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,AFTER READING ALL THE GOOD REVIEWS I PURCHASED THIS DVD. I TRIED IT TWICE AND THIS IS NOT FOR ME. FIRST OF ALL THEY NEED TO CHANGE THE TITLE. I DID NOT GET THAT PARTY FEELING. THE MUSIC WAS NOT GOOD AND I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED. THERE ARE SO MANY NICE MUSIC OUT THERE SO I JUST DON'T GET IT. THE ONLY FIRM TAPE THAT I HAVE THAT I CONSIDERED FUN IS THE FIRM TOTAL BODY FAT BLASTER (2001) THIS IS A VERY OLD TAPE BUT VERY GOOD. I USE IT VERY OFTEN.
5,Dance that fat away!!,this is an extremely fun video. It features all of the main firm instructors andgives each of them an opportunity to lead the workout. This workout does not invlove weights and therefore is not as hardcore as some of the other firm dvds. It is perfect for a rest day fromthe harder workouts!!
2,difficult to follow if you're uncoordinated like me,"I like many of the other firm dvd's, especially hi-def sculpt and hard core fusion. But I really find this one hard to follow. The moves are very dancey, and make me feel a little silly. I am quite uncoordinated and prefer simpler moves that don't have such a choreographed dance routine feel to them. You'll probably enjoy this routine if you're good at following complicated dance steps, but it's not for me."
4,Great FIRM Workout for recovery days away from weight training,"This is a great workout for a day off from the weights. I am long-time fan of the FIRM and needed something fun and high energy without the weight-training element for my recovery days. This is perfect--it was fun (though the segments were simply a re-filming of cardio routines from other videos)and moved quickly from instructor to instructor keep my interest high. Annie Lee seemed uncomfortable in front of the camera, her segment was less sophisticated and awkward making it a bit of a drag to do--but the other four were quite fun! I wish there had been more of a cool-down/stretch. I can do my own cool-down, but for people who aren't familiar with cooling down on their own the lack of cool down/stretch is problematic and concerning."
3,cardio fiesta,"I'm an intermediate exerciser, and I think this is better for light days. A beginner might find it more of a cardio workout. If you've worked out to other firm dvd's there will be no surprises here. There are 5 ""firm masters"" that each take turns leading a segment. The segments contain their ""favorite moves"" which are typical firm moves, like knee raises, grapevines, mombos, squats, etc. I found the moves easy , but someone new to firm or dancing may have to rewind a few times to catch all the moves. I thought some of the leaders were better at cueing than others. I can understand that they don't want to select music that can become dated, but it is boring. If I kept the DVD, I would eventually turn off the volume and play my own stuff. I took a star off because the cool down lasted for only about a minute. I just did my own stretches. Although I enjoyed doing this workout once, I'm glad that I rented it from blockbuster before buying."
4,Good workout-No equipment needed,"I have long been a fan of ""The Firm"" workouts and this one will be in my workout rotation now too. I found some of the routines a little tricky to catch on to, but with some practice you can learn them. I really liked the rotation between the five instructors, which keeps the workout moving. It can be hard to find a program with no equipment, which is nice sometimes and this one certainly would be a worthwhile buy."
4,Fun workout,"I really enjoy the first three segments of the video, it's really fun and the moves are sequenced well.The fourth segment slows down too much for my taste, and the last segment with the latin dancing takes a few workouts to get down.I also modify by using weighted gloves for greater intensity."
2,Wouldn't know how true this is,"Well, when I picked up this book to read, the first thing I noticed is that this has been marked as 'Non Fiction'. This book was from the perspective of the author - Norma and the incident that changed her life and outlook towards her life.'Forbidden Love' revolves around Norma (a Christian living in Jordan) and her Muslim friend, who she considers as soul sister.This book had lot of facts presented about Jordan and the plight of women there. Being a 'Non Fiction', as the book states it is, I want to believe everything. However, then I read about the author that she has hardly lived in Jordan - specially for the period this book has been peened. This makes me think about the authenticity of her friend and her story. Perhaps few facts/figures may be true, may be they are not."

5,one of my favs,This album takes me back to the good days of music better than almost any other album. Psychedelic dance groovy synth fun music. I love this one
1,The only classic song is a cover song...,"... this is a subtle tip off that this album is not worth buying. Not for more than fifty cents. Like I said, the ONLY good song on here is the Rolling Stones cover ""I'm Free"". And I even like The Soup Dragons' rendition better than the Stones' original. But the fact remains that the rest of this album is a dull drudgery of a mess to get through. This album is practically a single for ""I'm Free"", but with twelve extra songs of filler you'll never listen to more than once (if at all). Hmmm. What else can I say about ""I'm Free""? Oh, yea... the music video for the song is quite awesome. Its so trippy and tie-dyed out! But that still doesn't change my review. Or stoic state of mind.One star out of five."
1,No visible means of support,My Iogear GIC1394 was installed on a Dell Dimension 4700 Pentium 4 running Windows XP. The video capture device was not recognized. Device Manager indicates the card is not supported by Windows XP. System crashed. Spent all night restoring system. I repeatedly submitted requests for support which after 4 days have gone unanswered. What a massive waste of time and $$$. Never deal with IOGEAR.
1,Not worth it,"I bought the flaxseed grinder, in spite of the negative reviews, but those reviewers were right. It takes aproximately 100 twists of the mill to get 1 teaspoon of ground flaxseed. at two twists per second, it would take five minutes of to get two Tablespoons of ground flaxseed (and a case of carpal tunnel syndrome, as well)."
5,Fine Grinder,"I bought this product to grind the flax seed that I sprinkle on top of the Scotties evening meals, and it works just perfectly for that. The grinder turns out a small about of ground seed quickly, and the grinder is ergomatically designed to fit your hand perfectly. The coarseness levels are not clearly marked, but with a couple trials, you can get the coarseness just right. For larger quantities of grinding for baking, I will continue to use my electric mill, but for daily small amounts, this is very convenient. Also, the flax seed that comes with it was fresh and decent quality, which is unusual in most willed spice containers."
1,Good idea but...,Bought this as a birthday gift for my wife since she often uses groung flax seed on her waffles. After the brief excitement of having a grinder we quickly learned that that it takes a long time to get anything out of it. We have since returned the unit.
1,Comes apart - flax rainshower,"I bought the grinder thinking it was electric because I saw the button at the top, but it's not. Also, the button gets in the way of normal use and we've already accidentally pushed it 3 times resulting in a shower of flax. I'm sorry I bought this product."
4,Fresh & Portable Way to Get Your Daily Flax Seed,"I like this product because I can take it with me everywhere. I put it in my purse. I like the nutty taste of flax seeds so I adjust the grinder to a coarse grind. Before I purchased this, I used a coffee grinder, but it grinds the flax seeds to a powder. So when I came across this item, I bought it immediately. However, I have arthritis in my hands and turning the bottle 100 times (I really counted it!) to get a day's allocation is painful. But, I still use it everyday."
2,Slow grinding and carefull handling,It is decent for small quantities else you'll get tired.The worst thing is that it comes apart. It opens right in the middle sometimes....
1,Manual flax seed grinder is slow.,"I was thinking this would be an electric grinder, though the price seemed a little low. It comes with flax seeds, and if it says a serving size is 2 tablespoons, I guess a test might show it takes 15 minutes of continuous hand twisting to grind that serving. Anyway, I returned it realizing it was way too slow for most uses."
3,OK for a tiny topping-->>Go BUY FLAX GROUND by the BAG,This OXO Flax grinder is OK for a small topping and to add some nutty flax taste BUT I BUY IT GROUND by the BAG for $2.50 a bag of groun flax MEAL at stores. YOu would need to grind over 100 turns to get almost 1 tablespoon which is the recommended healthful quantity. It is nice enough looking to leave on the kitchen table and looks like a pepper mill. Mine is fully black unlike the one with the lime green cover pictured on AMAZON ( I got mine at a Sur la Table store).
1,WHERE IS IT?,I have NOT received this item - where is it? When will it get here?Sincerelyrickytroo@yahoo.com
3,"Heroic sailors, not a riveting storyteller","Although this story should be told, a better storyteller is needed. A.J. Hill doesn't keep the tension as high as I am sure it was in that sub. There are too many off topic discussions that draw the reader away from the story instead of giving background information. I was moved more by Terrible Hours by Peter Maas."
4,Shelby's Barken Review,"This wonderful book about Gary and his dog, Cookie, starts here. Cookie is a true leader and loves being a sled dog. Cookie has about three litters a year. In one litter, one pup did not live; Cookie would not let it go until five days! A while after that Cookie and Gary were teaching pups to be true leaders, boy or girl, just like Cookie by running on the Alaskan plain. Cookie started to limp. She had arthritis! The doctor said, "" She would have to give up running as a sled dog!"" Will Gary have to give up racing, too? You will have to read the story and find out. Gary, a main character, is obviously representing Gary Paulsen, the author. I recommend this book to all readers, because it is heartwarming."
3,This is enough. No need to buy the box set.,"You have to be a real lover of Miles Davis's 1960s quintet to buy the multi-CD box of the Plugged Nickel concerts. For me this one CD was more than enough. I haven't listened to it very often so far, because I did not find the improvisations very appealing. The titles are all standards (Milestones, Yesterdays, So What, Stelly By Starlight, Walkin', 'Round About Midnight), and the quintet is very famous for its records like E.S.P., Miles Smiles, Sorcerer and Nefertiti. Still, Plugged Nickel does not work for me."
3,Not bad,"I'm one of the only reviewers here who isn't crazy about this CD. I love Miles, and I love the studio stuff this second group of his did, but this concert is just way too sloppy for me. It's too chaotic. Maybe it's supposed to be that way, and maybe not, but I don't like it. I'll take the Lincoln Center CD any day. Much better as far as I'm concerned."
2,Disappointing,"While Miles' second Quintet was probably the greatest jazz band of the last 40 yrs, this CD doesn't measure up to expectations. This set has very little of the ESP type interplay that you would normally expect from this group. Perhaps they didn't quite know how to interpret the old standards through the new sound. In any case, the songs go on and on without really anything very interesting happening. Shorter blows a couple of interesting solos, but Miles uniformly sucks. Most of the time, he sounds like he's purposely blowing in the opposite direction of the microphone. You can barely hear him. Williams' symbol dominates the mix-- it's really hard to hear anything else clearly. All in all a very disappointing set from a great band. I wouldn't waste your time unless you are a Miles collector. I certainly can't imagine why anyone would want to listen to the complete set of this concert."
2,Beware of music-crit wannabes,"Beware of reviews written by people who think they are music critics or historians. The popular take on this recording is that it gives a portrait of a major step in the development of Davis' music and the quintet that had just formed. Maybe so, but that doesn't make it interesting, and isn't that what your average listener wants? I love the music that came out of the 60's quintet, but here, they don't seem to know what to do with the older tunes. The result is a lot of long, aimless soloing, without any of the interplay that made this group so exciting. Add to that some horrendous sound quality on the first two cuts (Herbie Hancock is barely audible) and this just doesn't cut it. And they released 8 CD's of this stuff?"
4,The Christmas Story:,The Christmas Story: This was a gift. I read it to my granddaughter and it was a little over her head with some of the words. I realize it was of biblical content but if it's a childrens' book it need to reflect a child's language.
4,Straightforward,"Provides a brief rendition of the birth of Christ with great illustrations. Would have been nicer as a board book, since these pages are rather thin. I don't see it lasting very long if our toddler gets her hands on it."
4,Basic Story,It covered the basic story as we all know it and did a good job. The illustrations were OK; Guess I expected a little better artwork. My granddaughter loved it.
4,a good story,"the book arrived on time and is a good story. bought it for my 2-year-old and will replace it with a higher quality copy when she is older. no complaints, though."
2,ok,I was looking for a kids book that explains the Christmas story. It does but I think the word choice is too complex and too old world for my 4 year old. I end up changing some of the sentences as I read so that he understands.
1,Very disappointed,I ordered this for my grandson and I expected a much nicer book than I received. I would send it back but after what I've already paid in shipping and the time it took to receive it it would not be worth it to pay for the return shipping. I'm very disappointed with this whole transaction
2,not my favorite Christmas book,"not my favorite for young children. but it depicts the saviors birth correctly, which i like. maybe it will be a favorite in few years when the kids are older."
5,Good for kids,This is a beautiful book which will help us as grandparents share the true Christmas story with our grandchildren. We like it a lot.
3,THE CHRISTMAS STORY LITTLE GOLDEN BOOK,This book was very short and very small. This book did not give great detail!!!! This is a good book just for an outline of the story. If possible buy another book that gives a better detailed description.
