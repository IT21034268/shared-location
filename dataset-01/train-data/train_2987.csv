3,not very impressed,"There were a lot of insights about specific designers, but not many graphics on more traditional styles - I'm not sure exactly what to make of the ""elegant section"" at all. I was fairly disappointed with the lack of information on how a non-professional could help immerse the professional techniques into their own style, or rather, into a contemporary lifestyle."
5,"Hey, Shawn Watson ""God of Gods""! Why can't you stop!?","First I find you rating 1-star a game (Garfield) that you excused, like saying the controls are mucked up, whoever is voicing Garfield ain't nothing like Lorenzo Music (Sure, whoever voicing the cat ain't nothing like him, but he's dead, lamebrain!That's his new voice!) saying that the graphics are dumb, this is his first time in a 3D game! Get used to it! Now I catch you rating 1-star to this! I had the rom and LOVED it! Sucker!"
2,Not the quality I expected from Melissa and Doug,"One dinosaur makes a good dinosaur sound (roar), the others sound as if they're sick. My son put a couple of the pieces in his mouth and the paint/stickers? came immediately off. Not durable for a toddler. Disappointed and would not buy sgain."
1,Who do they think they are???!!!!,"I can't believe Amazon is letting this company sell this item for $259.99, when you can buy it elsewhere for $59.99. Who do they think they are charging that price?? Go elswhere!!"
5,You need this book if you will be traveling in the Beta Quadrant,"I have to travel to Qo'noS in a couple of weeks. It's a big deal - we will be negotiating the details for an agreement to open a series of KFC franchises there (isn't it funny how gagh tastes just like chicken). Hopefully this book will prevent the kind of error that got my predecessor in trouble (he accidentally said ""May your mother have an ugly neighbor"" instead of the traditional ""May your little enemy have an ugly neighbor"" to the Trade Adviser to the Klingon High Council. It was a mistake anyone could have made but somehow they didn't see it that way.)"
4,"Liked it, but returned.","I liked it, but it was a gift, and ultimately returned. I thought it had a good explanation of basics of klingon language, as well as a big section where words are defined."
5,A very necessary resource,"If you are interested in learning the Klingon language, there are two reference that you must have at minimum. The first is the Klingon dictionaryThe Klingon Dictionary (Star Trek). You will not find a comparable reference on line. The second is this book. This book links the Klingon language to Klingon culture. Since language and culture are intimately intertwined, you cannot fully understand one without the other. I also think in general, you will enjoy Marc's writing style. From it you will get the impression that Klingons are real (at least for us, their language is!). Klingon is currently the second most popular conlang (comstructed language; the first most popular is Esperanto), and there are many creative works (including an opera) in Klingon. So, here's an excuse to start learning Klingon! QaQ jaj! (good day!)"
5,Great Fun! A Wonderful Sharing Experience!,"In this colorful cookbook, sure to catch the eye of the youngest chief, we are taken into a world of delightful, yummy children's recipes.My granddaughter and I prepared, cooked and shared ""Spectacular Berry Pancakes."" Yummy! What a treat.Strawberry shares great recipes that are fun to make, and fun to eat; from breakfast right through the day. She gives cooking tips, rules of safety and even a few stories are tucked into this wonderful book. A little added plus is a set of measuring spoons to use. Nice touch.Colorful, useful, kid and parent friendly, this is a wonderful book for young and old.A fun read, along with a super learning and sharing experience. Recommended.Shirley JohnsonSenior ReviewerMidWest Book Review"
5,INSTANT HIT!,"Very cute and sturdy cookbook. My daughter (and sons) love to look through this cookbook and decide what they'd like to make next. They've always liked to help me cook, but it's nice to have a kid-friendly book that appeals especially to them.Recipes are easy and tasty. There's a good variety of recipes as well, from snacks to salads to, of course, desserts.Great buy for the money."
5,Great first cookbook for a child,"My 5-year-old daughter picked this up at a Scholastic warehouse event. She loves it! She loves to look through the pictures and try to figure out the ingredients and directions (without being able to read yet).It has a variety of recipes from breakfast items to lunch/dinner, snacks, and drinks and desserts. There is a glossary of cooking terms in the back and it has a sturdy lay-flat binding and heavy duty wipeable cover.We have made a number of the items (very easy) and it had given me the opportunity to introduce basic cooking techniques to her. She loves that she has her own set of measuring spoons (pink no less).The recipes and ingredients are simple but tasty and definitely geared to appeal to children and their attention span."
2,Cute but the recipes are lacking,"I was so excited for our excursion into the recipes but after the brownies I'm pretty freaked out. The brownies looked wrong as batter, but I went ahead and put them in the oven. They came out like chocolate charcoal. I triple checked the ingredients before I put them in so there is a typo somewhere.We also are in the middle of a batch of the candy cane cookies. I'm not sure how they'll turn out, but the dough is really difficult for little hands to work with. Very loose, so it cracks and breaks when you try to roll it into a candy cane. I've had to assembly line it and do most of the work just to get them off of their boards and onto the cookie sheet.So, besides the cute stories and great layout I'm pretty unhappy. A lot of hype for a lot of nothing. I'm going to do more internet research to see if anyone else has found typos in the recipes."
5,Mental Aikido for Solution-Oriented People,"Lucy Gill's realistic strategies add a significant number of new tools to the communication toolkit. The problem-solutions presentation is like mental aikido: you can see how to use the situation to help correct the situation.I'm a project management consultant and coach for Internet startups. My clients can usually handle the technical problems; it's the people that challenge them, especially in hectic ""instant company, instant culture"" environments.Lucy Gill's examples really tap an individual's ""response-ability"" to change their role in a situation and create solutions. I give my clients a copy of the book to reinforce our discussions - so they can take with them answers to the question ""What do I say when I get back to my office?"""
1,Incredibly bad installation program,"I spent 3 days trying to get this installed. I think the complication was that I had Norton Systemworks 2005 and wanted to add the NAV 2006 on top of it. Well I finally got it done, but not until I'd restored my system to a backup from before I'd installed NSW 2005. At that point I had NSW 2003 installed. I had to manually uninstall that and remove tons of entries from the registry. Norton's automated uninstall failed over and over so I gave up on that and did it by hand. Then I installed NSW 2005 with NAV. When I went to install NAV 2006 it was unable to uninstall the old version. So I had to restore the system again. This time I installed NSW 2005 without NAV. I was then able to install NAV 2006. It is working now. It just shouldn't be this difficult!"
1,Customer Service is an Oxymoron,"Bought the 3pack for home use. Installed it on two pc's and then had defective a defective new pc that it was installed on and removed. NOW, it won't let me activate on the new computer - their system is flawed!!!! They want me to mail in original invoice, unlock code and disk and THEN they'll see what they want to do. This will all take at least 2 to 3 weeks, in the meantime there is no protection on this computer. HAAAAA!They really need to have a specific code for each activation so that it updates to the active computer it is being used on - they really could figure this out. They're taking the easy way out and getting more $$$ in the process.This combined with all other slow down issues, I'm switching to ZONE Suite, as I've used Zone Alarm for years and it is great.Best of luck."
2,"Program works fine, if you can get it installed","This program works after it's installed, but the installation process is unbelievably flawed. If you have a version of Norton on your computer already, this may cause all kinds of problems with the new installation. Not only did I have to uninstall all versions (after Norton lets you install the new one), but I had to make a bunch of changes to Windows, also.On top of that, while you're struggling to install (I got it on to one computer easily, a second with some difficulty, and the third... well, it's been several days of struggle), Norton counts down the number of days in the subscription. So if you install on one computer today, and another two months later, then your subscription on all your machines still expires a year from now.I don't see how Symantec can put out a program that doesn't allow you to upgrade easily... after all these years, they can't fix this major bug? That's just pathetic."
2,Very hard to install,"It took about 15 hours per machine over a week period go get Norton AntiVirus to install and activate. Had to send a lot of emails to Symantec Tech Support. Most responses did not work, and required one to almost be a super administrator to understand what all had to be done, such as registry edits, customizing startup with msconfg, and understanding directions that did now work as Symantec said they would. Then after 4 days, one of the AntiVirus installations stopped working, requiring another 8 hours to re and re and re-install.After installed, it worked. An incredible time consuming product to install."
1,Nothing but Install Problems,"Norton Antivirus is a good protection program when it installs properly...which is seldom.I have spent a week reinstalling Norton Antivirus 2006, finding new tech documents, running programs that uninstall all of my Symantec products. Still Norton Antivirus will not update with Live Update. I waited for a week for my first response from tech support, now I am waiting for my next tech support.When I installed the second license 51 days after I installed the firs, I only received 314 days of subscription. My next subscription expires in 6 months, so I guess I will only get 4 months extension on that subscription. Buyer BEWARE!"
1,Installation Issues,This program is causing many people difficulties. I had to make two seperate calls to customer service.
3,"always read the ""requirements""","If you're one of those rare folks running a less commonly used version of Windows these days, be aware this product is for ""Windows XP Home / XP Pro / 2000 Pro ONLY""."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,Extremely difficult to unistall. Endless loop. Do NOT buy this product or if you do then be prepared for an exremely fustrating experience. I will never use NAV again.
4,Its a nice Anti virus program,I have used norton for a while and i have notice that it runs heavy on RAM side and even the lastest one norton360 is still heavy on memory but if you want a AV software that you don't want to configure to much and would work with first install for you norton is the best for you.
1,Norton,"I have 3 computers with different expiration dates for the installed Norton anti-virus programs. I purchased the 3-pack and installed it into the computers as the old subscriptions expired. I then found out that the clock for the 3 units started when the program was installed into the first computer. When I contacted Norton, they acknowledged that it was designed that way and gave me a code to enter into the three computers in order to increase their protection to a full. When the code was entered into the first computer the clock increased to 1 year in that computer. Norton would not allow the code to be entered into the other 2 computers. I will never purchase another Norton product."
3,Norton AntiVirus 2006 review,"Previously had NAV 2004 installed (Windows XP pro). Installation took several steps (and time) ... installation of data off of the CD, access the NAV website for latested update, configuration and finally a full scan of the system.In addition there were several ""required"" reboots (which also slowed down the installation).Finally after the installation was completed, I ran a ""full scan"" of my system. I didn't time the run, but overall it seems that it takes longer to do a ""full scan"" with NAV 2006 that with NAV 2004.Another change from NAV 2006 to 2004 is that NAV 2006 now installs a large tab in the toolbar ... a bit irratating."
3,A usage guide,"Not an editorial guide, but an alphabetical usage guide of short entries, specifically British, with spellings and names, and the like."
3,Too Small of a book...,The book stands no more than 6inches in height and the binding is overly tight...I haven't decided whether I'm returning it or not yet--I'll use it for a few more days as I write my novel and make my decision then.It was probably my fault for not having read the dimensions of the book in the first place...I hope this review is helpful to you.
4,where are these guys?,"Picked this up upon recommendation of a Boston area music reviewer. Blew my mind. Wish they were still playing live shows. I definitely don't think this is the same Toetag I found on the internet. If you're in the mood for heavy drumming, pseudo-politcal lyrics and an unusual voice on leads then Righteous is for you. Would love to know the story behind ""Chinese Mafia Shot my Car""."
4,knee pads are great.,The Pro tec knee pads are great! They are the best I've used yet. They slide nice on the concrete transitions in the skate park.
3,Not fond of the return policy,The product did not meet the needs based on fit.If you need to return the product do no expect to receive your full purchase price back.
5,las mejores,estas rodilleras son muy muy muy buenas comodas no pesan y se ajustan muy bien a la rodilla .... el vendedor muy cumplido y confiable recomendado
3,incorrect information,"Im not a seasoned amazon shopper but I do check the information and the decriptions, when they suggest a product and something to go with it you would think the two items would match. Not the case. I ordered a driving light kit with the stone covers to go with them. I received the light kitHELLA 008283811 FF50 Series 12V/55W Halogen Driving Lamp Kitand one cover. no where did it say that i needed to order a extra cover to go with the second light."
3,The only option,"Hella knows this is the only real option to protect the FF50 light. And as with most Hella products, it is of excellent quality and durable. Still, you have to hate paying so much for an item that probably cost $1 to make. Major ripoff and I've downgraded it for that."
5,awesome extenders,"really great extender with the spring, very flexible,my husband can even put these on with his large fingers, bought other plastic collar extenders before and these are by far superior"
3,Great Concept,"While a great concept for extending the collar on a shirt, these just aren't quite stretchy enough to provide a half an inch...maybe a quarter of an inch."
2,collar button extender,"It could use a little longer piece of elastic as collar button holes are really small and this extender is difficult to attach.,"
5,did the trick,I bought this item for my 91 year old father who has gained some weight recently. I remember these used to be available in every barbershop and mens store. It's good to know you can still buy these at a reasonable price!
3,Don't try unless you've read the rest,"I picked up this book used due to the praise for the other books in the series. I gave up about a third of the way through because so much of it involved people within the Scottish police community whom I didn't know and especially the politics involved in the bureaucracy. The mystery Bob Skinner is solving is intriguing but too little of the book is about that. In addition, much is about the various agencies of police in three different locales (plus the FBI) fighting over jurisdiction. That has been done to death in every police procedural and is a bit old by this time. Also, the non-American English put into Americans' mouths grates after a while. If a non-American is attempting to use slang, please get it right. If you know all the characters from the previous 11 novels, you might like it better than I did."
5,Fully worthy of Coltrane and ALS,Wow. This thing is a wonder. Great performance by four very fine musicians; pristine audio; and a warm and immediate video that--and I'm sorry for this--makes you feel like you're right there. Loaded with really enjoyable extras. You can't go wrong with this.This is the first time in a long time that a DVD makes me want to actually own a big HDTV and some high-end audio gear.
1,A Love Supreme or a Disappointment Supreme,"I love Branford Marsalis' music. I've been following his stuff for 20 years. When I saw this new DVD a couple months ago, I thought 'what a find'! Unfortunately, it's a bust. It sounds like four guys playing, but none is really listening to any of the others. I'd save my money and pass on this one if I had it to do over."
5,Great source for biographical info,"This is another volume culled from the 10-volume MOUNTAIN MEN AND THE FUR TRADE OF THE FAR WEST by LeRoy R. Hafen. The men chosen for inclusion here were all associated with the fur trade in the Upper Missouri region. Some of the trappers and traders dealt with are John F.A. Sanford, Charles Larpenteur, Alexander Culbertson, William Laidlaw, and J.B. Moncravie. Personalities run the gamut from honorable and intelligent (Moncravie and Kenneth McKenzie, for example) to brave and able (just about everybody). The biographies are encyclopedic: all known pertinent facts are given, but not expanded on. I wish for this volume Hafen had perhaps broadened the category for inclusion a bit, because the book is about half the length of companion volumes; most of the biographies are only a few pages long. Other than that, it's an excellent source for biographical information on important figures of the Upper Missouri trade."
3,Eighteen short biographies,"This edition is a good hundred pages shorter than some of the other in the series. The biographical sketches are up to standard, but the map provided is the usual pale hard to see one. Magnifying glass required!! But text good."
5,This book changed my life!,"This book changed the life of an unhappy, unpopular middle school student. I loved it so much that I did something I never had done before and never did again -- I kept it and never returned it to my middle school's library. I still carry guilt over this -- not so much for the apparent theft, but because I deprived other students of having this resource.I still have this book and love it. It helped me love life and have a reasonably successful high school career, and an even better time in college and then law school."
3,functional but....,"This product is functional but there are certain deficiencies that potential buyers should know. 1) When you are recording a show, you may only see a small window of the show as the recording is going on if the low resolution mode is selected, or you may see a blank screen when high resolution mode is selected. 2) When you are not recording, the user interface as displayed on your TV would not allow you to view the video input. The lack of this feature results in the inability to view in advance the channel what you are recording or to select the channels you want to record."
2,Saving home movies,SanDisk definitely had the right idea with this straight to media memory recorder. Unfortunately this is either an early model or they missed the boat.The remote is hit or miss and selects twice per click most of the time. Starting the recording works well but you cannot stop it. So unless you have a small memory card and want to take everything until full (which is when it will stop recording automatically) then this is not the unit for you.I hope SanDisk has an upgraded model because this would be great if it could be controlled like a video recorder should be.The price was right and it was worth a try but this model is not worth even the cheap price.
3,"""bad atom"" errors during playback on PCs","I'm using a V-Mate with the vmate_02.07.ww.b8.fpk firmware installed. It usually records fine in 640x480 30fps ""PC"" mode, but with some source video, the recorded MP4 fails to play either in QuickTime or on Windows Media Player. QuickTime will report either a ""bad public atom"" or ""bad movie atom."" Nero ShowTime and ArcSoft's video players will play part of the file before stopping with an error. Has anyone else encountered this, and is there a workaround? So much for digitizing all of my old home movies in time for Christmas. Most recordings are just fine, it's just a few that are giving me trouble."
2,Extremely Limited,"Don't expect too much from this device. The output is very grainy. If recording from VHS the picture will be blocky because it will not deinterlace the picture. Also, I had a lot of issues with the remote. It is very slow to respond and sometimes it took several key presses to work."
1,SanDisk SDMV1-R V-Mate-poor response between remote and unit,"Unfortunately, after I hooked up the SanDisk SDMV1-R V-Mate, when I tried to set up the V-Mate, the response between the remote and the V-Mate was very poor. I was not able to complete the setup. However, the company that sold the SanDisk V-Mate through Amazon.Com, Adorama Camera, has excellent customer service, and they allowed me to return the opened V-Mate because it was not really operable. I would not purchase the SanDisk V-Mate again; however, I would purchase from Adorama Camera again with confidence."
2,SanDisk V-Mate,Great idea but picture resembles watching old VHS tapes!!!! There is also no caption option. Hope they are working on a better version.
3,"OK, but not the greatest","Easy to use, allows you to watch the playback on your TV or computer, resolution is not that good and playback is jerky even at highest level of recording."
3,SanDisk V-Mate Video Memory Card Recorder brief review,"Works OK 640X480 Max resolution, is temperamental, needs periodic reboots.Use class 4 or better media for decent playback."
3,Just bought this as a vcr for my SD TV and PSP,"I just bought the v-mate to use as a standard def DVR. At first I was not impressed with anything recorded at 640x480, only 320x240. But after updating the firmware, The v-mate worked a lot better.Now this is not H264. And the quality is not perfect at the highest quality on my TV. If you have a lot of movement, there will be a few artifacts. But when I place the videos on my PSP, they work great. And it's acceptable over a VCR. I would give this a 3.5 out of 5 stars."
3,Good feature/value combination,"The capability of this device is good when it is in the $25 price range. I didn't find any other products that had this ability (analog video input to digital flash media output without a computer) anywhere near this price point. You should know that current time/date is not saved when power is removed and it will not function until the clock/date is reset via the on screen controls. Scheduled recording times are retained. It isn't described in the user guide, but to record via the schedule, you need to navigate to the Recording window as if to manually record and then leave the unit powered on. It will record on the schedule(s) you've entered. Don't expect much out of the ability to use IR to control another device and you won't be disappointed."
1,Would like to return but supplier will not answer,Would like to return but supplier will not answer and therefore will not supply a return authorization or is delaying to get out of the return allowable time.
1,A Great Idea - A Very Inferior Product,"What could be more simple? A VCR equivalent that records to SD cards instead of VHS tape. Unfortunately, this product lives up to what can be expected from most everything made in China. Installation was easy, but set-up was impossible because the remote control behaved erratically controlling the TV set-up screens. None of the IR Emitter codes worked reliably turning the my satellite receiver on and off. After struggling with it for about an hour, I put everything back in the blister-pak and shipped it back to the mail-order place I ordered it from. A huge disappointment from the largest manufacturer, Sandisk, of memory cards. I conclude this product was designed, developed, and manufactured in China, and marketed under Sandisk's label. Don't waste your time and money on this device."
1,Pretty worthless,I'm afraid this book is pretty useless as far as factual information goes. Few texts are properly cited and John Paul I is quoted as saying all sorts of things--ie condemning Moses--which it's pretty hard to credit. Many of his public speeches are available and they don't support the contentions made. Both David Yallop's and John Cornwell's books cover the same material and are vastly better; though they write from very different perspectives.
2,I'm shocked that people give this crazy book 5 stars,"I'd give it one star if it wasn't for the fact that I like JPI and value whatever real info I might have found here. Unfortunately, you can't tell what is real and what isn't. This is apparently a self-published rant that is poorly researched, horribly written, and excruciatingly edited. And I am a faithful, liberal daughter of the church. I would like nothing more than a great scholarly biography of JPI. I read Yallop's ""In God's Name"" and wanted to learn more about JPI's life, teachings and his suspicious death. You certainly can find good info in Gregoire's book, but you can't trust it, which is too bad. This is no better than a lot of those tantrum websites you can find all day long for free, only without the animated graphics.NOTE: It's important to note that I read the ""black cover"" edition, and have not read the newly revised 2006 edition (white cover). I intend to do so."
5,Expousure!,"Ah, being exposed. I just love to watch them squirm. Is the Vatican a country? If not then why do they have their own currency? Questions a dictator never wants to have to answer. I believe by having this question of currency answered we can begin to tax the catholic church. Do I hear deficite reduction? This will also allow them to legally endorse a candidate for public office. Religious institutions are exempt from paying taxes. This book exposes the Vatican for what it is, a nation state."
3,Great book - Terrible Grammar and Sentence Structure,"This book desperately needs a proofreader.Although the narrative is very interesting, sentences are disjointed, or are incomplete, and it's a CHORE to read through it. Many of the illustrations are dark and/or grainy -- was this a paste-up job in a .jpeg world?A revision would be a great idea."
2,Not up to par,"I love Mil Millington's website and enjoyed his first book, but this book was very disappointing. While Millington's first book was witty with a fun story line and humorous insight that kept you reading until the end, this book droned on and on; I wound up skipping over more than half of the book. Yes, the first chapter was funny, but after that it was the same comments and musings over and over and the story took forever to get anywhere; in short, a real snoozer.I am a huge fan of British TV and books, so this is not a reflection of my appreciation of British humor, it just was not a good book. If you really want to laugh, read Sean Condon (an Australian). His books are hysterical, especially ""My Dam Life""."
5,"Boy meets girl, then meets another girl...","Then he falls off a bike, then he loses both girls. Well, a whole bunch of other stuff happens as well and it is all VERY funny. Every man who is in a relationship needs to read this book. Oh, and God narrates."
2,Disappointed!! ..Again.,"Mr. Millington is a hoot. His short jags on his own foibles and on life with his German girlfriend, Margret, and their 2 kids are some of the funniest humor pieces I've read in the last few years. Unfortunately, all these appear on his blog, http://www.milmillington.com/, ""Things my girlfriend and I have Argued About"" (also the name of his first novel). I read his first novel in June '04 and was disappointed. I just finished this, his second novel, and was disappointed. Again. While there are flashes of his blog's off-the-deep-end screeches, both novels tend toward being screeds. He is obviously a talent worth paying attention to. It just seems the novel form constricts him. Perhaps, the way to go would be a collection of short stories. Mr. Millington's novel-writing is enjoyable, a lion in a circus. I prefer the excitement of the jungle, where he'd be closer to his nature. Read some of his blog postings to see what could have been...and maybe will be in his next book."
5,A book everyone should read,"This book was Excellent. Words can not explain how this book has changed my life. I think every individual should read this book before entering into a serious relationship. In fact, I believe all kids should have to read this book before seventh grade. This books explains a lot more the sex education especially the emotional side of sex and relationships"
2,Needs Revision,"The author made the mistake of having a non-native English speaker translate his work. The result -- stilted constructions, misuse of various words -- detracts from his message. At times the errors are almost comical, and this is not supposed to be a comic novel."
1,Youth NOT in Sexual Ecstasy,"I mistakingly thought this novel would actually portray youth (college-age persons) in sexual ecstasy. There was ZERO sexual ecstasy in this book! Carlos Sanchez should consider renaming this ""Youth NOT in Sexual Ecstasy""...boorriinngg!"
4,leather vest,"This is a very nice vest for the price, I put my own eagle on the back because the eagle that comes with it is smaller."
4,"Pretty good, but lacked a little something.","In 177A.D. the Roman conquest of Britain is being thwarted by guerrillas in the north.Quintus Dias is the only survivor of a raid on a frontier fortress . He joins with the forces of General Virilus and the 9th Legion. Their mission is to eradicate the Pict resistance. Quintus face terrible odds as he tries to rescue his General and regain the honor of the Legion.This movie is very entertaining. It's got good acting, cinematography, and a fairly solid story line. It lacks a little bit in the way of character development, but it delivers a good experience nonetheless. I wasn't disappointed by this movie. It's a good addition to anyone's collection."
2,Just not my movie,Couldn't get into this movie at all. Maybe another day I will try again. I typically love these types of movies I just can't put my finger on what was missing
4,msmaddy52,"I really enjoyed this movie, I think a sequel should be made on Quintas and Adrianne. I would love to see a follow up movie!"
3,Here's another one.,"Movies like this are a little annoying for their silly assumptions, but this one was done OK and moves along at a decent pace."
2,Low Budget film with some good and a portion of bad,"You have a film here with some B list actors and a C list script. The costumes are decent and the actors are good enough but with a script with that's predictable, well worn plot twists and an unrealistic story you can only expect so much. The fights scenes are well executed but the C.G.I. blood splatter is unneeded and distracting besides being unrealistic. It's a good 100 min distraction if you have Amazon prime. It sucks if you have to pay for it."
4,centurion,This is a good story with good actors and characters. The one drawback for me was that it reminded me of good books that needed better editors.
3,Centurion,Acting wasn't very good... Boring. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. Real bloody and loaded with violence. Not very good
1,Centurian,"This is not a Roman Epic movie. Very unrealistic and depressing. The fact that one 110 lb. woman can completely destroy a legion of Romans is rediculous. I enjoy movies set in this time period, but have some sense of reality. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. And if you get the digital copy it's impossible to down load. DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE."
1,pass,"i tried to get thru this movie but it was slow in every-way. zzzzz The acting was, well, not really there. I just think the story line was lacking so the actors did not have a chance. I like this type of movie, IE 300 - but this ones lacking"
2,Disappointing - too much violence and too little history,"I love history movies, particular about the ancient world, so I wanted to see this movie - alas, it was first of all a war movie that had little dept and instead far, far more gory violence than I care for. While there is a historic background to the story, it really only provides that: a background. The story is shallow and predictable and seems to serve only to justify as much violence as possible. This movie would not appeal to someone who is actually interested in history as the time period serves only as a backdrop - the very same story could have been framed in any other time without needing to go any more indept in the details of the particular historic period. Not recommended for anyone - there is little if anything to learn, not about history, not about emotion, intellect, or spirituality. Instead, once more the viewer is inundated with too many images of violence that are already over abundant in our world today."
4,Good movie!,The good guys always get the shaft by the government! Tha's the way it has been and the way it will be for ever!
3,Centurian,"This is a movie that deserved better ratings than it got. For some the Roman Army in Britain might be a boring subject, but it's an interesting take on the fate of the Ninth Hispana. Read ""Eagle of the Ninth"" to get a feel for what the story is about"
3,So the Romans are the good guys? Confusing..,"Good action scenes, cinematography, etc. but the tone of this movie is strange -- like we are supposed to like or admire the Romans, though they are the invaders. (I guess it's hard to identify with the protagonist if he's a creep)...Maybe the Romans would have found the Picts to be fairly likeable if they weren't trying to kill them and take their land. You never know...........A better movie concerning the same subject is the Eagle -- which doesn't seem as forced as this film..."
4,Epic battles and beautiful women,"I watched this film for two reasons:1) Magnet distribution (they rarely let me down)2) Neil is directing it (I loved Descent)I wasn't disappointed; the fight choreography is dense and varied, the score is authentic and alive. As for the tacked on romance I rather enjoyed that aspect; even though it's so convientient, it allowed for some sort of ""feel good"" ending.Also I found myself rooting for the bad guys, which I think is a credit to the director and the actors. I mean the Romans were invading, raping, stealing, etc and still I was rooting for Fassbender and his team during the course of the movie (even after finding out about Etains situation).Highly recommended for it's great acting, fighting sequences, and sweeping landscapes."
4,Great Battle scenes,"Thought the battle scenes were as realistic as I have ever seen. Good movie, well worth the time to watch"
3,Need a quick fix for an action film?,"If you're a guy and you just need a quick fix for an action flick, then here ya go. If you are looking for a good film, keep scrolling through. For guys not wanting or expecting much, this one is perfect."
1,Don't waste an hour of life on this,"The story was predictable and simple. It could have been written by middle school kids. Pointless is the best single word for this waste of film. Average acting and above average blood splatter are the highest and best praise possible for this slasher want-to-be. Really, don't waste a moment of life on this. Reruns of the A Team are better than this useless dribble."
3,Centurion,"I'm surprised that director Neil Marshall who hails from Newcastle upon Tyne, through which Hadrian's Wall ran, should get the movie's historical facts so wrong. Tha Gaelic spoken in the film is Irish which was never a language of the Brythonic Celtic tribes of AD 117. The Picts were just one of many ancient British tribes around then and those well south of what is now Highland Scotland spoke a language similar to ancient Welsh. The film is, therefore, historically inept. Reading some of reviews here suggests the writers think thay have learned some history. Well I'm sorry but it's tosh! Visually and sonically the film has many good points but it doesn't overcome my concerns."
2,More misinformation,"Centurion passes on the old myth of the disappearance of the 9th legion after it marched north into Scotland.In fact there are records of the 9th after the period of the movie. It apparently was stationed on the Rhine where it was probably lost due to attrition. The inspiration for the movie is an old children's book. The myth of the 9th legion is popular in England and Scotland for obvious reasons. And the fearsome female Pict warrior seems more based more on anime films than any historic precedent. The acting was good, but I never believed this script for a minute. If I wanted to see false British history, I'd watch a King Arthur film."
2,A huge disapointment!,"Neil made one of my all time favorite films, The Descent. Centurion was a complete disappointment. Lackluster acting and story. Some pretty good action, but ruined by the very ""video looking"" quality and the lack of giving a damn about any of these characters!"
3,Fall of the Roman Empire... these soldiers really can't fight,"Two thousand years ago, northern Britain's native people, the Picts, rallied against the Romans. In the northernmost outpost, a small garrison was massacred, except for second-in-command Quintus Dias (Michael Fassbender). He is rescued by the Roman's Ninth Legion, commanded by popular General Virilus.And then the Picts take on the Ninth Legion.So this is a sword. spear, and archery intensive, blood spattering (as in the300), chase, get caught, and escape type movie.The Romans, supposedly one of the most sophisticated and well-trained armies of the world, don't fare very well. And why does escape seem to involve tramping over snow-covered mountain ridges, sensuThe Lord of the Rings? Aren't there better ways to escape detection and get from point A to point B?There were just enough problems like this that made the plot irritating. Be warned."
3,Historically dubious but moderately entertaining,"Acceptable adventure film of the sword and sandals genre, set in Roman Britain, has some Roman soldiers, survivors from a massacre against the bloody Pict tribes, fleeing behind enemy lines. Historically dubious (the ragtag platoon includes, seemingly for PC reasons and ludicrously from a historical point of view, a black roman soldier), this violent and bloody, muscular and masculine film is, for all its flaws, certainly entertaining. I found this better and more enjoyable than the recent, similarly themed Eagle of the Ninth. The pristine, misty Scottish outdoors where this movie was filmed certainly helps. Acting is not the main point of this movie, as the actors have to put up with some terse, rough lines. Michael Fassbender, who was fine in the more recent X-Men film, fails to make much of an impression here as the top Roman soldier here, but Ukrainian model Olga Kurylenko, is surprisingly OK as the top warrioress of the Picts."
2,Not well done,"A bit too prefabricated and predictable. A recycled and hackneyed story.Lacks any charm as a film, watching feels like a drudgery.The real story, without much embellishment would be more refreshing."
3,Decend,"As with a lot of these types of movies they are written as 21st century people with 21st century values cast back into roman times. That's ok for this movie. Its interested and has a reasonable plot. If you are looking for Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire, this isn't it."
3,Gory good story,"Lately there have been a lot of movies about the Roman Empire's reach into the British Isles. There was the King Arthur retelling with Clive Owen and Keira Knightley. And soon after that was Colin Firth in the Last Legion. Now we have Centurion, about a group of surviving roman centurions who struggle to reach friendly ground after their legion is destroyed by Picts. Combining great scenery, bloody violence, raucous humor with betrayals and backstabbing, this movie shows life in the Roman Empire as brutal and bloody. And yes, we have warrior babes, more than in previous sword-fighting movies. The soundtrack was a disappointment; for a movie with scenery and cinematography like LOTR, the background music was totally forgettable. Outside of that, this was an above-average action flick."
3,It was okay,It started off pretty good but it could've had a better ending - like a lot of movies these days.
1,centurion Ble-ray DVD,Does not play without internet--it will not play without it. I don't connect my blu-ray to internet and don't plan to in the future-this should have been posted before purchase.
3,"All style, no substance",Lots of great fighting scenes. But nothing really pulled me in to the story. ZZZZzzzzzzzzz.
2,Left me empty,For me to like a movie it has to have either a character I can relate to or at least someone I can cheer for. This movie had neither. No good guys in this movie. Just lots of blood and body parts.
3,Not bad.,"I remember before this movie came out, the previews were everywhere. It is not the epic struggle that the preview suggested, but it is not a bad movie either. The acting was uneven but overall pretty decent. No big-name stars. I like that. The actor doesn't upstage the character."
4,Decent Theory of a historical event.,"Considering that the Story of the 9th Legion is really Unknown apart from the point of disappearance, this was a very entertaning yarn of the possibilities. I enjoy these movies as pure entertainment."
1,Don't waste your money,"Bad acting on top of an even worse script was painful enough. Add in the utterly gratuitous violence and some of the worst computer-generated special effects-- seriously, I haven't seen such tacky blood-gushing scenes since the Wild Bunch made in since the 1960s-- and you have the makings of a truly terrible film. The Eagle was a decent enough film and if you were hoping for an inspired story of the Ninth Legion you won't find it here. So the Scottish scenery was beautiful ... in the viewer's imagination it was left scarred and worse for the wear by this toothache of a film."
1,Miss leading,"The picture of the ""Centurion"" shows BlueRay + Digital Copy but the one I received is only available in Blueray. Please take off this picture if you want to sell this product in Blueray format only."
2,UK Film Commission PC yawn fest,"When I saw the UK Film Commission scroll by on opening credits I feared I was in for a multicultural debacle like the BBC Robin Hood series and I was unfortunately not mistaken. Apart from the silly casting theres really not much character to the film to make it exciting. The early battle scenes and the scenery are enjoyable but overall Id say this film is a $1 red box rental at best. If you want a mindless fun period movie in recent releases Id say Outlander is a better bet. Its silly but more enjoyable to watch than Centurion. My buddies warned me Centurion was a one buck movie, next time I'll listen."
4,Shades of Roman Britain,"Centurion is an interesting film about Roman Times in Britain. Like the U S Cavalry in the West with the Native Americans, the Romans had to deal with people they thought very little of, often in a brutal manner. Perhaps the film could have been edited better, as sometimes there seemed t be gaps in the narrative. But all in all, a rousing sometimes terrifying look at ambition and bloody mindedness in ancient Britain.Conveniently bought from Amazon which seems to have titles hard to find."
4,"If You Liked Spartacus: Blood And Sand, You Should Enjoy This","Be it ever so humble, there's no place like Rome and all these Romans want to do is make it home but with an expert tracker, who's after their heads and mile after mile of being hunted on foot, these poor guys don't look like they have much of a chance.Or do they...Not a bad effort if you can take it on a pure guts and glory survival quest.I liked it, it held my interest."
3,a bloody tale,"centurion is an action movie..very graphic,bloody battle scenes..I dont know if it is based on actual history but it says it is onthe sleeve..olga kurylenco stands out as the female lead.michael fassbender[dont know him??]is quite good as the roman centurion..if you like gladiator movies,you will like this"
4,nice movie,Lots of blood and gore but comes with a story! A movie with a story seems to be a rare find. I liked this movie when I rented it from Netflix. I will end up buying it later. The acting was not bad and the country side was breath taking!
4,Entertaining historical fiction,"Interesting drama about a history with very little data, lots of imagination and action, great filming in Northern Scotland. Worth viewing, but lots of graphic violence, blood and gore."
4,Really good.,"This is a beautifully shot movie. It is tight, cohesive with a ton of action and written well. A very pleasant surprise."
5,a must for all circus model builders,"Being an over 30 year member of the Circus Model Builders and known for the circus truck models I have built, this book has a lot of picture history. I remember seeing the truck that is on the cover when I was a child and it brings back memories. I have never seen any of the photos in this book before and many of the over land trucks I have seen in person. This book is a must for all people interested in the circus or the many types of trucks circuses used."
4,"My mom was right, they did grow up in a different world.","My mom gave me this book and told me to read it and find out what it was like when she was growing up, and I have to admit I learned a ton about why she and dad are the way they are; and I laughed myself silly doing it. It's the story of a young family just moved into a new suburb in a small town in Oregon, and how they cope with all the universal social climbing pitfalls of the early 50's. Told from the perspective of their young daughter it covers all the excitment, fears, and confusion of growing up then, in a time with no TV, video games, computers, or other things my generation takes for granted, but they sure seemed to have a lot more fun, and way more laughter, than I did when I was that age. A must read for anyone who's parents, or grandparents, grew up right after World War 2. You'll be sharing funny memories with them for a long time after you've finished this wonderful book."
3,"Interesting, but not entirely accurate","As a volunteer bear educator, who presents bear programs to adults and children, I was somewhat disappointed in this book, which has some glaring errors in the information presented."
5,Mighty Boosh Rule!,"I own all 3 seasons Region 1 of Mighty Boosh, the Mighty Boosh Live dvd and the Region 1 Series 1,2,3 Collector dvd set. I watch them repeatedly and continue to pick things up every time. When I'm bored, feeling down, or just want an escape and to laugh a bit I can always count on the Boosh! These guys are brilliantly entertaining!"
5,Boosh!,"Anyone who enjoys off the wall humor, this series if for you. Slightly reminiscent of Monty Python, though new millenium in it's approach, Vince Noir and Howard Moon will keep you laughing. It can be a little bawdy at times, but never mean or too over the top. It's silly, whacky and definitely amusing. It is absolutely British, more outfront than American humor and keeps me laughing from start to finish. The characters are wonderful and so is the music which is mainly written by Julian Barrat who plays Howard Moon. Join the Boosh cult today!"
5,The Best X-Men game on Game Gear,"This is the Best X-Men game on Game Gear, period. It is also a Game Gear EXCLUSIVE!"
5,So if you can't become a rock star...,"Robert Draper's Rolling Stone Magazine: The Uncensored Story is a stunning testament to the magazine which helped herald in an era, and has been here ever since. This book isn't about the artists that were covered; instead it's more about the staff, the writers, th editors, and especially founder Jann Wenner, almost biographically so.Now out of the 60's came many things good and bad but in the late 60's Rolling Stone the magazine was formed. However it's never that simple and Draper conveys that well. With inside information due to hundreds of interviews and just some good research he pieces together what life was like behind the cover.My only fault is that I wish this book could have been written in 2004 instead of 1990 so that I could learn about recent events. Overall this is a great book and I highly recommend it for musicians, journalists, and any Rolling Stone magazine avid fans out there."
4,Library copy.,"I really wish someone would have put ""library copy"" in the description somewhere. ""Used-good"" does not imply that ""Such-and-such Library"" will be stamped all over the sides and there will be a rough cover.Other than that, the shipping was quick and the book seems to be in decent condition. I believe I scored a first-edition print too."
1,Outdated Version- Buy the new one instead,"At one time, this was the bible for governmental accounting. That is no longer true. Using this edition will only cause confusion. In the rapidly changing world of governmental accounting, this book is outdated. Using it as a guide, may cause governmental agencies to get a qualified opinion."
5,Wow! This story will grab your attention and your heart.,"Whether you are spiritual or religious (they are NOT the same thing) this book will speak to you. In times where many don't know their neighbor or where many humans view others who are different with suspicion --this book reminds us of what is important.This autobiographical account is engaging and hard to put down. The stories and struggles of the growth of a ministry/church called ""Graffiti"" is set in a Lower East Side neighborhood in New York. It is poignant and speaks about the joys, heartaches, and relationships in day-to-day life.Given the 9/11/01 events this book is well timed to remind us to get back to basics.....love, trust, kindness and honesty cross all barriers. We just need to remember...........Buy it and share it...."
3,A bit small,The earrings are as pictured but the phantom mask is really a bit small. I ordered this for my wife and I suppose a clue might have been the hook that goes in the ear and its size to that but I didn't pick up on it. They are okay just too small.
1,a novel huh?,"This is just about the worst piece of crap I've ever read. Sometimes I really wondered how anyone can lable Edna O'Brien a writer. Nothing interesting happens, the charachters are the most non-colourful (can you use that word?) I've ever read about and the circumstances are just unbelievable. A 21 year old girl who knows nothing about nothing. Just cries all the time, thinks she is fat, and dreams about the perfect man (who she by the way thinks only exists in movies and such). On top of all this it's just so badly written. It's like "" on the evening we talked about going to a party. Then we went to bed and slept. When we woke up we put on make-up and went to that party..."" I mean... it's not like very good reading. I don't recommend it."
5,Where are they now,"When I heard the first recording album I loved it. I know they came out in 1996, I am wishing they get back together now because latin musicians are coming out more and more. Their voices are so soulful, in addition their beautiful faces. I think they were short changed and should get another chance. I am a great fan of theirs. It is now 2005 and would loveto see a new album of them even in Spanish. I feel they can still become a great band. So keeping my fingers cross for themto get together talent like theirs never die, they just have to find it again................."
4,excellent follow-up,"No Mercy does a bang up job on their sophomore effort. This group introduced me to Latin rhythms long before Ricky Martin or Jennifer Lopez. While they are not as ""big"" in the US as they should be, this German import should convince Americans to give them a second look."
5,"No Mercy ""More""","This is an amazing Latin group from Miami that somehow fell through the cracks for most of the American audience. Just by listening, you can tell they were having a ball. The group is lively, soulful and exciting. If you can get your hands on this album and their ""No Mercy"" entry album, grab them while you can. Highly recommended."
2,Unjustified points throughout,"Dr. Marcus should stick to what he does best, lecturing. This book tries to draw connections that are rarely justified, points that he may be successful in conveying to an audience in a lecture setting, but ones that seem totally off-the-wall in a book as brief as this one. Nevertheless, certain points do seem valid and interesting."
1,"If you've read the book, don't watch the movie","I am a devout Dean Koontz fan, I bow to his decandence filled elegance. The first book I read from him was ""The Bad Place"" and I haven't looked back. This movie is a slap in the face to the man who has given so many incredible stories.I am a fan of cheesey, B-horror moves (see original ""Dawn of the Dead"", but a teenaged Corey Haim as a 40 something ex-special ops man, get real. Trust me DO NOT READ BOOK FIRST!!! If you haven't read book, you'll probably enjoy this cheesefest. I would give this movie no stars, but Amazon won't let me.Mr. Koontz, since you have more control over how you're books are translated now, I hope there is a time when you can pay correct homage to Furball."
2,When will a movie follow the book?,"Short and sweet ... Why does Hollywood think that a movie can have the title of a good book, yet not follow the story line? About the only simularity to Mr. Koontz' book is a ""smart"" Golden Retriever. We do not see the gradual awareness the ""hero"" has of the dog's intelligence, based upon the question/answer process and the Scrabble letter machine. Where does a Teen come in, in the book? It doesn't! I was really disappointed ... as I usually am with Hollywood's pictures from a book I have read."
1,Disappointed...,"I love Bassett Hounds ...and Mysteries! - I thought what better combination than to find both in one book!?! I was very disappointed...the plot was thin and the resolution was easy to figure out half way through reading it.....and, I must add, when will some authors figure out that most of us read for pleasure....we don't need the author's personal agenda that permeates a storyline and keeps popping up in the characters' comments....if we want that, we'll read non-fiction."
2,NOT SO GOOD!!!!!,"I bought this book after reading all the 5* reviews. I didn't feel like any of the characters were likable except for the Basset Hound, Cruiser. He was adorable. Beanie & Nona & all the other players in the story didn't come alive as actual people. The Lake Tahoe setting was interesting as was the back story about the Washoe Indian Tribe. In the past when I've read bad reviews of certain Authors, I felt like the Reader should just shut up. But for the price I paid for this book, I wish I would of bought another Book by Nina Wright."
3,Fair but not the best,I like all Star Trek books but this one could have used a little more excitement.
3,"Starts off badly, gets much better","The first nine chapters are clunky and a little boring-- it's all stage-setting, with lots of switching back-and-forth between the actions of one group and another, but the pacing gets much better after chapter nine. Everything after that is a good, fast-paced read. Some of the supporting characters just clutter the lanscape and slow down the plot, but overall, I recommend it."
2,I usually like Friedman's stuff...,"This book needed to be written, but I'm pretty confident it could have been written better. In a misguided attempt to repeat the first Picard/Crusher scene, we are completely deprived of the only significant epiphany/catharsis this story holds. Fans of the couple will want to read it, anyway, but it will probably leave you more than a little disappointed."
3,So So Book. Friedman's Written Better,"This wasn't one of Mike Friedman's best ones. It's an okay story that's a sorta sequal to Reunion which does have a sub plot from that novel also written by Michael Friedman which, in my opinion, is a much better book. But, if you like Michael Jan Friedman's books regardless of it's plot, then pick this one up otherwise, stick to taking it out from the library.Side Note: A lot of people assume that this was the book to relaunch TNG however you'd be assuming wrong as the relaunch begins in 2007 with JM Dillard's Resistance."
4,"It's about time, Jean-Luc!","It's been a few years since I've read a Star Trek novel. Seeing this one on Amazon and reading the reviews here persuaded me to give it a try. I've always been a fan of the Picard/Crusher storyline - albeit a frustrated fan. I really enjoyed this book. I won't give away any plot points, but the only thing I wish could have been better was the ending. It didn't seem to ring true, but perhaps it was written the way it was to set up the final ""scene"". I am very much looking forward to the next book this year!"
2,Not particularly interesting despite characters I liked........,"I went in to this book fully expecting to like it despite some of the negative reviews I had read about them because I'm a big fan of Picard and Crusher as characters, and I've enjoyed their friendship over the years as it's been a welcome outlet for someone as disciplined and private as Picard. Still, even though that was the main part of the story, I felt that the writing was a bout on par with Time to Be Born/Die. Parts of it read like sloppy fan fiction and other times I felt like I was reading a ""clip show"" as the author constantly recalled various scenes that played out in the TV series. While there were some interesting parts towards the end of the book, they revolved mostly around the battle that the rebel Romulans fought against the Praetor. All in all, it was not a book I enjoyed very much even though I liked where they moved Picard and Beverly's relationship to."
5,A very underrated Star Trek novel.,"I have not read a Star Trek book for ages. This was the first one I read. Perhaps because everything is new again for me even a bad book would be good. I'm also a big fan of Picard and Doctor Crusher, and the novel centres on these two characters. There is a lot of Romulan machinations (Sela being one of the villains), devious plots and the lengths Picard goes to save Dr Crusher is amazing. You get a lot of flashbacks of Picard and Dr Crusher's lives. This was great. For example you really feel sorry for Picard as his best friend marries the woman he loves (Beverly).I won't give much more away except that the end is very satisfying for Dr Crusher and Picard fans."
4,Picard and Crusher Issue,"Death in Winter brings Picard and Crusher together at last. For so long, they have kept a certain ammount of distance, and we get to hear what they are thinking about the issue they have. We also get to see why Crusher became a doctor. This story also follows up with what is happening on Romulus after Shinzon's fall. Sela is up to her typical tactics and goes after Picard. I enjoyed this follow up to Nemesis, which puts an end to the Picard/Crusher issue. I wanted to see more of the other characters, but this story mainly focused on Picard and Crusher."
3,Pretty Good,"A decent read that I enjoyed. It isn't the best Star Trek book but it isn't bad either. The best part about it is also the most obvious. And I don't think I'm spoiling anything by saying, Picard and Crusher finally get together!"
4,Good Book,"Yaron Ezrahi is a very smart political observer. He feeds many other writers with his original insights. I liked the personal feeling at the beginning of the book, the story of almost losing his manuscript, the scene with his father and son watching TV. Those kind of images brought me into Israel and a relation with the author. Maybe I'm not as interested in theory as others. Or maybe the writing in ""Rubber Bullets"" becomes too dense, but the second 2/3r's of the book were more theoretical, less effective for this reader. But an important scholar and this reader hopes his next book will be more personal."
5,"Great Book, a scream from a conscientious man",I would recommend this book for any Jew or Israeli with an open mind and a will to understand that there are other opinions.
3,Not as Good as Voodoo Dreams,Voodoo Season is the 2nd book in the Marie Laveau series by Jewell Parker Rhodes. There is a huge chronological gap from the 1st novel that ended in 1822 to the 2nd novel that takes place in 2005. I wish the 2nd novel was the story of Marie and her baby girl that she had with John. It would have been interesting to see the dynamic between the two women considering Marie murdered her abuser/lover for survival. Voodoo season only teases you with tidbits of information about Marie and her daughter and how the family split in 2. There was obviously a story before this story (voodoo season)that should have been written. The whole drunken chief of medical staff was completely far fetched and insulting to southerners. Dr.DuLac should have been portrayed with more dignity and self-respect considering he was a dark-skin black man who went through medical school and was practicing medicine in a southern state. Overall I give the book a C-.
2,Couldn't follow the author,"I have read different fictional books on the topic of Voodoo and thought this one was going to be especially good as one of my favorite authors, Tananarive Due, gave a review on it. I was disappointed however. I think throughout the book the author might assume you are following right with her but I was lost and felt she was leaving information out. I was drawn in for maybe the first half but then she lost me. Overall I think the story had potential but it's unlikely I'll read this author again."
3,Amazon oops,"The Album Description does not match the album here, Amazon made a boo-boo. If fixed, please remove this ""review""."
5,Fantastic Fantasy,"This is a contemporary fantasy at its best. With STEEL ROSE, Kara Dalkey has provided one of the most entertaining novels I've read this summer. This is a superbly crafted story that entertwines aspects of fantasy with popular folklore.When young perfromance artist T.J. Kaminski enlists the help of two ""tommyknockers"" to make her perfomrnaces reach people more deeply, she becomes the target of a group of elves who don't appreciate her ""magical assistance.""Don't overlook this book done in first person perspective. It hooks you on the first page and never lets you go.Casey Thomaston"
3,Life on Lifes Terms,"I found this book very gritty, down to earth and validating. It speaks deeply to the daily life of a working poor she/he.A good read for other she/he's looking for validation in a very cruel male world."
4,A Must For All Mystery Fans,"I would like to write areview of a book called The Case of the Missing Hamster. I like to read all kinds of mystery books. This is a book from the series Jigsaw Jones. I liked it because it talked about ways to figure out things. For one, a girl uses her senses because she was allergic to animal fur. I recommend the book to mystery fans. The series includes The Case of The Runaway Dog, The Case of the Secret Valentine, The Case of The Missing Hamster, The Case of The Christmas Snowman, The Case of the Spooky Sleepover, The case of the Stolen Baseball Cards, The case of the Mummy Mystery, and coming soon, The case of the Great Sled Race. Go to your local library and check out one of these books!"
3,An okay read for little guys,"I think my 7 year old grandson has read too many of his older brothers' books for this one to work for him. I thought it was cute, but he wasn't impressed."
4,"The Case of Hermie the Missing Hamster (Jigsaw Jones Mystery, No. 1)","I purchased this for my Grandson, he really enjoys this series. I have never read these books personally, so I must go with his opinion."
2,"Book ruined by ""ora"" custom code and tags.","If you want to learn about Hans Bergsten's custom ""ora"" beans, then buy this book. He has taken the brunt of the Java code used in the JSP pages and hidden it in his own Beans. For example, he reimplemented JDBC and hid it in his own ""ora"" beans. To make matters worse he relies heavily on XML tags to implement JSP, instead of embedded code (<% ... %>). This makes his code hard to read and debug.I had to skip several chapters that tried to teach me about his ridiculous ""ora"" beans used mostly within XML tags, instead of teaching me how to write Java in JSP. It's a shame since the guy is a decent writer, but he is definitely not a professional programmer. He's an amateur showing off his own beans at the cost of forgetting to teach JSP."
1,Pick a different book,"First things first, I am commenting on the FIRST EDITION. Sadly, the author has chosen to use tags, custom tags in most of the examples. Tags should have been described / explained in a separate chapter, as an optional feature of JSP pages. All I wanted was a simple book to use for quick reference while developing JSP pages. While much of what most developers may want to find is probably in this book, the tags make finding what you want a bit more difficult.To be fair... there are some very good explanations on server side architectural models. (e.g. JSP coupled with ""controller"" servlets, database persistence objects and biz objects) for example running under Tomcat.Anyhow, unless you want to wade through custom tags, buy a different book."
1,Disappointed from O'Reilly,"This is a very disappointed book. Chapter 14 sais ""If you haven't worked with servlets, I recommend that you read up on them ( try Jason Huneter and William Carwford's Java Servlet Programming..."" This chapter is for Servlets. In the beginning of chapter 17 sais ""I recommend that you look at the JDBC documentation on line at ... or read a book about JDBC, such George Reese's Database Programming with JDBC and Java."" This chapter is for developing databases. The chapter 15 ""Developing JavaBeans for JSP"" does't explain how to compile the beans nor how to install them. The first 12 chapters are not for programmers they are for page authors (but I don't thing a page author that uses dreamweaver and flash can understand this section), and the chapters from the 13th to the 17th that are supposed to be for programmers sugest you should read other books. Now I have to buy another book if I really want to lern about JSP's. I do not recomend this book."
1,Not very good way to learn JSP!,"Not a very good book to learn JavaServer Pages from. Too much emphasis on JavaBean development and Tag library creation. A good JavaServer pages book will stress teaching JSP and Java Servlets creation. Also, didn't care for the examples or writing style.May I recommend either: Core Servlets and JavaServer Pages (JSP) by Marty Hall and/or Java Server Pages Application Development by Ben Forta,"
2,Poorly edited,"One problem I have with O'Reilly books is that the authors seem to have no sense of how to frame explanations for beginners. They characterize a book or chapter of a book as being aimed at beginners, then assume knowledge only an experienced person would have.I bought this book simply because it was recently published and I wanted an explanation of the new ""Expression Language"" and other new JSP features. I haven't worked my way through it completely yet, but so far I'm amazed at the number of typos and gramatical mistakes."
2,Get the first edition if you can,"The first edition of this book is wonderful if you can get it. Unfortunately, in the second edition, the author concentrated so much on JSTL that it was a less useful book."
5,Outstanding!!!,I would have liked to give it 10 stars if it were possible. I purchased a copy of this book and I have a whole JSP application in production using the JSP Tags from this book within a month. Each and every example worked and the supporting text made it very convenient.Hans Bergsten has done a great favor to the Java developer community through this book.
3,Core book from a high level,"This book is a good high-level book to understand primary concepts of jsp development and proper architecture design. The code isn't as tight as it should be, but the core concept is there. Although, I'm glad I have this book I would suggest just sitting down with a coffee and scanning it in a bookstore; you'll experience the same effect. I'm going to purchase Web Development with Java Server Pages (ISBN: 1884777996) and Core Servlets and Java Server Pages (ISBN: 0130893404) next.If you're bloody new, pick this one up. If you have had any experience at all, I would steer clear from this book."
3,Disappointed reader,"I spent one hour reading this book at Barnes & Noble B&M this weekend. When I entered the store, I planned to buy it. However, I decided not to buy this book when I left. The author noticed that JSP-Servlet-Enterprise JavaBeans architecture is the most complicated one but also the best architecture for enterprise solutions. However, he just discussed how to use JavaBeans. Be aware that this is not a good approach for developing enterprise application. How to control security? How to manage resources? How to control transaction? You may develop a system very quickly using JavaBeans. Later you find that you have to write code for manage transaction, security, connection pool etc. I suggest the author write several chapters discussing JSP-Servlet-Enterprise architecture. The book also contains around 170 pages of API documents. I suggest buying another book: Web Development with Java Server Pages."
3,not for Java programmers,"Excellent writing style. BUT, I concur with another reviewer - too many details are left out of the first few chapters and there is an over-reliance on the O'Reilly tag library. I like books that do not require me to download sample code and sit in front of a PC to understand. The writing should be self-contained.Overall - it reads quite well. But my frustration peaked after chapter 8."
1,Disappointing Title From a Usually Great Publisher,"How disappointing. This usually great publisher seems to be relying on its name alone to sell books these days. This book doesn't yield anything not already coverd in the JSP books that are already out there, despite the lenghth of time between them."
2,Not a very good book,"Up until now I've been very happy with the O'Reilly series of books. This text however is not written as well as others from this publisher. The author seems unorganized as he is presenting the material, often making reference to later chapters for examples. Perhaps trying to present JSP from a HTML and a developer prospective is hard to do."
5,Great Book,"This is a great book: it was written by a key contributor not only to the JSP specification, but also to the JSP and Servlet reference implementations. Filled with useful examples, it stands as an important text in the adoption of JSP in the market."
5,The Best Celtic Christmas Album,I recently purchased this album and can't recommend it enough! I have been a big fan of Cherish the Ladies for many years but I'm so happy they made a holiday album because I own many celtic Christmas albums and this is the best yet! Beautiful stunning singing from Heidi Talbot backed by the wonderful harmonies in favorite songs of the holidays and ones that I didn't know but are sure to become new favorites. The tunes are interspersed with wonderful traditional music - Joanie Madden leads the band with her masterful whistle playing setting the tone for a great foot stomping album that I know won't be leaving my Disc player for the holiday season!
5,"A wonderful alternative to ""traditional"" Christmas music","What? You're tired of ""traditional"" Christmas music? I can't imagine why, they only play the same 20 songs nonstop for 3 months a year in every shopping venue in America.If you want something different that will still appeal to the traditionalists (we all have a few of those in our families), look no further. This is not only a top-notch Christmas album, but generally a top-notch Celtic album as well. Cherish the Ladies is undoubtedly one of the finest Irish groups in the world, not to mention one of the finest all-female groups! This album is a great collection of classic Christmas tunes, some common, some obscure, that will make for such a nice change come this holiday season."
5,Soothing,"Perfectly titled lovely mix of instrumental and vocals. Soothing, inspiring and different from the same old versions of Christmas songs. I loved almost all of the songs."
5,Love this CD...,I love this CD. I'm on Amazon checking out other 'Cherish the Ladies' CDs because I adore this CD so much. I received it as a gift last year and it is my favorite Christmas CD. Enjoy!
3,"Good, but not the best action game on game gear","Ah an old x-men game... I was really excited to have this one, especialy because it was only sell in USA and not in France. It's a cool game, the first levels were easy (level: peace of cake) excepted the last one. You can choose which hero will perform which mission, but you will quickly understand that some stage is much easier with a flying character !The graphics and the animations are good (excepted for Storm who seems to be annoyed with her cape). The difficulty was correct excepted the final stage that seems very difficult (I haven't finish it yet).Conclusion: a good game (more than that for marvel comics' fans), but which seems too short 15-20min to go to the end (I can't finish the game but I met Magneto who is the last boss).A good action game but Shinobi's games were better on game gear."
2,Is essentially useless for monitoring traffic,"This is a great idea but one that is not ready for primetime. The signal is poor so that when it picks up traffic condiditons you are already sitting in traffic (at least for Detroit - maybe other cities are better). The specificity is poor - in other words the symbols don't tell you whether the traffic is very bad (i.e. how slow is the traffic).Also, the quality is only as good as what the device receives - it is actually more accurate to just listen the radio.Maybe the idea with tracking our cell phones will come into fruition some day. For now, I would avoid this device. Too bad."
4,A SciFi title from this clever fantasy author,"This book currently stands alone, but could become the first of a new series. It is not related to the author's Dragon series. My detailed rating would be 4.0 for this book. Carol Dennis has taken a bold stab at science fiction here, from her previous fantasy series. And it reminds me more of Don Callander's work than it does of her other books! Where Callander's stories are filled with down-home Iowa farmboy manners, this book's filled with Pennsylvania Dutch farmboy manners (to me at least!). Once again Carol Dennis manages to successfully walk a treacherous line in her book -- Don Callander's stories get corny quick, but this book somehow avoids that. The characters here are more developed, and much quirkier, than Callander's or Dennis' other books. There seem to be some extraneous plot elements that make the story not feel ""tight"", but the writing is excellent, and the story is really cute!"
4,The Bible of A series,"This book is the bible of A the series motor, well explained but really a reference book and is quite technical"
3,This is a good guide for tuing.,"I have a 1979 B/L Mini 1000. I found this book a little too technical for my taste. I know once I get into the timing and carburator mixtures it will be a huge blessing, but anyone needing to take apart or put together an A Series engine, the better one for that information is the Haynes Manual which I also bought on Amazon.com."
5,Morgus the Magnificient,"Momus Alexander Morgus has alway been an unappreciated and under-rated genius. This film documents that genius and will allow those in the, hopefully more enlightened, future to benifit from his greatness."
4,Masterpiece..sheer genius..never to be duplicated again,This is a great masterpiece of Dr. Morgus. This film greatness will NEVER be duplicated by the greatest Hollywood has to offer.
1,Blood Pressure cuff,"this is an awful product, I sent it back to the manufacturer. Not only the readings are way off (I checked it against 3 other Blood pressure monitors), but it comes in a plastic pouch that reeks of a toxic plastic smell.I would give it a 0 if I could. do not waste your time or money."
1,bad product,"the reason you buy a blood pressure cuff is because some one's health hinges on the ability to have a b.p. taken and for it to be accurate. This b.p. cuff doesn't read correctly, sometimes won't inflate, and it has a really nasty smell that doesn't seem to go away."
5,BP & stheoscope set,"Just what I was looking for, it was affordable and I recieved it in a reasonable amount of time. I needed a BP & stheoscope set for my medical assiting class, I am a working student, so I needed the set to be cheap and recieve it rather quickly so I could have all my required materials for my program. Thank you for sending my set so quickly."
3,Functional product,"The product is functional, meets the need for a standard bld pressure cuff and scope. Nothing fancy, just what you need.Thanks"
3,Not what i ordered but okey controller,I ordered this controller but got a different one that was listed here very disappointed. Although the one i got i could of got for 6 bucks on this sight http://www.amazon.com/Classic-6-Button-Controller-Not-Machine-Specific/dp/B002HP18IO/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1299797858&sr=8-1 . The controller i received is okay and will do the job.
2,The Controller?,"The only good thing I can say about this controller is that it works. It will allow you to play some of the older Sega Genesis games which cannot be played on the newer controllers, but thats it! It's combersome, bulky and doesn't even look the same as in the picture."
4,Dangerous Loves,"This book was really good. I especially liked the ending. But I rate it 4 stars because it was really easy to guess who the culprit was. However the end was really awesome. And if u love ""Ohmigosh, whats gonna happen?! R they gonna be ok?!"" endings then I encourage u to read this book!"
4,By a Thread,i absolutely loved this book; its a great book for children. It is fun and creative!The way Ned Dickens has presented this book is by far genius. Kids can have a great time reading it because of his different ways of presenting the words on paper and his pleasent rhymes.One way to describe it...Creativity is its own playground.
2,Alot of the same over and over,"I found this to be alot of the same over and over without alot of original insight. Very well written and really heartfelt, but substance lacking for scholarly or serious study."
4,"Fine movie with Lola, Lolita.","Fine movie all around.Good singing, good dancing, I enjoyed it. I wish she would have done more like this. Most of her movies are Mexican productions for the local audience. She went for the bucks and, not for the quality in general. Kind of like Spain's answer to Elvis. I wish more of her old movies would be released in DVD."
1,Incomprehensible Book,This is supposed to be a contemporary translation that uses language relevant to our time and culture. It seems to me that the author must be using some sort of inner city street lingo that leaves out normal English-speaking people. I could not recognize Thomas a Kempis in this translation at all. I found it to be unreadable.
1,"Contemporary translation, or silly hipster paraphrase?","A pretentious, flippant paraphrase, and hipster trite at that. I'd be happy to see an accurate, plain translation; but this was an unamusing waste. After reading this, I'd have no idea what the original said, nor why anyone would want to read Thomas a Kempis. It's also filled with silly apologetic editorializing, explaining the silly manner of translating.It is labeled ""A Contemporary Translation"" on the cover. Oh, really?"
3,It's just this shower head hook,"Not available at Home Depot any longer, glad it is available here. These wear out every couple of years. When I bought my current house this Alsons apparatus was all ready here. I would not buy this new if I were replacing my entire shower wand assembly."
2,Not like picture.,"The picture for this product is different from what was actually shipped. All that will be shipped will be the mask, without filters. So you'll have to buy the filters separately. The mask is pretty good, though. It seems to fit well (lack of leaks), and even after an hour or 2 doesn't hurt."
5,"sweet , seductive tenor sax man","Perhaps nothing's as intriguing musically as the seductive sound of the tenor sax when it's in the right hands . Gato Barbieri has been playing his seductive style for many years and some of what he's written will always be remembered. Shadow Of The Cat is his best effort since Tropico , although there's no real standout smokers like the tenor sax / guitar duet a-la "" Latin Lady "" with Carlos Santana on Tropico , you definately won't be dissapointed with the updated version of "" Last Tango "" and the great guitar playing of Jeff Mironov. This cd is one that's worth having if you're a gato fan. And one that has the definitive passion & style that are trademark to gato's musical style."
3,Old is New Agin,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book, which takes golf swing instructions from the late Great Abe Mitchell. Like the old adage, old is new again. This instruction compared to today's modern instruction and is right on. Comparing old photo's of Mitchell's swing (developed over a hundred years ago) to today's great players, is prof that not much other than the equipment has changed. Golf officiants, would be well served to review this book. Instructions, graphics and photos are excellent, given the time and technology available at that time. Highly recommend this book. Just a little bit of history, Abe Mitchell, a Englishman, is the golf pro who taught Sam Ryder how to play golf. Ryder is the father of the Ryder cup, and Abe's small statue happens to be on the top of the Ryder Cup. Secondly, Abe held the longest drive of the day, coming in at 312 yards, this rivals today's greats, and he was using hickory shafts and untried balls. Regards Jerry Bollinger"
5,excellent,arrived quickly and in perfect condition. Best money spent- now my son can leave the heavy book in the locker and come home and do his homework still!
2,what's it really for?,still don't know what this is for. never used it. thought it was to hold the can while spraying but it's not.
4,Interesting and accessible,"I've heard several Rough Guide CDs that I've enjoyed, and I bought this one out of curiosity (I'm planning a trip to China next year).I hadn't really even expected to like this-- in fact I thought it would just remain a curiosity-- but I have to say that it's my favorite of the Rough Guide series. It's very exotic yet somehow remains accessible, and I'm impressed at how diverse the selections are yet it still maanges to be fairly cohesive.If you're at all interested in Chinese culture, or if you're interested in exploring world ""pop"" music, you'll be charmed by this CD."
5,Versatile Mix Spans Centuries,"I wanted some music to accompany a slide show I was making of China trip photos. This is perhaps the best mix that includes contemporary hits as well as classics from every era. In the process of listening, I learned alot about Chinese culture. The song notes inside the cover are very educational and informative. Good job, Rough Guides."
2,Lacks thorough explanations,"For first-time learners, this is not a very good textbook. The context of most chapters lacks basic explanations that would give individuals new to the language more confidence. It just does not explain the usage of many elements of the grammar as well as it should, and it often takes important informantion and squeezes it into a corner of the page where it can often be overlooked. There are some fill-in-blank activities in the book, but there are no answers to be found, anywhere. I am thoroughly disappointed in my college for selecting this book."
4,Very good traditional performance,"Actually I would rate it 4 1/2 stars. The singers and conducting are excellent, the sets and costumes are excellent (very traditional) The reason I don't give it 5 stars is because the opera has some tedious sections. If you love Meistersinger, you will probably give this DVD 5 stars."
3,Mediocre - but only just.,"This version is an undisguised copy of the 1951 Beyreuth production and suffers from being produced in the New World where many things can be done well but few, excellently. The Metropolitan is in this mould - whether it is Vaudeville or Wagner, both will be done with great competence but without brilliance.Brilliance, alas, is what is needed in Wagner and it is a pity that the orchestra and chorus cannot be given a conductor of equal ability."
2,Very Disappointed,"Eva, who according to the story line, was supposed to be Paradise itself, yet this Eva was incredibly 'common.' She flirts while in church, and sadly, behaves well, very common.Do not know if its the fault of the director.Buying a European version of one of my favorite operas, especially the third act."
1,absolutely dreadful,"What a travesty! James Morris can barely sing, swooping and scooping into every note. He has no concept of the role which is typical for him. Levine's conducting, as in all of his Wagner, is terrible, having no understanding whatsoever. He rushes for cheap effect then slows to a crawl to appear ""sensitive."" Having Thomas Allen as Beckmesser is interesting as he should be Sachs. Here is Beckmesser giving Sachs a singing lesson as Allen's beautiful tone and smooth production are what Wagner wanted. Heppner is fine as Walter but the opera depends more on conducting and the Sachs, both absent here. Anyone who praises this garbage doesn't know anything about Wagner and their reviews should be ignored."
5,Wanted to send one to every one of my sisters!,I couldn't put this book down. I opened it standing at my kitchen counter and read the first three chapters standing there. I ordered 6 copies for gifts before finishing the book. It is a wonderful book giving us permission to truly be ourselves without apology or even explainations and letting our own delicious creativity run free
3,Erma Bombeck for the 2000's,"I purchased this book online after reading the reviews and sample pages! I thought this was the greatest thing I have read since Erma Bombeck, then I learned that the book deals with some issues of incest, which the author is dealing with. That part caught me off guard. I bought two copies, one to give to a friend and now I'm not sure if this is the perfect gift to give.The majority of Succulent Wild Woman is fantastic! And I recommend it, but I want people to know that she does talk about her incest experience. If I had known about this, I would have chosen a different one of her books to start with. I do like that the book looks handwritten and hand painted with neat little illustrations in and out and around the text. This is a good book for inspiring, young women. A good book to read with your daughters and talk through some of the deeper issues."
3,SARK the repeater,"I've read most of SARK's books and found that she tends to repeat herself within a book and between books......so, once you've read ONE of her books, you need to read no more.....they say the same thing in different words and different pictures."
1,"Trite, juvenile fluff","If I'd known that I could photocopy all my journal entries and telephone scribbles and sell them as a self-help book, I would still be too embarrassed to foist them off on unsuspecting gift recipients, like me. Because that's the only reason I have this book--it was a gift. What in the world is this SARK person on...Prozac? Is she free-basing St. John's Wort? Intraveneous coffee drip? I don't know, but there is one thing she could definitely use--an editor. What a waste of paper."
5,This book is a great lesson in awakening yourself.,This book is a great teacher and remindes you to be yourself and to be happy and outgoing. Its a great way to end the day and awaken all aspects of the way you see things and how to rethink to get a positive out of everything. I reccomend this book tto anyone from young to old.
5,Succulent Sark Book!,A friend got me this book two Christmases ago and I love it and have reread it several times! It is a wonderful book for women who want to feel good about being female! Sark has such a fun and understanding way of sharing the things that women go through and deal with. It is full of inspiration and all the fabulous art and quotes Sark is so famous for! I highly recommend this book for all women to enjoy! I have purchased it for several friends as gifts since it was given to me!
3,WILD!,"This book was WILD alright. It was all over the place! I mean, I liked the meaning of the story, but the story made me really dizzy! It was told from a different perspective and I get that, but I couldn't keep reading it. I was too scatter brained after the first few ""chapters"" or pages. Long story short: Don't be afraid to show your wild side. Be creative. Be you. Be positive. Have fun in life. Enjoy!"
5,Sark is amazing...,"I picked up this book a few years ago when I was going through my divorce. It was one of the lowest points in my life. When I started to read this book, it empowered me to be who I really am...not what others think I should be. I still have the book in my nightstand and pick it up and read some of it when I'm not feeling great about myself. I think every woman should read Sark....especially this book. Every woman should feel succulent!"
5,Wonderful book!,"I'm recommending this book because I think we all tend to take ourselves WAY too seriously sometimes (often!), and ""Succulent Wild Woman"" is a great primer for showing us how to take a step back and truly appreciate the core of who we are. Besides that, it's a quick read, so not having enough time is not a valid excuse!Enjoy!"
4,SWW,"Succulent Wild Woman, I think I am at the age that I can be myself with SARK's encouragement and live how I want to live without having to worry about what others think about me. Her book has some great advice about different aspects of your life and how to not be so afraid and let go of what others think and try to be happy with who you are. I have 4 other books by SARK and they are great as well.Prosperity Pie : How to Relax About Money and Everything Else,Sark's Journal and Play!Book : A Place to Dream While Awake,Make Your Creative Dreams Real: A Plan for Procrastinators, Perfectionists, Busy People, and People Who Would Really Rather Sleep All Day,Transformation Soup: Healing for the Splendidly Imperfectall really great and uplifting reads."
4,"Good info, hard to see visually","Nice book....I appreciate the author's writing style, however the use of multi-colored text combined with the funky fonts makes it difficult to read."
5,FABULOUS! Absolutely inspiring! Become Succulent,"Every woman should read this book! SARK can inspire you to ""dance naked by moonlight"" and learn more about yourself and the world in the process. I am working on becoming a Succulent Wild Woman and trying to help others to be more free, open and Succulent. Thank you SARK for being such an inspiration."
5,Handy Sprayer,Great little product. Super price on Amazon (beat most of the competition I could find!). Saves a lot of strain on these old hands. Recharges quickly and is so simple. Love it.
4,Howling V The Rebirth,"I don't care what anybody else says, Howling V: The Rebirth is an awesome horror movie. When I was a kid, my mom allowed me to rent Howling V: The Rebirth and watch it. For years it gave me terrible nightmares. I had a wild imagination back then and it often got the better of me whenever I watched certain certain things. A group of heirs are invited to a Hungarian castle for a secret werewolf bust. The guests realize to their horror that they are being hunted down by evil. They all have the same birth mark. One of them is a werewolf, and it can only be destroyed by one of its own, someone who has the mark. Howling VI: The Freaks is a pretty cool horror film too. But I like Howling V better. I am glad this movie is finally on DVD."
2,Where'd The FEAR Go????,"Remember the first time you watched the original ""Howling""? Remember the sense of fear that would build up when you saw the moon was out? And when you knew the werewolves were near? Remember the macabre foreboding feeling you got while watching the entire movie? That was what made the original ""Howling"" a great movie. But by now, the whole formula's gotten old. The second ""Howling"" was alright, so was the third, and it started getting old on the fourth, but there is no need for a fifth, and definetly not a sixth. It's time to call it quits with this series. They're just gonna keep releasing crappy sequels like they did with ""Halloween"" and Jason until it's completely ruined. The whole formula's not scary anymore. Either try something new or STOP."
4,entertaining and fast paced,"Chapter headings (see Swan Song), setting (Gone South) and writing style make me think this is the work of Robert R. McCammon writing under a pseudonym. As good as his acknowledged work, but too similar to the others to publish as his. The same goes with Blood Kin, a mid south version of They Thirst. Good stuff for horror fans no matter who wrote it."
4,Good read,"Good book. I would recommend it. Captures your attention pretty quickly. The main character is a ten year old boy instead of some muscle bound soldier, which is different. This little kid has to fight evil and find a way to kill a monster that has crawled out of Fear County."
1,a slow boring book that climaxes in the last chapter,"I first picked up this book at a used book store out of boredom and because I need to fill my trade in credit. This book takes tooo long to reach its point. The monster is attacking a small town. The ""hero"" spends almost the whole book travling to see a witch doctor to obtain a ""weapon"" to kill the creature. The return trip takes only half a chapter and the resulting ""battle"" is over in just a few pages. I was bored with this book and have since put it back into the used book recyling system in another used book store. GLAD I ONLY paid a dollar for this since the book and the story wasn't even worth THAT much money!"
2,Didn't Finish,"The southern colloquialisms are overplayed and often clunky. The narrative is good but wordy at times, and because of this, FEAR often reads like a young adult novel. The author portrays the relationships of the main characters well, and this was almost enough to keep me reading, but I just couldn't get past Jeb's refusal to help Troy. A boy finds another boy trapped in a dangerous situation and he turns his back after only a minimum effort to help? I found that counter-intuitive. And that, combined with the book's other flaws, was excuse enough for me to set FEAR aside."
3,Chanting 101,"Provides a good overview of world chant. You certainly can't go wrong starting here but if you are a serious explorer seeking to delve into the more esoteric realms of toning, chant, healing with sound vibration and the ""sound current"", check out my favorite new sound healing find: Travelling the Sacred Sound Current: Keys for Conscious Evolution"" (book & cd) by vibrational healer Deborah Van Dyke...its a spiritual treasure."
5,ADVENTURES BEYOND THE SOLAR SYSTEM: PLANETRON AND ME,"Originally purchased this wonderful book for my son when he was four years old. It taught him basic information about our solar system that I mistakenly thought he was too young to understand. The data was presented in an informative and entertaining way. The book that I purchased came with a cassette tape and he was able to read along. He read and re-read the book so many times that he wore out the binding. The story is of a young boy who is befriended by ""Planetron."" As I remember, Planetron, a robot, takes him on a tour of the solar system. The book is colorfully illustrated with pictures of the planets and sun. Information about each celestial body is displayed with the picture. My son is 19 years old now and recently mentioned that it is the one book he really remembers and would like to keep as a momento of his childhood."
1,"Buggy, terrible piece of software.","[...]In addition to the 3MB memory problem, which has no excuse, I encountered an even more frustrating and obvious bug in the program.They MISSPELLED THIER OWN DIRECTORY! The result was that the install ended with an eror telling me that they could not find the directory and that it did not exist.This error, along with the 3MB error caused confusion as to the true cause of the problem.I have had this program for 10min, and that was all the time it has taken to get the feeling that ENCORE put out a buggy, untested steamy pile that is good for nothing but frustrating the buyer. I will never purchase another encore product, and advise agianst anyone else who values their time and sanity to do so."
1,$40 + junk = angry customer,"This is a faulty and buggy piece of software. It will not run on my PC (XP Home)without me changing my Virtual Memory from 1000 mb to 200 mb...what an absurdity! The developer offers no solution other than to change my VM everytime I want to use their software.Well, forget it. They're not the only game in town."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!,"(...) It tells me that ""Director Player 6.0 - This program requires at least 3MB of free virtual memory to run."" I have 1023MB of RAM on my Windows XP machine. Tells me I'm missing some links so the install obviously does not work properly either.This software does not work. I'm returning this piece of expensive JUNK!!!ENCORE, fix these problems before shipping products. (...)"
1,Watch Out!,"This software really scrambled my computer. Had to reinstall numerous programs. It created 77 errors in the Registry. I haven't had this much trouble in years. I even created a restore point before installing, but that didn't helpWatch Out!"
5,Comments,"The text's organization and DVD are exceptional. It scaffolds so that students, whether pre-service or in the profession are continually building their knowledge and skills."
2,missing,I am missing the cd that goes along with the book. I was really looking for this for review. disappointed.
1,Missing item,It says that this book comes with a cd and there is no cd included with this book!!! Not satisfied.
5,"If you've enjoyed the first game, you're enjoy this","The 1993 Jurassic Park game for the Sega Genesis was such a huge sucess that the company ordered to make a sequel. The result : Jurassic Park Rampage Edtion. Although the orignal was slighly better, this game has new areas to explore, new raptor moves etc. Chances are if you've liked the first game, more than likely you will like this."
2,Worth it?,"I have the remastered Live in Europe, which sounds horrible. I do have the a version of this one from many years ago. I'm just wondering if this remasterd version has a good sound or not."
4,A Fantastic live record,"I remember borrowing the 2 LP version of this album from my brothers *many many* times... & when I saw the re-release I jumped at the cd. You know how you have a fond memory of an 'old album' and then you re-visit it years later...sometimes it's a luke-warm feeling, sometimes less... R. Gallagher's Irish Tour '74 was 10 times better around this time. ""I Wonder Who"" is a great 12 bar blues work out; ""Tattoo'd Lady"" has some wonderful (blistering) guitar work (I don't remember the LP featuring the piano work so prominently in the mix - I really like it on this tune), ""As the Crow Flies"" is one of my favs - acoustic slide work that blends so very nicely w/ Rory's vocals -Great! and of course, ""A Million Miles Away"" is a gem.If you like Clapton, Stevie Ray, give this cd a try. If you like Rory Gallagher, it's a must have."
5,A good buy!,"If you are thinking of buying only one Rory Gallagher album, this has to be at the forefront of consideration. Rory seems to sound much better live than he does in studio, and Irish Tour '74 is his best live album. Get this one - you won't regret it!"
5,"Rory, we hardly knew ye","Previous reviewers have done a very good job with their high praise of this masterpiece, but there are two things I would like to share with anyone who might be tempted but not yet convinced to add this gem to their collection.First, the blistering, full length Walk On Hot Coals featured on this disc is perhaps Rory and his bandmates at their finest. That cut alone is worth the price of the CD.Second, this cd is a wonderful complement to, not a substitute for, Rory's Irish Tour 74 DVD. Although there is some overlap in the song titles, there is no overlap in the performances. (I really liked the DVD, and almost didn't buy the CD because I thought it would contain mostly the same perfomances. It would be a shame for anyone to make that mistake.)Many thanks to Rory and the boys for these superb performances."
5,Rory Gallagher's Irish Tour,"I came upon Rory Gallagher on Wolfgang's Vault. I don't know how many times I passed over his name only because I didn't know who he was. MY MISTAKE. I believe it was a 1 3/4 hour live concert from 1978. After I played it through, I replayed it in it's entirety, once more. I was instantly a fan. Any one who enjoys blues rock must listen to Rory once. You'll be a fan, too."
4,Great Toy - could be an adult's collectible!,"I purchased this for a grandchild for Christmas. She LOVES this car and takes it everywhere with her. I actually love the van myself. It is sturdy, and very detailed. I thought it would look great on my desk (since I'm a child of the 70's).I may get another one for myself!"
4,For a special kid.,I purchased this as a gift for a first grader who likes almost all Cars from the movie.
1,risky,"The first time I got one of these, it worked easily. Then a second time, replacing a stolen Tomtom and also the stolen Western European SD, the SD did not work. Seller wanted more money, sent outside of Amazon's system, for an upgraded version, even though the models were the same as before. No help sorting out why the problem, although I got a refund of price, but not shipping, upon returning. Still, something fishy, I think. In any case, it may not work."
2,Needs a major update,"I agree that this book is an excellent reference book, but what I am truly disappointed about this book is the fact that this needs a major update. The list of suppliers of urinalysis products, for example, needs to be updated to reflect the current condition. It contains products and companies which are no longer available. Creatinine is a major component of urinalysis today for liver/kidney screening, but it is not even mentioned. The urinalysis field has progressed over the years, and this book should mention a few automated automated microscopic and flow cytometory instruments to benefit readers."
2,They Twist Around,"I bought these socks for my mom for Christmas, and she thought they were nice, until she put them on and found that they twist around, so that the tread ends up on top, and the sock is backwards. A disappointment."
3,what I wanted,"these are basically what I wanted. I have been using Totes slipper socks for years & like them. I was only hoping that, over the years, customers might have encouraged them to put a little more non-stick stuff on the bottom... to assure that it goes over the heel. Inevitably, holes wear through these in the heel. My carpet eats them."
3,socks i purchased,"The logo is misleading as it shows all colors, it should state only 1 color and change the Logo to reflect it."
5,This is for everyone,"I am a long haul truck driver and have alot of time to read. I just finished Mr. Bunicks book, In God's Truth and I have to say, thank you. I finally feel like I fit in. I have never been religious and always felt sort of guilty about it. My wife is always on me to go to church, and when I'm home I try to, but I always feel like I don't belong. After reading this book, I now know that the words of Jesus were meant for everyone, even this tough old truck driver. This book is really for everyone."
4,In God's Truth,"I really enjoyed the book. I felt he rpeated himself alot. I would reccomend this book to who ever wanted in depth from the book, The Messengers."
2,Do YOU believe in angels???,"Nick Bunick dresses up some fundamental truths in Angel'sclothes, which is all well and good as far as it goes: we all couldstand to ""release our anger and hatred and turn it over to God -and dismiss the unloving, disruptive passengers from our journeythrough life"" - but his tone is so patronizing that I foundmyself turned off. It may not be necessary to believe that Nick isthe reincarnation of the Apostle Paul, as he states - but if you DON'Tbuy into it, then why should he have any more credibility than JoeBlow down the street? Some readers might get something useful fromsearching for evidence of angels and God's love through the numbers""444"" - but this strikes me as being as superstitious asthose who fear ""666"" as Satan's sign!? After visiting hiswebsite ... - There are a lot more substantial messages and messengersthan this in the spiritual world!!"
4,It takes a few listens,"After listening to the album the first time through, I wasn't thrilled...but after a few more listens I came to really enjoy and appreciate it. ""I'm in No Mood"" is undeniably catchy--I defy you to not play the air synthesizer. There are a good mix of songs that range in tone--upbeat, carefree, frantic, melancholic. Eleanor's voice is piercing and beautiful as usual. The only song I still don't really care for is ""Bitter Tea""; it sounds like music for some crazy carnival ride. My album has alternate versions of ""Nevers!"" and ""Benton Harbour Blues"", and it was a good call to include them. If Rehearsing My Choir and EP had a baby, you'd get Bitter Tea."
3,So good....and then SCREEEEEEECH!!!!,"Fiery Furnaces is a frustrating experience for me. Most of their songs contain beautiful, beautiful music. For that reason alone I recommend you listen to this album. But be sure to listen before you buy, though, becaue, like me, you might be put off by the following common FF experience: a gorgeous, fun, wacky sequence is interupted by HARSH electronic noise that lasts for longer than you thought it possibly could without the artists thinking it might be a bad idea.FF, I would love you more if you could cut out some of the blatant noise that ruins my enjoyment of many of your songs.That said, FF is an extremely talented and unique product, and anyone who wants a taste of today's pop/rock/electronica avant-garde should check these people out pronto."
3,Not entirely bizarre...,"Took me awhile to get into this CD. And I mean awhile. I rate it three stars because even though the best on this CD is great, there are a few songs that could be better if the Fiery Furnaces would chill out a bit and lay off the drugs/electronic backup. I also would appreciate it if some of the songs made sense. Real music must have some kind of continuity, and a lot of this just doesn't. Bitter Tea, Vietnamese Telephone Ministry. What were you two thinking?So why three stars? I'm in No Mood is good... waiting to know you is also very good. A number of the tracks are tolerable and actually listenable (in a good way) if you sit down and think about it for a moment.Not sure if I'm sold on this band yet."
3,Portishead married They Might Be Giants,"Haven't given it a thorough listen, but the subject line about sums up my first (second) impressionIf you love Portis/TMBG then you'll probably like this."
1,God Awful.,"I believe that the ""EP"" has some great moments like ""Here Comes the Summer,"" which recalls Bowie. But this album is trash. They have good ideas that are promptly DESTROYED with layer upon layer of out-of-place synth skronk that sounds more like bad carnival music than anything else. Way to go, Fiery Furnaces. You managed to create an album that is a prospect for worst album ever recorded. Don't believe the raves from Pitchfork. Spare yourselves. For the love of god."
2,The Furnaces never met a midi plugin they didn't like,"""Teach Me Sweetheart"" and ""Waiting To Know You"" get a lot of play around my parts. Likeable, but heavy on the weirdo synth sounds. Ease off the Pro Tools knobs man!"
1,Poor listing,"White-Washed Finish Splat Back Chair By Acme FurnitureYou would not believe your eyes if you see the picture for this product, and especially the listing that accompanies it. The picture shows one nice looking, wood made, dining chair at a more than reasonable price ($24 or $25 per item, it seems), and everything is wonderful, so far. But when you try to add it to your shopping cart the circus starts: just dare to see the weight of the item, and you'll need ice packs: 100lbs for one chair!!!If you are curious and go further checking their shipping rates, the ice is not going to help you anymore because you'll pass out: about $100 for the same!Clearly, I would not recommend this product to anybody."
2,Back away slowly from this book!,"I'm fairly used to art books presenting dull writing. However, most individuals buy art books to see pictures of art and learn some background about the piece, the artist, the time and context of the art, etc. This book is really meant for the ueber-critic: there are fifteen pages of an esoteric essay that can hardly keep the interest of a serious art critic much less anyone who is thinking that they might actually learn something about Alessi (other than the basics). The pictures of the pieces of Alessi are great (and that is why the book deserves any stars at all). I'm usually not this critical about books, but this book was most likely planned as a coffee table book to show off your Alessi gadgets. As long as no one actually tries to read the text, you'll be ok.Unless this book is dropped into your lap, leave it alone and don't waste your money!"
5,"""Uber text""? Pix are glorious, author curated for the Brit Museum!","I have to toss in my 2 cents' worth on this title, as I was surprised by the lone 2-star review below.This gem is indeed a mini-coffee table production -- the pix are many, varied, beautifully printed on quality semi-gloss stock, and delectable!The text is 15 pages of background and commentary by a guy who curated the Modern collection at the British Museum from 1979-86 and has written several books on post-modernism; it includes footnotes citing Walter Benjamin, Calinescu, and a Paul Goldberger New Yorker article, as well as Investor's Chronicle. Youse gotta problem wit' dat?Uber text, schmoober text -- whatever. Just *do* add this mini-ogle to your Alessi bookshelf, your designer shelf, your homeware shelf, maybe even your PoMo coffee table (what, you don't have one?!?) -- in short, chill out, enjoy the yummies, and learn a bit about what Alessi thinks he's doing with all these post-groovy products...."
1,The worse technical support ever,"I have bought Motion Dive Tokyo in 2005 year, the console is really beautiful, but I did't feel confortable with the technical support of this product, merchandising is great, it makes you feel you are getting a great thing to mix video, also now the technical support won't give you any answer because the production of this software and hardware has stoped and about the free plug ins they offer in the web site they don't work"
4,Thank you!,I've been looking for an affordable version of this book for YEARS. (Collectible copies of the original hardcovers go for up to $400.) Mr. Satterthwait tackles a century-old conundrum with imagination and humor. Did she or didn't she?
1,Don't be fooled,I bought this hammer because i bang in 400 to 500 16's duplexes a day building exterior walls for a pier were doing.The description says 16oz but they fail to mention that the steel head weighs 7.3 ounces making this bad boy weigh 23.03 oz no-good defeats the point of buying a 16oz hammer.The head is constantly coming loose no matter what i took it back and now am buying a 16 oz dalluge because this one sucked.
4,Very nice hammer..,This is a very nice hammer for a combination of steel and titanium..its very light and easy to swing all day. only draw back is that I find the handle is a bit slick. otherwise I will continue to buy the replacement faces as they wear out.
1,blurred image,"monitor was fine for first couple weeks, then it developed an extreme blurring problem; i've so far been unable to get their tech support team to help me. :("
1,Don't bother to buy this DVD,"Extremely disappointing DVD. The story of Paul's discovery and rise to fame is surely worth telling but this DVD fails miserably. It features short sections of the 3-4 stages of the talent show that led to his fame but NO EFFORT has been made to add anything at all to these short edited TV sections.If you buy the music CD you'll see that Paul's most important note of thanks is to his wife Julie-Ann for being his constant support. She isn't mentioned once on the DVD - how's that for disrespect to this remarkable man. You'll learn as much about Paul and his beautiful voice from the notes on the DVD box as you will from the short excerpts from the TV shows (each is only about 3-4 minutes).And the price of said DVD.........ridiculous ..... you could create this program by editing at home - must have cost about $5 to produce.In summary, the great shame about this DVD is that we would like to know much more about Paul but you'll learn next to nothing."
5,The best video game anime ever created.,"To like this movie, you don't even have to know what the whole series is based upon. Awesome animation, cool dubbing, and great music make this my favorite anime ever!!!"
1,Burned out,"I purchased this drive on sale from a local store to replace a smaller one I was storing my pictures on. I was able to copy about 100 gb before it magically turned into a brick. Luckily the store had similar complaints and returned my money without a problem. Sorry, can't recommend Seagate anymore."
1,Buyers be aware!,"The 300G seagate external drive I bought two months ago died today. If you check the review of 300G 400G external drives, you'll see it's a common problem for seagate 300G+ drives. I assume seagate external drives use the exactly same internal drives with the matching capacity. If this is the case, this seagate 300G internal drive is also doomed. Don't waste your money, and more importantly, your precious data and time on this drive."
1,Seagate Barracua 7200.8 400GB Ultra ATA/100 Internal Hard Drive,"I should have listen to all the bad reviews about this drive. I went with the good reviews instead, and also because it was on sale for $99.99. Big mistake. Wasted 2 hours transferring data to this extra drive, then it clashed. This drive was extremely hot as I was checking to see what was happening. I could have used it to iron my clothes! Needless to say, I removed the drive, return it, and swear I'll never get another Seagate. I wish I could rate this drive a minus 5 stars."
1,Another failure....,"As others have noted, this drive is starting to get a reputation for failure. I have two in a PowerPC with a probably 75% a week uptime. One of the two became flaky after about 6 months. It finally gave up the ghost this week. I would recommend stearing clear. I'm about to find out if I will be steering clear of all Seagate drives in the future (depending on how they handle warranty service)."
4,Great Price - Irksome XP setup,"The new Seagate 400GB drive comes with DiscWizard for Windows. I found that this program must be run no less than three times to partition and format the drive beyond 127GB without overlay drivers, at least in Windows XP Home. The first time you have to settle for 127GB, which is a bummer if you're replacing a larger boot drive and copying all of your files. Then you reboot. The second time you have to confirm that you want to enable large disk drive access, then reboot. On the third boot, you can specify the larger / new partition(s). Still, its hard to beat the capacity for the price."
3,has some good songs,"love Kool Keith and all of his personas. however this was a somewhat miss, the title song is good but most of the other songs are lacking."
2,my computer keeps ejecting the disk,"With the awesomeness of the Project Polaroid album fresh in my mind I started uploading my old Kool Keith albums to the iPod today. Well, this disk keeps getting spit back out my computer... If this isn't a hint I don't know what is.Definitely pick up the Polaroid disk and even if you are trying to complete a Kool Keith collection, consider leaving Undertakerz out."
5,An Excellent Primer on the Fundamentals of Fishing Lures,"I've been a casual fisherman all of my life. However, I've always fished with natural baits and never seriously tried artificial lures. To be honest, I've been bewildered by the hundreds of shapes and colors available at the local Wal-Mart. This book does an excellent job of sorting all of these lures into several catagories. It then goes on to explain the theory behind each catagory of lure and which techniques to use for each of them. While I'm sure there is a lot of good information here for experienced fisherman, this book is especially useful to newcomers who wish to try lures, but who don't know which ones to buy or understand how to use them. Reading this book will save you money, as it will help you select the few lures you really need and teach you how to use them effectively."
5,These great stories...,"...convinced me that horror fiction wasn't just a ""slum"" genre, that it was in fact home to some of the best writing ever set to paper. Elisabeth Engstrom's ""When Darkness Loves Us"" changed my perception of the short story. In just a few pages she makes a more profound impact on the emotions of the reader than most 500-page novels. This book is a startling demonstration of craft and fine storytelling."
5,when Helping you is hurting me.,"When Helping You is Hurting Me is an excellent resource for people who find themselves repeating a distructive pattern of ""Helping too Much"". The misnomer is that we are taught to help others and keep on giving and when we've been raised that way it is not easy to stop even when we fall on our faces.I found this to be a real ""KEY"" to my own healing and understanding of why I did what I did for so long even at the risk of my own health and happiness.Thanks to the author for such insights and research. Faye Hobbs, Transformational Learning"
4,When Helping You is Hurting Me,"If you are one who likes to help others and particularly are in a helping profession, this book is a must for self-awareness regarding your motives. Berry gives many believable examples and helps one make a plan for being free from over indulging yourself in helping others. Easy to read, it took me three chapters before I was ready to admit that this is me she is talking about. My boss gave me this book to read."
4,Excellent Introduction to Classic Films on DVD,"This is an excellent book for younger collectors who may not know about classic films. Also, I think it would make a good gift this holiday season, especially for those folks getting a new DVD player. The book was fun to read with lots of good information on collecting DVDs."
5,Two Thumbs up,This book illustrates all the necessities to obtaining the best home movie collection. It is wonderful and a must have for everyone.
4,A compelling chronology of the Sioux wars.,"Greene is a very knowlegeable historian of the Sioux Wars. In this work, he has edited and commented upon reports of Officers and others who were participants in this monumental struggle between the Sioux and their Cheyenne allies and the White soldiers of the frontier army. A great book to assist the historian in understanding the hardships of a winter campaign against hostiles on the northern plains."
1,I can't believe this is by the author of The Game,"UGH!!! Are you kidding me?!? I don't expect much from romance novels, but this one was just the worst! The so called hero and heroine were so weak and sniveling I found myself rooting for the villains. Of course there's nothing wrong with a flawed hero, but this guy was just down right useless and boring. And, the most convoluted part was that the heroine held the key to her freedom all along and never utilized it to all their benefit. I hope the next novel takes a 180 degree turn for the better."
1,Finished...finally!!,What a book. I can't think of any thing good to say. Hannah was the only likeable character. The rest were weak and/or disgusting. The fact that I was 10 pages from the end and could put it down until the next day says something. Save your money. I have read a few others by this author and cannot really recommend her.
4,"A very well thought out, complex plot...","If you like light and airy romance, this AIN'T the book for you. If you want a dose of realism in your romance, then this is for you. The characters are flawed -- each and every one of them -- just like me and you. I found the story uplifting in the sense that Garrick and Olivia are obviously soul mates and were destined to meet and be together. The meat and potatoes are the villains -- yes, plural -- who are as twisted and warped as they come. What Garrick and Olivia have to overcome to be together is way beyond what most people would do in the name of love. Theirs is a selfless love that is determined to conquer all evil so that they can be together."
5,brenda joyce does it again,"I have enjoyed all of her books, however, The Rival was exceptionally good, right up at the top of my list with the Conqueror and the Captive. I could not put down the book until I was finished. As usual, the relationship between the two main characters was extremely sensual. I loved it."
2,"I was very disappointed, Brenda Joyce is usually very good.","I felt this book was very boring. The subject matter was great! Yet, the book was to long for the subject and I actually skipped chapters just to finish the book. I was very disappointed because she is one of my favorite authors. This is not one of her best works."
2,Not Brenda Joyce's best effort...,"I have been an avid reader of Brenda Joyce's novels for a while. I was very disappointed by ""The Rival"". It started out great, but the characters were not really that interesting. Some of her earlier works were much better. I hope the next Brenda Joyce I read is much better, or I will be turning to other authors."
4,Really a 3 1/2,"Let me start off by saying that I am a HUGE fan of Ms. Joyce's deadly series. That being said, I found this to be an enjoyable book, but as one reviewer committed the book didn't seem to focus on the romance between the two characters (it did have some steamy parts though). However, the book was interesting and it kept me guessing."
3,Not really a romance!,"I got this book thinking that it would be a satisfying romantic read like Ms Joyce's previous novels, but was greatly disturbed.There is hardly any romance in it and the book is full of trials and tribulations faced by the hero and heroine.I love to read intense love stories, so I am not against the dark factor of this novel, only that there isn't much of a love story in this one.Still it was a pretty fast read, and so the 3 stars."
2,Not worth staying up all night!,"The characters were not drawn very well and after awhile I was just waiting for the next suprise to happen. Laslty, was it just me or did everyone seem to arrive at a destination within minutes of each other at record speed?"
1,Not the best of Brenda Joyce,I have been a fan for a long time. Have read all her books. I have been very disappointed in the last three. Hope Ms Joyce goes back to her former way of writing.
3,CMOS Imagers: From Phototransduction to Image Processing (Fundamental Theories of Physics),This book is mostly about vision applications and doesn't go into details of photodetectors physics ( PIN photodiodes is just mentioned) and also the computation of the noise of the analog front end ( no ocmputation of FPN and temporal noise). I also think the topics are not too much up-to-date with what industry is doing.
4,I eat it,"I really like this stuff. I try to keep it in the gum line but the flavor makes me want to eat it too fast...so I usually find myself eating it right out of the can. It has a really good flavor. This is really good for anyone that has a hard time chewing anything but loves the taste of beef jerky. I gave a can of it to a friend of mine unable to chew due to TMJ. I would highly recommend this to someone that can't chew due to TMJ, limited teeth ability to chew regular beef jerky, sensitive teeth or the like, or are like me and like the flavor. I eat a lot of beef jerky and this is a nice change once in awhile."
5,COMFORT PERSONIFIED,THE MOCS ARE AS COMFORTABLE AS I EVER OWNED AND THE SERVICE AND DELIVERY WAS FIRST CLASS. AMAZON CONTINUES TO DELIVER A 1 SERVICE
1,Poor Quality,The reason I say it has poor quality is I have had this product about six weeks and the inside bottom of the slipper is already starting to wear out. Get anything else but these!
5,Excellent buy,"I work with children and like to have music playing that they will enjoy and will also have help reinforce social values they are already learning. This album is wonderful. I haven't taken it to my classroom yet, but I'm sure it will be a hit."
5,Not what I expected!,"Pat Booth's new book ""Marry Me"" is not like her previous books.I expected it to contain adult contents. I am only half waythrough but I can't put it down. If only I had all the timein the world I could finish it in one sitting. It alwaysupsets me when I have to put it down.Definitly a page turner."
3,okay....,"This book has great visuals, though not really centered on Brown v. Board of Education like I'd hoped it would have been."
1,worse book ever,"The scariest thing about the book is how to send it back fast enough. It is clear that originality never entered any of the authors, would be, concepts. Unlike the master of popular magick, Crowley, this author has no appeal. Save your shipping cost. However, the book can be made to have a purpose, recyclable paper. The only reason for the one star is cause it can be use as the recyclable paper"
1,No more for me.,"Bamboo and Lace is not a bad book, I sincerely like the plot. However, as with all of Lori Wick's books, the characters are consistently unrealistic and tend to get a little boring. Apparently, no one in her books ever gets really mad or scared. And if they show ANY human emotion at all, immediately get on their knees to ask God's forgiveness. I will not be purchasing any more books by Lori Wick. Atleast not until she puts her characters in the real world."
1,Missed the boat,"Lori Wick is an amazingly talented author who I have enjoyed over the years. Unfortunately, I believe she missed the boat with Bamboo and Lace. I am extremely concerned with her lack of understanding about anger. We are allowed feelings of anger without guilt when our anger is displayed appropriately. I am appalled by Mrs. Wick's assertion that all anger is directed toward God. That simply is not Biblical. I have deep concerns about what this book says to new Christians. We all ""strive for perfection"" and we all fall short. Mrs. Wick needs to show the internal struggles that most of us battle with our emotions and our daily lives. None of us can live up to the model that is portrayed in Bamboo and Lace. How discouraging. And how much more powerful this book would have been had we been allowed to see more realistic characters fighting their daily battles, instead of cardboard Christian paperdoll people who never fail, and who have all their dreams come true."
1,VERY unrealistic.....,"This book is pretty much the worst book I've read in a long time. Ms.Wick's characters are completely unrealistic.... and don't go through real human emotions. Though Ms.Wick's books are usually unrealistic.... this one takes the cake! The characters are too ""good"" and too ""perfect"". The whole story is superficial and shallow. I wouldn't reccomend this piece to anyone...... don't waste your time."
2,Too Unrealistic,"What a disappointment! The characters in this book are just too one dimensional. Lilly was entirely too naive for a 24 year old. Had she never been to the US? I've visited the mission field in several countries and would like to know what sort of missionary never comes home on furlough for 24 years.I like happy endings, but this was too unreal throughout."
3,Typical Sugar and Spice,"Well, it's no surprise that Lori Wick's latest book is another ""heartwarming"" romance. In some ways it was a pleasant read...a blissful and unique Hawaii setting and a budding romance. Yet, this book has the typical ""laundry list"" of flaws-slow-moving plot, predictable ending, and too-good-to-be-true characters. Sure, we all like Lilly, the shy missionary's daughter, and Gabe, the ""hero"" of the story, but they just aren't convincing and real enough to make this truly a good read. Although I think this is a ""fun"" book, I certainly wasn't overly impressed with it."
4,I loved it!,"I have read everything Lori Wick has published and own most of them. I was given this book as a going away present when I moved over seas just one month ago. As I have dealt with adjusting to a new culture, I related to this book.I was disheartened by the lengthy negitive review I read, inspiring me to write my own.It is a fun and interesting romance. It is not a novel meant to be overly inlightening or life changing, just a joy to read. To Lori Wick's credit, it was a joy to read and I am glad I have it in my collection."
2,A bit boring and too predictable.,"I picked this book up in the library and read the back. I thought it would be an interesting plot. But it wasn't. I was disappointed at how slow the plot went. Ms.Wick made Lily's character too naive and too nice. The other characters (Bailey, Evan, Ashton, and Gabe) were all too goody goody. I also disliked Ms.Wick's writing style. It's way too confusing. (I don't know who's thinking what.) I did like how she contrasted the two cultures but it did not tell why Lily's father treated her the way he did. I did like how she finally stood up to her father at the end when he couldn't accept that she was in love with Gabe. Then the book really loses the steam it had after Gabe and Lily got married. But I did understand that Ms.Wick wanted to tell her readers how they do adoptions in Kashien. So I'm giving this book 2 stars because it had potential and there were some good parts in it. But all in all, it needs some tweaking."
3,Not one of her Best,"Well, I'd really been expecting more when I bought this book as it was a single novel like Sophie's Heart, which I loved. But this book was really lacking a lot of the ""stuff"" that makes a story enchanting. It is well-written, yet I think the plot could use some more work. It was rather long, and I felt the characters were somewhat undeveloped. Most of the story revolved around everyday life, and when there were interesting events, I think they could have been developed to a greater extent."
2,Where have our extras gone?,"While I am a huge fan of the Farscape series, I will not be buying any more of the DVDs until they start putting more goodies on them, or putting more episodes on them. The first 2 DVDs of this series were great: actor profiles, alternate commentary tracks, storyboards, photos. I just got number #4, and it had no commentary, and over half of the D'Argo profile was compiled from things we have seen in the previous DVDs! Aaarrgh!Other series are putting 3-6 episodes on each DVD, but we are paying the same price for only 2 episodes. Granted, the episodes are great, but that is no excuse to pilfer the pockets of the loyal fan base. Let sci-fi.com know that we want more goodies, and perhaps with enough feedback, we can get them. :)"
3,Where have all the extras gone...?,"Sounds like a song. While I do love these two episodes, with new planets, new characters, new aliens, the DVD itself has very little in it to be happy about. And with only TWO episodes, even at a normal, new price they cost too much. Now at the prices these USED DVDs are being sold for you have to ask yourself, is it worth it?"
2,what the??????,"I love the Farscape series, and it's not easy for me to see al the episodes on TV, so, when I saw the DVD I was realy happy, until I realised that the DVDs only contain 2 episodes each, at what I wouldn't call a cheap price. I'm realy mad, the other series I bought on DVD have a lot more episodes and better prices, so I'll wait and see if the price gets lower, but Henson is the greatests, as usual!!!"
5,Amazing vocalist; great songs for kids,Francine has an amazing voice and both kids and parents will love listening to this CD.
2,ok for hobby,had this wrench for six months and the strap broke. no made for work in a heavy truck maintenance shop
4,Good for clean rooms,This device has proven accurate enough to detect small contamination sources such as faulty exhaust systems and shedding garments in a class 100 clean room. I do warn you that a highly polluted environment might damage the meter. This has not happen to us yet but we have managed to have to send a contractors meter(of different brand) in for repair from testing air quality from an oven.Meter is straight forward and easy to use. Has a serial port hook up that can be used to collect data off the meter. Meter can hold multiple sample data sets. I have at least 200 reading stored on my meter. It also stores a time stamp which is useful if you forget what site the data is from.
3,Awesome art but...,"First off I have to say, I love the art in this book. The artists are extremely talented. However, the biggest beef I have with it is it is all in Black & White. Some of the images in it (especially those by Fastner & Larsen) have that look that they were originally color, but are now printed in Greyscale. That never does justice to the artwork. My suggestion to SQP is to print them in color. I would have gladly paid more for a color book. So, 5 stars for the content, 3 stars for it's presentation."
4,Good fiction but NOT history!,"I really love Monica Furlong's books, both Juniper and Wise Child. But her fantasy world is NOT the historical one. It has ties to early Ireland (before Christianity fully took hold), and so if it were historical it would be set before 1000 A.D. But Furlong introduces a witch-hunting inquisitor; the inquisition in the real world was only started in 1213, well after Christanity had taken over in Ireland. By the time that the witch-accusations start to be part of church activity (in the 1400s) no-one in Britain was admitting to the Old Religion. There are other touches that indicate that Furlong's fantasy world is not historical, but only the ones dealing with inter-religious conflicts are truly troubling-- because they may lead young people to have a inaccurate and possibly prejudiced view of the history of religion. (No, I'm not a Christian...)Anyway, the book itself is a great fantasy and I love it. It should just not be read as resembling real history."
5,"Amazingly done, a must have","I love this book. It is really phenomenal. Take a bow, Ms. Furlong! Anyone interested in witchcraft, magick, paganism or a well written story, you gotta read this."
3,Interesting and intriquing,"This book takes place during the era right after the time of King Arthur. It is all about a young girl who is abandoned by her mother, who is a witch of black magic. Her father is a sailor who is around hardly ever around. Her grandmother, who had taken care of her, fell ill and died. Then she is left without a home, and no body in the village wanted to take her in, except Juniper, who is an herbal doctor and a Dorian, a witch of white magic. Wise Child is the girl's name and she makes a home with Juniper, which has the whole village talking about how she is to be a witch too.This book is a good fantasy story, a little hard to follow at times, yet entrancing and hard to put down. Not only is it a good storyline, but the characters are really lovable. It leaves the reader spellbound and eager to find out what is going to happen next. All in all, this selection is very well-written and appropriately exciting."
5,If you could only own one book..............,"Then you would have to hold this one to your heart and have an all out debate with yourself it you could part with it. This story never gets old. No matter how many times you read it, there is always a phrase, a sentence, a moment where you are taken to another place and you feel love. Thank you Monica Furlong for such a gift."
5,Wise Child,"This is one of my all time favorite books for children or adults! Each time I read it, I am filled with peace, hope and a yearning for the simple, good life that Wise Child and Juniper share. The book, though not particularly long, is full of wonderfully well developed characters whom you come to care about. It is at once both adventurous and educational (it takes place in a 12th century Scottish village) and conveys a reminder of our inherent connection to each other, to nature and to the cosmos.Adults and children 10 years and older will love it - guaranteed!"
5,One of the Best,"I'm fourteen, and an extremely avid reader, and I read this book when I was eight, I think. To this day it remains one of my favorites. This book is about a young girl in Scotland, nicknamed ""Wise Child"" by her peers because of her big dark eyes. Her father is away at sea, her mother left when she was very young, and her grandmother dies. With no one who will take care of her, the one person who volunteers is ""Juniper"", the village doran(witch is a vulgar word). Wise Child is afraid because of the rumors about the young woman, but has no choice. Wise Child learns about herbs, ""spells"" and becoming part of the world. She also has some trouble with the village priest, Fillan, who believes Juniper is evil, and with her mother, a harmful Doran. I would recommend this to anyone of any age, for it's a classic tale of fantasy and frustrations."
5,"What I like to call a ""book""","There aren't any good books anymore; that's what I thought before Wise Child. This is my favorite book, it is so detailed that I could see the village and the white house in my mind.The book starts off excellent; explaining what is going on.It gets a tad slow at the very end, but I don't mind.The cover is so beautiful as well; because you can see Junipers kindness right there.Wise Child is great and I reccomend it for anyone!!!!!"
5,Wow!,"Usually, I am not a big fan of magic and fantasy books, save ""Wrinkle in Time"" or the Harry Potter books. But for some reason, when I started reading this book, I could not put it down. I had never heard of it before. I think Monica Furlong possesses a great talent for writing, and I am now hoping to track down a copy of ""Juniper"" to read. I really, really recommend it!"
5,Works like a charm,Got this to replace our OEM that had cracked with heat and age. Fit perfectly. Put it in place and it's like it's always been there.
5,perfect fit,"great product, fits perfectly, my old one was greasy and grimy and thought I had to just keep scrubbing it---but found a replacement was much easier."
3,Cheap plastic,"The lens works and is better than the original lens, it was close to 15 years old and kept cracking and disintegrating. The only con would be that it is rather cheaply made, but then, it does what I needed it to do."
3,juventud en extasis 2,"This is a really good book for teens and young adults. The book continues the story that efren and dhamar had a daughter citlalli and she goes threw alot of things as a teen.The book talks about,sex,marriage,hiv,dignity,relationships,masturbation,homosexuality,abortion and many other things.It also talks about morals,values and ethics. this book is not recomended for atheist because it conects even with the bible. Also the author is very direct in what he says sometimes sounds like his giving a sermon but thats one of the things of this author he does not cover things with flowers and bees he is straight to the point even if you dont like it. it makes you think and see things in a nother point of view."
3,Better than Sonic 3DBlast. I say a sequel to SMC is due,First of all this is more fun than finding flickies.The game is slow but its still cool to find keys its more like Mario than Sonic. I think they should rerelease all of Game Gears Sonic games onto a single disc and call it Sonic Mega Collection 2:Sonic Gear.
3,"A nice attempt at something different, but...","I praise the Game Gear at attempting 3D graphics. (It's more like isometric but whatever) It wasn't all for naught. This game is rather challenging. The bosses in this game are rather dull, (your only tactic: Spin Dash! You can't even jump!) but the levels themselves are okay. I'm suprised that this game has some Stereo Music, in a Game Gear! (go to the sound test with headphones, and you'll know what i'm talking about.) This game has some lasting appeal, with it's ""Time Attack"" feature. But this game, despite it being a spin-off, doesn't measure up to it's earlier entries.But on the plus side, it's not like ""the worst game ever"" like i've seen on other sites. It's okay. Mainly bought this game to add to my Sonic Game Gear collection."
5,Fantastic book!,"I found this book at the local library, read it through, and made a Potato loaf using the recipe in the book. The bread turned out perfectly, and all of the rest of the recipes seem to be of equal quality. I am purchasing this one as a permanent fixture next to my machine, and highly recommend it."
3,A good book for beginners,This is my first bread machine book. I have tried a few recipes. The brioche was not great but was acceptable. I have made the cinnamon raisin bread and homestyle white which are great.
1,Basic Recipie Did Not Work,"The cookbook gave many variations to the basic recipies and looked interesting.The ""Basic European White Bread"" was the first recipie I tried.The first time I didn't notice that there was not enough water shown for this recipie. Since my breadmachine can't be reset I got to throw out the batch (one hard lump and a bunch of liquid).I tried the recipie again and I did not make a mistake with the ingredients but the recipie is totally off. It needs about 2 cups instead of 1 cup, as shown.Glad I got the book at the library and didn't waste my money!"
1,Not really pleased,"The white bread recipes were good but, the cinnamon raisin bread laked flavor, it needed more cinnamon and the NY Deli Rye bread recipe has too much liquid."
1,Sucks,"This think makes it very hard to use the click wheel, and is damn near impossible to take off. i've been trying for an hour and only have it about 1 centimeter out of the case. don't buy this."
5,Caution: Book is Powerful!,"Schaller evaluates societal, political, and generational trends in relation to Christianity and contemporary ministry. His insights are inestimable. The wealth of information in this book is immense. Even if the reader disagrees with one or two of Schaller's numerous evaluations, theories, or predictions, the reader is still indebted to the author for sparking boatloads of novel thought. This book is best read slowly so that one's contemplative juices can churn and bubble into a rich froth. Caution: Book is Powerful!"
5,Honeymooners,"The Honeymooners is an all-time classic comedy about two families without kids living in a 1920-1940 style apartment building near New York. Somewhere in that time period. Although horribly outdated in many ways, this was/is THE comedy series of the 50's. Even after trying to modernize it, there is only so much ""cleaning"" of picture and sound qaulity that can be done sometimes. You get the idea. Do not let that discourage you though, for classic comedy in the black and white picture days, The Honeymooners IS IT!"
3,ummm not sure about this one,i guess in my mind i wasn't really grasping the idea of 1b i was very shocked the price i paid for this ! i could have purchased the same amount and the same quality at my local drugstore for less than half the price
4,Great service,Quality was great. Candy was fresh and in good condition. I needed whole pieces for my recipe and I got just that! Item arrived early and in plenty of time for my Thanksgiving goodies!
1,Where is it?,I still have not received this book. I am deeply troubled and unsatisfied because it is a textbook for one of my classes.
5,Very high quality,"This is deffinitely worth reading if you like B&W; photography.Because of favorible exchange rates, Americans can save money buying directly from the publisher's website rather than getting it from Amazon. As of 6/9/10, it cost $86 at the web site."
4,"Great job, Tina Wainscott!","I really liked Tina Wainscott's story, The Wrong Mr. Right. The other story, Never Say Never, was okay."
5,What a fun book!,"I really enjoyed both the stories in this book. I've read and liked Barbara Daly's other books. This Duets not only has a laugh-out-loud story from Ms. Daly, but also a funny-bone tickler from Tina Wainscott. I had a thoroughly enjoyable Sunday reading this Duets."
4,Comprehensive book on fascinating area.,"Absolutely fascinating book by well known mammalogist Tim Flannery. In the same series as ""The mammals of Australia"" by Strahan and ""Mammals of New Guinea"" by Tim Flannery, and equally as well laid out. Sections of the book are divided into families such as muridae (rats), phalangeridae (possums) and pteropodidae (fruit bats). Each species description includes a colour photograph, along with most available information on the species (many species are relatively unstudied. Overall, this book is a wonderful insight into the mammal fauna of this area, and I highly recommend it for any mammalogist or interested individual."
2,Disapointed!...,"Yeah there are outakes of ""I'd like to buy the world a coke"" but it amazes me that the whole commercial is'nt included in this dvd. And most of the ad's included are not the good ones."
5,Mandatory for Coke collectors.,It's the real thing. If you love Coca-Cola this is a must own. It has tons of great info on the history of Coke. Lots of old television ads and behind the scenes of the music. You will not be disappointed.
4,great for educational use,I use this in my classroom when discussing promotion. Excellent intro and something high school kids can relate to easily. Little dry like typical documentaries but interesting to students because of its notoriety.
4,Would I Like To Buy The Whole World A Coke?,"This DVD is great for any Coca Cola fan. It is full of interesting facts and takes us through the history of Coke. Did you know that Coke sent mobile bottling plants to Europe during the second world war? or that the coca cola bottle got its design from the seedpod of a coco plant? The DVD is made by the Coca Cola Company, So I do wonder if they had left out some of the negative details. This DVD is well made, and by the time you have finnished watching this DVD you'll be ready to by the whole world a Coke."
5,LETTERS FOR TOMORROW A JOURNAL FOR EXPECTANT,"This is my third pregancy and I have kept this journal with each of my children. It is great for your first or your 15th pregancy because each is different and so exciting that it is wonderful to have a record for them. The book is great in the way that it gives you topics and suggestions of things to write about and a place to put pictures of you your growing tummy. Sometimes a pregancy can become all you think about and this is a great outlet for so many feelings, hopes, worries - everything! It has been a wonderful journal and a terrific keep sake!"
4,All in one baby book and journal,"I used this book both as a journal and as a baby book. I took it to all of my baby showers to record gifts, even though it doesn't have an area for that purpose. I had my baby's grandparent write letters to him. This is something that will be treasured for a long time."
2,do not expect miracles,See my detailed review under cms 80gbabsplus - there is some fine print that needs to be understood or you will be disappointed... and you won't know until you try to recover.
1,Classic Rip Off!,DO NOT BUY THIS CD! These are not the original recording and sometimes not the original artists. Included are live versions by the original bands but done long after their prime. Some entertainment value but not at all what you remember.
5,Back to Good Music,"With her heart on her sleeve, Amy released a killer sophmore record. Just what we've been lacking. Old school, soul filled, GOOD music. You can't deny she has it. This EP with it's haunting ""Back to Black"" done the way a lovelorn love song should be done, is well worth the dough - and don't forget, you get a video of it too! Her cover of The Zutons ""Valerie"" is exceptional (why I bought the import in the first place / and better than the Mark Ronson version). I'd highly recommend if you are a true fan of this young, talented diva."
1,Ripped Off,"How does one pay 13.99 for is what is billed as an audio CD and have the entire CD consist of 3 tracks. Suffice to say, I will never buy another Amy Winehouse recording."
2,Mediocre Cabaret Singer with Outstanding Combo,"This singer's shrill voice and overdramatic renditions of such wonderful songs hardly seems fitting for a combo as talented as Bill Mays, Frank Vignola, Jon Burr and Joe Ascione. Conklin's voice is like a wet blanket on the instrumental performances and arrangements. I simply cannot understand how any organization would ever name her Jazz Vocalist of the year. If cabaret is your thing you might really love Mary Foster Conklin, but if you are looking for soulful female jazz artists pick up Dinah Washington, Nancy King, Billy Holiday or Nancy Wilson. Conklin is about as soulful as Dorris Day."
5,The Blueprint for High Tech Product Marketers,"I've been familiar with Geoffrey Moore's work since hearing him speak at a Cisco Systems Partner Summit in 1998. This field book is a must for anyone who wants to understand what to do (and not to do) to successfully market a high-tech product at each stage of the Technology Adoption Life Cycle, and during the Product Life Cycle. Reading this book has helped me better understand how and why we succeeded (and failed when we failed) at my previous company in the tech bubble of the 1990s. The challenge for managers and executives when reading this book is having the courage and fortitude to apply these principles, even when they seem counter-intuitive."
2,It is good book but...,"After reading the Moore's ""Crossing the Chasm"", this book really bored me. Maybe the language used in the book is the problem. I am not sure. However, I highly reccommend you to buy Moore's ""Crossing the Chasm"". It is an excellent book."
4,"Great, in-depth approach to vegetarianism","Rather than focus completely on a balanced diet, like many vegetarian related books do, the author paints an entire picture of the practical and ethical reasons to abstain from meat. There were facts upon facts, backed up with numerous research, as well as excellent responses to any and all comments or questions that meat eaters might have regarding the vegetarian life. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who is looking to know more about vegetarian living."
2,tin bucket,sounds like i'm drunk in a bathroom at a club. tin sound...no power and the remote has really spongy buttons that you have to dig your nails into to get it to function. No custom graphic equil'... too bad becasue it looks great and plays anything. I'll be takng this back and swapping it for one that look less but sounds better
1,Nothing about this works,"Straight out of the box, the remote doesn't work (some buttons do, but crucial ones don't--no matter how hard I dig my nail into them), it skips and stalls on a DVD that even my persnickety 6-year-old Sony player manages without a hitch (with the player isolated from speaker vibration), and the sound is atrocious (the other reviewer's description is apt). Even the radio reception is bad. Unpacking and setting this up was a regrettable waste of life."
1,Big let down,"I bought this item a few days ago, and have been very disappointed with nearly everything about it. First, the DVD player--the main selling point--doesn't work well; the disc reader skips every few seconds during movies (regardless of what kind of dvd). Second, the mp3 cd reader works, but again, not very well. I was able to get the reader to recognize a disc, but not consistently, and then not all of the ""chapters"" were readable (even though they were not protected files...). Finally, the radio is horrible; even with the antena fully extended I can barely get any reception. My alarm clock gets better reception than this thing! Although the price is attractive, you'd be wasting your money if you get this system. Look elsewhere unless you like collecting unusual doorstops."
2,Save your cash. . .,". . .and buy these songs individually. I had high hopes for this one, as Biz chooses some solid cuts on this disc. However, poor sound quality and uninspired chatter pollute what could have otherwise been an amazing work. Not worth the import price, or perhaps, any price at all."
4,Biz's D.J. skill's!,On the turntable describe's Biz Markie's turntable skill's.There are alot of old school break's on this disc.This is a good disc to just chill out to and reminisce.
4,Honeymooners - timeless entertainment,"I had never seen the Honeymooners until I met my husband. I thought black and white shows were sooo boring. Once introduced to the Honeymooners, I became a big fan. No actors (okay- very few actors) today can hold a candle to the talent of these characters. I love'em."
2,Only comes with Windows Vista,"I thougt I would try Windows Vista, but after just a few days I couldn't handle it any more. Toshiba does not support Windows XP drivers for this laptop. After i installed OpenSUSE 10.2 (linux) i found out that Windows Vista disables the LAN card when it shuts down! If you like Windows Vista this is a GREAT laptop, otherwise, get something else."
4,Desktop mis-casted as a laptop,"This laptop had all the features we wanted and more. The 17"" screen was more than we bargained for. It was huge! If you don't mine a deskstop feel and marginal battery life this is the laptop to get."
1,Don't walk - run from Toshiba,"The unit I bought spent more time in the repair depot than me using it.Today I sent it for repair for the 5th time in less than a year.You name a problem - it had it - faulty motherboard, hard drive, keyboard,motherboard again.Customer service is not better than computer - they refuse to exchange iteven after so many times being in repair.This is a plain stupidity from their part - the money they spent paingfor repair and shipping by far exceeds the computer cost.This will be the last Toshiba anything I bue."
1,Toshiba sux!,"This laptop started having problems a few months into owning it (webcam stopped working, etc etc). I tried to format to factory conditions using the provided recovery CDs. They didn't work. Toshiba Customer Service is non-existent: they won't help you! I've had Toshibas for years and liked them. Now they are awful machines. I will never buy Toshiba again. That's your warning!"
5,An excellent primer for all ages,"This pamphlet is directed to middle school students but is reviewed here as a basic primer for any needing to research and report on controversial issues. Students are taught how to choose and research an issue topic, how to locate the latest print, electronic and audiovisual materials on the topic, and how to credit sources. An excellent primer for all ages."
4,Judaism 101,"I couldn't wait for the 3rd installment of Suzanne Franks' series based on time travel and our heroine, Chloe Kingsley. Ms. Franks' wit is up to par with the other two books. I realized that I was trying to remember my bible and comparing the story of David with what I had read. I am glad that this time, Chloe and Cheftu had a more ""normal"" married life together. But I do want them to go on other adventures together in other time periods. How about the French Revolution? The possibilities are endless, as I am sure Ms Frank realizes what an audience she has captured. Please..may we have more?"
2,Incredibly sloppy research -- a surprise after books 1 & 2,"After galloping through books 1 and 2 of this series (true guilty pleasures) I couldn't wait and bought ""Mediterranean"" hardcover. I was quite unpleasantly surprised; the ""exquisite research"" seems to have gone by the board. Apparently it didn't occur to anyone in the writing and editorial process that corn, as in ""corn on the cob"" (page 22) is a NEW WORLD VEGETABLE. This is one we all learned in grade school. And bougainvillea (page 96) is a South American plant named for de Bougainville, 18th century French explorer. Okay, these are true howlers that nevertheless don't affect the plot. But the ignorance of the life cycle of the flea does. Fleas can't live on ""manna"" -- they live on BLOOD. Only.And the rapturous ""oh wow, this is the Bible"" got rather wearying.Final grade: books 1 and 2: 4 stars. Book 3...forget it."
2,Weakest in the series,"Ms. Frank's third installment of this trilogy is lacking in comparison to its counterparts Shadows on the Nile and Reflections of the Aegean. Sunrise on the Mediterranean is a very fast read, quite thin and way too predictable. I feel read the book more to discover the conclusion of the triology than for the story contained within the book itself. I expected more, I suppose, and I found myself disappointed."
2,Time Tunnel chapter 2525,If you are old enough to remember the TV show The Time Tunnel you will agree with me that this book is just one chapter of that program.
4,brake cable release tool,"great tool when it fits.... does not fit Chrysler concorde, od is too big and it fouls on the brake back plate housing"
5,THE NEXT GENERATION OF NFL STRENGTH TRAINING,"I PLAYED 11 YRS. IN THE NFL AND DIDN'T KNOW WHAT REAL TRAINING COULD DO FOR MY GAME, BUT ALONG CAME COACH ASANOVICH WITH HIT TRAINING THAT NOT ONLY MADE ME STRONGER BUT IT KEPT ME HEALTHY. COACH PHILBIN HAS THE ONLY SANCTIONING BODY TO CERTIFY THIS PHENOMENAL TRAINING.HIS BOOK IS THE AUTHORITY ON 'HIT' TRAINING,YOU OWE IT TO YOURSELF TO READ THIS BOOK AND TRY ALL THE PROTOCOLS. I GUARANTEE IF PERFORMED CORRECTLY YOU WILL ONLY TRAIN HIGH INTENSITY FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE."
3,Not a bad read,"This is an okay book. The idea behind it, doing more in less time by keeping the intensity high is an important one. The only issue I had with the book was exercise selection. It seems to be heavy on machine use, and while I understand that for HIT purposes, this is probably easier to implement, the purist in me wanted to see more basic movements using free weights."
3,Don't work for working out,"I was looking for headphones that would actually stay in my ears, especially while working out, and cancel noise since I always find myself having to jack up the volume at the gym. These cancel noise very well, as long as you're just sitting there. The first time I took these for a run, they make this terrible ""squish-squish"" noise in my ears. It was really loud, and I had a hard time listening to my music. I haven't worn them since--I'm back to the ones that came with my ipod."
1,avoid avoid avoid,avoid this companys earphones. the rubber tips fall off after a couple of weeks of use. inevitably you lose one without knowing and then they are useless.
2,EARPHONES,THIS WAS GOOD WHILE IT LASTED FOR 2 MONTHS AFTER THAT THE EARBUDS CAME OFF AND HAD TO THROW IT AWAYi NEED A NEW ONE NOW
1,broken twice!!,"the sound from these earphones is pretty good, but TWICE (two different pairs) the earphone bud broke. it just came apart. i bought these for $30 from my gym, and was pissed when they broke the first time after only a couple of months. after some fight, they finally gave me a new pair, and the SAME thing happened again. in my opinion, that is horrible quality and i would NEVER spend money on a product by this company again- definitely not any more earphones. buy at your own risk... they are only $9.99 now, so maybe it's worth it..."
1,Cstar CMOS Digital Color Eyepice for Telescopes,"My hopes were flying until I purchased this item. I noticed the resolution (0.3 megapixels - that's a ""0."" in front of the number) and started to worry. That worry was more than justified when I installed the software, hooked up the eye-piece and set up my laptop on a table outside. First I focused on Jupiter and its 4 largest moons using the optical eye-piece that came with my Meade Telestar NGC-60TC telescope. This particular telescope always gives good results with Jupiter and its largest moons as well as Saturn and its rings. Then I replaced the optical eyepiece with the digital eye-piece. Refocusing, very carefully, the best I could do was a blob of light for Jupiter and NO MOONS WHATEVER. I can imagine getting fair results looking at the moon, but for the price one expects a bit more than the moon when your interest is astronomy."
5,Finally I found something on the Krays,"For years I have wanted to read something on the Krays ever since the movie based on the brothers came out. This turned out to be very informative and entertaining read. Of course, every movie can't fit everything in that should be there. This book does that. A highly recommended book, one well worth the price."
5,priceless,"Nancy Dussault who has been on Broadway and sung the best of the best, has proven herself in her first Cd. Why did it take so long to come. She proves that she still has one of the finest voices on Broadway and should be there again. This CD has a little of everything new and old and should be in everyone's CD library."
1,Lexmark Dual Printer Cartridges,I have to return them. They have defective connectors therefore my printer does not print using these cartridges.
2,Good but not great,both black cartridges and one of the color cartridges were great. The second color cartridge did not work (not sure why but seemed to be dried out) but I still paid less than if I had purchased them locally.
3,Cheapest on Amazon,"This is the cheapest black/color combo I could find. It's $60 or more anywhere else. Quality is not too bad, as long as the printer is kept clean and dust-free. But still, price per print is too high, and don't expect to print out more than 4 or so 8x11 sized photos with the color cartridge before running out of ink. DPI for most fonts are surprisingly better than even some laser printers, and tables and graphs come out pretty good in color/b&w combos. Bit of a pain (in time/cost) in trying to align cartridges."
3,Semi-good choice,"Ordered a twin pack Lexmark 70 & 20 ink. The black works great, the color ran out already!!! After just 2 or 3 pages. That's NOT a good deal!!!"
5,lexmark,"the price was right. the color is greatwould recommend this product to everyone.still going strong, since I order it."
1,disappointed,"Well, here's the problem. I was very happy when my print cartridges came and I quickly installed the black one. I was, at first, very delighted because it worked just fine; but within about two weeks I started getting streaks through the print, which really surprised me because I don't use it all that often - just to copy an occasional email or make a greeting card. It seems the cartridge didn't have much ink in it. Ordinarily, a new black cartridge will last me at least three to four months. Disappointing.I can't rate the color one because I haven't installed it yet. My old one is still working just fine."
1,cheryl gillette/hills,"I was really excited to get this ink,as I was a new owner of a 3 in 1 machine...the ink cartridge didnt print well after the first 3 uses,,,its garbage,,but because its been over 30 days I cant get a replacement or new one....more money out my pocket I cant afford...I'm a single mom and these boys used this for their homework.now I have to save it to my computer,make a disk and hope my neighbors home to use hers....my neighbor lives 1 1/2 miles away as I live in the country...more gas money out the door and still no ink!"
5,Makes the connection between diet and health crystal clear,"Having studied Cayce and other nutritionists for years, this book has given me the motivation to FINALLY make the transition to a TRULY healthy diet. The book blends a well written narrative of Aajonus' curing his son - doomed to death by the medical establishment - with facts on the connections between food and specific illnesses. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for anyone trying to strengthen the intuitive wisdom of their body's own nutritional needs. Shows the links between processed foods, heated fats and sweets to our bodies' inability to allow the natural healing flow that is our birthright."
2,Crazy.,"Two stars because the book is entertaining, to me. I think that meat can potentially be eaten raw on a regular basis, if steps are taken to eliminate parasites and bad bacteria - fermentation, freezing for a day, etc.; however, this guy and his made-up name go way off the deep-end and he makes a bunch of claims that cannot be supported. And his learning to eat raw meat from a pack of wolves whom saved his life? Funny. Still, not a waste of time and I'm glad I'm one of the few who read this curiosity. Raw butter - great. Especially if from grass-fed cows. Raw honey - great. But mostly a lot of conjecture stated as fact. Moderation people. Beware of gurus!"
2,Unscientific and messy,"This book provides only anecdotes and results from Aajonus's personal experience. It contains very little useful information unless you're willing to completely trust Aajonus, though he provides little reason to do that either.Aajonus's second bookThe Recipe for Living Without Disease, on the other hand, provides verifiable reasons for choosing the Primal Diet, complete with citations of clinical studies."
3,One big issue,"Cons:1. One big issue. Attempting to actually clean the screens and fan blades of this model is futile. Once the screws are out of my old, now burnt out, Lasco twin fan model, you can easily clean the screens and fan blades. I had so much difficulty prying the screens (back and front covers) open I decided it was engineered to not be opened. Thus, after a few years the fans will be junk long before they burn out.Pros:1. Reversible with controls on both sides of the unit.2. Great airflow.Recommendation: I recommend a box fan, unless you don't have room, because you can mount a 20 x 20 filter on the back, using duct tape or installing u-brackets on the back so you can slip the filter into the brackets. These dual fan's are not so easy to adapt to a filter. The filter will significantly reduce the amount of dirt on your screens and fan blades so you only have to clean them every several years, plus it'll cut down on pollen, etc. in your room."
5,gets the job done,"even though i am a smoker, i hate when smoke lingers in the house. this fan can be used as an exhaust as well and fits perfectly in the window. now we turn it on every time we smoke and it makes a world of a difference. a great deal for the price."
2,"Very Basic, No Frills","You get what you pay for, maybe even a little less. As is frequently the case, since placing my order, I have since seen twin fans similar to this one at a similar price, with more features in local stores. Take note that there is no screen in this fan, so if you are NOT a fan of mosquitoes buzzing around your head at night, you might want to consider another, or figure out a way to squeeze a screen in between this one and the window. That's not easy because it protrudes beyond the window on the inside and out. The adjustable side screens are not very helpful. Yes, they block off the majority of the sides, but again, plenty of open holes for the mosquitoes. Bottom line, a little more time spent searching would have served me well..."
1,Didn't Last.,"Update:I initially gave this product an excellent review because it was working fine and doing the job.However,this fan only lasted about a month. Just stopped working for no reason. I kept this running even while it was raining because the motor is suppose to be resistant to water. Not sure if this was the reason why it stopped working, or if the motor just died on its own. I didn't even bother to call the company and just trashed it. Sure it is possible I received a defective unit, but I would pass on this one."
4,Works great...manually reversible,"This is a handy little fan. It's much less powerful than the 20x20 box fan I have, but is also half the size. I didn't read the reviews and didn't realize it was manually reversible. This means that there's on/off switches on each side of the fan, so if you manually flip the entire fan around to change if it's bringing air in vs. blowing air out, then you can control the speed or turn it off without flipping it back around. It's slightly handy, but not worth spending more money on this feature IMO because you could always just unplug a fan with an on/off switch on one side only to turn it off if you didn't want to remove it from the window."
4,Loud but works well,"After my last window fan died in a light rain, I needed to find a window fan with a water resistant motor, and this one had a great price. It works really good and has extensions on both sides of the fan so it can fit most windows without any problems. I even forgot to turn it off during a rain and it didn't burn out. (not that you should test this...)The only thing preventing this from being a 5 star product is the noise. This fan is by far the loudest fan I've ever owned."
1,Aweful,I purchased this Window Fan after reading all the review but I was surprised to see not to get any single air coming out from this fan. Spend your money somewhere else
1,Optimus fan,"After one week of use, one side , or one complete fan quit working. Opened it up and the right side fan was seized. i am not too pleased with this P.O.S."
3,window fan,"The fan is very light weight and I have doubts about its long-term durability. Also, the side fins don't quite reach all the way to the window frame, leaving a gap on one side."
1,The worst window fan I ever purchased,"When I received the fan I could tell by the packaging that someone elsehad returned it, they were smart!! The fan as 2 speeds not that it matters: somehow the fan manages not to blow air into the room. Made in China."
3,My Dad loves it.,"I gave this guide to my Dad who is crazy about Vegas. He already have one, dated 1994, which got very old. Myself, I personally think of Fodor's guide that they're too arid, with few or none pictures. I think they're boring and dull, but my Dad says they're great. I think he's just gambling."
3,Its an ok buy but...,"I actually bought this gun from eBay but i wanted to put up a review on here too to let people know how it is. First of all the price is fairly good for a casual use gun. The weight and feel of it is pretty realistic, but after a week or so, the hammer got jammed into its pulled-back place. I can pull the hammer back farther but it will not go forward into its regular position and the trigger is also stuck along with the hammer. I've tried taking it apart to fix an internal component that seems to be loose but i can not get the gun fully apart because of the slide which is pinned into place.I'm not going to say don't get this gun because it is not like my problem will happen to everyone but I will say be cautious of what you buy.Overall, this pistol is really nice for playing with your friends or target practice and I would give it 4.5 stars if mine didn't break."
5,Le Chateau Women's watch,"have already sent my review for this product, but since you have asked for it again i will repeat it; I am using this watch and am very happy with it.Thank you again"
3,"probably good quality, but tiny","This is probably a watch of excellent quality, but for $50 it is VERY tiny. My fault, I should have really checked the watch's diameter before purchasing."
1,sorry we bought this,Our son got this yesterday for Christmas. Worked for about 10 minutes. We recharged - though no instructions included -had to research on the Internet to find 8-10 hours to charge for 5-10 minutes of run time. Today it does not turn on and does not run. Very disappointed in this product. Less than one day and it is broken. Instruction booklet not helpful or informative.
2,cheaply made.,"you get what you pay for, I thought I could have fun with my kids for a while, three weeks is all they lasted, I bought three of them, not at the same time, the first one I bought runs but with twitchy steering, a week later, I bought the second and third, the steering servos went out, plus on one of them the ESC completely gave out."
1,3 Minutes,"My son got this car for his 12th birthday. he waited 3 days for it to arrive, waited for the recommended 10 hour initial charge time. We put it together and it ran for about 3 minutes before catching on fire. Now it won't work at all."
4,Good Value,Can't beat it for the price. Very durable and almost ready to go right out of the box. Battery life isn't the greatest but recharges relatively quick. Recommend a second battery for more continuous fun...
2,Second one stopped working after 2 weeks!,"The first car I got did not work. There was something wrong with the transmission between the vehicle and the remote control. But thanks to the quick response from Amazon I had a new set up in about a week. The new one works great, and I have had a ton of fun. The battery doesn't last too long, probably because the thing goes so fast and it's fun to just let it do cookies in one spot. I bought an extra 1400n battery and it lasts longer. Update 2-23-10, The second one stopped working. Transmission between transmitter and vehicle I believe. I want another one, but Amazon won't let me have one. Go figure. I guess they are saving me from myself."
1,Unusable.,"Assembled the truck, turned it on, and was totally unable to trim throttle. Maybe too much interference. I'm between an airport and a large hospital with a helicopter pad. Wheels spin at full speed (25+ mph). I put it down once and it ZIPPED out of sight faster than I could follow. Had to pull it out of the bushes, still whirring at full throttle. I've tried repeatedly to reach the manufacturer but they won't answer e-mails and I've given up with customer support after 30+ minutes on hold, twice. This thing has potential to seriously rock, if it'd work. Maybe I'll try it in a more secluded area. It's been sitting on the shelf since the one time I tried to use it though... Total bummer!"
3,Mediocre,"I have had several variations of this vehicle. They were marketed and sold by radio shack as Propulse RC several years back. I have had four of these vehicles and two of the four have been good. Most recently, I ordered from Amazon and the product came from TampaHobby.com. The remote control was defective and I called megatech (who has changed their name to high definition RC) as the package insert says "" don't return to store, call us"". Anyway, High definition RC was horrible....they basically told me that I needed to call the store where purchased (even though their insert says to call them). Bob, from Tampa Hobby was extremely helpful and is sending a replacement transmitter to me at no cost. So, I cannot highly recommend megapro vehicles, but would highly recommend TampaHobby.com as they have been unconditionally supportive and helpful in this situation."
1,Outdated,Anyone sitting for the CPA exams needs to get the most current curriculum available. Never buy anything after July of the year published without an offer for online updates. Anything less is risking failure. IE audit was estimated to have changed 40% since 2008 was published in January. Imaging getting this two years late.
2,Insufficient,"I expected a game theory textbook, and found far far less. There are many case studies which are barely relevant, and the theorems and equations are not laid out clearly. There are far better books out there on game theory, with greater depth, breadth, and clarity. There is nothing which I found this book to have superior to others. It has taught me to be wiser in considering my purchases."
5,Be prepared!,I wanted to try the different assortment of fragrances and was completely surprised at the response I received. The gold one has a smooth clean musk scent. All the women in the office kept saying how wonderful the fragrance was. Other customers in the elevator stopped me too. The orange one is my second favorite with a spicy scent. You cannot beat the price or the complements you will receive.
4,Playboy,This was a good product and was as advertised. Good buying experience and would make another purchase. I am happy with service.
4,Nice and smooth,This is probably up there with Odessy no.5 except that i think they did a much more professional job on Odessy no.5. If you're into alternative you really need this for your collection though.
3,Powderfinger are Good musicians,"Powderfinger are a good band. The Stand-outs are, ""The Day you come"", ""Passenger"", ""Don't Wanna be Left out"", ""Celebrity Head"" and ""Over my Head"". This is worth it's money but nothing more."
5,Internationally awsome!,"I had never heard of Powderfinger until arriving in Australia, and after hearing Internationalist a few times, I couldn't understand why! Powderfinger is one of the hottest Australian bands on the market. ""internationalist"" is a good mix of slow and fast songs, providing a wide variety of songs to listen to."
4,one out of three,"works ok with puzzle quest, thats it so far. has a thin cord and heavy reel.with some games no controller is good enough, so keep that in mind.doesnt seem to matter the time period of the game, but simpler is better for usethe case is a great way to keep it and packaging is excellent."
2,"Cute, but broken out of the box","Cute, but device manager kept throwing it into unknowm devices even after installing the driversTried it on Windows 7, Windows Vista, and Windows XP - same issueIt is very lightweight and feels cheap, I am sure that if I had gotten one that was not broken I would have used it for portability purposes... since it was so cheap I have not bothered with a return.Buyers beware"
4,Portable Perfection,"I bought this because I wanted a small, portable, easy to set up controller to play games, mostly NES emulators and the like while I work 3rd shift at a very boring and dull job, and for that purpose, it is the best 10-15 bucks I've spent in awhile, it's quick in and quick out. if you have a more permanent setup in mind, though, I would go with a more ergonomic controller like the PS3 or Xbox 360 for windows setups."
3,You get what you pay for,"Cheap, Cheap, Cheap. Not the greatest, but not a waste of money either. Very, Very small. My 5yr old loves it."
3,mini foldable pc pad,great for what it is. not good for fighting games so dont even think about it. for people with big hands this gamepad is impossible. its way too small so you'll have trouble holding it in position when accuracy counts. if your thinking a good gamepad for portable situations then just use a ps3(with driver)controller or xbox360 controller. not exactly wireless xept for packing.
3,x,"Chord too short and wire pathetically thin. The turbo and clear buttons are not standard joystick buttons, meaning you'd have to use the companies' software to interact with them instead of being able to configure them in-game or in-program. It spans from the base of my hand to the base of my fingers. Would give 5 star if it was 10 bucks."
3,Good for RPG's only,"I've bought the gamepad thinking it would be the greatest thing in the world. Well it was hyped up in pc gamer. It delivers only half way, it sure beats playing on the the netbook keyboard. I use it for emulators, but the response of the analog pad sucks in action games. I've tried it on nba jam a few times and I won some but it was a constant fight with the controller to respond how I want it to. I have big hands but not fat fingers thankfully otherwise this would be completely unusable. I still recommend it for playing rpg's especially on plane flights but be ready for the bad controls in action games.Also doesn't look very well built so we'll see how long it lasts. There is no mention of any kind of warranty anywhere on the packaging so it looks like a cheap throw away toy. Which it is, small and very easy to pack in the laptop case."
4,"Great little pad, may be too small for some.","I have large hands so my hands cramp with extended use. Other than that, awesome pad for travel, comes with a nice case and a retractable usb cord which has decent length. I use it for zses on my laptop and it works as advertised. Minimal setup."
3,"Like most ear buds, they don't fit well","I wish the Samsung Sync didn't require a proprietary plug for the headphone/headset plug. It made it very hard to find something that would fit. So, I got the Samsung model made for the phone and yes, it works fine. But like every other type of ear bud I've tried, they just don't fit very well. Either they're too loose and feel like they're about to fall out (which makes the sound not so great for music - not necessarily so bad for conversations as long as you're in a quiet place, like the car with the windows up and the radio off), or I have to jam them in to get a snug fit and that hurts too much to leave them in for any length of time.Having said all of that, for the price (about $10 on sale from Amazon), I can live with them...but if I was going to use them a lot, well, I wouldn't."
4,Good buy for the price,"Well, i just received this product in the mail after 16 days of waiting. I bought this product for the price it was available for ($5.99+) from a seller named igonemobile. Music from the earbuds are very clear. I just think that the earbuds are a bit too big, they can only be made to sit in your earlobes, some people like to have it all the way in. The package may say 809, which was originally intended for Samsung SGH-809 but works fine with Samsung Sync A707. Except for the delay in shipping, i don't have any complaints about the product, atleast for now."
2,Questionable longevity,"I got one of these a few days after they came out. Initially it worked fine, but its performance has slowly degraded over time with it taking longer and longer to respond to menu choices and button clicks. Now it randomly decides it won't play discs or will abort in the middle of playing! Warranty repair is expensive - keep your receipt."
2,This DVD player is a disappointment,"I bought this player because it was supposed to be better at playing DVD+/-R/RWs, etc. It does do that except it refuses to read DL disks. The other reason I bought it is because of its HDMI connectivity and HD upscale feature. I haven't been able to get it to upscale any disks yet. There is an indicator on the front panel that says when its in HD mode. Light hasn't gone on yet. The other issue is sometimes the unit only buzzes (!!!) in response to pressing any remote button. Eventually it responds normally to remote inputs. I am disappointed with this unit in general and I'm thinking about hooking up my old DVD player again. (An older Sony 5 disk changer). I'm usually a diehard Sony buyer but I think this one is not ready for prime time."
1,Horrible device,Bought this item in 2007 and after 1 yr it stoped working. Would not play any DVD/CD. Kept giving an error msg saying loading. Contacted the manufacturer they would not honor the warranty. DO NOT BUY ANY SONY DVD PLAYER. TRASH
4,works great,Picture is great and works great -- only thing is I did have a disc get stuck one and had to take the cover off to get it out!
1,Stay away from Sony!!!!!,"I bought this DVD changer in October '07 and by July '08 it has started to die as described in other reviews. It takes forever to change chapters, it won't play legitimate disks I have recorded from tv, and it even refuses to play some store bought concert DVDs dropping back to the menu after a five minute stall. I refuse to have another Sony product in my home from this day on. There was a time Sony meant quality, but this is a heap of excrement! Add to that what Sony has done to people's computers with their copy protection malwear, I would say they are the lowest form of business out there and should be avoided at all costs!"
3,almost there,"I bought this DVD player a couple weeks ago and have been marginally satisfied with it's performance. It's since been rendered obsolete with my purchase of a PS3, but here are my thoughts:Pros:- sturdy construction- plays wellCons:- slow to start up.- none of the buttons are backlit, making use in the dark tough.- numbering on the disc carousel is black on black so it's tough to tell what number a particular disc is.- remote is ugly gray color (was hoping for black like other Sony products.)All in all, I give the product 3 stars. Some finishing touches by Sony would have made this a much more user friendly player."
1,LOOK BEFORE YOU LEAP!,"This player has a major flaw. If you're like me, you were probably hoping to use this unit to replace both a cd player and dvd player. However, this player won't allow you to shuffle discs. You can shuffle tracks on an individual cd, but that's it. If I knew how retarded this player was I would have gone with something else. What's the point of the carousal? Now I have to have two large components if I want shuffle play, or sell this one and buy something else. Sony really dropped the ball on this one."
2,What's the point of 5-disc capacity if it won't shuffle between discs?,"Audio and video are great, but it won't randomly shuffle between discs. If you're playing a CD, it will randomize the tracks on one disc but won't move on to another disc until all tracks of the first are played."
1,OK but not long-lived,"This is the ultimate in planned obsolescence. These are SLOW and eventually will fail to load even a new DVD. The unit will display ""Loading"" ad infinitum. (Yes, I've cleaned the lens)Used to be that you bought a piece of electronic gear and it would last for three years or more. I have a Pioneer 60"" Projection TV that is running fine after 10 years. On the other hand, I've been through three of these players. At the price, DVD players are just about disposable and that is what I'd call this unit.Two units I purchased lasted only 3 months and the third one about six. Covered by warranty you say? Well, who wants to wait weeks to have the unit repaired or replaced? SONY is not the company they used to be. Never another."
1,Worked OK until the tray LOCKED,This was my 4th Sony 5 disk player. If worked fine until I got LOCKED and the tray would not eject. Nothing on the Sony web site or suggested solutions from other sites would unlock the tray. My 10 year old Sony electronics still work fine but everything of theirs I have purchased recently has become worthless within months.
1,Purchase a sledgehammer at the same time - you'll need it,"Purchased this 10/10/06 and it refuses to play any disc as of 10/9/07. The player has been well maintained and cleaned. Played well long enough to go past the warranty (funny, that). I'd rather pay more and have some decent longevity than buy one every year. I'll never buy Sony for dvd again."
4,Nice Unit,"Nice unit. Works great out of the box. The DVD upconvert feature works GREAT on my HDTV -- no options, it simply scales it to fill the screen.The Amazon listing is a bit confusing, since the customer-supplied image shows an HDMI cable. The unit does NOT include a cable, so be sure to purchase one."
4,So-so DVD changer from Sony.,"This is a pretty average DVD player. It does what it's supposed to and has some smart features, but at the same time, its performance is sub-par at this price range, in my opinion.Pros:1. Sleek design.2. You can keep watching one DVD while loading/removing others.3. It resumes the playback from the spot you stopped, even after the unit has been turned off (up to 6 discs).4. Pushing 'PLAY' on remote will turn on the unit.5. I was able to play back most of the disc formats advertised (haven't tried them all) without any issues.6. Intuitive navigation through pretty comprehensive menu.Cons:1. Slow disc load time.2. Weak 'COAXIAL' audio output.3. Not the greatest picture quality. (Using the component connection, I actually got worse picture than from my 4-year old $30 Memorex player. HDMI connection improved the picture only slightly).4. As with any other changers, has big footprint.5. Front panel display is somewhat dim."
4,Couldn't ask for more from a DVD player,"I was shopping for a HiDef player, but couldn't afford one so I read about some DVD players that upconverts conventional DVDs on HiDef televisions.Found this one and I sure wasn't disappointed at all. The picture quality on my LCD was very clear and clean. Almost comparable to a HiDef player. On close-ups, you can see the imperfections on skin and the strands of hair. The 5 disc changer also didn't hurt either.I'm glad that I went ahead with this player. I'll probably stick with this until one of those HD players go down in price. Then again, why spend more money when this works just as well?"
4,Electronics Man Review....,"I really think that all of you need to check this dvd player out, i just received mine the other day, but some great features to highlight, you have a 5 disc changer to play with, for 50 dollars more mind you compared to 1 disc. One other thing, I have a sony 50 inch hdtv and also a home audio system, listed on here as well. Its just awesome, using the cheapest cables for Component cables you can still notice a huge difference. One thing i would encourage all of you to do is to buy some HDMI cables, buy the cheapest you can find either online or in the store, doesn't matter what type of hdmi cables they all are the same. Don't let anyone fool you. Everything with sony also is standard for remote use so you'll be able to use all your sony stuff for one remote. Kudos to all sony employee's thanks! I encourage you to try this for yourself, but get it if you have everything else, if you want something simple this isn't good for you."
4,works very nice,"I am very happy with the dvd player, but one problem I do have is the fact that in the title you put SACD, but in sony's website it lists this player as not able to play DVDA and SACD. Besides that im happy"
5,Fine value,"This is a really fine product. Minutes to set up, flawless reproduction, seamless performance. I'm not sure what the reviewer above me meant by it doesn't do SACD though he/she might be right about it not being in the manual. SACD will play in a great many DVD players with optical (as the Sony has) or co-ax digital audio out. I've had this player five hours and have not been able to stump it with a format or a less than stellar condition DVD.I typically am not impressed with Sony products in general, but this is an excellent unit. Well worth the money."
3,OK but oither on label,OK but listen for yourself.I got because I like some label mates but this was only so so acid jazz meets downbeat Thievery Corp stuff.Not essential but if you need something to rotate on the nightshift it's OM.Chazz
4,Knight Templar (alias The Avenging Saint),"If you already have The Avenging Saint, don't get this book. The publisher just changed the book's name and cover.You may want to read ""The Last Hero"" before reading this book in order to really understand the background of this story.The story starts with Simon Templar returning to England to revenge the death of a friend. Revenge isn't easy if every member of Scotland Yard is trying to arrest you for murder and other crimes. Simon soon learns he is the only person who can stop a major European war. Can Simon bash the villians, stop their war, and avoid arrest? Not quite; he only manages to achieve two of these objectives."
4,It has a tone of seriousness in its subject.,"I liked the book for being different from the normal Saint stories. The plot is wide and it makes you think. The Saint plays a more thoughtful role in this story as he can't make a false move. He knows that he is the only one who knows anything about a coming war and he is the only one who can stop it. Actually, that's what I liked about this book. The Saint didn't do anything remotely rash in this book."
4,Fits well but doesn't really help with wind,I cant really tell the difference with this or without it. i have half doors and so much wind comes in the sides that i don't even notice this stopping any wind. Feels well made though.
4,"""So far, I still know who are...""","What a great song this is. One of the Pumpkin's strongest. Wistful, moving, urgent, gentle and sentimental all at the same time. A sweet song about parting ways, moving on and wishing the best for each other. What a great message!"
4,Very good,"The Brooks Revelation Pacer running shorts are good quality. The liner, waist drawband, and shell are all well made. For under $25, I think they are a great deal. My only complaint (and it is minor) is that they could be a bit longer. Overall though, I am very pleased, and would recommend them.Written by Arthur Bradley, author of ""Process of Elimination"" - an action packed martial arts thriller."
4,Fake Bake Self-Tanning Lotion,"Fake Bake Self-Tanning Lotion, 6-OuncesI liike this product - it does give a nice tan - be very careful and use gloves. It's messy to use."
2,Not the best,"I've tried countless tanners since I was a sophomore in high school because I'm naturally light skinned. Not too fair, but not dark enough for my liking. I tried Fake Bake's lotion and mousse, and neither exceeded my expectations. The tanner didn't apply as nicely as I would have liked. The mousse, however, gave me instant color. Neither lasted more than a couple days, even with moisturizing twice a day. Definitely better tanners out there."
1,not worth the money,"This book describes how a lock works with a couple of diagrams and how to open them in the shortest amount of time by only trying useful combinations : it's not because the dial goes to 40 that there are 40 choices, usually about 10 ""gates"". most locks combinations are low number-high number-low number or high-low-high, etcThese rules will let you make a list of combinations to try so that you find the right one as fast as possible.All this could fit in a web page (and probably does). I don't think it's worth the price."
1,Not really very useful,"If you want a book that tells you how to open combination padlocks, just like in the movies... this is not it...This book tells you how to halve (maybe) the number of combinations that will open the lock. There is really nothing worth reading in this book. It narrows down the number of combinations, then you have to try them... one by one.This book teaches you how to open locks, but youll never get any better, every time you open one, it Will take half an hour.My suggestion, try a different book."
4,"Not well-written, but otherwise perfect","The writing style is clumsy and sometimes annoying, but the content is pure gold. I used the instructions it gives to open my first combination lock (my brother had lost the combination) within an hour of opening the book. The next two locks took 35 minutes each. Not very difficult at all."
4,No Frills - Just The Facts,"When looking for <a href=""http://www.lock-picking-books.com"">lock picking books</a>, this one is very informative. It will give one great ideas on opening padlocks, but the language is very basic, no frills here. This is not a romance novel, it's how to open locks without keys, and that's it. You will learn what you need to here. But you should always seek out more knowledge."
4,Old System Gaming Fun,"This is a really fun game if you're into the game Tetris. Hats arrive on a conveyor belt, and you must drop them down onto heads. You must get a stack of matching hats for them to clear. Occasionally, you get an option to discard hats from the bottom up, and also from time to time you get an option to switch the order of heads; so if you have a big stack in the middle, you can move it to the outside. This sounds simple, but when the hats begin to mix, they can really pile up, and if you go past a certain height, you lose. This is a game I can play for a long while - not as long as the time I spend playing Tetris, but still a pretty good stretch. I was amazed and pleased to find this item, not many people have even heard of it. I recommend this highly if you have an old working NES system."
5,There is a second edition now,"The second edition, under a revised title, Winston & Kuhn's Herbal Therapy and Supplements: A Scientific and Traditional Approach is available, with more monographs and updated research. This Amazon listing isn't clear that it is the first and not second edition."
1,Forget it!,"If you don't want to struggle trying to pull your product out of this horrible mold, don't buy it. I tried to do some chocolate lollipops for Valentine's day and I finished with confetti. Not worth the expense. Bad product at least not for chocolate. Maybe someone used it for another candy and it may have worked but not for chocolate, at least not o me."
2,they do the job...a few times,"not a bad product, does what it says...for a while. I prefer the white ones from the NEX/PX stores on base as the snaps are rubber that doesnt detach from the strip. These have plastic snaps that after a few wears will fall out of their holding and you are left with no attachement piece. I would recommend the two front, two back (which are overkill) for something which will last."
1,Great for Disposable!,"I got these in the mail and was more than pleased on my first wear. They kept my shirt tucked in and me looking nice. But the truth is that these are only good for one time use. They are disposable.After one use, the thread that holds one of the clips is coming lose. Obviously I'm not going to find out when it is going to break.I looked good for one 8-hour work day. Now it's time to give my money to a company that can make a quality shirt stay. Anyone know where I can get that?"
2,quality not quantity,"I have all the dvd's released to date. I love them all. Laugh out loud funny. I am disappointed in the quality of the dvd. It's similar to an old 10mm reel.True Honeymooner fan that i am, I must own them, there is still nothing funnier."
4,New York Yankees pinstripe MLB Replica Jersey,"I found the jersey to be in excellent condition and as pictured on the website, however, I felt that the quality of the material was slightly less than I had expected."
4,Interesting Book,"This book started off a little slow. It took a couple of days before I really got into in. But once I reached the middle of the book, I couldn't put it down. Even though it was somewhat slow, I had to order ""In Cahootz"" just so I could see how Tukey finished what she started."
4,Takes Urban Reading a Step Further to Success,"This book truly keeps you on your toes. Tukey was a true Hustler's wife and proved loyalty until Keith pulled the ultimate betrayal. If it had not been for her uncle would Tukey had took such drastic measures of revenge? A true ride or die chick, Tukey gained trust in Keith by giving up years of her life to protect him. Then to be betrayed by him. She was still on his side even after that until a shocking revelation. This book was on point. I can't believe this was Quentin Carter's first novel. It can only get better."
3,Pussy will get ya hoodwinked!,"Hoodwinked? YES!!!This is another tale of hustlin' and what the crack game can get you. Good & bad. Kevin & Keith are a team of two young brothers making so much money that the people around them are watching closer then they could ever imagine. With money, comes bitches and with bitches came plots. After taking one downfall after another, this story takes some twisted turns and the outcome will have you saying DAMN! Behind every hood rich dude, is a bitch that made him one! Unfortunately the men in this story didn't appreciate a down ass chick when they had one. Revenge at its finest!I gave this book three stars, it wasn't bad it was just wasn't GREAT. After a slow start & some grammar errors, it had some hot juicy intimate scenes & good ending."
4,Pay Back's (...),"This book was full of drama and suspense. I was hurt about Kevin, and Keith got what he deserved. Tukey was definitely a ride or die chick, and Selina needed her butt whooped. Tee had me suspicious from the gate, and Uncle Ben could have went out better than that. Over all the story was very intertaining and made me want to keep reading."
3,Glad I picked it up,"I liked this book, this was my first Quentin Carter book and I enjoyed it. His writting style reminds me of Al Saadiq Banks. I was mostly caught up in the Tukey and Keith relationship, cause I am a love story girl frist and foremost so the male/female relationshis is ways my first connection. I wouldn't have expected Keith to be so grimey. I mean I could see him slowy falling off from Tukey and migrating to Selina, but I mean he just dropped her like hot grease. I couldn't wait for the part two In Cahootz to come out. You'll have to go to In Cahootz to see my review for that book. All in all this book made for a good read."
4,Hoodwinked,This book was great is was well written and you got a feel for the characters. I would definitely recommend to those who like urban novels. This author did a very good job.
4,Name fits perfectly,"I liked Hoodwinked. I read it in 2 1/2 days, I even snuck to read it at work. I respect the author for writing such a good read while incarcerated, especiall since its his 1st book. Not too many typos and thats a plus for me! SEX scenes great, another plus for me. Keith annoys me thru out the whole book. I do like Kevin though. I give Tukey points for riding thru thickand thin with Keith, but u cant do that unless the other person is riding also. People seem to think that money IS everthing and its not.However, love is and when u love someone u should cherish that. That is why I give Tukey points. That b**ch Selina, is a whore!! It was never about love with her, she just wanted her bed to rock. She is one of the biggest homewreckers ever! I definitely recommend this to anyone who liked True to the Game, Shiesty, Cream, and ALL Triple Crown books cause its another page turner."
4,great work shoes,"I have been very pleased with the support these shoes offer. I work 12 hour shifts, on my feet most of that time and my back and hips are no longer hurting me. I bought these for my sister as well and she feels the same. I would highly recommend them."
2,Poorly done,Is it just me or is Anastasia supposed to be a little younger? Every single person on this recording sounds like an elderly person. And there is no orchestra. It's all piano. It's all operatic. No stand-out songs. No power voices. Very disappointed.
1,White man wants to be Indian,He's taken sacred text and made money on it. Not good medicine for him or his horse.
4,great,i like it but i had purchase the extendeder wht ever you call that thing that goes in between the the wall ...well it dint fit with tthis product so now im trying to figure out how to make it work for now i have to still keep getting up to open the door for my baby dunken my dog....lol...
3,jerry,"The door was the right size to replace our old door. However, it was hard to install as it was tru a outside wall."
5,Built for funtionality,"It is easily installed, it seals well, built with a solid structure, so very easy to insert and remove door."
4,Pet door.,"This is a great looking door. It's made for a thick outside type door, so if you install it on an interior, thin door as I did it will need to be shimmed w/ blocks and looks alittle crude on that side. Howerever this is no fault to the design. A handy type could make a frame to make it look better, I just chose not to. We use ours to the basement where the catbox is. If you have a fat assed cat like us, do not get any smaller model than this."
4,O.K. but not as good as before,"I bought one of these several years ago,this one is not as good, made of plastic instead of aluminum, the magnet is not near as strong so bugs can get in, also 1/2 inch shorter in height but advertized the same as the old one, , may not sound like much but my doggies have more trouble, I still have the old one on another door, and still working great.."
3,XL Pet door review,"The frame and size are adequate;however, it is not as sturdy as the old one we had that finally wore out. The wind can easily blow this one open as the bottom is not very heavy. I would rather had a door of heavier material."
4,Pet Door Works Well but...,This pet door works well and is made well but not as easy to install on inside doors with panels. There is not enough thickness. With some adjustments we got it to fit and work. We like the way the flap works as not to hit the cat.
5,The only pet door I use for my cats!,"We have multiple cats and only this one is as easy yo install and versatile as it is. I put one of these in a sliding vent window using extended screws, and it works brilliantly - it isn't too tall or short.Whenever I need another door, I look for this one."
4,"Very interesting, but not much fun","I hate to be the odd man out when reviewing this book, but here goes. There is a huge amount of info here, which is both fascinating as well as frustrating. You can't see the forest for the trees. It simply isn't easy to read, or to get to the bottom line. Hundreds of acronyms, while obviously required, help to create the feeling of a college textbook. The numerous photos are wonderful, but all except for 8 1/2 pages are in black and white. Bummer. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad I bought it, and learned many things, but found it tedious to get through."
5,THE Shuttle book,"If you can only have one book on the Space Shuttle, this should be it. It has everything from the X-15 through the development of the Shuttle, has summaries of every proposal throughout development that exists (and says which ones vanished.) It even has lists of the serial numbers of every main engine and booster that flew on each mission!Don't panic if it all seems over your head, despite being so technical, the text is very engaging and easy to understand...most people probably skip those serial number lists on pp. 332-342 anyway."
2,Too Small For Huntsman Knife,"This is a well made nice leather pouch, but it is too small for The Huntsman Boy Scout Knife I purchased for my Grandson.Disappointing!"
3,So-So Medium Swiss Army Knife Pouch From Victorinox,"I bought a couple of these pouches and a larger one from the vendor's web site. The box said Victorinox, but the pouch label and quality said Made in China. The medium pouch will hold, say, a Victorinox Pioneer Harvestor or Electrician model. One of the pouches had trouble staying closed with a knife in it. There is nothing special about either the material, workmanship or design. If you can live without the barely visible Victorinox cross on the flap, you can find better, more attractive choices in a knife sheath from other manufacturers."

2,just not what it used to be,"it works OK, but it's not nearly as good as the one I got several years back.smaller, less dense wood, and the ridges are shallower and not as ""ridgey.""I'd probably give it another star if it weren't for my expectations - the original was a 5 star item."
5,This is for your foot?,I was not aware this was for your foot. i have been using it with my boyfriend and we have never thought of it as a device for your foot. but me and him are still giving it 5 stars because it still makes us say wow! :-D
4,Not perfect,The things I didn't like about this product was the fact that the rubber rings at the end came off after using it for the first few minutes. I finally just left them off since I couldn't get them to stay in place.Also I think I need a stationary roller as it would slide to much and I would have to reposition it too often for it to be relaxing.Things I liked about it were the fact the wood was solid and the massage felt great until it rolled too far.
2,Not so great.,This has not been that useful to me. I would not advise anyone to buy this if they are looking for a foot massager. There are definitely better things to use out there.
5,Love this butter dish!,"This butter dish is perfect for the fat butter sticks. I haven't tried putting two sticks in it I buy the ""Lurpak"" butter or an Irish butter that I get at my local grocery, and this is perfect for it. I love the pattern and the ceramic is very high quality."
4,"Product is great, but service from sender was iffy.","We have found that we quite like the Mink Oil Spray for our Newfie, as well as for our shepherd. Our only complaint on this product would be that the first shipment of it went to some place in New York state (which was extremely inconvenient and not very effective for us). When I tracked the order, however, and discovered this state of affairs I immediately alerted Amazon and, thereby, the seller, and they shipped another bottle ASAP.When we finally did receive the product, we were extremely pleased with its effect on the dogs' hair and were pleased as well with its very pleasant fragrance. Some folks said that it seemed to repel ticks, though the manufacturers never made that claim. We haven't found it serves as a repellant. It is an excellent product for exactly the purposes it is sold to address. All is good."
3,Good But Be Careful,"This product works wonders, but don't use it on a double coated breed when thier coat is still wet. It does great on a dry coat."
2,boring,"living through the 60's and 70's was more interesting than reading about it in this book. If you are interested in reading about it, get the book from the library and save your money. That is my opinion. Kaatja Wright"
2,Coating comes off rack,"After about the third time using this rack for roasting chickens, the black coating started coming off the rack (and onto the chicken). It does have a warranty but I did not return it and as I had bought it while traveling it wasn't feasible to return it to the store (Williams Somona in San Francisco). Both the lg & small size racks had the same problem. I purchased them about 4 yrs ago. Too bad - useful item."
5,This rack is huge!,This is a sturdy roasting rack and very practical because it comes apart for storage. I sent mine back though because it was too big for my uses. As the description says it accommodates a 25# turkey... and even more I'm sure. I could not downgrade it just because it was too big as most things tend to be smaller than they claim and this one is very well constructed.
5,Real Views,"A lot of writers dance around this issue. This book gives insight on how a lot of people feel and why they feel the way that they do. Black men and women have issues with one another as well as conflict, however this books shows both men and women that they need to work on HEALING the rift between them. This book also EMBRACES interracial relationships and prepares the reader for the TRUTH which is that we are headed toward an integrated society. This book is progressive as well as hard core. The kid gloves are off when it comes to racism, the author explains that we are all in search of the same thing which is happiness. He explains throughout that racism is a tool to keep everyone divided and distracted from the true problem in the country which is economics. I think after reading this and hearing what the author says, the healing can begin. This book was on point!"
5,"The Honeymooners Lost Episodes, we bought them all!","The Honeymooners Lost Episodes, Vol. 7 has ""A Little Man Who Wasn't There"", ""Goodnight Sweet Prince"", ""Ralph's Diet"" and a bonus feature ""Gleason's Honeybloopers."" The bonus starts with jokes from his ""Jackie Gleason Show"" and ""bloopers"" during live television and how they tried to keep the story going as they covered up their mistakes. The bonus also has snippets from a few Honeymooners shows and includes an episode with Ralph & Ed on ""Beat the Clock"". My husband and I started purchasing each DVD, but found that it was much easier to buy boxed sets. We purchase all the ""lost"" episodes available after we had purchased the ""Original 39"" which some think are the best, however you will find the same great humor among the ""lost"" episodes. I was very glad that AMAZON offered these. We have bought many items through AMAZON, and we have never been disappointed!"
5,Good Textbook,Purchased this for a computer science course since it was required. Great price at Amazon!
1,Hard,"Even though the topics of this book are absolutely great and crucial for any CS student, I dislike the entire book !, its hard to follow the writer, i find it hard to keep with him !too many complicated information with either Tiny explaination or more complicated explaination ,its a very big book with many topics , i prefer reading seperate books with specific topics rather than this book,"
5,It's useful of my computer organization course good^^,"Its a excellent book of computer system,its also help me to complete my homework that about ""Cache Simulator"".And i suggest you reading this book together with the operating system concept 6th.A programmer perspective is good for the practice.no confusing words , no aberration , no complicated description, its my review. that is all"
2,Not for beginners,"My department makes us read this book alongside an intro C Programming guide and it is PAINFUL.Avoid, unless you already know what you are dealing with."
1,Good for 5 sheets of paper....,"Pros:Was able to print the alignment page and four additional pages.Cons:Was only able to print a total of 5 pages, when attempting to print a sixth page the printer stopped half way through and displayed a ""Cartridge Error"" message. Tried all the trouble shooting steps provided on the HP website for the error, nothing worked. I was really hoping this cartridge would work, so I wouldn't have to pay full price for the HP cartridges.The paper that came with the cartridge stated that for a warranty replacement you would have to pay shipping fees - the fees and the hassle of returning wouldn't be worth it, I would end up paying twice the original amount."
1,Awful cartridge. You are getting what you are paying for...,"It simply doesn't print... You cannot see a single printed letter - I was truly disappointed with this purchase and just reminded myself that you are getting what you are paying for. Therefore, now I am heading to Staples to buy an original HP cartridge - at least you can print with it and I have never ever had any problems with it. Moreover, thinking about cartridge refills or remanufactured cartridges- if only it is not technologically inferior or doesn't guarantee the print quality - why it should cost a half or even 1/3 of the price for a normal cartridge - not 80% or 90% of it?"
2,Got what I paid for,I never write reviews on products but was sufficiently disappointed to write one in this case. The cartridge worked for perhaps a week or two and then the ink light starting flashing and all hope was lost. I am trying another brand of remanufactured cartridges to see if I have any better luck.
2,low quality control; ink ran out fast,"I ordered one. It came fair quick, but the top of the cartridge is not sealed evenly. So it does not fit into the printer properly. I got a replacement fairly soon. However, it lasted less than 4 months with very light printing. At first, the print comes out very dark, like bold print, even I set to ""fast draft"". So ink ran out quick within less than 4 months."
3,Great while it lasted,"Recieved the product and it worked great. A few months later (not used very often) the printer (HP) displays "" right cartridge error"" and will not operate with this cartridge. The cartridge still has plenty of ink. If I install an old HP cartridge the printer wil operate."
5,Awesome and cheap!,This cartridge works fine and is crazy inexpensive. I am a Prime member so free shipping and the cost of this cartridge was way worth it. I would have spent that much on gas going to get one of these.
3,First one didn't work,"The first one that was sent to me didn't work. My printer wouldn't even recognize the cartridge. I already knew there was a chance it wouldn't work right, so I am okay with that. After contacting the seller they sent me a replacement and an envelope to send the one that didn't work back to them. The second one worked perfectly, it worked right away, and didn't print fuzzy like they sometimes do. I'd recommend this, but only if you are willing to contact the seller when they don't work, because sometimes that happens."
2,Ink Easily Runs If Paper Gets Wet!!,Ink Easily Runs If Paper Gets Wet!! This is not the good stuff. The original ink does not easily run when the paper gets wet. Be aware!! Cannot read anything if the paper gets wet.
3,needed to be replaced they did,needed to be replaced they did. these products work some times with my printer and some times they do not. I am a firm believer now of buying ink and doing it my self.
1,"Ahhhh, should have believed the reviews!","Yep, people weren't kidding. After a few sheets were printer, the cartridge error mentioned here so many times happened. But hey, for $5 you might get lucky."
1,Says by HP but this is made by FOCUS,"See the same product by Focus. This is NOT made by HP and is not a high quality product. It has a high rate of defects. Mine was NOT RECOGNIZED BY my HP Officejet. It worked a few times and that's it. Waste of money and time. My Officejet displays ""Remove and Check Black Cartridge"", which I have done multiple times with no success."
2,When it prints it is ok,I kicked around even giving this item 2 stars when it prints it is OK. However HP has to be wise to these guys because the printer will shut down with an error message almost after every print job sometimes in the middle of it.......... Then you have to fiddle with your printer to get rid of the error message before you can print again. Bummer!
1,Crap shoot at best and this one did not work,"I have bought these remanufactured cartridges before with good results but this one did not work at all. Buying these is a crap shoot. But at least it was only around $5.00, so it's worth it when they work. (And the last 8 I bought were fine).Even when they work be advised that they don't have as much ink in them as a regular name brand cartridge"
1,Horrible quality from day one,"I purchased this ink cartridge in August, knowing I'd have a back-up when needed. I did finally need it, installed it this past weekend (beginning of December 2012), since then it has only printed with lots of lines, like the ink is dry. The quality is atrocious. I opened a claim to return it through Amazon citing these concerns, and the response was that I'm out of my time frame for a return (which is true). Very disappointed."
1,Ran out ink after 2 uses,"Purchased this cartridge before and it was great, lasted a long time. However, the last 2 black ink cartridges have given me nothing but issues. Printer doesn't recognize it, ink is low, etc. Won't be buying again."
1,Don't buy,These remanufactured cartridges suck. They don't give you either the performance or life of the brand name cartridges and that is so sad because the printer manufacturers make their money selling you ink cartridges. If the remanufactured cartridges were as good they would save folks a lot of money.
1,Don't waste your money!!,"After receiving my order of two ink cartridges I sent an email to the company because I was having a problem with the one cartridge. They sent me an email on how to ""fix"" the problem myself instead of immediately sending a replacement cartridge. I followed the instructions and got the cartridge to work properly. I kept a record of how many copies I made since I don't use my printer much. The cartridge didn't work after the 16th copy. Not sure about the other cartridge because I've only made a few copies with that one on my other printer. I emailed the company and here is their reply.Hi,Unfortunately since your purchase is past our warranty, we are unable to directly provide you with a replacement/refund. We regret any inconvenience that this may have caused you.Thank you,The E-z Ink Team"
2,"Not accurate, waste of money","1) It attaches to the wall using 2 way sticky tape/compound and is too heavy for the weak tape to keep it attached, resulting in it falling off the wall and hitting the ground.2) Even if it stayed attached to the wall, the laser wont be accurate because it doesn't attach firmly and flatly to the wall.3) You can only display the laser from left to right, and not right to left, because if you flip it over and lay it down on the CH side, the laser will not be straight (even though the bubble inside says it should be level).4) Stud finder is inconsistent, at least with my textured walls.I want to return it but not sure if Amazon will take it back, or if it would even be worth it with the price of return shipping. Do yourself a favor and get another laser level/stud finder."
3,3.5 stars - a great airplane book.,"While not a great work of literature, Ford has written another very exciting, suspenseful story. However, I wish there had more character development building of Frank, who seemed almost secondary in this book, and was put off by a credential attributed to the reporter. There were some relevant social statements made but, overall, it was a story high action and a real page-turner, but without much to stay with you at the end of the story."
5,I enjoyed everyone,"I started with his first books and have now read everyone. I do recommend starting with the first as the characters develop and refer to earlier matters. Fun, easy read, well written. I only wish he had written even more."
2,"Plausibility takes a vacation, violence works overtime","I liked most of the eight GM Ford books already on kindle, and this last one looked promising.However, I only made it 20% of the way in. Then it became clear that graphic violence and implausible actions were the rule, and I wasn't in the mood for popping eyeballs and dopey, greedy Federal agents. Characters are either good or bad. I should have listened to my friends who warned me to stick with the earlier, gentler and funnier books by Ford."
3,Average. This book was OK but I wouldn't read it twice.,"I wasn't sure about this novel before picking it up, but it sounded interesting, so I decided to give it a go. I'm glad I did. This novel was suspense from beginning to end, with a few clever twists thrown in for good measure. The story highlights that, no matter how secure we may think a facility is, there will always be a need for vigilance. The characters are well-rounded and demonstrate that, while convicts have made some wrong choices and may be dangerous men (and women) who need to be incarcerated for the safety of society, the majority are not completely evil. We all have some good inside us somewhere (though admittedly buried deep in some people). This is definitely worth taking a look."
4,Entertaining,fast paced and good character building. Waiting for him to put out more novels. His other series is equally as good about the Private investigator in Seattle.
3,"Interesting, but Flawed","An older piece (actually quite old by now), it shows its age. It's an okay beginning read if you're interested in the early T'ang or the Empress Wu, but not all C.P. Fitzgerald's conclusions have held up to historical scrutiny. Best for the casual reader interested in the story, not the serious student of history."
4,Dare to be succulent!,"I am stretching and daring others to be succulent. I am waiting for a chance to go and stand naked in the rain. Way to go Sark! We, in Minnesota, are proud to claim you as our own! I hired a house cleaner, went out to lunch by myself while my house was being cleaned, and read this wonderful book of Sark's! Now that is succulent. Women...we deserve to be succulent. Start your journey now towards succulence. The word even sounds succulent! Say it outloud!"
3,"sark, we get the point: you like taking naps","I've read most of SARK's books and found that she tends to repeat herself within a book and between books......so, once you've read ONE of her books, you need to read no more.....they say the same thing in different words and different pictures."
1,Not as Advertised!,"Advertised as Type M but is actually Type M+. M+ cards will not work in some older cameras. Make sure your camera is compatible with Type M+ cards before ordering! This card worked in my camera for about 5 minutes then died, returning."
5,Good price on a 2GB XD card,"I bought this to go along with a digital picture frame, and it works just as promised. Plenty of storage for my pics, fast access, conveniently small."
5,Great product!,These cards where bought for our Olympus Camedia C-60 zoom. They work great. Always remember when erasing your cards to format them.
4,Great Item,Ordered item just a few days before my trip to Vegas. Item arrived as ordered and works just fine in my camera.
2,Worst ever!,"It is not that it really sucks, but it didn't worked, was faulty. I cannot say that all this XD cards are faulty, but at least mine didn't worked."
5,""" Deeply insightful, refreshingly open and candid!""","Men, we have to read this book! No, Not just read it, feel it,as it speaks enormous volumes to our very souls.True inspiration in its purest form can be gained whileprovoking thought and a healthy dialogue.If you have ever wanted a look into the mind.......no, ""The Soul of a Black Woman,""take a good long peek, it's more than worth the read!"
5,FROM A WHISPER TO A SHOUT!!!!,"AMEN!!!!, HALLELUJAH!!!!, RIGHT ON!!!!, YOU GO GIRL!!!!!,ETC. AFTER READING THIS HEART WRENCHING DOWN HOME SOUL SEARCHING BOOK I HAD TO SHOUT!! BECAUSE I CAN RELATE TO SOME OF THE THINGS SHE WENT THROUGH AND HOW SHE SURVIVED. CAME OUT SMELLING LIKE A ""HONEYSUCKLE ROSE"". THIS BOOK SHOULD BE ON THE BEST SELLER LIST. I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ALL SISTERS. KEEP ON WRITING. I CAN HARDLY WAIT FOR THE NEXT ONE. AIN'T NO STOPPING US KNOW, WE ARE ON THE MOVE. THANKS SO MUCH. GOD BLESS AND GOOD LUCK.********** 10 STARS."
3,Wish I Liked It...,"as well as the Face Oasis Moisturizer. It is a good cleanser, gentle but effective. The issue is that it is very watery. I know it is called cleansing ""water,"" but I didn't expect it to fall out of my hands literally like water. I had a hard time getting it from my hand to face. I figured out that it's better to put it in your cupped hand, put it on your face, then add water. That said, it is a little complicated for a no-fuss morning routine for me. It also seems to go fast, however, the bottle that I have is only four ounces since it came with a gift set. Perhaps the full size will last several months. Nice cleanser, I just think the formula could be less watery, thereby reducing the amount you have to use each time."
1,Burns easily and the coating peeled after a few months use.,"This was a big disappointment. We use it indoors on an electric stove, so we have good control over the temperature. We use it mainly to make quasadillas (sp?), a dry, medium temp process. Even so, we found it heated very unevenly and would often burn in spots. After a few months, the coating started to peel away, so it is useless for food preperation. Don't waste your money. I wish I could get mine back."
1,very disappointed,"It's a great size-BUT...The bottom is warping as it is being used, the non stick material it is coated with is peeling with each use. What a hunk of junk!!!!!!"
1,What a great addition to the BBQ... but...,"This pan is a WONDERFUL addition to the BBQ. We do our veggies in the Deep Dish Griddle. My wife and I love 'em!Add seasoning, a little spice, and some olive oil; toss the veggies. Put them in the pan and cover with foil. Put the whole thing on the grill on high. Ten minutes later, take the foil off. For the next twenty minutes, while the other stuff cooks, move the veggies around every four or five minutes with a PLASTIC spatula. The amount of oil you use will determine the crispness of the veggies.After a week of use, the non-stick coating will have mostly peeled off. Then you have to buy another pan. That's the down side."
2,Gary Null's Red Stuff,"I received no benefit from this product. I think that the capsules are better than the powder though, because the Red Stuff powder does not mix well when you stir it."
4,Raw Hard Rock,"I would have never, and I mean never heard of this band if it weren't for that big ol' book, 'The Encyclopedia Of Heavy Metal'. They were included in that book, so I managed to find a used copy somwhere and I bought it. It's real hard rock, the way it was meant to be played. It's raw, ratty, and in-your-face. I don't understand why they only released this one album. It's a lot better than Led Zeppelin, and that band acheived so much success. This is a real 70's underground classic."
3,This band had promise...,"I heard of Granicus while thumbing through the book THE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF HEAVY METAL, and of course my instincts kicked in to find this album. Any band who gets compared to Rush and Deep Purple is good enough for me to scope! Having said that, the album really isn't all that bad. It definitely has a dated quality to it which adds SOME charm but the mellow tracks need to go. Woody Leffel's voice is on fire here!! Yeah there's traces of Geddy Lee, Ian Gillan, and Robert Plant in there and I dig that. My favourite tunes are ""Cleveland Ohio"", ""You're In America"", and ""Paradise"". I agree with the one review that says Axl Rose must've heard this album sometime ago, because I can hear some of those nasally moments that Axl used in ""Welcome to the Jungle"". I only gave it 3 stars because it's a DECENT album, not great. If this band were given the time to stretch out, I can only imagine what they would've come up with next..."
3,The game was great.,The Darkstalkers fighting each other in the opening credits is really cool. Too bad you don't get much of that here.Only features a handful of the Darkstalkers.Only sort of left me wanting more.
3,It is a good book.,"It is about a funny camping trip. My favorite part is when Amelia Bedelia goes boating, and takes all the boats with her. I am seven years old."
4,Lots of Fun,I got this book for my 6yr old granddaughter. She loves it. We take her camping with us and she is already reading books like this. I would recommend the Amelia Bedelia books for reading fun for this age group.
5,Timely and insightful,"Kevin Ring delivers the goods in this excellent book. Ring brings Scalia to life with wit and a deep understanding of the Constitution. You don't have to be a lawyer to enjoy this book! Makes the often mysterious intricacies of the Supreme Court understandable and accessible. With the Supreme Court on the front pages, this is an excellent time to buy this book and read it."
5,SCALIA DISSENTS,Love this book. I find I need to check my law dictionaryto be sure I understand some things.Scalia writes so beautifully.
2,A critical review of Justice Scalia,I've been fascinated by Justice Scalia's opinions and written dissents over the years. This book confirms my belief that most observers of the Court have concluded they cna deduce how Justice Scalia will vote 99% of the time--pro big business and anti-minority. As far as writing dissents. he's had plenty of practice.
1,"Antonin Scalia: the enemy within, hiding in plain sight","The subtitle of this book might be more appropriately worded to read thusly: ""Writings of the Supreme Court's Worthless, Most Outrageous Justice."" After reading his dissents, I can only conclude that Justice Scalia is an enemy of the United States, hiding in plain sight on the land's highest court.The man needs to be removed from the court and put into a mental institution."
1,"Scalia's great, but this book isn't worth it","I am a HUGE Scalia fan and agree with him on most constitutional and statutory questions, in addition to loving his sense of humor and wit. But for the life of me, I can't imagine why anybody would want to spend money on this book. The book is simply a handful of truncated Scalia opinions without the majority opinions to which he's responding.All of these opinions can be accessed for free in their COMPLETE form from any number of legal websites (such as FindLaw, for instance). More importantly, those websites, unlike Ring's book, include the majority and concurring opinions in those cases, giving the reader at least the option of seeing what Scalia's opposition actually wrote."
2,Great imagination but poor execution,"I just finished reviewing 'Lemon' by Lawrence Krauser and I have to say these two books strike me in much the same way. Great imagination by both authors, I admire the originality but once again the writing was a draw-back. I saw a lot in 'Carnivore Diet' that I almost wanted to re-write myself because I felt like it was begging for that. Whereas in 'Lemon' the writing was over-blown poetic babble, the minimalist approach employed here actually hurts the humor. At least that's how I see it. The idea about the chagwa laying waste to Washington was hilarious as was many other parts but I kept getting the feeling that this was a first draft and with a little more description the jokes would be funnier."
3,It does the job as it seems.,"It is as wide as I expected and has a contemporary look. It tips over when stands alone so I have to lean it to the wall or chair. Otherwise, it does its job. I got 2 of them and keep them both."
4,Contemporary magazine rack with lots of room,"This magazine rack is very sturdy and has quite a bit of space to hold both magazines and books. With all the space and no divider, skinny magazines seem to curl up on the bottom unless you have a lot of them to create bulk. Overall a very nice looking rack."
1,Cheaply made product,Rack arrived with one of the small ball-shaped feet broken off. Very poor craftsmanship. I am very disappointed. Otherwise it looked very nice.
3,recent purchase,Haven't had time to read it yet but the book arrived quickly and in a very good state! Thank you!
3,AS GREAT AS THIS EDITION IS....,"...in terms of the scholarly approach to editing, maintaining as much of the original ""feel"" as possible, etc, the precis given does not specify that this edition does not have the original illustrations or ""illumination"" that accompanies other editions. The text is, as the annotator claims, complete, but it only has a dozen or so of the illustrations, and then only as an appendix in the back. For me, this means a 1-star penalty in my review."
3,For obsessives only,"It's good to see an affordable edition of this ""classic""--'cause it's not that good, unless you REALLY like all things vampiric. Meandering, incoherent, self-contradictory, and lacking characterization, but fun for occasional dips into the pool of blood. Buy it. Why not? Just don't expect Dracula or anything."
3,so bad it's good,"it's so bad that the writer forgets the names of some of the characters, or he forgets the events of previous chapters, or he is forgets certain characters all together for chapters. but that doesn't mean that its not a good story. it has many bad points, such as being long winded or the books title-varney! really!- but it is a good story. and the notes are very helpful in explaining what the writer seems to have forgotten and getting a great idea as to the origins of the modern vampire vs. the old vampires. i would say that this was a really good buy."
5,why did it have to end,"I very much enjoyed this book. The victorian style creates a great atmosphere for the antics of a vampire who wins the readers sympathy even as he drains his female victims. The editors notes are at the bottom of the pages for easy reference, like having a friend reading with you. Thank you Curt for such a good presentation of must read vampire fiction."
1,Uncovering the real Watchtower,"This book is a must read for any student of the Bible. If you really want to see a unique slant on the word of God then don't miss this one. This organization has been talking about the end of this system of things for well over a hundred years. Although they will deny any such thing. Their latest that 1975 would see the end of this system. Just one of their many statements to that effect was in a 1967 Kingdom Ministry where they said ""Just think brothers only 90 months left until the end of this system of things"" Read it using your own bible and break through the bars of a real cult."
3,Don't rely on this book alone!,"This book has most everything you will need.HOWEVER,Base your study around the objectives listed at lpi.org and not from the book!I knew all the nutshell test 1 info inside and out. the only problem is there is info on test one that nutshell saves for test two.I guess the best advice is to know both tests inside and out before taking either one."
3,"A Good Study Guide For LPIC Exams, Although You May Not Need it!","I purchased this book for preparing LPIC exams and then passed the exams. But I found out that from the official LPI website (www.lpi.org), it lists all the detailed objectives for the exams. Which are more updated than this book. Basically you only need to have one comprehensive Linux book and then follow all the objectives to prepare the exams. By doing that, it should be no problem to pass. By the way, LPI just upated its objectives which will be effective by April, 2009. So I expected new version of this book will come out very soon..."
2,The book is nice but outdated,"The book is structured really good, the problem is that is outdated for the current LPI objectives. It would be nice an updated edition."
4,"Buy This Book, but get experience as well.","Lets make this clear if you haven't memorized all man commands yet then you definately need to buy this book. I totally agree with other reviewers here that this book is an invaluable reference guide to any sysadmin working on the job.I have found that this book has gotten me through LPI 101 and 102 exams. I did not get a high score though. On the exams itself you do need another reference.....The best one I have found is Past experience. The LPI is a great certification because the questions that they will ask you will come from left field. But you will need this book to pass it and it will make you a better sysadmin!If you are a geek and can figure things out then grab this book, read it twice and Pass the LPI. I got my current job purely off LPI certification So my advice is get it!"
5,The best book availabe in the market,Just came back after becoming an LPIC. I have tried all the books out there on the subject. It s sad that this is the only good book available on LPI 2. The author is undoubtedly very strong in Linux and is very knowledgeable. In fact I found this book very helpful in explaining many topics which other general Linux books overlook. Dont be fooled by one book covering part 101 and part 102. Topics are coverd in depth.
3,It's good but,"I am returning it, the copy I got was published in 2006, so it doesn't cover current topics for LPIC 1 and 2."
2,Bad For a Beginning,"I got interested in Linux a year ago and i consider my self a beginer. This book was written for someone how workes with Linux for two or three years tips for taking the LPI exam. This book is not the best for begginers at all. In addition, many topics are out of date.The topics are poorly organized ( for bigginers again ) have to read some information in page 200 to understand page 20. i don't recommend this book for any beginner."
5,Good book for exam and work,"I pass exam 101 with 20 minutes to spare. I study the review questions, doing the exercise, doing the demo test, and restudy again. Note: remember to study variation of the demo test. Example, if demo test ask you ps -aux, you study pstree. I hope this comments help."
2,Needs update badly,"Like many of the O'Reilley titles, this book has become dated and is much less useful than it might be. This book needs to be updated to reflect changes in the LPI exam since it's publication.This book is oriented to the first edition of the LPI exam. That exam has been history for quite some time--is there any plan to update this book?Another problem with this book is it's over-wordy style. You have to work to extract the desired information, and if you're trying to prep for a challenging cert exam that is probably not what you want to spend your time doing. The Exam-Cram books, for example, are much more tightly focused on helping you pass the exam.All in all, your money is best spent elsewhere."
1,waste of money,"I ordered one of these, though not through amazon. same as the other reveiwer it just keeps going off. my poor dog cant even move without it going off. I have given up and taken it off. guess I'll have to try something else"
1,"Viatek Bark Collar- SAVE YOUR MONEY, DOESN'T WORK.","This is a worthless thing to PAY for. My dog ignored the beeping and the ultrasonic part.....only the dog knows if that works, obviously not !"
5,Excellent latch hook,"I bought this lighthouse kit a few years ago to make for my mother. She loves lighthouses. I worked on it in between taking calls at a busy call center. It still looks beautiful. Whenever I visit her and see it, I'm surprised that I actually made it. I'm not the most creative person in the world. The color coding was easy and it's something we will cherish for many years to come. The finished product looks exactly like this picture."
1,The Wrong Sunnydale High,"This is a terrible joke of a movie. The dialogue is laughably false. The music is either corny or maddening (if you've ever wanted a beating heart to drive you insane, this is the movie to do it for you). The generically pretty boys take their shirts off a lot, and two of them even take awkward showers that leave much to the imagination and seem to be replayed over and over again (like a lot of the action in the film, actually). This movie features a make-out session that is embarrassing for both the audience and the participants. The cheesy music would be laughable if it weren't so terribly sad. If you feel like punishing yourself with the worst moving images imaginable, watch this film."
2,Journeymanlike,"This is not Schulman's best work. Unfortunately he has never really come up to the standards set by his first novel, Alongside Night. This book is readable, but not great."
1,Not worth the time,"Here's the card:Owen Hart vs. Savio VegaHey, it's Owen, so it's watchable.The Smokin' Gunns vs. The New Rockers vs. The Bodydonnas vs. The GodwinnsWow was this boring.British Bulldog vs. Psycho SidHorrible match capped off with the best power bomb I've ever seen.Marc Mero vs. GoldustSee, Goldust isn't funny here at all. And neither is Mero.Jake Roberts vs. Jerry LawlerWhere do you even start with this one?For those who don't know the story here, get Beyond the Mat right now.Undertaker vs. MankindThis is the boiler room brawl. Mick Foley takes some sick bumps, and this is a pretty important match in the style sense, but it's pretty slow. I actually thought the booking was pretty cool though.Vader vs. Shawn MichealsThis was a huge dissapointment. I was expecting this one to save the show a la Halloween Havoc '93. But no. Sure it's a good match but why bother when the rest of the tape is so worthless?In short, don't bother with this one. There are plenty of better tapes out there."
1,repetitive,"I guess if you are a big fan of Peabo Bryson, this CD collection is for you...but for the rest of us who like a little surprise now and then, this collection stinks. This is supposed to be about love ballads, and when someone thinks of love ballads, we should be taken back to the eighties and early nineties, and this collection actually has an MC Hammer song on it. There are too many good songs from that era to use him...Madonna's Crazy for you is missing, Michael Jackson is missing...Def Leppard...we could allt hink of hundreds of great tunes, yet none of them are here. I can't even hear the songs in my head these songs are truely for somebody who knows all the songs, good and bad..."
2,Get the fleece one instead!,"Material is flimsy, and the clasp keeps falling off. Overall, the robe is made poorly. I would suggest spending a few more dollars and get the fleece alternative."
3,harry potter robe,"was just at universal studios and they where selling robes for 130 bucks, this robe was alot cheaper and does the same thing granted the other one was made out of a better thicker material...........but so what its for kids to play around with. If your an adult and wanted to walk around in this thing or even the 130 dollar ones.... well come see me give me 130 bucks and Ill sell you the fake invisible blanket......and it would go like this (YOU) here is your 130 bucks (ME) heres your blanket (YOU) what blanket? (ME) its invisible sucker thanks for the 130 bucks."
4,Exactly what he wanted!,It's been all Harry Potter all the time at our house lately and Santa brought this costume for my 6 year old. The clasp is slightly tricky to attach but other than that it is perfect.
3,Party at Hogwarts Miami,"Item was as described, quality is OK but not great. You get what you pay for. Nothing more. MY kids had a party with it and they did enjoy it very much"
3,Product was as expected,No surprises. This is a costume that my son will wear a couple times and it was built that way. It looked good and served its purpose.
1,Horribly made,"I am so disappointed in this robe. The hood was sewn on in a way that made it impossible for the robe to look good when it was closed. It wasn't straight so one side hung down further than the other and there were about 2 inches of unfinished seam sticking out on the other side. I'm a seamstress and other than unpicking and resewing it, there was no way to make it look good. I ended up having to roll the seam and stitch the hood to the lapel just to make it wearable, and it still looked dumb.I bought this in 2 different sizes and both of them were horribly sewn, but one was much worse than the other. This is the first year I've bought my kids' Halloween costumes instead of sewing them myself and it was a big mistake."
4,Son Loves It But Not Too Durable,"My son, a serious Harry Potter fan, wore this constantly for over two weeks and loved it. Its a fairly thin material (but for the price I didn't expect super durability) and soon he had holes in it, but I expect he wasn't easy on the material. In any case, I have ordered him another one and it makes him really happy. So, its worth every penny. UPDATE: Tried to change durability to three stars as I didn't mean to list it as two stars, but can't get the system to recognize the change."
3,"He likes it, but I'm not impressed","My son has been begging for a Harry Potter costume for months. We finally gave in and purchased this. He is very happy with it. I on the other hand am not impressed with the quality. The clip that holds it closed broke on day 1, and to be honest the whole thing is just not partcularly good quality. This means that it is going to wear out pretty quickly and will end up in the trash sooner that it should."
2,Not worth the money,"I bought this as a Halloween costume and it came with the robe and the clasp. The clasp wouldn't stay on no matter how we positioned it. The robe was nice enough, but kept falling off the shoulders when we finally gave up on the clasp. Then we had to spend an additional $18 for the tie! My son was so happy to have a Harry Potter costume, but now will not even use it for dress up because of the aggravation."
4,Great plain language Bible,I believe that the Bible can be very intimidating for a young person and that plain language Bibles are a great way to get acquainted with it. If you tend towards literalism then don't bother.
2,Caution! Verse numbers are not listed,This was the first time that I have used the Message version of the Bible.I like the version BUT the verses are not numbered in this edition. Don't get this one...get the one that lists the verse numbers.
3,The Message Remix offers insights,I would not recommend it for a primary Bible. It is a nice companion to look at a passage from another vantage point.
2,NOt the bible that was pictured,"When we ordered the Bible that was pictured we were expecting a green Bible. A pink Bible arrived in the mail not a green one. I emailed the seller and he stated that even though pink, green and blue were pictured, only pink was available. If all colors are not available then somewhere in the description it needs to be stated. The pink Bible arrived in wonderful condition and we kept it to give as a gift while we are still searching for a green Bible."
2,What is hypercolor and tutleback?,"I was fairly interested in this Bible but could not find any details on just what Pink, Hypercolor and Turleback was all about. Also that it came with a slipcover but showed this Bible in Blue, Green, and Pink. It would be helpful if an explanation of how it was different, other than in just color and how you could get something other than pink."
1,a crock,"Liar liar pants on fire! Not worthy of a 1 rating, but system requires at least a 1 star rating."
5,The Message is great!,"I Love the Message Bible. It is very clear and goes straight to the heart. I wouldn't recommend it as a study bible, but its great for reading and great to read along with another version."
2,Unfortunately this is no Tracey Takes On,"This series is very predictable, the characters are uninteresting and the dialog is more crude than funny. Tracey used to be fresh, fun and above all funny. This series just seems to repeat the same scenarios in each episode with F and S bomb explatives thrown in. Very sad for someone so talented to have to stoop so low."
5,Caesar at his best,"High school history teaches who specialize in Ancient History are often hard pressed to locate good material for their students. Barter's book brings a sigh of relief for the period of the Late Roman Republic and Early Empire. Accurate, well footnoted, dramatic in its presentation, and well organized, Barter traces the antecedents of the great Roman civil wars culminating in the dictatorship of Caesar, his murder, and ultimately the fall of the Republic and the rise of the first Emperor, Augustus."
1,customer unservice,"Nice watch, came defective. Amazon is impossible to deal with during a return. Just try finding their phone number, to India."
3,Flawed but interesting,"Swashbuckled is correct; the book could have used a good editor, and the murder theory seems more like an attempt to sell the book than to have any real foundation. But flawed as it is the research about her life and especially her life before fame is well documented. There is a bibliography, footnotes and an index, all rare in such biographies. For those curious about a beautiful actress with a secret interracial marriage who apparently took her life at the age of 35 the book provides ample material for speculation."
3,Where did you get this book?,"I was a fan in childhood and would love to read this book, even though it sounds upsetting to say the least, and I really liked The Farmer's Daughter rather than any of her darker stuff.But I cannot find it for less than 519.00 on Amazon and I cannot imagine who would pay that."
3,He's just getting started,"Cozzens' first book about the Civil War's western theatre admittedly is easily the least compelling, but still a good read. Calling this book ""bad"" as another reviewer did, is just bizarre. If you're not interested in the Civil War, don't read books about it. This is, for the most part, a well-written, fine account of the Battle of Murfreesboro, or Stones River. The main problem is a sometimes-confusing rundown of troop movements, not helped by even more perplexing maps. I had a great deal of trouble figuring out just where everybody was on the battlefield. Cozzens' next two books in this ""trilogy"" remedy most of the problems and are big steps forward."
3,"Good detailed account of the battle, but sometimes drags","This book provides an excellent account of the character of General Bragg and the Confederate army at Stones River. Details of the battle are complete and detailed, but book lacks the intimacy of other Cozzens books on Civil Wars battles. Nevertheless, a thorough account of the battle and worth a read."
4,Historically accurate,My husband read this book. He enjoyed the battle descriptions. He is reading his way through the Civil War history.
2,Not even close,"Fitment was not even close on my 2001 Ford Explorer Sport Trac. I expected a laser-like fitment. Even the retention holes didn't even come close to fitting on the floor anchors on both the front and the rear floor mats. I've heard good reviews of this product. Perhaps they just made a mistake with my year and make of vehicle, although I do see another negative review from another Explorer owner. The quality of the material is excellent - heavy-duty construction and material. Unfortunately, I'm stuck with returning the mats and to make matters worse, they're making ME pay for the shipping! Ouch!"
5,Great Practical Strategies,THis book is an excellent resource for high school teachers with struggling readers. It is full of strategies that you can take into the classroom and use immediately.
5,"Enjoyable, lite science reading","It is an interesting book and is easy to read. It is broken up into chapters, and in each chapter is a one to two page sections on a particular subject like telepathy. It hits a wide area of subjects.Andre Bormanis, science advisor for the Star Trek franchise, explains the science in broad layman's terms, but enough to explain the basics and the logic behind what the team did.I enjoyed reading it even with a sever lack of previous knowledge in some of the areas. It gave a neat look into the why they handle the science on the show. If you don't have too much time to sit down and read or you just want to have something to read during the commercials, this is an good book to have."
5,It's beautiful.,"This is a beautiful story, a work of art. I read it ten years ago and still have not forgotten it."
4,Remind of us ourselves...,"Fantastic lyrics...instead of cliches poorly pasted together, ""Human after all"" is filled with observations and memories that should take anyone back to the years when things were simpler...especially ""Why we say goodnight"". Put this album on in the car, drive down a quiet, open road or in rush hour traffic, somehow, the moods of music on this album fit both."
4,Very Funny with a ton of knowledge,This is the Lupica book that I have brought and from what I have read it is a very funny book. I could not stop laughing at some sections.
4,Love the colors,"The colors are some of my favorite. Fantasy black, Navy and Utopia. Very old colors but traditional and usable in the work place."
1,Quite simplistic.,I took this book from the library because I always review a book before I buy it. This author is stuck in a feel good mentality that doesn't cut it in our narcissistic society.I wish I could recommend another book on this point. Leil Lowndes does a fairly good job on people skills with her books. But using this guy's techniques will only make you look like a pushover. Waste of time book~
1,Unplayable,"This blu-ray of Alban Berg's opera 'Lulu' promised to be very appealing. I am sure it would live up to that promise, if only the disc could be played. There is some flaw in the programming so that only one menu option appears: ""Scene Selections: Act"". Pressing enter, play, arrow keys, or any other key on the remote, are all to no avail. There is no way to actually play the disc."
2,Not Worthy Of The Legacy,"Folks, I love Gram just as much if not more than the next guy, but I have to advise you to spend your money elsewhere. As other reviewers have mentioned, the material is folk, not country or rock. Which there's nothing wrong with; after all, much of Gram's writing was influenced by folk. However, as you listen to this disc, it's clear that Gram has not yet found his voice that would elevate his songs into the cosmos. The sound is surprisingly good, but this is clearly the work of an artist in the embryonic stage. It's almost as if Gram came to the realization after these recordings that he wasn't going to become the next Bob Dylan. It doesn't even begin to approach the greatness he would attain starting with the ISB and onwards. If you feel you must hear this disc, borrow it from somebody. It's not something you will play repeatedly."
4,I luv It!,"The first time i really listened to this song a freind had lent me the Cd and i played it over and over to learn the lyrics and couldn't get it out my head after the first time! its scary. it has an awesome sound, you will luv it!"
5,Great Make your own Easter Molds,I love that I can make my own Easter Bunnies for my kids. I can use chocolate that I pick out as most of the ones you buy pre-made in the stores have a bunch of junk in them. These arrived really fast and they were what I expected.
3,Yet another slant on the story,"Ingrid Seward, the Editor of Majesty magazine, has long been known as a great fan of HRH Prince Charles. When reading the book you must keep this in mind. She makes her living by writing about The Royal Family every month. She is going to tell this story and put them in a good light."
1,The Queen and Di: The Untold Story by Ingrid Seward,"I would not recommend this book to anyone. I felt cheated. The book was extremely biased on part of the Queen. I do not think that Ingrid Seward was objective as a writer. It is such a pity that she could not give any respect to the person that made her magazine sell. Back in the 80's, Diana was prominently featured in Majesty magazine. No one bought it to see what the Queen wore. I was expecting a little more honesty than I read in this book. Queen Elizabeth and Diana were just people. A mother and daughter in-law. There was a divorce. No one is perfect, but this book would lead you to believe that all the royals were. Save your money."
2,Totally biased and unbelievable.,"I had no idea until I read this book how ""sainted"" the Queen actually was. It was actually hard to read, the author was so completely biased that I found it hard to believe anything that was written after awhile. The premise is basically that Diana was a kook and the Queen was a patient, saintly woman who only thought of what was best for Diana. If one is to believe this book, then every other book written about Diana has been full of lies. Although most of the books ARE biased in one way or another, toward one person or another - this writer must be on the Queen's payroll. A nice fairytale."
2,enough!,ennough already!the princess of wales is dead. let's leave her to rest in peace.ingrid seward is respected journalist. this book lowers my opinion of her considerably.
3,Pretty Good Reading,"I typically like Ingrid Seward's writings, but I can't help but feel that she's trying to prove a point that keeps ""see-sawing"" here. She had private meetings with Princess Diana and got to know her first-hand, but she still can't seem to grasp the ""Magic"" that was Diana. She often refers to her as ""ill"", which she wasn't. She sides more often with the Queen, but still disses her on occasion, too. She also tends to repeat the same thing over and over again throughout the book. Some may regard her point of view as objective, but I found it wishy-washy. The book would be pretty good reading for someone who is a Diana fan, or simply a royalty buff, because it contains some interesting tidbits that even I had never read before, but for the most part it's well-trod ground all over again."
1,Palace Propoganda,This book is definitely biased in favor of the House of Windsor. It appears that the author thought it prudent to align herself with the powers that be rather than report an accurate historical account. There are too many contradictary sources to believe that this is an accurate portrayal of the relationship between the Queen and Princess Diana.
3,A Royal Spoiled Bunch,"""The Queen and Di: The Story of the English Schoolteacher Brought to the British Court to Teach and Tame the Ruler's Four Unruly Children."" Get real. This was an easy timekiller, but do we really need to be reminded that the ""Royals"" didn't have much use for Diana? Duh! There wasn't much in the way of an untold story here, however well-written the book. It also seems to me that the author threw in some veiled, but well barbed, anti-American sentiments, but maybe I'm just naturally suspicious. Supposedly this book was partially based on interviews with the Princess of Wales, particularly one conducted not long before her death. The author is obviously a talented writer, but none of this is anything new."
4,Perfect,"This case is perfect for my needs. I have an HP Pavilion dm1 netbook and it fits perfectly in this case. I also can fit my Kindle in the side pocket. The larger power cord is a bit bulky so I pack it separately for travel, but it would fit if I wanted everything together. I also love the green color."
1,Do not purchase - dangerous.,"Only purchased 6 days ago, used pot 4 times on top of the stove and the teflon, or whatever it pretends to be, peeled off. Must be dangerous to ingest. Product made in China."
1,mine peeled off too,Black stuff on inside baking surface peeled after short careful use. I would not purchase product or similar again. Cast iron would be a better choice.
5,Wife loves it!,She had one like it that she uses when we take out our camper. She liked it so much we got another.
5,Amazing! Too bad Amazon doesn't currently sell it,"This is amazing Christian delicate pop. It has plenty of different instruments including oboe, harp, cello, violin and mostly piano. The lyrics are meaningful and deep unlike a lot of other christian music out there. Plus, her voice is beautiful.If you can't find this album on Amazon try cdbaby.com ."
1,"YOU HAVE TO BE ""KIDDING"" ME U MUST HAVE WROTE YOUR OWN REVIEW...OMG :(","YOU HAVE TO BE ""KIDDING"" ME U MUST HAVE WROTE YOUR OWN REVIEW...OMG :(I LISTENED TO THIS CD AND WAS THINKING TO MYSELF ....THIS IS THE WORST CD I HAVE EVER HEARD IN MY LIFE...I FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE A PERSON WOULD WRITE A GOOD REVIEW FOR IT????...SO MR LIKES MUST HAVE WROTE HIS OWN REVIEW...LOL...AND PLEASE TAKE UP A DIFFRENT HOBBY LIKE HORSE BACK RIDING OR CRAFTS....GIVE UP SINGING ..I CANT SING...AND YOU CANT SING EITHER:)..PLEASE I KNOW YOUR A GODLY MAN ...SO FOR GODS SAKE STOP SINGING...GOD BLESS AND GOOD DAY :)THANK YOU"
3,Not bad but not that great either.,I bought this for my 08 F150 and it doesnt really fit the contour of the seat very well. Therefore it tends to slide around a bit. The main reason I went with this one is because my truck has a standard transmission and it was the only one that wouldnt be in the way of the shifter. The adjusters on the cupholders dont really work that well either. With not much force they will pop back out to the next position.. The rest of it seems fairly sturdy and the storage compartments seem to work well. Not a terrible product but there are better consoles out there.
4,Good Product,"Nice console, has worked very well on my bench seat in my Silverado. It would be nice if it was another 4-5 inches wider though. Pretty good product for the price and provides a little more comfort to a bench seat."
4,Good for shoulder.,"Good shoulder rest, I'm having shoulder pains and my truck didn't come with an arm rest, this works well for that, extends out far enough and has thick foam on top. Storage inside is a bonus. Also I like the cup holders, however it would be nice if there wasn't such a huge gap in the center. If you have a large cup on just one side, move the other side in all the way to act as a stopper."
3,Useful and Easy,Had no problems with the installation. Center seat belt holds the unit in place. I have a 97 GMC with a bench seat so this addition makes the ride more comfortable and keeps important items well within reach.
5,Outstanding Seller...Shipped as Advertized and Fast...Great Product!!!,"Great Product...I would Recommend this to anyone!! Fit great in my 2006 Chevy Silverado 4X4...uses your seatbelt to secure. It would be nice if it was a little bit bigger though, but the price was outstanding."
2,wont last long,"I will say this looks nice but the materal is very low quality and the attachment device doesent work with seat belts like it says, you have to make a hold down in order for your seat move. Thanks"
4,Good product,This wasnt a bad deal for the center console could ahve been a little more wide works great for my chevy 06 Wt single cab!
3,Not what I expected,"Expected this to be a replacement for front center console. Its for the back seat.I still found it to be useful, just not as originally intended.Shoddy construction (strap on bottom for seat belt to go through fell off during install)"
4,I Like the First Two Stories Best,I liked this book. The first story with Felix was adorable. The only problem I had with this book was the last story. It didn't capture my imagination.
2,Hoodia patch..,"Well, I didn't get to use them much because as soon as I started to I began to get very severe headaches..so, I had to stop using them and my headaches are gone..however, while I did use them I found I had increased energy and less of an appetite..which was what I wanted..just not the headaches!"
1,don't waste your time,doesn't do anything. don't waste your money. only way to truly lose weight is through diet and exercise
1,DON'T WORK !!!!!!!,"I BROUGHT THE PATCHES AND THEY DO NOT STOP MY CRAVINGS , IF ANY THING IT GIVES ME A HEADACHE AND MAKES ME EVEN MORE HUNGRY. PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE."
3,"fans will enjoy, newcomers may not be convinced","Track listing is out of sequence. Performance varies from fairly energetic but not exactly rocking, to woozy. I expected something folkier. Snappy take on ""The Yip! Song"", cute a cappella harmonizing on ""Uncorrected"". When the band takes on its well-played, medium-slow, shiny, langorous groove, the words don't stand out quite enough, and the music loses me, as is typical in Robyn Hitchcock's post Soft Boys bands; ""Globe of Frogs"" works with this treatment, the rest is just okay."
3,Not Original,"Even that the picture show is from an original Lenovo battery, the one that I got is not.It has the problem that, when is about 40% of remaining power, somehow sends to the computer the signal of it is almost exhausted, so laptop goes into suspend mode.And the machine is saying all the time: ""you don't have an original Lenovo battery""With that said, so far the battery is running well."
3,you should complain,All three reviewers - you paid for an OEM battery and apparently didn't get one. Send it back!
3,Not OEM,Product did not carry OEM label. Appears to be recycled/recharged battery. Only time will tell of it holds up as claimed..
2,Bad Battery!,Purchased the longer life battery and it runs for less time than the standard battery! Must be defective. Being returned!
5,Fantastic overview,"A wonderful book from a great professor. I was a student of Padma Catell's and found her dynamic teaching style, echoed in this book, to be straightforward and digestible. She used this text in our class, and it helped me to breakdown the wealth of the material and learn it with ease. As a result of her text, I am able to assist my clients in their understanding around meds, drugs, alternatives, and addiction. Very helpful book for students and practitioners alike - highly recommended! - Cris Walker Roskelley, MFT, Author of ""On the Road to Becoming a Successful Marriage and Family Therapist: An Insider's Handbook From Graduate School Through Licensure... and Beyond!"""
5,"Written in no-nonsense, unbiased terms","Drugs & Clients: What Every Psychotherapist Needs To Know by Padma Catell (Associate Professor of Psychology, California Institute of Integral Studies) is a straightforward reference informing psychotherapists and lay readers alike of the basic facts concerning common psychoactive medications as well as non-prescription psychoactive drugs such as alcohol, antihistamines, nicotine, caffeine, cocaine, marijuana and more. Written in no-nonsense, unbiased terms, it describes the effects of drugs, how they are viewed by the modern American legal system, health risks, results of statistical studies, and more. A superb resource manual for anyone needing to acquaint themselves with the basics of common psychoactive chemicals."
5,A must for both professionals and their clients,"A lucidly written, well-researched, fully updated survey of the field of psychopharmacology. Concise, eminently readable, thoroughly referenced, this gem of a book includes a tour d'horizon of various mental health problems - from sleep disorders to psychotic episodes. Each chapter reviews relevant medications and drugs, their effects, benefits, and dangers, as well as practical advice on how to administer and handle them. The clean and intuitive illustrations and tables enhance this tome's allure....Drugs and Clients is a must reference for anyone who deals with human suffering and the human mind. Sam Vaknin, author of Malignant Self Love - Narcissism Revisited."
3,Diamonds too small,"The ring seemed to be of good enough quality, but the diamonds were too small to pair it with my engagement ring so we had to return it. The ring had plenty of sparkle, but due to the size of the stones, it seemed more like a glitter sparkle than a diamond sparkle. There wasn't any depth to it."
1,Don't waste your time on this Ring,"IT'S NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURE THEY SHOULD BE A SHAME OF THEM SELFS THIS PICTURES IS SO ENLARGED WHEN I OPENED THE BOX THE FIRST THING CAME OUT OF MY MINE IS ROSILAND THEY SAW YOU COMING I BOUGHT TWO OF THESE RINGS AND I DID'NT EVEN BOTHER TO OPEN UP THE OTHER RING I BOUGHT THEM TO STACK WITH MY OTHER RING YOU CAN'T EVEN SEE THE DIAMONDS IN THE RING. THAT'S JUST HOW SMALL THEY ARE DON'T DO IT. I OPEN THE RINGS IN MY CAR AND I WENT STRAGHT TO THE POST OFFICE.ROSILAND R. JOHNSON DALLAS, TEXAS"
2,You get what you pay for:(,"I ordered two of these rings to wear as stackers, but I should have known better than to expect quality at the price that I paid. The ""diamonds"" are so full of visible black inclusions that the rings look grey."
3,Not a good purchase!,"I bought this ring because it looked like it would match my engagement ring perfectly judging by the picture.We got it in the mail and it was a cute ring, but looked NOTHING like the picture.The diamonds are not aligned, they are placed on crookedly, the metal is bent, curved, and has dips in it, and some of the prongs are sticking up.Like I said, cute ring, very sparkly, but very cheaply made."
3,Slight disappointment,"Of all the things we forgot to do before our wedding, we didnt ring shop, I guess we got caught up in everything else. So as with my entire life, I ordered our bands on Amazon, I was pleasantly surprised with how cute it was. About a month or so after our wedding, I noticed one of the stones had fallen out of the ring. I'm slightly disappointed in the quality, but if yourin a pinch and need something inexpensive to do the job, this ring will fir the bill."
3,Not exactly what I expected...,"I bought this CD because I heard Prisoner of Society and thought it ruled. But that's the only song that I really like on it. Growing Up (Falling Down) is pretty good and so is Second Solution. But they remind me a lot of the Stray Cats and don't sound like Green Day a bit to me. But all in all, this is a pretty good, solid album."
5,Buy This CD!,"The Living End created a CD that is much better than anything Green Day did (save maybe Dookie). Anyway, this CD is full of great solos, terrific lyrics, and just plain old awesome punk music. Pick it up!"
4,METAL JAZZ....THEY HAVE A STRAY CATS KIND OF FEEL,PRISONER OF SOCIETY IS A GREAT SONG....THATS WHAT MADE ME BUY THIS ALBUM IN THE FIRST PLACE.......I SAW THEM IN CONCERT TWICE....I THOUGHT THEY WERE PRETTY COOL SO I BOUGHT THE CD....ANYWAY...ITS REALLY COOL....THEY SOUND LIKE THE STRAY CATS AND GREENDAY AND HAVE A PRETTY COOL SOUND....SO I RECOMMEND THIS CD TO ANYONE WHO LIKES THOSE BANDS OR TO ANYONE WHO LIKES FAST PACED MUSIC
5,"OUT OF 300 CDS I OWN, THIS IS THE BEST!!!!!",This cd is absolutely the best blend of music and vocals I have ever heard. I didn't even know that they had this kind of music in Australia until I listened to this. What's more impressive is that The Living End only has 3 band members and a stand up base. BUY THIS CD AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!!!!! You won't regret it.
4,Sex Pistols/Clash but with greater guitar virtuosity,"My 2-second review is that it reminds me of kids who grew up listening to the Sex Pistols and the Clash, but they play the guitar better than either of those bands do..."
5,Try Not To Dance!,"Right, spped, intricacy, catcy tunes, AND a doulbe bass. Something here for everone. The guitars lay it down and then build up to wicked solos, whilst the double bass just grabs your soul and forces it to dance.Before you know it you are singing along, bouncing up and down, and this is just from a disc. Real fun music, and that is how it should be!"
5,"Go and buy this CD, NOW!","This CD is incredible!!!! There is nothing bad to say about it and so may good things that I can't type them all because I am too lazy. Every song on the CD rocks. The guitar in every song is enough to make the whole area shake. All the songs are great but i have to say that the best ones are ""Growing Up (Falling Down)"", ""Second Solution"", and ""I Want A Day"". They are also an incredible live band. I first heard them at an Offspring concert and they were easily a better band than the Offspring. You CANNOT go wrong with this CD and I'm telling you to buy it NOW!"
5,kicks but in a hard hard way,"this cd rocks and I don't have to say much more. Buy it, cherish it, listen to it, but more important be the music. Let it flow through your soul and mind and it will alter your life in a positive way. I feel connected, why don't you give it a try?"
5,Mom of toddler,"My daughter is 3 yrs 4 months and she just loves this bike. She is petite for her age and will get lots of use out of it. I searched hard to find a good, unisex design that my 10 month old son can grow into later on, and this is perfect. It is very sturdy, easy to assemble, and seems better quality than most training bikes where the training wheels don't both touch the ground. THe hand break is a nice addition."
2,Shrinkage,"I tried these on having bought 2 pairs of 514 slim straights back in 2010, & the new ones were pretty close in size to the old, so off went the tags & into the (cold) wash they went. When they came out, they had shrunk like the dickens - in the waist, the thighs, & in the calves. Now I can't return them, nor can I even get my (admittedly not terribly large) legs into them."
1,No consistency in model numbers = JOKE,"How can Levis give four completely different pants the same model number? It is a joke of the first order. How are you supposed to ever find the jeans you like when you can *NEVER* count on getting them twice in a row using the same model number? Who is the genius who decided that '514' should be applied to all manner of totally different pants? I will never patronize Levis again - number one they are made in Bangladesh or Columbia, number two they are literally morons at Levis, and morons don't deserve our business."
2,So mad,"I bought these awhile ago, don't get me wrong they look real nice but the material shrinks badly. They fit me perfectly at 1st but after a few washes they were able to fit my mother, so I gave them to her. I'm 6'4, she's 5'8... Enough said, if you take the risk buy them wider and longer."
3,disappointed,I purchased this watch a gift for our ringbearer in our wedding trying to make our little man feel like one of the grown ups. He loved the watch but it does work. I will have to return it and our little ringbearer needless to say is disappointed.
5,"Posters, posters and more posters!",I found the collection of posters in this book to be amazing! It has such a wide range of artists and designers. Anyone who is a fan or a pro would love this book.
4,Source for inspiration,"I must say, as a graphic designer I'm always looking for inspirational objects all around me so, this a collection you'll never find disappointing. All of the posters listed inside are in every range of design trend and illustration techniques and so are fantastic at any level: creative, conceptual and symbolic. Every featured designer is given an introduction and a light analysis on their work so you can get an idea of who these guys are. I gave 4 of 5 stars only because I wanted at least the double of pages and posters but it's a fair trade."
3,"Well crafted stories, but not for everyone.","It is difficult to evaluate a book which so adeptly accomplishes its seeming purpose of making the reader shudder and want to turn away. This collection of short stories about this life's bleakest inhabitants and their miserable circumstances is not a book to be read for enjoyment, at least in the usual sense of the word. Some of the characters are so peculiar that they do inspire at least a smile, if not actual laughter, but I cannot recommend the book to anyone but those who revel in reading about the seamy, sordid underbelly of the lives of unfortunate people."
3,"Would I re-read this, or not?","Although this makes a good stab at being a civilised mystery, I would not re-read it.It lacks life, a lot of the descriptions were out of my experience and I could not find definitions anywhere (sporting a door?), and somehow this irritated me rather than stimulating me.It is an OK read, but does not live."
2,who designed this?,"i dont know who the crap designed this knife, but they should be fired LOL. i got a hold of this knife from a friend of mine. the blade is a decent drop point and is made of 420 hc, so not to bad. but the handle is so UN-ERGONOMIC that its a pain just to hold the knife let alone cut anything with it. its made of plastic which is not a huge deal but whatever. the blade is really hard to open and really slow. theres no pocket clip and it has a little bit of play side to side, but not to bad. over all i give this knife a 2 out of 10."
3,Could be better or could be worse,I somewhat had my hopes up for this cd. I took a chance and perchased this one over keyholderwhich i can see was a mistake. This record seems to be more about sounds and various tunes.instead of giving each song a great melodius direction. As a result the songs are mediocer.I dont think that in time they will grow on me but it will probaly take a few more spins. I wouldgive this album a 2 star rating but according to amazon that means you hate the cd. I dont hatethis record but so i have to give it a 3. I think a five star rating system is too small to give properfeed back maybe they will increase it to a 7 or 10 stars system some day.
4,Like it but smaller than expected,"The bowls were delivered quickly in perfect shape. Were the exact color and style as shown on the web. They were smaller than expected more like a cereal bowl in my house, but that's my only complaint."
4,Individual pasta bowls,"They were a gift, so I've not used them. They looked good, however. Nice size, color fits with other items."
5,worth it.,"It is slightly heavier than the aluminum version, but the fact that it locks more than makes up for that fact. The one draw back is you sometimes need both hands to get it set on the duct work."
4,"Pretty good value, a little tight on space if you carry 14 clubs","Took this on a trip to Austin and it was pretty flawless. The wheels really helps when trying to get around with my carry on and lap top bags flopping all over the place. The case could have used a little more weight in the bottom to balance it a little more, imo. And now that I've added another wedge and a new FW, up to 14 clubs it would be a tight squeeze to get hte top on but it should be doable. All in all it was a great purchase."
4,Ortho Bionomy Manual - Great for practicing therapists,"Ortho Bionomy, a practical manual is a good summation of the various techniques for practicing this theraputic modality. I consider Ortho Bionomy to be a bit like Chiropractic, in that it deals with manipulating the joints. It is a great technique for massage therapists to add to thier repertoire. I would recommend taking a weekend seminar in this methodology, rather than just trying to pick it up from the book. Many techniques are such that you need to observe them first person. For therapists wishing to utilize Ortho Bionomy as part of thier practice, the book is certainly useful, even more so when combined with a seminar taught by a qualified instructor."
3,DEEP FOREST lite,"If you like the music of DEEP FOREST, you might like this album. The orchestration is not as lush and complex as that of Deep Forest and many of the songs can get repetetive. Ikarus' simplistic formula: take a small sample of indigenous singing, add an exotic instrument or two, throw in backbeats, stir and repeat (and repeat). One exception: the last song blatantly---and unsuccessfully---tries to recreate the sound of Karl Jenkins' ""Adiemus."" Overall, OK, but there are better CDs out there within this genre. For example, check out Waterbone's excellent album ""Tibet."""
3,"Good, but not good enough","I loved Praying to Different Gods, but Touch the Sun...well, what can i say. I was a bit disappointed. The first song, touched the sun, is my kind of music, but most of the songs after that were kinda boring-- so unlike Wolfy (at least to me it seemed that way). but i do recommend buying Praying to Different Gods. But no matter. Ikarus is TIGHT!"
2,Godawful recording,"I'm a Calvert nut, and despite the warnings I thought I would find something to treasure from this recording, made in the last year of his life. Forget it. It's not bootleg quality. Most bootlegs I have owned make this recording sound like crud. I was hoping for the witty between-tracks banter Bob delivered on other live tapes, but there's little of it here, and the title track is drowned out by some girl shouting abuse at her boyfriend.Loop"
5,Best hammer ever,I've had this hammer for over five years. This is the best hammer I have ever swung. I will buy another one once this one gives out. I'm a professional carpenter so I have a lot of use for for hammers.
2,TiTech Unbreakable,"For 20 years I've swung 20 oz hammers. It usually takes me 2-3 years to break a fiberglass handle pulling 16's with 1 yank- wooden hadles last only days tearing out conc forms/demo/etc. I'd buy a stilletto if it had a fiberglass handle. I loved the TiTech's burly handle, I Loved the magnet, But the head is way to wide I can't set a toenail in a corner a traditional small head is superior with my accuracy. As welll if you hit off center with the giant wide head it glances off. The interchangeable head seems dumb, it kind of rattles. The TiTech head came off the handle in under 2 months, the epoxy failed. This is the first time Vaughn has ever let me down. I am waiting for a Real 16 oz. Ti fiberglass waffle head with magnet."
4,Sizzling platter,"It's the best way to cook meat, and side dishes, hot and juicy!A great addition for the BAR B Q King!!!!!!!"
5,Most Important Birthday Gift I Got This Year.,"When asked what I wanted, I would say there isn't anything I need. With the stress of family court facing me I couldn't enjoy even my birthday. My best friend came through again. The copy of 'Witness Guide' he gave me as a gift has eased the burden considerably. Easy to read with sound advice. I needed it for my child custody case and ended up using it for a company deposition. I highly recommend this book."
5,GREAT,"Great book for a first time visiter to court-itll help you relax and understand the basics of body language, what to say, not to say etc. A must for someone who must testify."
5,Greatest baseball game ever. Period.,"I grew up with this game, and no baseball game I have played since it has even come close to match its addictiveness, smoothness of gameplay, and just plain fun value. If you have a Saturn, don't let your collection be without this game!"
3,Polygons unite,This reviewed well on many sites and its pretty decent. Im partial to 2D games in the era of chunky polygons but the flow and pace is good. Music and sounds are pretty cool. You do have some extra features like home run derby but all modes feel pretty straight forward with no real excitement. World Series on the Genesis did this better. Always a joy to play with the old rosters. The Big Hurt in the HRD. Very cool. Ill enjoy this more when I get used to the chunks again.
1,Another excursion away from reality by Wilson,"What is abundantly clear is that if Jesus Christ himself appeared and made it known once and for all that the Shroud of Turin was not his death shroud, Wilson would begin work the next day on a new book to explain why Jesus was wrong. Wilson has absolutely no intention of setting aside his personal beliefs for any reason whatsoever, as revealed by his failure to adhere to his previous statements that carbon dating would settle this issue.If anyone is truly interested in an unbiased, and possibly even accurate, scientific analysis of how the Shroud came to be, who it represents and why the Catholic church disowned it for the longest time, you may want to read ""The Hiram Key"" and ""The Second Messiah"", by Christopher Knight and Robert Lomas."
1,What a joke!,"Ian Wilson's new ""evidence"" insults the intelligence of average readers, for clearly this book was written with a less than average intelligence. The Shroud of Turin is an intriguing bit of history, but not in the ways this work suggests."
1,Very poor science.,"I bought this title with a moderate interest in the Shroud of Turin, though I hoped my interest would improve after getting through this lengthy book. Unfortunately, the science and the history don't make as compelling a case as the author would like to believe. Very often an outrageous conclusion is reached (i.e. about something being definitive proof of the Shroud's authenticity), when another more common (but less exciting) conclusion would be more appropriate."
1,There is one born every minute,the reason it has taken me a while to write a comment on this book is because i have only now stopped laughing! dribble is the only way to describe wilsons' absurd conclusions.
3,Some good content but hard to decipher,"I thought the authors were brave to take on such a challenge. I believe their goal must have been to produce an account of Church history that would make it interesting and informative for the lay believer. I feel, to a large extent, that they succeeded in that goal. Much of their content is witty, humorous, and even-handed. They prove themselves students of Church history and have done their homework. The work does not claim to be anywhere near an exhaustive account of the Christian Church in history.One problem I had was reading the book in paperback. I do not know if the first edition was a hardcover printed on fine quality stock. All I know is that the softcover used an inferior ""newsprint"" stock; also, some of the sidenotes and features were so dark that I often had to strain to read the words and make sense of the copy. No book should be this hard to decipher. If it's available, buy the hardcover."
5,Anyone knowing someone with cancer must get this book,"Having spent almost 4 years in the cancer treatment process with my wife, I highly recommend this book. Its wealth of stories, resources, and insights will be invaluable to anyone who finds themselves trying to understand treatment alternatives and make good decisions for themselves or a loved one. I wish this book had been available to provide guidance and hope to my wife and I. I highly recommend that you buy a copy, use it yourself, or give it to someone who needs it. I have given copies to friends going through the cancer experience, and they have all expressed great appreciation for the knowledge, hope, and inspiration they received from ""Cancer Talk""."
4,Not as good as his first book but a worthy addition,"I bought Hoffman's ""Art and Science of Dumpster Diving"" years ago and really liked it (as much as you can like a book about profiting from others waste and laziness)so I decided to get this book when it came out. Both books are semi- autobiographical, telling about how Hoffman was raised doing this subject, but this new book goes a lot more into the political and other commentary stuff. I found that you could almost ignore the first six chapters (out of only nine) of the book and still get most of what there is to learn in the book.If you want this book as a companion to the first (the readers testimonials here will either fascinate or sicken you depending on your point of view) buy it, but if you really want to learn how people dumpster dive get the first book."
1,The Dumpster is where this book belongs!,This book is pure garbage. It is no more than the asinine ramblings of a deranged mind trying to further capitalize on past success.Don't waste your money!
4,Best restoration book I've ever read !,"Very helpful for my 1958 Land Rover restoration. It helps me to verify which part of my Landie's restoration to be self-made, and which part to be ordered. Now that my Landie's restoration done, I was very proud of my Landie. Thanks to the book."
5,Land Rover Restoration Manual,This is an excellent book for anyone that is involved in restoring a Land Rover.LFA
3,Review of restoration workshop manual,"To anyone concerned,This manual uses a combination of original Land Rover information as well as detailed information from recognised restorers! It is invaluable to people wanting to restore early model Land Rovers."
4,Great Costume!,"This outfit is adorable! We have a corgi and it was the perfect fit for him. The only problem is that the little cap with the eyes doesn't stay on his head very well, but he doesn't like it very much so it's alright; it still looks cute! I would definitely recommend this as a fun outfit or Halloween costume for any dog owner who enjoys playing dress up with their pooch!"
4,Does the job.,I bought thus unit because of the mounting provisions. They allowed me to screw it to my work bench and create some handy plug locations for various tools as I use them.
2,NIGHT FLY Has Flown?,"I sure wish I knew what this product is. I've looked everywhere for it, but no one seems to know of a dual disk on this title. Was this a limited edition?NIGHT FLY would be a prime candidate for a dual disk edition with 5.1 surround and all that noise, because it is a solid and layered recording. So I would alert the record company to make this more widely available or give us more information as to how we could get it!!"
4,Even if it doesn't work it's still good protection,"I've always questioned whether UV filters work on current DSLR cameras. I never see any difference in photo quality with or without a UV filter, and regardless the quality of the filter. I did some research and learned that UV protection was a much bigger concern with film than it is digital. Either way it's still a good filter to have as protection, especially on an internal zoom lens where dust could get in the barrel. Overall, it's a decent, protective, low profile UV filter. Only downside; snapping the lens cap on may be a little tough (as it is with most low profile filters)."
5,Excellent value for a basic filter,"Beats my much more expensive B&W haze filter by a wide margin. Glad I got this to get rid of haze and UV light for my digital photography. Can't beat the value with this filter, sturdy build, fairly thin so probably (haven't tried it yet) suitable for very wide angle lenses too."
4,Pretty good,Just bought this Hoya PRO1 Digital-Filter-UV-77 mm . The purchase process was good and the shiping was swift. Could have given a 5-star rating if there were no crack on the filter box when it arrived.
1,Don't Buy it,"Unbelieviable, I can not believe that someone would make a moving like this in this day and time and have the nerves to call it a Christian movie. If you just have to see this movie, please let me know. You can have mine for free, just pay the shipping."
1,It is REALLY BAD!,"The idea is noble, but the acting, timing, dialogue, storyline and cinematography are all VERY amateurish. It is very painful to watch."
2,"Okay, for what it is...","The Topo software is based on very old maps from 19forgotten, this is not always a bad thing. Easy to use and looks like it was made from a decent scan. Considering the price, you can't really go wrong with this very simple, limited mapping software."
1,Just to look at..not to sit in,"I was so happy to get my 6 parson chairs. They looked fabulous in my dining room. We only use the dining room for holidays and occassional dinner guests so I was extremely upset when I noticed deterioration of the cushion over a one year period. We flipped the chairs upside down and the springs had sprung out the bottom of the chair lining. Since no one is over 160 lbs., this is unsettling. Upon further inspection, the chairs are made in China and the springs were merely tied into the chair with fabric. We thought about calling the company to get replacements but what reason is there to replace it with junk again. Looks like we're shopping for quality chairs this time around."
4,Nail Head Trim Parson Chairs,"I was a little worried about the color when I ordered these chairs on line. You can't tell the true color or pattern by the picture and I did not want red. But they were the style I wanted and the price was right, so I took a chance. I was pleasantly surprised to find them even prettier than expected. The colors are perfect - shades of burgandy, olive green and tan. I put casters on the bottom of one chair and use it to move between my writing desk and computer armoir. The seat cushions could be stuffed some more, but overall they are elegant and just what I wanted for use in my office/den."
2,Better make a day of it,This stuff goes on without much of a problem; however getting it off is another story. This stuff is too hard once it dries (even in the shade) it takes a lot of elbow grease to remove it. I started doing a full-size truck and finally quite halfway through because it took three hours to get the wax off that was already applied and I thought my arm was going to fall off.This wax might be fine if you have a professional buffer/polisher to help remove it. The buffer I have only removed some of the wax and the rest had to be removed by brute force. I will look for a different wax and if you are on the fence about getting this wax I would recommend you do the same.
2,This stuff sucks,"I used this stuff on a friends car and its hard to remove and i used it in the shade and applied a thin coat. And the water beading qualities dont last very long compared to competitors, but for the price its not a bad product, but i like my cars so i dont go cheap. (Dont think i used the product incorrectly cause i been detailing cars for many years)"
5,Works great! love it!,"hands down, no other company can compete with turtle wax. ive been using it for years..and it never fails to live up to its standard. yes, a little work buffing but when your done, you have a vehicle with that deep, showroom shine.turtle wax, im a lifetime customer! great product!"
2,Meh,"I bought this at Target because it was the cheapest thing available and I knew it by name.Mistake.I've used other waxes that I spent more for, and there's a reason they cost more. They're just as effective, but they're not the workout to get off like Turtle Wax is.It was approaching 6PM when I started applying the wax to my new Mazda 3 hatchback, which has suffered from tough water spots. I knew I wouldn't have a ton of light, but I didn't anticipate it taking 90 minutes and a ton of frustration to get the stuff off! By the time I had removed the wax from the hood, roof, and back hatch, it was dark and I still had the sides to do.Also, unless you use a microfiber polishing cloth for removal, it will leave a fine powder all over the car, and in every crevice and crack imaginable.Application was easy. That was the *only* easy part of it. I sure hope it holds up at least a few washes."
3,Cucina Lime Zest and Cypress Hand Wash,Absolutely love this product but the scent on this particular one leaves you questioning WHAT it is as you're washing your hands. The scent fades pretty fast once your hands have dried. I'll use this one up and then try a different scent of the same brand. There is not a hint of lime scent at all.
1,Yuck,"I've had good luck with other fine soaps on Amazon, so I followed the five-star reviews here and bought this one blindly. Mistake! This isn't a fresh citrus scent -- it smells like bug spray! And not the bug spray they sell in the supermarkets today, with strong fruity fragrances cloaking the underlying chemical. This soap smells like old-school, roll-on OFF! bug repellent. My wife made me put it away as soon as she sniffed it. We're back to using Dial pump soap. Blech."
5,Weil Kommt Der Winter Immer Wieder,"Winter music. Not that it's cold and impenetrable; far from it. Only that it evokes for me the beauty of chill and wind and twilight. But then again, I live in south Texas. The lyrics, by the way (in German, natch), are based on the Song Of Solomon and sung by Djong Yun who graced several Popol Vuh works. And apart from Daniel Fichelscher's electric guitar leads (he of Amon Duul II) which are sometimes spidery and double-tracked, it's completely acoustic. RIP Florian."
5,WOW! I was truly impressed with the tenacity of Steel Umbr.,"Mr. Sutherland definitely seems to occasionally strecth language to its fullest, but I was very impressed with the deeper intet of his words and meanings.He seems to travel in poetic directions that are rare and difficult to maintain, but maintain it he does. I would highly recommend this book to readers looking for a new way at looking at poetry, I just this book wasn't so darned expensive!All said, he has inspired my writing and what more could another writer or artist want..."
4,Great History lesson,I picked this up at a thrift store and it ended up being better than I expected. A great History lesson for film buffs and fans of Film Special Effects and Make-up effects. Lots of great interviews and film clips.
2,The new formula sucks...,"I won't be buying these again. The new formula means that the flavor will be gone in a matter of seconds, and hardly making this gum any useful for dental hygiene."
3,Terminally boring,When I read the back of the book I thought it would have been a real medical thriller. I found it rather bland. It took a while to get into it. The idea behind the book reminded me of a Robin Cook book I read. The story did pickup and there was a lot of suspense but the end was a real disappointment.
2,regional dvd,"i received to find out it would not work in my dvd player, i put it in my computer and it said something about not the right region, i did something and then tried it and it worked in 1 dvd player in the house. i tried it in our tv dvd player and it will not work. i am not sure if i plan on keeping this, i really never knew anything about regions and dvd players until now.thank youRandy"
4,Lifesaver,I needed this movie so I chose this to arrive within 2 days. My 3rd grade students finished reading the book so I wanted them to see the differences with the movie! In great shape when I received it!
3,How to eat freid worms,"I supose it's ok, but my husband and I didn't care for the movie , but some of the grandkids did, I didn't see the purpos of it. any way the movie was in good shape when we recived it. thank you. GSG"
2,Novel in Video form for classroom,"The movie itself was what I expected as far as its comparison to the novel that we read in my classroom, however, the quality of the actual video and especially the audio was not what I had expected because of prior experiences with Amazon. I will think twice about ordering DVDs from them again because if a return is necessary, the turn around time isn't fast enough. In other words, I could scoot back to the local store to exchange a poor quality product, but I couldn't with Amazon to fulfill my lesson plans."
3,Nothing like the book have your kids read it instead,I gave it 3 stars because it did make my kids laugh. But over all they were disappointed. I had them read the book first which they thought was much better. The only thing it really had in common with the book is that a kid made a bet to eat worms other than that forget it. I could not bring myself to watch the whole move. The part I disliked the most was that the main character and his little brother hate each other which was entirely uncalled for.
4,Rates because of the kids,"This was a family movie night feature, as are all Walden Media offerings. You never have to worry about watching one of their productions with the kids.Anyway, this basically looked like a made-for-Disney Channel movie. It was fairly low-budget, which meant that the acting had to carry the water. I think these young actors did very well in their roles. It was refreshing to see kids playing outside all over town instead of being glued to some type of screen. The bullies were not physically abusive (or even cruel hearted) as in so many of these *new kid in town* themes. The parents were not complete idiots either, which was refreshing. James Rebhorn as principal Boilerhead ripped his role off from James Tolkan, who played the principal in Back To The Future.Bottom line, my 14 and 16 year-olds liked this movie, the fetching Mrs. Brew and I thought is was just OK. I'll have to admit, my stomach was queasy for some time after watching kids eat worms for 1 1/2 hours."
2,Title of track @ the credits?,Does anyone know the song that is playing at the end of the movie when the credits are rolling? Please help...
2,unnessesary humor,"This movie had some tacky lines in it that were just not nessesary. But this movie is not as much of a boy thing as I thought it would be. But it is a complete KID movie! I don't know of many adults that would find this movie funny, but it's a great way for kids to kill a couple of hours. Though I probably never watch it again."
2,The song that plays at the end is...,"I saw a few people had posted they wanted to know who sang the song at the end of the movie. Ok...I think I might have found you an answer. The one I was thinking of is called ""Move your Feet"" by Junior Senior."
3,GREAT BOOK OK MOVIE,"I READ ""HOW TO EAT FRIED WORMS"" IN 7TH GRADE. IT TURNED INTO ONE OF MY FAVORITE BOOKS. WHEN I HEARD IT WAS GOING TO BE A MOVIE I WAS EXCITED. I JUST RENTED IT ABOUT A WEEK AGO AND I HAVE TO SAY THAT IM SLIGHTLY DISAPPOINTED. THE MOVIE WAS ONLY SOMEWHAT LIKE THE BOOK AND DIDNT REALLY EXPLAIN THE MAIN CHARACTERS TOO WELL. ""HOW TO EAT FRIED WORMS"" IS RATED PG. I SUGGEST THE PARENTAL GUIDANCE. THERES SOME CRUDE HUMOR AND BULLYING AND IT MAY NOT GO OVER WELL WITH SOME PARENTS. RENT IT BEFORE BUYING IT."
4,For Children As Well As Children At Heart,"How To Eat Fried Worms is the classic story of the ""New Kid"" who has to go out of his way to fit in at a new school. I personally do not usually find children's movies to be enjoyable. This movie however is amusing, entertaining and even funny at times. These children are extraordinarily good actors and their realism sucks you into the story and helps you to empathize with the main character. The story is great and made even more amusing by the premise of having to eat worms. This DVD also has some great bonus features, one of which is how they made the worms that were eaten in the movie (no, they didn't eat real worms). If you have a young kid or are just a child at heart, give this movie a try!"
3,"Use as a reference, learn elsewhere","This was the first book I read on the subject, and it left me with a lot of questions. I recommend only using this book as a cross reference to the plants that work best as companion plants. For learning about the whole idea and how to implement it I recommend ""Great Garden Companions"" by Sally Jean Cunningham."
3,Cute Little Book,"This is a cute little book. I'm not sure there was any new information in it that I didn't already have in other books, but I like it anyway!"
4,Worth it for the B-side,"Garbage fans, ""Special #2"" cries out for your love! This CD single isn't as good as ""Special #1"", but it has its place. The B-side, ""13 x Forever"", has turned into one of my favorite Garbage songs - it's an infectious winner that should have been on the album. ""Special"" is still a great song, and one of VERSION 2.0's strongest tracks. The only weak spot here is the dull, unnecessary Brothers in Rhythm remix of ""Special"". Otherwise, ""Special #2"" is a worthy buy."
2,Not as described,"Item was a compact disc, not vinyl as in the description. Seller has issued a refund and let me keep the product. A very nice gesture, but I already own the cd and was trying to get a vinyl copy. Oh well, I will pass this on to a friend that is in need of this disc for their collection seeing as I already own it."
5,Unusual use,"I registered for this as a wedding gift, initially thinking it would be larger. When I opened up the package I thought...well what am I going to do with this? I found the perfect use, it holds my sugar. It is adorable and I am smitten with it! So much cuter than other sugar dishes! Sometimes you just have to think a little out of the box :)"
3,"okay, but I would use it to store salt or spices","I recently bought one of these and ended up returning it. There are only a few instances where I can see this being useful. It would be good for roasting garlic or perhaps making a small fruit desert in the oven. This cannot be used on the stove top and there are no recipes so I really don't know what else to do with it. I thought it was adorable online and would be a welcome addition in my kitchen, but I was mistaken. It is nicely made, but i ended up looking like a gaudy piece (like something from the dollar store). It has a glossy finish. I would not purchase it as a ramekin with a lid is cheaper and more functional. I would liken this to decorating with plastic fruit.If you have a very particular style in your kitchen this could be an awesome salt holder. The lid doesn't stay on that well and the handles are TINY. Also the shape means you can't cook things that need to slide out or be scooped out. Thank you and I am awaiting angry responses."
3,ADORABLE,"FIRST OFF, JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I GOT THIS PEAR FREE WITH PURCHASE OF ANOTHER LE CREUSET PRODUCT. IT IS SO CUTE AND I USE IT FOR DECORATION IN MY KITCHEN. I THINK I WILL USE IT FOR DIPS IF I HAVE A SMALL GATHERING, IT IS SMALL, SMALLER THAN U THINK. THOUGHT IT WAS MORE OF A MATTE FINISH, BUT IT IS ON THE SHINY SIDE. OTHERWISE, I AM PLEASED WITH IT, WHAT THE HECK, I GOT IT FOR FREE!! VERY CUTE, MIGHT GET MORE OF THESE??"
3,BLB-3 Original OEM Nokia,This battery did not do much better than the one it replaced. The talk time was never much over 2 hours vs. the advertised 4. This one and the one it replaced gave me less and less talk time as the months went by until it would start complaining after 30 minutes of talking. I am a heavy user and charge my cell phone several times a day. Have a Sony Erickson phone now and that battery seems to be doing pretty well.I would be real happy to get a phone with a battery 5 times as large which would actually give a talk time of 5-6 hours per day.
3,Indoors only,"This flag is far too thin and delicate for outdoor use. We will still make use of it indoors, but wish the description had indicated that it would not stand up to outdoor use."
3,could be better,"The message of this book, which is a study of John 3:1-21, is that being born again is entirely a work of the Spirit, as opposed to being by baptism, or by faith. I agree with this. The big problem with the book is the writing style. Far too often Best stops his exposition to quote at length the lexical entry for Greek words. This provides too much unnecessary information, and several times I lost track of his argument. Since this is a popular, not an academic work, such was usually not needed, and should be edited out in the next edition."
5,My Favorite Cartoon,"I saw Dixieland Droopy once a long time ago and liked it a lot. I looked for quite a while to find a copy because I didn't remember the name of the character or the cartoon. I was happy to finally find it on Amazon at a decent price. As a musician, I like the way it portrays the joy of a being musician and the fun of playing music. The story is good and the music is good. A real gem."
2,Insufficient Info,"This book may be a handy ADDITION to your publishing library, but it is definitely not ""the"" source book for marketing. In fact, in the rapidly changing world of publishing, I found that most of the information I did want to use was already out of date."
4,Gladys Aylward: The Small Woman with a Great God,"This is exactly what I hoped it would be-informative, behind the scenes tid-bits that are so fun to know about someone who lived extraordinary life."
1,don't be fooled by the cute cover,"This book is a clone of every other etiquette book on the market with slightly edgy cover art to disguise the fact that they still say you aren't allowed to tell anyone where you're registered. Etiquette is etiquette whether you're an anti-bride or not, and I suppose it's my own fault for thinking this book would tell me something different from all the others."
2,Not for the truly untraditional bride,"I received this book from a friend as an engagement gift, and was truly happy that I didn't pay my own money for it! I found the title to be pretty misleading. I am planning a small destination wedding, and am planning on forgoing many wedding traditions. I was hoping for some ideas on how to personalize my wedding and make it fun for a slightly offbeat crowd, and almost none of the information in the book pertained to me. Really, this book would be great for someone planning a large, traditional wedding, who needed a little reassurance that things like not doing a garter toss or a conga line were a-o.k. nowadays. I give it two stars because there are a couple of handy references, such as a tip chart for vendors, included."
3,"Good book, deceptive title","This is a fun, easy to read etiquette book, but there is nothing ""anti-bride"" about it. The advice in the book is no different from other modern wedding etiquette books, but it *does* present the information is a fun, youthful way with lots of charts, tables and illustrations.However those who consider themselves ""anti-brides"" should be aware that this book does push traditionalism and even big spending pretty heavily."
5,I wish I had this from day one!!!,This book answered EVERY issue I had wondered about! I really wish I had this book before I started planning my wedding. It is a MUST-HAVE!!!
3,"The Story of Cole Younger, by HimselfThe Story of Cole Younger, by Himself",He spends a lot of the book claiming he was not involved in various crimes and only admits to the Northfield robbery. If you did not know better you would think he was model citizen except for that robbery. The civil war referances were interesting but it was hard to follow them chronologically.
3,The words of the man behind the legend,"I only knew the name Cole Younger from the movie ""The Great Northfield Minnesota Raid"" and was happy to find his autobiography. There were some interesting facts I learned from reading this book, specifically about the times of the Kansas-Missouri sparring between the militias. I never learned that in my United States history classes. I didn't realize Younger rode with Quantrell, nor the bitter enmity between the various groups in that area, and the hideous retributions and miseries each side perpetrated. That was an eye-opener. Short read, interesting facts, made me give some thought to this historical figure."
2,not that good,to me the book jumped all over the map. found it hard to follow. glad it was free. but there was a few good parts.
4,Cole Younger,I always assumed Cole Younger was part of the Jesse James gang. He actually seemed like a decent human being not the cold blooded killer he is always portrayed to be.
4,Good First Hand Account,"I must recommend this first hand account of Cole's own story. It is not the only story but must always be the most important source and story of someone's life. I would have given this book a 5 as I would have several other books of this time period were it not for the ""out-of-place"" intro. Someone must have decided that it was important to censor and disclaim Cole's first hand account at the very front of the book. As I have done in the past, I taped these pages of attempted censorship together and noted to subsequent readers my advice on just skipping this questionable intro. Since my books usually get passed around a great deal I felt this was necessary to preserve the great and rare first hand account that Cole provided us of his life."
5,His Story,"This is a unique look at the life of Cole Younger. There are many movies and books about him and Jesse James. He makes a compelling case for what he did and didn't do and who was there when they happened. His style of writing is also very interesting. He had a high school education which was exceptional at that time. This is a great read for those interested in the Civil War era. I was interested because he was part of my family. In 1969 I asked my Grandfather about him since he saw him at the family picnics during the early 1900's. Mostly all he would say was that Cole Younger was there and ""We didn't like him much."" My uncle was a boy at the time and he heard my Grandfather comment; ""There's that outlaw again."" So you can see even in the family his negative reputation was well established."
5,History Lesson,"This book was a great history lesson for me. Not only did it tell a great story, it filled me in with alot of unknown information about my Great Great Great Great Great Uncle, Cole Younger. I would like to say that Jesse James and the Younger Brothers had no relation to eachother. THEY WERE NOT COUSINS. THEY DID NOT EVEN ROB BANKS TOGTHER. HISTORY BOOKS HAVE BLURRED THE TRUTH, AND I WOULD LIKE TO CLEAR THAT UP. please read this book, it is a great one."
2,Kind of slow,"A good effort and at times hits the mark, but overall is short of reaching the goal of being an interesting book."
3,I didn't do it,"He tells you, him and his brothers were never with the James'. He makes to many reason why he was such a good guy, when history tells you that he was with the bloodies unit for the south there was."
2,Nothing new,"I was somewhat disappointed in this book despite its endorsement by one of my business school classmates. Professor Tichy discusses already well known principles of leadership within the context of what is promoted as a ""new"" approach. Only a few individuals and companies are profiled and are used repeatedly throughout the book. The examples cited fit awkwardly into the message that is being presented. The title of the book attributes greatness to the individuals profiled based on only one attribute--a belief in teaching and learning. This seems such a narrow focus on which to base such accolades."
5,"All Leadership ""students"" should read this.","Noel Tichy ties together concepts of Action Sciences, Trust, and Accountability together in a method that can be duplicated in many leadership roles. His Virtuous Teaching Cycle may not be a quick fix, but is a culture changing concept that has served many business units well. Most examples are based on work at GE, but that is simply where Tichy's expereince allows him to describe reality, not theory."
5,"Starts off fast, and kept me on the edge of my seat.","I think this is a great book for young readers. There is no killing, but the main characters get hurt. This is definitely the best book I have ever read."
4,A very worthwhile book!!,"I like that 8 ball, and how it tells her the future and what will happen. Kinda cool when she goes for her friend and she's all knocked out and about to be carried off, like her other friend. The best doll was the jester doll, introduced it in the beginning, and finally, in the end. They also found the dead owner. WAY cool."
4,Great 30 minute Low Impact Workout!,"This is a great workout for a busy mom. It is 30 minutes long and it works up a good sweat. It also tones arms, legs, and waist. I would recommend it, especially for beginners who want a good workout in 30 minutes."
4,"A bit dated, but helped me heal.....","After being very ill from an auto-immunity illness, I was looking for something to ease me back into exercising. (My high intensity step tapes were too demanding.) I checked this out of the public library and was pleased with the progress I made while using it. Although my fitness level has increased, I find there are still days where this is just enough. If you're looking to prepare yourself for a marathon, this won't be enough for you... but if you want to add a non-threatening cardio video to your collection, consider this. You can usually find it reasonably priced."
5,Very good exercise tape.,"I have always liked Denise Austin and I have alot of her tapes, she is very easy to follow and and you always get a good workout."
5,Exercise video,So glad I was able to find this video. A video that is no longer available from many sources. Thank you so much:)
2,Disappointed,"This book consists of mostly catalogue numbers. I bought it with the intention of identifying my childhood doll. Guess what, she wasn't listed. I didn't even see a doll with a similar face pictured. It may have been there, but the pictures are in black and white and are quite small, so it's possible I just couldn't recognize her. The listings are extensive, but certainly not complete."
3,Effanbee A Collector's Encyclopedia 1949 - Present (Rev. Edition),"This book is very informative as to the history of the company and the dolls, but I did expect it to be more like the other doll books I have purchased. I was very disappointed that the pictures were not of actual dolls from people's collections done in color. The black and white photos of past brochures and salesmen's photos at the time was a big disappointment to me. I love to see dolls pictured in their original costumes and in color. That is something most of us love to see in a doll book. If I had run across this book in a book store and could have thumbed throught it, I probably would not have purchased it. Other than the photo aspect, the book is nicely done."
4,"Turbo version, better than the regular version","There are 2 great songs on this single, as a reviewer said earlier the song Pick Up the Pieces is a gentle song with Ben great on vocals and Olly brilliant in the background with his jazzy drumming.The Turbo Version of Whippin Picadilly has another layer onto the back part of the song where the drums kick in on the regular version. This makes it sound smoother and a bit heavier.Pussyfootin is the other song here, nothing special, very similar in feel to another b side Emergency Surgery with an almost middle eastrn style guitar over jazz style drumming.All of these can be found on Five Men in a Hut, so only worth getting if you like singles."
4,endymion spring while engaging lacks the richness of harry potter,"Endymion spring is a interesting story regarding a secret lost book containing all answers to all questions. Two main characters emerge, Blake the modern day child who is searching for the book and Endymion a child living in the 1400's who has hidden it. There are of course terrible enemies for each child of the story, which each child has to overcome. It is able to bring both stories to a satisfactory ending but never gives you more than a hint of what the lost book contains. This gave me a little bit of a hollow feeling at the end, as if the book did not quite fulfill its full promise. Still it was otherwise an engaging read."
3,Intresting buy if you have time to read,"This book took me a while to get into, and the way the story is set up gets confusing if you put the book down. However, if your the type to read books through and like things along the line of Inkheart then you will like Endymion Spring. Personally it was not wonderful but an enjoyable little read."
2,"great premise, poor execution","The idea behind this story is right up my alley, but I was disappointed when I finished it. The story had so much promise, but it fell short with many avenues unexplored. Some of the words chosen felt like writing for writing's sake, rather than trying to paint the clearest picture possible for the reader. The characters were not consistent, so, to me, they were not very likable. Particularly the mom. She had no character development at all, and her role at the end felt contrived and unrealistic - which made me mad because it was difficult to read all the way to the end.The author's intriguing historical note alleviated some of that, but only enough to go from one star to two. Much more time needed to be devoted to bring this story to it's true potential. It's a shame that didn't happen."
5,Endymion Spring,I am not finished with ENDYMION SPRING but I would surely reccomend it. When Blake finds a blank book that contains a secret- or feeds on children he must make sure the book doesn't fall into the wrong hands. But some of his friends may not last forever...
2,My least favorite read in years,"Subpar, not much filling (unfortunately). I bought this book for my son. He's fifteen, and it was recommended highly when I asked for a book to get my son reading more often. I had high expectations based on the lavish praise of critics as well. My son has struggled with this book for days now and finally gave it back to me unfinished. After reading this myself, I can see why it did not interest him. It's not very good, and it's often boring.Also I found it very predictable, and uninteresting. Overall, I've read better, and more original books. Yesterday I went back to the bookstore and talked to the bookseller who recommended this turkey, and she admitted to never having read the book!!!! I believe the same may be true of the critics (who I don't believe would recognize a sincerely good book if it jumped out and bit them on the nose).The only honest opinion you are likely to get is my 2 star rating. Do yourself a favor and skip this one."
1,Way overhyped and boring,"I had the same experience as the lady who had this book recommended by a bookseller who hadn't read it. I was told this was the new hot book, yeah, it's great--no, it's really not. It SOUNDS like a great idea, but the writing is ponderous and awful, condescending to the reader. The characters do not ring true, and the conflict, Blake's whiny angst over his parent's problems, is phony. I resent books that are foist upon an unsuspecting public with a ton of fanfare but that are really drawing hype from blockbusters like Dan Brown [see THE EXPECTED ONE, another genuinely crappy book]. If you are looking for well-written children's fantasy, see Cornelia Funke's INKSPELL or Elizabeth Haydon's new YA, THE FLOATING ISLAND."
2,Not impressed,"As always, a book comes out every season with more hype than the second coming. This is the one for fall, and it is truly undeserved. I read this with my book-devouring daughter, and while the plot sounds good on paper, we were disappointed in the actual writing and delivery of the story. The Guttenberg history is interesting, thus the second star, but the writer is heavy handed and his storytelling is clunky. There is no sense of building of intensity, and the characters are flat. I cannot say that the book is without merit--bibliophiles will like anything that has to do with magical books--but the actual story is overblown and hard to get to like, as are the protagonists. It's Da Vinci code lite, and my daughter gave up on it half way through."
5,This was great!,I loved this book! It has a unique feel to it as well as a great story line. The book keeps you quessing ever step of the way. The way in which the story laces itself together to make the whole story is briliant! I definately name this as one of my favorites!
2,Good start...,"This book reads like the halves of two promising books: The 15th century story is more gripping but unfinished and sketchy; Blake's story in present day Oxford is closer to a complete story, however, loosely weaved with perhaps too many characters who are shadows of themselves.Should the book be divided into volumes I and II with more of both the two stories, it would make better reading.Some of the descriptive passages (esp. those about the quality of the magical paper) are not so clear on first reading, which seems to indicate an older audience, while the story line is believable for a much younger one."
4,Great Book,Endymion Spring is a great book with amazing descriptions by the author Matthew Skelton. There are some confusing parts but overall is good. I recommend this book for boys 12+.
4,Loved it....didn't believe a word of it.,"This wonderfully creative adventure, taking place across time, had my interest until it left the real world. None of the descriptions/actions of the fantastic hold water for me as a reader. I went from deep interest in the historical aspects of the story, to disbelief.The writing changed pace about midway. It began with vivid and furtive accounts of deception and secrets, and then moved quickly into a ""let me tell you a story really fast"" type mode."
2,Bargain but Beware Mac Users!,"For $6.99 this product is a real bargain. I am working in the US for a few months so I brought my Go720 with me, European maps already installed.I bought this product instead of the download map from TomTom because of the price. However, if you are a Mac user it's not as simple to install. The product literature is Windows based, there is no option/advice for Mac users. The TomTom home interface is very different for the Mac and it took some frustration to get it installed. It does not allow the option to save the new DVD USA Map to the SD card, instead I had to delete my Europe map and replace it with the USA Map.That kind of defeats the object of having one device with several maps, but as I only paid $6.99 I'm not as mad as I would be if I paid the full price of $169.95!Now I have to figure out if I have to buy back my European maps again!Would have scored full marks otherwise"
1,"Don't buy TomTom product, their support sucks!","I bought this product to use with my HTC HD2 which already has TTN7 with Thailand map installed. The map in the dvd was for TTN6 so I downgraded my TTN7 to 6 but it wasn't compatible with the phone. Then I contacted [...] to solve this problem and it took several replies between me and them. In early replies, they told me to ""contact the dvd seller"" which seemed not making sense to me because this case was obviously about techincal. After several attempts asking them to give solution professionally, the last answer from them was to ""contact phone dealer"" claiming that they didn't sell TTN directly. If you're still follow me, this issue was cleary about technical but they tried to make this looked like selling issue.I'm really disappointed to TomTom, not by the product, but by their customer care. My recommendation is ""Don't buy any product from TomTom"" or you'd feel greatly disappointed if you have to contact them someday."
1,Very Bad Experience,The merchant said he is sending the updated maps and sent me a 2006 old version with a wrong key. Do not but any products from him. For no use i have paid the money to him. That s all i can say.
5,my favorite collection of pictures of marilyn,"of all the marilyn books i've, seen this is the best. shows marilyn at her most beautiful. milton greene captured her in ways other photographers could never quite match. a great book"
2,Keep DES separated from reality,"I am enjoying other DES books, but ""The English Air"" deals directly with politics and the start of WWII. It is impossible to mix the pleasant ""hammock book"" world of DES with discussions of concentration camps, Nazi war preparations etc. DES' world is one where the characters are already nostalgic for the good old days, and her Scotland is vaguely like LLBean's ""Maine""- fun but probably remote from the place ordinary people inhabit. It is not a world of politics and military action. Once these things are brought together, I found myself facing up to the hidden politics of all the rest of DES' world: i.e. her manly young British heroes go off to various parts of the Empire to fight ""bandits."" Some of these bandits may have been nationalist freedom fighters- but the point is, no one reads DES to get into these issues. ""The English Air"" makes them unavoidable."
3,OK Bio,"I enjoyed reading this biography of Marx, but I have to agree with the reviewers who claimed it was light on research. It also seems that the author disliked his subject and went out of his way to present him in an unflattering light. Otherwise, it seems to cover his life from the cradle to the grave adequately, but without brilliance."
3,A Mixed Bag,"If you have never read any biographical pieces on Groucho Marx in particular, and the Marx Brothers in general, you will learn a lot in this book about their lives. This does not read as an original work, however. Almost all of the anecdotal details are merely rehashed in this book for the umpteenth time. There is nothing in this book that qualifies as ""new"" information.One gripe about the book from an aesthetic standpoint: The pages are like sandpaper, and the binding on the hardcover breaks very easily, so be careful if you want to preserve its aesthetic value."
2,Wait for the Louvash book,"I agree with the reviewer who cited the erroneous info about Groucho's absence from the NY stage. Furthermore, in the same chapter, some of Groucho's most famous quips are ineptly misquoted; ................The absence of notes is particularly annoying in a bio that aims to be definitive, and the acknowledgements make his research seem skimpy in the area of primary sources. Also, the pictures in the book are the same tired ones Marx fans have seen for years.Far better researched is Simon Louvash's new book on all the brothers. Louvash is particularly strong on the brothers' European forebears and on their boyhoods; through diligence and common sense, Louvash destroys some cherished Marx myths. I picked up the book in England earlier this year and enjoyed it immensely. It is due here [soon]."
2,Medium Marx for New Book....,"I've been a Marx Bros. fanatic for over 35 years, and I have read everything there is to read about them. Mr. Kanfer's book is basically a rehash of stories culled from earlier books. His book is chockfull of apocryphal anecdotes and misquotes (how do these authors know exactly what was said behind closed doors?). The photos were also disappointingly familiar. On the plus side, I enjoyed some of his insights into Groucho's fragile psyche.For the real stuff I would recommend Steve Stoliar's :Raised Eyebrows"", and Hector Arce's, Groucho""."
1,Buy Hector Arce's book instead,"This book breaks no new ground, merely rehashes old old stories. Hector Arce's biography (Groucho) is much better factually and in its discussion of Groucho's inner life."
3,High Marx,"This is an entertaining book. I agree with some of the other reviews here that it is a bit light on research (it would have been nice to have more source notes), but it covers Groucho and the other Marx Brothers well without being exhaustively analytic. Like most comedians, it seems, Groucho was not a happy or a nice man. His humor seems to have come from a dark strain of insecurity and ego that grew worse as he got older. Kanfer does not try to gloss this over. One point this book does have over the 1979 biography by Hector Arce--it covers Groucho's last years in detail and details the results of the lawsuit between the Marx children and Erin Fleming, Groucho's secretary and companion.Fans of Groucho will also want to seek out the essay Adam Gopnick published in the New Yorker in March 2000.I also enjoyed both of Arthur Marx'es books about his Dad: Life With Groucho and Son of Groucho. Both of these books are now out of print, but well worth seeking out."
4,Definitive bio on comic genius reveals more man than mirth,"I've read a lot of books on Groucho and the boys,and this one will probably go down as the definitive word on Groucho. Kanfer shows a clear understanding of the man with the greaspaint moustaches, but what I appreciated most was what the book told me about the man over his onscreen persona. Groucho's lifelong parsimony and troubles with women are mostly brushed away in other books, but Kanfer delves into these topics here without being tabloidish. Of particuar insight (and sometimes heartbreakingly) are the early showbiz years for the Marxes and Groucho in his final years with the Erin Fleming situation. A solid read."
2,Groucho is sucko,"A bunch of stories you've heard before told in the driest prose imaginable make this bio of Groucho a chore, not a pleasure. I give it two stars only because at least I didn't find grammatical errors. ANY other book on the brothers is recommended over this one."
3,Can you count on Kanfer?,"In the second sentence of the introduction Kanfer writes of Groucho and his 1972 performance at Carnegie Hall: ""He has not performed in New York for some fifty years..."" Groucho played in Animal Crackers on Broadway as late as 1929. To call it ""for some fifty years"" can hardly be right. It makes me wonder: Is the rest of the book as badly researched?"
5,"A wonderfully talented and gifted jazz pianist, and trio.","Edouardo is an extraordinarily gifted musician. His trio epitomizes jazz. I just wish that EBT (Edouard Bineau Trio) music was more readily accessible here in the United States. Excellent work, BNT!!"
1,Pure crap,"Joke DVD. Why is it not authorized by the band, management, or record company? Cuz it is a horrid collection of interviews of clinger-ons of the band. Barely a few seconds of an old interview with Chris Martin...the rest is a bloody joke of nobodys. Do yourself a favor and avoid purchasing this item; I fell prey to it's trap--don't do the same."
4,A mystery...,"This book is a part of a series, but I didn't know that when I bought it.However the book only makes brief mentions of events from the past, so you never feel left out or estranged from the story.I loved the ambigious ending.Its written a for a young age group but that did not affect my enjoyment of it at all."
3,This book is about a boy whose mother died.,A Message from the Match Girl was about a nine year old boy whose mother died when he was a baby. As the boy gets older he starts to hear his mother speaking to him but he can't hear her too well. Then his grandma gives him a picture of him when he was a baby. The picture was taken in the park beside a statue of The Little Match Girl.So the little boy decides to go there. Then he starts finding clues and the story gets very weird.
1,Disappointment,"Farm ""girl"" concept is hokey at best. Ms. Butter's is selling this concept to market her products."
3,A Small Piece of Mary Jane,"I enjoy Mary Jane Butters writings - I suppose there is a place in my heart that is ""farm girl happy"" and anticipate her books and magazines. This particular offering arrived with a bit of initial dismay over the size of the book itself - so very small for the price. Even after reading the delightful material and playing with the neat inspirational magnets included, I still find it hard to justify the cost with the size - must be the ""farm girl"" calling out from me! Overall, this book with its lovely photography,magnets and recipes (which are delicious- I made them all, by the way) would make a great gift for the like minded."
1,Mary Jane's Farm Girl Wisdom - Cards and Quotes,"I was somewhat disappointed when I received these magnetic cards and quotes. I don't think they were worth the price. They were just O.K., I 'm sorry to say."
3,"Tiny, more like a greeting card.","I thought there would be more to this, even though the description indicated it was small, I didn't realize how small. It's really more like a gift/greeting card. I wish I hadn't bought it."
2,No Results,"I tried the product on 2 occasions with no results. A combination of pieces of lettuce, strawberries and peaches worked much better. Save your money."
3,Woodchuck trapping bait,I bought this a year ago. I remember that I did catch a ground hog. This year I tried it again without any luck. Other bait seemed to work better (live summer squash).
2,I am thinking about returning this product,"I was looking for animal friendly product because I don't want to harm ground hogs but I am not sure about this product.To be honest, I caught ground hogs by using trap without any problem with lettuce and apples.When everytime I catch these animals, I take them to deep wood and release them.I still have young one around our back yard but they are too young to survive in new location therefore I let creature to stay in my back yard until he (or she) get old enough to survive in new location.I am not sure about effectiveness of this product but when I have safe trap to catch gound hogs, there is no need for other product."
2,"too expensive, to catch a possum","Well, it probably would catch a woodchuck if a woodchuck could get in the cage, but it always catches a possum."
3,OK text...,Used this book for two different classes... book is written in easy to understand language and gives a pretty good overview of ed psych... liked the definitions in the margins as a study aid when it came time to review for tests...
3,GOOD BUT DOESN'T POWER SOME DEVICES...,After reading other reviews I bought the USB 7-port hub and was really eager to test it. Worked really well with all my USB devices except for my external hard drive. Had to use 2 ports out of the 7 as well as power the hub from the laptop (i.e 2 USB ports of the laptop also used) before it could power. But for other devices it was very okay. For the price I think it's a really good buy...
2,7 port hub,"Blocks both my USB connections to function. Does not work with my Webcam. I still need to switch USB cables when I like to use my webcam. Works with other equipment such as external drive, printer and mouse."
4,very useful overview,"In this small book Dr. Ferru gives a short overview of the essentials of living the right way. Perfect health depends on drinking water, taking the right fats, the right food combinations with the right nutrition, the right environment (feng shui and no electromagnetic fields) and a lot more. Things you will often neglect or forget (colors, breathing the right way etc..). Dr. Ferru has brought all possible subjects just into this little book to remind you what to do to live the right way. Just a pitty that he has kept most chapters so very short (with the big print the book is most readable and understandable for the layman, but I was hungry for more)."
1,"Uhhh, no.","Really lame and should be avoided. I do not know why Sega is intent to release all this [junk] for the Saturn, but it is not getting them anywhere."
3,A Strange Thriller,"From the back cover...""To all appearances the wealthy and talented Tylers are a fulfilled, happy family. No one would have guessed the streak of unsuspected madness that lay hidden deep in one of them. Then one day a young prince from the Middle East arrives, seeking medical aid and sanctuary among the Tylers - and the evil uncoils. Like a growing thing, an atmosphere of horror begins to wind itself around the family until it finally explodes in an act of violence that threatens not only the Tylers but the destiny of the whole country."""
3,Hollies,"Dissapointed in sound quality in several songs. I also got Herman's hermits DVD which was great.The Hollies were one of my favorites with The Beatles, Gerry & The Pacemakers and Billy J Kramer."
3,The Hollies DVD,"The dvd was not as good as I was hoping. Disapointed with it. Although, others in that series are fantastic."
4,Very interesting,"Of course I had heard the songs...but this well done documentary gives a much deeper inside look at the history of a well known band, it's members and their history. Definitely raised my opinion of the Hollies..."
5,ECHO OF THE PAST INTO THE PRESENT,I have read the USA reviews with interest. As a northerner Englishman I would like to present my review (on Amazon U.K). The Hollies were intrisically English who 'invaded' America. This DVD is an outstanding exmple of the two. I would urge you to see my review of 'Look Through Any Window' on Amazon UK for a local view.
3,It's Ok,"The first part does show a lot of examples. The second part may be interesting for psychoanalitic therapists. As a CBT therapist, it is useful to know the important contributions of the Psychodynamic theory. I think that besides the 101 concepts (which some I consider repetitive) the main idea well shown in this book is that subconcious material is vast and much more important than reasoned emotions and ideas. Eventhough it is difficult for CBT to aproach this, it's undoubtful that most of our actions are obscure and unknown.Ps. It's way more about subconscious mechanisms than subconscious defenses."
4,Good Spark plug wires,I bought A set of these for my 99 Nissan Altima very high quality wires and very good priced however they appeared used but very slightly used as if someone put them in there car and didn't want them.
3,Odd fit...,"The #1 and #2 cables are 3-4 inches too long on my '99 Altima, although the #3 and #4 are the right length. Not a huge problem, but kind of sloppy. The Altima never had a traditional coil, so the fifth wire is unnecessary. They do seem to work right, but I could have got cables that were cut right for less.The box was banged up pretty badly, from whomever picked and packed the order."
1,Plagiarism,"This book is a close copy of the 1917 book, ""The Indian Drum"" by McHarg and Balmer. Readers would be advised to go to the original book rather than read this rather tedious and poorly written copy of an interesting but plagiarized story. Even the characters have the same names..."
3,Let's give Mr. Johnston some credit for his effort....,"Sometimes the writing style did bog down and was clumsy to read. I attribute some use of this style to the era in which the story took place.I searched for other reviews on this book and found a review where Mr. Johnston admitted he embellished ""The Indian Summer"" written back in 1917. Why? The book is currently out of print and as time goes on copies of that book will be difficult if not impossible to find.If you happen to come across a copy of this book, don't be discouraged by the previous reviews. The story is very intriguing and will hold your interest to the very last page."
1,Rehash.,"This book is a poorly done editing of ""The Indian Drum,"" by William MacHarg and Edwin Balmer, which was originally published in 1917. If you are looking for a great adventure set in Chicago and northern Michigan early in the nineteenth century, then look for a copy of the original.As of mid 2011 (or perhaps earlier), The Indian Drum is available from Project Gutenberg at gutenberg.org. It even includes several of the original illustrations. I have downloaded it to my Kindle.The Echoes of L'Arbre Croche: A Tale of Murder and Intrigue on the Great Lakes"
2,"Moody, Stylish Period Piece","Donald Johnston has written thoughful, evocative novel of life, love and death on the Great Lakes at the turn of the last century. Based on the book, ""The Indian Drum,"" published in 1917 by William MacHard and Edwin Balmer, ""Echoes of L'Arbre Croche"" captures an era when men and women pitted themselves against the heartless inland seas in search of fame, fortune, or at times, mere survival. It is on one level a ghost story, and perhaps the ghost is that earlier more innocent age which is lost to us, as were so many ships."
2,Thomas Andrews: Shipbuilder,"Alittle hard to follow. For anyone interested in a book about Thomas Andrews or the Titanic I recommend the book ""I Built The Titanic""."
4,"Thomas Andrews - The real ""heart of the ocean""","This is a short read...too short for the kind of man Thomas Andrews was. I won't elaborate on the facts of the book but one of the things that came up a couple of times is, ""If he had lived...if he would have saved himself"". As you read about this wonderful human being, you will probably come up with the same conclusion - under the circumstances, he could not have lived. He would have been miserable had he been knocked out & saved. He could not have stood knowing that one woman or child had died because he was on a lifeboat & they were not. He went to the end trying to ensure that as many lives were saved as possible. Thomas Andrews was a remarkable man and I highly recommend this book to all Titanic enthusiasts."
1,Difficult to Read,"I was disappointed with this book since it is written in a style that is extremely difficult to read. There are too many commas and semi-colons to provide any kind of continuity. I own over 20 Titanic books, most purchased before the movie, and this is one of the worst."
3,An ok read,As much as I enjoy reading stories by Corinne Hold Sawyer this story didn't seem to be one of her better ones. It was an okay read but not the usual page turner.
3,the characters are interesting but the puzzle is faulty,i have enjoyed this series because of ms holts characters but i found the puzzle was simplistic and and easy to solve...i much prefer agatha christie for a more challanging puzzle
2,Wrong color,"I have used Egyptian PLum for many years. Lately I have not found it anywhere. When I saw it on Amazon I was very happy. Unfortunately, Burgundy brown in not plum. I will keep it to avoid the hassle of return. Thank you."
5,An Original,"I enjoyed this fast-paced, insightful story of a man whose independent spirit and voracious appetite for life, adventure and new learning set the standard for the open-minded, new-frontiers attitudes that came shortly after him. Hip before hippies, Kerouac's interest in society, drugs, spiritual and physical experiences packed a lot into his brief years. This documentary does a great job of evoking the man and his times. Interesting contributions by other ground-breaking, fearless figures: Burroughs, Ginsberg, Ferlinghetti. We need more like them."
4,The Queen's Soprano,I bought this for my daughter and was surprised how quickly I received the book and was in very good condition.
2,Not comprehensive or completely accurate,"I paid a fortune for these books and was very disappointed. First, I've had these books two months, and I've already discovered six factual errors. Interestingly, one show opened in 1978 and closed in 1976 -- quite a neat trick! Second, the ads claimed it chronicled EVERY musical produced in New York -- in fact, it includes very few off Broadway shows, even famous ones."
1,Zen?,"Zen is a word that the Japanese took from Chinese language. It is not an easy word, the semantics of the character are difficult even for the Chinese. Mrs. Murphey uses a deffinition from 'Chambers Twentieth Century Dictionary'. She does, however, acknowledge the use of the word in Buddhism. So, it struck me as remarkable that the first recipie in her book is for Pot Roast (the real thing--not gluten or Tofu). Therefore, although this may be a charming little book for some, I felt missled; and, as a vegetarian and great admirer of Zen Buddhism, quite dissapointed."
1,The Sleep Aid,"This book was required for my course on the Psychology of Women. I don't think i ever got past the first chapter. It is extremely technical, and so overly organized that it's like reading a detailed outline that goes on for hundreds of pages. If you are looking for a good sleep aid, however, just curl up with this book and you'll be out like a light in no time."
4,A little expensive but plenty of replacements,"For some reason unbeknownst to me, I _really_ like to drop and break these things. These seem a little expensive, but there are plenty to last even me awhile."
4,Good,"These are the exact same tubes that come with the testing kit, which is what I wanted. I was happy to see that. In general, I think these tubes are kind of delicate, but I think my expectations of them are too high. They probably shouldn't survive a fall from the counter onto tile ;) But the tip-over on the counter itself broke one and annoyed me. But I bought a test tube rack, so I think I'm good now. Shouldn't have any fall again :)"
1,-_-,' ' '''' '''' '' '' ''' '''''? '' '' ' '' ''' '''' ''' ''''''''' '''' ''' ''' '''' '' ''''? '' '''''. ''' ''''''' ''' '''''' '''' '''?? ' '' ''' '. '''''' ''' '' ''' ''' '''' ''. '' ''' '''' ''''' '''' ''' '' ''' ' ''' '''' '' '''' '''...
4,Read the description of the book carefully,"The book arrived according to schedule. The book was in fair to poor condition. Not the fault of seller. I misread the description. I got lazy. Generally, when I purchased used books, there condition was fair to very good. This book was fair to poor in condition. Pages were falling out or not attached at all."
2,Not what I've ordered,What I'd received had nothing to do with what I've ordered. A cheap version of a real pair of Body Sticks; not what was displayed on the picture. Disappointment...
1,Terrible,I really do not know what this product is good for. It looked great and I thought I can use it to massage my back.But the handle is so flimsy that I thought it would break if I pressed it against my back. Also the balls on it are so ruff that you can not use it rub on your muscles.
3,Body Sticks just OK,"Would not recommend. Product tries to imitate ""Bongers"" which are more expensive but unlike Body Sticks...the real deal!!Usually knockoffs don't live up to the original."
3,Mediocre,"The book is very dry, I was required to purchase it for a sociology course. If you have a choice, I recommend a different book."
1,Never sent Choke For carburetor,"I bought a carburetor from this company did not receive choke for carburetor sent 4 emails getting round around,So i had to go to a local motor cycle shop to buy choke and fix the carburetor $91 dollar carburetor cost me 30 for choke and 30 dollars to have carburetor fixed $151 dollars my cost now.I will not ,be doing business with amazon or this company again,I was a loyal amazon customer not now ,there are plenty of other places to to buy products online from."
3,Humorous,"A bit of humor and a mystery. Good story. Reminds me a little of Janet evanovich books, but not quite as good."
3,Hot Enough to Kill,"An appropriate title for this book. Paula Boyd makes her debut with funny, down-to-earth characters. As for Jolene, rarely does she make a trip home to Kickapoo, Texas, without some catastrophic event taking place. In this case, it happens to be that the local mayor has been murdered and her mother is on the suspect list. To top it off, Jolene is the center of much gossip at the local Dairy Queen. The personality of the protagonist reminds me a lot of Stephanie Plum of the Janet Evanovich novels, just without the gun. Sharp, witty, and frustrated with her mother, Jolene swarms through each day trying to keep her mother out of trouble and out of jail. Definitely a must read if you are looking for a quick and easy read that doesn't require a lot of sleuthing or thought."
4,good read,Enjoying this book almost as much as a Jovanovich. Jolene & her mom are a hoot! going to keep up with this series for sure.
4,Hot Enough To Kill,a bit of everything suspense humour and a bit of hanky panky. Keeps you coming back for more. Now waitng for next one in series
3,Too detailed,"Good murder mystery involving a wacky mother and her more stable daughter trying to fathom it all. Although the mother was a real ""character,"" her rantings quickly became a little boring to the point I couldn't get into it."
3,"It is okay, she has done better.","Not good but not bad, she has written better books than this and this one is eh, something if you have nothing else."
3,ho hum,Not as funny as it sounded like it would be but it was well written. I think if it hadn't been compared to Stephanie Plum novels my sights wouldn't have been set so high and I might have rated it higher.
3,Easy read,"It was easy reading, not a great plot. I would read her next book, I would recommed this book if you are not lookin for deep reading."
3,Predictable,not a bad read if you have nothing else to do. definitely not a great book but it didn't cost me anything
4,Hot is it,Main character Jolene is a little bit of everything. She seems to be insightful but can't seem to follow-up with her thoughts until it gets down to the nitty gritty. Loved it and left me wanting more Jolene.
4,Stimulating who done it,Very enjoyable book with great plot twists. Kept me guessing until the end. If you like a good mystery you'll enjoy this book.
4,REALLY GREAT,She keeps you on the edge of your seat! Will look for additional books by this author. Be sure to set enough time aside when you start the book - you won't be able to put it down!
4,Hot read,Hot and quick easy to read who dunnit. I found the main character very relateable. I enjoy these kind of light reading murderer mysteries in between heavier or darker stories. If you are looking for a good easy to read but still challenging murderer mystery I would recommend Hot Enough To Kill.
2,Not so great...,My book arrived in an alright amount of time...but it was missing so many pages...I literally had a difficult time following my professors in class. It definitely didn't note that it was missing pages (and important pages at that) out of the book. I likely would not use this again to order.
3,Good slipper but.............,"A typical slipper of this sort. There are a number of different animal varieties out there. This review is for the platypus.The only problem we have had with this slipper is that one of the ""legs"" came off after only a week or so of use. Does not effect the slipper itself, and it more a byproduct of the deign."
5,Awesome!,I made my husband a very happy man when I gave him these as an early xmas preasent. I had gotten him the sea turtle ones 5yrs ago and sadly it was time to lay them to rest. These I hope will last as long as the turtles did :)
3,Nothing Special,"I got this CD for free doing something at the Warped Tour show in Dallas in 2002, and it isn't bad. It also isn't good. It's mostly just forgettable. It sounds ok, but there's nothing that makes me want to keep listening to it."
3,like the other Warner Archives Collection Releases,"Positiv: The set contains 3 movies with now almost forgotten two-times-Oscar-Winning-Actress Luise Rainer which was born in 1910 in Germany and still living (!) in London (in Vivien Leighs former home).The DVD Quality: not bad.The movies are not bad if you like b/w, costume movies - and I like all 3.Negativ:DVD-R,not restored,no chapter menuno subtitlesno bonus"
1,Warning needs to be put up FRONT!!,"The Warner Brothers Archive Collections will play on very few machines. I have ordered the Louise Rainer Collection once before and sent it back because it would not play on any of our lap tops and only one of our TV DVD players. I finally discovered on the back at the bottom of the DVD box, [THIS DISC IS EXPECTED TO PLAY BACK IN DVD ""PLAY ONLY"" DIVICES, AND MAY NOT PLAY BACK IN OTHER DVD DEVICES, INCLUDING RECORDERS AND PC DRIVES].This warning needs to be put up front BEFORE someone purchases it.The movies are great, my favoite is ""The Emporeror's Candlesticks"", but you may have trouble finding a machine that will play them."
2,Inferior product,The seat has a very low and uncomfortable back and apparently it doesn't line up for bolting down for anyone.I would say the material holds up for about 5 months tops. Get a cover for your old seat instead.
4,So glad it's back in print,I've checked this book out the library so many times I feel guilty about hogging it (but I don't really care enough to leave it for someone else). It was out of print for awhile and I'm so happy I can finally buy my own copy. The recipes are dead-on great! The beef stew is better than Mom ever made it. Buy this book!
5,UNIQUE AND FUN READING!,"I have a ""Trillion"" cookbooks, and this one and her other cookbook, ""Beat That"", are my fabulous favorites. The recipes are sooooo good, and I have fun making her recipes to see if my family and friends agree. I had stumbled on, ""Beat This"", at our local library, and loved it. I wanted my own copy, but they must have been out of print. The library wouldn't let me buy it, so I accidently lost it, OOPS!! Then I got my wish, and bought it. A few months later, it came back in with fabulous new covers. I will be ordering these to give as Christmas gifts . These are alot of fun - buy them - and enjoy!"
4,Words Worth Eating,"There are very few cookbooks that are actually amusing to read straight through, but Beat This! is definitely one. An entertaining book to supplement any collection, the recipes for baking powder biscuits and almond triangles are yummy. The lentil soup is also very good if you add about a tbsp of curry, a pinch of cayenne, and a half tsp of cinnamon. The recipes are straightforward enough for a beginning cook, and are good, basic recipes for anyone looking for comfort foods. My mom and I fight over our copy."
5,I read it cover to cover.,This author is funny! And the recipes are great. I'm learning to be a better cook and I really appreciate how clear she is in her descriptions of what to do or NOT to do. She fills in the blanks.
2,Overrated - the author is opinionated,"I had read such rave reviews about this book so I bought it. The recipes are ok, but not ""great"". The author is extremely opinionated which is annoying. For example she writes ""I never use olive oil - I hate it"". Well, she's the only person I've ever met who doesn't like olive oil. Instead every recipe is full of butter. In case the author reads this, I'd like her to know that I'm replacing all the butter in her recipes with olive oil. There!"
3,"Some tight grooves, & rocks, but a drop-off in song quality","(3 & 1/2 stars) After three spins of the new Sugarcult disc, I'm ready to pronounce judgement. The first few tracks had me thinking they've fulfilled the potential of their excellent debut disc. They've got that hot pop-punk thing going perfectly, especially on the smashing hit-to-be, ""Los Angeles."" It's kind of a Cars-meets-Foo vibe, with some well-aligned guitar licks driving with some punk energy. But then at about song number five or six the CD sinks into a same-sounding rut, every song with the same tempo, the same verse-&-chorus structure, etc. The album redeems itself somewhat with the final U2-ish couple of songs, but that downfall in the middle section is pretty harsh."
1,Worst Album Yet,"I have been a huge sugarcult fan since start static came out. I loved both the first to albums and really looked forward to this one. When i first heard 'Do It Alone' I thought to myself ""what a terrible 1st single"" but i hoped that maybe the rest of the album would be better. I was dead wrong. 'Lights Out' is one of the worst attempts at a catchy intro that i've ever heard. It comes off as cheesy and immature. 'Do it Alone' really does not have any of the drive or emotion that a song like 'Memory' has and i cannot understand why they chose to not only release that song as a single, but release it at all. The only song on the album that stands out as half way decent is 'Dead Living' mainly because of it's catchy chorus which is reminicent of the last record. All in all, i would not recommend this album to anyone, they really missed on this one, and this is coming from a big fan."
3,Sugarcult - Lights Out,"Sugarcult lets loose yet another winner with LIGHTS OUT, their third full-length release. The songs here are frantically tuneful and intensely melodic, offering more of the great punk/pop found on their first two discs, START STATIC and PALM TREES AND POWER LINES. The music here is also maturing, though, as Sugarcult has added some flourishes that add moments of The Cure and ""Love""-era Cult. If you like Ok Go, Bowling For Soup and Fall Out Boy, make sure to check out Sugarcult."
5,Neat,Great idea I think you could handle Plutonium with these and not shed a tear! They are real comfortable too
2,Not a good fit,"I was really excited about these goggles, and was looking forward to cutting onions without tears... I was disappointed when they arrived because they didn't fit my face - I'm petite and probably my face is somewhat smaller? I'm not certain why, but the goggles wouldn't stay close to my face, there was a 1/2 inch space between them and my face which, obviously, defeated their purpose. I was truly sorry I had to return them."
2,Don't fit,The glasses do not fit tight enough to protect my eyes and if I leave my glasses on they do not fit at all. I will continue to put onions in freezer for 10 minutes before cutting. Works much better!
5,Life Saver,I have had problems for years with my eyes watering and stinging when cutting onions. I can now cut onions and not have to stop to wipe my eyes or stop because I could no longer see what I was doing. One of the best kitchen inventions ever.
2,Worked great until the side broke,"These glasses were perfect to keep the onion fumes out of your eyes. One day my daughter was wearing them, and POP, the side broke. No one knows what happened to cause this. I've since bought a Dewalt pair of glasses but she doesn't like them. There is no suction around the glasses.Maybe the manufacturer could make them a little WIDER?"
5,the best invention,"These glasses really work. Before I got them my eyes are so sensitive that they would start tearing within seconds of working with onions. Now I don't tear at all. They could be a bit snugger, but my head is small. Do not hesitate to buy this product. They're awesome and I love them. I highly reccomend them to anyone who suffers when they cook with onions. Suffer no more!"
5,They work very well,They work very well to stop the eye irritation. Keep them close at hand in the kitchen. Comfortable for someone who normally wears glasses.
2,doesn't fit,It doesn't fit on my Asian girl face. It will have a gap between my nasal bone (not sure how to call it but you know what I mean) and the glasses. but i still like the color tho (red) and for sure it won't able to fit if you head is big (caz my head is pretty small that I'm very sure of) :)
5,They work!!,"I have tried everything to keep onions from bothering my eyes (i.e., cutting them cold, breathing through my mouth, etc.) and the only thing that ever worked was to chop them outdoors--until now! These goggles work! I love them!"
5,WOW!,This is the first time I have ever cut an onion and not had any tears! I will be telling everyone I know about these.
2,Might have worked...,"The goggles seemed well constructed. They probably would have blocked out the onion, but they didn't fit my face correctly! Unfortunately, there were huge gaps around my nose that made these useless. As soon as I tried them on, I knew I would have to return them. See if you can find the product in the store to try them on before you buy them here..."
1,totally ridiculous,"This is absurd! I just saw this product on a local news report. ANYONE who has spent a little time learning their way around the kitchen can tell you that all you need to do to prevent tearing when chopping onions, is to REFRIGERATE your onions, and chop them when cold. Works like a charm."
3,Effective...but at what price?,They do the trick. Finally sweet relief from the burning eye irritation from chopping onions. But Buyer Beware: You will look like a complete idiot while wearing them.
5,Never chop without these,Cooking with a lot of onions over Thanksgiving and feeling the pain of onion aroma warranted the purchase of these goggles. Work great functionally... and stylish too. Recommended for the home chef.
5,Good Product,My Mom loves them. I bought them as a Christmas gift online for my Dad. He doesn't use computers at all.
1,Great while it lasted,"I ordered these in September of last year, 2010, and they are great products. My problem with these is that they are not durable. I have a very small head, however they are still tight. This is not a problem for me, but the plastic is already starting to crack badly. If someone with a large to normal sized head wears these, they will break quickly. I'd be better off buying swimming goggles. They won't break like this and will fit any shaped head. They'll also look just as weird, so I might as well save some money next time and just buy those. I'd recommend anyone else considering these think about the same thing."
5,onion goggles,Bought one for myself and another as a gift. Great product. Does what it should. NO more tears!
5,Just what I needed!,"I couldn't be more pleased than I am with these goggles. I bought them in pink but, they are still ugly. However, who cares because, THEY WORK! I had been using my daughter's goggles from one of her science curriculums which were hard plastic and too small. These Onion Goggles are comfortable and they work. One tip, you have to be sure the foam is up against your skin, of course. I use onions a lot and this has allowed me to continue in the joy I find in cooking and food prep."
5,"Corny, but practical","Who would have thought Onion Goggles would have been such a holiday hit? But they were. In fact, we opened them early to prepare the big dinner on Christmas eve.I bought them more as a gag gift but it turns out they are practical, they really work, and they are just fun to wear. Fairly pricey,(mostly because they didn't qualify for free shipping) but I am glad I bought them. They make chopping onions a lot safer.And no more tears!"
3,It's OK,"I saw this item used on a TV show I was watching, and having battled with onion fumes for years I had to have it. My eyes have always burned from the fumes so badly that I couldn't see. After using the Onion Goggles, I was disappointed. I thought the goggles would be right up next to my eyes, and they weren't. This allowed some fumes to get to my eyes. The onion goggles did not eliminate my eyes from burning, but they did help. I really wouldn't recommend my friends to buy this product. Probably some swimming goggles would work better."
4,Helps but not perfect,These are good at blocking about 95% of the onion juice. The green ones seem to fit a woman's face better; the tortoise-shell were a little large.
3,"""Onion Goggles""",I read the reviews saying these were a little on the small size and I have to agree. I feel like I have a regular size head but they felt too small so that they did not have a good seal and the fumes still got in and made my eyes water. Definitely would be too small for a man.
5,EYE SAVER,OMG! this is my favorite amazon find ever! I am very VERY sensative to onion fumes and these REALLY work!
3,Not a Waste of Kitchen Space,"We bought these glasses with hope that the they would prevent the inevitable tearing up that happens when one cuts into onions (and we needed glasses that matched my girlfriend's apron). What we found were glasses that did what was advertised. They effectively eliminated the tearing up around the cutting of onions. Yes, we could cut the onions under water, but we would not want to reduce the flavor of the onion. Also, the goggles provide an effective guard against splatter when standing over a cook top. In today's day and age, there are many one off items that serve only one function and take up valuable kitchen space. Those items are typically relegated to a kitchen drawer, never to be seen again. These goggles are always front and center in our kitchen. My only regret is this: These goggles are not one size fits all, so if you have a big head, you will not be able to avail yourself of what this item has to offer."
5,Great for dry eye sufferers,"For people who suffer from dry eye, these goggles work well in windy conditions. They help prevent excessive drying from the wind. The tortoise frames look more like sunglasses than do the pink and green frames. Cheaper than similar frames from the optical shop."
3,sounds like a good idea,"I always hate to chop an onion, but really don't like the way an electric chopper does it. These worked pretty good, but didn't fit my face as well as I think they should. My grandkids loved the way I looked in them."
1,doesn't seem to work,"I may have bought a lemon, but so far...1) Neither iMac recognises it as anything.2) A Windows XP system, after loading the software, sees an ""unknown USB device"" but can't decide what it is.Various reinstalls of software have done nothing whatsoever.I don't recommend it."
2,Disappointed,"Not recommended unless you enjoy frustrating tinkering!I have not been able to get the adapter to pair up with my HS820 Motorola headset and while the Bluetooth driver is able to pair up with my Motorola V505 phone, the Motorola phone tools software is unable to communicate with my phone using the Bluetooth connection.I believe the hardware is fine, but the software and user manual are terrible! Broadcom who is the real manufacturer of this Bluetooth part before IOGear sticks their name on it needs to hire some real software engineers!For reference, I am running Windows XP."
1,Terrible for Macs,"I bought this Bluetooth adapter to pad my order for free shipping--I thought it would be nice to use Bluetooth Headphones while I work on my Mac G5. And the packaging said it worked a. with Macs and b. with headsets, so you can imagine my frustration to find that it did neither. I was told by Iogear support that this model doesn't support headsets (confirming the error message I received), and even trying to sync it to my wireless keyboard ended in disappointment, so in the end I'm trying to sell it on Craigslist. If you have a PC it may very well work great, but for a Mac, and for bluetooth headphones, it's a total bust."
2,Girls Gone Wild: Spring Break Uncensored,"A lot like recent Girls Gone Wild videos, there seems too much of the video is spent on the bus or in a motel (hotel) room with a girl, or girls, giving close to pornographic performances, when they are removing all or most of what they are wearing. I find these part(s) of the video rather boring to watch."
3,Grils gone Wild,Girls Gone Wild: Spring Break Uncensored ... bROING lADIES ARE ALL RIGHT SOFT PORN . Lots of Pictures of bare chested ladies but almost no pictures of ladies lower reaches i like otoal nudity with a hint seduction this isnt it if its bare chested this is you if not dont waste your money this is the worst Grils Gone Wild DVD ever
2,Superb audio quality cannot save the music,"It’s no wonder this CD is used by many audio gear retailers who want to sell you a good pair of speakers. The sound quality of this CD is quite impressive and I have to admit, I was really impressed for the 2 or 3 minutes I spent listening to it while auditioning some speakers. But in that context, I was paying more attention to sonic details and soundstage than actually listening to the music.Although the tunes aren’t bad, the musicianship is certainly not stellar and the effects of great audio engineering quickly wears off. So much so that this CD is now collecting dust on the shelf."
5,"Perfect, I'll be buying more","I've been through at least half a dozen nets over the years and this is by far the best.PROS:No side openings. They just let in bugs and are impossible to keep closedExtra-long to reach from a high ceilingLarge, sturdy frame that breaks down easily to fit in luggageWell-made, attractive and durableCONSCan only be hung from the ceiling though I did find an easy solution for this.Screwing a hook into the ceiling is not going to be possible most places you go. Instead use three Command Adhesive Hooks. Stick the hooks on the wall above your bed in a triangular pattern. Hang the net from the top hook and rest the side-seam of the ""roof"" of the net on the other two to keep it level or tie loops of string to each side and hang these over the side-hooks. When you're ready to leave, the hooks can be taken off without leaving a mark. They also have replacement adhesive so you can re-use your hooks later. I've uploaded a picture to show how I did it.[...]"
5,Savanna Canopy Mosquito Net,This product was perfect for our needs. Fits a king size bed without headboard & foot board just as pictured. Ours has a bit of a head board and foot board it fit a bit snug with the extra 6-8 inches in length - but the bed is still accessable and it keeps the misquitos/bugs out.
5,no more mosquito or red ant bites for me!,can spend a lot of time on my patio instead of hiding from the bugs and the itches in an airconditioned space with no fresh air and only being able to look at the beauty outside.it's big and spacious and plenty long. let's in a breeze and i get to look at frustrated mosquitos staring at me and not getting it. aloha
5,Better than the Rest,"This brand has a slightly sticky surface and is the only one that will pick up sand. As you can see on [...] we live on the water and sand is everywhere. I often go over the floor first with a regular Spiffer cloth for hair and dust-bunnies , then go over again with the ScotchBrite Dry Cloths to grab the heavier particles like sand."
5,Love emanates,One of the best books I have ever read. To connect with Sunyata's LOVE overflow is perhaps one of the most enriching and fulfilling experiences you can live as you realize who you are.
1,Just a gadget,I bought this instead of one of the expensive flush products. I should have just not bothered. I used it once and I couldn't see any advantage over just draining my holding tanks and running water through them. It's just one more gadget thing.
3,Valterra F02-4100 45 RV Hydroflush,Bought this to use with the Flojet 18555000A Portable Waste Pump and found the flush valve leaks and a poor flush stream ... I don't know if it's just the one I got or they are all that way ?? ...found the one on the pump worked better ... didn't leak and a stronger stream for flushing .. I would of been better off just getting a plain clear one without the flush valve ... also it's on so tight to the pump outlet that I can't get it off .. I'm afraid I'll break it trying to get it off ... I already tried both separately on the camper outlet with no problem ..so it's the connection between the hydroflush and the pump .. If I were just using the hydro flush without the pump .. I think I would buy a different one ..or something different ..
2,pressure?,"Doesn't really work, doesn't use enough pressure to work. I can still use it to see if the water runs clear."
3,Works so-so for a quick flush,"This does well to clean what sits on the bottom of the black tank, but it can't pump in enough water for a good tank flushing. I upgraded to a Camco Dual Flush so I could fill the black tank for a clean water flush."
4,Love this product!,"This is one of the first and best purchases we ever made for our travel trailer. We used this device with all three of our trailers over the years. As with any plastic product, constant exposure to sun, heat, and cold will weaken the unit. With the Hydroflush, you will KNOW if your tank is clean. Use this in conjunction with a rinsing wand or some other mechanism for terrific results.So, why didn't I give this 5 stars? A suggestion for the company: I would give the Valterra HydroFlush 4.5 stars the hose connection would be more effective if it were metal as opposed to plastic."
5,Second generation.,"I purchased my Bucky twenty years ago when I was single and am now long married with a 4 year old son. I have and still love my Bucky, the cover is a slightly worn but has lasted beautifully. It lives on the bed like a stuffed animal. Now, every night, my 4 year old son and I wrestle to see who will get to sleep with it. Simply a great product that has surpassed any expectation I had when I bought it so long ago. Maybe it's time for a second?"
1,"Horrible, unless you are a Hobbit or 5 year old little girl.","This is the worst Amazon purchase I have ever made. I have nothing to say, other than this: The Bucky Utopia Neck Pillow barely fits around my wrist...not my neck! I am a 5' 7"" tall adult male and weight 160 lbs. I have several other travel neck pillows, and they easily and comfortably fit around my neck. I am not exaggerating when I say that the neck groove on this pillow is literally two inches wide. If you try to pull it apart to make more room, it just tightens the back part, and is extremely uncomfortable.How anyone can find a way to utilize this pillow is beyond me. I guess if you have a bad case of carpal tunnel syndrome it would be nice for a wrist pillow or something. I'm so disappointed...I bought this for a last minute trip and was really looking forward to using it. Maybe if there's an infant on the plane I'll give it to him. At least then somebody who can fit into it can use it."
4,"Overstuffed and overpriced, but comfortable.","I found it to be awkwardly thick initially, but after removing some of the buck wheat (as suggested by the manufacturer), I thought it was pretty comfortable. That said, I'm not sure it's worth twice as much as many of the others on the market."
1,More support w/ a dish towel!,"I'd give this zero stars if that were an option. I ordered this product to use on an 11 hour plane ride to Australia. To say I am disappointed is an understatement! I would get more nect support from a dish towel draped around my neck! It might be the right shape, but the product is flimsy & floppy....and this is supposed to give support....NOT! I will be returning this item for a refund. If anyone knows of a REAL neck support pillow for sleeping during travel, please reply ASAP!"
3,I lost my Bucky too ...,"After many years traveling with it, I left my older Bucky in a hotel last year. I ordered a replacement on Amazon but found that the newer version is considerably smaller. I have to admit that I think its too small.It may be smaller because some customers asked for a smaller version so they had less to carry through security and onboard ... but, sorry, the new version is too small for me. And I'm not a big guy."
3,Had such high hopes,"The Buckybag is made really well, and it comes in such delightful colors, I really wanted to love it. But for my neck it was too big and too stiff. I think neck pillows are very indivdual, either it fits you or it doesn't. The Buckybag may be perfect for you but it just didn't work for me. It also takes up a lot of room in the carry-on bag and it's heavier than I expected."
2,Not what i expected,"After reading all the reviews i couldn't pass up ordering this neck pillow i wanted something for good support in bed or when traveling.First of all mine didn't come with a buckybag as it says it does.2. the pillow is extremely loud to lay on if you move around at all.3. it was too small, not tight as some people complained but it didn't go around my neck enough it stopped half way. I'm a female 5'5. This would maybe fit a child correctly.4. I am returning this product the same day that i received it."
3,Good if you have a small neck,"This neck pillow is pretty good if you have a small neck. If not, another might serve you better. The covering is comfortable and easy to maintain. I wouldn't recommend this for travel, but it is nice around the house."
5,Indispensable!,"I had one of these in sage green for years, and loved it. I used it during flights, in yoga class, and for watching TV. I let my husband use it overnight in the hospital, and someone stole it overnight (someone on the hospital's overnight staff). I was really disappointed, but happy to see that they were still making and selling them... although no longer in my favorite sage green color. I got the current green... I don't like the color as much, but it is just as comfy. This is a great product."
5,The Best,"I have tried many products as I make regular overseas trips, nothing has been as good as this pillow, I find it makes me much more comfortable sleeping on the plane. Unless you can afford first class, this is a travel must."
4,great neck support,"This is a soft, flexible, yet supportive neck pillow that has made passenger travel so much more pleasant."
2,Shoe leaks,"Shoes are confortable, fit larger than expected, but no big deal. Problem is - they leak. On the first rainy day, I discovered my socks were soaking wet.Really disappointed. I have a Wolverine Oxford lace-up with no issues for 3 years. As these shoes are starting to wear, I purchased the Neptune as a replacement.I don't know if I can even return these as I only discovered the problem after wearing them for a week, not to mention I am looking at half the price I paid to ship them back from Canada to the US."
1,Disappointed,"I bought this in June of 2008 and now, six months later, it is completely broken. The base of the blade for the blender cracked last week and I wasn't too upset because I could order a replacement part and the food processor still worked. Now, it will not turn at all, so it is basically worthless. It had only a 90 day warranty and even though it wasn't very expensive, I would not have bought it if I knew it would work for six months and then break completely. I expected more from Cuisinart."
3,Webster's Concise Spanish Dictionary,"It is good in a pinch, but it is certainly concise. For serious translations a more powerful version is required."
4,Dead Man Falls by Paula Boyd,Dead Man Falls was a fun book to read. Paula Boyd's books remind me of Janet Evonovich's number books. Both authors are an easy read.
4,Another Fun Jolene Jackson Book,"I enjoy the characters and appreciate the fact the Paula Boyd didn't rush the two high-school sweethearts back into the lovey dovey stage without dealing with some of the baggage. The twists were interesting, the relationships believable, plus had enough humor to keep me stifling a giggle or two the whole time. I recommend you read the first book in the series ""HOT ENOUGH TO KILL"" first. After finishing this book on moved on to the third book in the series and I'm glad I did."
3,There's no Table of Contents for this book version,"I bought this book for a friend. And this version was picked solely because of the cover photo. Clearly this wasn't a wise choice.WITHOUT A LIST OF CONTENTS makes it hard to quickly search through chapters. My friend ended up with going to the library and borrow this book from another publisher in order to copy their table of contents and tailor it for this book.Plus, the HEBREWS CHARACTERS ARE IN PHONETIC FORM, which is also kinda weird, probably because the publisher does not support such font type or so. This helps to pronounce the characters but I'd rather they have the characters printed in as well."
5,great cd,deffinetly something to check out it is very unique and bizzare it is wierd at first but sounds awsom. if you listen to avenged sevenfold you should deffinetly check it out there drummer the rev does the vocal and synyster gates is the guitarist
4,Maybe the best choice for begginers in FP,"A very good introductory text for Functional Programming, witch uses the Haskell notation. Maybe made for those who came from some experiense in imperative languages, such as C or Pascal. Good examples, maybe not enough case studies. Another good reference is ""Bird"""
4,Good book for beginners,"Good book for beginners, not so exciting if you're an intermediate-to-advanced level programmer. Then again, it doesn't claim to cater to that level, so your mileage might vary."
3,"Mediocre Material, Awful Typography","This book may indeed be suitable for beginners in functional programming. Having had some previous exposure to FP, I found it very slow going, with tediously long discussion of trivial toy examples.Aggravating these flaws is the typography, which is not just ugly, but dysfunctional: The font used for the unnumbered section headers is not sufficiently distinguished from the text font, so it is impossible to skip over the examples to new material being discussed."
4,"Great overall, no need for other books, though Monads still ill-explained","Very good introduction to Haskell and functional programming in general. Covers Haskell's type inference system and unconventional syntax in a comfortable, clear way. Lazy evaluation and its effects on the language are likewise explained in an clear approachable way.There's lots of SICP-like exercises to practice with if you want, though their placement makes the book a bit confusing at times if you don't as it's hard to tell the exercises and the material apart sometimes.I haven't looked at competing Haskell books, but after reading this one, I don't see the need to. This book doesn't explain monads particularly well (though most other explanations, besides one explanation in a reddit comment I saw, are equally not understandable, so that's no great fault).Overall, a great book for programmers who want to get into functional programming or quickly learn Haskell."
1,Misleading In More Than One Way,"As another reviewer points out, the songs included in this volume that became hits for Webb were all re-recorded some years later. For example, there's no Red Sovine to be heard on track 5, despite the indication this is so in the content list on the reverse. Also, you won't hear The Wilburn Brothers on track 3 - Sparkling Brown Eyes, And yet both Sovine and the brothers were very much part of those two original hits!As for these being ""22 hits"" (they even claim ""22 greatest hits"" in the small oval just below Webb's picture on the cover) - well, tracks 13 to 22 were never hits - not even in Webb's wildest imagination.All of this could have been pointed out in the two pages of liner notes provided, not to mention on the cover of the disc. But they don't.Opt for a better compilation such as the MCA release Webb Pierce - King Of The Honky Tonk. This is just basically re-done junk."
4,Honty Tonk Songs,"Ordered 3 of Webb Pierce CD's because I wanted most of his songs..I think they are on the 3 CD's I bought..Always liked his voice and style of singing..Remember his songs when I was a young child,,now nearing 70 yrs old, but not to old to enjoy good county music...Amazon.com I think has any type of music you would want..Anyone who wants good Classic Country Music can find it."
4,Good Read,"Havent read much on the ""end of the world"" times. This is a great book to start with. I was intrigued from the first page and by the middle of the book i couldnt put it down. A friend of mine refered this book and I have already passed it on to a friend of mine."
5,Accurate and Breathtaking!,"This is the best End-Times novel I have read yet! While I was reading this, my best friend and I were doing a study on the End-Times. I disagree with the assumption of Adolph Hitler being improbable of being the Antichrist. I really appreciate the fact of the book being based in Israel as opposed to America in the Left Behind series by LaHaye. I have found in my study that not all the things that happen in the End-Times happen all over the world. Some of them will happen only in Israel. I have also found that as LaHaye thought the Rapture to happen before the Tribulation, I have found direct verses in the Bible stating the Rapture to happen in the Middle of the Tribulation. (Revelation 10:5-7, 1 Corinthians 15:51-52) The Last Trumpet is sounded in Revelation 12:15. I say again, this is the most accurate End-Times novel I have read yet."
5,Rivetting! An excellent study tool and great read!,"Robert Van Kampen has done an excellent job of integrating events concerning the last days and the rapture of the church. I was concerned by the ""Jewish Humor"" displayed by the ""Two Witensses"" but having read on I had to agree with them! Our God is truly magnificent! The novel will relate the events of Daniel/Matthew/Thessalonians/and Revelation into complete harmony without having to ""read"" into the scriptures any private interpretation. I highly recommend it as a novel that will reflect a more accurate view than that of the ""Pre-Trib"" sensationalist views that are out today."
2,Fourth Reich?,"I saw this title in an airport newsstand, and picked it up thinking it would be along the lines of a Tom Clancy or Dean Koontz novel. Unfortunately, the action and plot were not as well developed as I thought they could have been. The novel is more a summary of the authors belief/interpretation of biblical events, and comes across as far fetch."
3,End times novel that starts well then fizzles un-believably,"This book layed the groundwork well and I was sincerely impressed to see an End Times novel with the Pre-Wrath view. Unfortunatly around the eighteenth chapter the author has the Whole world bowing to a cloned Adolf Hitler (with the Same Name no less) and worshipping Him. It is a scriptural fact that the world will bow to a leader who will be the ""Man of sin"" or the ""Beast"" but the thought of the world bowing to Adolf Hitler as ""lord of the world"" with Swasticas and All is a little far fetched. The two witness of Revelation prophesied to be Moses and Elijah were reduced to a tongue in cheek ""groucho and Harpo Dialogue"" that left my jaw on the pillow. If only Mr. Van Kampen had finished what he had started so well."
5,"A really great couple of plays, will surely twist your head.","The author's terminal illness as he wrote these plays really comes out in what I see as his most powerful work. It reveals a clever blend of a hint of an autobiography with fears of our ""Brave New World"". The Potter style is unmistakable and unlike anything else ever done.Subtle hints at social progress paint a sad glimpse into our future if we let governments have their way."
4,good purchase,"This is a good pump, works well, no problems. The one fault is it dose not have a pressure gauge nor a provision for one."
3,Flotec FP-00L Shallow Well Pump Jet,We purchased the Flotec FP-00L Shallow Well Pump Jet to replace a another make/model we were using on our cistern. When attaching the PVC piece to the outflow side my husband hand tightened the fitting and then tried to give almost 1/4 further turn with a wrench to secure the fitting was on tightly. The black plastic on the pump split rendering the pump virtually useless. Disappointing.
5,Wonderful place to start!,"As a novice, I find the book inspiring and informative. Just looking at all the designs by other people and reading about how they got started gets me itching to dig out material for clothes. The instructions on rerooting, repainting, and reposing your doll are concise and well illustrated."
2,makeover what? learn from who?,This was so disappointing! All I can say is if you're looking for a book to learn how to do makeovers on your Barbie's THIS ISN'T IT! Please believe the review titled Lacking in information. I'm back to my search for a how to book!
5,Bold and Bright,"As a teacher of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd graders, I am always looking for stories that not only perk their interest, but also are filled with beautifully painted illustrations. This book not only entertains with its tale, but is a delight for the eyes. I look for Ms. Schanzer's books and am never dissappointed. This is one of her best! I would highly reccomend this delightful book to anyone."
4,so far so good,I will re-review this at the end of the winter to see how well it held up. In the past most grill covers cracked on me. This material seems to be better from the start than past covers so hoping this holds up better than most. It has an overall feeling of quality to it so I feel pretty confident it will last better than others. It fits very nicely and has nice velcro straps at the bottom. It has held up well to very strong winds we recently had.
1,Be careful,Had to return two of these. Both were ripped when they arrived even though they were supposed to be new.
4,Good quality!,I got this for a 3 burner grill and it fits well. The velcro straps hold the cover in place securely and it's stood up to fairly windy and snowy conditions recently. Very satisfied with the product and it arrived quickly from Amazon.
4,Usage,"Haven't had enough time to use it since received. Grill not installed as yet. However, it appears that it will do what it is designed for. Material quality looks good."
4,good product,"Was a little skeptical about buying this type of product without being able to ""touch"" it but is well made and worth the money."
3,Check the stitching,"Overall the material and size were good. I was happy and satisfied with this cover until after a month. While cleaning the cover, wiping the outside down. I noticed loose and overrun stitching. This was after the 30 day return policy. If you buy, check the seam stitching when received so if there is a problem you can return it."
2,Cracks,"I bought this cover (perhaps not the exact same size) a little over 2 years ago. In the discription it claims, ""Fire-retardant fabric offers UV protection and resists cold cracking."" Well after about 1 1/2 years it began cracking and tearing all along the top. The grill does sit in the hot Savannah sun. But it is obvious that the claim of UV protection is false. I would rather pay a little more money and get one that wouldn't have to be replaced every couple of years. I will say that if your grill is in a sheltered area, it might last longer. But they shouldn't make claims that are not true."
5,"Great grill cover, excellent price","I bought a commonly sold low-grade cover for my Char-Broil Commercial Series grill at a big-box store 2 years ago. The cover started to fall apart after 1 season, and now my grill has some rust spots developing due to poor weather protection. I read many positive reviews of this cover, and decided to give it a try. This is the best cover that I've ever seen, for less than a third of the price of the junk that the stores sell. It appears to be a marine-grade fabric -- very thick, with some weight to it. The velcro straps secure it to the grill very well. The medium size fit my grill perfectly. On top of that, the price is excellent. Why spend good money on an expensive grill only to cover it with a piece of garbage that doesn't protect it from the elements? Highly recommended."
4,Nice cover,"This cover fits nicely on the Sonoma Grill BBQ grill I got from Costco a few years back. The BBQ size is 23"" (21"" deep + 2"" more for handle sticking out on the cover) X 54"" long and 47"" high). From reading the reviews, I went for the Med size instead of the large and I'm glad I did. When installed the cover is about 6-8 inches away from the ground, so if you want the cover to hit the ground you may want the larger size. The velcro tabs on the bottom does keeps the cover on when it's windy. Only four stars because the cover is thinner than expected and not lined, but overall, for the price it's hard to beat!"
5,Great Grill Cover,"The price for this product was good, much better than any thing I could find in the department stores"
4,Good but not great,"This product actually does fit my grill--and the velcro closure is a good idea, though I still have to bungee the top part due to heavy winds in my area. The weight of the cover is good, but not great. It doesn't begin to compare with the Strathmore cover I got years ago. That was a really heavy cover that took the rain, snow, sun, wind and still lasted for years. I expect this cover to go about 2-3 years, max. But it's better than those flimsy covers for sale at the big box stores."
5,Excellent grill cover,"I was to the point of thinking there was no such thing as a quality grill cover without paying more than what my grill is worth. Since I have made previous purchases through Amazon, I decided to try this grill cover. Turns out, it is the best cover I have ever had, and I have bought several in the past. Although I have only had it a few weeks, it has been through ice, snow, a few hot days, and now rain (just love that midwest weather!), and it looks great. This cover is as good, if not better, than the high-dollar ones on the market. And as always, I'm extremely happy with Amazon."
3,you get what you pay for,"The cover was cheap compared to other covers I looked at. When it first arrived I thought the material would hold up well. But in the cold of winter the material began to crack and tear. If you live in a warmer climate, I suppose this cover would serve it's purpose well."
2,It Stinks,"I bought this cover for my new Weber Spirit grill. It fits perfectly and has good weight to it. I mainly bought it based on the good reviews it seems to have gotten from other reviewers.However, it smells REALLY, REALLY, BAD. I mean it downright stinks, nauseating even.I thought maybe the smell would go away but it hasn't. I had left my Weber manuals inside my grill and some new BBQ tools which i decided to bring inside. Even the manuals and tools stunk.I can't believe more people haven't written about this. I have no choice but to throw this cover out and I'll be buying a Weber grill cover and hope to God it also doesn't stink or at least not as bad as this."
1,MR BAR B Q GRILL COVER,THIS WAS RECOMENDED WHEN I ORDERED MY MECO GRILL. IT WAS REALLY TO BIG. SENT BACK FOR REFUND. HAD NO PROBLEM. GOT ON MECO AUSSIE WEB SITE AND ORDERED THE GRILL COVER THAT WAS MADE FOR IT.FIT PERFECT.
1,Not crazy about the material,This cover seems more like plastic than cloth. It is very tight for the measurement. I guess I'll just live with it.
5,Fits My New Weber Q 320 perfectly!,"After reading the reviews for the Weber Q 320 cover, I learned it was Great, EXCEPT for having to fold down the side panels on the grill, and being a little short in length.Not to mention, with the Weber logo on it, my grill would be a perfect target for theft in my apartment complex.So I bought the Mr Bar B Q Platinum Prestige Medium cover, and it fits perfectly. I Love It!Seems heavy and extra durable, No logo, Length covers the wheels, and it covers the Q320 with the side panels extended. Also I'm able to keep all my utensils on the grill hooks.It also shapes to the low profile Q 320 grill, very nicely. With no excessive ""square shape"" on top.Only negative: It does cost $10 more than the Weber cover.Who Cares!God I'm a Smart Buyer!"
3,Size is inaccurate,"The measurements given are totally inaccurate, as implied by another reviewer. In particular, the length is 50 inches max, not 59. I bought this for a grill that is exactly 48 inches long and I have to yank on this thing with all I have to get it to fit. Also, the warranty sounds great at lifetime, but it has so many exclusions and requirements that it is virtually worthless. The material is better than most but is still fairly thin and I wonder about its longevity."
3,expecting more,"Was expecting something more heavy duty; don't expect it to last more than two years; the previous one we had lasted 4 yrs and was heavy duty compared to this one but then was more expensive, so got what i bought for the price."
5,instant classic,"the chemistry in this ensemble is truly bonkers but oh, how we benefit. this show is bound to become a syndicated classic akin to 'seinfeld', 'frazier' & 'will & grace'. gets better with each repeat viewing. outtakes extras is not to be missed..."
1,Not Studio 60...............,So why are the Writer's Guild on strike? I can only assume it is because witty funny intelligent shows like Studio 60 get cancelled and they are forced to write for stupidity like 30 Rock......
1,Underwhelming letdown,"I got to watch this show after it came out on DVD, and I honestly tried to give it a chance, especially after hearing all the rave reviews about ""30 Rock""'s being a ""smart comedy,"" yada, yada, yada (to paraphrase the apex of genuinely smart comedy, ""Seinfeld""). The series dramatizes the production of a network sketch comedy series, and features Tina Fey, who was a writer and star of ""Saturday Night Live"" during some of its least funny years. Fey's whole snarky routine in this show is really tiresome, and I don't think she has the personality to sustain an entire sitcom. In fact, if you want to cure overpopulation problems in the world, you can start by putting her picture on billboards and other signage to help dampen all libidinal interest. Perhas Fey can find greater success among the other unfunny comedians who have turned to political commentary, such as Jon Stewart, Al Franken, Bill Maher, and Janeane Garofalo."
3,What the what?,"Well, at least I got the main thing.But I was really expecting the whole shebang.the boxset casing, and y'know, just the whole ""BOXSET"" feel.I just got three DVDs in seperate cases like it came out of a library..."
4,Light and enjoyable,"Nice sitcom. Funny in an elegant way. My daughter, who is 17, found it outright hilarious. Perfect for the hard-core Obama crowd"
5,"Perfect for fans of ""The Office""","""30 Rock"" is undoubtedly one of the most refreshing, wittiest comedies to appear on the roster this season. Tina Fey and Alec Baldwin have perfect banter-like dialogue, invoking humor that is subtle but, if picked up on, will leave you laughing throughout the entire episode. It's clever and dry like ""The Office"" but with a bit more energy. All of the other characters are wonderful as well, and you will learn to love each of them for their hilarious quirks and mannerisms that make this show so fantastic. The plot is never boring (though a few episodes dragged somewhat) and is always something unexpected. Highly recommended!"
4,A good but not great comedy,"This show is really good, it's well written, funny, has memorable characters, but I personally don't think it's a ""great"" comedy. It doesn't have the emotional strength that newer shows like Modern Family mix in with the humor. Overall though I decent enough comedy that certainly does rise above 99% of the other scripted shows. Looking forward to seeing if they can convince me with following seasons."
2,"Good show, but far away from being the best...","Althoug this is a solid show (thanks in great part to Alec Baldwin's talent and charisma), there's no way I can undertand it having won so many Emmy's and other nominations as best comedy. No way.This is a conventional show by all accounts. It has absolutely none of the wit, the boldness, the intrincacies of the plots of a ""My Name is Earl"", for example. Heck, ""Two And A Half Men"" and even ""The Big Bang Theory"" are outright more fun, more clever, more dinamic.I bought this first season without watching any episode on TV, base on the high remakrs it obtained. I was utterly dissapointed, but, as I said before, the show itself is good. It's just not nowhere near greatness."
2,"One star for Baldwin, one star for impressing award committees","I tried, I really did. The first season, I tried three episodes and just couldn't stand it. I give it a star for Baldwin because as hard as it is to admit, every Baldwin is talented - whether hilarious comedy or drama or action, I enjoy them all - most of the time. The other star is for being so good at impressing the award committees. Whether it's because everybody knows everybody or because they make the kind of funny that the elite media types like or they made a deal, I do not know, but they deserve a star for being able to beat some of the best shows on tv without having to be one of the best shows on tv. That takes talent - or something. Sorry but it just doesn't compare, not even the same league as The Office, Big Bang, Pushing Daisies (more a comedy within a drama, I guess) and so many more. I tried after they won all the awards to watch the second season and it was worse than I remembered."
3,Not funny at all,"I bought season 1 after reading positive reviews and seeing one of the episodes on a transatlantic flight. Also I'm a big fan of Alec Baldwin.I have to admit I was disappointed - the show is not funny at all, no good jocks, it's often boring.Smart ? Sometimes. Tina Fey is not a great actress, I'm sure she is much better at something else.I was disappointed by Baldwin too - seems like his role in this show is some extension of the ABSOLUTELY the same character he played in Will & Grace, except that this time that character didn't fit in well with other straight characters."
3,Too many 30 Rock,"The site was confusing and I ended up ordering two of the 30 Rock. Rather than return one and pay postage, I gave the second one away as a gift. Next time, I need to better understand the site."
2,Not for everyone,"After reading multiple good reviews I picked up the season only to be monumentally dissapointed. The show has a few laughs but they are generally over-the-top humor that tends to fall flat on any introspection. I will admit I was never a fan of Tracy's humor... but now I abhor him as an actor, he is terrible in this.I saw many people calling this show smart and frankly I never saw that.... If you see this show in the bargain bin somewhere for 5 dollars then I might recommend it.Save your money and buy anything else."
1,Inane,"I didn't see ""30 Rock"" when it was on TV and I thought I'd have a look at the DVD since the series had good reviews, was popular, and since I had admired Tina Fey's work on ""Saturday Night Live."" My attention lasted two episodes, during which I didn't see anything that was mildly comedic. There's comedy and there's silly; ""30 Rock"" is silly.In total, it had the feel of a cheap, shallow sit-com, with what was intended to be snappy patter, a silly looking character in the ensemble company, and perceptible pauses and meaningful looks to tell us when to laugh. I didn't. And I didn't feel that I could waste any more time on it."
1,Not impressed,"We live overseas so ordered this show ""blind"" due to the high reviews. Neither my husband nor I are impressed with the show. It has rare moments of humor, but I will not be buying the second season."
4,"Innovative, but inconsistent, still above the pack","First I applaud everyone making the show for thinking outside the box. The plots vacillate between an absurd fantasy world to a more grounded reality show. Baldwin stands out as the long suffering boss who has a soft spot for Liz Lemon, even though he thinks she's a bit of a loser in her social life. Kenneth the Page is another outstanding character. He's the naive and loyal NBC page who gets caught in everyone's dysfunctional plots. Like Seinfield, some plots work and others don't. Still the show always has some good one liners. I don't know why people don't watch it. Also a shout out to the Pager King, Liz's on and off man."
5,Really Funny,"30 Rock is a great show that has won many awards. Alec Baldwin and Tina Fey make a great duo, and the other characters are great. The show has tons of cameos as well, including LL Cool J, Jerry Seinfeld, and Rip Torn. There are some extras and outtakes, but not as many as I would want. Why buy this when you could download the series on NBC? It plays easier and you can watch it on your TV."
5,Blerg,"My husband and I absolutely love 30 Rock, so naturally we love having season 1 on disk to watch anytime we want! We also can't wait to get the other seasons on DVD!"
5,I love the show!!!,"I am not that into American comedies nowadays. My husband tried to make me watch ""arrested development"", ""The simpsons"", etc. But I just can't make myself like them. They ARE funny shows, don't get me wrong. But I just can't watch a show while not liking any of the characters in them. To me it's like that hollywood is trying to promote the ""mean"" as if it's the new ""cool"".""30 Rock"" proved that we CAN make a real comedy without making it mean or evil!!!"
1,Dumb,"I like the independent films so i thought id give this one a buy this dvd has statements like "" Im gangster this im gangster that..please buy my new album im so real i only hang out with -real- people""..etc all hollywood hip hop lingo' theres no raw fighting just one kid being initiated 'i think' by two guys who swing like girls and thats it. the whole video is just mostly girls dancing with a song in the background all in all its a pretty dumb and i regret buying it..im buying part 2 so i hope that ones better but the person who made this one is going to need constructive surgery on his rear end after pulling this one out from there im sure, lol.anyways everyones opinion is different and one mans trash is another mans treasure so you be your own judge. i just didnt like it."
1,Need to have a Warning,Very dissapointing. Cannot be run on Windows XP. Have not been able to download to try. Forget this one unless you have Windows 95. Waste of money.
1,Totally disappointing,"Although this product cushioned the heels, it pulls down my socks thereby creating foot blisters where the sock doubles over. I was constantly having to pull the socks up but it was a loosing battle. It was most evident when using them in my running shoes but the same thing happened in street shoes."
2,Heel Cups,these heal cups are bulky and don't fit right in your shoes. i don't feel they added anything for my heel pain
2,did nothing for my plantar fasciitis,"after reading the reviews on amazon, i decided to pick up 2 pairs for my horrible plantar fasciitis..wore them yesterday and all they did was squeak loudly in my closed shoes, and did nothing to alleviate my heel pain..however, i am happy to say that the ""foot rubz foot massage ball"" did a whole lot and makes up for the money i wasted on these..will try to return these as they are useless..."
3,Better but not perfect,There are reviews that this product solved the PF problem of some people. I walk a lot. It helps a bit but is certainly no cure. Better than nothing though.
1,No support.,This will not support you plantar fascia. If you have plantar fasciitis don't buy this product. I am planning to return it.
2,No good for my heel pain,"I bought these because of a nagging heel pain. At first, they felt just different, with most of my weight on my heels and no instep support. By mid-day, my painful heel was worse than ever and I removed the Tuli's. The next day, my heel is still more painful than before - - the Tuli's actually worsened my particular situation.They are nicely manufactured products of good material, and for a simple heel lift I think they'd be fine. But it appears that what I need is to remove weight from my heel, not add to it."
3,UPDATE: comfortable BUT...,"I received these this morning and wore them several hours at work today. They are very comfortable but I have two issues with them. One, they pull my socks down like another reviewer. And I'm wearing fairly new socks. Two, they push my toes against the inside of my shoes as I walk. Not painful for short walks but I don't like it. Maybe it's my shoes; I will try them in other ones and report back.UPDATED June 23, 2010: Well, I tried these in another pair of shoes. Same experience. I'm wondering now if maybe they are too large. I ordered according to size but I may need to try smaller. They feel really good on my heels otherwise."
5,Definitely worth it!,"I've been suffering with severe plantar fascitis since I got pregnant. Tried a different kind of heel cup with no relief. Tried these and only after two days of wearing them all day in a good running shoe I have noticed MARKED relief!!! Today is day # 4. I didn't wear them yesterday, just to see how my foot felt and I barely limped all day! Sometimes not at all! Holy cow do I feel relief! I think the weight specific heel cups helped alot too! Try them. I did have to trim the top off as they were very ""bendy"" putting them on at first. Quick trim job did the trick and now I am VERY happy!"
3,Moderately helpful for plantar fasciitis,"These heel cups provided some relief from plantar fasciitis pain, not terrific. I found they were not as effective as HTP heel cups."
5,All Day Comfort,Both my wife and I love these heel cups. I originally bought them to help with plantar fasoitis. They did a such good job that my wife swiped a pair and she loved them as well. We will buy these for every pair of shoes we own!
2,didn't work for me,"wanted to love these and at first they were comfortable if not a little awkward the way they fit in my shoes. by the end of the day, however, they had pushed my feet to the edge of the shoe causing bruising and soreness on my toes."
2,Disappointed,"This item did not seem to help my heel pain and takes up a lot of room in my shoe. I was very disappointed to learn they cannot be returned. My podiatrist said he has seen very few people be helped by this type of device unless the pain is under the heel. Mine is in the back of the heel and I bought them at the recommendation of the physical therapist, who was treating me."
3,Heel Cups Review,I found this product to be helpful in reducing the high impact to my heels and the pain associated with it.
3,Not the answer to my heel issues,I tried these heels based on the reviews. But they weren't that comfortable. I wore them a couple of days but winded up putting them aside. They kind of kept my heel to high.I was afraid my knee would give me a problem if I kept wearing them. Oh well I tried.
3,Don't seem to make a difference,"I use these in my normal work flats, and really don't feel a difference... They might be working, but they are kinda light and not really gel feeling.. Wouldn't order again, I need more of a bounce to help with my heal spurs!"
3,very comfortable,"These heel cups are VERY comfortable. However they provide zero arch support so if the arch is causing your problem, these are not the answer. I found they work very well with arch support insoles."
3,"Good for dress shoes - not for sneakers - alters gate, which can affect knee","Good for dress shoes - not for sneakers. For me, sneakers already have a lot of cushion. But dress shoes don't have much padding and aggravate my achilles tendonitis. These Tuli's gel heel cups are much better than what I have bought previously at a drug store. I have 10 1/2 mens size shoe and the regular size was a good fit.--UPDATE - Lowering to 3 stars - I have also been having knee problems. I read that anything that changes your gate can potentially have a bad affect on your knee. With this product your heels are pushed up about a quarter inch. It is almost like wearing heels - which feels weird for a guy. I stopped using the product because my knee issue became more problematic than my achilles tendon issue."
2,Disappointing,"I have had heel and foot problems for years. I was hoping this product would help. Unfortunately, because this product is thick and difficult to control in your shoe, it's not very useful. Trying to run with these in your shoe is almost impossible. It slips around too much and is so thick your heel rides too high."
5,Fantastic!,"I use these in conjunction with the Pinnacle Powerstep insoles and they work great. I get awesome arch support and now great heel cushioning as well.These heel cups don't rotate around (like other brands I've reviewed), they stay firmly in place, they don't pull my socks down (like another reviewer mentioned, maybe I just have new properly fitting socks?), and I like the feeling of the waffle pattern crushing under my heel when I walk."
5,pediatrician,"I am a pediatrician and bought these for my 12-year old daughter who was having heel pain (Severs Disease) playing basketball. An orthopedist once recommended to me that I should only recommend ""waffle"" heel lifts. Since I bought these for her, she has not complained of any heel pain. The gel inserts sold in most drug stores slip in the shoe and are generally worthless."
2,"Large for the large foot, not weight","I purchased the large heel cup & it is too big for my foot. It recommends for over 175 pounds, but it should be sold by shoe size. I have had the regular heel cup by Tuli's & have had good luck with them, but I thought the large would provide even greater cushion. Not so, it just bunches up in my shoe, definately for a large foot."
2,It didn't work for me.,"Tuli's Heavy Duty Gel Heel Cups, didn't work for me. I have heel pain and when I put a heel cup in my shoe it hurt even more. I need to go to an MD to find out what the pain is from. People keep telling me it's a heel spur, but I don't think so. #1 go to a Doctor first before buying them."
5,Loving these squooshy heel cups,These heel cups help keep me going. I think they would make anyone with any kind of foot discomfort feel better.They are more springy than the regular tuli's and I do like how they make my feet feel in shoes.
3,Feels good but squeaks when walking,"This product feels GREAT when you walk. However, there is a squeaking sound whenever I walk, especially when wearing them in my slip-on shoes. The sound is somewhat embarrassing, therefore, I don't wear them."
5,Actually Worth Buying,"When you are in pain, it is easy to be convinced by ads for products that say they will help you. As such, I have piles of shoe inserts that I was hoping would protect my heels long enough for my Plantar Fascia to recover fully. None provided enough cushion to keep from re-injuring or aggravating my foot. These actually worked. They are surprisingly shock absorbent without throwing off your balance or allowing your foot to destabilize. They are easy to move from shoe to shoe, but at the price I am thinking of buying them for all my shoes so I don't get lazy and go without them. I got the large size because I wanted all the waffle I could get, but they fit just fine in my size 8 boots. Relief!"
2,Recommended by doctor,My daughter's doctor recommended these for shoes that didn't have built in gel or air packs in the heels. (Though the doctor said my daughter was wearing good shoes.) My daughter does not report a lot of relief when wearing the hell cups. She also mentioned that they make weird noises when she walks in the hallways at school.
4,Charming Christmas Book,"This book is a companion to the PBS holiday TV special ""Christmas in the Heartland"" with Marcia Adams (I think it aired back in 1992.) Four different families are visited each sharing authentic holiday celebrations from 4 different time periods. A pre-civil war farm house, a Moravian holiday, a Victorian Christmas, and a contemporary holiday party are highlighted. Each family shares their authentic recipes, decorations, and traditions. This book is lovely with full color glossy pictures throughout. I especially enjoyed the Moravian traditions because I live near Bethlehem and have always loved the Moravian recipes and decorations during Christmas. I have only made one recipe/craft to date but I love to page through this book while listening to Christmas music to put me in the holiday spirit."
1,Disappointing; nowhere near as good as its predecessors,"I was very disappointed in this book. The recipes and crafts didn't seem nearly as well perfected as in the authors other books. For example, applesauce cinnamon ornaments did not include glue (which makes them much sturdier, smoother, less breakable, and resistant to bugs). Had the author done any checking whatsoever, she would have learned this -- but seemed more eager in rushing to press than in perfecting the recipes/projects. I was very disappointed."
1,"Sounds Awesome, Box Art Looks Awesome, but Game is Not Awesome","wow I really wish this game was good I mean it looked like it was gonna be amazing. great game name, great box art and a hopeful story. 2 bad the gameplay and just about everything else was crummy. avoid at all costs. 1 star."
2,Doesn't Best Represent His Talents,"I picked up this CD a few years ago, namely for the track ""Bring it on Home."" Because this was the only Charlie Rich music I was familiar with, it took me many years to discover that many of the tunes on the album, especially his earlier works like ""Mohair Sam"" and ""Lonely Weekends"", are not the original hit songs, but re-recordings done, apparently, years later by Rich. While still good, they're not the versions that brought him to fame, and all have this generic ""countrypolitan"" feel to them, short-changing the listener on how diverse his catalog actually is. While this isn't a bad album, it's not the one that best represents his talents. I suggest, instead, ""Feel Like Going Home: The Essential Charlie Rich,"" a double CD that offers a glimpse of his rock'n'roll, jazz and country leanings, not to mention the excellent, informative liner notes. Get his ""20 Greatest Hits"" if you find it somewhere for less than $3 at a cut-out bin."
