5,Required Reading for Voters,"This book stays memorable after having read a number of books on voting and political theory. This is the BEST book on the US's presidential debates. Farah provides a shocking picture of the bizarre rules participants must adhere to. Your jaw drops further at the corporate and lobbyist entrenchment. But most appalling is the energy that the commission (with Republicans and Democrats) dedicates to barring voices outside the two parties. This book is thorough, yet easily manageable in its length. Don't be surprised if you finish it in one long sitting.Do yourself a favor. Let Farah enlighten you with No Debate."
3,Melodramatic Louisa,"The telling thing for me when reading a book is that if I put it down and don't go back to it for over a week, it must not be that good. And when I look at it and then choose to read something else I know it's not a good book.The story takes place in Boston, Concord and surrounding areas is interesting only because I grew up there.Susan is the fictional friend of Louisa Alcott and together they go off as nurses at a Civil War hospital. Mildly interesting but very flat, predictable characters throughout. Lousia fall in love with one of the soldiers who then disappears.The glory cloak is a gift to Lousia to empower her to better writing. Alcott struggles with writing and publishing and Susan is there to encourage her and cheer her on.To sum up, Louisa is a mediocre writer who managed in her life to write a few entertaining pieces and then forevermore yearns for fame and in her melodramatic way believes she deserves it"
4,hot hot hot,i cant tell you how hot this lil thing is.... just wish it wasnt so darn expensive.... alot of mulah for little fabric
2,I already reviewed one of these ..,guys. Don't buy. They break & my 9 year old only played with them for about 2 hours -- and he was mad the whole time because it kept breaking.
2,DON'T BUY THIS IF:,"If you expect any pictures to give you a feel for the place, then don't buy this book. The picture on the cover is the only thing you'll get.Where I'm coming from: I don't travel to shop, eat, meet the locals or absorb new culture: I go to see beautiful man-made and natural wonders. An hour spent at a sidewalk cafe absorbing the ""atmosphere"" is an hour that could be spent seeing more of a castle, cathedral, museum, mountain, lake etc.Perhaps if you already know what you want to see, what's worth seeing in Norway, then the information in the book might be useful. But if you've never been to the place before, BUY THE EYEWITNESS SERIES books, they have pictures and 3D perspective drawings of specific neighborhoods give a nice feel for what one might want to see."
1,this book is toilet paper,"My god this book was awful. This was my first (and last) purchase of a Frommer's guide. I initially bought it based solely on the fact that it was the most recently published guide for Norway among all of the available guides at the time. Much of the information was embarrasingly wrong. If you are a member of AARP, you may enjoy the suggestions in this book. The worst part was the maps. Would it kill them to put all the information such as hotels, restaurants, shopping and entertainment on the SAME map instead of making me jump back and forth between several maps? The separation of graphic information made it frustratingly difficult to plan out daily itineraries. This book found better use as toilet paper. I ended up tossing the Frommer's guide on day 2 of my trip and I purchased a Lonely Planet and Rough Guide, something I should've done from the get go."
2,it plane out sucked,"i travel in a group with 3 other individuals .. we have traveled over Europe for several years now and used Guide books from several company's, but this had to be the worst. I payed for and bought the current years book, and express shipped it for our trip and in the end the information was so invaluable or wrong the book became a joke amongst us. From now on Frommer's will be a library check out only brand for me and my crew. The restrant recommendations were never right, 1/2 the time the place didn't exist and the other 1/2 the food items recommended in the book were not available for what ever reason."
1,Almost lasted one use,"The box claims that this pump is good to 100 psi. My tire pressure was just about 50 psi when the pump hose burst. This occurred on the first use, right out of the box.The frame of the pump was pretty flimsy...any pressure not directly down caused it to collapse.Might as well use an asthma inhaler to pump up your tires..."
2,broke after 2 uses,"We bought this for the office, and it broke after the second use. I would have returned it, but it had been a long time from the time we bought it."
1,shockingly bad,"Granted, I've been out of the cycling loop for decades, but the stuff Schwinn is allowing their name on is shocking.This ""pump"" is so flimsy that the frame bent the second time I pressed on it (I'm only 180 lbs. and I was being careful)so I kept trying to pump my tire up to the recommended 90 psi with this squeaky, floppy thing and the gauge wouldn't go past 65 psi on either tire.Then, after about 40 seemingly useless pumps, something popped in the pump and it now doesn't work at all.I'm not going to blame China on stupefying lack of quality (even though over 50% of the stuff I've bought made there has been crappy) because, at the end of the production line, there should be an American Schwinn representative in charge of quality control...where is it?"
1,Horrible product,"I pressed down on the pump lever, and it did not come back up by itself, in spite of the attached springs. Had to pull it up by hand. Furthermore, that first pump is the only one that actually pumped air. After that, no air. No pressure. Not even a hissing sound as if there were a leak in the apparatus.I am familiar with bicycle pumps of many styles. This one is a piece of junk."
1,rubbish!!,"I ride a Schwinn, my pump was a Schwinn, I thought they could be friends.This was my mistake.This pump had it in for my bike. It wouldn't inflate past 45 PSI, and when I tried, the hose came loose from the pump. Because the nozzle wouldn't detach easily, I couldn't get it out in time to keep air in my tire. Thanks for the flat tire, Schwinn pump. This is the flimsiest (see how it bends under 130 lbs of weight!), jumpiest (put enough pressure and it will leap frog from right under your foot and hit you in the ankle!), whiniest (*pump* SQUEEEEEEEE *pump* SQUEEEEEEEEE), least reliable pump I have ever used. Keep this thing away from my bike."
5,Very Effective to Shape Heavy Legs,I started seeing results in 2 weeks! Who cares if the models don't smile! They seem serious to me and appear to be listening to Brians instructions. They are fit and if the routine looks easy--thats because these girls are in shape--and You out there will be too if you follow the workout. I advanced to leg weights in 3 weeks and now I can really feel my muscles working! The routine seems like a class and the instructor walks arounds and gives training tips...he is NOT supposed to do all the exercise--thats why he has 4 models do it!
4,"yep, they are weird looking.","I like this video. Exercises are basic, simple and easy to do at home. It's very easy to follow, and also has a demostration of the exercises before each workout.The 12 minutes workouts are extremly motivating for me. It's hard to find an excuse to do not spend 12 minutes on yourself.And about the models...well...they are weird, they never smile, they dull and unhappy but they have great bodies, wich is very motivating.I don't really like videos were people is jumping, laughing at anything and touching themselves all the time. This video is very simple and clean.I'll recommend it to anyone who enjoys a peaceful workout."
2,"Come on, this is [not good]","I can't handle the ... girls in this DVD & the instructor guy really annoys me. I do like the recommendations for workout ""gear"" and that they break down the equiptment required prior to starting the workout, but that hardly saved it.The other thing is that the girl working out in the front appears to be talking to herself, and it doesn't look like she's counting reps!However the work out is tough. But not my favorite."
1,?? how do yu (sample) listen 2a album ?,how tha hell can i rate it if i cant listen 2 it ? ida rate tha album 1994 ButI cant getta sample ........ dag !!
3,Bears NFL football item,"Love the football, bought it for a gift for guests to sign and write messages on for a baby shower, unfortunetly the ball wasn't all blue, like it is shown in the picture. Still like it, but it misleading!"
4,Looks Different,"The Bears football I received is not the same as pictured. The one pictured is all blue and mine is blue and orange. I still like the football, but thought future buyers should not you may not receive the one pictured. My son loves it too. I bought him a plain brown football and he would rather play with the Bears football."
4,Bethany's Song,"I enjoyed Bethany's Song the second in books with the storyline of 3 sisters. Though the book was used, it was in good condition and I received it within just a few days after ordering it. It can stand alone but it was nice to read it after the first book, ""Alicia's Song"" also by Susan Plunkett."
2,"Sorry, but I am disappointed...","I bought this CD based on commenter reviews (strangely all very positive) and frankly am very disappointed. After a half-dozen listenings not one track moves me -- in fact, to me they all sound about the same. Wife and I agree that this CD would be perfect for background music in a dentist's office. Sorry, I had hoped for a much better experience."
2,Tingstad/Rumbel,"Nothing special. I expected more interesting, creative music. Musicianship OK but some of their other pieces on the radio were far better."
5,Hallelujah,"I've been searching for this album for over 25 yrs. I had it as a teenager but stupidly, gave it away. Now that I've found it again, I will never let it go. The only thing that would be better would be for them to package this soundtrack with the actual documentary."
5,Inspires my soul,"I play a few songs to get my mind thinking in a positive direction. I really appreciate this CD. It's a rap, but the music in the background and even the rap itself puts in me in a special trance."
2,if you want to read a comix book-this is a good one...,"The title of the book reflets the exact attitude of the authors when they were writing it ""... without really trying"". The book is very brief and a little outdated. It seems like the book was written for a 2nd grader: the font is huge, and you know what that means - the book could be twice smaller the size it's now. Basically, if you want to know the info that was written in that book, just buy Building Your Own WebSite by O'Reilly, i think it's much better. If you get your hands on this book, read it, it's not gonna kill you, But I would not spend my money on it, not worth it."
5,"Love Louis, Great Copy","I've always loved Louis CK and I have a comedy movie night with some friends, so I bought this to watch. I got a great copy and Louis CK is hilarious (as usual). I think for the most part you can watch about everything from this video on YouTube, but it's still worth having. A couple jokes were not available on YouTube."
4,"Louis C.K.- The ""New George Carlin""","Louis C.K.: One Night Stand gives you a 30 minute dose of Louis C.K. and his ""no hold"" brand of observational humor that has earned him a cult following. Louis touches upon the sometimes crazy moments one experiences in everyday married life, and many other common day to day observations, much like George Carlin did in his stand-up. Carlin was a major influence on Louis C.K. and his direct ""tell it like it is"" style. If you are a fan of the great late George Carlin like I am, you will appreciate Mr. C.K.'s brand of humor. I recommend this video."
1,So not funny,"If you liked Louis C.K. on SNL like we did, don't go thinking that Louie would be similarly funny on this DVD. Very disappointed in the vulgar talk and constant hip thrusting of simulated humping on both this DVD and Season One of his cable show Louie. We only made it through a few episodes and had to give up. So there goes a few hours of my life that I'm never gonna get back. If you want some really funny comedy that is not vulgar and that you can actually watch with your adult children without being absolutely mortified that you bought this material to share with them, then check out Brian Regan or Bill Burr. Now they are funny! Shareable funny."
5,Amazing comedian,"This man is brilliant!!!!He was suggested to me by comedian friends in London, (he's American). A comedian's comedian. I really love him. Watching you tube clips I can see he is just getting better at his craft too.I don't think you'll regret buying this.I didn't!"
5,Tom Swift and His Rocket Ship,The seller was great. The book came very quickly and was actually in better condition than advertised. This gave me a chance to get an excellent copy of a book from my youth to share with my grandchildren.
1,a disservice to Asia Indian cuisine,"I love Asian Indian dishes .... that is, until I tried this dry-and-tasteless-as-cardboard meal. I wouldn't feed it to my dog. Needs much work."
4,"Wow, great Worship song","Track 6 is such a moving and powerful expression of how awesome our GOD is. Simple, yet very effective in evoking spiritual emotions and feelings. It's great for a praise and worship session."
3,A Basic Car Charger,"If you want a simple and affordable car charger that will provide a recharge until you can get to your desktop charger, this will do the job. The reach of the cord is not very long, so it makes using the phone while attached to the charger somewhat uncomfortable. Otherwise, it will provide a charge."
4,An entertaining fantasy that doesn't take it self too seriously,"""The Castle of Iron"" is a sequel to ""The Incomplete Enchanter,"" and continues the saga of Harold Shea, a 20th century American who finds himself in a world of wizards, dragons, and other fantasy elements. Long before the Harry Potter books, de Camp and Pratt were mining this genre for laughs. Not great literature, but great fun!"
4,van is irish,i wish he sang danny boy the best irish song ever but this is great stuff too irish heartbeat sounds better than the irish tenors they are good too but van noone can sing like the man van you irish lad you
3,Irish music fan,"I was somewhat disappointed in this cd. I expected music that was more authentic than what was on the cd. I heard what sounded like rock music. The cd entitled ""the best of the chieftains"" was more to my liking."
4,Power and grace!,"I love this CD! It's so uncommon to find Celtic music performed with the power and passion of Van Morrison's great baritone voice. He brings a pace and rhythm to classics like ""Raglan Road"" and ""Celtic Ray"" that pays homage to their origins but stamps them indelibly, Van Morrison. He adds an incredible presence to the Chieftans fine instrumentals. It is unequivocal, unabashed, fearless in it's exploration, and good for at least a few goose-bumps."
2,Lids may leak,"The idea behind these plastic lids is great, and for many applications will be fine--but be aware that for thin liquids, you may experience some leakage unless you really crank them down tightly. I bought them for an application where the jars contain a very thin liquid (pure ethanol or an ethanol/water mix) and need to be shaken daily. I have to be careful not to shake them too hard, or leave them inverted for even a moment, or they DO leak."
2,An amateur attempt with good photos,"Other than the photos, there isn't much here. It's very amateurish. Whole categories are missing -- there is barely a mention of ""Fiesta"" at all. Makes you think the publisher had an arrangement so as not to infringe on sales of their Fiesta books. There is no mention of Metlox. Also, while there is a price guide, it only lists the specific pieces that are shown in the photos, not all the pieces in the line. This is a major shortcoming. There should be some mention of pieces not shown. The book is also poorly organized, with ads from old magazines interspersed with original writing. It reminds me of an 8th grade book report. Spend your money elsewhere."
4,Colorful reference book of patterns and shapes,"The Collector's Encyclopedia of AMERICAN DINNERWARE contains hundreds of full color pictures as well as copies of the original store and catalogue ads. All pieces shown are priced. Book contains a price index (1984) and a complete glossary of dinnerware terms in the back. I enjoyed the references, however I was disappointed that not all the pieces to any particular pattern were listed or priced. Over-all this is a good book for novice collectors or just the curious."
2,Not Very Impressed,"While the book was somewhat helpful with listing the various companies, it was very short in pattern names, examples and pricing."
4,Uncle is Happy,"I ordered this duster for my Uncle because he was really wanting a long length neutral colored duster. (He already had a black one at a shorter length.) When my uncle came into town and tried on ""The Original Duster"" that I ordered, he loved it. It's long length is perfect for colder weather, but it also sports the option of button snapping the bottom portion up so it can be a shorter duster as well. Very functional, great snaps and pockets. :)"
2,MORE 1930S B-WESTERN SILLINESS FROM JOHN WAYNE,"THIS TIME, JOHN WAYNE PLAYS A MAN SENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO HELP A TOWN OUT THAT'S BEING TERRORIZED BY A VILLAIN CALLED THE SHADOW. DATED AND SILLY, BUT, IT DOES SHOW JOHN WAYNE IN HIS EARLIER DAYS LEARNING HIS CRAFT. IT'S NOT A GOOD MOVIE BY ANY MEANS, BUT IT REMAINS A CURIO AT BEST."
1,The Star Compacter,"This is another one of those unsettling B westerns Wayne did before he hit it big in ""Stagecoach."" Everything about this is pretty creaky, and loses all entertainment value as it goes along. Sorry, Duke."
3,"A Classic ""B""",Obviously written in a more innocent era. I'm sure the kids loved it during a Saturday matinee. Fun to watch just to see how it was done in the day.
5,A 'Must Read'!,"This book is so important that I have both a paper and ebook version. Though dated, the essays are important for an understanding of African American biblical hermeneutics."
1,African Holy Bible Jubilee illustration,"Hello in this new mellineum,I am trying to ascertain if a bible of such is in existence.My search so far has led me to no avale.If there is a sight or book in your possesion inwhich i can reveiw please relay information to me.Thank you and happy new mellenium."
3,Hard drive Pulse!,"PCMS USB 2.0 to IDE 2.5"" / 3.5"" / 5.25"" multi-purpose external drive adapter (convert IDE internal device into external USB 2.0). This is a great item. I purchased this some years back from a vendor on amazon and it has continued to work fine. I highly recommend this product, especially, if you have computer hard drive/disk crashers in your family."
5,Kaiser Bakeware Kaisercast 6-1/2-Inch Saphir Bundtform Pan,"i had been wanting these pans for a long time and finally justified buying them to make some little cakes for a church bake sale.they are really nice heavy pans , worth the extra $ and i wish i had not waited so long to buy them!"
3,decent enough for price,The s shape bands look a lot nicer in the photo then they do in person but the stones are a lot better looking so it kind of balances out. Do not expect it to look as nice as the photo though
3,"Well made, but not as pretty as the picture","I bought this as a gift for my mom. It is admittedly not to my taste, but my mom has very different taste in jewelry than I do. I was actually kind of excited about it, because it seemed like something she would like a lot.Pros: It seems well made and has a nice clasp. It also arrived pretty quickly.Cons: The somewhat blurry picture gives you a different idea of the opal coloring. This is not a deal breaker for me. The opal is not ugly, just not nearly as subtle as it seems in the picture. However, the s-shaped pieces just look kind of weird in person. They're very flat and have weird bumps on them. Perhaps they're supposed to look like diamond chips? I have no idea."
4,Not your average Kundera,"It is true that 'Farewell Waltz' is among Kundera's lighter novels and does not pack as much of a philosophical punch as some of his other works. However this is not to say that it lacks the gifted Kunderian touch.What Kundera presents us with here is an examination of the complications that can be encountered where matters of the heart are concerned. The characters of 'Farewell Waltz' are plagued with inconquerable passions, raging jealousies and, at times, appallingly shallow self-interestedness.These potentially unpleasant characteristics however form a potent and entertaining mix for the reader, as well as a novel that is not short on depth and examinations of the emotional turmoil that the human mind is prone to.Although the characters of this novel are somewhat more unpleasant than those in Kundera's other offerings. 'Farewell Waltz' is still a good read and an interesting aside in the career of a great writer."
1,Not what was expected,"The book was not in great condition, with lots of bending in the cover and pages and it also had highlights and markings throughout that were not in the product description."
2,Rather dissapointing,"After having read the other reviews all praising this book, I felt an obligation to voice my own opinion. Let me say, first off, that I love Kundera. The Unbearable Lightness of Being is my favorite book. So I was very dissapointed to find none of the great writing, philosophical messages, or deep meaning in Farewell Waltz that I had expected to find. It is obvious from the writing that this is one of Kundera's earlier works. It has none of the polished prose of his later novels. In fact I was almost tempted to not read further Kundera books after this one. Fortunately I picked up Slowness, an absolutly marvelous novella that once again sparked my interest in this talented writer. I recommend that unless you are a diehard Kundera fan, that you skip this one."
2,the inspiration is over,"what ever happened to this group? their first album was a masterpiece, then a second much less inspired and now this revelations which is again a step back. i mean, rossiter can always write good songs but we are very far from the excellence of hounted by you, london can you wait and the rest of the songs of their first work."
4,A DELIGHTFULLY AND TASTEFULLY DONE,A WONDERFUL BLEND OF CREATIVITY AND A NICE ARRAY OF FINE NUBIAN BROTHERS SHOW OFF MORE THAN THEIR SKILLS IN THIS STEAMY CALENDAR. TOO BAD IT IS NOT LONG ENOUGH.
3,america's critic,"I thought this was pretty good some parts were dulled out but for the scares and screams it can get ya, i give one missed call 3*"
2,YOU HAVE TO BE KIDDING ME?!?,"Us horror loving freaks wait and wait for the next big scare. If you are like me and you hold your breath for the next scary flick, then you are going to die for lack of oxygen with this film. The story line is so shallow that I was able to guess every second of the movie. Come on folks...a cell phone message from yourself sometimes hours or days before your death? Oh and wait a second here...it is coming from a naughty bad girl ghost. Better yet...mommy comes and gets her in the end. Ludicrous story line people! Sorry to give you the spoiler's folks but trust me when I say to avoid this film!"
2,run-of-the-mill horror outing,"""One Missed Call"" confirms what many of us have long suspected: that voice mail is indeed a tool of the devil. In this film, an evil spirit sends death messages to a group of terrorized college students via a cell phone tree. Soon, the corpses are piling up almost as fast as the discarded calling devices, while Beth (Shannyn Sossamon), one of the targeted victims, and Jack (Edward Burns), the homicide detective who takes on the case, race around madly trying to bring an end to the horror.This mediocre, assembly-line product comes equipped with the requisite number of nubile young victims, phony leads, false scares and hyperventilating special effects. But, frankly, all you'll really be wondering is how many cell phones were harmed in the making of this film."
4,Pretty generic but still creepy,Ok so the movie had plot holes and a pretty funny scene where the poor cat can't even avoid the evil but other than that it did creep the ______out of me. I put my phone to silent after watching this!
3,MISSED my mailbox...,"Oye, Took TWO WEEKS to get here when my other items ordered same day arrived on the next business day or two. Good movie though and glad i ordered it..."
3,its alright,being another remake of a popular Japanese movie series. One might think that they would do a better job with this one they did. First gripe being that first character in the movie was supposed to be a major point for people to watch the movie is gone within a few minutes. The story while done better before of course isnt really all that interesting this time around. The concept itself is solid but the execution and acting from most involved just seemed really off.It was a waste of having Ed Burns in the movie playing the cop investigating the mysterious deaths by cell phone. Even he cant help this one rise above the mediocrity that One Missed Call ends up being. At best its another average remake of a already done and executed better Japanese movie with some freaky stuff thrown in not something that you'll miss. Just rent it and move on thats about all its worth to me.
1,ONE MISSED MOVIE!,"I AM UNABLE TO THOROUGHLY RATE THIS MOVIE SINCE IT DID NOT PLAY ON MY PLAYER, MY FAMILY'S PLAYER, & ALL OF MY FRIENDS' PLAYERS; HOWEVER, BASED ON WHAT I DID NOT SEE, I CAN HONESTLY SAY THAT THIS MOVIE HAD ABSOLUTELY NO PLOT LINE WHATSOEVER & THE SPECIAL EFFECTS WERE LITERALLY NON-EXISTENT. & THE ACTORS? WHAT CAN I SAY? I REALLY CAN'T HOLD ANYTHING AGAINST THEM SINCE THEY HAD NOTHING TO WORK WITH. ALL IN ALL, I WOULD HAVE TO GIVE THIS MOVIE A ""THUMBS DOWN."" ""ONE MISSED CALL"" IS A MOUTH FULL. & THE LACK OF A PICTURE SAYS A THOUSAND WORDS."
1,BAD Remake.,"Boring, pointless, and dumb. I didn't like this film at all. There's nothing good to say about this remake. Skip this and watch the original."
3,not the best,It's ok the the best movie but i still liked in it' got a good story to it and the ending is ok
2,"Sorry, wrong number","I wasn't that impressed with the original movie(s), so watching the American adaptation didn't instill any hope that their facsimile would be any better (never mind an improvement). I wasn't wrong. This version stalled, tripped, then fell flat on its face early on. I've never seen such a lifeless horror flick. Everyone and everything was bland. There was an overriding sense of disinterest by everyone involved. I got the feeling that they just wanted to get it over with and move on to something better. Poor Ed Burns looked stunned throughout, as though he couldn't believe his agent stuck him with this thankless role. Likewise, Margaret Cho's indifferent contribution as a disbelieving cop. Even the evil ghost that was behind it all came off little better than a cartoon (in fact, at times it even looked animated). I counted one genuinely creepy movement that was instantly lost due to poor lighting.All this movie accomplished was to give peepholes a bad rep."
1,Ed Burns knows he's in a stinker,"Really bad, even for this genre which is pretty bad, even when it's kind of good. The Asian originals make little sense, getting by on atmosphere; the American remakes make even less. This mash up of Ring, Grudge, Final Destination is an incoherent mess, even by the lowest standards, and it's a shame because I really like Shannyn Sossamon. She's one of those actors who have likability even in the worst mess, and she is professional enough to act, instead of phoning it in the way Burns does (he looks great, but he makes it very obvious to the viewer that he knows it's crap and he's only there for a check, which is understandable, but unprofessional).Avoid this- the worst episode of Supernatural is far better."
2,Pretty Dismal...,"In the tradition of The Ring and The Grudge, this is yet another attempt to capitalize on the once-successful franchise of Japanese horror film remakes. However, this movie barely registers on the richter scale. It plods along and by the middle of it, I found it almost laughable. It leaves one to wonder what the original film was like and whether it was as incongruous and silly. Shannyn is a good actress and would be better suited for more original material. Only watch this if you feel ghosts traveling thru cell phones to usher your demise is a terrifying premise. Could be. But not that well-executed here."
1,HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME!!!,Today is my 19th Birthday and I had to see this crappy movie on my Birthday last year. I had wanted to see Walk Hard. I heven't seen this movie since! It's something about these girls hearing themselves die on their cell phones. I would not recommend ONE MISSED CALL!!!
1,Godawful,"One Missed Call, yet another PG-13 take on the Japanese horror genre, is a godawful mess from beginning to end. A group of young people start getting mysterious messages on their cell phones, which contain recordings of their own future deaths. Sadly, One Missed Call does little with the premise, other than throw one predictable scare at you one right after the other. The script is terrible with some hideous moments of dialogue, and the film as a whole lacks any kind of real guts and feels incredibly restrained in it's violence, and thus has no teeth to speak of. The acting, if one were to call it that, is just as bad. Not to mention, one has to wonder just what Edward Burns did to get cast in garbage like this. If starring in A Sound of Thunder was bad enough, Burns heads a cast here that includes Shannon Sossamon, Meagan Good, Azura Skye, and Ray Wise; and he manages to out do them all. Granted though, it isn't by much. Avoid like the plague."
1,Two missed hours,"This movie is just awful. Plain terrible. Ed Burns must be needing to pay the rent. It's a cripplingly slow, illogical teen drama, that employs all the cliches we've come to expected from poor-written, hacked-together J-horror, including:- Inexplicably p**sed-off scary girl at the center of the whole thing.- The detective with the implausible interest in a bizarre case.- The unexplained 'chain of death' (a la Grudge or Ring).But whereas the Grudge was just plain ridiculous while scary (don't the neighbors get suspicious about that house?), and we all marveled at Samara's calendar scheduling skills in the Ring, this stinker wouldn't scare a 5-year old and there's no reason at all for any parts of the plot.Oh, and the foreshadowing is so labored that even my wife said ""why do they keep showing that"" (in between reading a book and polishing her nails because she was so bored)."
1,Another stupid movie,"Save your time and money, this is another horror movie with all the cliché you are already use to. Don't buy, don't rent and don't watch !"
1,Miss this one call,"In this case, the Japanese original is way better than the remake. I have nothing against remakes, but this one just doesn't work that well. First, it's not very scary. Then the acting comes off kind of stiff and overall it gets pretty boring. Too bad, it had some potential that wasn't realized. Being PG-13 didn't help."
1,One Missed Plot,"Don't you hate seeing a movie with potential, (even if it is only a little potential, as in this one) but then some bad acting and Horrible directing ruin it? I do. I can't help but keep myself occupied during the seemingly forever running time, thinking of how I would have done it.This movie starts off so lame and continues steadily the entire time. No real plot or character development. No directoral flow. No good acting. And the only thing creepy about the entire movie is the creepy ring tone. But the whole concept of a cell phone curse is totally B Grade and cheesy. Also, the broadcasted exorcism by a day time talk show host sums it all up.Don't waist your time. You'll wonder why you didn't just ignore this call."
4,Don't Miss This Call,"Though this movie is much like the other Ring and Grudge movies, this is still a really good movie. The PQ and AQ of this Blu Ray version is quite nice. Be sure to pick up a copy of this."
1,"One movie you should ""miss""","This is a J-horror remake film that falls into the whole cliche of J-horror film remakes. This film could've possibly been OK, but I'm one of the many people who don't like this movie. ""One Missed Call"" is cliche in basically every way. It was basically as bad as ""Pulse"". I also hate that line where that girl says something like ""You get a phone call, you hear your death, and then you die"". It's trying to be creepy when it's horribly acted. There are some creepy points in this film, like that weird creature and those people that have screaming faces as eyes, but that's about it. You could possibly get this creepy feeling at the ending, but the feeling won't last long at all. You will NOT lose any sleep over this movie...unless you've never seen a horror movie and you're 6 years old. All in all, you don't absolutely have to skip it, but you probably won't really like it, unless you like American horror films based on Asian originals."
3,...HAD TO WATCH IT A 2ND TIME!!!,"First, of all, I saw this movie/remake, when it 1st went to DVD after the theatrical release. And originally, I would've gave this film 4 stars, however, after the 2nd viewing.The reason for the first 4 stars was that I could follow the story the 1st 3/4's of the way.AFTER 2ND VIEWINGthat last 1/4's of the movie, the last 15 to 25 mins. did not make any sense and barely had any tie in to the storyline. The price of under $2, was unbeatable, but the level of remaking a movie, unfortunately is beatable.CONCLUSIONIf you can find it, dirt cheap and have never seen it before go for it, maybe you can figure out the last few minutes and the purpose of the killings"
3,IT WAS OK.,"This movie was ok. Nothing spectacular. The nurse that was supposedly burned alive at the hospital who crawled in the vent looked fake when it attacked Beth. Once the character Taylor got her phone/video message, she was done for. Yet, she and Beth destroy their phones. At that point, it's too late, you already got your ""missed call""!"
1,Ouch,"Ok, lets see what we got here;Bad Actors CheckTerrible Plot CheckPlenty of Yawns Check87 minutes ill never get back CheckYep, looks like its all here...the making of a suck festDont Waste your time."
3,Mediocre PKD=Still better than 99% of sci fi,"This is an early PKD and as such isn't up to the mad brilliance of his later writing... but it's got its moments. Like all PKD it makes you think, hard. Paradoxes abound.However, it shouldn't be too high on your PKD priority list."
3,Simple and uncomplicated,"This is Dick at his most simple period of writing. There are no mind-bending journeys through the consciousness of the universe, as on later works, Ubik, and Three Stigmata. The plot is dull and unbelievable. Dick falls prey to the same trap all writers face when writing about one who sees the future: It's very easy to prove the fortune teller wrong by merely acting against all his predictions. Buy Three Stigmata or Ubik and you are off to a better start."
5,Unique sound and style where every song gets you!,"Another masterpiece from this group. Each new release gets better and better. After listening to the songs and picking up the rythym, the words really start standing out. Each song has an unbelieveable message behind it straight from scripture. When I'm having a bad day, this CD easily brightens it. It's a must for Christians and anybody who likes the acappella style of music. It's a Godly group who sacrifices so much to touch many lives from all realms of the globe."
1,trash,Acappella is one of my favorite groups...BUT!this album was a disgrace to the sound of a cappella singing!don't waste your money on this one.
2,Not Great,"Not only was the book filled with way too much detail about coal mining and its history, but there were way too many characters to keep straight, way too many subplots going on, and having the culprit turn out to be someone who wasn't even involved in the story, and didn't show up until the end of the book, just to tie it to the previous book, was a complete letdown.I see the next book is also tied to this person. I hope it's not totally out of left field too or I'll be done with this series, which is definitely not on par with Stephanie Plum."
5,"More Bubbles, Please!","Once again, Sarah Strohmeyer has delivered a wonderfully funny, twisted tale about a murder in a small, coal mining town. She hits a home run with her witty dialogue and off-the-wall characters. You'll love watching Bubbles's wheels turn as she figures it all out once again!"
3,Lighthearted amateur sleuth,"This one reminds me a bit of Nancy and Ned in the old Nancy Drew books. It's hard to take a mystery seriously when the main character is named Bubbles and the guy's name (well, his last name) is Stiletto. Bubbles, true to her name, looks frothy and wears Spandex, but we're to believe a mind hides beneath the hair spray (reminiscent of Legally Blonde) as she investigates what appears to be theft, extortion and maybe murder.Totally silly, but fun."
3,Offbeat but a little off....,"Bubbles is trouble and a ""laugh-and-a-half"". Almost a Lucy Ricardo type. I've read all her books and totally enjoy them and the quirky corner of Pennsylvania, where the stories are located.However, this one, ""Ablaze"" never set off the fire for me. First of all, this part of Pennsylvania is rather depressing - and economically depressed - (I've visited there) so its a little hard to make light of. I read half the book and put it aside for a few months before I could get into it again. But now I am totally confused with so many characters, subplots - like is Strohmeyer and/or Bubbles in a manic state or something? I felt the writing was just rushing one from one detail to another character to whatever was next. A little Lithium here, please!! Still, I love Bubbles and will stick with her no matter what, though I wish she's get out of Slagville. How about a little visit south to Bucks County for some relief?"
3,Investigation turns up the heat!!!,"This book was funny, easy, fast and a delight to read. Bubbles is a hairdresser/ journalist who finds her self caught between an exciting man and a deadly mystery. The coal mines of a small Pennsylvania town are burning and appear to be worthless. The mystery begins when people are murdered in order to keep interest away from a specific mine. When the plan backfires and peoples lives are on the line, the mystery deepens.When the coal miners wives begin to work together, and Bubbles begins to investigate, things heat up!!!"
4,Wonderful,"Yet another wonderful, elegant book from this master. It is a delight to read his every carefully constructed sentence."
4,One of the standard blackjack books of all time!,"Truly A book which should be in your blackjack library. I also recommend, Gregorian Strategy for multiple deck blackjack."
2,Dull,"This is a competent if incredibly dull mass of information about the hi-lo count system. Despite several revisions much of the material is outdated related to sidebets and conditions that no longer exist at the tables. The book is very poorly written, Wong's dry style reads like a telephone directory without the spicy bits.Wong is that terminal cliche-the gambling writer who makes more money writing than gambling himself. I'd appreciate more in the way of personal success at the tables so I know this stuff really works rather than abstract theory.Buy something else a bit more modern and a little more interesting if you are looking for a good read. This book is a good introduction to card counting however."
1,Disappointing Book,"I have enjoyed Stanford's other books, and the reviews made me believe this would be a great book. Unfortunately, after purchasing it, I realized that it contained very little text and was rather a long list of tables on advanced ways of playing hands. This book would be good for an extremely proficient card counter looking to add more indices to his game; however, it does little to teach someone how to go from being a good card counter to being a professional. It seems more like the output of a computer simulations that we could memorize to alter our playing decisions. While this may be helpful to some, it's certainly not what I was expecting or looking for in this book.-Leo"
3,Oldie but goodie -- recommended,"Professional Blackjack by Stanford Wong is a classic book on card counting. It was originally written and published in the late 1970's, and is little changed in the current edition. As many reviewers have noted over the years, Wong's writing style is brittle and lacks punch, but the information is solid (though a little dated) and this book contains most of what you need to become a winning Blackjack player...."
5,Amazingly Indepth & Great Analysis of Blackjack!,"We don't call him ""The Honorable Stanford Wong"" for nothing. He completely encompasses the breadth of blackjack, all the ins and outs, how to count cards (the different schools of counting too!) and if you didn't already know, basic strategy and its variations in unusual arenas. I went into reading this book knowing just basic strategy -- I came out with a complete understanding of the game! This is a CRUCIAL book to have if you have any serious interest in blackjack as more than just a recreational activity. The jargon CAN get a little heavy and involves some mathematical theories I never learned, but it was helpful in explaining a lot of things missing from general, ""at the table"" blackjack training. It truly is THE BIBLE of blackjack."
3,To Your Inquiry,"To All those who wish to know the Elvis song played while J and K are traversing the tunnell to Queens, the song is ""Promised Land"" on his album also titled ""Promised Land"""
3,Underrated Soundtrack! Not Great But Not Bad Either!,"Men In Black, like most soundtracks these days, only has maybe a few related songs to the movie. The rest are just fillers. Still, it isn't too bad. In my view, Will Smith's original ""Men In Black"" song will always be the theme to me (didn't care for the one he made for the second film). I also liked the debuts of Alicia Keys and Destiny's Child as well. DC pretty much showed what was to come later. Alicia's showed off her musical skills but not her voice so it was a surprise that she came correct as she did later on.The rest of the songs were okay but the Snoop Dogg/JT song ""Get Down On It"" stands out as well as The Roots/D'Angelo song. Wouldn't pay full price for it but I'd buy it at a reduced price."
4,This is a very good album,"Anyone who enjoys good R&B music will get much enjoyment from this CD. Nas also has a very good rap track on this CD. A good mix of various artists. This CD offers a soothing and relaxing aray of tracks. To tell u the truth I was suprised how good this CD was, I only bought it for the Ginuwine track. My other favorite track would have to be Trey Lorenz's ""Make u happy""."
5,The MIB Is The BOMB!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Since my friends and I did a dance to the Men Black I got pretty attached to it, so that is one reason that I like it. And there are a amuch more I just can't type them all right now. OH! by the way my name is Vanessa"
2,its not that good,"what the hell all these stars for?.the only reason i like this album is because.alicia keys song,snoop and a handfull of other track that was ok.but this album is far from bangin"
4,Mariah Carey's on this soundtrack,FYI - The always fabulous Mariah Carey sings backup vocals on Make You Happy by Trey Lorenz.
3,"So-So, Nothin' Less, Nothin' More","Sure, this CD (or cassette, whichever you prefer) is a must-buy if you love Will Smith's wonderful song Men in Black, but besides that and the Opening Theme and Closing Theme, the music isn't that great. The songs have basically nothing to do with the theme of the Men in Black movie and the lyrics are either stupid or unintelligible. Just listen to the first and two last tracks."
2,Great for the price.,"I got it because it was cheap, but it does its job well. One thing bugged me though; after a few weeks the screen began to turn foggy in the material itself, making it a little harder to see the screen. After a few months, the screen became unreadable. This product does not last and is good for only a few months of usage.BTW: The installation process requires that you place the magnetic reader on the front fork and the magnet on the front spokes, but it does not tell you how high up on the spokes it needs to be. It does not matter where you put it on the front spokes, because any location will pass by the forks at the exact same time. The outer part of the spokes will just pass the sensor the same as the inner part of the spokes, not affecting the meter."
4,Makes beautiful cakes!,"My cakes are beautiful when using this pan. There are a lot of grooves that can be difficult to clean if the pan is not coated with spray or butter properly. However, the pan is well made so very little coating is needed. I would highlighy recommend this pan if you are looking for a decorative look for your cakes.I gave a 4-star rating due to the amount of clean-up required, but that is typical with this type of pan."
5,Kaiser 61/2 inch bundt pan,this pan was purchased to use for baking for 2 people. It is an ideal size. My first use was with monkey bread and it came out very easily. I was impressed with the weight of the pan which will make the pan durable.
5,Remarkable Radio!!,"This radio is certainly superb!! I use it mostly for sking and the range is very good along with all the functions. Reception and clarity is also state of the art, buy one and you won't regret it."
2,Don't buy this disc!,"This disc contains recordings of patriotic favorites that are otherwise available to the public for free directly from the military. The recordings on this disc were never meant to be commercially distributed - indeed the military is prohibited from doing so and thus gives them away for free. I have spoken with many of the military performers here in DC and they resent that a commercial company is able to sell these otherwise free recodings as a result of a quirk in the law. More importantly, the selections are not recorded in a way that is consistent with professional commercial standards. Other commercial patriotic CDs are much better. Try the Washington Men's Camerata's ""Spirit of Freedom"" on Gothic or Shaw's ""Battle Cry of Freedom"" on RCA."
3,Good; but not what I expected,"I purchased this CD after the funeral of President Reagan when I heard the superb music put forth by our American military bands. Unfortunately, that quality was not recreated in this collection. I was especially interested in hearing what I perceived as the traditional ""military""sound; that is, a chorus of men. Many of the songs on this album had the predominate sound of sopranos. I was reminded more of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir than ""singing sergeants"". With all respect due to women in the military..God bless every one of them..it just wasn't my idea of a military band. The instrumental songs were solidly good and toe-tapping. I especially loved the version of the Marines Hymn which was arranged so differently from the usual sprightly ""Halls of Montezuma"". It was in the warm, mellow tones of a traditional hymn. I will happily play this album again and again, but with the known caveat that I will not be hearing an all-male chorus."
3,"I still listen to this CD, but......",It would be good to mention the artists of the various tunes on this CD. I was disappointed in that. The shipping was timely and the product arrived ingood condition.
3,thread is good for repairs.,"With singer I expected a thicker thread, it may be because its a polyester instead of cotton. I will probably use this for small mending and double up on my stitching."
3,not what i thought,"I have fine black hair so I have been looking for a good volumizing product to give it some life. I bought this after reading all the good reviews thinking it would give me the volume i've been seeking, but it's more of a styling product. It helped my hair stay up, but it didn't give it any volume. Also it made my hair feel dry and brittle. I'm not sure if I used it wrong, but it's not what I was looking for."
3,Just okay....,"Got this product based on the reviews and I do not notice a big volume difference when I use it. Also leaves my hair a little dry, knotty, and sticky. Will try something else next time."
1,Didn't spray,The product would not spray! Didn't want to make a big deal out of this but since you asked me...
4,Microsoft Works Suite 2002,"I just bought this program and installed all the programs but Picture It! and Streets and Trips. I almost didn't buy this set of programs because of the bad reviews the other reviewers gave it. I had no trouble installing Word or any of the programs for that matter and if you can't install Words, it's true there would be no word processor for Works. I'm running Windows XP(which I love! After years of constant lockups with Win 98, I no longer have this problem, althought fair warning, drivers for some older hardware can be a real problem),a 700 mhz Intel processor, 128 megs ram, and a 6 gig harddrive. Almost time to build myself another new computer, since yes, all these new programs take up a lot room and I could really use more space, but with that a little more horsepower would be better. I do not believe that Works Suite 2002 is made for XP, but maybe that helped ???! I'm just trying to be a little more fair."
2,"software user from chicago IL from user in Seattle,WA","Hi, Very interesting about office/word 2002. We just installed XP and I can't print from Word now. No problems with anything else just office 97 and I installed the drivers? So is there any word or office system that will work? I need to study Excel for a job? Software user in Seattle, WA. THanks!"
4,So far so good...,"I got this program almost 2 months ago. It works really well on XP and has some good features. I'd previously had a 10 year old version of Works so this is a really big change. The full version of Word is included on this software and it's really helpful for a college student who has to write essays for English and other classes at least a couple of times a month. I'll admit, I probably won't use most of the stuff in this package, but it's nice to know it's there in case I do."
3,Bloated but OKAY,"This is a bloated program that contains hundreds of features that most people will not use. Nevertheless, after spending several hours trying to figure it out, I am generally pleased with it. I previously used Works 4.0 (a truly great program, fast, simple, easy) but was forced to upgrade to Works 6.0 due to my new operating system (Windows 2000). The word processor (Word 2000) has a nice look and contains lots of good features when you finally figure it out. My initial impression of this product was unfavorable -- too many features, too complicated -- but I have warmed up to it and feel that our good buddies at Microsoft have done their best to provide a versatile product. It's not an easy program to learn, but if you have the patience to work your way through it, you will probably like it. Bloated but OKAY."
1,Yuck...,"This came pre-installed on my computer, so I gave it a shot. I was sorely disappointed. As a college student, I use spreadsheet and word processors quite frequently. I found that Word 2002 was cumbersome, ugly, and not as simple to use as previous editions (Word '97 was the best); and the spreadsheet was hard to manipulate and often did not operate the way I wanted it to. Making a graph with the proper axes proved quite difficult. To top this all off, this comes with Money 2002, Streets and Trips, and Picture It! Photo... features I doubt I'll ever use. In fact, Encarta may be the only program I might use in the near future. For all others, I'm sticking to Lotus Smart Suite."
4,YAY!,"I'm almost 13 years old and in 8th grade some people think that they are ""too cool for Disney Channel"" so when I saw the preveiws for the movie I thought it looked a little ""kiddish"". But when I watched it I thought it was very good and I found myself singing all the songs. The next day at school EVERYONE was talking about it. Even the people who are ""too cool for Disney Channel"" I reccomend this album. The songs are really, really good and catchy!"
3,Good for some and bad for some,"First of all zac doesn't really sing. it says it in the paper inside the cd. u might think that it is terrible but dont misinterpret it. anyway nice cd, disney!these songs are very good depending on your age group. this is probably best for tweens...so don't write nasty reviews.please rate my review... thx"
1,High School Musical...I hope not,"Mundane, lame, superficial, unmemorable and boring pop music. The performers are undoubtedly talented, but all have generic boy / girl pop bubblegum voices...and the genre of music also owes something to bad 80s synth-pop.Not really worthy of a recording. Maybe it's better in the context of the show, but I'd bet that a large majority of high school students would find this stuff seriously laughable."
2,WHY???,This is your typical Disney Channel Movie. They put it to a bunch of just bareable songs and everyone things it's the best thing since sliced bread. IT'S NOT. Don't be fooled by all the positive reviews this is just a bunch of mediocre voices singing mediocre songs that will cause anyone who enjoys to real showtunes to cringe. This one is only for the kiddies and there are plenty of good musicals out there for them to choose from instead. At least listen to the samples before you buy!
3,Sounds like a spin-off of Grease and Jonathan Larson's Rent,"I don't know the music that well, I'll admit, but from what I've heard just on Amazon the songs sound just like all the music we hear on the radio today. Musicals are differnt than songs on the radio, and I think that's where HSM messed up. These songs could be played on the radio, and if someone didn't know the show, they might think it's just another ordinary song. Hearing ""Summer Nights"" or ""You're the One that I Want"" you just KNOW those songs are meant to be preformed onstage. Or ""Light My Candle"", ""Another Day"", ""La Vie Boheme"", or ""Take Me or Leave Me"" from Rent.Sorry, but although it's got music, I personally wouldn't define it as a ""musical."" Just my opinion....."
5,Awesome Soundtrack,"This soundtrack is full of songs that you will listen to over and over again. They are great party songs as well as fun to listen to on your mp3 player. You can't go wrong with this one, you and all your friends will enjoy it!"
5,Best movie ever,"I saw this movie on disney channel and love it.[i watched it last night too].The singing is amazing!!!My favorite songs are ""Breaking Free"" and ""We're all in this Together"".You just have to buy the sound track."
2,Puhleese..................,"This is one of Disney's more pathetic efforts at securing the preteen and teen aprooval. The movie was dumb enough- cliched and stupid- but the music is an insult to popular music. While the vocals are decent, and the scores OK, the lyrics- while occasionally refreshingly naive- are overdone and forced. Disney should go back to animation and stop stealing teen actors and actresses who waste their talent on these... things."
1,"I bought this for my son and he threw the cd at me, (no joke!).",I dont know why this is number 1 on amazon. I bought this cd for my 8 year old son at a store and he got mad at me and threw the cd at me and said the kids at his school thought it was uncool and that he would get laughed at him if he listened to it.
2,Fun but Kinda Stupid,"To tell you the truth, I origionally liked the movie. But as I saw it the second time, and continuously heard the soundtrack (it's everywhere!), I started to realize: This is a mediocre musical.First of all, the main character, Zac Efron (Troy Bolton), DOESN't EVEN SING! I've read some peoples reviews saying, ""I have proof it was Zac singing!"" Yeah, these people have obsessions with Zac Efron, and won't smell the coffee. To all you people who still believe that it is Zac Efron singing, go to www.imdb.com, search High School Musical, and click on ""cast"" and it says the name of the guy who sings FOR Zac. People, get over it!And another thing. Even though the music may be somewhat entertaining, the plot to the movie is pretty stupid.Overall, I was impressed, until I did my research and found out it isn't even Zac singing! But i give credit to Zacs acting, and the rest of the casts singing and acting. But overall, the music is OK."
5,Oh No! Even I'm humming the tunes!,"Like countless kids across the U.S., my daughter has been bitten by Disney's High School Musical. She counted the days until the arrival of the little brown package and thank goodness it arrived on schedule! From the moment she got that CD opened I have heard NOTHING else streaming out from her bedroom. The tunes are catchy, clean, and charming. Frankly, the hype over this musical reminds me of yesteryear and the fondness my friends and I felt for our favorite musical, Grease. Good job Disney!"
5,Excellent!,This soundtrack had every song that was in the movie and more!!! Me and my friends love dancing and skating to the music. I hope they come out with a DVD soon!
5,Very great CD,My eight year old and I watched the musical on TV and we loved it! I bought her the CD for her birthday. We catch ourselves singing the songs a lot.
5,high school musical,the music is great and i enjoy listening to it every day refreshing and delightful
3,"O.K., But not exciting.","This CD is good for High School Musical fans, but I got sick of the CD in a hurry. Not that it's bad, it just doesn't have anything new and exciting. If you're a fan may-be you should get it, but it's not outstanding. I did like lucas and and ashley's duets, and Vannessa's solo though. But it's not worth the money. Either you get it at an expensive music store, or you pay for it for half the price online, but have to pay a whole bunch of shipping and handling bills. Not worth it. May-be High School Musical 2 will have something better."
3,only half of the magic,"The songs of High School Musical are really excellent,and it would be good to have a portable version, but...In my opinion, a lot of what makes them special is the choreography. You know what I mean if you've seen the film."
5,The best of the best,This Movie was amazing. It was an extremely feel good movie and I loved it. The songs are very catchy and I listen to them every day. Ive also watched the movie about 25 times.BTW Zac did sing SOME of the stuff. Andrew Seeley Wrote and Sang Getcha Head in the Game and most of Zacs other parts but Zac did sing the begining of Breaking Free and Start of Something New and also the part on the balcony in the movie. So yes Zac CAN sing but Andrew sang most of the stuff for him. Check out Andrew and www.drewseeley.net
5,wonderful,My daughter absolutely loves this cd. She plays it over and over. Glad I bought it for her.
1,High School laughing stock,"High School Musical is simply the dumbest movie I have ever seen. The only good thing about it is that it's so stupid that it's funny. I think that someone should inform the dummies that acted that they made a huge fool of themselves. If I were them, I would beg Disney to take back all the orders for the soundtrack and DVD for this weird movie."
2,Ew,"I hate reading annoying reviews by freaky parents applauding their children. It makes me sick. This is not place to inform us about your child's tempremant, or social life. Please keep it to yourself. Also, i think its annoying reading reviews by parents saying 'little jimmy loves the movie, he's only four, and he just learned to talk yesterday"". EUGH!!!!!! You people make me sick.As for the movie, i dont like it anymore, because you people have turned me off it, and because i now know that the main target market for the movie is children under 5.YOU SMELL LIKE POO"
2,HS,"Are you kidding me, I saw this the past weekend, I have to wonder how this is top on amazon already. It was a cheap high school wanna be movie. I found none of the songs to be that catchy. But the overall lesson in the movie to be good for kids."
1,Not Again!!!!!!!!,"For those who expect the next Titanic, don't be fooled. High School Musical is Disneys latest and lamest attempt at sucess. Cheesy stars like Ashley Tisdale and Zac Efron (Oh my he is sooo hot-NOT!!!!>:-() team up to make this catastrophe. The rest of the actors are such nobodys it's painful to watch this. Don't waste your money on the computerized sugar garbage!!! For those looking for real talent, get Beyonce, Fergie, Christina, heck even Paris's-latest. It will top this crap by a mile."
1,damage control,"Ill start out by saying this is a review of the movie not the soundtrack (the songs are actually ok) but in case you didn't know, highschool musicals are nothing like thisthere is no king a nd queen of the club, audtions are so different and students don't write the shows. Oh yeah, theres gays and straights and bis and anything else you could think of and everyones fine with it. Some people might think thats a vulgar thing to say on a kid's movie but hey, gays are a reality and drama clubs love jocks and other people joinging, the varsity football and basketball captain had a lead in Grease last year at my school and its not cause he sang like a pop star. If youre interested in school theatre talk to the people their open minded and we dont bite. Or read ""How I Paid For College"" a great book on the subject. DO not use this movie to make yourself feel like an insider or knowlegeable about this its not and i only hope the sequel will be better."
2,Please Stop The Bleeding In My Ears,"Forgoing all common sense aesthetics, I actually listened to this collection with an open mind and open ears. All I could muster up is that I'm not a tween girl [that marketable age range between 6 and 13]. Any adult with an IQ point higher than that will be heading out towards the ENT to stop the bleeding. It's insufferable - without an iota of talent anywhere in any of these kids. My grade: C-"
2,good at first,i have seen the movie and have the soundtrack but like after the 2nd time it is boring.
1,High School Musical CD - Don't Waste Your Money,"It seems like every kid begs for the HSM CD some point in their life. I wouldn't waste your hard earned money on it. It is nothing but a group of Disney stars singing about what America has stereotyped highschool to be like. Zac Efron doesn't even sing all of the songs, a huge disappointment to any music lover. So, for those parents who's children are begging them, wait a few monthes, get you kid some real music and it will all blow over."
3,B5!!!,i liked this cd but the best song on it was number 11. GET CHA HEAD IN THE GAME BY B5!!i luv that song its sooooo good. the whole cd was good but to me thats the best song
5,Family Fun!!!!,"My kids and I have watched this movie over and over and over again. They love it! They all sing along to the songs from my 3 yr. old up to my 10 yr. old. This is a great soundtrack, one that the whole family can listen to and enjoy!"
5,TOTALLY AWESOME SOUNDTRACK!!,"OMG this movie was wayy kewl! the music is just amazing and kids and adults will luv them. my favorite song is what ive been looking for by sharpay and ryan (ashley tisdale and lucas grabeel) and then stick to the status quo! the movie was amazing and since the premiere, the songs can be heard anywhere! amazing songs!"
4,Mom's review,"As a mother of ""tweeners"" I put my stamp of approval on this musical cd. The kids love to listen to it on the way to school and they are all singing in their lovely off key voices, but what better way to begin your day than singing. It is age appropriate lyrics and the tunes remind them of their now favorite movie."
3,OK......................,"This CD is OK. I mean, seriously, why does everyone like it so much? I know this is my opnion, but I am not a fan of High Musical. I mean, the movie is really good, but gets boring after seeing it like 15 times and the songs get annoying, but I still own this CD and ocasionally listen to it. The songs are OK and this is an OK CD."
2,I Don't Really Like It But You Might,"I don't really like the soundtrack. The only song I like off of this soundtrack is ""Get'Cha Head in the Game"" by B5. I like the original ""Get'Cha Head in the Game"" song, too. I don't really care for the other songs. They are something that you can listen to on Radio Disney. If you like Aly and Aj and Jesse McCartney then this is the soundtrack for you, but if you like more of an N'Sync,B5, and B2K style then this isn't for you. This soundtrack contains some corny stuff that isn't really appealing."
1,Garbage rules supreme...,"If you're into garbage or under the age of seven, this CD will appeal to you. Everyone else, skip it."
5,"HSM Album, and Zac's Voice","I Love this movie and this album. These people who sing it have amazing voices and amazing talent. I do though have to say that while Zac Efron is an amazingly talented actor, he barely sings on this album. He doesn't sing Get'cha Head in the Game and What I've Been Looking For (Reprise) At all. He only sings,""We're Soarin, Flyin, There's not a star in Heaven that we can reach,"" (at the beginning) in Breaking Free and only sings the very beginning and end in Start of Something New. He sings a little bit in I Can't Take My Eyes Off of You and We're all in this together and even then he doesn't sing Troy's part, he sings with the chorus. The person who does sing 95% of Zac's songs is Drew Seeley. Don't get me wrong I'm not saying Zac is a bad singer (I think he's an awesome one) but just merely stating a fact. I still love High School Musical anyway! Buy the album and movie!!!"
5,"If you're not watching the movie, this is the second best thing","Just like my title says, This is almost better than the movie! If you watch it, and see for yourself, you can tell that the best parts of the film are when everyone starts singing! The only thing I miss when I listen to this, is the acting WHILE they're singing. I've memorized all the songs word for word because they're all so catchy and so meaningful! Not to mention all the singers are awesome! I like to listen to these songs, and imagine it's me singing them, just like Aly & AJ, this is really inspiring!"
4,Love the music! Problem with error's on some CD players,My whole family loves this CD! The only problem we have is that it causes an error on our child's CD player when it gets to a certain song. We can't put the CD on random for that reason but on regular play it ROCKS!
4,"Poppy pop, great!!!","I haven't even seen this flick yet, but while watching Disney Channel they aired a snippet of the music video for ""What I've Been Loooking For"" and I noticed that the girl singer is the one and only Maddie, Ashley Tisdale. So I decided to catch one of the reruns and after doing so the songs are all stuck in my head and I just have to hear them again for some reason. I picked up the disc and even though I ain't a real big fan of the movie, I like the songs. They are so catchy! Definitely recomended. Vanessa can also sing, and she has major hottie potential."
4,High School musical is a terrific CD,The CD was very good. It came with lyrics which is great for singing along. The pictures of the lyrics sheets were fun. After seeing the movie you will want the CD to have so you can play it anytime.
1,High School laughing stock,"This is simply the dumbest movie I have ever seen. The only good thing about it is that it's so stupid that it's funny. I think that someone should inform the dummies that acted that they made a huge fool of themselves. If I were them, I would beg Disney to take back all the orders for the soundtrack and DVD."
3,great for kids,"i liked the review that said that the actor playing ryan was the only talented one. i am 32 and watched this movie for one reason, i work with lucas grabeel's ""ryan"" father and support any work he does 100%. the movie wasn't my cup of tea, more for kids, but it was still great to see lucas do well."
2,purple rain for disney channel?,"the hero of high school musical is really lip sync to hissongs contrast to Prince's real voice in his soundtrack.Girlyplots is a put down, even though it's a made for cable disneymovie.On the the plus side,high school musical is popular ontv and cd like purple rain."
3,Disney! You gave the leads to the wrong people!,"I'll call it like it is. The only reason I bought this was for Ashley Tisdale and Lucas Grabeel's songs (What I've Been Looking For and Bop To The Top) which easily outshine the other music on the album.I find Zac Efron and Vanessa Anne Hudgens voices very mediocre, and sadly they comprise the majority of the CD :( If Ashley Tisdale and Lucas Grabeel were given more songs, this record would easily get a five-star rating.I will now give an individual rating to some of the major songs featured:Start Of Something New-2/10When There Was Me And You-2.5/10Get'cha Head In The Game-5/10What I've Been Looking For-10/10What I've Been Looking For (Reprise) 7/10Bop To The Top-9/10We're All In This Together-7/10 (Would have been better if Ashley and Lucas sang more in it.)3/5"
1,High School Vomitcal,"I'm a really big musical person. I love them so much, so I decided to check this out. Well let me tell you, it STINKS! I mean its a bunch of kids with fake teeny-bopper voices. They try to, but they really can't sing. I mean if your into the whole fake, happy, wooo hooo kinda stuff then this is perfect for you. But if your the kind of person who actually likes musicals DO NOT BUY THIS!! Instead check out something good (ie. Rent or Wicked)!"
5,My 9 year old loves this CD!,My daughter loves the Movie and begged for this CD. She listens to it all the time. She likes most of the songs. Now she is asking for the DVD...
5,Loving it!,My daughter loves this CD. She has watched the movie several times and loves being able to sing along with the CD over and over again. Fun music and finally something appropriate for her to listen to.
2,"""High Scool Musical"" is out!","This year's best selling CD, is ""High School Musical"" which has gotten too much publicity. The soundtrack is OK, the best song is ""Breaking Free"", performed by Zac Efron and Vanessa Hudgens. Ashley Tisdale sounds like she has a robotic voice, its so digital and computerized. But ""The Cheetah Girls 2"" soundtrack is WAYYYY better if you like GREAT music!"
5,The Tiny Pungent Seeds,"Black mustard seeds can be found in only in specialized and ethnic stores. India stores always have it. An indispensable ingredient in Asian cooking, Indian cuisine uses it in various ways. It is sautéed in hot oil until it pops and then other ingredients like vegetables are added. It is a pungent, heating, and somewhat bitter herb. Its black color adds to the look and appeal of curries, and it is anti-vata, according to Ayurveda. In the hot Indian pickles, the powder or whole seeds are added for taste and as a preservative. Available in stores for a much lower price."
2,bored,"A collection of stories set in post-Communist Prague, I thought I'd love the grittiness that must resonate in Hamburger's text. But I quickly grew tired of his lonely characters, each with their sad obsession with sex. Instead of careful observations on love's role in one's identity, his characters' relationships are lust-centered and stray from any further understanding of their personal development.Perhaps it was good erotica if I hadn't been so bored. But that statement in and of itself could lead to a typical Hamburger story. Only his takes longer to tell."
5,A hugely promising debut,"These ten stories, about the lives that intersect in booming '90s Prague, are smart, poignant, and deliciously funny. Aaron Hamburger introduces us to a variety of characters - hopeful Rachel, lonely Donald, understanding Jirka -who are straight and gay, European and American, Jewish and Jew-curious. Each one is indelible. This collection is such a delight, and I find myself rereading the stories and always finding something new in them. I hugely recommend this book."
2,"Sorry Aaron Hamburger, you are no Christopher Isherwood",The characters lack depth. Should have had less stories and focused on developing characters more (like Berlin Stories).
1,Picture It! Too Much Of A Technical Hassle,"This program is difficult to use with Windows 98. Freezes, crashes and error messages are not uncommon. I spent an hour and a half on the phone with the Microsoft Help desk, and even they couldn't get the program running. The Help Desk admitted to me other users have had problems. There is some inherent coding glitch. While the graphics are beautiful, it just wasn't worthe the money or the effort."
1,Picture It Crash,"This program crashed every time I clicked on ""close"" for a picture or ""home"".Eventually I could not get ""Home"" so was barred from ""Get a Picture"". The CD would not permit a reinstallso that ended any further tries."
1,***DON'T BUY IT****,"This program has issues. As I'm not a computer programmer, but have install many applications on to my desk top. Picture it software, will not install correctly. On my initially installation, when trying to launch the program, I too receive error after error. I proceeded to uninstall and reinstall and no luck. I was really excited about this program, because of the Newsletter application. However, instead disappointed that I was not able to use the software. To those of you who research 1st, and buy 2nd, stay away from MicroSoft Picture IT."
4,it was good when it worked,I had the program installed. Then all of a sudden it said the program was corrupted. I tried to reinstal the progrm and itwon't install. Maybe I got a bad cd but the rest of the works 2002 suite installed perfectly. If you use this program get ready for anything can happen.
1,Rubbish,There are two problems with this program. It either doesn't install or it doesn't run. Either way it's a complete waste of money. I've had three different installation discs (none of them worked) and I've tried installing the program on two very high spec machines. I have Picture it 2000 (came with works suite). The 2000 version is excellent. The 2002 version is junk.
5,MAGIC BRONCHIAL TEA,"Absolutely believe in this tea!!! At the first sign of cold or flu symptoms, I take three cups a day. The next day I am as good as new. I take one cup a day now for maintenance. So glad my German friend introduced me to it!!!"
5,Important part of our bedtime routine.,"My daughter got this book for Christmas (she was 3). She and her father read it every night and now she has it memorized. She ""reads"" it to us each night. The illustrations are very cozy, but the best part is the story. The text has a very soothing rhythm. Each page ends with ""Silly ***, it's not time to ***, it's time to go to bed."" I think that when my daughter repeats that phrase over and over, it helps to convince her that it's also time for her to go to bed. :-) After hearing it, I feel ready for bed myself! I think this is going to be one of those books that she's going to remember fondly as an adult, much the way I remember ""Harold and the Purple Crayon"" and ""The 5 Chinese Brothers""."
2,Ease into it,"I drank this tea for the first time several nights ago, which turned out to have been a bad decision. Several hours later, my stomach felt ill and crampy. I wasn't able to feel better or sleep until I threw it back up. Yuck.The taste was okay (the first time), a bit tart but not unpleasant. But I'd suggest trying a half a mug to start with, just to see if you stomach has the same troubles with it that mine did. I don't think I'll be drinking it again."
3,disappointed,"The good part of this single is tracks 2 & 3. The bad part is the bad remix of ""Only Time"". I fell in love with the original album version of ""Only Time,"" and was hugely disappointed when I bought the single and discovered that it was a different version. To add insult to injury, my local jazz station, 95.5 KYOT in Phoenix, used to play the original but for some reason switched to the single version!! As one other reviewer said, the single version has a DJ-like sound to it - NOT what ""Only Time"" was meant to sound like!! The relaxation value has been totally flushed down the toilet."
1,Only Time,"I love enya, but I was dissapointed when I heard the remix version of ""Only Time"".To tell you the truth, it sounds like someone just started to play with different notes on a keyboard.But of coarse her voice is still beutiful in the song. I think they should have left the song how it was.The other is the better version by far."
4,Good song but wierd remix,"This is a really good CD-SIngle of Enya's 2000 hit ""Only Time"".Two versions are on here. The radio version is the regular album version which is really nice and pleasant and the other is a somewhat awkward remix which puts in a DJ sort of rhythm which I must say isn't really all that great.The other song on here is her beautiful rendition of the Christmas classic ""Oiche Chiun"" which is ""Silent Night"" translated into Gaelic.This would be a very good item to own if it weren't for the prohibitive price on here."
2,Only Time/Oiche Chium by Enya,"Can't beat Enya, the problem is this: too costly for only THREE SONGS.I erronerously assumed the others simply weren't listed.My mistake there."
2,Only Time (remix),"A beautiful song. But, the remix was a disappointment. I thought I was getting the original version. I should have read the fine print. This is the first time I ordered anything from Amazon, so I suppose I learned a lesson?"
1,Enya CD,I find it very short - the price is the same as for a full CD. I got my favorite song but the CD length of play is short. As I recall it was only three songs long.
5,Awesome Remix,"I disagree with what everyone else says about this remix. I think the remix adds a beautiful touch to the original. That is the only reason why I want to buy this CD. I have been looking for this song for the longest time and I finally found it on Amazon not knowing she had a special CD with it on. I can't tell you anything about the rest of the CD because I haven't heard it. However, I can tell you this much: the remix is so beautiful that when I hear the original, it feels like it's missing that extra beat and it sounds kind of dull. Nonetheless, the original is still a great piece of art. The remix adds a nice touch!"
3,remix?,"I was looking to buy a single with Only Time, one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard, but was disappointed to learn that the song included on the single Only Time/Oiche Chiun was the remix. I've heard the remix and I find the original is by far better, the rythm is right (too fast in the remix) and the accompaniement is much better, the ""electronic"" music doesn't add anything to the piece. Now I'm not sure I want to buy it...although I would like to have the song around with me."
1,Highly disappointed!,"I didn't get the above-mentioned item. It arrived not on 06.07.2007 but on 29.06.2006, when I was on my business trip. Actually, I was misled by your e-mail to me which said that the book would be delivered within the time interval from 06.07.2007 and 21.07.2007. When I came back from the business trip and tried to take the book from my post office they told me that my item had been already sent back to the sender, that is to your company, I guess."
3,"Those were the days! Things have changed, Eddie Vedder!","When I first heard ""Given To Fly"" on my local modern rock station, I began to catch on to the song. Weeks later, the single ""Wishlist"" was a big smash. I decided I should buy this CD. After getting it, it seemed to suck. Compared to Pearl Jam's ""Ten"", this album was like listening to N'SYNC. It made my head bleed. Here's a tip, don't buy this CD, go watch MTV or something."
2,Why buy when you can turn on the radio and hear it.,"Honest to god, this band has been overplayed on the radio to the point that I cannot stand them anymore. I used to love them like you but the Chinese Water Torture known as FM Radio killed this band for me."
4,Great Album,"Another masterful album from a masterful band. Pearl Jam is an ever changing rock band that has literally changed the face of rock. ""Yield"" is proof the Pearl Jam still has all the talent and greatness that was found in ""Ten."" Any fan of Pearl Jam must have this album as well as any fan of rock."
5,Love this album,"Let's face it, they'll wont be another TEN, but this album is great. I was a little disappointed at first, but I realized it's not 1991 and grunge is over. So I gave YIELD a chance and realized I Loved it. You can't compare it to old school Pearl Jam because these are just different times. Old school Pearl Jam will always be superior just like old school Metallica songs. That's just the way it is."
4,"Somewhat confused, maybe?","Yield is the enigmatic album from Pearl Jam. Do I love it or do I just like it. Well, I guess its both. I like the first song (Brain of J), I kinda but not really like faithfull, feel about the same about No Way, but then, ah yes, right in a row we get Given to Fly, Wishlist, Pilate and Do the Evolution. Then the untitled, and then I kinda like MFC, but I really like Low Light and In Hiding. The last two songs I just plain haven't really gotten into yet, probably haven't given them as much of a chance as I could, but I never seem to find the time. Oh well, no time like the present I guess."
4,Still great after all,"I can't believe how good this CD is. I first got into Pear Jam with Ten and bought all thier reconds until Yield came out. I hated No Code as well as this album. It actually drove me away from the band. A couple of months ago, I went through my PJ catalog, and couldn't believe how this album stood up the test of time. Ten, Vs, etc can't even compete with this album. Six years later, my music tastes matured.If you want good music without all the teen angst, it's well worth it."
5,PEARL JAM IS BETTER THAN ANYONE,Want to know why? listen to this album! it came out in 1998 and shows that Pearl Jam was still the best band in the world ever since 91!
4,Today I wish...,"This is without a doubt one of my favorite PJ efforts. It's dirty, thoughtful, rhythmic, pounding and it rocks.To many cuts to mention, but the openning 4 tracks amaze. And from there, things only evolve.This is a mature progression that I for some reason want to ""group"" with Vitology and No Code. I liked those very much as well, but this to me is superior.The recording has a ""flow"". Each song makes the other even better. Vedder's lyrics are insightful and most importantly...the music makes me ""feel"".""In Hiding"" and ""Pilate"" are my dark horses.Fans of PJ who have not yet gotten this...wait a minute no more."
4,"""Admire me, admire my home, admire my son...HE'S MY CLONE...","""...This land is mine/This land is free/I do what I want/but irresponsibly..."" (""Do The Revolution, 1998)Holy s***, did I just hear what I thought I heard? Had this album not come out 7 years ago I'd swear that was an anti-GWB track from last year (and mind you,kicks the ass of anything off of Green Day's 'politically-minded' American Idiot, no offense). The best art proves its timelessness by being overwhelmingly relevant in the here and now while retaining an uncanny prescience. Pearl Jam has always maintained that level of greatness, and Yield is indeed one of their greatest achievements on record. The most amazing thing to me is how easy and effortless they make it all sound. Definitely an album to own and play over and over (after Ten, and vs., of course, for newbies)."
5,Terrific experiment,"Don't let the title of the review discourage you, ""Vs."" and ""Ten"" fans. It is experimental, but hey...it's Pearl Jam, so it's not like they're screwing anything up. Great album, with a variety of sounds, and the notably rocking ""Do the Evolution"". Buy away, and prepare for some great, original music."
5,"Another amazing CD, where each song is considered a hit.","I think that this CD is a classic interpretation of Pearl Jam's style. I fully recommend this CD to all. I can't say which song is my favorite, because I love them all. Every tune sticks in your head and the words are very meaningfull. Pearl Jam should definitely be praised for another great album."
2,Rushed and Strung Out,"I was really disappointed in this album. The band sounded disjointed and strung out, and Ed Vedder's voice is scratchy and raw -- but not in a good way. The only valuable tracks on this CD are Given To Fly and Wishlist -- the only tracks where Ed and the band really applied themselves; the rest of the tracks just sound like a bad hangover, or just thrown in to complete the album. I think the band rushed into this one, and sounds like they needed a break after touring before they hit the studio. Don't get me wrong, I love these guys, but just wished they would have taken their own advice and given everything they had for the music, not for the fans, because that's why we love them so much."
4,good album,"i was greatful to see PJ back in the day when they were huge.that particular got on the news because of security reasons,too many people.i loved their first album,Ten,which is a classic rock album,loved VS. and Vitalogy.but something happened along the way and i'm really not sure what it was,but i just stopped listening.than recently i picked this up and was over all pleased with it's production.it's not as good as the three albums i mentioned but is still worthwhile.here they continue their experimental ways and Vedder continues his Morrison-inspired lyrics.but i couldn't help thinking that it's Vedder who doesn't match the bands musical talents.a couple of songs i thought would have been better kept as instrumentals.but those songs aren't bad ,nor or any songs here.it's just that it's not perfect nor as memorable as previous outings.if you are a fan of PJ than you should like this.if not than you might like it for the song ""Given to Fly."" overall still, a good production."
4,"Great, could use 1-2 more songs","When I listen to my PJ albums, Yield always leaves me a tad bit unfulfilled. This isn't No Code, but it's a really good album in its own right with some well-known stellar songs (""Wishlist"", ""Do The Evolution"") and some unknown even-better songs (""Pilate"", the poetically weird ""Push Me, Pull Me""). However, when I hit the end I'm left a bit wanting; the disc seems short and could really use another song or two to fill it out. If you're a PJ fan and you don't have this, pick it up by all means; if you're just starting out, you'd prolly be better off getting No Code and Ten/Vs, great examples of the band's current depth and incredible rocking roots."
1,Who Are These Guys?,"I refuse to believe that the same band responsible for ""Ten"" was behind this nearly-unlistenable mess.Eddie Vedder must have gotten sick of people imitating his singing style, so he decided to sing like a demented Tiny Tim on smack in the hopes that no one would bite his style. I think he succeeded.To me, ""Yield"" is an appropriate title, because it's exactly what Pearl Jam has done, realizing that they are no longer musically relevant. You can only wonder if they took their own lyrics seriously when they sing ""I'm not trying to make a difference, I stopped trying to make a difference"" in ""No Way.""I don't know; maybe I'm not a true PJ fan, in that the only two albums I own are ""Ten"" and ""Binaural,"" which IMHO is when they finally got it right again. But I wouldn't take this musical abuse from anyone; that it's coming from PJ just makes it that much worse."
1,"This was their only acceptable record, but Human Clay is vastly superior.",Don't buy this unless you want to turn into a geek machine like the RAWW(...)RRRR man! Go Creed!
2,NOT ALL THAT,"I know it's a matter of perception, taste and expectations but I personally found this recording to be bland, generic, uninteresting and just a low point in their career.""Given to Fly"" due to it's melodic flair, was the only song that peaked my interest of this recording; other than that song, I found YIELD to be a snoozer. Definitely, does not compare to their first two monumental albums."
1,PEARL JAM IS DEAD!,"this cd is more horrible than horrible. Pearl jam just faded away from good music, and that is why you don't hear of them anymore. This cd is like buying something you don't even know about. Pearl jam is a big waste of time."
1,John L. Kowal's review says it all,"This CD is horribly dull. I couldn't stop myself from constantly skipping from track to track again and again because every song had no pep to offer whatsoever, the melodies are boring and the singer; ugh, he's so raspy. I hate the singer and the video for ""Life Wasted"" off their new release, it's so gruesome! I hate how it got to number 1 on MTV2, Pearl Jam shouldn't get radio play or money from people buying their CDs. I haven't liked any song I've ever heard by this awful band. Everything that could have gone wrong did on this album. AAH!"
5,Pearl Jam's catchy lyrics and tunes make this album awesome,"Pearl Jam's catchy lyrics and singable melodies make this album the best yet. Tunes such as Wishlist and Given To Fly are popular songs played on the radio, but there's not a bad song on the album. I reccomend this disc to anyone who likes alterna/grunge/rock music. Definately a five star! Go Pearl Jam!"
4,Their best,"Most people slobber over ""Ten,"" but ""Yield"" is a wonderfully understated album. ""Do the Evolution"" is their best flat-out rocker (coupled with a great video animated by the creator of ""Spawn""), while songs like ""Given to Fly,"" ""Wishlist"" and ""Faithful"" bring out the best in the band. There are a couple of lapses into pretension (""Push Me, Pull Me"" and the red dot song) but Eddie Vedder appears to have rescued himself from his coma."
3,"Overall, not a strong PJ album","Far removed from the emotional charge their early material, This album finds PJ much more laid back - Almost too laid back. At times Eddie sounds tired and off key and the band wander of on quite a number of tracks, trying different styles. This effort is uneven and lacks the great emotional songs of early PJ albums. Its not that I am one of those people stuck at the ""Ten"" era and I like mellow music as well, Its just that there is a lack of killer material here to suck me into this one. ""Long Light"" and ""given to fly"" are the few tracks that stick with me."
5,Best Since Vs.,"This is simply a great album. The songs are written very well, but it is the instrumentals that really make this album put out. I especially liked: Wishlist, Pilate, Do the Evolution, Low Light, and Push Me, Pull Me. Vs. was always my favorite album by PJ, but this almost beats it. What I like best about this album are the interesting instrumentals that are unique to each song and thus never get tiring."
4,"Not as Strong as Ever, but still a MUST buy","""Yield"" is a very good album... I wouldn't go as far as giving it 5 stars but in my opinion, it's a must buy. Nearly every song on the album can be sung along to.. and it's a very good drunken album. For people who say Pearl Jam is losing steam, that couldn't be further from the truth. If Pearl Jam was still an MTV band, they'd be #1 in the world today, as they were back in '91-92."
5,Do the Evolution (again and again and again...),"This album still keeps the Pearl Jam flavor, but sounds more in the vain of a Classic Rock album. In my opinion, it is just as good (if not better than)'Ten' and is much more accessible. Every song is easy to get into and can be listened to over and over again without wearing out. Tracks range from Pearl Jam's signature fast-hard grunge rock (Brain of J, Do the Evolution) to a slower and softer pace (Wishlist, All Those Yesterdays) to strange and experimental (Red Dot, Push Me. Pull Me). I absolutely cannot stop listening to this album."
5,Underrated Classic,"PEARL JAM'S ALBUM ""Yield"" is easily one of, if not, their best. The Album/CD has it all, a cool jacket and great songs. ""All those Yesterdays"" is a brilliant take-off of the Beatles tune ""yesterday"" and ""Pilate"" has a great hook in it. This should have been the follow up to their smash debut album ""10"""
4,True sequel to Vitalogy. Another Excellent PJ Album.,"While ""No Code"" was a great album in it's own way, it was a far cry from the energetic tunes on ""Vitalogy"", the bands third album. ""Yield"" seems like it could be part 2 of ""Vitalogy"". Lots of song variety, heavy songs, fast songs, mellow ballads and what you would have expected from Pearl Jam following their first three hit records. ""Given to Fly"" was a mellow hit single, ""Do the Evolution"" was a heavy rocker that was also a single, and was also the first music video they made since ""Jeremy"", I believe. It was a long time, I know that. ""Faithful"", ""Wishlist"", ""No Way"", ""In Hiding"", and ""Pilate"" are all highlights. I enjoyed this record almost as much as their earlier stuff, and it boasts some of the best songwriting of their careers. If you like ""Vitalogy"", this is probably as close as you can get to that out of their newer stuff. This album is already 9 years old, but as with all PJ, it ages extremely well."
3,HAVE YOU HEARD...,"This CD has a number of very contageous tracks. It'll give you some quite hard and bangish jams, as well as a few nostalgic, sweet tunes. You might have heard a song from this album on your radio, and maybe not. But if what you're looking for is just plain music that your soul will enjoy if you listen, bon appetite."
5,Some of their greatest work,"Pearl Jam just hasn't stopped putting out great albums. Yield is magnificient from start to finish. Some call it a comeback.....from what No Code was good, whether you'll admit it or not. Gossard is the king of this album with the 3 best songs; No Way, Do the Evolution (I've got a few speeding tickets with that pure adrenaline rush playing), and All Those Yesterdays (He also wrote In Hiding, but its not worth mentioning). McCready also wrote some great ones like Brain of J,(which really kicks off the record great!!)Faithful, and Given to Fly. Ament also puts in his two cents with Pilate,(good song but what is he talking about??)Low Light, and Push me, Pull me (which is kind of a strange one, but I think very catchy). Vedder also hit right on with Wishlist, (great content, but can get annoying sometimes)and MFC. This record has no weak links. Yield and Vitalogy stand as PJ's brightest stars!! Also buy some ... they are amazing!!!"
3,krista,"this C.d is their triumphant return. it's fairly dood but slightly odd (EX. REd Dot) Good Songs are low light, difference, givin to fly and all those YEsterdays"
5,One of my favorite albums ever!,"I have been a fan of Pearl Jam since their first appearance on MTV... but never loved their music enough in the beginning to buy it... though I thought it was really good music. On some odd chance I bought Yield and quickly fell in love with every track on the album. I think that they have ignored the popular themes in the market to come up with stuff that is truly original and powerful. Damn good album... if you like ""alternative"" or ""rock"" or anything along the lines of that I'd recommend this album/CD highly!"
4,Pearl Jam - rock's hardest working band,"For all of the grief this band has endured over the last eight years, it's amazing they have been able to stay together and thrive. ""Yield"" shows them to have struck a balance between the quiet, melodic side and their inner grunge Id, and it makes for a rewarding album. Occassionally baffling, but always affecting (see ""Given to Fly"" and ""In Hiding,"") ""Yield"" is the sound of a band refusing to cave to trends, still searching, yet confident enough to make a great, big sounding rock album. Bravo."
5,The world would be a better place if...,"Everyone owned a copy of this album! Yield is great from start to finish, as it is (in my opinion) the epitome that a band like Pearl Jam works for, sort of like their Joshua Tree. This album is definatley one of my favorite works of all time and is tied with Ten (and on occasion Vitalogy) to be my favorite Pearl Jam album (even though I kind of hate having favorites). With songs like In Hiding, Given to Fly, Faithfull, Brain of J, No Way, Wishlist, MFC and Do the Evolution you will at least have your moneys worth!"
2,skip,"I never quite understood the appeal of this album, or the appeal of most of the popular Pearl Jam albums for that matter. It seems the more popular a Pearl Jam album is, the more likely I am to think the album isn't quite as good as one of the bands less popular efforts. Yield is a fine example of that.Something about the vocal melodies on this particular effort strike me as unsatisfying for the most part. Pearl Jam is (or was) certainly capable of creating a mighty fine album when they wanted to. Problem is, Yield doesn't show me any of the bands finer qualities.Yield doesn't strike me as an album you should own, and just like Ten, it's my belief the two albums both have something in common- they are both overrated because the vocal melodies are weak, and the songwriting isn't up to the bands usual high standards."
3,Gypsy Jazz,"Sharp, crisp tunes and a vivacious jazz accordion. Uptempo and punchy for the most part and toe tappingly enlivening. Very cool."
4,Blast Off Into This Good Book,"The book I read was The Wonderful flight to the Mushroom Planet. Most of the story takes place on the planet Basidium. Two boys, Chuck and David, answer an ad to save the people on Basidium. Do they figure out the problem and save them? Read to find out!I liked this book because of how it explained things so well. It gave very good descriptions."
3,Okay For Little Kids (under 9.),"The characters are David, Chuck and Mrs. Pennyfeather. They are going to the Mushroom Planet. They are going because: the mushroom people need sulfur. Otherwise they will die! Sulfur is in Mrs. Pennyfeather's eggs. It ends when they leave Mrs. Pennyfeather at the Mushroom Planet because the Mushroom people will then stay alive."
3,This Book Is Out Of This World!,"I read the Wonderful Fight to the Mushroom Planet by Eleanor Cameron. It takes place in Chuck and David hometown and on Basidium. This is a book about 2 boys, David and Chuck. David finds an ad in the newspaper looking for a ship and 2 kids. They make a ship and they fly to Basidium. They bring along Mrs. Pennyfeather. She is a chicken. I liked this book because it interesting. Do they return? Read to find out!"
3,Memorable,"This book was read to me when I was seven years old, and I never forgot the wonderful impression it made on me. Unfortunately, as an adult (I am now 39), it had lost some of its luster. A second tragedy: My son keeps falling asleep! I still believe in the book and look forward to reading it to my second son."
4,A long-lost treasure regained: sans-drawings...,"I read this and other Mushroom Planet books as a child. I had forgotten the titles until a couple of years ago when I discovered the book during a Parent's Night at my son's elementary school. I read the book to my son who was 6 at the time. One thing I noticed is that the author's sentence constructions are particularly difficult to read aloud. The current published versions claim Robert Henneberger as the illustrator, but none of the in-print versions (that I can find) are illustrated! This is especially sad, as the drawings of the spaceship, Mr. Bass, and his laboratory were a lot of the appeal to me as a child."
2,Fine - (for most people,"I read a book called The Mushroom Planet, by Eleanor Cameron. It takes place in the city and on the planet. Two boys named Chuck and David go to a planet. They are supposed to save the planet from starvation and sickness. But did they save it? Read to find out! I liked it because it is adventurous."
2,Go Read Some Other Book.......................,"I read The Wonderful Flight to The Mushroom Planet By Eleanor Cameron. It takes place at Basdium. David and Chuck build a rocket ship. Mr. Bass used it for stuff. The Mushroom People did not have enough food. Chuck and David were suppose to save the Mushroom People. Did they save them, yes or no? Read more to find out. I disliked this story because I like to read about animals a lot more."
3,Just okay.,I Didn't realize it was a discarded library book. It is okay though. Maybe the seller said so in the description and I missed it. Not likely to hold up long.
5,Wonderful flight still Wonderful after 40 years,"A friend of mine is on the local school board and was collecting books to give to young children. She asked if I would donate my favorite book to the cause. When I told her about the ""Wonderful flight to the Mushroom Planet"" she had never heard of it. I'm so glad I was able to get this book and share it with another generation."
5,"Regarding the sequels to ""Wonderful Flight"".","Like many of the reviewers below, I loved this book as a child; was delighted to find it and read it again as an adult; and was pleased to introduce my children to the book. So there's just one reason for me to add my review: commenting on the sequels that some others have mentioned. My view is that the reader should stop after the first book. The first sequel is barely okay; the ones that follow don't measure up. Only the original ""Wonderful Flight"" has the magic."
5,Come On And Blast Off To READ!!!!!,"I read The Wonderful Flight to the Mushroom Planet. It take's place in Chuck and David's hometown and Basidium. Chuck and David go into space. Chuck and David saw Ta. They left him the hen and the eggs. Mr. Bass's people on Basidium were getting sick because they were drinking the water. The water had things they needed and didn't need so they got sick. Read on to find out if Chuck and David saves Basidium and its people!!! I liked it because, it was about space, and I like space."
4,Very well-written and interesting book for young readers,"I loved this book! I have read it countless times and still keep it in my bookcase. It is wonderful: the plot is tight, the characters well developed, and the suspense more than enough to keep one interested. As soon as I read it the first time, I knew I had to read the sequel. I thought, though, that the over-all feel of the book was not enough for beginning readears, but I still think anyone with any taste for science fiction or suspense books should absolutely read this book."
5,Excellent quick reference!,"The book is divided into 70+ short articles which makes it very easy to read. One can quickly jump to a subject of his interest.. ranging from pre-production, lighting and sound, camera and directing techniques, desktop editing, etc. A lot of valuable tips and tricks provided.There is a ""sidebar"" section in most every article where some real-life examples are given.In terms of post-production, it is suitable for people using Adobe Premiere and Final Cut Pro."
4,Good reference book from a great magazine,"I've been a fan and subscriber of Videomaker magazine for years and this book is an excellent compilation of recent articles and how-to's on all aspects of video production. I like that they have added information on DVD authoring to this edition, too. My only criticism is that it would be much better if it was illustrated in four color rather than black and white."
3,Just OK,"I bought these but have yet to use them regularly. The heat strip will show the need for ""caution"" all the way to the top (no matter how much milk is in it) after using a warmer bcoz the steam from a warmer (of course) rolls up the outside. Nipple is NOT for newborns."
1,lg chocolate wall charger,this product is cheap for the price but it broke after a week. i wouldn't recommend buying this at all.
1,Answer To Below Review,"To address the review regarding Douglas Adams' email address, the answer is simple: Michael Levine puts about as much thought into his books as he does trying to gain publicity for his clients: NONE! Believe me, Levine doesn't know how to get in touch with any celebrities--he hasn't represented one since he split from another PR company and formed his own.Don't waste any money on this book. If you want to contact a celebrity, just do a little research online and you can find out what company represents them, and send your mail through them. That will help you to avoid getting back a bunch of letters marked RETURN TO SENDER that you will get if you use the addresses in Levine's lame book."
3,good BUT!,good book but i have already found many addresses that are incorrect or have just changed. Author states that the book INCLUDES hundreds of E-mail addresses but has forgotten his own! You can write him with new addresses but it would be nice for him to update the new addresses online for those who purchased his book.
5,Rolodex in a Book,"A great, handy reference book, ""The Address Book: How to Reach Anyone Who Is Anyone"" by Michael Levine is a helpful book for anyone looking to write celebrities, politicians, businessmen, and other notable personalities.Each contact is alphabetized by last name, and contains the address, person's occupation, and in some cases, birthdays (for celebrities only) and webpages (for companies). As an avid letter writer, I found this book helpful in providing me with addresses at demand instead of hunting them down through the Internet by doing searches or going to company webpages.A great book many will find resourceful, ""The Address Book: How to Reach Anyone Who Is Anyone"" will help many find the contact information they seek without the need for a major Internet search or many telephone calls. It makes a great gift for students, business professionals, and for anyone who avidly writes letters."
3,Prior History,"I work in an elementary school and many students have used prior address books written by Mike Levine. We have had some success with the books, and while we understand that addresses change and mail can easily be returned, I have one criticism. In some of the prior books, I have had mail returned right away marked ""undeliverable"" or ""address no longer valid"" etc.I think Mr. Levine should send letters to every address in his book before putting it in the next edition. I have been very surprised to buy later editions, only to discover the same address that had not been valid several years before - yet it is still offered as the address for book purchasers to attempt to write to the individual listed. This is poor planning and poor research, in my opinion.We have had some success with many of the addresses, however, and I am going to buy this book again."
2,Not impressed...,I used this book for a project. I got tons of return to sender letters back and the few that made it through went to offices. I don't think it was worth it...Maybe the newer edition is better...???
1,"Beautiful movie, horrible dvd quality....","I can only repeat what Tony Polito wrote. I was talking with a friend and virtually quoted Tony's review (prior to reading it, that is).The reason I bought this DVD was because I had just seen the movie on DirecTV HDTV. What a difference. This DVD is a quality disaster. Do not waste your money.I am now looking for a HDTV source version DVD."
4,Very good but could be better,"I've seen this movie many, many times. With much better subtitles. This particular version is poorly translated. Many typos and incorrect English. It was obvioulsy translated by someone with lilmited knowledge of English. The quality of the picture is not great. It's grainy. However, I still like it and it's worth buying."
1,Such a shame,"For years I've been a fan of Asian cinema, and this movie is among my favorites. I, like many others, have waited for years for this film to be released on DVD. What an insult to the fans that this gorgeous film was transfered so poorly. The amount of snow and scratches makes it hard to see what's going on, and the adequate subtitles on the VHS release were aparently translated into Swahili, then into Klingon, back into Chinese and then into English again.The distributor of this piece of garbage owes an apology to everyone (including myself) who bought this trash. I'm only considering keeping this thing until a better version comes out."
1,Classic film - Horrible DVD!,"""Raise the Red Lantern"" is justifiably recognized as one of the great films of the Nineties and one of the most visually striking movies of all time. Unfortunately this DVD release by Razor Digital Entertainment is a travesty. The colors are dull and washed out and the English subtitles are poorly translated, ruining the stately mood of the movie. This is not how a classic film should be watched! Hopefully a legitimate DVD company like Criterion will decide to release the movie with a properly done transfer. In the meantime, avoid this hideous DVD at all costs."
5,The five stars is for the movie itself - the DVD version gets none,"I am appalled that I had to wait so long for what is more or less a bootleg version of this wondeful film. I could've gotten this from a street vendor in NYC (or Ebay for that matter) years ago if I didn't care about the picture, sound or subtitles; I've seen anime bootlegs that are better than this! I applaud the reviewer who complained to the company about the release and I certainly hope that a better DVD master will be made."
2,Boot-leg City,"This movie is a visual feast, it's also a great story. The scenery, and music is incredible.But this DVD version is a complete farce. If I hadn't seen the film so many times before on a VHS with FAR better subtitles, I would have been COMPLETELY confused. ""Stop being so groovy"" an actress complains in one scene! Whatever happened to quality control?. Is the American audience so starved for good film that it will buy/sell such a mediocre product? The audio isn't in true stereo, and the video is blotchy. How could a film so great be treated SO cheaply? Buy the VHS and copy it to DVD if you want to understand the plot."
1,Duped,"I already owned a bootleg copy that had a 1:85 ratio to provide for old hard-to-read subtitles. The sound is skewed to one channel and the print was average. Compared to the horrible print that this new DVD features my bootleg looks like a masterpiece. I join the many opinions here that this DVD is unwatchable with the blurry image, the burn spots and the scratches that appear at the begining and end of every reel (every 15-20 mins) and the wierd noises from the damaged optical sound from the print. Find a bootleg."
4,"Excellent - Young Gong Li, tensions, intrigue, futility","This movie captures the tensions and intrigues in the household among the various concubines. Through Gong Li's superb acting the audience also gets a sense of the futility and inability to escape this life of strict custom that has been followed ""for many generations"". One gets the sense that the young 4th Mistress (played by Gong Li) wants to break free from tradition but is unable to due to rigidity of this time period. Beautiful costumes; cinematography of the closed spaces in the house reflects the closed life of the characters in the film, particularly the women. Overall, excellent acting by a young Gong Li and the supporting actress who plays the 3rd Mistress. A superb film by director Zhang Zimou (who later directed the beautiful Curse of the Golden Flower). Hadn't seen this in almost 10 years but still wonderful as I remembered it the first time..."
5,Disturbing,"My review will only be about the movie, not the dvd quality. Like all Gong Li movies this one leaves you with a disturbed feeling at the end. Gong Li is such a beautiful woman and when the wives and servants are at each other in this world where men rule it is hard to imagine such a place. It is a very good movie and leaves you with a feeling similar to the end of Farwell my Concubine. I love all Gong Li movies but I can only watch most one time because of the way the movie makes you feel, sort of disturbed and bothered."
3,Sexual Servitude,"Raise the Red Lantern is an interesting movie. It is a slow progression of an old topic, one of sexual servitude to a powerful man. The film centers around the women who are enslaved by this man, but he is never really shown in the movie. Red Lantern is about the women's personal relationships with the other woman in his group and how he replaces them when they outlive their usefulness."
1,The Quality to DVD is Appalling!,"Raise the Red Lantern is a wonderful movie with a great story. When I had heard that this movie was going to be transfered to DVD format, I was thrilled. And then I bought the DVD, and to my dismay, within the first couple of minutes into the movie, there were white lines and distortion. Since I loved the movie so much, I thought I would make an exception for the first few minutes, but as the movie continued, so did the white lines. I could not believe what I was seeing. The DVD copy of this movie, reminded me of the old movies I use to see years ago, when there were only 7 channels on TV.And not only is the visual appearance of this movie distorted so is the sound. It's very harsh and nasally.I am on my way out the door to return this DVD and ask for a refund."
1,"Great film, shockingly bad dvd","Raise The Lantern is a superb film by a very talented director, starring a wonderful lead actress. This DVD release (along with Ju Dou from the same company) is simply one of the worst DVDs I have ever seen - and I've seen some of the worst the format has to offer. How any company can justify releasing such a shoddy product is beyond me - it must take some effort to make the film look even worse than it does on VHS or the import from China. Amazon should refuse to sell it."
1,poor transfer,"As much as I think this a wonderful movie, which I've watched many times both on its original release and on vhs, this has to be the worst dvd transfer I've ever purchased. Not only is the image scratched and snowy, the subtitles, not the same as the vhs, are appallingly bad. If the release company is going to market this as a 'collection' by the director, then it could have made some minimal effort to preserve the integrity of the film."
2,I love this movie but not this copy,The translation is so messed up on this copy. Dont waste your money. Like others I also own it on VHS. I would rather watch my VHS copy. Also there is a lot of snow on this copy. Poor transfer as well as the the poor translation.
1,Beautiful movie! Horrible DVD!,Don't waste your time with this release if you are thinking of adding this classic to your collection. Atrocious translation and film to disk transfer.
1,Excellent Film - Horrible DVD,"The video tape was fine. They have re-subtitled it in illiterate English. The video is so atrocious it could easily pass for a cheap ""pirated"" copy. I am aghast that such an item could be marketed.The film is superb; one of modern China's film industry masterpieces. Hopefully someone will transfer this properly to DVD format."
3,horrible subtitles for a fabulous movie,"I've been waiting for years for this to be released on DVD. I can't express how disappointed I am by the poor film quality, but worst of all, the useless subtitles.When played on cable, this movie was subtitled beautifully. I have no idea why it was resubtitled for DVD release. The English is so poor that the film is almost unintelligable. The spelling, grammar, and syntax are hideous.If they were going to make us wait so long for the DVD release of this film, why on earth didn't they use someone even remotely literate to do the translations?The likelihood of this being re-released at any point is slim. Try to catch it on cable, if you can, because there's no way to get the full value of this remarkable and beautiful film the way they've released it in this format.So disappointing"
5,A Wonderful Film,"The first time I saw this movie, I was sort of annoyed by the way the Master of the House treated his wives with the expectation that they will be available to him at his whim. But as I watched it more and more, I began to realize that even though there was a strong cultural tradition to behold amongst those within the household, each wife had to maintain her own salvation in a fierce competition for the Master's attention more so than love. And the master did nothing to encourage harmony within this household. The jealousy shown by Mistress #2 only lead to lies, deception and eventually murder. The movie is beautifully done and I especially like the way the seasons are depicted to add some sense that with each comes a new beginning, fresh start. But we are quickly fooled. I highly recommend this movie for all to see."
4,Culture,I had to watch this video for an English class in college. I think this movie shows the different culture from another country and the way things are.
1,Complain against Amazon.com,"I am not reviewing the quality of the move. When I received the DVD, I could hear that the sound of the disk moving in the box i.e. it had not been properly locked in. Sure enough, when I looked at the disk, I saw scratches all over the disk. I hade emailed to Amazon telling them my problem. And, I did not receive any response. Instead, I receive a computer generated reply which does not address my problem.I want a new DVD of the movie to be sent to me. I am so disappointed by the lack of attention in such an organisation.By the way, I also have a complaint about another movie ""The Story of Qiu Ju"" which I had ordered in the same batch. You can see this in my review on the movie"
1,One of the worst movies I ever saw,"I HATE when that happens. You watch a film and boy, is it bad. But you keep watching, thinking it HAS to get better because NOTHING can be THIS BAD!So you hold on, and hold on just a bit longer straining to see things turn around. Then BAM ! The WORST part of all happens & it's over at the same time.Aarrgggghhhh. Now, all you have are REGRETS you ever came by the stupid movie in the first place, & wishes you could erase it from your memory banks.Sigh. Live. Make mistakes. (Hopefully)Learn & avoid the same mistake in the future... and when you have opportunity: do what you can to help others not repeat your painful costly error.Do yourself a favor watch something else. Something with Jackie Chan, perhaps... or the wonderfully romantic mini-series At the Dolphin Bay (you can see previews on youtube. :)"
1,....gimme a break,Unfortunately for me I had seen this flick. Chinese movies never connected to real life as freedom of speech is directive from Communist party and to understand it you have to move to China and experience reality and this is why the movie set up in 1920 as it safe. Movie is also boring as it possibly could be. Brrrrr...
2,"WE'VE WAITED SO LONG FOR THIS ON DVD, BUT....","I've been waiting for ""Raise the Red Lantern"" on DVD for quite awhile. It is good to finally see it available. However, this transfer is very disappointing. First of all, the print is not restored. In fact it's not a new one! This one's been shown many times in some cinema somewhere with scratches and all. Also the ""Surround"" sounds more like mono to me. And worse of all, in 2006, it's ""widescreen"" but not ""Anamorphic"" nor ""Enhanced"" for widesceen televisions. I still have my Laser Disc of this fim which is ""Pan and Scan"", but at least it's a new print and in real ""Surround"" sound! This is a stunning film visually and a wonderful story. It's a shame someone didn't do it justice. Keep an eye out for a new mastering one of these days. Hey, Criterion! Are you listening?"
5,Chinese Drama,"Excellent insight into some Chinese culture. Excellent acting and tugs at the human heart strings in telling a story of poverty, riches, betrayal, love, hate and madness. Gong Li is well respected in Asian cinemas and has had a fruitful career. Watching this one can see why."
5,Fascinating film/story,"The story depicted in this film is an accurate account of how life was for many Chinese women in ancient times. It is an amazing tale of courage, deception, jealousy, resiliency, and revenge, told in a story that captures the imagination. The depth of spirit in the characters is striking. Photography and direction is absolutely superb. This is the type of film that lingers within the soul."
1,Disgrace,How could such a beautifull movie be treated so badly? The picture and sound quality are as terrible as the reviews here suggest. Simply no reason to spend your money on such a poorly produced product. [...]
1,travesty of a great film,"This is one of my favourite films so my expectations of the DVD release were high. Sadly though its transfer to DVD is appalling - the picture quality is so poor it resembles a pirate copy and the subtitles are so badly translated that they would be laughable if they didn't ruin such a fine film. (What is a 'forth wife'? Why is the master of the household so often referred to as 'the mister'? Who thinks 'come-on in, come-on in' is natural English?) It's the worst subtitling I have seen in 25 years. This film really deserved a great deal better. And Amazon oughtn't to sell a product of such dubious quality."
2,Poor translation of a fantastic movie,"Raise the Red Lantern is a great movie. The story is intriguing and the filming and acting are superb. Unfortunately, this version of the movie is quite poorly done. The subtitles are often incoherent, with incorrect words and grammar. I know this movie quite well, and there were several times when I not only coudn't understand the subtitle, I couldn't even take a guess at what it was supposed to be about. I was really looking forward to this new DVD edition and was very disappointed."
3,Dramatic but depressing drama,"This movie was no doubt, very dramatic. However, I was expecting more girl power. The whole movie seems to be a display of ow these women were victimized by their husband and the petty games they played to feel in control. In the end, they all seem to succumb to hardships of their situation. Some people may find the drama entertaining, but I just found it depressing."
1,Worst job of copying a film onto DVD ever ...,"I could not be more disappointed by the poor quality of this film -- not only didn't they bother restoring the print -- which is grainy, scratchy and of poor color quality -- they also inexplicably plugged in new subtitles, which are riddled with misspellings, typos and poor grammar. ""Forth mistress"" instead of ""fourth mistress,"" or laughably, ""savant"" instead of ""servant,"" which isn't the only example of how the meaning of a line changes thanks to the lazy, slipshod job of whomever was in charge of bringing this otherwise beautiful story to DVD. If you love this movie, or even films in general, you'll only be left angry and frustrated after viewing this low-rent excuse of a DVD. Razor Digitalent, the California-based company listed on the DVD as the distributor, should be ashamed."
2,The movie is great the DVD copy is TERRIBLE,"This is a really great movie, bittersweet, sad and just wonderful acting. I was really excited to have to come out on dvd finally. HOWEVER, this DVD version is absolutely DREADFUL, it is all scratchy and poppy, it looks like someone just did a really rough copy from an old vhs tape and put it onto the DVD, it needed a lot of remastering and it didnt get that. I hope someone else releases a better version of it soon."
1,Wish I had waited before buying this DVD.,"I fell in love with this movie when it aired on cable and even recorded it on my VCR, carefully pausing out the commercials. When Amazon notified me it had become available on DVD, I ordered it. I wish I had waited and seen these reviews before buying. I agree with everything said about the DVD's (lack of) quality; if this version had been my introduction to the movie, I would not have fallen in love with it. This is one DVD that's a definate down-grade instead of an upgrade. I'm keeping my VHS version."
1,"The film is great, the DVD transfer really does suck that bad!","I, too, eagerly awaited this film to be released on DVD. Unfortunately, it has the quality of a video camera being pointed at an old, scratched copy in a movie theatre. You can literally see the edge of the screen and the misregistration of the film as it passes. It wobbles. The colors are very contrastly, just like a bad video camera. The sound is okay.The film, when seen in a theatre, is ever as haunting as some of the scenes in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, but the meaning of the red lanterns, and their ominous presence, is completely lost in this version. How sad.If you can get your hand on the VHS copy, you'll be getting a better copy."
2,Raise The Red Lantern,"I have to agree witrh the negative comments about this release. It is a wonderful movie, beautifully shot and ruined by the distributor. It looks like a fifteenth generation copy developed in sand! What a shame!"
3,Easy and Enjoyable Read,"It is a great historical fiction, romance novel about the Civil War from the slaves point of view. It was easy to read, quick, but entertaining. There is a strong Christian influence and reference throughout the story. It also has a wonderful love story, loving someone else, as well as loving thyself."
2,"Not preachy, but...","The good news first: Without preaching, Mrs. Austin manages to share her powerful message in a personal and realistic way. God never deserts the characters, even when they are in dire straits and renouncing Him. However, this is simply not a strong work of fiction. The dialogue varies from mostly believable to painfully modern, and the prose is less than captivating. The general scope of the novel is good, the characters have promise, but the writing itself is simply not up to par. It's a shame that this really is one of the best representatives available of modern Christian historical fiction; the people of God should set the standard for the rest of the world, not come off as second best."
5,"No quisiera ser repetitivo, amigos,","pero la verdad es que los libros de inglés de Maribel son de tanta calidad que cada uno de ellos bien merece un reconocimiento...Y este, no es la excepción:ESPLÉNDIDO !"
4,Chekov meets Altman,"Terrific ensemble type film with four stories overlapping. Loved Peter Falk as the old drunk. A role he has waited his entire life to play. Also, the story about the girl watching her own baby is heart breaking to say the least."
1,Very confusing,"I think this book is very confusing and just not a good children's book. It certainly isn't one that you can read to your kids.The idea is that the fish need to go on a ""treasure hunt"" from one page to the next. On each page, there are ""clues"" that are hidden by flaps the reader lifts up. After reading all the clues, you're supposed to understand what's going on and then proceed to the next page.The problem is that there is no real direction, and some of the ""clues"" under the flaps don't really mean anything. Not only that, but there's no real mystery. You just look under the flaps and turn the page. The reader doesn't have any decisions to make.The worst part is at the end. The ""treasure"" is just a statement saying that one of the characters is going to talk about his adventures. That's it! You don't actually get to read these adventures.There lots of other great Rainbow Fish books out there. Don't disappoint your child by buying this one."
1,"did not translate to Kindle well, look for paper version","This review is of the Kindle version of the Scaduto biography. The original book is 5 star read; the Kindle version is not, because the text is full of nonsense characters instead of alpha. Having read the original Scaduto biography of Dylan in hard cover in 1973, I was delighted to find this Kindle version, which has a bonus - biographic updates into the 1980s. However, I was very disappointed with the quality of the Kindle conversion. Words with accented letters, such as cliche and deja vu, were corrupted throughout the work. And the last couple chapters of the Kindle edition - the 1980's updates - had dozens of corrupt characters per page in place of apostrophes, quotation marks, etc. What should have been a great read was full of distracting e-flaws. Avoid this Kindle version. Instead, search out a used copy of the original hard or paper editions."
4,VALUABLE RESOURCE,"Although there are some dubious sources for this work, overall it gives a fascinating insight into the development of the Bob Dylan persona. I wish that someone would write such book following up to the present day. The reader needs to bear in mind that Dylan thought a lot of this book untrue!"
1,!!!! I STRONGLY DISCOURAGE PURCHASING ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY!!!!!,"I've orderd Ear Cone Candles Beeswax - 4 - Pack here to Iraq, where one of my soldiers is suffering from swimmers ear due to sweat. I have orderd this product over a month ago. along with another item, from a different company the same day.the other item got here in about a week...standard time for products off Amazon.com.today, 1 month later...my soldier still has swimmers ear, and there is nothing we can do about it, accept let him stay MORE uncomfortable than he already is.It is pretty outrageous the amount of time it is taking. looks like i will order the same product again, but not from these guys...."
2,It's ok,This book is ok but did not hold me that well. Dr. Gregory is a FANTASTIC preacher but the book is not nearly as good as his preaching.
3,"Good message, but...","This is a great book, the message is on point. However, I had to weed through several typographical errors. I also found that the writer used a great number of million dollar words when 25 cents words would have worked just fine. I just my opinion, but I think a communicator should strive to convey his/her message on a level where it can be grasped by even the simplest minds."
3,Use Some Caution,"The books is worth a read and in some respects is very informative and interesting. It would carry more weight if one knew something of Mr Budden and his credentials. Mr. Budden, I fear, makes the common error of coming up with an idea and then interpreting everything so as to bolster that idea. The excessive use of ""it may, perhaps, it would seem and other such expressions does not lend itself to proven statements of fact. Mr. Budden ignores much that would refute or disagree with his conclusions. One can argue for almost any point of view if one is selective. This does not say that the book is without merit for there is much to ponder in what he suggests. Desmond R. Call"
5,"cover to cover, as a referance","The authors of this book are very honest to light on and/or cover every topic you need or you search for, soon or later whatever your level in visual basic"
1,"Don't read it, even if you get it for free.","I saw this book in the bargin book section of the computer store so I picked it up. It is HARD to find a good book on VB and this book is no exception. It has no depth. Each tip starts with the words ""In Tip xxx, you learned blah, blah, blah"". The author loves to call UDTs, structures. This isn't C, its Visual Basic. In one example (350 something). The author gives actual C code for a structure and doesn't tell us it's not VB code."
4,Good tutorial of Visual Basic for anyone learning VB,"I've been programming in basic for years, stepping up to Visual Basic is much easier with that background. This book has many nice tips in it for anyone who is collecting information on VB. I just purchased his source code book and will comment about that later. Anyone serious about programming knows that you'll be picking up many books on the programming topic before you could write one. Even then, usually you won't be able to keep up with the software house's next version! Rp"
3,A Beginner's Dream,"The first book on the language that you should get? Maybe. But if you're looking for advanced and ""pushing the envelope"" stuff, you're better off somewhere else. Every topic starts off great, but falls short when it comes to examples. They show the proper format for each line of code, but no real-world examples. It's like if they couldn't write some code themselves and only copied what the Help file already teaches you. The CD is useless. There are many options out there and this one is around the middle of my list."
1,Title is misleading - content is repetitious.,"This is not a tips and tricks book - it is an introductory VB programming book. Because it's broken down into 1001 small bits, the same information is often repeated in many places. It also feels like they had to stretch to get to the magic number of 1001."
5,A Good CD,"I only noticed this cd after one of my friends told me about it, but I'm glad that she did, because this cd is definitely worth it. My personal favorite song on the cd is ""Say A Little Prayer For You"", the cast version. Though it isn't much like the movie version (which was a lot better, I think due to the way it was performed), its a great song, and even funnier to listen to with this version. The reggae version is pretty good too. I also enjoyed ""Wishin and Hoping"", which is just a nice song. However, I think to understand what the meaning of the songs are (to this soundtrack), you need to see the movie, so I recommend that you see the movie, and then take the time to appreciate the soundtrack."
3,Not Quite Like The Music In The Movie,"I love watching movies and then purchasing the soundtracks shortly after I can't stop singing the music on the movie. I purchased this soundtrack recently and let me tell you that it is good but I was somewhat disappointed. I think that the songs are very soothing and nice, but not quite what was in the movie. I guess what I was looking for was a lot of what I heard during the movie, the cast singing and things like that. Some good advice before buying, keep in mind that if you are looking for something closer to what is heard on the movie, this is not exactly it. If you like the music in the movie in general and do not care about how it is played as long as you get the same words, then you should buy the soundtrack.In general I was very disappointed that it was not closer to what is featured in the movie, but it has several classics in there for those of you who are looking for that sort of stuff. Good luck on your purchase."
1,Not the Real Deal,"Not only are the songs on this album NOT by the original artists, but they are not particularly well done imitations. My husband and I listened to this CD twice just to confirm our first impressions, and then we tossed this puppy so it wouldn't take up room meant for CDs worth our time and money. Putting a CD like this on the market is criminal."
4,Listened to it again and again,"The soundtrack contained various artists singing about finding love in a friend. My favorite song was the ""My Best Friend's Wedding"" symphony. In this score the piano playing was wonderful and I wished the that music could last for more than two minutes.The song, ""Say a Little Prayer"" sung by the cast was good also. I thought the actor singing it was not bad considering his profession in acting, not singing. I liked the assorted music in this CD and I listened to it more than ten times!"
5,cool,i liked the cd alot i expesily like number 4 i love that song me and my dad maid a dance to the song.
1,This soundtrack SUCKS!,"One of the most annoying things about this soundtrack, and others, is that the songs as they were performed in the movie is not what is recorded on the CD. It was the songs as they were sung in the movie that made me want to buy the CD. I want a soundtrack that has the actors singing the songs as they did in the movie to give me that same ""feeling"" that the movie did. ""I say a little prayer"" and ""I just don't know what to do with myself"" were much better performed by the actors in the movie. On this soundtrack they are extremly irritating because they do not come from the movie as the word ""soundtrack"" implies."
4,Well done soundtrack,"The more I listen to this CD the more I like it! Of course, I've been a Dione Warwick fan for years, so other artists singing her songs took a a few times through to get used to, but otherwise I've been quite pleased with my purchase! I agree with one of the other posters that the movie version of ""Say a Little Prayer"" can't possibly be topped by the CD, but still it's an enjoyable CD and well worth the purchase."
1,Dreadful!,"I, like one of the other reviewers, listened to this once and tossed it in the trash. I realized when I bought it that a number of the songs were not performed by the original artists, and should have been warned right away....."
5,Christmas present,"Christmas time and last minute shopping this worked good for us as a gift for our daughter in law, thanks Amazon.com"
4,Good but not great,"In my humble opinion, the music quality and soundwas good but not great. In that regard, the soundtrackwould probably have been a better choice. However, thealbumn features hard-to-find songs. I purchased the CDbecause of the song choices and I'm glad I did."
4,"Old Friends, Good Times","I bought this CD strictly for the song ""If You Wanna Be Happy"". You know, the song that cautions about making a pretty woman your wife. I needed the song for a PowerPoint presentation/gameshow I was doing in honor of my husband's 50th birthday/LIRR retirement party. (Yes, he did make the mistake, early in our marriage, of casually agreeing with the advice in the song! He has since learned not to voice those opinions.)I found myself pleasantly surprised by the eclectic selection of songs and have downloaded it to my Zume. It is nice to hear some of the oldies again and remember what you were doing when they were first popular. It makes for a nice nostalgia trip. Poor yourself a glass of wine, kick back and reminisce."
2,My Best Friend's Wedding: Music From The Motion Picture,"I recieved this gift as a Christmas present. The only reaon I wanted it was because of the song ""What The World Needs Now Is Love"" - Jackie DeShannon, which is track #8 on this CD. After I listened to the rest of the songs I was disapointed. I'm just glad I didn't use my own hard earned money to buy it or I would feel ripped off. The few songs that I enjoyed where ""I Say A Little Prayer"" - The Cast Of 'My Best Friend's Wedding' track #12, ""Wishin' And Hopin'"" - Ani DiFranco. track #2, and ""Tell Him"" - The Exciters, track # 4. So i don't really think 13 bucks is worth it for 4 songs. But everyone has different taste in music so I suggest listening to the samples of the songs here at Amazon before you buy it. If you like what you hear then don't hold back!"
4,Great radio and value,"I have used the Talkabout 250's for about 1 year. The 6310 performs just as well, and has many additional features that I find useful. Also, I get about twice the battery life over the 250.The only drawback that I have found over the 250, is that it is not as easy to change channels. Also, the user interface is not very intuitive.However, if you can use the extra features, the 6310 is a great radio."
4,"SONG ""GLORIA"" IN SPANISH LANGUAGE.","This message is for Maria Schlee, Astoria, New York, USA.I'm from Spain and after reading your review I'm glad to inform you that CD ""UMBERTO TOZZI Grandes Exitos"" includes song GLORIA in Spanish language.This CD was released in Spain this year 2001. It's got 14 songs in Spanish and Italian. I like it very much because I understand all the lyrics. I have been listening to Umberto Tozzi songs since I was a child and I still do.Hope this information helps you and, should you still be interested in this song I could send it to you. There're a lot of copies of this CD here in my country."
1,What a hunk of junk!!!,"What a bunch of $&%@ this thing is. I have a high end gaming system (1.2 P4, 512 ram, 64meg video card etc.) so I know it was not my system, but every time I use this program it freezes. This is a fresh install of Win 98se. Nothing else freezes except PictureIT. I have no idea what they were thinking what they designed this program, they make what is the most simplest processes in other imaging programs and turn them in to 12 steps. So bloody frustrating. I almost never buy the cheapest program but I thought to myself ""Well everyone seems to like it, I'll give it a go."", boy was I wrong. Anyone want to buy a used copy of PictureIT?"
1,"Awful, awful, awful software","M$ have outdone themselves this time. The program appears to be written in Flash 5 and runs out of your browser. That should be the first worry, secondly it crashes about every 5 to 10 minutes on a regular basis. In fact, I've never even finished a project on it, and nor do I want to. Good job I won it in a competition, otherwise I'd be straight up to Redmond to demand my money back. The software is written for the 5 to 10 year old intellect, so anyone serious about design, then please stay away. Consider something from Adobe - save your soul.As mentioned before, if you are running Windows 2000 then you are going to have all kind of problems.The software also installs lots of extra things you don't want like a calendar, then attempts to connect over the web to 'update' itself.... Keep that firewall handy.Don't let the 250k icons draw you in, there is nothing there you cannot get off the web for free anyway."
1,Frustrated in Texas,I wish I had read these reviews before I bought Picture It. It would have saved A LOT of frustration. I thought it was just me or my computer. I have had almost every problem mentioned by the other reviewers. I bought it based upon the name Microsoft. Silly me! This program is a piece of junk. Things crash for no reason. Things lock up. It takes forever to do anything. Little documentation or instructions. It is NOT intuitive. My old computer works great without it - I found after I bought a new computer and downloaded it off of the old one. Thank goodness I did not put it on the new one. Try Adobe Elements and forget this thing.
3,Picture it,"A Big Disapointment, the program origionally was a very useful tool but as with all things time and Technology moves on. I would not recomend the purchase of this product."
4,MS Picture It Publish It Platinum is a good program!!!,"I really like this program. I use it primarily for photo editing, but I am also beginning to use its other great features such as card and label making. I do not give it 5 stars as it is not 100% user-friendly. However, I would buy this program over again if I had to make the choice. You can't beat it for the money."
1,Thanks for the advice,Thank you to all who wrote advice on this product. I have been trying to decide on Picture It or Photoshop. After reading all the comments I know for sure I will not be getting Picture It. I was looking for cheapest but I will pay the extra for Photoshop. I guess it's true when they say you get what you pay for.Thanks Again.
3,"Corrupted, and still corrupted but better","I bought this program after getting a digital camera. When i first opened the program, it was pretty helpful. But when i clicked on Web Pages, an illegal operation came up. When I exited, another one came up and i had to restart my computer. The next time i used it, it said it was corrupt. Called Microsoft and they told me to download two files. After resolving the problem (VirusScan was running when i first installed it) i opened it. Everything was good, until i got another illegal operation. So thanks a lot for that Microsoft!At least i can use the program and it has some pretty good features. Next time though, I'll use PhotoImpact or PhotoSuite."
1,Crash and burn Software,"Microsoft Picture It! Publishing Platinum 2002 looks promising, but we probably won't find out as we hardly ever finish anything using it without a crash. I have gone to Micrsoft's own newsgroups, and followed their advice and it still crashes. Belive it or not their stock answer seems to be that the problem lies with your computer, or your software. I don't expect any support from MS on this, they treat it like orphan-ware. Buyer beware, it may work on your system, but MS says it doesn't like HP printers, Norton Antivirus, and sunny days(ha Ha)."
2,Do not waste your money,"I had Picture It 2001 & never had a problem so I thought I would upgrade. What a mistake! It locks up, crashes, will not print my envelopes so on & so forth. I contacted support about the envelope problem & was told that there were issues with some printers. They tried to help but if you do not answer them within a day or two they take you off the list. I don't understand the printer issue, I did not change printers just software, it worked on the 2001 version which I think I will re-install."
2,Don't buy Picture It if you are up-grading to XP!!!,"I bought Picture It and then recieved a discounted offer to up-grade my new PC to Windows XP. There isn't anything Picture It can do that Windows XP does. Most of the picture editting, file transfer, clip art, and web-publishing items are available as part of XP or on the Web for free. I had to go to the Microsoft Picture It upgrade site to make it compatible with my XP and assumed the XP version would have some features not available on XP, it doesnt. Save your money and upgrade to XP, but that is another story as you have to upgrade most of your drivers..."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,"This product does not work. After installing it on an XP Pro system, I found that it is not able to create greeting cards. Instead of displaying the greeting card graphics shown in the thumbnail previews, the actual card fills with large green boxes.I called Microsoft, and the technician indicated that this is a KNOWN problem and there is no fix. ...."
2,Not happy,I dont know if it was my fault or whoever filled the order but I thought I was getting a book and I received a cd set instead. I'll go to the library and get the book to read.
5,Any marriage will benefit from this,"Dr. Phil Getting Real by Dr. Phil McGraw is easy to listen to and filled with excellent advise for becoming a better marriage partner or gaining the confidence to leave an unfixable relationship, and how to tell the difference. Dr. Phil, who is highly qualified in the field of psychology, has the ability to ""get down where you live"" and talk in plain ( an often explitive four letter words) language so that you know you are not listening to some Ph. D. who is way over your heads. His TV and Radio fame is well-deserved, and he provides here no quick and easy exit or fix for an unharmonious marriage, but some excellent advice of how to proceed to make your situation better and to improve yourself first and then your relationships. We highly recommend this set of CD's for time well-used when you are on the go."
3,Its good...sure tis. Not great tho.,"I like this band, I really do. They are interesting but...they sound like the kitchens of distinction to me. A lot. The singer is better here, and the songs sometimes are too. Its a good investment for a cd collection, the singles like into the blue are super. I equate them to KOD in that the good songs are great, the bad ones are really bad. But, what band isnt like that?"
1,microsft greetings,I bought this with the understanding this software did everything and all I can do is cards I dont like it at all what can I do about this. I wanted to do calendars monthly for work schedules and It doesnt work NOT HAPPY WITH THIS AT ALL
1,Microsoft Greetings 2002,I ordered Microsoft Greetings and received Microsoft Greetings 2001 on Christmas. Be very careful ordering from this site. I wanted a new Microsoft Greetings 2002 and received an the old Microsoft Greetings 2001 and paid almost $50 including delivery even though it says starting price $19.95. Have not received an email as to how they plan to correct a very bad mistake and will not get here before Christmas and who will pay for the shipping.
2,Limited Capabilities,"This program has extremely limited capabilities, as other reviewers have noted. Microsoft Picture It Publishing Platinum 2002 is a much better choice."
2,disappointing,"I have been a fatihful user of the Microsoft Greeting Card programs, but with each new edition they do less and are less user friendly. If you just want to make cards....and nothing else. This program will suit you fine. However, if you are interested in creating not just cards, but posters, business cards, wrapping paper, certificates, etc., then check outAmerican Greetings Creatacard program - it has much more to offer for your money."
3,MS Greetings is Good but Lacking...,"If you're a novice with this type of program, better forget Greetings, since the software came with no user guide at all--just a CD in a large, flashy box. In addition, there is no online guide included on the CD. To make matters worse, when I went to prepare an Envelope and tried to find the Envelope feature, I made the mistake of going to the Help function. There is nothing there on preparing envelopes. I wrote Microsoft, and unbelievably, the response was ""don't know if a user guide should have been included..."" and ""The Help wasn't written correctly for Greetings because they used the same Help function that goes with Picture It!"" I stumbled on the Envelope feature by accident when I selected the topic ""Blank."" Microsoft should have done better. If you have time to play with it, the program is easy to use, good graphics and selections, but beware of lousy Help, no user guide, and lousy MS support."
1,A peice of junk,"Sure you can create greeting cards, but what if you want to create business cards, labels, T-shirts, flyers, or stationary? Nada, does not exist, although most other programs have these features standard. This program is junk. I suggest American Greetings Plantinum 5 or 6.. A much better program. Microsoft just does not get it."
2,Not happy with Microsoft Greetings,"I was using the Hallmark Greetings Workshop byMicrosoft but lost the CD-rom. I decided to buythis product and have been so unhappy that I hadto purchase Hallmark Card Studio. MS Greetingsis very difficult to use and has much fewer clip artselections, background choices, and color options.I strongly suggest spending a little extra for theHallmark product."
2,Disappointing,"I wish I could return this product - the choices are very minimal, and even re-sizing objects is unsuccessful because you can see the pixels. There are 13 cards to choose from under the category ""family"". Please!"
2,"predictable, disappointing","After reading the reviews, I was looking forward to reading this book. I was very disappointed. It was predictable and trite. I was singularly unimpressed with the never-ending brawls. I got the feeling he was simply rewriting macho movie action scenes we've all seen ad nauseam. And of course, there had to be the beautiful women in distress that only Devlin could save. I found it interesting this ""moral"" man slept with the other woman character just hours after learning his love interest had been nabbed by the bad guys. But I guess we're supposed to accept that Jack Devlin just can't help himself and the ladies just can't resist him. This book is fine for those who enjoy this genre, I guess. From the reviews, I thought it was going to be a bit more cerebral and thought-provoking. It wasn't."
5,Best Gift gender neutral gift ever! All kids love it!,"I must say this has been a huge hit at our house for the past 4 years. He is now 8 and my son and I have created numerous masterpieces ourselves, and have given these kits to countless kids both girls and boys over the years and have always rcvd resounding Thank You's from the parents and kids after they used it. We always pull one out when it rains and several of the neighbor kids know that and ask to come over when it rains so they can do it as well."
2,Could be Better,While I liked the designs in the book and the vibrant colors of the paints.I was disappionted by the fact that when I tryed tomove my design from the window it tore.If the window is to cold your design can tear.If the window is hot your design will fade.Also I think the drying time 24 hours might be to long a wait for some kids.Also you have to have a real steady hand.
2,Just Okay,"Though I like the designs in the book and the vibrant paint colors.I was very disappionted that when I went to move my design off the window and move it.It tore.If the window is to cold,Your design will tear or crack if you try to move it.Yetin the heat your design will fade.Yet it is a good way to keepthe kids busy .Yet you have to have patients ( as the drying time is 24 hours.Which might be to long for some kids to wait.Also a steady hand is a must have."
5,AMAZING deal!,"I bought this because I loved the style, and it got a good review. WOW, this thing is a STEAL! Goes loud, works great, comes with a smooth remote (only the specktone II, not I), and looks like a piece of art.Adjust the levels on your ipod (really easy, go to settings), and you have a first rate dock."
5,Plan your vacation with Frommer's,"I know this may sound like a commercial, but what can I do? I've become a fan of Frommer's guides. They are predictable in terms of quality: you know you will get a solid and up-to-date guide for your trip planning needs. It is consistent through the years, even as it improves: you know where to look for things. But best of all, it is definitely written with the traveller in mind. Things are arranged in a way that makes searching for information easy. We are planning a trip to North Carolina soon, and I sat down to get ideas and tips for it with the Frommer's guide to the Carolinas & Georgia. I am happy I took the time to check it out. We now have the info we need to make the most of our time there without having to ""eBay"" an arm and a leg."
2,Needs Updating,We were greatly disappointed in this travel guide since the information was out-of-date. We spent a great deal of time locating a highly rated and recommended restaurant only to find that it had closed years ago. Other recommended restaurants also did not meet the expectations according to the review criteria. We tossed the book aside and relied on recommendations of the locals.
2,just okay...,"This travel guide is just okay. It doesn't go into detail at each destination, just an overview. I expected details especially in Atlanta, Charleston, Savannah and Charlotte. I did not find this book helpful."
1,The worst travel guide....,"I have purchased a lot of travel guides and have done a lot of traveling in my life. However, this is one of the most disappointing, poorly written, travel guide I have ever used. First of all, the majority of the book is lodging and dining info, mainly expensive places with little info for the budget traveler. Most of this info could be found via the internet with greater accuracy, depth, variety, etc. That was about 2/3's of the book. For some some of the more important spots like Charleston, Charlotte, Atlanta, and Savannah there was little info about history, what to see and do, etc. And most of the info was old and inaccurate. I was able to get more info, using my iPhone. Take my advice, skip this piece of poop guide and use the internet. You will be much better off in the long run. Another piece of advice, skip Myrtle Beach, SC totally! It is nothing but a bunch of hotels, bad food places, cheap beach items and miniature golf courses."
3,Good....not great.,"If you need lodging and restaurant information in the most of the cities in the coverage area, this is a good guide. It has details on price, location, menu's and more but lacks the originality to take you to the little known local joints that have the best pancakes or killer catfish. Very good for the business traveler and the vacationer that is not interested in straying too far from the obvious choices or experiencing the local culture. If you want to get away from it all.....keep looking"
3,Not Bad,"The usefulness of this travel guide depends on your destination. Travelers to Atlanta, Charleston, or Myrtle Beach will find gobs of information about the target site and area attractions. Going to Augusta as we are and you'll find the helpful information marginal. The authors describe destinations in various degrees of detail and include a few nominal accomodation and restaurant recommendations. They're good starting points at least. I'm disappointed that there is so little help for those traveling with pets as we always do.For pet accomodations I've consulted other books, and the internet.In the back of the book is a fold out map of the Carolinas and Georgia to give the traveler an overall perspective of the entire area at one glance."
3,Trip Planner,The book was ok. It just didn't make clear the massive building of condos and other buildings in places where we thought the coast was clear. Matbe our misread. The outer banks were the pits.
1,Worst Frommers Ever,"What's happened to Frommers? Purchased this guide for a trip into North Carolina from Georgia. Wanted to visit Highlands, a very popular destination for residents of Atlanta. Guess what!! It doesn't even memtion Highlands - just like it doesn't exist. Also, the index is pitiful - by state, but you never know what state you are looking in - there are no page headings. I've been a Frommers fan for years, but I'll be very careful before I purchase another one."
5,Awesome!!!!!,"I really enjoy these hand grips, way better than the spring grips. 30lb was really easy, so maybe just get 40lb or 50lb. But I do use the 30lb like when traveling, and use the others for workout times, or watching TV."
2,wait to review,Great set at first. The 30 and 40lb rings got very soft after about 2 weeks use. The red 50lb ring cracked after about 4 weeks use. They are all nearly useless after about 5 weeks :(.
3,Good - but mis-labeled,"These are good, but there seems to be a lot of confusion about the weights. The product description implies that green = 30lbs ; black = 40lbs ; red = 50lbs. I've read a few reviews that say the black is easiest, followed by green, and then red. Both of these interpretations are different than the product I received. There is no question that the GREEN is the easiest, followed by the RED (medium) and the BLACK is the hardest. I'm not sure if there is a manufacturing issue or just a marketing issue, but clearly people are getting different versions of this product with varying color:difficulty relationships.Aside from the mix-ups, it is a good product and does work well to strengthen your grip. My only two gripes are:- The latex rubber odor is very strong, but seems to be subsiding after a couple of weeks (either that, or I'm just getting used to it)- The rubber texture of the rings is great for grip, but can lead to blisters"
4,"Best I've ever used, also the smelliest I've ever used","Easily the best I've ever used for wrist strengthening: not awkward like springs, and comfortable motion with consistent pressure.Two things make this a bit odd:1) They didn't print the weight on each piece. Using a marker, I took care of it quickly, but could easily see myself forgetting 30 is green, 40 is black, 50 is red. Might suggest that for convenience.2) They smell. I agree with the previous posts. I'm assuming it's the type of rubber or the process used to make the rubber- so far, cleaning agents have not removed the smell, though I hope it subsides.All in all, worth it for a good set of workout devices, and is a good tool for someone training to strengthen for both Martial Arts & Rock Climbing!"
4,STRENGTH TO THE HANDS,"I ignored my hands And arms for decades.Then , I slowly recogniszedthat what I don't use , I lose. So I startedtrying to build my grip strength. And rapidly learned that mostexercise equipment was too much to handle! Instead of quiting in frustration I discovered the GRip Pro TRainer was something I could use to build my strength progrssively. So, once I could use the 30 pound weight, then I could set a goal of moving ahead to the 40weight and so on. I have even played with combining the grips so I can keep growing my strength and flexibilityI no longer fear losing the use of my hands!"
3,"Great idea, but...","I liked the concept of the product. I think the whole idea was great. But I can only give 3 stars for two reasons.First, the smell is terrible. I can only hope that the material is pure natural latex, but there wasn't any mention on what it's made from.Second, the tensions aren't correct. The green one is supposed to be 30 lbs. and the black one 40 lbs., but it felt the other way around. It was way easier to squeeze the black one.I just hope to see some improvements of this originally well-conceived product."
2,Pro Grip Trainer & Latex Odor,"These are great except for one big problem, they have a strong latex odor. I bought the set and all of these have the same issue. They have been out of the bag for over a week and the odor has not decreased. The smell gets on your hands and I noticed it from a few feet away when seated at my desk and the item was on the floor. The scent is not really offensive, but FAR from ok if you're in a professional setting.5/22/08- After almost 2 months the odor has decreased somewhat. The scent still gets on my hands after use but it is no longer quite the issue from afar that it was."
1,Toxic,"Ordered the three pack - arrived quickly. First off - no doubt these will improve hand strength. The problem is the design, execution and safety of the product. Design: Each ring has a seam from the two piece mold that can be annoying when exercising the rings. Execution: For the price of admission, these should be made in the USA vs. China. Safety: By far the most disturbing issue is that these puppies are toxic. There is no doubt your introducing toxins into your system when using these things. Strong scent of chemicals is your reward that will stain your skin for an hour or so after use."
3,Could have done with a remix or two,"""Envious"" is a great song. It's a shame most of the world chose to ignore it. But then again, tons and tons of great songs go unnoticed all the time so this doesn't come as a surprise. Dawn's been around long enough to know exactly how this fickle industry works. And with this single, she delivers the goods. This isn't just another R&B track. It's a track with lots of meaning for the artist herself. It's a great track with tight beats and damn fine vocals to make anyone envious. Dawn's strong vocals aren't too apparent here because this ain't a ballad. The disappointing thing about this CD is the poor tracklisting. Could have done with a remix or two instead of just the acappella and the instrumental version of the song to back it up. Personally, this is a great track, if you like it, buy it because the album is a rather disappointment."
1,Caveat emptor,"There is nothing wrong with this book, but everything with its ""product description"". As you will note when clicking on the Copyright page, this is a reprint of a 1942 book by Glasstone; it is by now two-thirds of a century old. Yet the product description does not state so explicitly, but merely copies the 1942 introduction, which talks about the ""present state of development"" of electrochemistry, and expresses the hope that ""the reader will acquire the modern view in electrochemistry"".That was indeed the object of this book in 1942; the object of reprinting this introductory statement now is clearly to mislead the prospective buyer."
5,Great Product.,"I got this for my girlfriend for her birthday and she loved it. It's much bigger than I thought it would be, at around 2-3 times the size of a normal TY Bear. It's also very soft. Great present."
1,More than a little problematic,"This book was on my son's reading list for 7th grade, so I read through the beginning to see what it was about. While I expected a book about a young man faced with the challenges of his sexuality and his subsequent experiences. I was disappointed to find pages filled with over the top stereotypes and frankly bigoted representations. Instead of handling the subject matter in a respectful way, it paints stereotypes and then assigns values to those stereotypes. One would assume from the book that all male Christians with American flags are homophobic and racist bigots. Of course we have to assume that all gay boys unsure of their sexuality paint their fingernails and hair while parading around in flamboyant costumes. I find the presentation of the subject matter rather troubling for most 12 and 13 year olds. Surely we can do better."
3,DaveH,"""Totally Joe"" by James Howe was recommended by another Shelfarian so I took the bait and read it. I was hoping, based on their review, that it would rank at the top of the coming-of-age YA ""hilarious list"" like ""Swim the Fly,"" ""Beat the Band,"" and ""Carter Finally Gets It,"" did but alas it doesn't meet that standard. Having said that it is really well written and the unique adolescent vernacular is appropriate and right on target and at times funny! The fact that it is devoted to alternative lifestyles makes it all the more relevant in this day in age and its not sophomoric, whiney, or maudlin. This makes it a honest and relevant storyline for the segment of middle-school students who are so often bullied and maligned for their gay lifestyles."
4,A really good Wilkie,I gave this book 4 stars in relation to other Willie books I've read. It addresses marriage in the 1800s and the affects of 'physical activity' on the youth. It is so current in the subjects it explores that I can't believe how much our culture hasn't changed. Moral depravity is timeless and classless.Some great characters again and love Sir Patrick.
5,what more can you say there the best,steely dan is the best band ever and royal scam is a classic do not hesitate to buy this cd ..
5,One of Steely Dan's best...,"The royal Scam has never been a bad album. But, after now 25(?) years, it is better than ever.This is music that grows on you. Forget the lyrics. Listen to how the ""sound"" of the lyrics is an intrument in itself.The Caves of Altamira"" ""sounds"" good and every time you'll listen thropugh it, you will find a new piece of ""sound"", a new instrument hidden in the background somewhere.I only had bits and pieces of this album on CD, and the vinyl version is in storage in Sweden, so it was long overdue to add it finally to the collection."
5,One of my favorites of all time,"I believe that Steely Dan's fifth album ""The Royal Scam"" is an album which shows some of the best ""smart"" rock-and-roll of all time. The songs all contain brilliantly written lyrics, catchy melodies, and harmonies, chords progressions, and forms that boggle some professional musicians to this very today. The album is also worth buying just so that you can hear the killer Larry Carlton solo on ""Kid Charlemagne,"" the albums first (and I believe) best track."
4,Worth Having,"If you are a ""Dan"" fan you will probably get all their older works remastered, if you haven't already. This is done well, but I felt it sounded a bit compressed, it simply did not have that ""live in the room sound"" that the Aja remaster did. Will you be disapponted, no, so go ahead and get it."
4,One of their best.,"This is another Steely Dan album that rocks all the way through. ""The Fez"" isn't one of their best songs, but it fits in well here. Another must own cd for fans."
2,For Guitar Freaks Only,"Of all the old Steely Dan releases, ""The Royal Scam"" is my least favorite. First of all, the lyrics are a tad too morose for my tastes; in other words, Donald Fagen's cynicism ad nauseam. There's also too many guitar effects; on one song, the guitarist uses a voice box, an effect that didn't endear me to ""Framton Comes Alive"" either. Heck, even the horn sections are laden with effects! Stick with Aja."
5,Works fine in my HP2605dn color laser printer,"This was easy and works perfectly. I just plugged it in, and it works. The printer had been giving a ""memory full"" message and couldn't print out certain pages with graphics. This fixed the problem without any new programming or adjustments at all."
3,I like Michael Card,"I like the ""New Jerusalem"" cut on this album the best. Some of the songs I don't care for but it was worth it because of that particular song."
1,"Dont Unveil it, cover it up.............","This is not a typical MC release, except for a few songs, he tried to mix too many styles of music.Sorry, 1 star........."
4,Superb CD of rare and obscure R&B oldies.,This is an excellent compilation of some of the rarest and most neglected R&B and soul oldies recorded during the 1860s and '70s. Most of these songs were originally released only on 45s and are now available on CD for the first time. I recommend this CD to any fan of rare and obscure R&B oldies.
4,EXTREME quality value and service,"I have recently been involved in preparing my A/V for future arrivals of an HD LCD and a Playstation 3. I am a person that research price and specs for months, and the bottom line is that you can't beat Belkin Products, I have used them in every thing from race vehicles to the recent hooking up a new sub woofer. I doubt if find this quality of cable in San Diego for under $40.00 and it would probably be the same product from a parts wholesaler that is open to the public. I would spent money on transportation and sales tax so with the super saver shipping I saved at least $25.00. I have purchased a Belkin Surge Suppressor for all my new gear, and within the next few months will continue to replace what is not Belkin with their products. No one needs Monster cables,but if you are impressed by the image at least they won't hurt your gear, just your wallet"
5,Great subwoofer cable,Great subwoofer cable does everything higher end cables do for half the price. I have a Monster sub cable on another system when I replaced them with this cable I couldn't tell the difference on my test. So again don't fall for over hyped over priced brands!
2,won't stay put,"I had alot of problems with this cable with 2 different subwoofers and 1 receiver. The thing just won't stay put. The connections on both ends are loose and keep jiggling themselves off. This may work well for a low power system with a very small subwoofer, but don't use this on anything large that will put out alot of vibration (it won't stay connected to a 450w 12"" sub)"
3,"cable good, but Polk needs a splitter","This was recommended for my Polk Subwoofer. Nice cable, but it was annoying that it required a splitter.The Polk has 2 RCA plugs.That was not obvious from the Amazon listing. Required a quick trip to a large box store to grab a splitter."
1,Amazon recommended this cable,Amazon recommended this cable for Onkyo CS-445 CD Receiver System and PSW10 Polk subwoofer....wrong cable!! needs to be a single on receiver side and a right and left input on the subwoofer side....This cable is single on both ends....
5,Great Sub cable!,its a quality cable! I have purchased a couple of these for surround sound powered subs with no problems. I have had them a couple of years.
4,makes the connections,wanted a simple way to connect the sub to the A/V reciever and this fit the bill. with this quality cable it sends the signal to the sub without connecting extra speaker wires. it uses the LFE from the A/V reciever for great low end sound. the cable is long enough to move the sub around to find just the right place to get room filling low end responce. Belkin makes top quality products and this one is no exception. would buy this cable at any length.
5,Very Good,It was exactly what I thought it would be. Ordering through Amazon saved me a lot of money.
5,Works great,Don't have a lot to say on this product. It works like it is suppose to. quality is good. I am happy with my purchase
5,Works great!,I bought this so I could move my subwoofer across the room. It appears to be a well constructed cable and had good ends on it that made a very secure connection to the receiver and sub. Highly recommend!
5,Great sunwoofer cable!,I am currently using the cable on the bic america f12 subwoofer. It works great with it too! Great cable overall!
1,I couldn't read it since it was in ITALIAN!,"These Michelin Green Guides are usually great, but this one is in Italian. Since I can't read Italian it was useless."
2,Christmas Cards in July,"The program has a lot of ideas and graphics to choose from. However, if you intend to send out Christmas Cards, start in early July because there are so so many kinks. You lose access to projects that you created. It shuts down in the middle of creation. It slows your entire computer system down. Picture allows me to create the things I like, but it has been a real hassle. I suggest trying something else -- not Printmaster 16 either."
2,"Very disappointed, why did I even bother?","Microsoft Picture It! 2002 is a program I'm ashamed to own. Why MS developed this software so poorly is beyond me. The installation was quick and easy, but once using the software you'll see why many are turned away. There are A LOT of bugs and errors throught the program. It keeps freezing up. The selection of card designs are ridiculous. I do not recommend anyone to purchase this product. If Microsoft wants to develop good photo editing software then they should learn some lessons from Adobe and Ulead."
1,Bad spelled with three Bads,Just will not work on my Windows 98 SE does fine on my laptop that has ME installed. I also purchased Microsoft Greetings V.2002 same problem. These guys at Microsoft are not very good designers.
3,Experience after Two Years of Use,"Have used for two seasons. Loved the system but now the LCD display as gone south. I'm going to have to replace the controller but it appears that I can't buy just the controller--will have to purchase the whole system so will end up with extra valves. I think this should have lasted more than two seasons!I agree that the instructions are a bit confusing but after working with it, it worked out OK. Be sure to use good alkaline batteries. They last a long time. Negative things people said about wishing they could program each setting to run individually on different days can be worked around. You can close the valve on one station and let the others run--just have to remember to open it up again for the next cycle.I will probably purchase the same system again because it works better than any other I've found for the price. Has saved me lots of work dragging hoses. You can set and forget!"
4,Love it but one big drawback,"Love the system. It gives me more freedom so I can travel. I have 6 gardens plus lawns. It works well and very dependable. One drawback is (another person mentioned this) that you can't turn one line off to skip watering a section for one cycle. My huge problem is that we have to have all non-freezing faucets because it gets so cold here in the winter. There is no support for the system unless the faucet comes out of a wall. You can't attach the support for the pipe. I have tried to rig something up but it isn't working very well. Because of this, the weight of the system and hoses sometimes breaks the system at the connection to the faucet. There is a 6 year warranty but can't find anywhere the terms are stated and the store won't replace it. Getting the manufacturer to replace it is impossible so far."
3,"High defective rate. Good warranty (6 years). One's that work, work well.","Bought 3 of these. Some of the timers/valves didn't work out of the box. The one's that did work, worked well and have worked well for years. Called Orbit and had all the defective units replaces. All units have a 6 year warranty."
1,Don't do it,4 way connect difficult to use and the switches that direct the flow never really close so they always leak. Valve can't handle drip pressure and REALLY leak. A complete bust. Still marching ahead on my search for decent in-line valve/timers. No luck yet.
3,Takes Time to Set Up,"Once you get the timer, etc. set it is great, but it takes awhile to get everything set. The instructions are on a big sheet, but the printing is reduced to very small type which made it hard to read. I ended up doubling the size of the instruction sheet on a copy machine, and then I was able to follow the directions. We bought two units, and the second one we could not get to operate during the second season. The problem was apparently some where between the batteries and the unit."
3,disappointment,"I purchased this item because I need to water without thinking. Well, the timer is okay but it not able to set up alternating days or different start times for the different stations. Or if so, I, my husband and my 11 year old son, can not get the ""how to"" from the instructions. I hope the product will live up to the six year warranty, I paid more for a quality product. I have used the off the shelf products from LOWES and Home Depot and they do not last."
4,Good Product,"I have purchase 5 of these. And while they have occasion issues with the valves, mainly due to abuse and freezing, they are still very easy to use, cost effective, and totally portable."
3,Good product but poor customer service from Orbit,"I purchased two from Walmart, first one had a bad valve which won't fully open. I could not find another one at Walmart so contacted Orbit online and tried to get warranty support. No one called after 4 days. Tried calling them, still could not pass through their waiting queue in 20 minutes. Looks like if you get a good working timer and valuves then you are fine. You can water your lawn in different zonez using this inexpensive timer and values. But if you have a bad system either return it to the seller and if you can't then you are pretty much out of luck."
4,"Even with it's flaws,one of the best watering solutions out there","We have 8 Orbit 62032 controllers with 22 circuits working for us every year. We live on a 6 acre property with various drip systems and sprinklers around the property. All in all, we like the versatility of being to diagnose any problem with the unit by swapping circuits and solenoid valves. We have only a few issues with the product; don't leave them out in the rain all winter and a second tip, plug up unused circuits so bugs don't infiltrate the unit. One feature we'd love to see is being able to change the watering frequency for each individual circuit. We change batteries twice a year.Otherwise, great product."
3,Not the same quality as before...,"I bought this system to replace a failing one made by the same people. A handy, efficient alternative to permanently installed Valve and timer system with 4 stations and up to 4 watering times per day. However, don't expect this system to last forever, maybe 2 seasons at the most before valves begin to fail and LDC readout on timer begins to dim making it a real challenge to set. Needs to be protected from the sun in the summer and disassembled and stored before freezing weather sets in. I have 2 gripes about this replacement system... 1. It came with only 2 valves (the previous one came with 3) and the the individual ones are pricey AND... 2. The 4 way spigot that came with this unit is cheap looking and easily half the weight of the heavy duty one that came with the previous one. Makes me wonder where else they cut costs. Only time will tell how this unit compares to the previous one."
4,Sprinker system,Purchased the system so my husband did not have to water a new lawn while I was on vacation - it performed perfectly - will more than likely add another next year. Easy to set up and functioned well.
1,Worthless due to poor design,"This would be a great timer EXCEPT that all four outlets have to run on the same cycle. You can set the length of time that each outlet stays open, but if you want one outlet to run every day (to water potted plants), then ALL outlets have to run every day. That means that lawns and flower gardens, which should only be watered once or twice a week, get overwatered or get just a light watering every day, neither of which is good.I'm taking mine back."
5,Works fine,"Been about a month now and no problems from this device. Works just fine. Only annoyance is in manual (water now) mode, you can water either one station or all of them, there is no option for subsets.In programmed mode you can water any set of the four per ""time"". You get three of these ""times"", independent of each other, per 24 hour day.Waters stations in a given ""time"" in series, not in parallel, so only one valve is open at a time. This is a Good Thing for us, but it doesn't seem to be changable if you want different behavior."
2,Save your cash,"Both me and my ex girlfriend bought one of these kits for our lawns. (We live in the Northeast) Both control units crapped out in one season, so this spring I have to purchase some other means of a timer for the lawn.(Yes we tried fresh batteries)Although four channels are available on the timer, the kit only comes with two valves and mine did not want to operate separately even though you can control the valves separately via channel(1-4) and time?? -Apparently not simultaneously but in succession.The controller (timer) is not all that user friendly and may confuse a typical baby boomer with minimal electronics exposure.I would not purchase this kit a second time."
1,"Leaks, leaks, and more leaks","This did not work for me at all. I didn't find it difficult to program, but one of the valves in the four-way splitter had a slow drip, and both of the valves never completely shut off. In fact, I couldn't get them to shut off at all with the ball valves in the four-way splitter all the way open. Once I turned the water down enough for the shut-off to work, they dripped like crazy.I believe my water pressure is high, but I don't experience problems with anything else hooked into it.I'm taking this right back to the hardware store and will search for something else. Consider getting something a bit more solidly put together. I know I am."
3,Needs improvement,"This product works, but needs some funtional redesign to make it more usable. You can set how long each station stays on indidually, but all stations are turned on for every watering cycle. That is not how most people use this type of product. It would be much better to be able to set which stations come on for each cycle and the duration for each station that is turned on. If you can live with turning on all stations on every cycle, then this is a great product. Doesn't work for me though. Wish I could get my money back, bud I didn't discover this design deficiency until I had already installed and used the product."
2,Be sure to check plants after a year.,This worked well for two years but valves quit working with no warning other than dried out plants. The valves must be treated as short term throwaways. It may not be worth risking your plants to this.
3,Orbit watering system,"I have have two of these systems for the past 4 1/2 years. They are great for drip systems, however as stated before the stations cannot be programed differently. Only the watering times can be altered.The major problem is the deterioration of the plastic attaching the female hose bib to the valve. It does not last and is very sensitive to pressure upon attaching it to a faucet. I have had to replace 5 of them to date as the plastic simply falls apart."
5,Using these for years! Love it!,"For the costs, reliability, and ease of installation, these are great timers. They have up to 3 cycles and you can use up to 4 stations. It did takes a while to learn how to program. But once you caught on, it was great. I have been using these for years now. They are in a covered location. One timer (the oldest), I had to remove the rubber buttons and now I use something pointy to hit the buttons. But, the parts are high quality and they take a beating out here in Phoenix."
4,Great product,"Pros----Comes with two station timers and can be expanded to four. The digital timer and all the accessary (including the battery) is great as you can open the product and use it right away. No need to run to Home Depot for the missing items. There are 4 stations and three timing cycles for any watering day pattern.Cons----I can't figure out how to tie one station to one cycle only. Right now it runs all the watering cycles on the all stations each day or days pattern . Probably that is a limitation. For example I have set cycle A between 4 am to 4.30, Cycle B 5 am to 5.30 and Cycle C is 6 am to 6.30 and I have two hose stations active to run every 3rd day for 15 minutes. It runs all three cycles A followed by B and then C on both those two hose stations every 3rd day.Overall very happy with the product."
3,"Love the system, but hate the durability","This system is so handy, super easy to set up. It's not very user friendly, but eventually I got the hang of it. The only negative comment I have is that the valves break often. They do honor the 6 yr warranty and will send new valves (nice customer service), but out of the 8 valves I've purchased, I've had to replace each of those valves twice (after two seasons of use). Now I'm on my 3rd season using them. The system itself is still working great, but 7 of the valves leak and will have to be replaced for a third time. I still am glad I purchased it, and would recommend it if you don't mind the hassle of replacing the valves once or twice a season. Overall, you get what you pay for."
1,"Good idea, doesn't work well","Installation was very easy with the included manifold and the valves fit perfectly onto the manifold itself. I ended up buying two systems.However, the valves open only unreliably so keeping a seed bed damp in a new lawn is impossible. Offhand, five of eight valves open reliably, three of eight open only one time in three.The timespan between a valve closing and another (or the same one) opening is around 90 seconds. When the valve does not open, the reset time is similar. This equals a lot of time waiting for a valve that won't open.I've also had trouble with the displays blanking out if they get damp (not wet, just damp). This requires resetting the entire system and reprogramming time, day, and schedules.All in all, this system disappoints for its price."
2,Undurable,It is a nice system and easy to put together. It is not quite durable valve to last. It sometimes stopped working or leaks the water after it shuts off by the timer. The timer is much more durable but the programing is hard to follows and is confusing in the most of the schedule. Hopes it help you with your watering. I would suggest the permanent water valves and set it up with the plug in timer instead.
5,love this for drip and soaker system,newer versions are integrated. This separate solenoid system is better and Orbit should bring it back as a product for low pressure drip systems. manifold is great at customizing pressure by zone without having to use a pressure reducer.
1,Worked for about a month...,The level of functionality is a bit more than I needed but I purchased this timer because I liked the all-in-one packaging. Setting up the timer was a bit more complex than it should have been but the device did a fine job for a few weeks. Then the LCD screen started to lose some digits and became very difficult to read and control. Batteries were being used like crazy (3 AA's every two weeks) and some of the modes are now useless. Going to the trash...
1,BAD DESIGN + BAD QUALITY = BIG HASSLE,"Should have played safe and gone by the negative reviews of this product. But the concept of having one timer control 2 valves with the possibility of expanding to 4 valves appealed to me. Unfortunately one of the valves leaked and was defective. Also, the threaded hose connectors on the brass manifold come off too easily when removing a valve or a hose. The whole thing leaked badly. The DIG timer (model 9001D) is way much better in both design and quality. I installed two DIG timers on a plastic manifold from my local hardware store with no leaks whatsoever on the first try. And the DIG is much easier to program and use."
3,Needs work to be acceptable,"The 4 way manifold included reduces the water flow to about a 1/4"" opening. One of my sprinklers I thought was broken and would not even run properly. The other sprinkler had much less distance then before. Before returning it I decided to not use the manifold and sure enough everything was back to normal. Now I bought a better 2 way splitter that does not restrict the water flow. 2 outlets is really all I need since this set up only includes 2 valves. Should have been better out of the box. Programming is not as bad as some describe although it's not simple as with some other timers."
4,This product is great!,"This product is great. You can certainly schedule any one station to turn on or all to turn on. You can also use the 4 separate schedules to stager the watering for different areas. The daily scheduling is available to every day or skip any day during the week or use the built in scheduling to water every other day, or every third day. Another nice feature is the delay option, with a fast selection you can delay watering up to 24 hours which is convenient if it is raining on that day. With some finessing you can achieve most of the scheduling you need. My one complaint is that when scheduling a sequence of watering on anyone of the four schedules the next station will start right after the other if they are both on the same schedule cycle(1,2,3,4). I was able to find the additional valves at several garden nurseries in my area or from a number of retailers online.This is by far my favorite timing solution."
1,Terribly complicated program for limited versatility,"While the valve system seems not to limit the flow as much as some other water timers, nowhere on the package nor in the instructions does it tell you that in only works by running each of the 4 stations sequentially! I had to call the place I bought it from to learn this. The only thing you can set independently for each station is the on time duration; in all cases, it has to run first station 1, then station 2, then station 3, then station 4; No independent start times for each station.Think you're gonna turn on one station manually? It's gonna take you a ridiculous number of button pushes for EACH of the following:1) find your way into manual on mode2) select the station3) set the on time (at least you can set it from 1 - 99 minutes)Not to Orbit - PLEASE FIRE YOUR PROGRAMMER! He must be an office temp with a bad attitude.Note to Home Depot- STOP selling this junk. You do your customers nor your reputation no favors"
1,overpriced and poorly constructed,"I have had three of these Orbit timers. They were the ""best"" I could find at the local hardware. All have failed within a few weeks. I bought two at ACE; took one back immediately because it leaked; got a replacement. After a few weeks both the replacement and the other original purchase just quit working. A third one worked for about a year but I had to replace the batteries every couple months. I will not by Orbit again."
2,"Poor Design, poor quality","We purchased a unit last year to water our back yard (due to severe watering restrictions which made us water between 12am and 4am). Bought two extra units to have four watering lines. Not overly difficult to set up, and get to run accurately. But, and it is a big but, it will break within (or less than) one year. All four of the valves consistently leak due to the pressure of the hose being on (wasting a ton of water). They just do not hold up, and are not worth the money. Bought another unit this spring, within one week, unit now leaks. Bottom line, don't buy..."
3,A word from a family member...,"I found this on Amazon quite by accident, doing the family name search thing; Joseph and Ruth Ragona were my parents (I'm the youngest of their four children). While the article is informative it also doesn't begin to cover the magnitude of pain, frustration and grief my family went through; the irony of it all is just days after the court issued the order to allow my mother's feeding tube to be removed, she died of an infection resulting from bed sores--Christmas Day, no less, a week from when the tube was to be removed.Why am I posting this review? Just to add a bit of perspective to the article from someone who lived through it."
5,it gone be a another HIT.,"dear all, this album will be another great work by these artists.cant wait to get the cd,good luck"
1,Nostalgia?,"Their first album, 1001 nights, was may be the best these two musicians could offer. Later as Spanish or flamingo music became popular, many other artists entered the scene who did a much better job. In their latest album, Shahin & Sepehr try to bring some Persian flavor to their music but with no success. The title Norouz (which is the Persian new year) ends up being the same old Spanish flamingo and the rest of the titles fail to justify the name of Nostalgia, because they have nothing to do with the Persian music. In their last title on this album they try hard to bring Persian melodies in, an again they fail.The question is, while making this album, were Shahin & Sepehr nostalgic about Persia or Spain? I wish I could give you an answer.Bottom line, if you are looking for Persian music, try Axiom of Choice and if you are looking for Spanish kind of music, look elsewhere."
3,Who is She?,"Matt Cuneen's mother rents a room to a beautiful young woman, but the woman remains asleep in DREAM OF FAIR WOMAN even after she is removed to the hospital. Three people come forward to identify her after a story of the sleeping beauty appears in the local paper. The problem is that she is identified as three different people.A good story becomes mired in too many murders and red-herrings that mislead the reader and Matt.DREAM OF A FAIR WOMAN is only recommended in a pinch when you're out of any thing else to read. This is how I found it.Nash Black, author of QUALIFYING LAPS."
4,TalkAbout T6300,"This two-way radio is a very good asset if you are taking trips or going to amusement parks. The Weather feature is a great addition and is very useful with its weather alerts. However, the batteries wear out fast, it doesn't have a two mile range like Motorola says, and there was no need for the eighth weather channel since NOAA doesn't operate on that channel."
2,Pretty pointless...,"This book was not that great. It is pretty frivolous in my opinion. I read it for English class and was able to analyze it well. However, the plot is dumb and disappointing."
1,Dolphins? What dolphins?,"A better title for this disk would've been ""crappy synthetic sounding music with the occasional sound of an ocean wave or seagull"" Or maybe ""False advertising at its best"". My main gripe with this album is that there are hardly ANY dolphin sounds on it! The very few sounds that I do hear only last a second or two, and they sound very distant and quiet. It's especially ironic that the track titled ""Dolphin's Theme"" doesn't have a single sound from a dolphin in it.I'm sure some people will like this for the music aspect, and maybe even for the ocean sounds as well... and that's fine, but do not buy this if you think you're getting dolphin sounds, because you aren't. Terribly misleading title and album cover."
5,One of the most beautiful stories ever written,"This book contains Saul Bellow's translation of 'Gimpel the Fool'. This is the translation and the story which made Singer famous in America. It is a masterwork.Singer is for me the greatest of all storywriters. I feel a special love for the Jewish world of characters he so wonderfully creates. The title- story 'Gimpel' is the story of a baker's assistant, an innocent slow- minded person of faith who though he is endlessly used and exploited by others continues to have trust and faith. He is deceived into marriage, and deceived repeatedly by his wife, knocked on the head everywhere, and yet his innocence, his trust do not abandon him. His holy love has a beauty about it which deeply moves to sympathy , to laughter and to tears.Reading this story will I believe make most readers feel more deeply human , and make them sense more strongly the paradoxical beauty and greatness of life."
2,A nice system but...,"A nice system, very elegant design and performance...no complaints there. A bit costly and the HD DVD Drive has seemingly buggy audio playback with HD Disks. For the price, as with most electronic devices, you expect some baked-in price for the customer service that comes with the package. On this piece; you are throwing a fair percentage of that unit cost out the window. Have called TOSHIBA Customer Support 3 times on a single issue. System will not recognize the TV Tuner that is part of overall unit. Not a buy-up but; sold as 'part of the package'. I was transferred to ""Level 2"" support 3 times, waited on hold for 20 minutes 3 times and was promised a ""call-back"" within 4 hours. That has taken place over five days since I received the computer one week back. To date; nothing, no call back, no email. The last time I called, I mentioned that I was ready to return the system on a poor Customer Service basis alone. Same result; no call back. It is a bit disheartening."
1,Qosmio has manufacturing defects,"I purchased a Qosmio G15R. It was manufactured with a defective motherboard, which was replaced by Toshiba. The same problems resurfaced after the warranty expired. Toshiba told me too bad. I'll never buy any Toshiba product again, especially considering how rude the technical service people were."
1,"Toshiba Qosmio G45-AV680 17"" Notebook PC",I had a Toshiba Satellite Notebook and experienced great warranty service. This time I decided to buy one of the top of the line notebook from Toshiba. But the notebook went in to problem little more than a month after I got it. I sent it to repair shop and I was notified it was the main board problem. They ordered new main boards twice still can not fix the problem. I wounder if this is only an isolated problem or Toshiba computer is not reliable at all.
3,A bit graphic and too much for a person that it not a sex offender.,This book would be great for a person dealing with some heavy issues of sexual addiction. Not recommended for the faint of heart or teenagers. Intense.
4,Wothwhile reading.,"The only shortcoming this novel has is its predictability. And at that, it still delivers a surprise in the end. The only reason I even say it is predictable is with all the evidence pointing to the lovely, if not pure, lady the reader has to know she will be proven innocent....or where is the mystery? McBain succeeds in pulling off a couple of surprises and the characters are developed enough to be interesting, if not always believable.This novel is no longer in print but if you can find a copy of it somewhere, as long as the price is reasonable, it is worth the investment. It is a fast, fun read with enough twists and turns to keep you on your toes."
4,DOing well..,"Where can you find the song ""Don't you forget about me - Sprung Monkey"" It's a Simple Minds cover..The best song in the movie..WHen that strange teacher leaves the ugly guys in that classroom, that's when you hear it the first time..It is the last song too, after ""mest - i melt with you"".. They play it in the aftertext!"
3,My Review: 'Not Another Teen Movie' soundtrack,"At first, when I saw this album, I was enthusiastic. I mean, I enjoyed a similar soundtrack (remember ""Scary Movie""?) After, I saw all the remakes on this album, and I became less enthusiastic, but still willing to give it a chance. Specifically, I like what Marilyn Manson does for already written songs. He does well with stuff like that. I personally didn't care for *this* remake, though. I'm not going to blab on about the other songs that I didn't like. I'll tell you about the one's I *did* like. I liked Orgy's ""Blue Monday"", Scott Weiland's ""But Not Tonight"", Saliva's ""Message of Love"", Goldfinger's ""99 Red Balloons"", and sort of liked Good Charlotte's ""If You Leave"" and Phantom Planet's ""Somebody's Baby"". Now, I remind you, I'm not a big fan of remakes, so, by now, that should be taken into context. I won't tell you to go buy the album or not, that's up to you, just, take my opinion into consideration when you think about buying this album."
1,kiss me,"okay, to whoever was asking about the song where the girl is going down the stairs, that's sixpence none the richer doing ""kiss me."" i haven't even seen the movie and i know that. have you never been subjected to commercial radio or what?"
4,i luv Good Charlotte and Mest,"This is a great soundtrack! i really like it because it features 2 of my Fav. bands (good charlotte, mest), and the movie rocks, Good Charlotte is the band that plays @ the prom,"
2,Where are the really good songs??,"I have personally counted every song used in Not Another Teen Movie in the credits, and there were 42 songs throughout the entire movie. Answer this for me: WHY ARE THERE ONLY TWELVE SONGS??????!!!!!!?!?!! About two of these songs are ALRIGHT, but it makes me mad that they didn't use some of the better songs, like the remix of "" Don't You Forget About Me "" and the song "" Prom Tonight "". Don't buy this CD unless you like being disappointed."
2,songs,"The song where priscilla is walking in with her girlfriends is from Imperial Teen-Yoo Hoo, and I do agree, they should've put it in the soundtrack, but what can ya do."
2,"Two good songs, could live without the rest","Manson's cover of ""Tainted Love"" and Orgy's cover of ""Blue Monday"" are just great and as a DJ I see both songs pack the dance floor week after week after week!I don't care for the rest of the CD at all, if your a industrial type DJ I would recommend owning the cd for the two listed songs above, however as a music fan I would be hard pressed to recommend this CD."
2,"Not bad, though only one of these songs I heard in the movie","Yes, that is right, only one song (Bizarre Love Triangle) was actually used in the movie, from start to end. Where's 'Turning Japanese', or 'Don't you forget about me?'"
2,poor buy,"I only bought this cd cause i was told that the musical number was on it. i was extremely upset that it was not.l The only good thing to buy this CD for is Marylin Manson's cover of ""Tainted love."""
1,Not Another Scarry CD,None of the songs I heard in the movie were on the CD. It relly bites. I DO OT RECOMMEND IT.
3,what is that song ?,"yo know the song when they play football...and we hear 'hit me baby, hit me all night' do you know what is the name of that song and who sing it ! plz..."
4,Muse's Smiths Cover,"Muse's cover of ""Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want"" by the Smiths is worth buying the entire cd. Marilyn Manson's version of ""Tainted Love"" kicks ass also. Rock on."
2,Not another cover soundtrack,"Its simply a collection of sub-par covers. I perfer the original recordings of all of these songs. The only outstanding track is Scott Weiland's ""But Not Tonight."" It has a catchy but haunting intro that will be stuck in your mind for weeks. This CD is symbolic of hollywood in general: it lacks fresh ideas and thus redoes classic movies, Tv shows, etc with dismal results."
1,Copy Protection???,"I saw the review above that mentioned the copy protection made it not work on their computer, however I am having the same trouble with my car stereo. My home system plays it just fine, and my car stereo plays every other CD I own fine, but this one chokes it completely. I get a clunk clunk clunk then a read error. I appreciate the need to protect their intellectual property, but this is a load of BS. I suggest borrowing a copy of this CD from a friend and testing it before buying it to make sure you can play it. Its not like I am talking about an ancient CD player either, I bought it brand new no more than 3 years back.As for the content (on the systems that will even play it), not bad overall, the Manson version of Tainted love is the best song on the album."
2,Sub-par.,"To answer cheesemeister02's question about the road trip song-it's ""Let's Go"" by the Cars, another obvious overlook by the people who put this soundtrack together."
3,it's just OK,"liked the songs in the movie, the soundtrack is okay but I only liked a few of the songs in the remake of the originals."
5,Best Clint Eastwood Western,Absolutely the best western done by Clint Eastwood. The next best one if not a tie is Outlaw Josey Wales.
4,Good,"Clint's acting is great, the plot is ok though a little slow in parts. There is nothin' like a good piece of hickory...."
3,Shane revisited,"The DVD transfer for this film is not very good. It's grainy and lacking in the detail quality one normally associates with modern DVD releases.The storyline is straight out of George Stevens' masterpiece, ""Shane"", filmed 2 decades before with Alan Ladd and Jean Arthur. While ""Pale Rider"" has a little more realism thanks to location shooting, that's as close as it gets to the original. We never see the conflict within the protagonist (Eastwood) that made ""Shane"" so good. The rest of the cast seems to struggle somewhat with their roles and I have stuggled to give this film and the DVD transfer more than 3 stars. Just buy ""Shane"" instead.Recommended for: Eastwood fans and, perhaps, western movie fans."
4,Pale Rider,"Excellent Clint Eastwood western, precedes Unforgiven, I use excerpts from it in my classroom when we study the wild west and mining"
3,"Not the best, but still pretty good","Although most reviewers site this film as a remake of SHANE, Eastwood is really returning to the storyline of his own 1972 film HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER, but minus that film's brutality and, unfortunately, its single-mindedness. PALE RIDER has a difficult time finding its center: is it Eastwood's ""Preacher"" or Michael Moriarty's settler? Although the weakest of the quartet of Westerns Clint directed, it's still entertaining and beautifully shot, and the sequence where seven assassins gun a miner down in the street is memorable."
3,so so,"Clint should've stuck with the Dirty Harry series at this point in his career. This movie and it's premise was nothing special. Worth a watching, but I'd advise against buying it even for $6."
3,Pale rider,"Great film , image as *** and sound *** (included castilian spanish) 22 days send to Spain"
3,Shane its not,"Clint Eastwood needs to be credited for making 2 very important Westerns, especially the first, in The Outlaw Josey Wales and The Unforgiven. Though famous for the spaghetti westerns, filmed in Spain, made by the likes of Dino Delorentis, when Clint turned his own eye to the genre he chose to not only be serious, but to remind us that life in that era was far from glamerous. With that in mind, he took a crack at remaking Shane. Sure, there are some significant differents. Still, the stranger rescuing innocents is right out Shane. I still found this story to be a little TOO cookie cutter. When I first saw Shane, I really wasn't sure our hero was going to win the big duel. In this case, there was no doubt. I recommend this film with the proviso that you don't expect too much."
5,A Good Historical Western Movie With One Sgnificant Flaw!!!,Just for once I would like to see a movie with Clint Eastwood in it where all of the women don't fall at his feet in love with him. In this movie he plays a preacher who befriends a gold miner. Then the gold miner's daughter wants to marry him and then Clint has sex with his new best friend's wife!!! With friends like this who needs enemies? I give this movie 5 stars because the scenery alone is breathtaking and it is a pretty good historical drama apart from Cint's bedroom antics.
2,A storyline too close to 'Shane',"I found this movie to be way too close to 'Shane'. It was badly directed by Eastwood and his acting was not much better either. I don't usually mind Eastwood but this is a shocking example of his work. If you are a Clint Eastwood fan it is worth watching but otherwise, don't bother."
5,Pale Rider DVD,"This is a pretty good western movie. Not one I watch all that often, but fun to watch once in a while. The acting is a bit cheesy, but I had to give it 5 stars because I love Clint Easteood's movies."
2,A Disappointment,"As a big Clint Eastwood fan and a HUGE fan of High Plains Drifter and The Outlaw Josey Wales, I remember going to the theater in 1985 with high hopes for Pale Rider. And I was HORRIBLY disappointed.More than anything else it seemed like a flimsy rip-off of High Plains Drifter. It was almost as if High Plains Drifter was such a good movie that they decided to make it again with different characters. You never really found out who the ""preacher"" was, or why he was there (aside from putting a bunch of bullet holes in the bad guys). The violence seemed random. I didn't even like the ridiculous hat he wore throughout the whole movie."
2,No Alan Ladd,"This is of course a rip-off of ""Shane,"" but with the plot modified so Clint can beat up and shoot more people. Otherwise, it follows the classic original right down to ending with a youngster standing on the edge of town shouting ""I love you"" as the hero rides off (but not wounded as Ladd's character was). One parallel does not work, though. In the 1950 version, we can understand why the Jean Arthur character will be attracted to the clean-shaven, quiet-spoken, peace-preferring Shane. But why would the Carrie Snodgrass character and her nubile daughter played by Sydney Penny possibly be drawn to the scruffy, menacing Preacher, who too obviously relishes the destruction of other human beings?"
4,Pale Rider,"Although Pale Rider is one of my favourite Clint Eastwood movies, I have to admit that it could have been much better. As in The Outlaw Josey Wales and High Plains Drifter, for example, we have a protagonist who is haunted by a past injustice, an injustice which he strives to rectify through the barrell of a gun. Unfortunately, in Pale Rider, the score between Stockburn and Preacher is much too vague, and so instead of adding to mystery, the viewer is left somewhat baffled. Over all, though, the movie is still very good, and definitely entertaining."
3,"""High Plains Drifter Meets Shane""","Clint Eastwood's ""Pale Rider"" (1985) is an entertaining yet derivative Western that represents the flip side of the actor-director's ""High Plains Drifter"" - a far-superior effort. Though Eastwood delivers a fine performance as the mysterious Preacher, with good support from Michael Moriarty and Carrie Snodgress, the overall film lacks the dramatic resonance of ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"" and ""Unforgiven."" Instead, ""Pale Rider"" tries to evoke the classic tradition of George Stevens' ""Shane"" and partially succeeds. The film has some good action sequences, but drags a bit in the midsection. Still, a flawed Eastwood Western is better than none."
1,Rating the transfer NOT the film,If you do not mind your DVDs looking like good VHS and your blu-rays looking like average DVDs then purchase Warner Bros. releases and you'll be pleased.The DVD release of Pale Rider is about as bad as they come..even for WB.Really looks bad.Terrible grain throughout.Contrast(black level) off THROUGHOUT...Either looks very washed out or too dark to see..I'm not exaggerating. It isnt uncommon for many WB blu-rays to look sub par..But their DVDs usually are watchable. IT'S PRESSED ON A SINGLE LAYER DVD..THAT SHOULD TELL YOU SOMETHING.The movie was good but I went blind after viewing for a few days due to the terrible transfer.

4,A Good Eastwood Western,"It is pretty difficult to go wrong with a Clint Eastwood Western (especially post Sandra Locke) and Pale Rider is no exception. The only reason that I only give this four stars, is that I tend to watch Unforgiven and The Outlaw Jose Wales more often. A good addition to the Clint Eastwood video library."
5,Coolest Clint Eastwood Ever.,"Not very original (Clint got some ideas from previous westerns) but probably the coolest Clint Eastwood western of all time. Although ""Unforgiven"" was more realistic and ""The Outlaw Josie Wales"" had a better story, this one is cooler. The ""Preacher"" was also a better character than ""The Stranger"" from ""High Plains Drifter."" They should definitely put this one on HD DVD or Blu-ray."
3,A decent western for the Eastwood fan!,"There is no doubt that this film clones some of Shane, but it also has a unique story to tell. Typical of many westerns, especially Eastwood vehicles, you have this stranger that arrives ""out of the blue"" to protect the abused. If you enjoy westerns, like Clint Eastwood, & don't mind some violence, then this is not a bad flick. Just try & put ""Shane"" out of your mind & enjoy it for what it is--escapist fare, lacking in any serious socialogical or psychological statement."
5,Clint Eastwoods Best Western,"Even ""The Unforgiven"" couldn't hold up to this timeless epic of an un-named stranger who went by The Preacher saving Tin Panners in the West from the Tyranny of a Coal Baron. Great Flick and one of my personal favorites"
4,Old movie on blu-ray,"This movie has pretty good quality, a lot better than having this on video. However it still isn't as good of quality as a normal blu-ray movie, but this movie was made in 1985."
3,Eastwood's weakest Western as a director,"Another remake of Shane. Clint Eastwood tries to use the supernatural angle from High Plains Drifter to far lesser success. Clint is a butt-kicking preacher inexplicably defending a small mining community from an evil corporation. The film has a great visual feel, but its predictability proves too tough to overcome. Watchable, but ultimately, the weakest of the four Eastwood-directed westerns."
4,Entertaining but flawed,"The main character is typical Clint Eastwood - strong, stoic, independent. The plot has just enough complexity to be entertaining without too much confusion, and the characters have reasonable depth. The only troubling scene is a rape scene in the beginning. The audience is supposed to accept that she ""really wanted it"" - a dangerous message, I think."
4,Eastwood Makes Entertaining Films,"This was a solid western, one of many through the years from Clint Eastwood, who knows how to make an entertaining film.""Pale Rider"" is almost like a modern-day ""Shane,"" in which the quiet stranger enters to help the picked-on landowners and then winds up with a showdown with the evil men in town. In this film, Eastwood plays a ""preacher,"" (that's all he's called in this movie, but he's really a gunfighter) who saves the day for the town miners, led by Michael Moriarty.There are a lot of mixed moral messages in this film. A couple of things, however, for sure: 1 - the interesting characters; 2 - the convincing bad guys; 3 - the beautiful scenery and photography; 4 - the involving story that makes you care what happens. All of these make this an entertaining film you would watch a number of times."
5,Entertaining,I've been a fan of Clint Eastwood's Westerns for such a long time. I saw this movie only very recently and enjoyed it. Don't miss it!!!
5,Good Viewing,"I have always been a Clint Eastwood fan. I think the movie itself is great but the quality of picture is terrific on Blu Ray. I have seen the movie before, but I wanted a copy of my own. For everyone that has a BluRay player and likes Clint Eastwood, this would be a good purchase.After seeing the movie for about 3 times it dawned on me that Pale Rider was basically a remake of Shane starring Alan Ladd from the year 1953. Only the setting was changed, but the story was the same."
4,East,"As is typical with Eastwood's magic, this is a very good story about a man being called to something greater than self and, at the right time, stepping up. At bear minimum a good afternoon watch."
5,Close Case by Alafair Burke,"I started with Ms. Burke's first books and enjoyed it so much, I read the whole Kincaid series. I love here style of writing. Keeps me turning page after page."
4,Alafair Burke,Alafair Burke's later book shows much more maturity than her first book. She is coming close to the excitement and emotion that her father's books cause in the reader. I am becoming attached to Samantha Kincaid and hope that Alafair continues writing about her.
2,A book that goes nowhere,Too much of the same old same old in this entry in the Samantha Kincaid books. Female DA opposing her significant other male policeman with the to be expected result. Out of respect for the earlier offerings in this series I will give her next effort a try....hopefully it will prove to be more fulfilling than this one.
1,Kindle edition marred byTypos typos typos,"I suppose the book is good. I'm about to give up as there are so many scanning errors cropping up that one must stop and decipher before reading onward.How much would it cost to ask someone to proof-read what is obviously scanned copy? To correct simple but annoying jumbles?Miss Alafair, you should complain to your publisher for vandalizing your product.How silly to not do a good job at such a simple task. Shame."
2,close case not,"i purchased and read this book simply to find out if james lee burke's talent extended to his daughter. as far as i am concerned it did not. i found the book tedious , boring and a hard read. where james lee burke's characters are colorful and extremely interesting ms. burke's are flat and tiresome. so disappointing. perhaps her writing will please others. certainly wish her the best."
3,Close Case came fairly close to rating a 4 star...,"I picked this book up in a hospital gift shop when I was desperate to have something to read, and the selections there were very limited. It's not the type of book I normally read. Luckily, I found the book to be enjoyable. I liked the protagonist, who was drawn with characteristics mimicking a real person. She was interesting, cranky, loving, suspicious, etc. The mystery was well drawn. What keeps this book from receiving a four star rating is that many of these characters were introduced in other books, and I felt I was missing important back stories that were repeatedly alluded to by the author. You might want to start with Judgment Calls and Missing Justice, the previous books by Alafair Burke."
2,slowly going downhill.,"I'm not a huge fan of Christian music--I find most of it grossly derivative and formulaic. But I loved switchfoot's first album, ""The Legend of Chin."" It was raw and full of energy, and the songs were very well-crafted and original. The second and third albums were ok, but not nearly as good as that one. But I didn't like ""The Beautiful Letdown"" at all. On my first listening, I found myself wincing as I heard the lyrics. So trite, so contrived. What happened? Some of the songs are alright, but about half of the album reminds me of why I stay away from contemporary christian music. John Foreman said that the songs on the first album were songs he wrote in his dorm for himself--they weren't necessarily meant to be consumed by the masses. That might explain the gradual watering-down of their music, as each of Switchfoot's subsequent albums have been made to appeal to an ever-expanding audience. I guess it's just hard to be original and creative and keep a record deal."
2,"""meant to live"" is deceiving","if you think switchfoot's ""beautiful letdown"" will follow in the wake of ""meant to live"", think again.""dare you to move"" sums up the whole cd, mellow and bland.sure,they are a christian band and have inspiring lyrics which could ""move"" people.but this allbum is pretty boring.i mean seriosuly guys, take a listen and try not to fall asleep.""meant to live"" is a good song, but other than that-zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz."
2,Porn Music?,I heard meant to live and thought that it sounded good so I bought the cd and was dissipointed. Most of the cd just sounds like porn music or something. I just didnt get it. There is only one or two other songs on this album that are pretty good though.Not worth the Money.
2,Swtichfoot - The Beautiful Letdown,"Oh Boy... Well all I can say about this one is that the only good song on the album is meant to live, which is the only reason I gave it to stars. A little to pop for me and there are no good songs. Come on people all they did was make a good song and fill the rest of the space with crap.A little to christian for me as well (keep that stuff out of rock) and thats why so many people are dedicated to this album.If your not a god freak, your not gonna like it."
5,Very Strong LP,"I purchased this album after hearing and enjoying ""Meant To Live"" and was not disappointed by the rest of the album at all. Every song is good, although there are definitely some standouts. Of course, one of these is the first single ""Meant To Live"" with its rock vibe and catcchy chorus and the same thing can be said about the second single ""Dare You To Move."" Other strong, single-worthy songs include ""More Than Fine"" and the title track. However, my favorite is the ballad ""On Fire"" which is rather lyrically bland, but a pretty darn rock bqllad anyways. ""Adding to the Noise"" is also a strong track.Highly recommended album! It's a pretty decent cure to the other horrible hip hop dominated music right now. It's cool to see poitivity-driven music getting attention. Kudos to Switchfoot!"
5,"I hate organized religion and I love switchfoot, go figure","Just in case anyone is non-christian or dislikes churches or doesn't even believe there is a god, I'd still say buy this album, cause I'm in the same boat and it's really good. It isn't trying to convert anyone or preach to you it's just really good usually positive uplifting songs, and when every other song out there is either about sex or killing yourself or how sad or angry you are, this is some refreshing wonderful stuff. I dare say it's given me a better outlook on life even. It just makes you happier to be alive and realize how things aren't so bad, so check it out.And the singer has a great voice, the band's rockin, the songs all sound different from each other... it's a really good find."
5,Switchfoot's The Beautiful Letdown,"Jon Foreman is one of those songwriters that has that rare ability to absolutely captivate; it's refreshing to hear music that HAS SUBSTANCE, but isn't the least bit preachy. The enitire thing is simply riveting, with high-energy songs like ""gone"" (<my personal favorite) and ""ammunition,"" and ""meant to live,"" but also slower songs that are also extremely beautiful, like ""twenty-four"" and ""more than fine."" I especially enjoyed the bass parts, especially on the title track, ""The beautiful Letdown."" This album has the youthful rawness that that has been characterictic of the band since their first album, Legend of Chin, yet it's obvious that they've grown and evolved; FIVE STARS, people! this album truly is amazing."
5,The Best Ever..,"I've been a switchfoot fan for a long time, and they're the best band I've ever known. Their music is very inspirational, especially this CD. It has beautiful songs like ""On Fire"" or ""24"", with both beautiful messages. It also starts with a great opening using a very powerful song called ""Meant to Live"". It also has a great remake of a song that's been in previous CD's and in the 'Walk to Remember' Soundtrack called ""Dare You to Move"" The other songs are also great, so overall this CD was the best I've heard in a while. I almost guarantee you'd love the music on this!"
5,Amazing CD,"I just got Switchfoot's new The Beautiful Let down CD and it is great, the music is awesome and the message is there and creates one amazing new alblum!"
5,Excellent Song writing and Lyrics make this cd GREAT!,"One again Switchfoot has done it. The lyrics on this album are powerful and moving. The title track especially hit me when Jon basically stops singing to say what needs to be said. "" the church of the drop outs, the losers, the sinners, the failures, and the fools""...""let us sing one true tune"". And the songwriting is amaizing like in ""Meant to Live"" and ""This is Your Life"" Switchfoot really rocks while still conveying a powerful message about purpose in our lives."
5,Ultimate Pleasure to my ears!!!,I have really come to love Switchfoot ever since I first heard Learning to Breathe. This cd just made me like them even more. Switchfoot rules and it seems that switchfoot will continue to rule my top ten cd's list. ANYONE who likes top 40 type music should get this cd. I love it and I garuntee that u will too.
3,"Its a pop CD, Not Rock","I borrowed this CD from library recently. I brought it home, put it in the radio, and instantly jammed to the wonderful hit Meant to Live. Terrific song. But I was sad to find out, it was only rock song on the album. For some reason, I thought this band was a rock band, not a pop band. That was a dissapointment.THE MAJOR PROBLEM WITH THIS CD.Meant to live, This is your life, and Dare you to move are terrific songs, but the rest are just tasteless fillers. This lyrics are good, but the music too dull and, for me, boring. More than fine's chorus sounds to much like their latest single Stars, only worse. All in all, this CD has three good songs, maybe four, (I'm okay with Gone.), but that's all. The seven other songs are slow and blaaaah!But this is just me. I'm more of a headbanger. If your a Christian rock lover, put this CD down and pick up Momentum by Tobymac or Skillet's Collide and Alien Youth.If your a pop/soft rock lover, you'll most likely love this CD."
4,Solid soulful rock and roll but...,"be careful buying the DVD version. The video for Dare you to Move(a great song with a great message) is the original video. The one you may have seen on VH1 or MTV is ""version 2"". IMO version 2 is the better video. So if you like the music you have heard on the radio you will like the entire album. But the video in the enhanced version is likely different than the one you've seen."
5,Big Fan from Canada!,"There is too much to say about this group! I saw them live in Ottawa a couple of nights ago, and they are great! It's awesome to finally see a group that can actually play their instruments and sing. And wow can they sing! So after the show I bought their CD. They are so awesome!! ""Dare you to move"" is my favorite track. To all the fans, or new comers to this group, I suggest you to get this album, it's their best yet. And if they are in your city, go see them and have the time of your life."
5,I had to buy it,"YES, there's a band that can make such a great music, it's called: ""SWITCHFOOT"", excelent, perfect, great, awesome, jewel, masterpiece, etc, etc, etc."
5,This CD's awesome!,"This is an awesome CD!! If you get a chance, go see them live. These guys rock! Keep it coming Switchfoot."
5,A great cd for anyone,"I found this cd to be an great one. If you buy it im sure you'll agree. Best of all its a great CHRISTIAN cd. Each song has a great meaning behind it. Meant To Live is soo good it is played on MTV, FUSE, and secular rock radio stations. With this cd you can keep the great sound of rock and lose the bad lyrics. This is a great cd for anyone!!!!"
3,"okay, but it's no legend","when i first heard switchfoot's the legend of chin cd, i hated them. i actually saw them in concert at a small cafe type place which would have been way cool had i not disliked them at the time. then i listened to a new way to be human and i met the sound of switchfoot anew. i love 'em and was so excited to hear their songs in a walk to remember. unfortunately, i was less than excited with the cd learning to breathe and still more disenchanted with the beautiful letdown. switchfoot's recent cd's sound very similar and lack the uniqueness of the first two cd's. don't get me wrong, switchfoot is switchfoot so the beautiful letdown is still okay. my advice: listen to their cd's from newest to oldest and then the music will only get better."
2,The Name says it all,"The beautiful letdown.. yes. yes it is. I love switchfoot. these guys are great christian guys,. and have a great sound,. but i have noticed that each of their cds gets worse. Every cd gets more overproduced,. and harder to tell apart from other bands. Most of the songs on this cd sound the same, and one question.. why did they put ""dare you to move"" on this cd,. when it was on ""learning to breathe""? that confuses me,. but oh well. It has some good songs, especially 24, ammunition, and of course, meant to live.PS. I think its sad when people trash someone's review just because they dont agree with it."
5,Great CD Offensive Review,"...they are a Chirstain band and they should be talking aboutGod.""Contemporary Christian music has come a long way toward secular acceptance in recent years thanks to the likes of Switchfoot, who avoid obvious sacred references in their lyrics. It's also refreshing to hear CCM songwriters like Switchfoot's Jonathan Foreman explore love and belonging as song subjects. Unfortunately, The Beautiful Letdown hews too closely to the formula established by alternative CCM brethren Jars of Clay and Creed."""
4,WOW,"I first heard one of the songs 'Dare You To Move' on the show One Tree Hill and I loved it so much I had to investigate!! And look what I found, this album is amazing so get it NOW."
3,3-1/2 stars -- Nice solid rock,"This latest album from Switchfoot, The Beautiful Letdown, is one of those albums that new fans may love, but old fans may hate. I personally think it's a pretty solid album.There are a lot of good songs to choose from, like ""Meant to Live"", ""Dare You to Move"", and ""Redemption"". But there are also some iffy songs, too. ""Adding to the Noise"" starts off fine, but then comes the chorus: ""If we're adding to the noise/Turn off this song"". It'll pretty much make you follow those instructions. And ""Gone"" goes a little too far with the similes when they start to say things like: ""Gone like Frank Sinatra/Like Elvis and his mom."" But overall, The Beautiful Letdown is above-average, and one of the better rock albums that came out last year.Anthony Rupert"
3,It's ok...,"When this cd came out, I couldn't wait to get it. Then I got it, and it's only ok. I have all the Switchfoot cd's and I was expecting something spectacular (that's what they would need to top Learning to Breath). Anyway, Meant to Live and Gone are the best songs on the cd. Switchfoot is still the best band ever, this is just their worst cd."
1,Yuk,Your telling me about a beautiful letdown are you people deaf can't you hear that half the time the singer sounds off. I would rather hear myself fart.
2,Mostly a 2.5,"I do not know what people see in this band...and honestly, what do they think is Christian about this music...If God heard this, he would turn it off way before the first song got done! This musical effort, although there is something called effort in this, is one of the worst musical CD's that I have heard in a long time...so why the 2 rating? Well, there are some good songs on this record, but the low rating is because I feel that this group has seriously misrepresented itself. This is not Christian by any means...in my opinion."
1,stupid,"This album is KINDA creative at best with only 3 good songs. I am not a fan of this music and I only wasted my money for Meant To Live A song I dont even like anymoreI wont even get into the band's watered down ""Christian"" message. To much comprimise for me."
1,my ears hurt,for u listeners THIS ALBLUM SUCKS 1 star i give it ya meant to live is good but the album sucks there not even a real rock band anohter wnnabe THEY ARE HORRIBLE THE ALBUM IS HORRIBLE DONT WASTE UR MONEY U WILL FEEL BAD IF U LISTEN TO IT I FEEL SORRY FOR THEM THE ALBUM SUCKS
5,The best so far,"I've been a fan of Switchfoot's for a few years now, and I have heard just about everything they've released- and even some they haven't! This new CD is absolutely amazing and has opened doors to a new kind of fan. There are more upbeat songs than ever before and Jon's lyrics are incredibly as always. Switchfoot still rocks my socks!!"
5,Wow!,"I love this CD! I don't even know what it looks like becuase I took it straight out of the case, put it in my CD player and never took it out! It is amazing. I can relate to the music so well. Some of the things they sing about seem like the same things I think and say. Switchfoot is definately one of my new favorite bands! I love they way the sing Christian music and still make it sound cool."
5,Awesome,"This is an awesome cd. After I bought it, I bought the 3-pack of their older releases and it was good as well. If you like christian-rock or just plain rock than this is a great cd and this won't ""let you down"""
5,Makes you Wish there was more!!!!,"This music is awesome, it holds up to the style of Third Eye blind and some of the early incubus. This is awesome listening too. I thought I wouldnt find any good music like this anymore, boy I was wrong, all that good soft alternative rock(unwritten law, coldplay). This is just a another great band that will go down with the other classic alternative rock groups"
5,Great Album!!!,One of the greatest albums of all times! Switchfoot rocks the music world!!! Seriously if you listen to christian rock or alternative rock or music... YOU NEED to buy.
3,3 1/2 stars. .,"I know this may sound wierd considering this cd is hardly a year old, but many of Switchfoot's big songs bring back a lot of memories for me.The summer of 2003 was pherhaps the greatest summer (possibly YEAR for that matter) of my life, and these songs that were popular at that time bring back a lot of good memories. We lived next door to my two best friends, and every day us and my brother would go out and play baseball. Or we would explore the 40+ acres we lived on. Ahh, what a year!Anyways, the cd starts off with 'Meant to Live', which was not just popular among Christian music, but even in secular. It's a good, catchy good with a good message.Other good songs are 'More Than Fine', 'Ammunition', 'Dare You to Move' and 'Gone'. 'Gone' was in the top-ten charts for I don't know how many weeks! And now 'Dare You to Move' is growing even more popular.Switchfoot is definately a group with talen, promise, and a future."
5,Hardly a Letdown,"This CD is phenomenal, from start to finish. Its thought-provoking lyrics are coupled with great music, from the catchy ""More Than Fine"" to the haunting ""Twenty-Four"" to the driving ""Meant to Live."" The CD's front and back cover and liner photos are even unpretentious but fabulous -- they're a great representation of the straightforward, real-rock-and-roll tunes contained on the disc. Even cynical atheists like me will find the soulful music on this Christian rock group's first mainstream album to hold up, listen after listen. A must for any contemporary music collection, The Beautiful Letdown is uplifting and compelling."
4,Disappointment(but just a little),"The reason I didn't really like this cd was because it wasn't under a christian lable.(Columbia) If they are christian people, why can't they be a christian band? Besides that fact, this cd is awesome. The songs speak to me."
1,"Oh No, not again","Meant To Live- Everyone's heard it. Most people love it. I'm one of them. And to know they were Christian and yet still produced something like that- i knew i had to have this CD.But unfortunately, the old adage that a Christian band can't produce good music consistently is true. Meant to Live is the only good song on here. The rest of the album consists of sappy, cliched bubble-gum pop. And SLOW, sappy, cliched bubble-gum pop. The music, the lyrics, they all suck. Not even fit for radio. Even Meant To Live gets old. I payed $8 for this album, before it went platinum and blah blah blah. So i wasn't ripped off as bad as some. And yet, $8 for one good song that i don't listen to anymore? A complete waste of time and money. Any true music fan, stay away from this album. You'll die of boredom if you try to listen to it all the way through. Maybe your grandparents will like it though."
1,A Letdown Indeed,"I can't wrap my mind around why this CD has been getting such good reviews! Personally, I bought it because the song Meant to Live is awesome and, silly me, I thought the rest of it would be as well. Instead- it was a letdown and believe me when I say there was nothing beautiful about it! I couldn't listen to more than thirty seconds of each song without skipping to the next because I couldn't stand it! All the good qualities from Meant to Live were severly lacking on the rest of the album. Songs like Dare You to Move just made me want to throw up with the whiny, over reaching vocals. Hopefully this will teach me a lesson about the 'buy the CD because the single is good but it turns out to be a bunch a crap' syndrome that so many of us suffer from. If you decide to buy it anyway- at least you were warned."
1,The title says it all,"There is only one good song on this album in my opinion. That one song is Ment to Live and it's already played out. Something told me that this album wasn't going to be worth it so I donwloaded it and deleted every single file just after listening. The songs are horrible. Everyone who likes them I guess are intitled to there own opinion but I don't see the good in this album. Like one of the guys said in another review on here rock is supposed to be controversial and this is the opposit of that. A good album I think any of you should check out is Smile Empty Soul's self titled album and listen to ""This is War"" <-great song."
5,Great Music with Great Lyrics,"What I love about groups like Switchfoot, Audio Adrenaline, and Jars of Clay, is that they all have a GREAT sound to them, very enjoyable, but also have wonderful lyrics. A secular group may have good music, but think about the words your listening to. Whether you like it or not, the music you listen to affects you. The Beautiful Letdown had great music, and the guys voices are GREAT. The Lyrics always are very grounded in good Biblical truths. A wonderful CD for the music lover!~ProvGirl~"
5,Switchfoot ( Only the best band ever!),"Well first off I would like to say, that if you haven't listend to Switchfoot's new CD get started because you don't know what you're missin' out on guys, they play great music ,they can rock out and have a good time and also send a positive message through all of their songs( I mean every single song on the album)and I am pretty sure that everyone who owns the album can most certainly agree with me!? They are great role models for teenagers or anybody of any age. To me , I ,personally, think that they will never be a "" One Hit Wonder"", they'll be out for many years to come. And they have great ""thinking"" music. They are something to listen too, I'll tell ya'll that much!"
5,EXCELLENT!!!!!! Tell all your friends about Switchfoot!,"Excellent album! Many other artists' albums I have bought only have one or two good songs, but Beautiful Letdown is EXCELLENT! Every single song has a deeper meanings and great music, great singing. I can't believe Switchfoot isn't already a household name. I hope that they will get the recognition they deserve. My favorite songs from the album: Meant to Live, This is Your Life, Dare You to Move, Redemption."
4,Huge improvement from 'Learning to Breath',"I felt that their previous album was a little to ""pop"" for my taste. But this CD really blew me away! ""Meant to Live"" is probably my favorite track on the CD. If you enjoy Lifehouse, I'd definately recommend this!"
5,Awesome,"Hey guys, this cd is too awesome for words, i bought it a while ago, and now i can't live without listening to it EVERYDAY! it is soooo awesome and you NEED to buy it!"
4,Very listenable music,"I am not a big fan of Christian Rock music. I do not consider myself to be a Christian, and many Christian bands seem to be all about church propaganda with really obvious biblical references. Switchfoot also makes these references, but they are much more subtle and non-offensive to those that do not always agree with church thinking. The music is very listenable. It sort of reminds me of a mix of Third Eye Blind and Jack Johnson. I actually pefered the music that was not played on the radio over the music that got lots of airtime.Overall, it was a very decent cd."
5,Switchfoot.........amazing...absoloutely amazing.,"I'm only 14 so ppl expect me to like stuff like Rihanna, but i've always liked stuff like Incubus, Creed and Mandy Moore.after i watched A Walk to Remember, which was also my favorite book, i got the Switchfoot flu. i listened to them day and night.So far i think Dare you to move is the most amazing song on the planet. My favorite part of that song was ""Between who you are and who you could be, Between how it is and how it should be, I dare you to move"". Those lyrics just have so much meaning to them. If you like Dare you to move and Redemption, Try listening to the song Learning to Breathe from one of the previous albums. All in all, Switchfoot is the most amazing band on earth and they deserve more. They rock.....:-)"
5,emotion,"These lyrics actually have a meaning, not just a bunch of words scrambled together. Catchy beats with one of the better vocalists around make Switchfoot the great band they are. they are a christian band but many of my none christian friends love them too cause they not really gospely or praisy. There like any other band but they don't swear in their songs. Best tracks: Meant to Live, On fire, Dare you to Move, Adding to the Noise"
5,The Beautiful Letdown is the Best,Switchfoot has really done something great here. This cd is great. I love all of the other Switchfoot cd's and listen to this all the time. The only time I am sad is at the end because I wish there was more.
5,Switchfoot is off on the right foot,"After doing the sound track for ""A Walk to Remember"" what could Switchfoot do to keep the fans interested? The Beautiful Letdown is by far not a letdown. If you are a switchfoot fan this is a must own! The songs are filled with passion and energy and I can promise you that this cd will never leave your player. Give it a try because I promise you will love it!"
5,switchfoot is amazing,"Switchfoot has pulled it off again. When I first bought the Learning to Breathe cd I knew this group was amazing. It was no suprise to me that they became popular outside the christian music spectrum. There songs touch your heart and make you want to be a better person. Whether you are sad happy, upset or stressed Switchfoot is always great to listen to. Their newest cd isn't as great as Learning to Breathe but Switchfoot is one of those groups whom the more you listen to them the more you love their music. This cd is still one of the best cds I have ever bought. It amazing and I am hooked on it especially the first two songs."
2,i see God...,"...because ive died from boredom.i borrowed this cd from my boss. im glad i didnt buy it on the strength of ""meant to live"", which i love.folks, this cd is boring. the first and last songs, ""meant to live"" and ""24"", respectively, are enjoyable, but every song in between is dull.there is little originality and the lyrics dont grab me. the vocalist has a nice voice, but from song to song, there is no variation, no energy, nothing different in his delivery."
1,What a disappointment,"I stopped listening to the radio years ago, and this CD is a perfect example as to why: because the singles are always good, but the albums they come off usually suck. I was in a friend's car and the single, ""Meant to Live"" came on. I loved it and downloaded it when I got home. Today I went to Target and saw the CD on sale for $15 and picked it up. It sucks. I was expecting to hear something like the single, which I think sounds like Hum, and instead I got the Christian Goo Goo Dolls. It's freaking acoustic/electronic pop! ""Meant to Live"" is an awesome song, but it doesn't represent this album well at all--in fact it's very misleading. None of the other songs on here have that same sound at all. This is the reason people download music right here. Because bands like Switchfoot release awesome singles then put a bunch of filler on the rest of the album. Out of my 900+ CD's, this would be in my top 3 most disappointing purchses."
1,Indeed a Letdown,"I also bought this based on the 1st song. The rest of the CD is NOTHING like it, and it totally lacks any inspiration or originality."
1,Great Song....Bad CD,"I bought this cd because of the first song...I saw it on MTV this morning and thought that the rest of the cd might be at least somewhat similar to the first song. I guess I was horribly wrong. The rest of the cd, aside from track #1, is like a mix of bad club beats mixed with acoustics. Very bad songs afterwards.Now dont get me wrong, the first song was tremendous. Best song I ever heard, it's all I play in my car now. Phenomenal it was. But alas, I was wanting more of what was displayed in the first song. If it was the band who wrote that song, then they should have written the whole cd themselves. But if it was someone else who wrote that song, then they should have had that guy do their cd for them.This cd to me was made for a one hit wonder type deal. I mean, I really cant see any other song off that album getting on MTV like ""Meant to Live"" did. All in all dont buy the cd, just burn the first song on the album."
2,"Not worth the purchase, but worth the ITunes tracks","There's too much electronic effects in this CD. The best songs on the track are simply Meant to Live (which gets radio play on big name stations), Dare You to Move, and On Fire.The rest of the tracks seem to ""mainstream Christian"" in its attempt to be different by adding an electronic sound to it.If switchfoot stuck with the classic acoustic drums and ditched the cacaphony of electronic effects, the CD would be a winner.Buy the good songs for less than a dollar @ itunes.com or something."
2,I don't get it!,"Why would any band come out and draw attention to the fact that they are Christian rock? It is the worst marketing strategy possible. As soon as most people hear ""Christian"" they instanly think ""This is gonna be lame."" If I wanted to be preached at, I would go to church. I am sure these guys are a big hit at those horrible Christian rock concerts that are only attended by kids whose parents won't let them buy good music.Anyhow, this CD isn't totally lame. But it isn't anything groundbreaking or original either. Actually there are 3-4 good songs and the rest is pretty boring. ..."
5,Best CD you'll own,"This CD is great. I first borrowed it from a friend, and loved it. I think I stayed up till midnight listening to it. Soon I went out and bought it myself, and listened to it all the time. Like all CD's, you get tired of them, but about once a week or so, I'll feel like listening to it, and it'll be just like the first time I heard it. Really really good. You definitly have to get this CD, it's a must-have, and you won't regret getting it. It's also a great gift."
4,Good,"Switchfoot is a VERY good band and ""The Beautiful Letdown"" is a good album. This said, let me suggest you get ""New Way to be Human"" or ""Learning to Breathe"" because these are actually their best CDs."
4,Awesomely Perfect,"This is a great CD. Every song is catchy, melodic and rocks hard. Jon Foreman's voice is earnest, and pure . He can sing, OK? This is one CD you can play from start to finish and not be disappointed. Go buy it!"
4,Deep and Meaningful,"I had first heard ""Meant to Live"" on a music video website and I was completely blown away. Not only did it have a rythmic, melodic beat that compelled me to blow the capacity on my speakers, but the lyrics were so wonderful and really made me think. It was only until after I had actually purchased the CD that I realized that it was a Christian Contemporary. Nothing about this album is pushy or preachy, it's just plain rock infused with great sounds and good messages for anyone who actually has a brain and questions this life. I'm way impressed and hope to see another album blow away my new speakers."
5,"Weird at first, but totally awesome.","I had anticipated this CD for a long time and when I finally popped it in I was a little disappointed. Not because it was bad, but just because it was different. I was stuck on the ""old Switchfoot"" (which is still amazing by the way) and the Beautiful Letdown is anything but ""old Switchfoot."" They have reinvented there sound in a glorious and refreshing way. With passionate rock tracks like ""Meant to Live"" and ""Ammunition"" and touching softer songs like ""On Fire"" and ""Twenty-Four"" you can't go wrong. Of course you can't forget the tracks that can only be described by saying they sound like, well, Switchfoot; ""This Is Your Life"", for example, is my favorite on the CD. I love the entire thing and I would recommend it for pretty much anyone. It is a definite must for any Switchfoot fan."
5,"Depth, Understanding, and a transcendence of all ""lines""","... a band like Switchfoot proves that talent and musical-mastery transcend any and all boxes you may like to place them in. If the secular music industry would play bands like Switchfoot with the same audacity as they plug Eminem as he ignores any and all lines existant in common moral codes, their would be more than a handful of ""Christian"" (labeled) musicians gracing our airwaves.On ""The Beautiful Letdown"", Switchfoot has managed to capture all of the wonder of their previous releases -- including lyrics that surround biblical concepts and themes ... but has additionally improved upon their musical content, honing it to the point of double-edged precision. This CD - if given a listen with open ears - will refresh you, challenge you, and leave you longing for so much more!!"
5,This is my favorite cd!!!!,When i bought switchfoots cd i only knew the songs Gone and Meant to Live. This is the first time i have ever bought a cd and honestly LOVED everyone of the songs on it. Im so excited its such a great cd! I recommend it to everyone!
5,NOT A LETDOWN-GET IT NOW,"This is a must have for all Switchfoot fans and all fans of rock music. Don't miss out! Don't let the whole ""Christian rock"" backstory to this band get in the way either. Switchfoot has broken through the barriers with ""The Beautiful Letdown"" and soared to a whole new experience. Their unique sound is a must have in these days where everything seems to sound the same. Grab your friends and rock out to Switchfoot."
4,Just....wow,"I first heard Swithfoot on the soundtrack for 'A Walk To Remember' and instantly fell in love with them. Jonathan has a simply fantastic and completely unique voice, and the fact that he writes his own songs makes it all the much better.I didn't find out until much later that Switchfoot was a Christian group, which would normally turn me off of someone, but I just could't drop them. So take it from an agnostic who usually hates Christian music with a passion, this is a worth while album to buy. It's almost always in my cd player."
3,OK,"After hearing 'Meant to live' and 'Dare you to move' on the radio I was really excited to get the album. But after listening to the whole thing I was a little dissapointed. Most of the songs are decent but I wasn't blown away by this album. Although I have to say I was pretty surprised by 'On Fire', which I think is one of the best songs on the album.A lot of this CD's songs sound the same to me, its not a terrible album but not what I was hoping for."
5,Amazingly Beautiful,"This CD is even better then the first Beautiful Letdown release. It contains a little bit more, plus the songs sound clearer. The bonus DVD is the best part. Clips of live concerts and backstage action. Switchfoot definitely knows how to give their fans what they want, and this is it! Way to go guys!"
5,Check the CD out,This CD Beautiful Letdown by Switchfoot is defiantly amazing. If you ever have listend to switchfoot previous albums it is low key and mellow but this album has more guitar playing hard rocking melodies and it also has those low key mellow songs this cd has a little bit of everything for everyone I recomend it to anyone
3,I expected a lot more...,"Switchfoot is a great band, I won't deny that. However, this CD just didn't live up to my expectations. While I will admit that there are a few really great tracks on the album; there are also some lousy tracks that seem to be ""filler tracks."" Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to bash the band - I just think that they could do better - and I hope that they will...soon."
5,Yes!,Good successful Christian music. Very good voice and guitars. Drums are ok. But deffinately get this album. Praise The LORD.
4,this is how it is,"You most likely have heard of them because of:Meant to liveInteresting point: meaningful christian lyricsBest song played loud:meant to liveBest slow song:on fireBest Lyrics:goneMy favourite:gone/dare u to moveDont like: im not really christian so some lyrics dont appeal to me. ironically, beautiful letdown is the big letdown.Also good by this band: sorry dont kno any of there other stuffIf you like this look out for:umm tough 1 maybe try maroon 5. sorry il try think of something better"
3,Not as good as most are saying.,"Rhythm: 7/10Vocals: 8.5/10Lyrics: 4.5/10Song-by-song originality: 6/10Overall: 6.5/10Worth buying: YesThe album kicks off with a good song with lots of rhythm, Meant to Live, the current single. After that, however, the album dives downward, not in musical aspect by any means. The vocals remain very well sung, and the music is played with just as much taste as the first track, however the lyrics become generally unpolished and dry. Switchfoot sings about things that we can figure out by watching TV or reading a book, not things that we want to have to listen to over and over. They also sing about things that are mostly uninteresting and/or unappealing. If the lyrics were all given a Page 1 Rewrite, the album would be much better. However, because this does not happen, the album gets more and more annoying each time you listen to it. But despite it's flaws, the album does give some good listening."
3,"No Bad, Really","Made the mistake of buying the entire albulm instead of my two favorites; 'Meant to Live' and 'I Dare You to Move'. I love thoes songs. The rest of them felt underdeveloped to me. The lyrics could have been a lot better for the topics discussed. But if you can get past the lyric truble on the other songs (which i usually can't)the unique melodies created will carry you on. I also loved the lead singers' voice, which is what kept me listening till the end. (usually does, i'm a sucker for the soft voices that are't over the top and/or seriosly strained; well not always)."
5,Unacknowledged Masterpiece,"I don't know why this album takes short shrift. Back when this material was on vinyl and in two different installments, Volume 2 was one of the very first jazz albums I ever purchased, and Ive never looked back. After God knows how many thousands of dollars of investing(haha) in this addiction, this remains one of my all time favorites. The contribution of Eric Dolphy is unmistakable in the arrangements, and Trane is both full-throatedly passionate and sensitive throughout. My favorite is ""Song of the Underground Railway,"" but the rest is uniformly searching, coherent, and excellent."
4,is punk rock still alive?,"A buddy of my from california sent me a copy of Icebird's album (magnitude) and i have to say its pretty damn good. just imagine if Mark Arm was driving a van with Mission of Burma and the Wipers and they crashed head on with a van filled with Sonic Youth and Soulside, pulled from the wreckage would be Icebird. Magnitude is a solid punk album."
1,"Shop Around, Be Creative","You can go to your local hardware store and purchase high grade stainless steel ADA hand rails for your marine application ranging from 12"" to 48"" rated at a load of 500lbs. Several styles, and configurations. 12"" price starts at about $14.00. Think creatively!! Marine products are just a product advertised for ""marine"" use."
3,"Publisher good, photo editior bad",Publisher 2002 is a pretty good product. I haven't had any of the prolems that some other people have had it runs great on my machine never crashed. It has some really good templates from menus to flyers to paper airplanes. and it is pretty simple to use once to get a little used to it.The photo editior on the other hand does basically nothing. You can find a much more robust photo editior on-line for free! I would suggest saving the few bucks and getting publisher only. The bundle discount is not even worth the money.
5,I love this movie!,I was thrilled to find this movie and it is very good quality. It was also a fair priced dvd. It came in a timely manner to my door and I was impressed!
2,Fair at best,Would not recommend it. Does not perform as well as expected or as well as friends lower priced HP printer.
1,Too many problems,"After reading all of the reviews, I decided on the S800 to go along with my new 3.3 MPixel digital camera. Now 2 S800s later, I'm giving up. Both of the brand new, out of the box, S800s had the same problem. They had thin streaks across the photo. It didn't matter what kind of paper, what type of printing (text or photo), or how many ""deap cleanings"" I did, the streaks were there. Tech support was very helpful, but couldn't solve the problem. The 1/8 inch between the streaks looks great, but it's a little tough to call that a photo. I guess I'll try the Epson next."
1,A Bad Overpriced Printer,"One star is too high a rating for the Canon S800. This is a bad, overpriced, overrated product... After reading the effusive reviews, I opted to go with the Canon S800 rather than another HP. I have to assume that the people who rated this machine so highly have never used an HP. It is slower, less quality, more cantankerous and more expensive than my old HP -- and that one is three years old. There are only two areas where it lives up to advertising: the separate color cartridges and the rear paper feed for card stock. Even there, the rear paper feed is manual, one page at a time... Before you buy, test run other printers. If you do, I doubt that you will buy the S800..."
1,Not worth it,"I went photo printer shopping and tried out the HP's. I was not overly impressed at first, but once I saw a print on high resolution paper, I was pretty much sold. Then two of the store employees told me that the Canon S800 would impress me, as it's prints could blow any HP, Epson or Lexmark print out of the water. The only problem was, their S800 wasn't set up to print samples. I went to another store, and their S800 couldn't do samples either.I researched it online and saw many rave reviews, which said that you couldn't tell the difference between a normal photo and one printed on the S800. Combining that with the individual ink tanks, I figured I couldn't go wrong. I got the printer yesterday, and have tried many prints on it on a variety of papers. I have yet to be impressed, I am highly disappointed though. I will be returning the S800 and purchasing an HP or Epson."
5,So far so good!,"I just set up my new S800 today and so far it's working great. The photo quality is fantastic! I printed a high-res image onto one of the glossy 4x6 sample sheets they include and you really can't tell it's not a genuine photo. Setup was nice and easy - I had no problems with the drivers or instructions. Now I just need to buy more paper and I'll be good to go. Thank you to all the helpful reviews on here - they're why I bought the product and why (I hope!) I'll continue to be happy with it as others are, too."
4,Still working after all these years,A colour printing workhorse. Easy setup and easy to use colour printer from a world leader in colour inkjet printing.
5,Another winner for Davis,"Burke Davis has hit homeruns with other Civil War books on the fall of Richmond and the flight of Jefferson Davis, on Sherman's March, and a good bio of J.E.B. Stuart. This one follows the Confederate defenders of Petersburg and Richmond til the surrender at Appomattox. This book uses tons of first person accounts based on letters, diaries, newspaper articles, and memoirs. Davis writes in a crisp, readable style that will keep you turning the pages. Much has been written about Lee's surrender at Appomattox and this is surely one of the best books on the subject from a Confederate point of view."
1,Beware,"I got this book and began to look through it. And I noticed that the book was missing about seven pages, the info about ranger feats and new weapons, some of the best stuff. Also several of the pages in the book are in the wrong order. I emailed mongoose about this and they never got back to me. So beware buying this book, you might not even get it all."
4,"Worthwhile addition to an aviation buff""s library",Over the years I have read many books about the Battle of Britain and of those I consider this the best. It is extremely well written and describes how the challenges were met even though the pilots were so fatigued. Some bits of humour (Come and meet 145 squadron.Nice chaps-all two of them )throughout it.Brief mention of three American pilots who later left to join the Eagle Squadron.One of them(Shorty Keogh) was so small(4ft 10in) he had to use two air cushions and his parachute pack to see through the windscreen of his Spitfire.
5,Toyota Corolla 2001 S,"Better that expected!!Smooth Grip, low noise, Last longer that stock on enthusiast usage!! = )Excellent Price/performance ratio!!WILL BUY IT AGAIN!!!Highly Recommended to Any Toyota Corolla Owner!!You Will not Regrets!!"
5,A must-have if you're a cheesecake lover!,Anyone who loves cheesecake will love this book. The cheesecakes never fail (and never crack). Recipes are easy to follow and ingredients are easy to fine. There's a cheesecake to please everyone!
5,Appropriately Named,"I have make several of the recipes in this book and they ALL have turned out fabulous. Some of my friends even offered me money for the cakes. As far as the reveiwers that mentioned the liquors, I couldn't disagree more. Yes there are some that use liquor, but, not all of them use it. The liquor based ones that I have made were not strong to me, but they might be to someone that is sensitive. In my opinion, the alcohol cooks off in the cooking prosses, so what is left the the flavor of the liqour it's self.I would suggest that you put a little more sugar in the filling or in the crust, if you like it sweet. Also, I like to put some brown sugar in the filling, even if the recipe does not call for it. It adds a wonderful rich color to the cakes."
1,Like heavy alcohol flavor in your cheesecakes?,"While this book is pretty in looks, the recipes are extremely heavy in alcohol flavor. I like the flavor of alcohol in foods, but these recipes are very strong -- almost all recipes include alcohol, and many include very hard to find liquers. And the recipes do not yeild the firm texture I prefer."
5,Cheesecake Extraordinaire,"Gave one to my son years ago and he enjoyed it so much, wanted one for myself. Unable to purchase in a store so was very happy to be able to find on Amazon. It's a great cheesecake cookbook. Sorry I didn't have it years ago when I was doing more entertaining."
3,Flawed by its maps,"I tried the Roadmate 700 first which only differs by having a hard drive with all of the U.S. street level maps on disk. The 300 allows for regional maps stored on SD memory cards or an ample 80 MB built into the unit. As you can create any regional map from the supplied CD, the 300 is a much better deal.In addition, I think that you can copy the base European roads maps from the supplied CD into the 300 and use it for major highway routing in Europe. I found that after receiving a defective unit and had to figure out how it worked.My major problem is that the street level regional maps are either very accurate, or ridicuously wrong. If the underlying map is accurate the unit works fine although it does some perculiar routing directing you around town.If the underlying maps are off, you will be become hopelessly lost so take the street level directions with a grain of salt.I spoke to Magellan and I was offered updated maps for $99. What a deal!On balance, a work in progress."
1,Buy a Garmin,The PC interface is cumbersome. The manual is vague and incomplete. Maps are outdated and often just incorrect. Support is poor to nonexistent. The unit stopped functioning completely in 18 months.
1,Takes forever to acquire GPS signal,"The unit works fine once it acquires a GPS signal. Problem is it ALWAYS takes 7-10 minutes to acquire a signal. I have followed all the directions. My hand held will acquire in seconds. The magellan, once it acquires a signal, works fine. Their customer service was useless. They cut and pasted the same words from their user manual when I asked them about it. I set the location, I waited many minutes before departing, the unit had a clear view of the sky etc ... I suspect that the cost differences between this unit and the 500/700 have to do with the quality of the signal acquisition circuits. Of course I will not find out as I will go elsewhere. The GPS status screen showed multiple satalites with good signal but the unit still took minutes to lock the position. If you want the feel of the typical neverlost you get in rental cars this is not the unit for you ... you will get to your destination before the Magellan 300 acquires a GPS lock."
1,Not Worth the Money,"I bought this for my husband a year and a half ago and have had nothing but problems. He travels for a living and needs it to go to his sales appointments. It failed on him several times and was replaced (with a refurbished model) by Magellan and that has failed several times also. Very frustrating when you are 20 miles past your turnoff and don't know it because the GPS has frozen. We are currently looking for another to replace it and would not consider another Magellan, at any price."
2,Magellan 300,"I bought Magellan 300, it looked great, awesome interface however it took 2 hours to pick up the initial signal. After you turn off the unit and then turn it back on, it takes 30 minutes to aquire a signal which is simply not good enough. Also, while you have a signal and follow the preprogrammed route you are unable to view near points of interest, etc. unless you stop or cancel the route which is a huge inconvenience. The map downlad time was almost an hour too. I returned the Magellan and purchased Garmin Quest which is SIMPLY AWESOME!!! Get the signal instantly, map uploads in 15 minutes and it works wonderfully both indoor and outdoor!"
3,direction & voice commands is very poor,"So many voice commands differes from original direction shown in unit. recently started to freeze after year usage.So many time calculate wrong directions even. Takes you to no where, than calcuate direction again from there no where place.But support from India, is very good. The can listen problem & try to solve it best the can. Somebody saying support is not good, try to call verizon or motorola support. Than compare."
1,why no battery? check out Garmin Quest as better value,Disappointing that Magellan failed to make this new Roadmate 300 unit with optional battery power. Otherwise there's not alot to distinguish it from the Roadmate 500 it replaces. A much better value is either the new Garmin Quest GPS or Navman 510 which both have internal rechargable battery with voice prompts.
1,Terrible Experience,"I live in Boston - but I'm not from Boston, and get lost more than I'd like to admit. After the last hysterical phonecall from me (""Where am I?!"") my husband decided to purchase the Magellan 300 for me. It was a waste of our time, but not our money since we just returned it. The Magellan struggled to pick up a signal (like other reviewers, I want to point out that I live and drive in a major metropolitan area, so why is the signal so bad?) every time I used it; clouds and trees seem to knock out the signal entirely. What good is a a GPS system if it takes 15 minutes to find you? If you are considering purchasing a GPS system, look elsewhere."
4,Its growing on me...,"After 2 months of owning the GPS and growing all but frustrated with LARGE delays associated with rerouting, Magellan surprised me! Several months after release, the company seems to still care about its products. Several days ago, I received an email from the company alerting me to an update to their software (v1.65) which took care of the major complaint I had with the unit. The unit is now faster to reroute me when I miss that precious turn in unknown territory, and appears to run solidly. I must say I am now enjoying the full potential of the unit and am happy with the purchase!"
4,Excellent buy!,"I bought this unit after much research. And I am glad I made this decision.The size, both unit and the screen is perfect. I compared with Garmin's I3 and 2610. Unit handling is good and not bulky like the 2610. The screen size of this unit is ideal, with all the info that needs to be accomodated on the screen.I found my unit quite responsive and had good satellite reception (even when I placed it in my cup holder!). Color coding of signal strength is a great plus. Unit has a ton of options on locating points of interests. I also checked the speedometer in the unit and it was accurate down to the last mile. I was really impressed.The only thing I found unacceptable was the long upload time for the maps into the unit. But I have heard units from other manufacturers too have the same issue. But on the road performance is fantastic for the price that I paid at Sears."
1,Good luck setting it up,"Wasted over three hours trying to get it to work. Out of the box, it had no detailed maps for anything. I spent 2 hours 'uploading' maps onto an SD card which you have to 'authorize' first. How can anything take TWO HOURS to transfer to an SD card?!? The supplied software is remarkably bad. Anyway, after all that, the unit refused to initialize maps and would only beep obnoxiously anytime a button was pressed. 'Turn it on and go' is their slogan. Turn it on and go where? Back to the store to return it."
1,"Product stopped working after 1 year, Magellan unresponsive--don't purchase!","I loved this product when I got it as a Christmas gift, but my Roadmate 300 quit working 12 months after I received it. I called Magellen and was told that this product was ""obsolete"" and there wasn't any recovery software for it. They also told me that I could pay $150 for a ""replacement."" What a joke. Go with a Garmin or Tom Tom instead."
2,Great unit when it finally works!!!,"The Roadmate 300 is an awesome unit when it finnally picks up a signal. Therin lies the problem. Somtimes the unit goes 15-20 minutes without actually finding where the car is located. And I am not located in the ""Boonies"" either. I tried it in both Chicago and Denver with the same results. About 50% of the time it does not pick up the signal for long periods of time. Once it does, howevr, this thing rocks!"
3,"Got me to Cedar Point, great gps.. but OUTDATED!!!","I called Magellan about updating the maps, and they said this unit is going to be discontinued and it is impossible to update it. I'd have to trade it in for a new one. So they wanted me to pay $200 after trading this unit in. If you call Magellan and are stubborn enough, they should be able to work out sending you a free Maestro (which they are for me). Cause I bought the Roadmate 300 like last November and they are telling me it is getting discontinued already?!?!So BUYER BEWARE... SAVE YOUR MONEY AND TIME- DON'T BUY THIS simply because its getting discontinued and maps can't be upgraded from what I'm told! Spend an extra $60 from the used prices of this one and get a Maestro.. they seem to be great!"
3,High marks for the item / low marks for Magellan updates...,It has been about 3 years since the maps were updated and support cannot/will not give us an answer when or EVEN IF the maps will ever be updated. Its is a great value for the price but if you live in an area with lots of development you will likely find many areas that are not on the map![...]
1,Service should keep you away from all Magellan products,"Stay away from Magellan all together. Bought the RoadMate 300 last Black Friday (Nov. 24, 2006). Pretty good unit for the price, had intermittent problems connecting to the satellite. Finally went. Called Magellan in August 2007, received a Return Authorization. They supposedly have a 14 day return policy. Well it is now almost November again and after numerous calls to Magellan still no GPS. They use outsourced phone representatives, so you can not be assured that they actually understand what you are saying and I have had a very hard time understanding them most times. After numerous promises that the replacement GPS is on the way and refusal to provide a tracking number as of today I got off the phone with them and started filing complaints with the BBB and the attorney general. Pay more and stay away from Magellan. They don't care about you once they have your $$$."
3,Like a collection of short stories,"This book is very witty. I saw the movie before I read the book, and if the movie had to contain everything that's in the book, it would have to be in two or three parts.It's like Winston Groom wants to tell everything about post-War history and society in the USA, and the idea of seeing this through the eyes and wisdom of a supposedly less intelligent and man with a big heart is a good idea. It makes you learn, think, laugh and cry. Even the language of Forrest Gump is on an intentionally low and naive level."
1,Direct Change,"''Forrest Gump'', the movie, was magical, funny, touching, and great. The novel was a piece of trash. The character in the book was a brute who had a fascination with the s-word. Throw the book in the fireplace. See the movie."
3,Average,"If you have watched the flm, there s no need for reading this book which is by no means near to the movie. The story seems quite silly when read, mainly because of some parts missing in the movie. If you have plenty of spare time, may be, but better buy the movie."
4,entertaining,"I thought Forrest Gump was one of the best movies I had ever seen, so I came to read the book with high expectations. I was in for a surprise, however, but a really enjoyable surprise it was. The surprise was that the movie had very very little to do with the book (even less than you would usually expect) but the book had its own smorgasbord of utterly unbelievable events and comedy. The undercurrent is pretty much the same as the movie; Forrest is not as stupid as we would like to think. The ending was quite tame for such a rollicking story, however. Anyway if you're in need of something funny, pick it up."
3,Rare: movie better than book,"I saw the movie before reading the book as probably most did. The book was loosely strung together to say the least and not terribly interesting until you get about half way through. At that point the book drastically diverges from the movie's take on Gump's experiences. Gump becomes involved with NASA (against his will) and then some Cannibals followed by a stint as a studio wrestler and a champian chess player. He even gets a chance to meet Raquel Welch! This divergence lends a sense of the surreal that becomes much more interesting for us to read than the plausible but boring ""idiot"" trouble Forrest gets into earlier in the book."
2,Didn't like the book OR the movie,"I thought Gump the movie was 3 hours of mindless schmaltz, but after reading the book I can understand why Zemeckis didn't stay true to Groom's novel. Book Gump just isn't likable at all. Instead of an oafish, lovable doofus who spouts memorable catchphrases we have a pot-smoking, even dimmer doofus whose adventures are even more ludicrous than those shown in the film (the one with Raquel Welch was just too much).Jenny comes off even worse in the book, if that's possible, and Forrest's narration gets irritating after a while. People either love the movie and hate the book or vice-versa, but I just didn't like either of them."
1,Don't but this book -- get the movie instead.,"This is the only time I have ever believed a movie to be better than the book on which it was based. Groom's Forrest Gump is a big redneck with a foul mouth -- not the endearing, lovable character Tom Hanks played. I remember when the movie Forrest Gump came out, and I heard that Winston Groom was suing because he never got all the money he was promised. If he got five dollars, it was more than he deserved."
1,a month later and still no product!,"I ordered this book over a month ago and STILL HAVEN'T RECEIVED IT! They were quick to take the money out of my account, but apparently have no concept of time and little to no consideration in terms of getting the actual product to me. DO NOT ORDER THROUGH THIS COMPANY (World of Books)!"
4,Even Funnier and more unbelievable than the movie.,"If you thought that in the movie Forrest's life was crammed with once-in-a-lifetime events, you should try reading the book. While not as touching, the novel delivers quite a few more laughs than the movie. The main difference is that Forrest is a little rougher around the edges; however, he is just as likable."
4,Forreest Gump,"Winston Groom, the author of the book Forrest Gump has a great mind to think up all of the conflicts Forrest encountered throughout his journey. This book contains much adult material but it all makes the story come together in the end. This book made me laugh almost every chapter even though some of it shouldn't have been funny. From the army to going to space Forrest Gump is an amazing man who wasn't that smart, which tells you that you can do anything that you put you mind to."
4,"Difficult to get started, but rewarding in the end","This book is written from the point of view of an idiot savant, a person of limited intelligence who is yet extremely smart in specific areas. To capture this point of view, the author writes in a semi-literate first person. Here is a sample sentence. ""My daddy, he got kilt just after I's born, so I never known him."" A whole novel in this format is difficult to read. Yet once the reader adjusts to the style, the story is a very touching one of true values. The book is different from the movie in details but not in theme and both have their own charm."
4,"Very, very funny","I am one of the handful of people on this earth not to have seen the movie, but after reading the book I have no desire to do so. The book is just so funny that the movie could only be a disappointment. My favourite favourite scene is the chess match in which Forrest and his opponent try to outwit one another by endless set moves, but I found a number of scenes funny enough to laugh out loud, which I hardly ever do when reading a book.I also liked the portrayal of Forrest as someone who realises that he is not normal, and who is bothered by being different. Certainly not the happy-go-lucky idiot of the movie (I have, inevitably, seen some snippets). Actually, I have a confession to make: My main reason for not wanting to see the movie is that I hate Tom Hanks. But I digress, read the book and try not to spoil it for yourself by picturing TH as Forrest."
2,"I usually like the book better, but not this time.","This is one of the few times where I beleive the movie is way better than the book. Usually it is the other way around for me, but in this case I saw the movie first and then decided to read the book. This book is nothing like the movie! I liked the movie, I thought it was entertaining, it captured a range of experiences and emotions. Good movie, great story! The book was not like that at all! The book was terribly silly, even more far fetched than the movie was."
1,This book was the WORST I have ever read.,I love to read and don't like to leave books unfinished - that is the ONLY reason I finished this one. It was sooo much worse than the movie - I agree with others that it is amazing that such a good movie came from this mockery of literature. I would never recommend this to anyone except for them to see just how believable the movie is compared to the book. I feel this review is inadequate because I can't think of anything bad enough to say about this book. It truly stinks and isn't worth the time. (I also agree that it is a shame I couldn't give it 0 stars.)
1,Dissapointing if you saw the movie first!,"Don't watch the movie first if you haven't read the book!This book is totally different than the movie in a bad way.I loved the movie ,but the book was totally different.The book portrayed Forrest as a complete loser in life and love.The movie portrayed him as a hero of pop culture.His relationship with Jenny was not the love story portrayed on screen.Most movies I have seen are true to the book most of the time.This one was not."
2,OK,"This is indoor only and can't be clear coated or the finished is ruined. Also, the paint can't be touched even when cured so its not good for surfaces that need to be handled."
4,Received it,"It did have some notes in it just like you have describe, Thank you, it will come in handy by making a great reference tool for my Intermediate and Introduction Chemistry of Class."
1,Mislead and unable to contact,The description for this book said it would be a hardback and I received a paperback with the pictures in black and white! There was no way to contact seller I could only choose to return book when I needed it for class! I had to purchase another book so I can return this one once I recieve it! Horrible and misleading I want my money back for all the hassle!
5,"After reading this book, I sure got a country look!",Mary Seehafer Sears is a country-decorating God.
5,Perfect for our Cusinart PowerBlend Duet blender,"It works great with our Cuisinart PowerBlend Duet blender. (Since the description doesn't specify what models it fits, we are offering ours for your reference.) It is just like the original.with the price of $2.89 and free shipping, it's really a bargain!"
3,works but a little plain,"I do like this deodorant, the price is a little more than usual I like to spend on toiletries, but I wanted a unique product. The scent isn't too strong, but it does seem to help in stopping the sweat. The scent is pretty plain, was expecting something a little more unique in that sense; but overall a decent product especially if you want something plain without an overpowering smell; only question then is it worth the premium price."
5,Best guys deodorant out there!,This is awesome stuff! Absolutely the best deodorant and anti-perspirant that lasts you a good 10-12 hours. Even at $15 it is well worth the cash. Has a great juniper smell to it
1,strong smell,"I haven't been able to place the cleaning solvent that smells a bit like this deodorant. I can see people wanting to wear perfume to make a statement, but I can't imagine anyone who likes their deodorant to be detectable. By the end of the first and only day I used it, I was getting nauseated at the strong smell.Also, I think Mitchum's works better."
3,Meh...,"Mediocre at best. I've spent half of this price for better performance. Leaves underarms sticky, and doesn't provide whole day protection. Clinique was far superior without the terrible fragrance."
2,bad residue,"i'm a big fan of Jack Black products, but this deodorant is a disappointment. it leaves a residue that doesn't wash off well, even with the company's own body wash. it protects for a lot longer than normal deodorants, but it almost isn't worth it when trying to be rid of it in the shower."
1,VERY disappointed,"I've had this product for around 5 months now and have had all of the problems described in other reviews. EdgeGuard doesn't work after first few weeks, shoots more to the left than to the right and doesn't stop distributing the fertilizer when you release the handle. I'm sorry to say it but DO NOT buy this one."
2,broken flap better than nothing,"i found edgeguard flap mechanism broke after a couple of uses. I now need to pull it open and closed manually. It's pretty annoying. I've also noticed it spreads somewhat unevenly to the left even with guard pulled back.the edgeguard flap mechanism appears very flimsy and cheaply made. I would get another, but I expect that none of the flaps are very reliable on this model.Home depot or lowes didnt have a spreader other than this that had a retractable ""edgeguard"" flap, which i like because it keeps fertilizer off flower beds and bushes and driveways.The fertilizer drop door mechanism has held up however and the fertilizer doesnt clump. I was disappointed in the quality of this product"
1,"This is a piece of crap, do not buy!!!","Bought this spreader at Lowes after our old Scott's finally broke. This is a piece of junk. I puts out SO MUCH fertilizer even at the lowest setting. It put over 30,000 sq ft of fertilizers when it I should have covered the ground with 10,000 sq ft. Basically, I spent (...) in fertilizers when it should have been enough with (...). The minimum setting is 2 and it spits our more fertilizer than my old one in a 10. Two is the lowest setting. Do not buy this piece of junk. You will regret it. It also spreads more fertilizer on one side than the other. Bad all around!!!"
1,Poor quality,"For the price, this spreader is very poor. After using it three times, two last fall and once this spring, the unit broke. Don't buy it."
1,Don't buy - a piece of junk,Edge guard broken after a few uses. Doesn't spread evenly. Very poor quality for a Scotts product. Buy something else.
3,Not as adverstised,I rated the unit 3 stars simply because its a nice piece of equipment however the one which I purchased and received was not as advertised. I was supposed to be getting a used-good condition spreader however when it arrived it was missing both controls on the handle as well as the cables for their connection. Overall not happy with the purchase and wished I hadn't waste my time and just gone to Home Depot.
1,Firehouse,"I purchased this dvd movie from ""Once Around the Block"", it skipped and froze several places throughout the movie. I tried to contact the seller regarding the problem, all I wanted was a replacement and they never would respond to my e-mails. I am really disappointed in the product because of it skipping and freezing, and even more disappointed in the seller never responding to my request, not even a word from them. I don't intend to ever purchase from this seller again if that is the way they do business."
2,Pass this one up!,"This software prevents the downloading of your digital pictures to your desk top. I found this extremely annoying. Apprently, this program only lets you download intial photos into the program which locks you into "" Picture It "". If you need to keep your photos into a seperate desktop file, you would be in a distinct disadvantage. On the positive side, it is extremely easy to format 8X10's in this program."
1,A Three Trick Dog,"In candor...This program does the same three things that every...photo program does, except it costs more ... Anyone seriously considering it should look long and hard at _Photoshop Elements_ first. The difference in price is small; the difference in function is spectacular. I wish someone had told me this before I wasted my money on this dog."
2,Disappointing,"I am disappointed because: (i) it takes many steps to get pictures into the ""tray"" for editing, (ii) it is loaded with preset forms that are useless -- I want a program with a large variety of unadorned, pre-designed album sheets (without any prior designs), such as the program that came FREE with my HP printer. This doesn't have a single one. All it has is one clean sheet, and each photo has to be separately sized. It's useful, I guess, for special projects, but difficult if one wants to print out album pages with a variety of photos."
3,Dissapointed,"I thought I would be able to do great things with this software, but it does little more than what comes with Kodak Picture CD - it just takes longer. I had problems with it crashing that turned out to be a conflict with Norton Antivirus. To be fair, I haven't spent a lot of time trying to become more familiar with the program. I haven't found it to be very intuitive."
3,inspiring for children struggling with school and friends.,"My son (age 7) was so impressed to find out that one of the greatest minds of all time wasn't the best in school, nor was he the most popular. Einstein was different in so many ways and the book shows how being different didn't seem to bother him at all--a great lesson!"
1,Disappointing and depressing book about Einstein's chilhood,"I was looking for scientfic biographies for young readers and came across this bio of Einstein. It is very disappointing and depressing in many ways. Also sends the wrong message to most children. ""Albert did not like school..refused to memorize any lessons."" This may have been true, but the book doesn't properly explain why. There is also no scientific content in the book and it covers only Einstein's childhood. It could be inspirational to some kids who are having trouble in school, but I doubt very many. It is also very brief -- approx 20 pages with a paragraph on each. The Science Discoveries series by Chelsea House Publishers is far superior for those who are looking for books with both biographical and scientific content."
3,Not as good as the sum of its parts,"This film is proof that you can put together every funny actor you can get your hands on into one film and it still won't be funny without writing that plays to their strengths. Marty Feldman, Cheech and Chong, John Cleese, Chapman and a host of others from both sides of the pond are in this film and yet it never really takes off. It's still a good movie, playing off of lots of cliches from other pirate films, but it depends on gratuitous nudity and bathroom humor in small doses to carry it the rest of the way."
3,high expectations,I remember this movie being the funniest movie of all times. Then 20 years past...not so funny. It seems that they just didn't connect with the writers. Still a must have for Python and Cheach fans.
3,wheres cheech and chong?,"this movie leaves one thing out, cheech and chong, they are barely in the movie for 5 minutes and they have 2 parts in the whole movie, whats up with that? i mean you look at the front of the dvd and it shows them in big picture and yellow beard and his wife in small picture along with the men who follow him ni the movie. all you see in the whole movie is, well yellowbeard like the title. dont get me wrong the movie was funny in parts, and its hard to tell john cleese as blind pew but its still a good movie"
5,so funny,This has to be one of the all time funniest movies I've ever watched. If your down in the dumps watch this and you'll feel better. The gags and punch lines are classic. One can not help enjoy this movie.
5,AAAARRRRGGGGGHHHHH,"I have always been a fan of Monte Python, so typically this movie is not a blur in my past. Excellent film portraying a pirate back in the day. If you are in the mood for a little British humor this would be the film for you."
2,Yellowbeard....not for the squeamish,"For die-hard Monty Python fans only. Poorley written, acted, and directed. Still, enjoyable to those with a corny sense of humor and love for the antics of the Python crew."
5,HILARIOUS!,You like the Monty Python? I love the Monty Python - and this has so much MORE with the Monty Python (not all members of Monty Python appear in this movie). You want to laugh? WATCH THIS. You want to laugh a LOT? BUY THIS!
5,One of the greatest of all time...,"For fans of the Python, this is one of the greatest movies of all time. You will be in tears the entire time. Let's just hope someday they remaster and re-release it on DVD"
5,Just Wonderful.,"YEP, another off the wall comedy with the likes of the 'Python' crew, Mel Brookes, and Marty Feldman...to name but a few...where could you go wrong! This hilarious comedy is definitely Under-rated..with a capital U. If it was re-released today it would still probably bomb...because the film critics who review these things..haven't got the foggiest notion what a good wholesome comedy IS! get it! you will NOT be disappointed!."
2,I must be getting old,"This wasn't as funny as I remember it back in the day. Maybe I'm just getting old. Good for a few chuckles, but not really worth the time."
3,Monte Python meets Mel Brooks in this pirate comedy,"3 of 5 stars for the movie comedy Yellowbeard. Monte Python meets Mel Brooks. Well this comedy parity of pirate movies combines the talents of Monte Python (Idle, Chapman, Cleese) with Mel Brooks' team (Mars, Kahn, Feldman, Boyle). The result is a funny lightweight comedy. Richly photographed, lots of sight gags and funny dialog. This is truly a turn your brain off, sit back and relax funny movie! If you are looking for a deep plot with lots of drama or suspense, don't look here! Yes, I do recommend this!"
5,Funny Movie,"This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. I was very happy to see it come out on DVD. The image quality is very good and the sound (mono) is good too. I have the tape but now watch the DVD exclusively. I probably have seen this movie 50 times and have not got tired of it. Favorite line: ""They'll have to kill me before I die""."
2,What were they thinking???,"The cast is fabulous. The costumes were nice. The reviews that I read were all positive. We watched about a half an hour of this snooze fest, before turning it off. To say that we were disappointed would have to be an understatement. The plot was slow. The jokes, if you can call them that, were not funny, at all. Dreadful. I am giving it two stars only because of the remarkable cast."
2,Cheech & Chong as well as Madeline Kahn are in this film.,Cheech & Chong (Richard Marin and Thomas Chong) do appear at the beginning of this film and later for the build-up to the climax. Meanwhile we are entertained by an all-star cast. Madeline Kahn is a delight to watch. Martin Hewitt (Endless Love [1981]) has the role as the son of Yellowbeard who has a treasure chest map tattoed on his head. The next Cheech & Chong film is CHEECH & CHONG'S THE CORSICAN BROTHERS (1984)
2,Beware of 80's movie ratings!,"Unfortunately, this is not a PG rating according to today's standards. I was very disappointed that during the second half of the movie they decided to throw in an island full of topless women. I chose not to finish the movie. Also, there are a number of references to rape, and even a couple of scenes where the act of rape is being implied. For some reason, it seems that many movies from the 80's had to throw in inappropriate 2 second blips of random nudity, and they were still able to slap a PG rating on the production.If it weren't for my disappointment, due to the crudeness of the show, I think it would actually have been a fun movie. The acting was better than I had planned on (there are a bunch of classic actors in this), and there were some really funny scenes. Unfortunately, filth ruins a movie for me every time. If it weren't for the garbage in this movie I would have given it at least 3 stars."
2,"Sorry to Differ From the Crowd, But...","As Mr. Hartounian (Jackie Mason) said, ""We don't have defective cans, we got a defective person here!"" Upon very brief reflection, I've realized that it's not my senses and sensibilities that are out of whack, I'm happy to say. But if all those folks who hail this cinematic shmatta as a classic are happy in Fantasyland, who am I to argue with them? Why, you may wonder, do I bestow as many as 2 stars on this thing? For the truly droll performance of Mr. James Mason, highlighted by his hilarious introduction of the redoubtable Mister Prostitute."
3,Choatic but funny,"Yellowbeard is a chaotic but funny movie. The story itself isn't really that important. Watching part of the Monty Python's cast work together with Cheech and Chong made it for me worth it. I think a lot of chances were missed with this movie though. It seems as if the director had some difficulty in deciding which way he wanted to go with this movie. You notice this as the movie sometimes makes efforts not to go into full absurdity. Monty Python's Graham Chapman is quite funny as Yellowbeard, but Tommy Chong's El Nebuloso is fantastic.(SARR)"
5,Best Python Movie EVER!,"This is by far the best Monty Python movie EVER! If you get the chance, see it. If you get the chance, buy it and let me know where you found it! I can't wait for it to come out on DVD!!!"
5,A Great Comedy. Why in the heck isn't it for sale or rent?,"The story line was great, the characters were great ( a women pirate named Mr. Prostitute)."
5,Classic Comedy,"Please someone, correct the injustice of this film being out of print. This is a combination of comedy talents not seen since the heyday of the Mel Brooks films Blazing Saddles, High Anxiety, and Young Frankenstein. I have killed two previously viewed copies that were well worn when I got hold of them."
3,Yellowbeard...Monty Python meets Cheech and Chong!!,"Somewhat of a forgotten period piece comedy, YELLOWBEARD, stars a couple of the Monty Python troupe and Cheech and Chong? There are many funny bits and some good comedic perfomances by Madeline Kahn, Marty Feldman, and Eric Idle with cameos by David Bowie and Peter Cook. Story by Python, Graham Chapman (also in the title role), about a ruthless pirate and his search for buried treasure, and everyone who is after Yellowbeard and the buried loot. Perhaps it would have been funnier if the whole Monty Python Troup had appeared with their patented use of taking on multiple roles etc. Otherwise, the script and plot are predictable. A last comedic glimpse of Kahn, Feldman, Cook, and even Graham Chapman who have since passed away."
4,Love this movie,"The comedic absurdity of Monty Python, Cheech & Chong, and Mel Brooks all in one? Winner."
2,Beware of Region 2 DVDs,This DVD was for Region 2 and nothing in the ad indicated this. It will not play in my DVD player. If I had known this I would not have ordered it. I was able to get it to play on my laptop by changing the region.
1,Sucked,Didn't play at all! Not in this hemishpere anyway! complete waste! Need I say anything more? I reckon so! BS
2,Look Elsewhere,"Programming is very time consuming and can get down right frustrating. And the extra price for the useless remote control is silly. Come on, who seriously uses a remote control when you can just reach up & push the buttons or turn a knob, especially while you're trying to drive safely. Quality of the sound however is quite good, but then again most radidios in this price range are worthy of quality speakers, such as the SR60's from BA that are in my car. This radidio really, really needs a SD memory card slot. Even a USB slot would have been acceptable, but I hate having a wire flopping around from my I-Pod."
5,Great product,Product helps to give deeper understanding of scriptures by stating in plain English and also by giving detailed explanations in the footnotes; also explains how scriptures apply to everyday life.
4,Hidden Leaf headband...,"Obviously if you're a real Naruto fan you need a leaf village head band :) Ive only bought this one so far but as far as I can tell, it can't get much better. You get exactly what you see in the picture and it looks almost exactly like what you see on those anime foreheads :P First of all, the insignia plate is real metal. It's actually impressive how heavy it feels in the hand. Second of all, it's fun to wear. The size is comfortable, plenty of growing room, yet not so big it looks ackward. Don't worry about it being to small either!I guess the only con is just how wide the band actually is. This thing covers the whole forehead, atleast down to the eye-brows. This isn't for little ninjas.All together, this can't get much better. The material is comfortable, the logo is shaped well, and it fits like a charm. If it was just a little smaller wide-wise I'd give it a 5. Can't go wrong with the leaf village.-The 4th Hokage (lol)"
1,Not a GE headband.,It was one of the bad ones with the paint and not a Great Eastern one. It is not what is pictured and I am mad because this the the third time this has happend. buy from Ebay.
1,5 star toy... if you get it :(,"I used to have this same headband till it was misplaced, so I decided to buy a new one, I made a mistake by choosing ty's toy box I guess. The package never arrived, and the tracking link was broken. So I emailed the company and while they say it usually takes less than 24 hours to get a responce, It took me 5 days for each email to be replyed on. This is a great toy, just make sure that the seller can actualy diliver, or youll be 20$ down with no help in sight."
4,real deal,this is real metal authentic looking headband very well made. good customer service I did not get the one ordered first and when I emailed they send me another on right away
3,A bit expensive,"This was fun for his Halloween costume but it slips of his head a bit so he never wears it now that Halloween is over. Good for dress up but not worth the cost, good quality though."
1,never recieved,"never recieved the item, I inquired about it no responsevery dissappointed.I will never order here anymore."
3,naruto headband for 13 y.o. boy,It was cotton cloth with a piece of metal attached--what can I say. I think the price for that kind of thing was too much (price w/S&H was $17.88--price gauging for sure!). It was ill fitting because the piece of metal stuck out and my husband had to bend it to fit the contour of my son's head. My son does like it (headband is a popular item with his age group in school) & I made him pay for it himself. He'll learn...
5,Vivid.,"Before I begin I would like to emphasize that rape is not only wrong but should be punished harshly. : )When I see those guys cheering Jodie Fauster getting raped (believe me guys it is not arousing at all), I wanted Nelly Mcgillis to throw the book at them and at all men in general. Sex is suppose to be beautiful and enjoyable, but rape is unpleasurable for Jodie Fauster, Nelly Mcgillis, the three rapists, the viewer, and anyone reading this review. I liked seeing the friendship that developed between Nelly, Jodie and the boy witness. The story is awesome, the acting is spectacular the plotholes plunging, and the rape interesting. When I was younger (two years ago), I was violated repeatedly. It hurt my pride and backside. But I am stronger now at seventeen and can deal with the pain. This movie is a powerful reminder of how all rapists should be handled.END: )"
1,Never got to see it,"I couldn't play this DVD. It must be in some non-US format, which I didn't realize when I bought it."
4,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Aside from the extremely disquieting and graphic rape sequence, this film is pretty formulaic and essentially what you'd expect going in; it's well-made enough to be worth recommending if you like courtroom dramas but it's not terribly memorable."
1,this movie is awful,"i hated this movie, if i could give it negative rating i would, as a woman i think rape is awful, but , dont put your self in a compamising postion, and rub you body against someone when you are wearing provactive clothes, and you are very drunk. and feeling up the guy you are making out with,and then after the rape her charcter continue to wear provactive clothing, i also dont like jodie foster, she is one of the most overrated actresses of my generation , and her deep masculine voice,and bad acting annoys me. i dont like any movie she makes,"
2,A familiar story expertly executed,"Jodie Foster deserved an Academy Award nomination with her role as young Sarah, who gets gang-raped in a sleasy bar one night.Kelly McGillis plays the district attourney who takes Sarahs case and starts a battle to get the truth uncovered. This is hard, as Sarah is repeatedly been accused to have encouraged her assaultants and is been considered to be a bad witness because of her intoxicated condition during the crime and her previous police record involving drugs charges.The story is familiar, predictable and lacks in the field of credibility. It manages to somewhat avoid sentimentality, though, even if some of it's still aparent.The acting performances are good and Jonathan Kaplan's directing is well paced and talented.All these aspects turn an otherewise horrible picture into a watchable one."
3,Jodie Foster Shines in a Lackluster Film,"The storyline moves somewhat slowly, the conclusion is anti-climactic, and the characterizations are overly-stereotypical. The performances leave a lot to be desired...except, of course, for Jodie Foster's powerful performance for which she received her first Academy Award. Foster gives a truly remarkable portrayal of Sarah Tobias, a woman gang raped on a pinball machine in a bar. Her character provides an emotional depth which is simply lacking in the others. Despite its many flaws, this film is worth watching just to see Jodie's acting skills."
5,An excellent movie,"Pros:1)DVD has some good features and history2)Talks about a sensitive subject- rape3)Jodie Foster does a A+ job acting as a rape victim.4)A good teaching too for Women's group, organizations, or rape training.Cons:1)You can get away with this for VHS.A good movie"
4,Absorbing drama!,"This is a powerful and tense script loaded of full realism. Foster plays the role of an uninhibited woman who decides to fit adjusted pants, exposing great latitudes of her anatomy. This will be the initial premise which will become a true nightmare for her, when the passions ignite the low depths of drunk boys.The investigation and exposure of motives will be carried to the Court where it will be an interesting exchange of opinions and accusations. The script is well written and the suspense will be waiting for you all along.Jodie Foster won his first coveted Prize as Best Actress playing this role."
3,So-so film with strong acting (more like 3.5 stars),"""The Accused"" is more or less a standard drama with a second act which plays like a run-of-the-mill episode from Law & Order. However, the film works mostly due to Jodie Foster's powerhouseperformance as the rape victim. Her performance was such that she'd garner an oscar for it and would be hailed unassailably as one of the best actresses of her generation. It's too bad the film never quite gels. The courtroom scenes (especially the final summation) play rather too long. Furthermore, the explicitness of the rape scene (shown late in the film as a flashback) and the intensity of the foul language also mars it badly. Finally, Kelly Mcgillis' performance somewhat pales in comparison with that of Foster's. Despite these aspects, the film is still a must for anyone who likes to collect movies."
1,Date expried soaps,"I love this soap. From the past 10 years I am using this brand.Couple of weeks before, I bought 12 soaps. The soaps were delivered on time but all soaps are expired from the date of Manufacture. Just they put another yellow sticker on the top of the MFD. Its really unworthy to by this item"
4,Great mix of songs,"I bought this for a few specific songs and when I listened to the whole CD was very pleased - great songs from real artists like Peter Gabriel, REM, Bob Dylan, Paul McCartney, Jeff Buckley, etc. So long as you're not looking for American Idol pop-crap, then this would be for you..."
5,Another great soundtrack for a Cameron Crowe movie,"Every Cameron Crowe movie I've seen so far (Jerry Maguire, Almost Famous) has been characterized, among other things, by a fabulous selection of music and a score put together by his wife, Nancy Wilson. Vanilla Sky is no exception to the rule, with tracks from some of today's and yesterday's biggest names (Radiohead, Peter Gabriel, Bob Dylan, Paul McCartney, etc.) coupled with some new acts, such as the case of the Icelandic band Sigur Ros (I highly recommend their album, ""Agaetis Byrjun""). My favorites from this album are McCartney's new song titled after the movie, Nancy Wilson's track and the incredibly beautiful ""Sweetness Follows"" by Georgia's very own R.E.M. and Peter Gabriel's ""Solsbury Hill,"" which play incredibly well with the rest of the music."
3,Can't figure out the song,"On the DVD, during the ""Prelude to a Dream"" video there's a song playing. If anyone knows the song please email me at chevrolangie@yahoo.com."
5,help?,hey i was wondering that name of the song in the beginning of the movie where he is on the street and hes dreaming and he gets out of his car and starts running.. it almost sounds like some kind of techno. but it would be a great help if i can know what that sond was. thanks alot byebye
1,The name of that song,"Hey this is to answer Eric Perrotta's question in his review... the name of that song is ""The Nothing Song"" by Sigur Ros. I have an obsession with that song too lol."
5,Vanilla Sky track listings:,"Since Amazon ..has... failed to list the artists and the tracks on this soundtrack, which I was looking for, I'm going to go ahead and list them myself because I finally found them somewhere else. Hopefully this will save other people the same trouble.Track Listing:1. All The Right Friends - R.E.M.2. Everything In Its Right Place - Radiohead3. Vanilla Sky - Paul McCartney4. Solsbury Hill - Peter Gabriel5. I Fall Apart - Julianna Gianni6. Porpoise Song - The Monkees7. Looper - Mondo '77 (Featuring Francis MacDonald)8. Have You Forgotten - Red House Painters9.

Fourth Time Around - Bob Dylan15. Elevator Beat - Nancy Wilson16. Sweetness Follows - R.E.M.17. Where Do I Begin - The Chemical Bros."
4,Almost a 5,"This would be a five if it had more songs from the movie, but alas it does not. Still you can sit and enjoy this record. The movie was good and the soundtrack is good also. Not the best, but still worth the purchase. Lot of variety of good tunes to listen to. So buy it....right now!"
4,help,"hey, looking for away to contact Alex, who reviewed this cd with the list of 41 tracks. I am very interested in them, but can't find a way to email him. Any help?"
3,Dance Club Techno Tune?,Pretty Good flickit deffinately left a couple of tunes bouncin around in my headbut what was the tune that was played in the dance club when tom was all hammered and dancin around with his mask on backwards.
1,Where are all the good vibrations?,"I was going to buy this CD until I noticed that Good Vibrations by the Beach Boys didn't make it on. And why not I might ask. Hearing that song on the sound system in the theater was like hearing it again for the first time. Good movie, great song."
3,pas mal,"Ce film se démarque quand meme de la moyenne Cruise, bien que sans cette bonne OST, le film ne décollerais pas autant surtout qu'il s'agit d'une repompe...néanmoins je suis extremement déu de ne pas retrouver la chanson de Freur ""Doot Doot"" dans ce CD. Mais il semblerait que je ne sois pas le seul à poster ce genre de commentaire... beaucoup de chansons sont passé à la trappe... aux profits des plus vendables. Décevant ! d'autant plus que ce film ce veut Justement ""film musicale""...."
4,First song in the Movie,"In the begining of themovie when Tom Cruise get out of his ferrari in his dream and is running down the street in new york. There is a dance/techno song playing, what is the name of the song and who is it by?? PLease help me. please email me back the answer at ..."
2,Fudge Pie,"I am giving this film a solid two. Two stars. This means that this movie could have been a four and easily a three, had it not comitted some cardinal errors. First of all, the story is too convoluted. There are simply too many 'what ifs', too many 'is this real, or a dream?'. Secondly, this movie is too long. This movie, like so many others, were it cut and edited into half, would be twice as good. Otherwise, the performance by Tom is stellar and the story had some meaning. Although, one really has to wonder what it all really means. The idea of a physically perfect Tom Cruise being suddenly mutilated in a car accident is a great one for a movie. What happens when someone who has it all, suddenly loses what made him so alluring in the first place? A beautifully shot movie which would have been much better served by a script editor."
3,Song In Elevator at End?!,"I'm desperate to find out what the name of the song is that is playing while Cruise and the man are ascending in the elevator at the end of the movie. I know I've heard it before but have no clue what it is. I am NOT referring to the song at the very end, Njosnavelin. Please help."
3,Song on Rooftop at End of Film,"I dont know if hte person that asked this question will ever read this, but I think that the song played at the end of the film on the rooftop is, if I remember correctly, a song by a group called Spiritualized entitled ""Ladies and Gentlemen We're Floating Into Space,"" coming from the album of the same name. . . as for the soundtrack itself, I dont own it, but that is because I have all the good songs on it. Props for putting Radiohead though, espcially ""everything in its right place."""
3,Question,"Does anyone know the name of the techno song that was playing when Tom had the mask on in the Club? If there were more than one, I'm after the one Tom was dancing too(if you haven't seen the move yet,sorry)?"
2,Vanilla Sky,"I have to say that right after I saw the movie... I was in sheer lust to go out and purchase the CD! When I got to the store, and found it... WOW!! What a disappointment it was, there were only 17 of the songs that were played in the movie!I walked away empty handed and felt cheated out of all the magic the music added to a film, so intensely created!I went home and watched the DVD again, ( to also enjoy the music that was missing on the CD.)What happened to the rest of the songs? Will there ever be a full compilation of all the songs that were used in this movie?"
3,Just One Song,"Well, I don't know about the whole CD but there is one song I had to have. The roof music, that haunting beautiful music. I didn't know the lyrics or the name or anything (though I do now thanks to another reviewer, I will buy the CD), so I went and bought the CD and it wasn't on there. I was incredibly disappointed. That's the only one I wanted and it wasn't there. Why? Why were the songs that are included songs that just don't feel right? I agree with everone else, the soundtrack is supposed to tell a story and take you back to the movie. And the songs in the movie just don't feel right. I felt the placing took away from the scene. But the songs themselves are good and entertaining so I will give this 3 1/2"
4,To the March 6 Reviewer,"The name of the techno song that is playing in the very begining of the movie as he is running down the street is named ""From Rushmore With Love"" by Mint Royale. It would have been cool if that song was included on this soundtrack because it is a very good song. Other than that, this soundtrack is very good. It has a good variety of songs that all stick out in their own genre. Overall, I enjoy this soundtrack"
3,where is the best song,"njosnavelin(sigur ros) was not on the soundtrack, could someone please post a review to tell me what bootleg version appears in the movie. thanks"
2,Where's VIKKI CARR?,"To mention a Three time Grammy winner in the movie teasethe audience with a glimpse of Vikki Carr's CD cover andno music...poor taste. I do give Penalope lot of creditfor having Vikki Carr's CD on hand, Penalope,you sure havegreat class including popular music and wishing you much success!"
5,Truly Atmospheric,"Wow. Talk about atmospheric music! Excellent diversity. Awesome usage of FREUR and SIGUR ROS in their respective scenes. If it were up to me to score this film, I would have made very, VERY few changes. Almost a perfect use of music for each scene. I REALLY liked the movie but truly LOVED the soundtrack. This is a great CD to either take a drive to or wash dishes to."
4,Missing song from Times Square scene,"The song from the scene where david was running in times square is ""From Rusholme with Love"" by Mint Royale.Hope that helps!"
4,"Great soundtrack, but missing several key songs",This is the kind of album where you can turn it on and listen to and like every song on it. The only problem is that there are a couple songs from the movie that were left off of the album. Does anyone know what the name of the slow song is that they play in the background in the elevator at the end of the movie when Tom Cruise is remembering his funeral?
3,Help me here,What song from the Beatles do they play in the movie that is not in the soundtrack? I'm really curious to know. Not the one from Paul McCartney. I'm pretty dissapointed that its not on the soundtrack.
4,Aye! This soundtrack needs a sequel!,"An amazing blend of music, but I am in complete agreement with the previous reviewer - too much was left out. For example, two samples of music by the incredibly diverse individuals who were/are the heart of ""Fruer"" and now ""Underworld"", Rick Smith and Karl Hyde, have one song from each incarnation of their bands, yet neither is represented in the ""official"" soundtrack. Very sad. C'mon! ""The Wedding Singer"" had two albums released of soundtrack! An excellent film and great soundtrack such as this deserves as much! Release a sequel, please. Include everything, everything..."
4,pretty damn great.,"There are great moments of blissed out post-rock here..(Sigur Ros, Radiohead) moments of serious grooves..(Looper, Leftfield)..moments of transcendental beauty..(Jeff Buckley, R.E.M., Red House Painters) moments of naive seriousness..(The Monkees, Todd Rundgren) and moments with killer songwriting dudes..(Bob Dylan, Peter Gabriel, Paul McCartney) and some other stuff too including a curiously soothing acoustic ambient post-rock piece by Nancy Wilson of all people. And the Red House Painters song 'Have You Forgotten' isn't the original version from 'Songs For A Blue Guitar', it's a newly recorded slower version, heavy on the effects. This soundtrack has at least something for everybody, literally. I haven't seen the film, you don't really need to either to appreciate this great assortment of songs. If this is like having a Cameron Crowe mix-tape, I can dig it most highly."
4,Love it - even if it is missing the most important song,"I love the soundtrack, but must admit I bought itfor one song, the one where he is on the roof withSophia, and the one that is playing as he falls from the roof.I did find the name of it, though. It is ""Ladies and Gentlemenwe are floating in space"" by Spiritualized. Album with thesame title. I am surprised how much I like the Cameron Diazsong and have fallen in love with the Red House Painters and""Have you Forgotten"". I find I am now obsessed with the Soundtrack as much as the movie.For some reason, that movie has really stayed with me.I pretty much know it word for word now."
2,Deceiving ... but mediocre,"I bought the CD primarly for 2 songs:1) The song playing when David jumps off the building ... which is not DOOT DOOT by Feur, contray to several postings. The song is ""The Nothing Song"" by Sigor Ros.2) The other song I really like is the Radiohead song playing when David is in the bar. That song is called ""I might be wrong"".As for the rest of the album ... as I mentioned, it's mediocre. Pretty misleading considering it didn't have 2 of my favorite songs that were part of the movie."
3,A bit of a let down,"I was expecting more of the actual sound track of the movie included on this album rather than merely a selection of pop ""classics"". Even the pop tunes are fairly mediocre, except Peter Gabriel's ""Solsbury Hill"" and REM's ""Sweetness Follows"", which stand out from the rest. The title track, by Paul McCartney, is not really strong enough a tune to be classed as a memorable movie theme standard. Other tracks, I have either heard before or are not particularly inspiring anyway.The selection by Radiohead, ""Everything in its Right Place"" is more in keeping with what I thought was the sound track, but is all too brief.Tossing in tunes by icons like Bob Dylan, Nancy Wilson, Jeff Buckley, Todd Rundgren- and even the Monkees- seems to me to be more of a marketing hook than creativity.Not a bad collection of mostly vintage pop songs, but that's all you can say about this album."
3,Merely prelude to what it could possibly BE...,"I wanted very much to OWN the Vanilla Sky soundtrack directly after seeing the film. But after seeing that it contains only 17 of the 41 tempting songs placed throughout the movie, I am left disappointed. WHERE IS THE REST OF THIS SOUNDTRACK!? I don't want to buy the 17 songs and lust after the 21 left out of the mix. I want ALL of the songs. I'm thinking this situation needs to be remedied. All in favor of a sequel to this soundtrack..."
2,"Not bad, but very incomplete.","(2 1/2 stars) The thing I hate the most about soundtracks, is the soundtracks that don't have all the songs used in the movie. And this has everyone wondering what this and that song was and where they can buy it since it's not on the soundtrack. This process really sucks. As far as the Vanilla Sky Soundtrack goes it has some good songs on it, but it contains less than half of the songs in the movie.I suggest that you listen to clips of all the songs on this album and make sure that the songs you want and like from the movie are on it BEFORE you buy it."
5,Sigur Ros tune (Njosnavelin - The Nothing Song) Is Available,"The song at the end of the movie when Tom Cruise leaps from the roof is Njosnavelin (The Nothing Song) by Sigur Ros. At the time the movie and soundtrack were released the only version available was a live ""bootleg"" the band allowed Cameron Crowe to use. The song has now been recorded in the studio and is available on Sigur Ros's ""()"" album. None of the tracks have names, but it is the fourth song. The sound/ambience are extremely close to the version in the movie.I know from reading the reviews that a lot of people were looking for this song. Now it's officially available.I'm not sure where the version in the movie came from.....perhaps from the HBO ""Reverb"" special?"
5,beautiful and hypnotic,"Thanks to Corey from Tulsa for the song list.....the one gem missing from CD is ""ladies and gentlmen we are floating is space""...from the group spitritualized...a hypnoticaaly beautiful song from the memorial scene....even with this great song missing this is the FM soundtrack of everybody's dreams over the ageof 32....Thank you Cameron Crowe for your care with compilation.."
4,Vanilla Sky,"""Vanilla Sky"" was a trippy, existential sort of film that I'm having difficulty dislodging from my head--not that I'm trying. The soundtrack replicates the inertia. The mismatching of genres can be a blight on a soundtrack's legitimacy, but it works here because the movie itself wasn't linear or logical by any stretch. The same convoluted, vaguely ominous atmosphere lingers on songs like Wilson's instrumental ""Elevator Beat"", the Red House Painters' wistful tragedy ""Have You Forgotten"" and McCartney's smug title track. There's not a bad entry on the list; Crowe's taste is predictably impeccable...."
5,A dream-like year in film,"Last year there were many films that delved into the dream world (i.e. Mulholland Dr., Waking Life). Vanilla Sky can be added to that list. It is a movie that explores many different topics, and like all movies of this league it is free to interpretation. It means a little something different to each person, that is, if your willing to look closer and think (something our audiences lack to do these days). Although, if you just want to sit back and take the ride, by all means do, but there is something more. The soundtrack is ingenious in its mix of popular, hip and surreal songs. It is extremely fun to listen to. ""Where Do I Begin"" is amazingly cool as well as Peter Gabriel's ""Solsbury Hill"" (a personal favorite). ONE THING I MUST ASK: WHAT IS THE SONG THAT PLAYS IN THE BEGINNING OF THE MOVIE WHERE DAVID (TOM CRUISE) IS RUNNING THROUGH AN EMPTY TIMES SQUARE? ITS NOT IN THE SOUNDTRACK AND I WANT TO KNOW!! PLEASE SOMEBODY TELL ME IN THEIR NEXT REVIEW."
3,Vanilla Sky 2,"Good movie. Good music, but I loved the track that played during the entire party scene. Creeper Lagoon's ""Wreaking Ball"" Of course it is not on the soundtrack. Probably scheduled for Vanilla Sky 2 the give us more money CD. Why leave out the good new stuff?"
4,Missing Song List,"Here is a list of the songs missing from the soundtrack:The Healing Room - Sinead O'ConnorGood Vibrations - Brian WilsonWrecking Ball - Creeper LagoonMy Favorite Things - John ColtraneI Might Be Wrong - RadioheadMy Robot - LooperWild Honey - U2From Rusholme With Love - Mint RoyaleIndra - Thievery CorporationDoot Doot - FreurOne of Us - Joan Osbournenjósnavélin (the nothing song) - Sigur Róságtis byrjun - Sigur RósRez/Cowgirl - UnderworldLadies And Gentlemen We Are Floating In Space - SpiritualizedIf I've missed any, please post those titles for everyone."
5,John Hare strikes again,John Hare is one of the most brilliant ethicists of his generation. His most recent series on ethics and the trinity should prove to be the most influential text on ethics since Kant. Kudos to the Englishman!
4,Great but had some flaws,"Found that the landscapes were not detailed enough and its refresh rate was not quick enough, this was most noticeable when looking at the aircraft from the outside. The crash simulations are not detailed enough either. For the price of the game you would expect more. Along with almost 2GB of HD space required barely warrants this game 4 stars. I'm running a Dell 1.7Ghz with a NVidia Geforce 3 Ti 200 card with 256 RDRAM. So I'm positive its not my PC. Hope this helps."
5,...but I ain't got wings.,"FS 2002 is a serious simulator. That said, this simulator is a real achievement from the folks at Microsoft (like 'em or not). I have gone through most of the training lessons, and I can tell you that they are thorough. I have two friends, who are real pilots (I'm not), that are amazed by the knowledge I've gained without leaving the confines of my study or risking a real-life bad-weather landing. So impressed that they each ran out and purchased a copy.The simulator includes numerous detailed aircraft, thousands of airports, amazing graphics (definitely need a good accelerator and lots of RAM for this), detailed downtowns (I live near Denver and it's spot-on), real-time weather conditions, customizable weather conditions (for practicing your instrument landings), and a ton of lessons that will let you talk-the-talk with real pilots. I've played this one for hours, and I really haven't scratched the surface. If you're even a little interested in flying, buy this game."
5,my review,"Microsoft flight simulator 2002 is the one of the best game i ever tried.Although, the only problems i have with this game is that it takes up too much space on the hard drive. The new planes are great,The atc is even more great and the graphic improvement is also great. Out of 10 i would give this game a 9.5. If you had previous versions of the game like fs98 or fs2000 you will definately see a improvement.I would recommend you have a proccessor like mine or faster for good performance."
3,Not happy - damaged CDs,"The program is a good one. I owned it in 2004 before hurricane Katrina destroyed the CDs. On receuipt of this order that was rated as ""USED-MINT"", I found CDs were scratched and had fingerprints on them. Loaded program and often screen will flicker or jiggle. Have requested a refund."
3,Fun but difficult,"Flight Simulator is a fun game but there are many things that are hard to figure out without reading the manuel. The Air traffic control is difficult but once you get the hang of it it's a very fun and realistic thing. One thing you need to run this game is at least 300 MHZ and windows 98 or higher. Anything lower and the game will lock up. The many selections of Air craft include, B747-400,B737-400,B777-300, as well Sea planes where you can actually land on the water! thats a very fun thing. The game is very good for pilots who need to practice or are learning to fly. They have a flight school taught by a professional pilot, Ron Machado, who teaches you all the basics and as you build up you can earn pilots licenses and lead the life as a pilot. If you willing to spend (the money)and have 300 MHZ and windows 98 and higher and interested in flying aircrafts i would suggest to buy this game it's very fun!"
3,New FS version =>> New computer,"Just like every odd year, I am going to fire my computer and to buy a brand new one ... Heaven knows why ... so Micro$oft does ...My dear ol'chap ""PIII/700"" is going to be promoted as the ""My personal Network's general data backup unit"".Why ? Because obviously FSn+2 won't run on it without driving me crazy ! I hate slide-shows ! WHEN will Micro$oft bring us a clean, brand new and EFFICIENT 3D engine for FS ??? Of course I will be ready to pay a little bit more for it ... if it only could run (yes RUN, not WALK) on my previous computer ...Jacky Brouze"
5,Flight Simulator 2002,I got Flight Simulator 2002 a couple of days back now and i just want to say that i love the game. When I first played on FS2002 i was hooked for hours. The whole game is excellent so i can't possibly choose my best thing on the game. However I did love flying past the World Trade Centre (GOD BLESS AMERICA) and seeing what a beautiful building it truely was. The amazing graphical detail is completly stunning and I love it.From Barry Helmsley (WWF Superstar)
5,Best simulator ever!,"This is the ultimate in simulators. The scenery is so real it is awesome. It also has a very good selection of aircraft from trainer planes to the big 747. I purchased FLY! before the Microsoft 2002 came out and there is NO comparison. My only regret is that the regular version of '2002' came out first. I bought it, then the professional version came to the shelves. The professional version is much better, but Microsoft didn't give us a choice to purchase it first. All-in-all though, it's a winner!"
4,Worth the upgrade,"This version of FS (Flight Simulator) has the look and feel of Combat FS 2, with Civilian aircraft (you do get a corsair). I could go on about all the great features about FS 2002, but if your a fan of Microsoft's flight simulators you'll end up buying this one too, and it is worth it. I really enjoy the computer generated air traffic and the air traffic control. In short if you want as realistic of a flight simulator as you can get on a home PC, this is the one for you."
5,Next generation flight sim,"there is no better, or more experienced flight sim maker than microsoft...if your looking for a great flight sim that is realistic in both graphics and airplane dynamics than this is your flight sim. The only quibbles i have is that they took away the Concorde and that they didnt add the second most popular aircraft in the world, first before the 737, the 727. But those are minor and the 747 more than makes up for them....Enjoy flying!!"
3,"Its Okay,Nothing Great!!","Flight Simulator is in some aspects way better than flight simulator 2000, but it also has its cons.Pros:New Aircrafts with a much more detailed virtual cockpits.The Grand Caravan Amphibian can even land on water.Graphics are excellent.You can plan your departure and arrival airport which makes it easier to travel from one place to another unlike in Flight Simulator 98 and 2000 where the player has no clue where to go.Cons:Needs a very good computer system with a minimum of 32 Mb of Video Texture.Takes ages loading and takes a lot of space on the hard disk.Overall it is a fun game to play and you will cherish every moment of it."
2,This game is unstable!,"Just received Flight Simulator 2002 for Xmas and having a real problem using it. Seems that I get continual ""freezes"" or pauses every few seconds while trying to fly any of the aircraft in the program. This is not only annoying but almost unusable, since it's is hard to make fine adjustments during flight (especially trying to hover the bell helicopter).I would, however, appreciate any help, tips, or suggestionsthat could possibly cure this problem. For reference I am running Windows XP on an 800MHz Athalon CPU, 512Mb of RAM, a brand new G-Force 2 video card with 32Mb of RAM, and a 20 Gb hard drive."
1,Vapor Reviews,Vaporware is how people refer to software that is promised .... but never appears on the shelves on time. Vapor Reviews should be the term used to apply to people that write reviews of software that has not been released. FS2002 won't be available for 'real' reviews for another two months. Don't trust vapor reviews any more than you'd trust vaporware.
5,cool as,this is got to be the coolist came around its like the real hting and my favourite plane is the boeing 747 they are so cool if you dont have this game and you like planes you got to get it i rate this game 100000000000000000000000000 millone stars yheah cooooool aaaaaaaaaaaaasssssssssssfrom Joshua Huntley
5,Tha best game EVER!!!,"This is the best game because it has the best graphices and has the best Jumbo Jet Couverage and it is very realistice.But the price might be to high I don't no I just thought it was a lot for a game , but it was wearth it.Thankes for reading. LaterI LOVE IT"
2,Expected too much,"First of all this software seems to have bugs. The game causes PC to freeze constantly. Can t use the game / am depending on Microsoft's tech support to get the game functioning.(?)However the main issue, after all the enthusiastic previews, I expected much more. Apart from the new ACT communication features, nothing really new in comparison to FS 2000. Still one and the same generic engine sound for the B737/777 and the 747 - sounds like a vacuum cleaner / not like a jet engine! Exactly the same engine noise as heard on FS2000.I have a Computer with Pentium III / 450 Mhz Processor and 128 MB Ram, that s by far not enough power to run a software like this and they should make this clear."
1,Dud CD...,I tried to install it and found that the install CD was pitted badly and it would not install on my PC. Microsoft told me that it would take three months to ship me a replacment install CD! I opted send it back for a refund instead. It took two months to get a refund from Microsoft which did not cover shipping costs that I incured. At this point I am wondering to take a chance and buy another potential piece of junkware from Microsoft or spend it elsewhere; perhaps on games that run on Linux that I boot to instead of Windoze most of the time since being burnt by Microsoft.
4,Real VS.Beta,"Well, I had the chance to fly the Beta version of FS 2002. The best part of it was finaly the WX was very realistic. I put the WX to THSA with with heavy precip. When I did a side view, it looked very real, I thought I was in the BE-99 that I fly in real life. Shooting an app down to mins was like the real thing. I was truly impressed. I found that the airport listing was much better than before& when you wanted to find an airport, you could just use the airport idenifier ie. KBUR KLAX ect. and it took you there. The hold short and taxi lines were a big pluss. The ATC was ok, But I am andvit VATSIM user. I tryed to load up Squawk Box, and it just did not like it at all.I hope it will work when it if finally released.The bad thing was, I did not see ant improvement of the frame rates in flight. And like I said before SQ Box did not work with it. I am sure some good person out there will get it to work for everyone. Excellent job as usal Microsoft :)Cpt. Michael D MaxhamAmeriflight"
5,Blue screen issues,"I had blue screen issues with Flight Simulator 2002, but discovered it was in fact my system which was being overclocked from 800 MHz to over 1 GHz. When I clocked it back (I'm running Windows XP, by the way) FS2002 worked like a charm! No more blue screens or crashes, just beautiful bug-free play.FS2002 is by far the best sim I've ever played, and it's programming is far more efficient, as it can keep a good framerate on a decent machine (Celeron 800) with the graphics turned way up! Thousands of trees and small buildings, very detailed terrain elevations, airports that actually look like airports and function like airports, the ability to download real-time Jeppesen World weather with a winds-aloft feature, the sun reflecting off the water, real-time ATC which works very convincingly and good all-round dynamic scenery AI.I would recommend this to any flight sim enthusiast!"
5,The best sim out there?,"Of course! As usual, Microsoft did agreat job on this sim. Anyone arguing with that simply expects more than a sim, they expect the real thing... well folks it ain't the real thnig (yet...) so content yourselves with hugely improved frame rates (compared to fs2000, on the same system, fs2002 runs at least twice as fast), improved graphics, buildings and trees anywhere in the world, more planes with better design, and fairly realistic atc.The only disappointment is the ATC. As a real pilot, you have a huge library of requests but in fs2k2, you have limitations... maybe microsoft will come out with a patch and improvements. Or maybe an add-on from a company will be released...I still give it a 5-star rating because it uses the best design programs out there. It definitely is ""as real as it gets!""Go get it!"
5,Great,I have this game with a microsoft percision2. I love the game but i found that you gotta have a really powerful comp. i have a 6 gb drive.Flight sim is the only this on it and it takes up 3.5 gb... Some times it takes up so much memery i is multycolored. So you have to have a lots of memery to have it work perfect.i think the aircrafts look awsome and so does the scenery. it's the best for beginners but not the best for advanced.
2,An OK Product,"Ok, I admit Flight Simulator is a great program. I have bought Flight Sim 98, 2000 Pro, and now 2002 Pro. Each program is better than the last, but only slightly. I find the ATC feature sort of cheezy. I expect they will fix this in a hurry though by the next version.The Frame Rate has increased with the new version, which is a delightful surprise. The scenery appears pretty much the same with the exception of randomly appearing and disappearing buildings.The packaging is .... All I got was a box, pamphlet, program, and CD envelope (not even a jewel case). The Quality is no longer there as with previous Microsoft products. If you have (or ever) purchased Microsoft Train Simulator, you'll know what I mean.If you do not own a Microsoft Flight Simulator, I recommend buying it. I don't however, believe [it is] is worth it simply as an ""upgrade"". Stick with Flight Sim 98 or 2000 until they develope an upgrade worth paying for."
5,This Simulator Rocks is the best out there!,"Get this game if you like flying, get lots of downloads have fun!"
5,Microsoft Flight Simulator 2002 Pro,"This is the all time best flight simulator ever available to the public. As a pilot, it helps me train for flights, and recaps some things that I learned in flight school 13 years ago. As a current pilot flying the well-known Boeing 737-300 (like on the sim), I have got to say that it is highly detailed when it comes to the flight deck. It shows all the intruments used in flight, and gives a 180 degree view of the flight deck, as if I was turning my head. If you are interested in aviation, or are just a flight sim maniac, I highly recommend that you purchase this program. Not to mention interactive ATC!"
5,Best MS Flight Sim version ever,"I recently bought an XP 2.0GHz P4 w/256 Ram and loaded FlightSim 2000 thinking I would get great performance. The result was horrible choppiness. After reading some online reviews I bought FlightSim 2002 Pro, started it up, and quickly realized that I had come across the best FlightSim that MS has ever come up with. The scenery looks better than I've ever seen and the frame rates are the best that I've ever gotten. And the new ATC is great. Can't recommend this product highly enough."
1,horrible! DO NOT GET IF YOU HAVE NVIDIA GEFORCE 256 CARD!!!!,my first assumption of this game was 5 stars and i had been looking forward to this game but IF YOU HAVE AN NVIDIA GEFORCE 256 GRAPHICS CARD IT WILL NOT WORK!!! NOR WILL NUMEROUS GAMES FROM MICROSOFT!!!
3,Wedding fever,"Likeable characters and good, although a bit unbelievable, story. Nicely written, but predictable. More formula feeling than the authors more ."
4,"Runs small, colors vary, but good product.","I ordered this for my husband, a size larger due to other reviews, and it is still very tight, but not bad. I ordered Navy blue and it looks royal blue. However, the quality is great and he is happy with it. Fast shipment, best price I found online."
5,Have your Eyes Opened with each turn of a page!,"Insightful! Brilliant! McWilliams displays beautifully the damage non-crimes has on society, the economy and our collective states of mind!"
5,Excellent and thought-provoking!!!,"Any ""Christian"" who advocates putting all the sinners in jail had better read this book first. This is just about my very favorite book, and has helped me greatly in coming to understand that the Bible can be used to justify anything one wants to justify, from genocide to genuinely trying to love one's neighbor. Peter McWilliams has done a truly fantastic job of arguing that serious Christians (or any other person claiming good intentions) will restrain their impulses to punish, and will, instead, practice tolerance. Read this book!!!!"
5,Test your Character and Knowledge!,"Absolutly Amazing! A must read book for everyone. US history,goverment (and frustrations with it), cristian foundations, all of what each of us deal with is explored in it's covers. Read it and share it. But also contact your officials to see if they read it, Peter did the ground work you just need to call or write!!"
5,Fantastic lay person's treatise on law!,This is the best lay person's law book ever. It simply and unmistakeably makes its points. Solid logic that would be hard for the most die-hard critic to oppose.
5,A must read,"A very good book, everyone should read. A little long, but you can skip around to the parts that interest you."
5,Everyone should have a copy,I bought this for my husband and you would be amazed at comments made by people we admire everyday. Everyone should have a copy to see what America SHOULD really be like...
5,If you read one book on the subject...,"Make it this one. This is hands down the best book on the topic. It beautifully (sometimes amusingly) goes over each argument for and against the idea of not just decriminalizing but legalizing consensual crimes.Its a very easy read, with large font and interesting quotes from surprisingly supportive historical figures such as John Adams, Reagan advisors, bush advisors, and George Washington."
1,"And they say, Marxism is a simplification!","I don't have too much to say here. I've read a few 'libertarian' books and always with the same result so far: some trivial things I would agree with but overall, it's stomac cramps for me. Is anyone taking this black-and-white, cardboard-cutout depiction of reality for serious? To me, it's either excrutiatingly stupid, or just as excrutiatinly dishonest. I don't know which, but after reading this book I _know_ I'm no libertarian (whatever this ""libertarian"" label means.) Well, know thyself, so that's good after all, I guess."
5,"""must read"" for every educator, legislator, debater & hater","more than just the title reveals, i learned more about so-called ""Christian"" beliefs, the Bible and ""morality"" from this book than anything else i've ever read (including the Bible itself!) the author has great insight and the true spirit of freedom and liberty. as he hopes, his book should be standard reading for every judge, legislator, attorney, police chief, and religious leader, regardless of their affiliation or political ""party."" i recommend it highly. not an easy read but worth it!"
4,"On my ""must read"" list","A thoughtful response to the laws that make criminal various consenual acts in our culture, why they exist, and challenges us to consider the cost to our country of incarcerating people for non-violent crimes. I picked up the book especially for his well-thought discussions on sex and sex crimes. Sadly, McWilliams lost a battle to use medical marijuana as an anti-nausea drug to balance out the regime of medication he was taking for AIDS and cancer. Despite growing his own marijuana in a state where it was legal to do so, the federal government raided his house, and a federal judge refused to hear his case. Without the marijuana to ease his nausea, McWilliams choked on his own vomit and died in 2000, a victim of the War on Drugs."
4,WONDERFUL!,"This book is full of things that should be explicitly clear to any level-headed person. The premise of the book is that you can't legalize personal morality -- and if an action that one person takes does not hurt the person or property of another, then there is no reason for it to be illegal.McWilliams presents his arguments in a very well written manner. And while I do not agree with every point that he makes, I do most certainly see and respect his point of view. Some of his view are distorted; some are right on target.McWilliams even put together a website where you can read the entire length of the book for free. Just go to mcwilliams.com, then click on the appropriate links. But the book is a must have -- because at the top of every page is a quote -- a quote that is relevant to the subject matter of the surrounding pages. The price of the book is well worth the wealth of quotes that you get."
4,2nd time works again,"The Dickinson brothers and bassist Chris Chew dredge up tons of earth from the riverbank with powerhouse crunching rhythms as they build up a legacy to old blues masters and their roots. Staying more closely in line with traditional blues, the All-Stars sound more like early ZZ Top in the distortion-fractured ""Sugartown,"" but stay at home in the heat of the Delta (""Lord Have Mercy"" and ""Leavin'""). Like Huck Finn's pappy, someone must have had a frightful case of alcohol-induced nightmares to see ""Snakes in my Bushes."" The message of ""Freedom Highway"" stands out for its clarity of purpose and focus, and since these guys are marching for the cause, you'd better check out www.nmallstars.com and www.tonecool.com to see where to catch the bus. Get onboard, y'all, and ride the 51 Highway!"
2,"Less 80s, more blues","Their first album, Shake Hands with Shorty, was badass. This time around, they got away from the rockified blues (and R.L. Burnside) and went more mainstream rock and roll. The only problem for me is that the rock and roll sounds way to 80s glam rock. Example: the laser-beam sound in the background one of the tracks. That's 80s, not blues, and way too cheesey.Recommendation: buy their first album, skip this one."
1,Waste of Money,I ordered based on Belkin's name and the price seemed reasonable. I wanted to split the signal to an older Sony 36 inch tube TV and VCR. But the reception got worst on both units. I only used two of the outputs. I didn't want to use the pass through feature of the television. My granddaughter knows how to play videos and DVDs but will not change the TV to channel 3 to watch videos. I brought a Dynex two unit one at WalMart for $2.99 and got a better signal. Maybe my unit was defective. Buyers beware. I gave it one star because I couldn't submit my review without it.
2,Mighty slim,"I was surprised to see how small this book was - I should have read the fine print! It worked out to around 70 pages, I think. The book is apparently drawn from the author's introduction-to-handguns classroom curriculum and is very light on content. The most informative handgun book I found by far was ""The Concealed Handgun Manual"" by Chris Bird."
2,For beginners only,"This book is intended as a ""minimum requirement reading"" for new gun owners. The book fills the bill adequately, but the problem is that it handles the issues very superficially. The book addresses about all the important issues, but it does not give them the proper treatment.On the other hand, because the book is very thin and fast to read, it more probable that a prospective gun owner has the patience to read through it, and it certainly is better to have read this book than having read no book at all. But the problem is that some persons (who are not into reading, anyway) may think that they have read ""a book about shooting guns"", and think that they don't need to study the subject any more. One has to wish that reading this book gives a beginner an stimulus to study the subject further."
5,Plenty of room,I was looking for a Bible that had room to write notes and thoughts down as I studied. This Bible fit the bill. It is a good tool for those who want to jot down what the Holy Spirit is teaching.
2,Lids could seal better,"The idea behind these plastic lids is great, and for many applications will be fine--but be aware that for thin liquids, you may experience some leakage unless you really crank them down tightly. I bought them for an application where the jars contain a very thin liquid (pure alcohol) and need to be shaken daily. I have to be careful not to shake them too hard, or leave them inverted for even a moment, or they DO leak."
4,They are what they are,"I am using these to cover some Kerr wide-mouth jars... and they do that! The seal appears to be water-tight, as nothing spills when I turn the jar upside down, but I haven't rigorously tested it.It's crazy how expensive some little plastic lids are, though. Makes one yearn for the day that 3D printing is upon us."
5,Exactly What I Was Looking For!,"I have just received my set of 8 caps today and they fit perfectly on the rooster drinking jars I received afew days ago, they will be perfect for my family's use ...we will use them to cover the drinking jars to and from places such as the house to the car to store etc...also for storage in fridge, while outside the covers will come in handy to keep bugs out of drinks and so many other uses.Thanks so much for the quality product and shipping time was also excellent, I paid a bit more than I expected to in shipping cost but the product is coming from Canada and I am in the US so perfectly understandable and I highly recommend shopping this company."
5,How they do it revealed,"I just received this book and have only looked at it briefly, but I was fascinated to see the explanations of how the spiral designs are created. Pretty clever."
3,"Worth it for ""I Gotta Be""","There's only two songs I listen to on this CD. ""I Gotta Be"" and ""Wednesday Lover."" The rest doesn't do anything for me.That being said, I think it is worth the price just for ""I Gotta Be"" which is a classic.This is a good RnB group who always has some fantastic songs on an album, but also they always seem to have filler which doesn't appeal to me on their records too."
4,Another J.E. hit!!!,"Well, I actually forgot how good this CD was good until I popped it into the CD player recently. Jagged Edge have really nice songs and make some excellent slow ballads. J.E. have done well in their past projects and they don't disappoint in this one. Pick it up, you will not be disappointed! YMMV..NEOSOUL"
4,The best songs are..........................,- Slow motion- Addicted to your love- I gotta be- Way you talk- Ready and willing
5,This Gotta be one of the best CD's out,"I didn't until a couple weeks ago realise that these guys were around in 1998. Well when I saw this CD I imediately picked it up. ""I Gotta Be"" is in my mind the best song on this album. Everytime I hear it it makes me think of my girlfriend. I hope someday to have this song be playedat our wedding."
4,There is a smooth side to 'Jagged Edge',"'JE Era' is definitely on the romantic tip and boasts production from super-producer Jermaine Durpi, as well as a few rap cameos. This album shows off the guys' harmonies and writting skills as well. The album features nice slow jams, ""Wednesday Lover"", the Marvin Gaye remake, ""Slow Motion"" and the sleeper hit ""Gotta Be"". It also has a few dance tracks like the hit ""The Way You Talk"" and ""I'll Be There"", featuring rapper Busta Rhymes. The songs do seem to be similar to each other in some ways, but still doesn't stop this album from being platinum-quality work."
5,Wonderful Resource!,"Like all the Usborne books, this book is a great tool for learning. As an elementary teacher, I bought this book just to have as a handy reference. I have also used it with my kids at home, and it is everything I learned in a semester of college art class all rolled up into this handy children's book. With all my experience with Usborne books, I just can't get enough of them. For more information on Usborne books, visit ..."
2,Good directory but should have TESTED the psychics as well!,"Althogh this is a good directory, the author didn't bother to let a period of time go by so she could report on whether or not the psychic's predictions ever actually came to pass! She merely describes their reading style and leaves it to the reader of the book to gamble on which psychic to go to.Paula Roberts, Frank Andrews, and Alexander Mallon were all impressive while Carolyn Clarke and Kathleen Karter were two of the worst and most inaccurate psychics I have ever met."
2,"Good directory, but should have TESTED the psychics also.","Although this is a good directory, it was ludicrous of the author to publish such a book without first waiting at least a year to see if any or all of the psychic's predictions have come true or even close. The author merely describes each person's style of reading, but offers the reader little or usually no feedback about how ACCURATE the reader was, which is crucial for people looking for a good, quality reading. Paula Roberts, Frank Andrews, Faith McInerney, and Alexander Mallon were the most impressive while Carloyn Clarke and Kathleen Karter were among the most dissappointing. One year later and these last two were wrong about everything."
4,very good,"This is the book that introduced me to Arlene Nimark, for that alone I recommend it!-she is a brilliant astrologer."
5,Excellent Information,"I felt compelled to add my review after reading the above. This is an excellent book in terms of information, exact price, and detailed commentary on how the psychics conduct their readings. The listing includes a broad range, from the very well-known (Michael Lutin, Frank Andrews, Madalyn Aslan, Maria Papapetros) to the lesser known, some of which we found to be very good, (Laurie Baum, Patti Canova, Cassandra Saulter). Over the past two years, my husband and I and many of our friends have tried up to twelve of the psychics listed in the book. Without doubt, they were all better than anyone we'd gone to before, but not equally good to each other. Of course, this is not the author's fault. She herself advises to call first. But in terms of a comprehensive listing and description on the psychics currently successful in New York, I have found no better one published. Highly recommended."
5,"The 2 unreleased tracks are super sweet and should've been on ""Plastic Fang""","Wow! The 2 tracks on here that are essentially released as B-sides should've gotten the royal treatment by being released on the album ""Plastic Fang"". I can think of a couple of tracks they could've bumped to make room for ""Maureen"" (which is a big and noisy gem) and ""Alex"" (which is as funky as anything JSBX has cut to date).These guys never disappoint. If you want a taste of them, try out this mini-CD or get ""Plastic Fang"" (by far the most accessible of JSBX's catalog). Then move on from there to uncover the layers of this really original, fun, rockin' band."
3,not a plum of a book,"before i get all the hatemail-ilove this series-but-this one feels contrived and formulaic. her first capture is a total throwaway-not funny just stuck in there-there is virtually no mystery plot to this book at all, just further ramblings about ranger and morelli that are yesterday's news. the only somewhat funny bit is lula's diet-i've wondered how much steam this series had left and i'm sorry to say that it feels like there ain't much gas left in the tank--sorry janet, but this one feels like you're only in it for the money"
3,"Grow up, Stephanie","What can I say that hasn't already been said. I, too, got tired after the first 6 books. Now I keep reading with hopes that it will get better. When will Stephanie's character develop? When will she start to learn from her mistakes? How does she manage to kill a man in the dark when she is deathly afraid of her gun? Why does Rex seem to be the oldest hamster ever?"
2,...,"I was so looking forward to this book, waiting for weeks for it to come out, only to be very disapointed. The best analgoy I can think of is waiting for a big juicy steak and getting a dried out 3 oz. hamberger patty. Ms. Evanavich has created some of the most appealing characters around, but they didn't do anything in this book. Grandma Metzer behaved herself throughout, and Ranger and Morelli got along. Maybe the formula was boring for the author, but I still think there's a lot of miles in old Stephanine. I really hope the next one is a ten."
3,an easy read,"Overall I thought the book was good. Very fast-paced and easy reading. Stephanie still cracks me up with all the drama that comes her way. The only problem I had with the book was the author constantly repeating old facts. I figure if you're a true Plum fan, you will remember all the details. I thought it took away from the storyline instead of adding to it. But if you're anxiously waiting to read the next installment of Stephanie Plum, I do recommend this book. You won't be disappointed."
5,A choice Plum,"Of all the Plum books, I must say that I've enjoyed this one the most. I found myself actually laughing out loud, with tears streaming down my face at some parts. This one's a sure winner!"
2,Disappointed,"I am a very big fan of the Stephanie Plum novels. ""To the Nines"" was very disappointing. It was not funny and exciting as her books in the past have been. In fact, there were parts that were very boring, and I had the feeling that I was missing something. I kept reading and waiting for the real ""Stephanie"" to kick in. Everyone can hardly wait for the next Plum novel, and I think that this book was not given a whole lot of time and thought. I hope the next one is better. I have turned all of my friends and family onto reading these Janet Evanovich novels, and all of them have told me this same thing. I wanted to make sure it was just not me."
1,"Sleazy, Unlikeable Characters","A moderately entertaining plot, but I could not warm up to the characters. Of course the villains were, well, villainous. But the protagonists are sleazy, some of them marginally dysfunctional. Who wants to hang around with people like this, even in one's imagination? Not me. Won't bother to read another of this author's books."
3,This was just okay for me.,"I have't read many of Janet Evanovich's books, so it was hard to judge against her other work. I had read one review that said this book was ""perfect!"". I didn't agree. It was okay."
5,Great book,"This was the best Stephanie plum book yet... hands down my favorite, laugh out loud funny many times in this one"
1,To the Nines was written for a fifth grader,"This book was written in the language of a fifth grader. I felt like I was reading about Jack and Jill. Besides being utterly annoyed with the simplistic story-telling, I found the plot slow and silly."
4,Just plain entertainment.,"I'm reading the series and even though it's easy to see a pattern in the books, it doesn't make it any less entertaining."
4,To The Nines,Too funny for words. Stephanie is up to her usual antics and doesn't let up. Fun read as always. Janet never lets me down.
4,To the Nines,"enjoyed this book .STEPHANIE,RANGER AND LULU MAKE THIS BOOK IN.I HAVE READ MOST OF THE STEPHANIE PLUM BOOKS AND THIS ONE IS ONE OF THE BETTER ONE."
3,Starting to see the recipe ...,"Janet Evanovich definitely knows how to write an entertaining book. She's had me laughing repeatedly out loud in public with Plum books 1 thru 8. However, in 9, the recipe she uses is becoming too clear. And, maybe I'm just a little dense and all of the other Plum readers out there have started to see the recipe by book 3 and just kept reading. I don't know. Anyway, I'm finding it a little tiresome this time around. Although she still has me chuckling in public."
3,Better than Sugarplums but still felt rushed,"I have read and, for the most part, enjoyed all 9 books of the Plum series. I tend to leave out the horror that was Sugarplums simply because I'd like to forget I ever read it. While To the Nines is a vast improvement over that, it still seems to have left me let down. Yes the characters are as wonderful as ever and the dialogue as interesting as ever, but the plot felt rushed. It may be just me but I don't feel that anything was thoroughly explored. The mystery is simple, the plot somewhat contrived, and I don't know, it just felt forced to me. I won't lie and say I didn't enjoy it because of course I did; but if you read this book and then pick up any of the other first 8 books you'll see what I see, something's missing."
5,more madness and mayhem with the irrepressable ms. plum...,"#9 in the series does not stray from the winning formula that includes criminals, crazy family members, comfort eating, cremated cars, complicated love triangle...all of which stephanie plum takes in her jersey girl stride. this bounty hunter's path to apprehend fta's is never straight, but she ploughs on, often to the incredulous amusement of the local police, with questionable assistance from friend and file clerk lula, and an ecclectic crew which occasionally includes her kooky gran. i have laughed out loud at some point during every one of these slightly bizarre, entertaining tales-(which must be read in strong east coast accent)...our heroine is touchingly human, and-let's face it- who would say no to the attention she gets from the two strong men in her life?!"
4,a worthy fix for Stephanie Plum addicts...,"Janet Evanovich cranks out yet another installment of her very successful Stephanie Plum (""bounty hunter chick from Jersey"") series with 'To The Nines'. For those who fear the series has run out of steam and has become, gasp!, boring ... relax. Evanovich continues her comic writing ways and gives the reader what he/she is looking for: laughs and escapism.But what about the story? It is the usual Stephanie Plum nonsense. Murder and mayhem in Trenton. This time Evanovich becomes a bit more topical by throwing in internet stuff (yes, Stephanie Plum surfs the net), and her full-sized ex-prostitute sidekick Lola goes on the Atkins diet. And Evanovich throws in a trip to Vegas for good measure. However some of the enjoyable yet tiresome routines (Grandma's visits to funeral parlors, Stephanie's cars getting blown up) are thankfully absent.Bottom line: not a memorable installment but certainly an enjoyable Stephanie Plum experience. Enjoy."
1,Overdone Re-hash,The gags are becoming more overused and the plots less engaging as we read more and more and more and more. Stephanie needs to learn some new wisecracks and her characters need some new idiosyncrasies if she is to survive.
3,Surprised in this series,"I was surprised to say the least in this 9th installment of the Plum series. I have read the 8 previous ones back to back and stayed spellbound. But this one did not capture my attention without much effort. I was sadly dissapointed that the reviews and description sets the scene in Las Vegas. I don't recall much action going on in the book about Vegas. They arrived and they left. No thrills. It was enjoyable reading about Stephanies sister and the delivery of her baby. Finally! Grandma didn't pull any hijinks at the funeral parlor which was dissapointing. Nothing really mentioned about her at all. It seems the writer may have been pushed by the publisher to crank out another book ASAP as so many veteran writers are forced to do and the readers end up dis-satisfyed with the outcome. However, I will not abandon this series and look forward to more to come."
4,Terrific Summer Reading,"This book was a lot of fun, especially the trip to Las Vegas and Lula's dieting antics. There was a darker side to this novel with the stalker, too, which gave it interest (of course, it was easy to figure out who the main bad guy was, but that didn't ruin the fun of the novel). This one should definitely be on your summer reading list!"
3,Really 2+,"I have read and loved all of Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum books. I was eagerly looking forward to reading her latest. I made sure I alloted the time so I could read it in one day. For some reason, the book could not hold my interest. I had to force myself to get thru each page. There wasn't enough of Grandma, Ranger and Morelli seemed like popup characters, now Joe is here, now he's gone, now it's Ranger, now it's not. I'm not sure what the problem was, but I didn't experience the ""can't put it down"" feeling. And didn't find myself laughing as much if at all like I have with the earlier books. I'm still going to read her books, but I don't think I will be spending the money on hardbacks. I'll just wait for the paperback version or get it from the library."
3,Really Really Good Trash,"When one picks up a Stephanie Plum novel by Ms Evanovich one knows exactly what to expect - fast paced reading, good action, funny (if not quite believable) scenes, eccentric characters and good neighborhood flavor. This fits the bill. There's nothing more and nothing less. It's a good, quick, light read. If I had one major citicism, this one is like all the rest. The stroy line changes, but not much else.Read it for a good laugh and fair mystery. Don't read it if you are looking to be intellectually challenged. This is pure entertainment....a sitcom in the mystery genre."
3,"Unfortunately, I Got It!!","Most of the Stephanie Plum novels I have enjoyed, and I guess I did enjoy this one. Very repetitive from the other 8. But the worst factor for me was......... I had the stalker figured out 1/2 way through the book! I want to be surprised....amazed....I want to gasp at the outcome..... Not so here, Janet I hope you haven't lost your touch."
2,First Time Evanovich Reader,"I had to really keep pushing myself to keep reading. Stephanie is interesting, the characters in the book are kind of interesting. Lula is a bit overplayed, and kinda stereotypical. She only gets away with it, because many of the characters in the book are sterotypes.As far as this being a mystery, well that is where it fails. I figured otu what was going on pretty early. Just way too obvious."
4,"Close, but no cigar","This is a great series and this is a good book but, it's just not up to the standard I've come to expect from Evanovich. It was too short and under developed. Also, the ending was not very climactic. This felt like Visions of Sugar Plums part II. I would recommend it mainly because the characters are so funny they can carry a less than stellar story."
5,The Best of the Series,"Yes we had to wait for To the Nines to come out, but this book is well work the wait.Be prepare to laugh out loud, it is much better than Hard Eight. I can't wait for the next book."
4,Plum dumb!,"At the risk of not writing a 1000 word review, let me just say that I wish the writer would take us further into Ms. Plum's relationship with Ranger. Personally, Ranger, to me, is a lot more exciting and I believe Stephanie thinks so too. Joe is sweet and reliable, but exciting...? No! I haven't completed all the books, but dumb me, I'll keep on reading them. Their funny but frustrating. The plots are predictable and SP is no closer to knowing one end of a bullet from another. She is really a loser and nothing changes about her ineptitude, but oh well... on to #10. Hope it gets better!"
2,BLAND,"I just didn't feel the energy in this book that I have in most of the other ""Plum"" series books. I had the honor of meeting Ms. Evanovich and she says she has a lot more to come. I am a big fan of this series but this book was preditable with every page I turned. Sorry.... I know this is not a popular response."
3,Stephanie Plum,Great read! Like all of her other books I could not put it down! I love my kingle and I love using amazon.com!
4,"still good, fun read.","I really love Janet Evanovich's series but I have to say I was really disappointed with Hard Eight, feeling that it lacked something. Evanovich seems back on track with this book, but it's still missing something that the previous titles had and it seems to be in the character of Stephanie. But I find Lula to be much more enjoyable (she needs her own book!) and there definately wasn't enough Grandma Mazur! However, I read this book in a weekend and it was worth the money spent. It was funny and cute and I think that those fans of the series will not be unhappy."
4,Really fun; great reader,"The woman who read the CD unabridged version of this book was spectacular. She did all the voices just the way they should sound, although I never considered what that might be when I read on paper the other eight books.The plot is minimal, the dopey events max. But Lula is still great and I liked Stephanie even more when she was ""telling"" me the story outloud."
3,"Story is excellent, reader is awful!","Ugh...Lorelai King just doesn't ""do"" Stephanie Plum right! And, what's with that awful rendition of Ranger? Ugh, ugh, ugh. The story is wonderful, but all but ruined by the terrible reading. Please get Debi Mazur back for 10!!! Now, SHE's got Stephanie down pat!"
5,I laughed out loud!!!!,"If you like mystery and wacky screw ball comedy mixed together you must read this series! The characters in Ms. Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series will remind you of your family, only much funnier. We all know or dream about people like this. These books are what life would be like if we all forgot our internal edit buttons. Ranger and Joe are to die for. The Plum family is just too true to life, and if I were a bounty hunter, I'm sure I'd screw up as much as Stephanie.When I read this series - I just can't keep it in - I have to laugh! Out loud!!!!"
5,Hilarious Plum,My husband and I listened to this book on CD while we were traveling and we just kept laughing through the entire story. Stephanie Plum and Lula had us in stitches with their escapades and scrapes. The conflicting emotions regarding Stephanie's relationships with Ranger and Joe Morelli really kept our interest up. We highly recommend this for adult audiences. The language is a little ripe for children.
2,Lamest of the Series,"The Stephanie Plum series gets tired in this latest book - the killer is obvious about mid-stream, and the romance with the cop and the other bounty hunter are warmed-over, same-old, same-old. The cast of characters was charming and funny for the first couple of books, but there's nothing new here. And there's none of the true gripping suspense I found in the first book, with the truly scary psycho killer."
3,Still a good belly laugh but too much repitition,I enjoy the good laughs I received from this novel but it simply rehashes too much of the info from the other novels. There was great potential for delving more into Joe's family or Stephanie & Joe's relationship however it never happens.I admit that I see a good deal of potential for the next novel and I hope that book 10 will develop Stephanie's love life more and give us more meat regarding the residents of the Burg.
5,There's Hope for a Serious Novel Yet,"I enjoyed this for the same reason several reviewers did not - the dark, serious mood that prevailed instead of the slapstick comedy that seems to dominate the other nine novels. This was also a good mystery, the idea of the ""game"" was superb, the action intense, the romance and heat between Stephanie, the cop and Ranger still going strong...I would like to see more along this line. We are sick of the car problems, the nutty grandma and that &@$& hampster. Evanovich excels in the introduction of minor characters that somehow become part of the overall story - witness Ranger and Lula not to mention the cross-dresser and Valerie's man. The plot line was more in line with traditional mysteries and the surprise - that the people were killing each other in a ""game"" - was only a prelude to the horrifying chase through the dark factory. Highly recommended."
1,Stephanie never changes,"If you've read the first few Stephanie Plum novels you need read none of the rest. Janet Evanovich needs to let her character learn from her mistakes and grow! I was excited when I found the ""Plum"" novels and read through them very quickly. They were great. Both funny and fun to read. By number six I was getting worried. Enough wrecked cars. Enough fear of guns. I waited quite a while before picking up To the Nines and doubt that I will bother to read #10. Sorry, Janet. Grow up Stephanie."
3,To The Nines,"This could well be called ""Stephanie and Friends Do Vegas"" the humor seems more forced in this book and most of it is focused on Lulu the reformed whore. Stephanie still...can not make up her mind with whom she is in love and her skills as a bounty hunter seem to be getting worse not better. The earlier books were more fun to read and not so ""raunchy"". Die hard fans will enjoy this, but the uniqueness of an imept bounty hunter is beginning to wear thin."
2,"More substance, and suspense, needed","I'd been hearing what fun Janet Evanovich's mysteries were to read, so I picked up ""To the Nines"" hoping for an enjoyable afternoon. What I got was the literary equivalent of cotton candy -- sweet and not unpleasant, but not nearly enough to make a meal. Stephanie Plum and the two men in her life, Morelli and Ranger, were likable enough, but I didn't really get caught up in their lives and concerns. The novel could have been more tightly plotted, and worst of all, I figured out who the bad guy was well before the end of the novel. When it comes to weirdo characters and over-the-top plot devices, I like Sue Grafton and Carl Hiaasen much better."
3,Time to do some work on this series,"We were excited about the new Stephanie Plum -- hoping to get back to laughing out loud after the Christmas and Romance disasters. There were smiles and Stephanie actually seemed a little more real than in the past. But the plotting was so obvious, this book could not have kept a 10-year-old guessing. Stephanie needs to figure out what to do with Morelli and do it -- or come up with some new tension. And is any one else bothered by the fact that the only African American in the series is the fat ho with the heart of gold and no sense? Even Ranger only hangs out with white guys. What's up with that?"
3,I knew it couldn't last but I still enjoyed it,"The first 8 were so good. Fast, witty, even a little endearing. This last one is a decent read, but not as good as the first ones, for sure. And I do think the Stephanie Plum books should be read in order to really get the most fun out of them. The thing with Ranger and Joe can't be really appreciated, I don't think, unless you are in on it from the beginning. It's just not the same picking up that particular thread in the middle. Another drawback for me is that I can get through one of these books in just a few hours. I wish she'd write something a little more substantial and not let Stephanie move in with Joe.All in all, though, I recommend this Evanovich series. There are some good laugh-out-loud moments in each and every one."
5,A Winner,"TO THE NINES, aptly named, is the ninth in the Stephanie Plum, Trenton's lady bounty hunter, series. Vinnie, her boss, has posted bond on an illegal immigrant who is reported as missing. Stephanie is hot on Singh's trail when bullets start flying. In the past, Plum has built a reputation as the demolisher of vehicles, suddenly she is haunted by bodies instead. Even her protectors are dropping like bowling pins. As pieces of the puzzle unravel, leading Stephanie closer and closer to the conclusion of a deadly game, her very life is in jeopardy. Evanovich writes action packed novels filled with both suspense and humor and TO THE NINES is no exception. Pick up a copy, you won't be disappointed.Beverly J Scott author of ""Righteous Revenge"" and ""Ruth Fever."" Reviewer for Intriguing Authors and Their Books at http://www.funeralassociates.com/authors.htm"
1,Oh God another one!,"Ok, the first 5 or six were funny to read. After a while it is awfully boring. everyone and everything is same. The ditzy Stephanie can't make up her mind, stupid apphenensions going bad, blah blah blah!!!!(I bought these for my daughter; but read a couple of them myself)Anyway, I think it is time to retire Stephanie and do something else."
5,Another one and its packed full of fun,Vinnie's newly publicized visa bond Samuel Singh has turned up missing. He now has two big Indian woman in his office and a bond that expires in a week or two. He sets both Ranger and Steph on the case. Stephanie is up for an adventure. This time she doesn't have car trouble but she puts a dent in the number of able bodied merry men of ranger. The heat is on when Valerie has her baby and Mr. Plum is ready to move out. But Stephanie saves the day giving Kloughn and her sis her apartment since she recently moved in with Joe again. This book is packed with laughs and tons of action. Its one of the best plum novels yet!
1,Grandma Mazur wouldn't be amused by this one.,"I love the Plum series. But like John Grisham, Evanovich seems to be working more from a timetable than true inspiration with this one (i.e., produce one book a year come hell or highwater regardless of the quality).Yes, it still has some of the same qualities that made me read and enjoy the first books in this series. Lula and Grandma Mazur are still hysterical characters. The sexual tension between Stephanie, Ranger and Morelli is still palpable. But this is where the similarity ends. This wasn't Evanovich's best effort. I hope the author can get back to the creative sources she had for previous books. Otherwise, this might be the last Plum book I read for a while."
4,Loved it!,"I have to say that J. Evanovich's novels keep getting funnier and funnier. I laughed out loud at some parts- Lula is hysterical, and the dialogue between Stephanie and Lula is always guaranteed to please. I also love the interplay between her family- great writing.I am, however, a little fed up with the Ranger/Morelli/Stephanie triangle. It seems as if the author is dragging it out a bit. At this point, I am saying- enough already!!Anyway, read it-if you like her previous books, you will love this one."
4,The Funniest Book I've Read in a Long Time,"It took a while, but once I hit the funny parts, I couldn't stop laughing. Now when I think of this book, I'll remember how the characters reminded me of the 3 stooges and the keystone kops."
2,Low brow farce,"This is NOT a comic thriller mystery. It is farce first and foremost with a mystery as a side element--and not an intriguing mystery at that. A waste of time, I'd have to say."
3,Stephanie is getting old!!! ; (,I am a big fan of Stephanie's but I'm seriously disappointed with the latest installment in the series.Stephanie Plum lost her feistiness and it seems like Lula and Connie have more spank than our bounty hunter. I did laugh out loud in several places but overall pace of the story lulled me to sleep. It's OK for summer read but not worth the hardcover expense.
1,Bad Kindle Version,This Kindle version is bad. The words are blurry and difficult to read. Buy the more expensive version of this book.
5,I love Stefanie Plum and all her antics,"I've read all of the books with the exception of the very last book, they are very fun and hilarous books. I love the mystery and the humor tied together, Stefanie Plum has it all, I just love this collection."
5,great summer read,"sitting poolside this a great summer read!!! being a jersey girl i love reading about lulu in spandex and stephanie running in heels...right on!!! makes me want to go ""south jersey"" on someone who messes with my day...bravo janet for creating a light-hearted series capturing east coast humor"
2,OVERBOARD DIALOGUE,"The characters are interesting with human weaknesses and faults. However, abrasive humor dominates this book. The plot is treated like a (necessary evil) vehicle running in the background. The main characters are preoccupied with sex and humorous taunting of each other. All this would be okay if supporting a story line. I had to force myself to finish."
5,good review,"This was my first kindle read book that I bought, I was very pleased with the experience.I look forward to purshasing another book."
5,In the family,"As the illustrator was my cousin, I bought these copies for my 'children'. Even so,it has FUN illustrations for kids of all ages! ( I am 87 years old and still enjoy them!) Diana LinkCats and bats and things like that: And other wonderful things about God's world (Wonder world books) (Wonder world books)"
4,Aviation Buff's Reveiw,"I think This game is okay,IF you have the right components in your computer. To get the most out of this game,you need a good mainboard,sound card, and video card.I have used this game quite a bit,and havesome experience with computers.The graphics are ok, but as I said, youneed to have a fairly good system to run it to it's max simulatingcapability.I have a copy of FlightSim 2004, and will be installing itin the near future. I promise, I'm not trying to sound negative, butif you want to get a good system, get FS2004, and you'll save time and money. =)"
1,Don't buy it,"Got this simulator, and I am unable to make it work. Unless you have an old version of Windows, forget it. It will not work with Vista or Windows 7. One part that does work is the WWII game, but for the price, it is not worth the money."
3,??,"Looks like I got to write just to see the reviews: never owned it, of course, just shopping! Stupid set up, ain't it?forget the stars!"
2,Awesome game,"Beautifully done and a joy to play. (I wanted to give this item 5 stars but Amazon won't let me change it from 2. Go figure.)This game has so much to offer: awe inspiring scenary, take off or land at any airport you can think of - no matter how small, and the new floatplane means you can take off and land anywhere there's water.When I first started playing this game it crashed my system a lot, but it turned out I had a bad memory module. This game really gives your system a workout.The flight instruction is great, except that the manual is filled with annoying (non)humor that makes reading it a real pain. I just want flight instruction! If I want comedy I'll turn on the comedy channel.Overall I give this product two thumbs up!"
4,Great graphics and real time flying,"Flight Simulator 2002 is the best thing to being real. Now if the paint on the outside of the airplane would say the real companies like Delta, Southwest, United and American, that would even better.The best teacher in pilot traning is in here. There are real time graphics. My favorite is Las Vegas, you can see all of the casinos like Luxor, MGM Grand and the one that you see first from the skies... Statosphere. There are real time graphics and airplanes which makes it really good.All airports are here even small ones like military bases and cargo fields that have only 1 a small runways to airports with more than 4 runways like Chicago O'Hare. They pack all this in one box of 3 CD's.One bad thing about this game is the long load times even when you have a great computer... Still long load times. But this does't take the fun out of the game. Great game but it costs an arm and a leg to buy it, I think it is worth it."
4,"Great for ""older"" PCs","I needed a flight simulator as part of helping my grandson get the Aviation merit badge for Boy Scouts. I had a copy of MS Flight Simulator for Windows 95, but it was a little ""cheesy."" I wanted to get an upgraded version, but my PC is pretty old (circa 2005). When I found Flight Simulator 2002 available on Amazon.com, I was pleasantly surprised and ordered it right away. I received the software and loaded it on my PC and I was very pleased with its performance...it's just what I was hoping for."
5,READ THIS ONE!!!,"...BR>THIS GAME IS ONE OF THE MOST REALISTIC THINGS I'VE EVER SEEN, CAN GO TO ALMOST ANY AIRPORT,U CAN PLAY ONLINE WITH OTHER PEOPLE AND IF U R NOT FROM US THEN U CAN GO AND VISIT UR COUNTRY(PRETTYCOOL ISNT IT?) AND THE LEARNING HOW TO FLY STUFF FEATURE ROCKS,U CAN LEARN A LOT OF THINGS LIKE....WELL A LOT OF THINGS AND THE FLIGHT PLANNER IS SWEET,AND THE BEsT THING OF ALL IS THAT IF U ARE ALREADY BORED WITH ALL THE PLANES THAT FS2002 GOT THEN U CAN GO AND LOOK FOR THE ONES U LIKE ONLINE*(FOR THAT GOT TO FS2002,SIMVIATION.COM,I EVEN GOT LIKE 30 PLANES FROM INTERNE. 4REaL U SHOULD BUY THIS ONE EVEN IF UR WAITIN FOR FS:A CENTURYOF FLIGHT OH AND I FORGOT U CAN DOWNLOAD THE REAL WEATHER ONLINE LIKE IF U ARE DEPARTING FROM NEW YORK(SEE DEPARTING,I DIDNT KNOW THAT WORD I LEARNED IT FROM FS2002)THEN U JUST CLICK ON REAL WORLD WEATHER AND THERE U GOT IT ,IF THERE IS RAIN IN NY THEN THERE'S RAIN IN FS2002........................"
5,Based on screenshots,"This is the most realistic simulator out there. They are finaly using satelite photos to do the landscape, very impressive."
3,"Fun, but System Requirements MUST be updated","I had a lot of fun with the realistic graphics, but it takes up so much disk space so it often lagged. It was really slow..When I was switching computers to a Windows XP Home Edition, it crashed the machine, despite it saying that it is compatible with XP. So please, Microsoft, make a public announcement that it isn't compatible.I miss so dearly playing this game. It is just so much fun!"
4,Great Simulator!!!,"This game is GREAT for anyone who loves planes, or has any interest in them, for that matter!! This is by far the BEST simulator game out on the market! I only gave it 4 stars because it does have a few glitches here and there, but it is still a GREAT game! I will say though, it is well worth the money, but, I think you would get a better deal by getting the Professional Edition! So check it out! You won't be sorry!"
4,Game or tool?,"Looking to have a lot of fun? This might not be the program for you. Looking to learn a lot about flying planes? Then this program will be a great tool. The graphics in the game are great, and the game has every single airport you could want to take off from; from your big city airport to the dirt runway behind your cornfield. A lot of attention to detail was put into the program. The program is a great deal for the money it will cost, but if you're looking for a fun game, this might not be it, but it does have a lot of potential. Don't buy this unless you plan on buying a nice joystick."
5,Amazing Scenery,"Wow, If you want simply the best flight simulator or gaming expierience get Micrisoft Flight Simulator 2002 now! Unbeleivable scenery and detailed cockpits and airports make this game legendary . I recomend this game to a young inspiring pilot or too just people who want a jaw dropping gaming expierience."
4,Looks good. Works well.,A nice solid piece. What you would expect. Fits even the largest rolls of thick Bounty paper towels. Holds up nicely to use. Elegant and well-priced.
2,Formulatic R&B and Gospel arrangements,"Believe is plagued with formulatic R&B And Gospel arrangements, predictable Key Changes and progressions, and LESS than moving lyrics. This album does not justly showcase yolanda fullest vocal abilities. And for the person that said that their are a lot of ""undercover"" gospel artists..don't you think this is one? I Think yo yo should secure better songwriters and producers or her talent is just being wasted."
2,Disappointed,"I am so disappointed in this. For those of us who have watched Yolanda Adams from her days back with Thomas Whitfield and seen her progress this such a let down. What is with this watered down gospel from ""crossover"" gospel artist. The most succesful like Kirk Franklin and Fred Hammond don't hide Jesus name behind ""Him"" and ""He"" so as to appeal to the R&B market. To me there are only two outstanding tracks on this...I just pray God that she changes her tack for her next album, and that Karen Clark Sheard does not go the same route on her sophomore album with Electra."
4,STOP HATTIN,I have enjoyed Yolanda's CD. I think that anytime someone is lifting up the name of Jesus through the tools of encouragement in music it is a blessing... If you listen to the lyrics you can find what she is saying in the Word...Keep on keepin on Yolanda...
5,Enjoyed it,I listened to the entire album and found it very inspirational - she is a magnificent singer and recommend everyone hear it.
5,Excellent Album,"Yolanda Adams has out done her self with her new album. Yolanda is very annointed. The album starts with the hit opener ""Never Give Up"" and is smooth sailing from there. I really enjoyed listening to this album and you will also."
5,Great Collector's Edition,"It really does sound rounder and more polished. Note to those complaining about the inlay with no lyrics: take the one from the older edition and stick it behind the new one! That is what I did. Besides, I am willing to bet that 90% of the people who buy this already had the first release."
4,Wonderfully soulful rock and roll,"If you have not had an opportunity to listen to this CD, please do so. While it is out of the usual genre of my music taste, I threw it in the auto one day at the suggestion of a friend. She has that kind of impact on me! A ""Strange Kind of Love"" to be sure.I was pleased, and very much enjoyed the songs, the pace, and the tone of the disc. The first song ""Hallelujah Man"" has a rhythm reminiscent of Steely Dan or Bryan Ferry. I also enjoyed the songs Jocelyn Square, and Shape of Things To Come.Some good music by a band I had never heard of. Enjoy."
4,"If you don't have it, you're missing out","I barely started high school about 10 years ago when I first heard this group on VH-1. I took a chance and bought the cassette. I adored it and, over the years, misplaced the damn thing. This is one of the few albums I REALLY missed. So glad I found it again. Aching lyrics and gorgeous production make this album a thing of beauty. Vocals are incredible too. Brit pop RULES!"
5,Get this one,This is a great CD because of one half being done by Vaughan and DT and the second half with Jimmy Vaughan and Dr. John and The Roomfull of Blues. This is the only good Live CD to get!
4,Great live SRV,"There are some real gems on this live CD. Stevie and brother Jimmie do a fantastic version of ""The Things I Used To Do"" and ""Dirty Pool"" is unreal. Angela Strehli does a cool version of C.O.D. and ""Iced Over"" can only be matched by Albert Collins himself. Don't buy Live Alive 'cause it is not SRV's best live performances. This is the one to buy."
3,Early SRV Live,"Musically speaking, there seemed to be two distinctly different SRV's. There was the classic blues-rocker, & there was the lightning fast, in-your-face ""rockabilly"" guitarist. Much of this set (for instance, ""Scuttle Buttin'"", Testifyin'"", & ""Rude Mood"") falls into the latter category. The more straight blues material in the second half is given a big-band feel due to the five-piece horn section. Personally, I'm not a big fan of horn sections OR rockabilly. As a result, I'd much prefer the straight-ahead blues-rock of LIVE ALIVE. Depends on your personal preference."
3,Good If Not Overwhelming,"Stevie Ray Vaughan is undoubtedly a legendary guitarist. On this live recording as on other recordings, Stevie adds so much color to his magnificent solos. Its a true joy to listen to the many ellaborate bends, use of feedback, and fast picking on the many blues numbers on this release. Some people may criticize Stevie's growl of a voice but truthfully I enjoy his stylings in that department.Unfortunately, most if not all of the songs here are three chord blues. This can be a bit monotonous after a while. The use of the Room Full of Blues Horns on some of the tracks do help a little as a foil most especially on the slow blues tune Dirty Pool. Somehow I wish the horns and Dr John's organ were given a little more time in the spotlight on other tracks.Overall, the effort is good but not quite over the top."
5,Barn-stormin',"SRV and friends play up a storm. Herein are arguably the definitive recorded versions of ""Cold Shot"", ""Pride and Joy"" and ""Things That I Used To Do"". The horns really add warmth to the sound, but Stevie Ray is front and center. Eric Clapton has said he was in awe of Stevie Ray Vaughan for his flow; the way solos just poured out of him, and there are some blazing examples on this recording.Yes, the man was a great guitar play, an absolute master of the form, but something that is rarely mentioned is that his singing was as emotive as his playing. He was in great voice on this night too."
3,Waiting for the better sequel !,"I have a mixed feeling about this book. The theorical part is far too theoratical and based on merily summing up important issues, where the reader more would have learned about about these sum ups, if they where accompanied with graphics or illustrations. But the descriptive analisis of accidents is one of the very best I have ever seen. Very profound details indeed by means of case studies. However I would have rated it 4 stars if more case studies were included."
2,80% of the book is copy and past of NTSB reports,"I was disapointed by this book. The author ideas are very intersting and deserve 5 stars. However, every chapter starts with very few pages of text then continues with a copy/past of NTSB reports. The book has about 500 pages more than 400 arn't original work but just publicly available accident reports."
5,Fascinating,"Great book, not only as a lesson in the philosophies of Native Americans, but also their legends and view of the future. Truly delightful!"
2,poorly designed,"Problems:Battery door didn't fit tight. Pushed hard and it still stuck out as if poorly manufactured. The first day I used the radio, the battery cover fell off somewhere and now the radio is useless unless I wrap rubber bands around the body to keep the batteries from also falling out. Motorola's excellent battery cover on its first Talkabouts misled me when buying the T6250 into thinking this too was well designed. I wouldn't buy another one.It also didn't receive transmissions from other peopled' FSRs. I've had the older Talkabout 250 and the newer T6250 both turned on but only the 250 would receive those transmissions.Don't buy this radio; Motorola discontinued it for some reason and I suspect we've identified two of the reasons.Sure, some of the features are nice. But the flaws make those benefits hard to enjoy."
4,Perfect for my make-up bag,"Perfect mirror for my make-up bag. Great size. It is replacing another mirror that I have had for 4 years. Love it for when my make-up smudges, or I have something in my eye."
1,BORING,"I really tired to like this book, and it is very rare that I don't finish a book I start. I felt like the author really didn't have a lot to write about, so he just filled the book with a lot of information that was needless. If you are looking for a good read to put you to sleep then this is it. Otherwise I wouldn't suggest it."
2,Left me with questions!,As a long time resident of Grand Canyon I have been long interested in the Canyon's most famous murder. I was disappointed in this book and hope that someone does a better job in the future. I found Scott's writing inconsistent --- at times detailed but frequently hurried and shallow. While reading it I felt the author was trying to meet a deadline and was way behind! Frequently details were left out --- his description of exactly where the murder took place on the trail is inexact. I never felt like the author was close to giving me insight into this murder. Apparently the murder was done for financial reasons --- the book contained just a few sentences giving the financial details. More questions!!! Way too much heavy use of quotes from official sources rather than insights by the author or experts.
5,Pathfinder,"I saw this when it first came out in theaters. I know other reviewers have commented on the deaths at the beginning but I didn't find it at all objectionable, and I'm one who always covers my eyes during even mild violence. It's a great story that kept me involved. I think any child by 4th grade would be fascinated by it."
5,Breathtaking Film of a Vanished World,"Quite simply, this is a stunning film, a window into a tribal way of life that has disappeared from Europe. The only film that can compare is Eric Valli's ""Himalaya"" which does for the Tibetans what ""Pathfinder"" does for the Sami.This film needs to be reissued on DVD. It is just too powerful not to be."
5,"The BRILLIANT, original Pathfinder","I saw this film in a theater years ago and was smitten by it. The German Region 2/PAL DVD is even better than the LaserDisc I used to watch. With it, the soundtrack may be switched to English in a pinch, but the original Lapp with subtitles conveys much more.The story is truly epic, yet told in a modest 88 minutes, and it is no wonder the Sami people passed this story down -- much like the Inuit tale of the Fast Runner. The young pathfinder is a true hero, cunning and brave. The film has terror, tragedy and still finds time for humor. It is as close to perfect as a film can be.Buy a used tape if you must, but see this film!"
5,Insights into solving common problems in photographing,"Tom Ang's Dictionary Of Photography And Digital Imaging provides an important guide for students and professionals alike, surveying the basics of image manipulation and digital imaging. A superb reference, it includes definitions of terms and insights into solving common problems in photographing and digital manipulation."
1,Do Not Buy,The movie did not work at all when it was placed in three different dvd players. I would not recommend buying this product
1,Movie Paint yoru wagon,"It can not be viewed in Utah, what's with that. I need to return it or get a copy that works. Very disappointed!"
4,Very Good - not excellent,"This was one of the best musical comedies I have ever seen in my life. That's not that great to say though, considering I have only seen one. Clint Eastwood did pretty good, Lee Marvin did okay, and Jean Seberg was good for a beginner."
1,warning! this region 2 will NOT play on U.S. DVD machines!!!!,"I love love love Paint Your Wagon, and was sorely disappointed when I received this Region 2 version and it wouldn't play on my machines. I had never heard of ""Regions"" for DVD players and it won't play on my computer, either. I think there should be a warning on the title, not just hidden in small print."
1,They sent me an unplayable dvd,"They sent me a dvd playable only in Japan and other countries, when I live in the US, blamed me for getting it wrong and refused to exchange it for one I could play in my country. They would only have me send it back, at my expense, and then they would give me some sort of credit, unspecified even though I asked six times, after they would take off their restocking fee. I recommend no one ever order from this company again and I am now not even sure about Amazon. My advice is to be very careful. I am now going to try to get the dvd I wanted somewhere else."
1,Paint Your Wagon,"Well I haven't seen this movie yet. It is for region 2 and I live in region 1. I am still waiting for a return authorization form from the company I got it from so that I may trade it straight across for a region 1 movie of ""Paint Your Wagon"". It has been over two weeks since I made that request. If you can help me please do."
5,paint your wagon.,"paint your wagon,the film was liverily,very entertaining the costumes wereexcerlent and all the family could enjoy it i have seen this film about 12 times so far its always great if you want cheering up."
4,WONDERFUL SOUND AND PICTURE,"Please ignore the comment about the ""missing credits"" and couple of minutes of music - IT IS NOT A DEFECT!!! IT IS THE ORIGINAL EXIT MUSIC restored to the film! It did not originally have credits with it!The soundtrack is big and booming and very stereophonic - sounds the way I wish other musicals did on DVD - what a fun fun film."
4,classic musical,"This is a classic musical western. It's a bit hokey but if you like Clint Eastwood, westerns or musicals you can get it all here! Good story line too."
1,Watch out of Region 2,"I had no idea what Region 2 was. Well, it's for use in Europe. Why they would send one to someone in the US is beyond me. It should say - ""for use in Europe - not the US."" I didn't bother to send it back as it would have cost almost as much as I paid for it. CK"
1,Wrong Region,"I wanted to watch it, but I ordered the wrong region, therefore i didn't get to watch it. I didn't know that there were different regions to order from"
4,paint your wagon,"paint your wagon is about a classic musical songs like ""they call the wind maria"",""i talk to the trees"". in a mining town where two brawny men who share the wife that the share together."
5,one of the best musicals,I wanted the best quality for my money. I have never been dissatisfied. The movie is a great bargin.
1,Worst Musical of All Times,"This is a perfect example of what went wrong with movie making in the late 1960's. Old Hollywood (cast of thousands, musicals, Technicolor, entertainment on a grand scale) vs. New Hollywood (independent productions, films with a message, up and coming directors and actors who rejected the studio system). The big studios were selling off their assets, being acquired by large mutinational companies, and were totally out of touch with the movie going public. Instead of giving us more films like ""The Graduate"", ""Bonnie & Clyde"", ""Carnal Knowledge"", and ""The Wild Bunch"" they gave us stuff like ""Paint Your Wagon"" and ""Oliver."" Lee Marvin and Clint Eastwood singing and dancing! What braniac came up with this idea? The decline of the musical genre as a viable commercial product can be attributed to this movie. It took 15+ years until the rebirth occurred in animated form with Disney's ""The Little Mermaid."""
3,It just didn't paint my wagon,"I remember when this movie came out. I was a kid. My mom and dad went to see it, thought it was really good, surprised to hear that Clint could sing half decent. Nowadays, the less than respectful treatment of women is a turn off. I'm sure that back in the sixties, this sort of movie was still acceptable, but today it really grated the wrong way with me; i'm sure it would with others. However, there were some bright comedic moments that even i, the feminist prude, could appreciate.I give it a firm three stars for comedy, music, but it's missing two stars for being mysogynistic. ;)"
1,Paint Your Wagon DVD,"This edition does not work ""in our region"" (the USA) which was not presented to us when we bought it as a Christmas presenr for a relative. So we have a $20 purchase that doesn't work here. What a waste. We'll try and track down the seller through Amazon but may not have enough information anymore.Very unhappy with our Amazon experience...This gets a minus rating...not even one star..."
5,Paint Your Wagon,This DVD I received was flawed. I have tried to view it on 3 different DVD players and the picture breaks up every time. I really need to know how to return it.
5,Paint Your Wagon,"This is an excellent movie for simply enjoying, if you like musicals. But, more then that, it is outstanding for teaching what life was like for our 49ers during the gold rush. Students as young as 12 enjoyed this experience."
4,It laid a big fat egg. The last of the genre' of big splashy,"musicals. I liked it a lot. You don't think Lee Marvin & Clint Eastwood actually sang do you? Lively rollicking musical with Marvin shamelessly over acting. Eastwood is a bit understated as his partner. Then there is Jean Seberg & she is just fine. A fairly decent plot too about polygamy in California during the gold rush when women were in short supply. The musical highlight is Harve Presnell singing They Call the Wind Maria. The scenery is spectacular, the music is good, the production values are high. Big stars. What's not to like?"
4,VHS Paint Your Wagon,Over ten years have past since watching this Movie. I was very satisfied with the sound clariety and overal quality of the VHS tapes received in this order. Shipment was timely order processed with out delay.
4,Love it or hate it....,"O.K.....I've been reading all of the reviews here so far, and it's obvious that you will either loooove this movie, or totally despise it. In my opinion, I think it's a fantastic movie. The cinematography is outstanding, and the soundtrack, (when heard in high-fidelity) was CLASSIC late 60's Nelson Riddle. Sure, Marvin and Eastwood were NOT singers, but the movie was MEANT to be rough, and it suceeds, while not failing to entertain. There are a few downfalls that some people will find as turn-off's (the ""I'm married to two guys so screw you"" attitude is one example), but otherwise it is a fairly enjoyable musical romp.Musicals were dying by 1969, but this was a watchable last gasp."
5,one of my favorites,"I've known about this movie since before it started being filmed. Some of the extras I knew. It was also filmed about 2 miles above my grandparents cabin in eastern Oregon. (UP E. Eagle creek). Most of the cast and crew stayed in Baker (now Baker City) Oregon. What still amazes me, every time I watch the ending scenes, is how well they restored the area. Within a short time the only sign that anything had happened there were the signs left stating that the film had been shot on that spot. I still love to get lost watching the film and hearing the music. Thanks for the memories. And a well made film."
1,Pirated Copy,"Ordered a copy of Paint Your Wagon to enjoy while on vacation. When I tried to watch it, it would not work. It appears it is a pirated copy."
2,The movie they tried to ruin,"""Paint Your Wagon"" is almost a textbook case in how to ruin a film version of halfway decent musical. Take a minor Lerner & Lowe hit, blow it up all out of proportion, cast three non-singers for the main leads, and remove most traces of the whimsy and irony that made this moderately popular in the first place. That the result is STILL somewhat entertaining is almost a miracle. A lot of the credit has to go Lee Marvin, who plays his trademark drunken Westerner to the hilt. But Clint Eastwood and Jean Seberg are bland to the point of nonexistence. A standout (he's hard to miss) is Harve Presnell, an actual singer who belts out the movie's big hit, ""They Call the Wind Maria"" then promptly disappears. There's a lot of ""what-in-the-world-were-they-thinking?"" in this one. But it's still worth a couple hours of your time."
2,Don't watch this while eating,"Most people who write reviews I'm sure do so because they had a lovely family experience with the film. Watching Paint Your Wagon alone is about as much fun as counting toothpicks or watching leaves fall. The acting bites, the music is suspciously un-hi fi and the story line is WEAK. All in all, this film deserves any and all butchering it receives. It has survived only because it has become a cult classic. So put it on the shelves next to Rocky Horror or Attack of the Killer Tomatoes and leave it there."
1,Seller not not up front with return policy at time of sale,"The seller did not disclose Region 2 as india/africa location for viewing. Seller did know the item was being shipped to California. In sales there is no reference to regions locations to view product purchased. Had I known that there were specific regions for videos or a graph showing the regions I may not have spent $30.00 plus dollars for a movie I can not view. When I asked to return product, I was notified that if it were returned unopened I could return it. How would I know that if on their return policy at the time of sale, they had not mentioned that. Also how would I know I could not view it if I had not opened it to find out?"
1,I just gotta say...,"I know a lot of you people love this movie, and I accept that. But this movie just isn't my cup of tea. This movie to me is one of the worst ever made. Of course that's my opinion."
1,Boring!,"Eastwood himself admitted that this was a failed effort. 'the studios can make you look like a real fool if they want to.' This is the film that convinced Eastwood to start his own production company. In fact, one movie later, he never worked for anyone else again. This movie is painfully boring. There are only two scenes of him singing that are nice to see, but they are really brief. I need to save innocents from seing this film!"
5,Paint Your Wagon,"Classic movie, classic cast. Loved it! It's side splitting funny and I enjoy it over and over."
5,My absolute favorite,I love this movie have watched it twice in the last couple of weeks. Never get tired of Lee Marvin and Clint Eastwood.
1,Bad Tape,"My wife and I watched the VHS of ""Paint Your Wagon."" The tape was well worn and the second one kept ""chattering"" through most of it. Overall, the quality was very poor. Apparently no one took the time to glance at it before it was sold."
3,Let's Blackmail Clint Eastwood,"His rendition of I Talk to the Trees is so bad it's pure genius comedy. Seems like the blond female lead is lip synching, why not this route for Clint?? Momentary insanity on the set. They Call the Wind Maria, however, is sung by one of the most beautiful voices I have ever heard. Campy, fun show and pretty scenery."
4,Welcome to Hell!!!,"Singing, dancing, mugging, more singing, dancing, catterwalling, fighting, scenic majesty, nuff said, now let's throw our hands up, howl at the moon, dig for gold, smoke a cigar, drink cheap whiskey and fall [face down] in the mud."
5,Very pleased with this gift I purchased.,I was very pleased with my purchased. I was searching for this DVD as a christmas gift for my husband. I received my order in a timely fashion and it was in perfect condition. The cost was very reasonable as well.
2,Disappointing,"Unfortunately, and with all due respect, I believe this book to be unintentionally biased to a fault. Presumably accurate, the book dissects and describes the history and chief tenets of Islam, with its literal inconsistencies and contradictions. This can't be all there is. While the book does help to explain how Islam can inspire violent Islamic extremists, it sadly, and unfortunately, fails to address how Islam succeeds in inspiring the many many more nonviolent faithful."
3,Conned by the Yellow Kid's Memory,"I am a fan of cons and the Yellow Kid was one of the best. ""It was an itch I just had to scratch,"" the kid was alleged to have said in a nursing home as he neared his 100th year. Any information about the kid is hard to come by and I had to have the book and would buy it again. That said, it is poorly organized and a lousy printing with photos that look like they were photocopied from originals. I guess it is only fitting that folks are still being conned in terms of buying the book....but for sheer audacity, Weil was the one but You need to be a true aficionado to pay the steep price for what you get. Otherwise, it's a one star deal. For me it was an itch I had to scratch."
1,BP-FT1 not compatible with DSC-T9,"The DSC-T9 requires ""infoLithium"" battery. The battery will fit in the T9, but upon power-on, camera will display error message and shut down."
1,Inadequate packaging,This wine cooler weighing 103 lbs. comes with very poor protective packing. Our original and one replacement order was delivered with a broken door on both occasions. I can't believe that Amazon would ship this product with only the original manufacturer's packing which is not designed for the rough handling of third party shipping. Amazon refused to send a second replacement after promising that they would do so. It took a second call to Amazon to even find out that the product was not being shipped and that a refund had not been issued. Do not buy this worthwhile product through Amazon unless they promise to adequately repackage it to avoid breakage.
4,Haier Hvf042BBG Wine Cellar,"Product arrived promptly, is nice looking and seems to keep constant temp. Has settings for red or white wine. The lock for the cellar was broken. This is a disappointment, because we have teenagers, but I am not willing to try to ship the thing back to the company to get it fixed. A piece inside the lock appears broken, so not easy to fix. Otherwise good product."
1,BUYER BEWARE OF HAIER!,"AVOID THIS COMPANY!! My unit arrived broken. Haier customer service was rude & obnoxious. They were completely unapologetic & seemed to go out of their way to be UNHELPFUL. When I finally bullied them into action, they wanted a full week to send out a service man who may or may not have been able to fix it. I spoke to both customer service and corporate, both were extremely rude and entirely useless. What's more, neither one had the decency to so much as apologize. NEVER AGAIN.This was every internet buyer's nightmare!"
1,If you could ever deliver it in one piece it would be great.,"If you could ever deliver it in one piece it would be great.Unfortunately, it always arrives damaged.I've had FIVE replacements in all. ALL were damaged and returned."
3,Not what I expected.,"Don't get me wrong, this is a cute little book but I feel that the story goes on a little too long. My son, who has DS, gets bored with the search for Chimpy pretty quickly. The love and affection between father and daughter are very apparant and it's possible that he just prefers ""boy things"" like Russ and the Firehouse. But I felt this book could have been better. The indoor pictures lack spark and have a somewhat dated appearance. I found myself wondering how old the little girl in this story is now, instead of feeling that it was timeless."
4,Bought it for school.,"This book is great to me but my teacher says it's missing alot of information. However it is easy to read, and comprehend."
4,Good book not what I needed,"The book is very helpful, it breaks down terminology better then the book I need for the class. I often use this book instead of the book for the class, even with my homework."
2,Bump free????,"As a black man, I have been in search of a great shave since puberty. I am a big optimist....meaning, I havent given up on this shaver yet. However, I went from using a wahl T-Outliner to shave with(with no bumps) to this, hoping to get a close shave. I ""have"" bumps now and am not sure why. granted my skin is smooth....meaning no stubble, however I now have bumps....go figure. The manual that comes with the shaver states that you may have to give it time for your skin to get accustomed to it......so I'm gonna give it a week or 2 and see what happens. Glad i didnt throw away my old shaver yet. OHHHH, the trimer on the back IS the best thing about the shaver so far....gives sharp lines."
2,"Ow, ow, ow...","This shaver worked okay for about a month. It was never able to get the hair right beneath my nose or under my chin or on my neck, but it did alright on the mustache and around the chin.That said, after about two months it barely cuts at all. It gets caught on hair and painfully rips it out. It glides right over the hairs on my neck like they're not even there, leaving them fully intact.The pop-up tripper is also quite dull. It will just bounce right off of my side burns as if there's no blade at all."
1,Customer Service Sucks,The item I ordered did not include a pop-up trimmer I contacted customer service at DiscountJungle and all they were worried about was the low feedback rating I attached to their site. In addition they agreed to ship me another shaver instead they decided to issue me a credit in the amount of 33.95 however I paid 49.92 for the item. The shaver itself is a nice product I have one from another supplier but DiscountJungle customer service is horrible.This was a Christmas present for a friend now I must shop somewhere else!
2,"""Cheesy"" shaver that doesn't live up to it's name",I've purchased this shaver in the hopes that it would be the shaver I would use for the rest of my life. Unfortunately it does not live up to it's performance. It shaves unevenly and afterward my face is irritated beyond belief. I've owned Wahl products in the past but this has to be the worst. I would not recommend this shaver.
2,A Little Disappointed,"After looking like a wild man for 2 weeks using the Wahl Pro 8061 5-STAR Beard Shaver for Men, I found myself a little dissatisfied the product. I would shave for at least 10 minutes each morning with this loud device to find myself left with lots of noticeable stubble. My Andis trimmers are far better!"
2,FAIR!!!,FAIR!!! or maybe my expectations are/were too high but I need and want a much closer shave. I've used it twice and get nothing that I'm accustom to. I'd like to donate it to someone who would be pleased with not such a close shave.JD - 10/05/03
1,Only lasted 5 months!,"This is an edit to my original review because, after only 5 months this razor is junk! The switch only works intermittently. There is no way to fix the problem. This was my second Wahl razor but, I won't buy another one."
2,Wahl Shaver,"This shaver was not what I expected it to be. The shaver was extremely noisy, and more importantly, it did not cut my facial hair anywhere near as close as my older shaver."
3,my review,I was hoping this product would give me a cleaner shave. It's close but not close enough for me. Gotta clean it more regularly than the instructions indicate.
1,Deceptive Product: Does NOT have a trimmer,"With a name like ""Shaver/Shaper"" one is led to believe that this shaver has a built-in trimmer for shaping. Sadly, the place on the back where the trimmer *was* on older models, has been filled in with a blank piece of plastic."
4,good,i liked it my husband used it on our son and it look good. grate shipping fast. would buy from this seller again.
5,good shave,"I been using the shaver about a month, no more problem with bumps. I recommend this product works just fine."
5,great tool,"i am not a barber, but wanted something for quick clean ups when i couldnt reach my own barber. Easy to clean & close shave."
4,5 Star Trimmer,Great product. I bought it used. It was in mint condition as stated. It gives a very close shave. I'm not able to use it everyday because after several days it can irritate but every 2-3 days has not been a problem. Overall this is a good product. I would give it a 4 out of 5.
2,Used item being passed as new,"My barber first introduced this item to me so my expectations were over the top! Imagine the impact when the same item receive did not meet the standard!Confused about the product I took it to my barber to ensure I purchase the right item. He too was amazed how the seller passed this items off as new when the blades had run its course and badly worn! There were finger-prints on the inside of what suppose to be a sealed package. Immediately, I sent the item back to the seller who has yet to refund the amount paid for a new product!I'm walking away a very disappointed customer.....blah blah blah!"
2,Disappointed,I'm a blk male and my Norelco does a better job at shaving short hairs. This product does a poor job at giving you a clean shave.
2,No Shortcut,"I purchased these shaver/shapers based on my barbers recommendation. The hair on my face is curly, and course. If I didn't use this device every day, or so, the hair would curl and prove too unruly for the device to catch them. (I think the device is better suited for straight hair.) Moreover, I think it goes back to the adage: there is no shortcut when it comes to a close, clean shave."
5,close shave,"I selected this product because my barber had used it when shaving me. I was never satisfied with other shavers that I had previously used because they always left visible hairs, but found this shaver to be very satisfactory. I decided to try it for those shaves that I would need in between my trips to the barber. It does the job very well. I would recommend it to others, particularly Black men. I've had no post shave bumps or other irritation from using this device."
3,Kinda ok,"I tried this shaver and it was ok. I got burned the first time and it did not cut as close as i would like it to....but i think what might not work for me will work for you. For all those black men out there who are plagued with razor bumps and have tried everyway of shaving, here is a little advice: try the Andis outliner 2 trimmer and be sure you go to your local black barber and ask him to adjust the blades. Please be sure that the ones that he uses on his clients work. You want them to be close but not close enough to bite. besides that DO NOT USE RAZORS OR ANY OTHER ELECTRIC SHAVERS. Trust me. I have tried different ways and this will save you a lot of razor bumps."
1,This razor is not what I expected.,I was disappointed with this razor. I read all of the reviews BEFORE I purchased and could not wait to get my hands on it.it would not give me a close shave. I had to go back to my razor blade. I would not recommend this product
1,Wahl Shaver,"Shave a piece of junk. Broke after two weeks it fell apart and I read some of the reviews that claimed that very thing, but my husband wanted to try it and thought just maybe that person had gotten a lemon."
5,Shaver,I bought this for my son for xmas.He was very pleased with this item. Wahl has great products. Price was reasonable.
4,My son loves it!,I bought this as a gift for my 19 yr old son. He LOVES it. He's stopped using a razor and only uses this now. It gives him a nice clean shave without the razor bumps.
3,Doesn't work as well as expected,"This shaver worked well upon first use. However, after the very first use, my husband doesn't get the results that we expected. This shaver barely clears stubble left behind by the trimmer."
3,Close but sore,"This Wahl does give a close shave, but greatly irritated my skin and left my face burning. I tried it a number of times but always had the same result thus I couldn't continue using it. I gave it to my son and it did the same to him. I have used a Braun for many years and never had this problem. I then bought a Braun to replace this Wahl."
1,Garbage,"The foil broke on the second day of use. When I went to replace the foil, the plastic garbage tabs broke off as well. I sold this POS and bought a Braun Series 7. Couldn't be happier now."
5,A Great Shaver for Black Men,This shaver really works well for any man who suffers from Shaving bumps. I have used this shaver for 2 months and I don't have any shaving bumps! It's Great!
5,Christmas present,I wasn't sure about the performance of this shaver. It was a gift to my son. My son was extremely pleased. It shaved just as it said it would. Fast shipping. Would buy from this company again. Thank you!
4,Yes yes yes,I am in African American male without a full beard but when my stubble does grow its curly and patches and it looks terrible and is itchy.wanted to find something that I can use to keep my face smooth and keep my partial beard shaved without using a straight razor.definitely recommend giving this product at least 2 weeks to get the correct shave. I usually use my andis outliners to shave my facial hair down and then follow up with applying remington face saver then the electric shaver.
5,Excellent Clipper,"This is a great and easy to use clipper. I have had no problems out of it, and it gives you the razor look."
2,dissapointed,my husband doesn't like the results from the shaver.he is going to try the wahl triple head one.price ishowever is comparable to other shavers.
2,"Sorry, not happy.","Wahl Professional 8061 5-star Series Deluxe Rechargeable Shaver ShaperAfter several uses of this product I was not happy with my results. Did not get the close shave I was looking for. Hopeing to get similar results, as I uses to from my Remington shaver design for black man's. Also sorry to say Remington does'nt make this shaver anymore. I'm not very happy with Remington on that note too. Just not happy with this Wahl shaver."
3,decent not great,its not bad and a decent value for the price/does not have a trimer and gives a reasonable shave/i would try an other wahl type.
2,The Remington ES 1000 is far Superior,"I purchased the Wahl 5 star shaver and it is lighter, louder, and does not shave as close. I will be so happy when Remington replaces the es 1000 which they discountinued. I will have to suffer with the Wahl until I find a replacement."
2,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,I used this product once on my head after using clippers. I wanted a better way to cut my hair short other than using a razor. I only got one use out of it and now it doesn't even trim short or long hair. If I could take it back I would. I expected atleast a couple months worth of use.
4,Rate product,So far so good ! Ordering items from iPad has been difficult especially because amazons website makes it very difficult to order 1 item
1,Does not work as advertised,The shaver did not cut my husaband's beard. The product is advertised as a bump free shaver for African American skin. Not so.
5,Highly Recommended!,"I am an African-American male and I have had problems with ingrown hairs while shaving with other electric shavers, razors, and magic shave. Although noisy, this electric shaver provides a close shave with little irritation and only a few evident ingrown hairs. I highly recommend this electric shaver to anyone who has problem with ingrown hairs and wants a clean, close shave. I just received this shaver so only time will indicate the durability of the product."
2,Damaged Item,"When purchasing an item, it is expected that I would receive an item in brand new conditon. I received the product within the estimated delivery time. However, when i opened the item the gold foil that covers the blades was ripped, which is obviously not usable. Also, there was a crack in the bottom of the item."
1,Foil split in a week,After just 3 uses the foil split in two. I thought this shaver would do the job and the price was not as bad as some local beauty stores. It does NOT give a close shave either. Have to say this was a waste. With I had a zero star option
3,Fragile and costly.,"I have had this shaver for a couple months, but have not been able to use it longer than a week at a time without having to replace the foil which keeps tearing and scratching my head up. The replacement foils are from $15-$20 each time I replace."
1,Not the Bang for the buck.,"Hey I have to say after reading some of the reviews I was looking forward to getting this and getting off the razor blades I was using now that I'm keeping a shaved head too.After reading the review from the guy going to barber school using it day in and day out, I was sold! But once I got it, not so much. First couple of use were great but after thatit has become harder and harder to get a smooth finish. I find it hard to believe that I have to purchase another blade head this soon! I'm to the point that I still have to go back tomy razor to get close and smooth. This would not be the one I talk up, sorry!"
1,Not bump freee,This caused numerous bumps on my husband.It is not bump free. I would not buy it againand want to return it.
4,Rasor,"This is great, but the foils came apart the first time it was used. He called Wahl and they are suppose to be sending new foils, but so far have to received."
1,Disappointed in Wahl shaver,"Because we have been happy with another Wahl device, a hair trimmer named ""Peanut,"" when I had a difficult time finding a reliable foil shaver (Boy! When you review shavers here, it looks like there are a lot of unhappy users!), I tried this Wahl Pro 8061 5-STAR Beard Shaver For Men. I used it for less than two weeks and the foil split. I do not recommend this shaver at all. In addition, the packaging the vendor shipped the shaver in was very inadequate. The shaver was so loose in the package that the shipping process caused the shaver to actually break out of the clamshell packaging. When I opened the box, the shaver was just sitting loose in the box."
4,Amos Easton,"Popular and prolific, Bumble Bee Slim parlayed a familiar but rudimentary style into one of the earliest flowerings of the Chicago style. Contemporary with Scrapper Blackwell an Leroy Carr. In the 30s one of the most-recorded bluesmen of the decade. The only fault in this Essential series is the lack of recording dates and poor liner notes, but music is good pre-war acoustic country- and early Chicago blues."
4,Great Book for the locals,"Breaking Blue was especially interesting to me, probably mainly because I am from the Inland Empire and because I'm now 87 and lived in the era in which the book takes place. The fraudulant practices that were so blatantly displayed by author Timothy Eden were well known to my parents at the time. Those from Spokane and vicinity will really enjoy knowing how bad the police behaved during a period when the whole country was suffering from the depression. How good it was to find that a detective thirty years later opened the case and solved a crime of murder, although the unusual circumstances prevented prosecution."
3,BREAKING BLUE,"BOOK WAs interesting and well written. The author developed the characters well and integrated them nicely in this rather woeful tale of past and present and how they came together in this woeful tale of life in a desolate , depression trodden logging and mining town. Was a good read."
5,Haunting history,"Great story of determination and survival in a very real world. The story is haunting in it's telling of an event that took a lot of people ignoring moral teachings and justifying in-action to allow a code of conduct to fester for decades. Every person is very real and most human in Egan's tale and the human condition speaks load and clear to the reader in Egan's narrative. It's a wonderful, haunting read."
5,Breaking Blue,"I live near Spokane, it was very interesting to read so much of it's history and a murder mystery to boot. Well written you won't go wrong with this author."
3,breaking blue,"I found this book to be interesting but covered much of the same material in his later book ""the worst hard time"" which was much better. The writing style was a little choppy. In his later books he really develops his writing style and this book shows a new writer who is struggling to develop a cohesive and streamlined plot. The subject matter is fascinating and worth a look."
3,mistakes happen,"I got the wrong book but got an almost instant refund, reordered the book (slightly different version) and received it quickly. Original book was not in stock as it turned out. Company was courteous and prompt even in the mistake. After a career in USAF, mistakes are simply part of life."
5,great for the layperson or those who are familiar with outsourcing,Great for those new to outsourcing or for knowledgable viewers who want to analyze the economic and emotional impact of the phenomenon. I will use it for my high school students and as a resource for corporate professionals whom I train.
4,A Window Into Weirdness,"Infinite Jest is one of those once in a lifetime reads that was simultaneously painfully aggravating and indescribably delicious. It took so much effort and concentration to read certain parts that I could feel the sweat popping out on my brow. To make matters worse, I could only figure out portions of the book, even after a couple of reads.This study guide goes a long way toward answering lots of questions I had about the story, the plot, the characters, and how they interrelated. This was such a big help to me that immediately after finishing the study guide I started reading Infinite Jest yet again, only this time a lot more of it clicked, and made it so much more enjoyable. I only wish the guide had revealed more, but I suppose there's something sort of magical about not being able to figure the whole book out. It would be lots of fun to have more of these guides for great works of fiction!"
1,Not a lot of useful info,"Part I, Acquiring Your Horse, includes chapters on the giveaway horse, the low-priced horse, horse sharing, and horse leasing. Part II, Keeping Your Horse, includes chapters on the backyard horse, pasture keeping, boarding, and working for board. Part III, Maintaining Your Horse, includes chapters on health care, shoeing, feeding & bedding, tack & equipment, and insurance. 'Acquiring Your Horse' is mainly useful for first-time buyers and beginners.Overall this book is pretty general. Unless you're brand new to horses, don't bother."
3,Not Money Saving At All,"I honestly think the author takes thriftiness a bit too far. It's really not a good idea to care for your horse's hooves yourself. If you can't pay thirty dollars every other month, what would happen if your horse had a serious injury that needed urgent attention from a vet?I would say the only thing good about this book is horse buying section; the information there is fairly helpful. Of course that section has it's down falls too- it says most racetracks have FREE retired racehorses. But you usually have to pay an adoption fee for a retired racehorse. Also, this book is clearly designed for the novice pleasure rider, and that is probably the worst person to adopt a young, green, and hard to handle TB."
1,This book is a joke,I can't imagine why this book is getting such good reviews (who's giving them I wonder). I found most of the author's suggestions naive and many of the others obvious. I don't not think that this book provides much practical information.
3,I think that the book is a little bit expensive!,I was planing on getting this book for my sister who adores horses! I do not have that much money though. If yall could lower the price I think it would be alot better! That is my opinion though.
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"This book isn't good at all. If I could it wouldn't get any stars, it doesn't deserve even one! All the things that the author suggests you could think of by yourself. Like looking for a cheap horse. Take my advice please, if your trying to buy a horse, but can't afford it, put the $10 you could be wasting on this book into your horse fund. THIS BOOK WAS HORRIBLE!!!!"
5,Excellent source of info,"I have been thinking about buying a horse for a long time but it always seemed impossible because of the cost. This book brought up so many ideas that I never even considered. It really means ""low-cost""."
5,Your dream of owning a horse can come true!,This is a great book for those who don't think they can afford their own horse. The author provides very useful information regarding all aspects of owning your own horse affordably. The author includes some great money saving tips. I am so thankful to have found and read this book!!!
3,Decent entry level book,"This is a nice basic book for those who dreamed of a horse, but always thought that the only alternative was a full board barn with all the works. The book provides some simple cost cutting ideas, but as mentioned before, comes with some common sense.The main thing is that readers think of this as a starting point and become smart enough to know where to cut costs and where not to! It's easy to fall in the trap of ""everything has to be cheap"". Sorry, people, you're going to have to bite the bullet on somethings in the name of safety and wellness.This book is only be beginning. Anyone serious about making the leap to horse ownership should seriously bone up on as much first aid, horsecare, nutrition books they can get their hands on in addition to this book. Try to get a job as a groom or volunteer for an equine rescue - this will help you learn more about preventative horsecare and emergency care - until the vet comes. This practical knowledge will save you a lot of money."
5,Always been a fan,"I have followed MM's music since his first album and have always been a fan. He continues to grow as an artist and it shows. All 3 cds are great! Just like the previous reviewer, it's great feel good music. Even though the second cd (Thump) has more heart-ache songs, you can't help but enjoy everything this man has released. I have been fortunate enough to see him play live. Once on the first tour in a parking lot at a mall in Houston and second in San Antonio about 2-3 years ago and exchanged emails. He is a sweet guy who is very humble about himself and his music. If you have an opportunity to purchase a cd of his, I guarantee, you will not be disappointed. If you like po/rock, Rick Springfield, hint of Def Leppard, and feel good music, you will be satisfied."
4,"Talented artists, never made the pop scene","Michael Morales is very talented, but for whatever reason never made it big in the pop scene. Classic 80s styling. Probably safe to say a one hit wonder, unfortunate as that may be."
4,Pretty good...but not the best,"Don't get me wrong - this is a great game but it's missing alot of things that I expected. Also having to save the game before you start and after you finish is a pain! Great graphics though. For a cd-rom game I would expect the announccers to be able to say more things instead of ""he's madder than a nest of hornets"" every time a batter strikes out."
4,EA Triple Play getting better,Triple Play 2001 is alot better than the previous games. I enjoy the legends of the game and the Home Run Challenge. I wish that they would have the dynasty part on this game like they do in the football games that EA Sports puts out. I also don't like the fact of having to wait until the end of the game to be able to collect the rewards. Keep up the good work EA.
4,Not a big improvment from 2000,"Overall this game was ok, but i would like to see a few things change. I won 14-0 on Pro mode. Like last year this game is not challenging. MLB 2001 i have heard is very challenging; i will check that title out. I like the Extreme HomeRun challenge only setback is it takes a while and is hard to win. I also think the announcing is terrible. Same as last year you hear the same catch phrases as last year. The game is fun with fair graphics and a few new fun modes. Otehrwise its nothihng to get excited about."
3,Triple Play 2001,This game is much better than last years.I feel that last year's game sucked and was cheaply done.One of the few things I hate about this year's game is you must have a memory card to play a game in season play which sucks if you do not have one.I also do not like the way this game portrays the throws of the players.I do like the Major League Baseball Challenge because it adds something to the game.However I feel that it lacks the realism of games like All-Star Baseball.
4,Another great EA sports game,"If you love the Triple Play series you will want this game. If, however, you love the gameplay of TP 2000 but are not impressed with the old time players, the 500 home club feature, and a tournament with teams of the world, then save your money. It plays exactly like TP2K. No different. Which is good, because TP2K is great.They should have called this Triple Play 2000: Second Edition with added features. Its still a great game, but I just wish we got the dynasty features that EA's football games give us. For really in depth baseball check out High Heat, but for gameplay Triple Play is the way to go."
4,Baseball fan,"EA Sports makes the best baseball game in the business. However, the game still suffers from some fundamental problems. The designers seem too concerned with graphics and ""rewards"" and lose sight of what should be the prime focus of the game: baseball. Still no past balls and no injuries. Instead, you can earn the ability to play with mini-teams or watch players argue with umpires (which seems totally unnecessary).Still, it is the best baseball game I've seen and control over pitching/batting is great. I recommend the game."
2,A Disappointing Game,"This game has to be one of the worst baseball games on the PlayStation. For one thing the game gets stuck A LOT. As for home runs, it's got an emphasis on those. I like hitting home runs, but not when they're obviously exaggerated. The gameplay is often lame, as a player is halfway toward home, but then he runs back to third, on both teams that happens sometimes! I do not recommend this game very much."
2,A hello ?,"Not a good game at all. Please I don't need to smack a home run everytime at bat! Not for a true fan, but if your into the arcade end of sports games, then check it out."
2,CPU Let-down,"Unfortunately, I do not have fellow gamers to play against so I am forced to play the computer as an opponent. One would think that with all of the realistic game-play and other options that this would be a sweet deal, well it isn't. The CPU is very unrealistic in its ability to play, it is easily mastered and becomes very unchallenging long before the All-Star break. This happens no matter what level of play you select or what kind of strategy you unleash. I played 40 or so games into the season and now my game just sits, collecting dust. I have bought my last EA Sports game no matter how enticing the synopsis or the graphic's snapshots on the back of the package may be."
1,Awful!,"There are a few good things, but overall it's a very bad game. I like the addition of legends like Cy Young. Also the graphics are good but nothing fantastic. The worst part of the game is baserunning. There's only one button for either sending a runner forward or back, so you get with situations where runners end up going to the same base and there is nothing you can do about it. This is very annoying. Also, before every game you play, you have to save the game (which takes a while), then after the game it has to load. It's a bad game!"
4,"Pretty good game, but still kinda sucks.","The best part is that you can ""earn"" legends such as Babe Ruth, Gehrig, Aaron, Mays, Satchel Paige, Cy Young, etc. Other than that, there isn't anything special. HEY ELECTRONIC ARTS, HOW ABOUT SOME ""ALL TIME"" TEAMS?"
4,Pretty good game,"This is a really good game,it has better graphics then 2000,but the gameplay is not,2001 feels like your playing the game on Nintendo,but besides that,please get this game if your a baseball fan."
5,triple play 2001,it is great when it comes out it will have everything from past heroes to facial looks and to great gameplay so that is y i gave it a 5
3,Best Baseball for Playstation but....,"The action in this game is fast. It is a fun game overall with lots of nice added game play modes like a home run derby with targets to strike outside the park, and a legends mode where you can play with all time baseball greats like Hank Aaron or Babe Ruth for example. The main drawback to this game though is the pure lack of realism. It just feels outdated when you play it. There is no Playstation baseball title that beats it, trust me I have played them all, but if you have a Nintendo 64 try All Star Baseball 2001 instead. All Star Baseball for the N64 is much more realisic with far better graphics and gameplay. If playstation is all you got though, try Tripple Play 2001."
4,going back for earlier stuff,"I bought this disc after already owning their latest 2 releases, because I was curious about their earlier stuff. It is less polished, but not any less exciting. they are a great band...refreshing and unique...check them out!"
4,I never paid attention!,"I have not really listened to Fat Joe before This album. I heard it in my friends truck on the way home from work and I was like ""I GOT TO GET THIS!"" My favorite songs are ""King of N.Y."",because I like Buju Banton. ""Opposites Attract"" and ""Definition of A Don"" are hot exspecially with Remy Martin. That girl is lyrically inclined! I noticed that on the ""Ante Up remix"", by M.O.P. But my favorite is ""Fight Club"" this song just gets me amped and I don't even like Petey Pablo, his album was trash! But this is worth listening to, Fo Sho!"
2,How Did This Crap Go Platinum?,"It really shows that the late Big Pun had no part in this album, it sucked i wasted my money thinking that J.O.S.E would be like Don Cartagena. Fat Joe put Latinos to shame with this garbage."
2,Hmmmm.....,I'm not really sure what to think of Fat Joe. He's an okay rapper but his voice can get annoying at times. The guests on this album are good and compliment Joe's talent but I still wouldn't recommend it to anyone who wants to have a decent hip hop collection. And after that little stunt he pulled in Cancun (rapping on stage with his shirt off) I can't listen to any of his songs without imagining that event. If you want to listen to some really good white rappers stick with Eminem or Cypress Hill instead.
1,Wally Could Never Envy (J.O.S.E.),"Rappers like Fat Joe are the reason I don't listen to any of today's ganster rap. It seems like the popular thing to rap about these days is self praise for being rich and being an MTV big shot. Lyrics that are all about being mister powerful ganster do nothing at all for me. The King of New York! Why?Because he is another rapper who just became a part of the disposible flavor of MTV and Radio for this month or so?In my opinion ever scence Biggie Smalls and 2-Pac died. Ever scence Public Enemy and The Beastie Boys went thier own ways.Hip-Hop has taken a fall. I mostly listen to Hard Rock/Metal of all kinds, but I am sure big rap fans can do better than Fat Joe and most of days most popular rappers."
1,A FAT JOKE!!!,"How could a person be proud of being fat and disguisting?Thats like being proud of being an idiot.This is one of the worst albums of all time.Most of the songs are sampled and the lyrics are the same old gangster nonsense.There are no good songs on the entire album.The album title should of been called ""Fat People Should Not Make Music""(F.P.S.N.M.M)DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE!!!"
4,Solid album!!,"I'm not Fat Joe's big fan...As a matter of fact I've only listened two of his albuns, I guess it was ""Joe Cartagena"" and thet Terror Squad. To be honest none of them impressed me much. But after reading some reviews posted here I decide to listen the samples...I gotta tell you, I like it...It's a trully hardcore NYC street style of rap...Hard beats, tight rhymes, altough there r too many guest artists, they mantain the vibe troughout the whole CD. I've got to give proops to Joe Cracker this time, this album is really a BANGA!!!!"
2,this sucks,"f*** fat joe he is a f***** and a fat a** b**** this cd sucks do NOT buy it, this guy needs to get better, this is one of the worst cds ever. I only gave it 2 f***ing stars because the track What's Love? is o.k. not too good f*** this cd is sucks"
1,Whoes Jealous Of What?,"I picked up this CD becuase it had Murder Incs Ja Rule. I will never, repeat, never amke the same mistake again. He trys to come off as Ja Rule in the old days, real thug gangsta rap. He just a joke. A fat joke. His songs are too pop and he covers up his lack of skill by swearing. Usually when you pick up a CD and you hate, there are soem tracks you like, unfortunately Fat Joe doesn't do that. Because I never listen to it and ruins my colection of decent rap CDs I threw it out.Happy rapping, without Fat Joe"
5,D.J. Company has the rhythm,"I first saw D.J. Company a couple of years back at WBLI's Summer Jam concert here on Long Island several months before the release of their album. From that moment on I knew this was one CD I had to buy. It's not very you get such a solid bunch of dance jams on one album. From the #1 hit ""Rhythm of Love"" to the upbeat party starter of ""Hey Everybody"", D.J. Company takes command of the dance floor and doesn't let go. I only hope they don't fade into the distance like most dance groups tend to do."
4,Supergrass Junior,"When I lived in Los Angeles a decade ago, I was really into this band Apache Dancers. Imagine, if you will, and Franco-American combo, with a young Hank Williams, with a sidekick of Edith Piaf. This band did exist. In a time of John Doe & Exene, and nothing has been done since? Minimal Compact? Ten years pass, and finally we have a new dynamic female-male duo called Lodger. With a lot of camp, burlesque, and range, Lodger becomes so many things. On certain numbers they could be Roxy Music on their best day, or a Pulp, and other times, only themselves. Pearl Lowe is a wonderful singer, especially on the closer ""Safe."" Neil Carlill is very expressive when he sings on ""This Girl's In Love With Me"" and ""Love is The Game."" Danny from Supergrass also plays drums in this band."
3,"GREAT PICTURES, SLANTED NARRATIVE",Excellent pictures and decent read but Hodges clearly dislikes the duetto spider.
4,Alfazioso,"I red this book, very nice!I am author of Alfazioso, I am very happy that my book has been very appreciated in europe! I hope that the U.S Alfa's enthusiasts will be happy to read it. Arrivederci"
4,Stay in touch...the cheap way,"I bought 2 of these units, with 4 more backordered. This has been a great unit for staying in contact while shopping, hiking, driving, etc. The kids love it, and the belt attachment makes it easy to hook on a handbag strap, belt, etc.The difficulty I have with it is with the VOX mode. You have to make a sound before it activates. If you don't, you lose the first few words before it kicks in.I have the nicad, rechargeable unit. I like it because it saves on battery purchases.All in all, I would recommend this unit."
3,Academic Book,"This book is helpful in providing a guide to writing about Chemistry. Some content feels very obvious and logical, but it is helpful nonetheless."
2,The first 5-6 reviews here are obvious hoaxes ...,"... come on, you can tell that the reviews are written by the author or the publisher or friends thereof.This book is pretty much a hastily put together collection of stuff you can find in the Yellow Pages or boring informational websites. Waste of money."
1,Useless,"You have to be totally out of this country and dumb to find enything interesting in that book. No street map included. Better read a telephone book, more information and much interesting, and it may be free."
5,Ultimate Sashiko,great book but no longer in print and hard to find. I use it for a reference when doing sashiko on quilts and wall hangings.
2,Uninspiring.,"I have seen some amazing Sashiko work illustrated, but not in this book. Not particularily inspiring here---- not ""Ultimate""."
4,The Ultimate Sashiko Sourcebook,"The author covers every aspect of Sashiko embroidery and quilting. The history of the art chapter is excellent, the illustrations are quite helpful and the instructions are clear and complete. In the past my search for learning about this art has resulted in the unfortunate purchase of several books dedicated to machine sashiko. My interest lies in the traditional art and this book treats every area of that ancient craft. I recommend this book to those seeking to learn and discover the exquisite art of Sashiko embroidery."
4,A Great MINNEAPOLIS Band,"Their quirky early sytle was certainly not for everyone, and all but forgotten now, but for about a decade or so, particularilly in the Twin Cities, but also touring through out the Mid-West, the Suburns could do no wrong. This is one of their last albums and actually was accessable enough to garner air play on WXRT in Chicago in the mid-1980's. RATTLE MY BONES is a fun cut. There is a mix of wonderfully complex and full recordings of ballads and uptempo trax with beautiful orchestration by the band. LOVE IS THE LAW, the title Track, has a catchy synth-horn intro that drives the track.Known for their legendary and lenghthy live shows, the Suburns never gyped their audience in concert. This studio record finds them at their best, IMO, capturing the stage energy in a very listenable atmosphere.Gone but not forgotten, MUSIC FOR BOYS, indeed.The All Music Guide deams this the album to own by the 'Burbs, rating it a full 4.5 (out of 5 stars)."
5,A Must Have,"This album was my favorite when I was probably 5 years old. I always made my Dad listen to it. I found it on vinyl recently and gave it a listen. I remembered every song! It is one of the albums that you can listen to every song without skipping any. Very solid, and personally my favorite of all of their albums."
3,Burbalicious.....,"I have to say that I have always enjoyed this CD....however, it was a big bummer coming off of one of the truly greatest rock CD's of the 21st century - Credit in Heaven - by the 'burbs.This CD was the beginning of the end for the boys...It was a major label, and I can remember them backstage one day bragging to me that the producer for REO Speedwagon (or something like that) was doing this album.Thus -- only three stars. PS - I still think you will like this album...and always remember to tape your wife to the ceiling."
4,Addictive,"Sottotono are not only the quintessential Italian hip hop group, they are also a perfect example of the international influence of American hip hop. This album has some really banging tracks, most notably ""Mai Piu,"" although there is one throwaway track with an English chorus that I think was included mainly to be released as an international single. But, other than that, so good."

2,Easiest way to design ..... NOT!,"I am just about to return this application. The printed guide is only a few pages long and of little help and the cd tutorial sucks. I got this product to make a floor plan for a remodeling. I have some CAD experience with electronic layouts and I spent 2 hours on this thing and couldn't figure out how to use any time-saving short cuts or handy tools. I would have spent the same amount of time drawing by hand.This may be a great program once you learn how to use it, however, its not ""The Fastest, Easiest Way to Design!""."
