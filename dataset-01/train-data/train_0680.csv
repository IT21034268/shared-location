5,When mass hysteria counts for something,"JAKOB THE LIAR lets you know when mass hysteria counts for something. See this movie, but not for historical content. See it to feel the power of hope. As you watch, don't sob, don't wish that prayer had done a better job. Hang in there tight for the first fifteen minutes of the film while the director builds the character of Jakob Heym, menteur. Then, watch while Jakob ostensibly tunes into a radio full of ridiculous war news which he passes on mendaciously as the truth. I doubt that any actor except Robin Williams could have pulled this off. It has a remarkable scene with Williams telling the Ghetto denizens about the army tanks that have just came off the boat from Chicago. It has a more remarkable scene of Williams tuning in the radio for a orphan waif who actually believes that her remarks are heard by Churchill. The humor is on the cynical side. The comedy is on the hope side. Want to listen to honest dialogue? See this movie."
1,Read the book instead,"I originally read the novel (of which I assume most of the other reviewers are unaware) and watched the earlier German film of the same name for a college course entitled ""Memory and Mourning in Post-War Germany.""I'd just like to point out that the film is a horrible depiction of the novel. It seems that the director wanted to make a more ""Hollywood"" version of the film, and I think he succeeded. For instance, the entire ending is completely different from that of the novel, and in my opinion is completely wrong for the story.In general, the film has little to do with any of the original versions, and is far inferior."
1,Very Bad Movie,"By far, not one of Robin Williams best. Very, very poor attempt to dramatize one man's hardship during the holocost. You are forever wondering what is this movie about. You realize it at the end and wonder, is that it??? Its about a liar. Why does he lie, that's the story in itself. It a definite yawner."
1,Jacob The Liar,"Bought Jakob The Liar because am a fan of Robin Williams, actors will make a bad movie every now and then, this is one."
3,Over simplified and watered down,"I have to give credit where credit is due; the film does have an inspiring message of hope and Robin Williams as well as Hannah Taylor-Gordon do a beautiful job in their roles.However, this is a very, very, very idealized Hollywood version of the Holocaust.While the film does give us glimpses of fear and suffering, it is mostly a overly simplified depiction of life in the ghetto and life under Nazi persecution.I don't think the film should be completely brushed off as garbage though; I can see it being a useful tool for parents or educators who are starting to expose children/preteens to the Holocaust. Due to the watered down nature of the film, it wouldn't be overwhelming for a younger audience. It should not, however, be the limit of their exposure as there are many more effective films."
1,Self-indulgent!,"Any Burning Man experience from any year thus far has way more to offer than these guys ever considered bringing to the camera.It seemed like most of the movie was the filmmakers interviewing themselves about Burning Man. All of that pointless crap should have been cut out of the movie! (Or, maybe just kept in this version for their mothers, who may never tire of their cute little faces.)""Burning Man Festival-Special Edition"" by Joe Winston is a serious look at the real thing, and far more enjoyable."
5,Journey to the Flames,I loved this and have bought the other movies Doug Jacobson has done! I think this is the best movie about Burning Man that I have seen and I would recommend it to anyone who has or has not been to Burning Man. The director has a way of making the viewer feel that he or she is taking the journey with everyone in the cast. This movie has inspired me to go and see for myself! What an interesting and artful movie. Tony Ghiselli
3,A Lengthy Problem,The description for this product is inadequate. The cord length in particular is completely left out. Why? This is basic information that any buyer should have in order to make a good decision. Generally there should be more complete information on many of the products.
2,Deceiving picture,Picture is deceiving. You receive only the plug. The cable should not be shown! Plug was fine once I purchased and installed it on a cable.
3,great pads and shims...no brake hardware as advertised,Have not installed these pads yet....and they look great....but your add said that they would be shipped with all hardware which they were not...no brake hardware
1,tricky -- hidden Christian,"This book promotes Christianity, but this is not mentioned in the book's description. Deceitful."
5,Best Cooper Kid book yet !,This was a great book! It was very exiting. I could not put it down . It was also a nailbiter
4,"decency from the villagers, not the rulers","Myrdal strives to capture the human drama of village life. And since he is writing in the wake of the Great Leap Forward, we might expect an emphasis on grassroots politics. But I suspect the realities Myrdal describes are mostly older than any modern revolution. The casual approach to parenting, the neighborly approach to law enforcement, the grinding work and poverty, the women's desires for freedom -- all probably reflect realities little changed by the government in Beijing. The decency of these people comes from themselves, not from their rulers.--author of A Galaxy of Immortal Women: The Yin Side of Chinese Civilization"
2,Review,The book is very interesting for someone who is fascinated with the history and culture of bhutan but the first few chapters are very complicated to read. The author goes into too much detail and there are many whord written in bhutantese. Nonetheless there are beuatiful pictures of the king and the countryside. The pictures are worth the whole book.
1,Rainbows and Lies - Book of Lies,"I guess if what ever you do to improve this life's existance doesn't help you in the next, then this story book is a book of fiction that will not add to the authors' advancement in subsequent incarnations. If what you do harms the life of others in this life and impeads the ability of others to avoid suffering and causes hatred of oneself due to selfishness and greed, then this book is a self indictment by the lies told in it."
4,light read,"I have read several books about Queen Victorias life and this periodthis was a lighter one then normal , an easy read and skimmed a bit but very enjoyable it felt more like fiction then fact"
1,wrong product,"I bought the Moen 7445 to replace my old Moen 7445. But the new one is changed from the old one, so I couldn't use it. The design has been changed, but the product description doesn't say that. I had to send it back. It doesn't mount the same way, and the hose hookups are changed. And of course I lost money because of the shipping costs and the restocking fee."
5,Great Book,This book is great! It was just what I needed and truly is a good book to own if you are trying to learn keyboarding or typing...
5,THE Book For Beginners,"As the title says, No Experience Required. I tried several AutoCAD books including the""Dummies"" series and it seems they all assume that the reader has some basic knowledge of AutoCAD. Frey assumes nothing and teaches by example, which to me is the best way to learn. Start with this book, learn a chapter a day, and in a couple of weeks you'll have a good working knowledge of AutoCAD. Then you can pick up some of the other books and go from there."
5,ACAD,Ordered this for my significant other and it was a great gift. We used it already and recommend it to others.
5,AWESOME BABY!!!!!!!,"This cd rocks! i love as long as you love me, but everytime i close my eyes is sooo cool! i like the other songs too, but i already knew them!"
5,Changing Our World: True Stories of Women Engineers,"This book is great. So many examples of all the fun, exciting, lucrative, collaborative, flexible, creative things you can do as an engineer.I bought the book ""used"" and it looked like new. Plan to pass it along to a young woman after reading."
5,Why Not,"I don't know why I never reviewed this before, but just because I see I didn't I will make a comment. This was the best camera I ever owned, and I have had many as well as having a digital slr. It is one reason why I place Panasonic as one of the camera models to look at before making a new camera purchase, and actually bought the FZ20 to replace this FZ10. I have since moved on to other cameras but fondly remember the FZ10. I have not had a camera that has given better results than the Panasonic FZ10 or FZ20."
1,Great camera when it works but 13 months later it does'nt,"My wife got this camera for me when they were relased in 12/03 for my Christmas presant. I was very sick at the time with a Galbladder infection and lose of patassium. It was March before I felt like useing the camera. It worked great and was everything I was wanting in a camera. The first big usage of this was on vacation. All otoaled I have taken 1300 pixs with this unit. I got up on the 21st of this Feb to us it to post a knife on eBay I turned on the camera and hear a strange grinding sound, as I tried to focus I could not get it to in manual or auto and it has nt worrked since. My wife paid almost $600 for this unit. When I call the Panasonic help line they tell me that unfortuinately it will have to be sent in for repair and is no longer covered under warrnety. spend a little extra and buy a cannon!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Original Tyger,"Some points of interest. The title track is the original mix featured on some box sets. Striped back instruments, lower key vocal. Also Alchemy of the Heart fades in instead of the immediate start on the re-release."
4,"tangerine dream, in poetry.","Controversial for its inclusion of lyrics in most pieces and dismissed by critics as pretentious, Tyger is, notwithstanding, an important album. The tone colors are sensitively selected, as are the notes--Alchemy of the Heart, an instrumental piece, defines the album in 12 minutes as eloquently as a thousands words in appraisal."
3,Good melody but poorly engineered vocals,"Those of you who like Tangerine Dream's other recordings, may be disappointed in this one. After all, Tangerine Dream is known for its synthesizer instrumentals, and that's what most people expect from it.True, the songs are melodic and beautiful, especially Alchemy of the Heart (which many praise as the best song on the album, which it is), but the three vocal tracks, Tyger, London and Smile are ruined by the poorly engineered vocals. They're off tune and too loud, and should have been compressed better. In many places, the singer's mouth was too close to the mike.I don't know much about sound engineering, but I get bad vibes every time I hear the vocal tracks. But for the sake of the Alchemy of the Heart, I bought this album."
4,Very happy with these,"I had a holistic doctor prescribe these for me. I initially purchased them through her office, but I prefer the convenience of getting them through Amazon. They are inexpensive, the pills are small and taste fine, and for me they last a long time. I have to say that they don't make me feel much different, but I'm taking them as part of a hormone balancing regimen, and they have a purpose in reducing some possible ill-effects from other things. I think they're a good option for folks like me who are taking a hands-on approach to managing some of the problems that modern society imposes on us, most notably stress and such."
1,Unresponsive Company,"I ordered the wrong product by mistake, mea culpa. From there it was very downhill. I returned the product to the company (IOS out of Cheyenne, Wyoming) with a letter asking for a refund, willing to pay a restock fee, willing to purchase the correct product. No response at all. No contact information to contact the company, so I e-mailed them twice, no response. It took a letter to my credit card company contesting the purchase to get any response, and even then, I had to provide proof that I returned the product - a copy of the letter accompanying the returned product, together with the post office receipt showing that I mailed it - to get ANY response. By then, it was a month later. Finally I was advised by my credit card company that I was being reimbursed for the cost of the product. By the way, the product itself is GREAT. It has saved me from all hot flashes, and I was having between 20-30 per day!"
1,My wife uses these.,I personally think they are a waste of money. But every now and again she reorders them. She has used them for more than 10 years. The seller was excellent with the service. Not to worry in that regard.
3,Waiting for something to happen.....,"I'm 53 and still getting my period which was never a horrible experience but it has been lately so I'm hoping this will ease the cramps and body aches a bit. I haven't been taking them long enough to make a difference yet, I guess. Maybe it will bring on the onset of menopause - who knows?"
3,1362 pages of junk,"This book is a very hard mathematics book to learn from. I'm sure it would be a good reference because it covers a broad range of topics in its more than 1300 pages, but it doesn't cover them well, in my opinion. Examples are few and lack enough detail to follow and extend the content. I highly discourage any instructor to use this book for an engineering math class. There are much better options out there."
4,A usable cooking resource...,"As a very novice home food preparer, I found this book easy to read and not overwhelming with complicated recipes. Recently I tried one of the recipes for tempura bananas desert and found a mistake in the batter mixture. It was simple to fix during preparation, and the desert came out fantastic! Highly recommend this for a novice!"
2,Beautiful Book but not very Useful,"This is a very pretty book to leaf through and have on the shelf. Unfortunately, many of the ingredients are not to be found unless you live in a big city with the appropriate ethnic population/neighborhood. I passed it on as a gift to someone I love who lives in New York City."
2,Ingredients to obscure for small town livin',"Recipes all sound and look delicious, but almost all of them requires a hard-to-find ingredient (lotus root) or spice. I live in a small, blue collar town in Ohio and our local ""chain"" grocery store barely knows what tofu is."
1,A waste of money,"I purchased one of these through Amazon.com from ANTonline. It is supposed to be compatible with most home and office telephones with modular handset cords. I have four such telephones. I tried the device on each of these phones and got either a buzz, a normal sound with no improvement, or no sound at all. I emailed ANTonline in order to return the item, and the company did offer me a refund if I returned it within ten days. However, considering that I would have to pay not only the original shipping price but the return shipping price--and considering that the amplifier cost only $10.75 to begin with--I decided to take the loss. A big disappointment."
2,Great film- bad print,"What could have been an incredibly beautiful movie has been sabotaged by an inexecusably bad transfer (from an original that probably wasn't all that great to begin with). An imaginative combination of live action, vintage engravings and animation, but the print is so bad it's practically unwatchable. So actually, 5 stars for the movie itself, 1 star for the quality."
4,Fabulous World of Jules Verne,"This is a charming film perfect for young people and for people of all ages who like fantacy and inventive film making. Filmed on a budget a fraction of today's movies this film uses models, illustrations, and photo composition to create the effect of animation that looks like the wonderful engraved illustrations in the classic publications of Jules Verne's novels. My family loved it's ""steam punk"" quality and innocent capture of the age of early sicience and engineering. Don't expect slick, but expect charm and delight."
5,YES! THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST TRANCE CD'S OUT THERE,"Weirdo is a prodigy! I have at least a hundred trance, house & drum n' bass cd's and I've gotta say this is one of the best. He mixes thumping anthems all his own. It makes you wanna get up and DANCE! DANCE! DANCE!"
4,stuffed with more than food,"This book had a lot of heart and was stuffed with so much more than food, recipes, and stories about the restaurant. Patricia Volk writes lovingly and insightfully about her family -- I so enjoyed this. See the penultimate chapter's closing thoughts for a great piece about family."
3,An Uninspiring Telling of a Mediocre Story,"Patricia Volk's story is uninspiring.I listened to this book while painting chairs in my garage. It was perfect for that. If someone came in and interrupted, I did not need to pause the book. So what if I missed a paragraph or two? It was mere ramblings of Volk's life. Absolutely nothing earth shattering, no real drama, and the telling of it was mediocre, mundane.It was sort of like having a chatterbox ramble on keeping me company while I painted so as not to get bored.I have no problem reading about a pretty sedate life, if, IF the telling of it is excellent. I loved Blood, Bones and Butter by Gabrielle Hamilton also about a gal in the restaurant world. Hamilton is a fantastic writer. Not Volk.Really this book is not worth your time."
2,Weak and Disappointing,"Thought this would be like 'A Year In Provence' or some of the other books by great cooks, travelers and livers of life. Instead, it is a meandering collection of reminisces of a Jewish family in New York City. There is almost nothing about food and cooking, and what there is doesn't satisfy at all. There is also a lot of mundane and even disgusting stuff about dress and illness and jewelry and gossip and such. If your life is like this, you might like it. But if you are looking for good writing about interesting people making the world a better place with fine food, look elsewhere.Not recommended."
4,Great food-related memoir,"Since I've recently read Kitchen Confidential and Tender at the Bone, I thought I'd continue the food-related-memoir theme.But I'd say this book was less about life in the kitchen and more about life in a family, albeit an atypical one.Favorite part: ""What she (her mom) wants for me is an even cleaner, thinner, happier life than she has. Mom made me and now she will make me better."""
5,One degree of separation,"So much of ""Stuffed"" was familiar to me that from the beginning I couldn't believe I didn't know this family, nor, when growing up near NYC and staying with my grandparents at 19 E 88th St, that I never visited the restaurant! I don't remember my family as being nearly as fascinating as Patricia's, but was absolutely delighted when I read that she went to the same camp as I did and also attended the same dancing school. I'm sure she's quite a bit younger than I, but her recollections awakened so many of my own that I could hardly put the book down. If you don't like anecdotal writing, then this isn't the book for you, but the piecemeal approach, coupled with a keen eye (and voracious memory), fitfully paced, made me feel right at home. Loved it!"
5,Stuffed is DELICIOUS,"I have consumed ""Stuffed"" so greedily that I read the entire thing in one day--it was a binge of wonderful reading. Every single page was filled with the kind of language I love best: people, nuance, food, relationships, history, and a sense of place.It's like sitting with someone in my own family and looking at scrapbooks and photo albums. I keep hearing, ""Tell us again! Tell us again!"" as I turn the pages.I love this book. I read passage after passage out loud to my husband--there are so many little nuggets of information and entertainment. Patricia Volk is a wonder. Oh, what a sweet book, and what inspiring writing."
4,A sweet love letter to an amazingly colorful family!,"I really enjoyed Stuffed. I have to admit that I originally wanted because I am a foodie, and I was hoping that it would be a book about food and how the family dealt with their restaurant. It did have a little about that, but the main premise of the book is talking about most of the members of her family (including aunts, uncles, grandparents), and how they contributed to the world and to the person she is today.Patricia Volk is a wonderful writer, and she made me want to sit down and have dinner with she and her family. A wonderful love story. Her family must be so proud."
1,Need a sorbet to cleanse my palate,"If you are into self-indulgent narcissism, this is the book for you. I'm only half way through, and I already feel nauseous from being force-fed one family's over the top ego. There isn't a chapter where I didn't say to myself ""yuck"". I'm only finishing the book to try to better understand the person who recommended this book as a wonderful read."
3,Video Game Based Movies,Most video game based movies are bombs and this one stands out above some of the ones that cames before it. Mark Darascos is a great martial-artist and this film gives just a taste of what he can do.
3,Double Dragon Review,"This movie isn't as bad as people say it is. I found some of the phrases annoying in it, but the overall script was decent. The major charactors were well acted. The constant looking at each other and screaming got annoying. The Lee brothers were well acted, although I wouldn't have guess Scott Wolf as a martial arts fighter. Alyssa Milano was just plan hot. The movie was ok I recommend you see this movie."
1,Bill & Ted's excellent krate adventure 1/10 part 2 on standard DVD reviews,Ok where shall I begin if you can't follow the source material then you better have a good story well for Double Dragon it shouldn't be hard to do 1 of the brothers girlfriends is kidnapped you go & kick some @** & save her. What did they do they had bad story about a powerful madallion & Robert Patrick looking like Vanilla Ice 1 half of it he plays Koga Shuko. The other half is in possession of Satouri played by Julia Soul who I liked in Rambo 1st Blood pt. 2 she us the adoptive mother of of Jimmy Lee played by Mark Dacascos & Billy Lee played by Scott Wolf. So when Satouri is killed by Shuko Jimmy & Billy seek out the help of a girl named Marion who leads a gang that cleans up the streets she is played by Alyssa Milano. George Hamiltion Vanna White & that untalented sack of s**t Andy Dick (the d!* part is right) make special appearances as themselves as news reporters & weathermen. Overall the movie is the worst ever made
2,a good plot with a not-so-good outcome,"Double Dragon certainly had great potential but failed to keep up the hype. Any double dragon fan will want to see this film but I am not one who compares movies to the video games they are based on (to a degree). I think the majority of people who view Double Dragon most likely won't want to see it a second time due to the climax of the movie becoming a bit cheezy. Robert Patrick has done better roles but he does make for a good villain as seen in Die Hard 2, Terminator 2, and the Faculty."
1,Double Dragon movie review part 2 part 1 is on Double Dragon uncut DVD 1/10,Continuing This is 1 of the the worst movies ever made bad fight scenes bad plot bad chase scenes bad dialog bad 1 liners & bad f*****g acting. You know the film was 95 minutes that gave the movie 15-20 minutes of build up to Marion being kidnapped then 75-80 minutes of guns explosions & martial arts greatness. Honestly if Billy & Jimmy were played by Keanu Reeves & Scott Wolf I couldn't have seen a difference. So don't even download it go rent or buy Double Impact with Jean Clude Van Damme. Or go buy or rent Showdown in Little Tokyo.
1,NO good,This movie was very boring. It had terrible acting. I was excited to watch it for the first time cz I loved the cartoon show but the movie messed everything up.
1,This movie is trash.,I wish that I could give this movie no stars at all. Double Dragon is undoubtitly the worst movie I have ever seen. This is the first movie I really despice. It is badly acted and badly scripted. It is rotten to the core.
1,Kiddie Movie,"OK, what's the words? ""Stay away from this movie"". It failed in a complete translation from the video game. The video game series was much better and much more hardcore and more realistic fighting. Fist of all, if you are going to cast a member from Party of 5 in a so called `action' movie, then you as a producer or casting person better fire yourself forever. Not retire, fire yourself. There is little martial arts for me and my fellow martial arts fans to even try to enjoy. Mark Dacascos is such a talented martial artist and this film does not let him reach his full potential (luckily for us there is the movie `Drive' - there is a god). The cover is a total sell out. The villains on the back are not all used, oh sure they are used but some are only just in the background.Double Dragon, lots of potential, yet the Power Rangers movie is better than this.That's sad.Well we all have movies to laugh about....I guess...just don't bother. The animated series was better I must add."
1,Horrible,"This is a horribly bad movie. I was a big fan of the video game, and I wanted to see this, but when I watched it, I found out it had little to do with the game. This is worse than the mario bros. movie, which wasn't that good either. Like I said before, don't bother with this movie."
2,For the young men in the house,"Double Dragon is harmless enough in its cartoonish portrayl of evil vs good. If your a Mark Dacascos fan looking for a good meaty role here, this is not your movie. Mark is limited to kicks and smirks, with little emphasis on acting. All of the villians overact to the extreme. The action sequenses surprisenly are without alot of passion and artistry. This is surprising given Dacascos abilities. But then again this was early on in his movie career. The movie does entertain boys 12 and under, but for anyone older, or with more mature tastes, this movie may not do anything for you."
3,Just Ok,"I will give this just an ok. It winds up really easy, the end of it is easy to attach wires to, but it doesn't always unwind easily. You have to fiddle with it a couple of times while pulling out the tape to get it to go."
3,Serviceable fish tape,"This tape can be sticky to pull out by hand. I ignored the package instructions and spooled it all the way out by cranking clockwise, then reeled it all the way back in, cranked back hard, eased back to neutral, and repeated a few times. Each time got easier. There seems to be some lubricant on the tape; I imagine the spool/reel procedure spreads that lube out from where it settled during shipment. The lubricant will pick up pet fur and dirt and bring it back to build up where the cable enters the housing.Once you've broken it in like that, it works well enough. The grip sits comfortably in the hand, and the assembly is plenty light, enough so that you won't be annoyed at carrying it as you run around the work site. That's all I wanted from this 25-foot fish tape; I didn't want to have to deal with an unwieldy mess of four times as much tape as I expect I'll ever need for wiring my house."
2,Pain in the buttocks to use,Am I dense? I found this fish tape very hard to use. So hard to get the steel tape out. I had to pull hard. Reeling it in is easier. Am I holding/using it wrong?
1,this movie is terrible,"do not even rent this movie. it is absolutely terrible. low budget obviously and the actors except for the main guy are terrible. the first review isn't a review, it is just a summary so don't take it for anything."
3,not the worst movie ever,"the movie isn;'t that bad at all, its well shot.... beautiful lighting, and hot girls... script is not to hot, effects are not to hot, acting is not to hot, the movie has a few good points, and it entertained me, so i guess it's done it's job"
3,NOT THE WORSE VAMPIRE FILM,"Like all good vampires films, it delivers on cleavage. The beginning was good enough to hold my attention. However after the main character re-animated, it went downhill. What started out as a clever campy movie degraded into B grade film. And in my R rated version, the women have sex with their tops on. I would have expected something more physical from super strong vampires: tossing each other around the room, knocking over furniture etc."
2,Dreadful; must watch,"I watched this movie about three years ago after reading a review of it on the comedy site explosm.net. I got into it knowing exactly how awful it was going to be, and it did not disappoint.The plot is holier than Swiss cheese, the acting wooden at best, and it has the great fortune of featuring all of the following: a vampire clown, a vampire-themed country and western song, and a hotline which one can call in order to become a vampire. I have watched it with friends on several occasions for the purposes of shouting at the screen and throwing popcorn at this travesty of a film. For under $10, the laughs are totally worth it."
2,Silver Hawk,It is a rather silly story and even Michelle Yeoh can't pull it out from the fire. I think I will sell the DVD.
5,Chinese Superheroine,"Michelle Yeoh, plays Lulu Wong, a rich woman who lives a double life much like Bruce Wayne as Batman. Lulu's alter ego is Silver Hawk, a vigilante superhero who uses her martial arts skills to defeat criminals .The movie is set in a futuristic time (the technology used is slightly more advanced than what we have now ). What I like the most is that the movie is more comedic, or surreal than serious, which I think is the way a comic book based movie should be ."
3,Have had problems,"I like the size and the ease of use. Worked well initially but after about 2 months, the calorie counter went off on overdrive. It is erroneously showing an unbelievable amount of calories burned. Maybe it was just this piece, but I liked the fact that there is no chest strap and that it does not have complicated operating procedures. However, would not buy it again."
3,no stopwatch!,This hear rate monitor works well and is simple to use but I was astonished to find that it doesn't have a stopwatch function. Buy it only if you don't need a stopwatch (using some kind of cardio machine) or have something else to use.
4,Easy way to check your heart rate.,"This heart rate monitor/watch is a quick way to check if you are hitting your target heart rate. No straprequired. I love using it on my clients. As a personal trainer/outdoor fitness instructor, it enables myclients to see if they are hitting their target heart rate during a workout--quickly and easily."
1,Comes with a strap.,"The package comes with a rubber instrument you are to lick (yes, lick. They do not recommend using water to moisten) and strap to your chest in order for the equipment to work. If you are allergic to latex and rubber products, there is a very high risk of skin irritation to the area.I have been unable to use this product because I happen to have a latex allergy and do not wish to risk an outbreak."
1,Ships with dead batteries,"When first opened, this watch was already dead. I returned it for a replacement, and the first time the replacement watch was used, its battery died as well. Unless you want to buy a new battery as soon as you get this, don't waste your money. I suspect these have been 'on the shelf' for so long the batteries are drained by now. Try a more current model if you can find one. I am convinced this is old inventory."
4,works really good,The sports watch works reaaly good have no trouble with the direction and have used it for when i walk and exerciseI have even checked against other types of heart rate monitors and it always comes out the same. very happy with it
2,Has stopped working already,"I bought this less than a month ago. Wore it a few times around the office at first to see how it worked. It worked well. Got very sick (& lazy!) & missed my workouts for a week or so. First time I tried to use the monitor within the last week while on my elliptical, it just died on me. I don't know if it came with bad batteries, or if something else is wrong with it. I was so disgusted I just tossed it aside and haven't had time to look at it again. I'm not sure I can recommend this one - but perhaps I just got a lemon."
1,Dead on Arrival!,Battery or circuit bad. Replacement of battery didn't help. Not worth the effort to return.
1,Piece of junk,"I bought this watch for my wife for Christmas. Out of the box, it did not work. Amazon sent a replacement (quickly) - it TOO did not work. Finally, my wife called the company who then sent an upgraded replacement that worked. Evidentally they've had problems wth this unit. Don't waste your time or money."
5,Awesome flag really large and great quality,Shipped quickly and exactly as ordered. Its really huge easy to set up and looks great right about by the mailbox thanks again
5,Glad Ovenware,"I take a day every so often and cook up a bunch of freezer entrees to have handy for those busy days. I prefer not to use my regular bakeware as then it is tied up in the freezer until I cook the freezer meal. I then switched to freezer bags, plastic containers, foil pans, etc., but Glad Ovenware is my favorite hands-down. You don't have to transfer the entrees to cook them as with freezer bags and plastic containers. Foil pans you don't have to hassle with transferring to cook but the pans are flimsy and don't hold up well in the freezer. Glad Ovenware is convenient and holds up so well that many times I wash and reuse the container before throwing away. Also if I give a meal away to someone in need, they don't have to worry about returning a dish. I originally purchased these at the grocery store and then was unable to find them anywhere. Once again, Amazon to the rescue and now I have a case of the 8x8 and 9x13 pans ready and waiting."
4,One flaw...,"These are fabulous except that even new, the lids don't fit well. We have to wrap them in foil to keep the lids tight. We use them for our freezer club and they are just the right size!!!"
4,"Great Product, but it breaks easily","Although I love them, there are two things with the lids that I dislike. First the handles break really easy. As a matter of fact, several came out of the package damaged. Second and this is my biggest issue with them, the lids don't always stay on so well. However if you can get the lids seated well they work beautifully!"
1,not a good product,"Good idea but needs improvement. Lids don't fit well. Don't put the lids in the oven; no I didn't read the instructions, but it says ovenware. Once these are improved - if nothing else ""Don't put lid in oven"" - in BOLD PRINT on front of packaging - I think these will be fabulous!"
3,decent,"got a box of these for our once a month cooking group. they work nicely, but the tops tend to crack and don't seal well"
2,The only erector set woth the money,This is an ok item. At least i wasn't dissapointed with this as i was with the 50 in one BIG set i bought. This is just what you'd expect.
1,over-written and too academic,"I think this is a terrible book! I'm not a self-help junky but my idea of a good book on this topic would be concise and clear, without the academic jargon, footnotes, and social-worker-speak. More of a conversation than a master's thesis. I also found the archetypes to be condescending and reductive. Really turned me off. Reading all these negative real-life stories mixed with very few positive ones was a downer, too. Mainly though, the writing style was awfully dense and used so many ten dollar words where simplicity would have been much more effective. Kort just couldn't hold my interest.I gave him one star for effort, and because he means well."
2,I hate to disagree with the other reviewers here...,"This album was not all that great. They're like a ""punk"" band that doesn't have a whole lot of interesting things to say (""cancer food""? ""too many guns""? please.) that had one standout track, Like A Drug. And looking at the liner notes for that track, heck it's got an additional producer and remixer for that one track.There were a lot of bands at that time that the label brought in a producer for the strongest track to get a single on college radio. It worked, the singe got airplay, but I remember when I bought the album and I was like WTF, one strong track that I've already heard 200 times, and the rest is garbage.In my opinion, this formula is why a lot of bands were ""overlooked"" at the time."
2,Hmm. Yep.,"""The City Lights"" is a beautiful song with a compelling melody. The singer has a unique voice that compliments the music perfectly. Well done on that song, Umbrellas. Unfortunately, the rest of the album fails to support this bloody terrific track. Keep an eye on these fellows, they may hit their stride yet."
3,its alright,welp for all its worth this a pleasent album. a collection of tuneful and sparse spidery guitar driven pop tunes. But it doesnt hurt to mention how slow and anti-climatic this album can be. i mean it wouldnt heard to add a little more then such snail paced tempo and Ed rose putting so much window dressing to make it interesting.The lead man has nice poppy voice than definetly sounds emo and manages to carry the tiny songs. The piano gives the music a melancoly moments and the music takes afew details out of the senimental mode and something more playful. But for the msot part its a senimental postcard from start to finish. and more less is stereotypical emo-pop
2,umbrellas are not equal,"While listening to Umbrellas for the first time, I decided to read the reviews for them on this site. First of all, Umbrellas are nothing like Radiohead. If you want a comparable band, I'd check out THE ELECTED. The lead singer in The Elected sounds very similar to that of Umbrellas. Although, neither The Elected or Umbrellas are amazing,they are more of a pop-like band. Overall, I've heard better."
4,"A broad-ranging, handy reference tool","I bought this book (so much more affordable than its big brotherThe Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church) for my graduate studies in Syriac, the language of a huge section of the early church. I am a linguist rather than a theologian, and I found I was having a terrible time keeping track of the many factions in the Christological controversies of the 4th and 5th centuries, which are dealt with by numerous Syriac writers. This little book proved very helpful as an aid to sorting them out."
1,Unreliable and Inaccurate,"IF YOU WANT REAL INFORMATION ABOUT TOLKIEN, THE LORD OF THE RINGS, OR ANY OF HIS OTHER BOOKS, DO NOT READ THIS BOOK, OR ANYTHING ELSE BY DAVID DAY!I was given a copy of this book as a christmas present a number of years ago, and naively perused it, fascinated by the 'insights' into Tolkien's mythos and world. However, once I actually started to study Tolkien, I quickly realized just how completely bogus most of the stuff Day writes is.One particular example that always strikes me is Day's entry on dragons, where he claims that there are three kinds of dragons: legless, legged, and winged. This is just plain wrong- there is no hint anywhere in any of Tolkien's writings that there were legless dragons. Day just seemed to like the idea, and went with it."
1,Nordisco is Incompetent,"The originally had the ad ""Sold as 1 carton"" in the title, however they changed it to one pad. That was after I ordered 3 units and 'thought' I had ordered 60 pads. Of course they did not admit they made a mistake but did atleast refund everything. At the price for one pad and shipping, it's not a very good deal. It's paper, shop local for it."
2,Not robust,"I don't expect a lot out of paper, and yet this product still disappointed me. I've bought Ampad comp pads before, and this time it had new packaging with a cover sheet that is glued to the cardboard backing and then wraps over the top and around to the front. Well, when removing this cover page, it pulled off a layer of the cardboard backing right by the glue that holds the paper onto the backing. I was worried that this might weaken it and cause the backing to fall off, and sure enough it did the very next day. Also, the width of the margins on the sides varies greatly, and I use the margins so I find it quite annoying when the right margin is only 1/8"" wide sometimes. This doesn't happen with standard notebook paper so I know it's possible to hold better tolerances, which leads me to believe that the manufacturer believes they can be sloppy since this is a somewhat niche product with limited competition. I'll be trying another brand next time."
2,Buy more expensive or wish you did,Total garbage. Should have coughed up 20 or 30 more dollars and got a better one. Even had a wig burning ceremony after the final day of shooting. Caused me and my actress nothing but grief.
1,Tangled mess!,This wig is EXTEMELY thin and with the slightest movement of the fake hair it becomes HORRIBLY tangled!!! Not usable for my granddaughter's Rupunsel costume. It's a big mess!!
3,ok product,"When I received the wig I was caught by surprise, I expected the hair to be evenly spaced out, however most of the hair is at the crown/part of the head. If you do not have the hair combed properly you will look bald in the back. And, since the hair is very different from your own, it is difficult to comb it properly. The blonde almost had a red tint to it, I was expecting complete blonde."
2,very thin tangle wig,"i bought this brand wig its like two or three layers of short hair then on the top a thin layer of long hair its as long as the pitcure but very thin is impossable to get a brush through, right out the pack its matted and it sheds hair very cheaply made i really dident mind the tangles cuse its a witch wig but the sheding !!!the best brand wig i bought it was thick no tanglesit was a uk store [...] they shipp to the us very good wigs nice wigs"
2,Disappointing!,"I bought these towels because I fell in love with the crocheted lace trim, which I couldn't find anywhere else. The price was so cheap that I ordered two sets. But on arrival, the crocheted lace trim is beautiful, but the towels underneath I wouldn't use for drying dishes. Thin, thin, thin. I would never use these after a shower. Two stars only because of the crochet piece -- I hope to remove it and use it on other towels."
3,As far as sweeteners go it' good,I personally think it's very good you don't get that aftertaste when you use this at least I don't. If I run out I know where to buy it.
4,dark chocolate stevia,"It really tastes like dark chocolate with no calories! The only bad thing with this product is the packaging, once you break the seal, the lid will not stay shut, it loosens then the stuff oozes out!"
3,"No true replacement for sugar, but it works.","If you're trying curb your over-consumption of sugar, this will help. To me it has a bit of a medicine taste to it, but you definitely get the sweetness you're looking for. I use it regularly in coffee along with a mint liquid stevia to make a sugar-free peppermint mocha.You'll never find a perfect replacement for sugar. But like most diet adjustments, you'll get used to it in time."
3,If you are buying this hoping this is calorie free - it is not,"Neither does a bottle say so to be fairIn the ""other ingredients"" we have alcohol (7 calories per gram, higher than sugars) and glycerin (4 calories per gram, same as sugars).Taste is decent and you do need way less amount that you would use of sugar, so it is still a big reduction in carbs and calories.I found that if I use the suggested 5 drops - it is not enough to sweeten my coffee. It's more like 10+ drops for me.Just don't assume that if the product has stevia (which indeed is a calorie free substance), then this product as a whole must be a calorie free substance.I am going to try other brands to see if they are indeed calorie-free as they claim.That's all folks :-)"
5,Stevia Liquid Extract: Superb Product!,Ten stars! I have been using Stevia Liquid Extract since learning about it several years ago. I have ordered it several times here on amazon.com and absolutely LOVE the product and the vendor! I use it daily in coffee (and in hot tea on winter evenings.). Stevia is a much more healthy (herbal) alternative to the artificial sweeteners on the market. I've recently ordered another version of this in cinnamon flavor.
4,"Sweet, not bitter but still no sure.","Not bad, but i'm still not sure about that taste, my coffee taste completely different using this Stevia. And i was'n aware that i can only use 8 per day. :}"
4,Chocolate treat in a bottle,"This is a good product, can be a bit strong so adding alittle then working your way up to the taste you prefer is advised.For a no calorie sweet treat on a cold evening, try hot water with just this added... mmmm ! :)"
5,Best Stevia,"This is the best brand of Stevia out there--and wonderful service, as well. I have ordered from this company multiple times and they are consistently fast and efficient, and this is a great deal compared to in-store prices.PML, TN"
1,Disgusting,I used to order the NOW Stevia extract all the time and it was very good. This is not the same thing. It is NOW Better Stevia with alcohol. I thought it was the same stuff I always bought because of the misleading picture. I should have read the ingredients more carefully.
3,"It's OK, but I like KAL brand better","I usually use KAL liquid stevia, but this was cheaper so I decided to give it a try. Maybe I'm just used to KAL, but I just didn't taste the same sweetness with this. I couldn't seem to get the amount right.The NOW brand is syrupy whereas KAL is liquid, and you need less of the NOW brand. The NOW brand seemed to sweeten thin drinks, like tea, better than thicker ones, like coffee with milk. The KAL brand gives me consistent results no matter what I put it in.I felt like I was tasting a bitter aftertaste (NOW brand) that kind of ""stuck"" to my tongue, but it was very slight, almost ignorable and I don't know if I was just thinking that because I'm not crazy about the syrupy consistency.This stuff isn't bad overall, but I've been using KAL for a few years and this isn't good enough to make me want to switch."
4,Good for green tea!,"I've been quite happy with this as a sweetener for my green tea and mint tea. For some reason, I just can't get into it for coffee. I'm not a fan of licorice, and it leaves my coffee with a strangely vegetal flavor. It's drinkable, but not like what coffee should be. I have also baked with this and had good results. I'm glad there is a non-chemical low-cal sugar alternative."
3,This one still has a bitter aftertaste...,"I was really looking forward to trying NOW Foods Stevia Glycerite, as it was touted to be thick like honey and have no bitterness. While it is true that this product has a thicker consistency than other liquid stevias, such as Sweetleaf, it still has an acrid aftertaste. Oh well! Such is the nature of stevia. My search continues for the perfect calorie-free natural non-sugar sweetener. I will continue to use this bottle, but when it is gone I will not reorder."
2,Not good chocolate,"I was a little let down with this stevia, and the lid didn't want to stay tight so I have chocolate all over. I wish it were a little more chocolate and not so syrupy"
3,Not chocolate,It does flavor what you add it too. More vanilla flavor than anything chocolate... certainly not DARK chocolate. I used about 3 drops to 4 oz of milk and it gave it a pleasant taste. But chocolate it's not.
2,Funny taste,"I was very disappointed with the flavor. I used just a little bit of it in baking. This was a test recipe, so the ingredients were very basic. Nothing else could have caused this flavor aside from Stevia. My cupcakes had a distinct bitter aftertaste that remained in my mouth for the duration of the night. Luckily my child liked the cupcake, so I am giving it an extra star for that.I also tried a drop of it in plain Lipton tea. Yuck. Same bitter taste!"
2,syrupy,"I have loved using flavored stevia drops, but this has a thick syrupy thexture that makes it had to use and very messy. It had a nice flavor and the price was great- but I'll stick with the more expensive name-brand next time. It is the first time that I have used this brand."
5,dark chocolate liquid stevia,"I really like the dark chocolate flavor. I enjoy this in a cup of coffee in the morning. Sometimes at night when I get that craving for chocolate, a few drops in some hot water are enough to curb the cravings! I have not tried this in any other recipes yet but look forward to experimenting!"
2,ok,"It taste like a Tootsie Roll, not really chocolaty enough for me. It also has a bitter aftertaste, but some people don't seem to notice it. I'm going to try Capella Drops next and see if I like them better."
5,Read it for the Fun,"Bob Campbell's Do It For the Game is an entertaining read. It offers a railbird seat on the strange and unpredictable world of the pool hall and its quirky denizens. The slang, the descriptions of characters and places, the anecdotes, everything rings true. The book is, however, more than local color. It's also a journey of change (like pulling teeth is a change) for a protagonist who seems familiar from the first page-- maybe he's you, maybe he's someone you've known--but who may not be up to the task to surviving what he discovers along the way."
4,very effective,"This has helped me tremendously, I am back to running again!Only fault is the material is a little abrasive on the back of the knee if the velcro is not lined up flush when fastening. Otherwise great."
3,Good support but uncomfortable,It has really good support but the ends where they attach are quite stiff and there is absolutely not way to position them so that the edges do not chaff.
4,Try this first,"This may be one of the best inventions of modern non-surgical medicine. My wife has had a messed up knee for years. This product, which helps the patella stay where it's supposed to, has kept my wife from having to have knee surgery that may or may not help. Not a guaranteed miracle, but damn close, at least for us."
2,Strap is Too Wide. Straps are Too Long.,"The strap that goes behind your knee/leg is too wide and rubs. I will be looking for another patella strap that is not as wide. Also the one size fits all is huge. I need to overlap my velcro straps and my legs are not super skinny. (my calves are about 14 inches circumference, not sure my knee, but not abnormally thin) I cannot imagine an average sized man or women who the straps would effectively fit. The brand needs to have sizes. I may try to trim the straps, but overall, not pleased with this purchase."
5,Great Blues Course,This is one of the best books to learn how to play the blues on piano you will ever find. The book and accompanying CD gives you all you need to learn the blues from the basics to more advanced as well as to create your own style.
4,Fascinating,"This book could have been called ""Calibre of Heroes."" It is not a page turner. The end of each chapter will not leave you breathless. But if you're interested in the people who traveled the Overland Trails, this is the book to read. You will get an inside and in-depth look into the daily struggles of the men and women who risked it all, and sometimes lost it, as they scratched, clawed, and fought their way west in search of a better life.""What I Saw in California"" is a stirring reminder of the courage, spirit, and fierce independence of those who forged a great nation.Frank Allan Rogers, authorUpon A Crazy Horse"
1,PRODUCT WARNING,"I so want to read this book!But this product as received is almost unreadable. Literally.This is a LARGE format paperback, measuring 8.5 x 11. Now that I've received the book, I see that point is mentioned in the product description, but overlooked by me before I hit ""Add to Cart."" But the size I could have lived with.It's when you open the book that the real problem arises. The text, printed in very a thin, non-proportional typewriter font, flows all the way across the 8.5 inch page. Think of a very tightly spaced manuscript or screenplay from the 1950's, 138 pages long, where the typewriter ribbon is well beyond needing replacement. It's a sea of very light gray. My eyes hurt just thinking about it.I thank the publisher for wanting to reprint this esteemed title, but with so many inexpensive desktop publishing programs available, there's no excuse for a product of this quality.So now I'll go back and find a used hardcover. I still want to read this book."
2,Disappinting,"Maybe I was expecting a book up to the standard set by the first book in this series, on Amtrak. I am not familiar with the New Haven's service area, and was often lost when reading the text. The McGinnes era seems to have few pictures. For example, there is only one of the Talgo trains and none of the converted RDC trains. Instead of being a snapshot of the trains of the later years, as shown on the cover, it attempts a history without the photographs or maps to make satisfy a reader new to the history of the NH."
3,Good book,I found the book to have a great deal of information on the New Haven Rail road that I did not know. Having grown up on the main line of the New Haven it let me know about the route that I was not aware of.
4,Excellent Book,"I have recently joined a figurative drawing class and find this book very encouraging and insightful. We live in a world that instant gratification becomes the key to everything we do. Drawing teaches us to slow down and see things the way they are. As a beginner for drawing, this book answers many questions about figurative drawing: why we draw, why we like to draw nude and how drawing can help me see many things I miss out in this fast paced world.I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in drawing and art in general."
4,Interesting Read,This book was recommended to me by an art professor at the university. As an artist's model I found it interesting. I mainly enjoyed the stories about artists and models and drawing groups and the historical aspects as well. I found the other parts less interesting but still worth reading.
4,Easy and Informative Read.,"I'm only a few chapters in and it's an assigned reading for my Figure Drawing course, but honestly, I don't mind. In fact, I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys figure drawing and has ever wondered why. It is both a psychological and emotional explanation backed with personal stories and statistical information (so far)."
5,Prequel Film,"This is actually a very good, quality film telling the story of what happened before Dallas. It is really quite well done and enjoyable. Unfortunately, if you're a big fan of the show there's a chance you might feel something is missing-without the actual cast of Dallas the show, it just doesn't really feel like something you want to watch more than once,as a history lesson. However, a true fan won't miss it."
3,"""cheesy vocals reminiscent of bad 80's music""","Adam Morse's comments (below) Hits the nail on the head when he says ""cheesy vocals reminiscent of bad 80's music"". What he is too kind to say is that the production and a lot of the other (non vocal) melodies fit into the same category. This album is fantastic to listen to for the bass playing and terrible to listen to in almost every other respect. I grit my teeth while listening to this album for the pleasure of Stu's playing."
5,I'm urgin' to listen to the Urge AGAIN,"In short, this album has a very distinct way of accelerating the passion between my husband and I!! Without going into details, those bass beats are so encouraging! Thank you Stu for providing my husband and I with a beautiful love tool!"
1,I'm getting the URGE to trade this in !,"I was a bit disappointed with this relaease. Too much sound effects and singing and not enough slap bass. Some of the tracks are soo short, I can bearly consider them songs! If you're looking for heavy slap bass please try Vail Johnson ""Terminator"" or anything by Victor Wooten instead."
5,The Best Soccer Game Ever,"For all winning eleven fans and even for the fans of Fifa, this game is the best soccer game ever. I have to admit I used to not like Fifa but the 2006 edition is very good. However, winning eleven excels in game play once again. The game changed a bit from previous versions. The players don't move as freely but once you get adapted to the new game play you will love it. Choose your favorite team and play soccer the way it should be done. You will not go wrong with this game. It is incredibly fun."
4,Better than Fifa 2006,"This is a very good soccer game. The graphics, presentation, and gameplay are very good and it's a pretty easy game to pick up. The only negative thing about this game is the the commentator's voices are low and it's sometimes hard to hear them over the crowd. I recently purchased the Fifa 2006 and traded it within a week. Although the graphics and presentation are just as good if not better than Winning Eleven 9 game, the gameply on Fifa 2006 is terrible. Stick with the World Winning Eleven 9 series and you won't go wrong!"
1,...disappointment...,I am winning eleven player since 1996!!! Ten years playing all the games it is the WORST of all. KONAMI slightly improved the gameplay BUT the referee system SUCKS. And you will notice it while you play the game especially at six stars. The game becomes unnatural especially when you have a small team against a big better team. I don't know why they have done this but I think it is the worst game of all. I will wait for number 6...
4,"As good as these are, there are better!","If you're looking for probably the definitive recordings of these two sadly-neglected works, seek out the Pantheon CDMiklos Rozsa: Piano Concerto Op. 31, Cello Concerto Op. 32with Leonard Pennario and Janos Starker. The performances and sound are uniformly excellent and frankly transcend the Koch recording (but I cannot praise James Sedares and the folks at the late, lamented Koch International enough for recording and re-introducing a profoundly important composer to the 'listening' world)."
3,"Good, but repetitious and needs a good editor","The Expert Witness Handbook covers a lot of ground, from selecting the expert and impeaching opposing experts, to being deposed and giving trial testimony. The author is evidently well versed and very experienced in being an expert, and his opinions and anecdotes are laced through the book. This is both the strength and weakness of the book - the author's expertise in parachute accidents shows, but it also limits the overall usefulness. The repetition and poor grammar are more annoying. Because this book was published by the author, the lack of editing may be somewhat anticipated. Overall, I enjoyed the book and found it useful, but a good editor could have tightened it up a lot."
5,"When looking for ""the most""","A local New York professional opera enthusiast has concluded that Corelli is the most popular operatic tenor, followed by Jussi Bjoerling. But if the question is, who had the most beautiful tenor voice ever impressed upon wax, we must lift up John McCormack. Here is true bel canto which no one else has ever equalled. These two CD's contain some of the most exquisite sounds ever issued by a human throat. Let the galleries declare their enthusiasm for stentorian high C's, the real lover of great singing will find much more to their like her than in all the verisssimo arias. Listen to the two ""Mefistofele"" Arias (Boito) and ask yourself if they have ever since been so beautifully sung. This recording belongs in the collection of every aspiring tenor, just to remind what can be accomplished by art and perfect singing."
3,two terrific songs; rest filler,"You still should get this for ""America"" alone which has one of the greatest singalong chorus (basically just a simple ""Ah-ooh, America"") and the most biting lyrics on spoonfed Americans.Sadly, the rest of the LP does not go from there although I dig the title track and the ""David Duchovny"" love letter song.The jacket pics obviously show she's using sex to sell this so where is all that on the album? It's not a ""sexy"" record at all.(By the way, considering you can buy the actual CD used for a penny + shipping, it's still better just to download the two songs I mentioned.)"
3,Bree is Sharp,"Every year now record companies ready their Lillith friendly talent in hopes of cashing in on the market created by Sarah and Co. three years ago. At first listen Bree Sharp's new disc might appear as forgettable as past Lillith hopefuls BUT on closer listen reveals herself as actually having more of an orignal edge - pushing the generic ""women with guitar"" confines just slightly. Her novelity hit ""David Duchovny"" is instantly winning and showcases the singers potential when at the end of the song she shows urgency as she pleads ""Why don't you love me?"" But the real gems on this disc are ""America"", ""Guttermouth"" and ""Fallen"" - all perfect pop songs with hooks galore. As this twenty three year old talent grows hopefully she will push the boundries just a little more, learning from contemporaries like Patty Griffin and Dianne Izzo - as opposed to following the predictable path of Sarah and Co. This is a solid first effort."
3,this is okay...,"""David Duchovny"" is one of those undeniably delicious songs, featuring sharp lyrics and on-the-mark vocals. I bought this CD based on the great reviews it is getting, but I'm mostly disappointed. It's not as deep or meaningful as some would lead you to believe, and her vocals leave a little to be desired. (I had to remove it from my CD player when my friends rode in my car last weekend - they found her voice annoying.)It is a good debut album, she shows potential, and I'd be interested in seeing where she goes from here. This debut, though, is no Jagged Little Pill, Tuesday Night Music Club, or Pieces of You."
3,"Nice and smooth, but not fresh or original","The band gels well and many of the tracks really jam; it's an accessible album that feels comfortable on the first listening. But there are twinges of Alanis. Moments of Tracy Chapman. Shades of Elastica (""Guttermouth""). Hints of Jewel-esque cleavage in the liner notes. Heavily produced. Little guitar riffs that sound eerily familiar. Pure, distilled 100% Lilith Fair."
5,Great rock album,"I, too, admittedly was originally drawn to the album for David Duchovny, but sound bites of the other songs convinced me to buy the entire album. Boy am I glad I did. This album will appeal to both pop and rock fans alike. Although David Duchovny and America (apparently Sharp's next single to be released) are both fun and catchy, Fallen undoubtedly taked the cake as the album's best song. It epitomizes the album's strengths: great acoustic instrumentaion, soulful lyrics, a beautiful melody, and full of wonderful harmonies. Although David Duchovny, Cheap and Evil Girl, and Show Me, make you want to sing and dance, Fallen shows the true depths of Sharp's poetic and musical talent."
5,Lovely!!!,"I cannot even tell you how much I love this album. I heard the track ""Cheap and Evil Girl"" on an HBO special about strippers of all things! I was so taken by the song that I had to find out who it was. The whole album is simply amazing!! I certainly think it is worth owning!"
5,One great girl,"Bree was spotlighted on Amazon.com a while back and I picked it up after listening to a few clips. I was hooked. The songs are all fun to listen to and they don't get old easily. Being Bree's first album, the music isn't that adventerous, not straying far form the folk-ly guitar driven ambiance. But the lyrics are inspiring. I esecially like ""Walk Away"". It's a great song to listen to after a really messy break up with someone. ""David Duchovney"" is a great song about her infatuation with the sleeper star. I suggest this album to anyone who enjoys Sherly Crow or Shannon Cauffman. If you liek those two girls, you'll be sure to like Bree Sharp."
4,Bree is VERY Sharp,"Fascinating... she sounds like a cross between Sarach McLachlan and Jewel, without the horrendous Lilith Fair stigma. The fact that she is beautiful and loves ""The X-Files makes her even cooler; it's good to know that this _isn't_ a novelty disc. Gorgeous lyrics, and very catchy music, too. Overall, an excellent CD."
3,a solid effort,"The most origonal-sounding songs on A Cheap and Evil Girl CD is the song Guttermouth. I'd never heard anything like it before. Bree is a good talent, and the songs are fun pop style...I just think it's odd that she sings a song like"
2,No Substance,"This simplistic attempt at being dubbed ""alternative"" is truly boring. It has got that -- ""I have heard this a million times before"" sound. You only need to listen once and you have all the words to every song memorized.Bree's ""come hither"" looking photos on her CD are proof that the girl gets by on her looks...not her talent."
5,This CD is sooo awesome!! I love the song David Duchovny!!,This CD is the BEST!! Bree Sharp is an awesome Female singer and she is definatly original. I like that.
5,A great singer-songwriter!,"Bought the CD after reading the reviews and it doesn't disappoint. In a world of rap, hip hop and pre fabricated groups, it's good to know that there are true singer songwriters out there."
4,A Smart And Witty Songwriter,"Bree's album really is a stroke of genius. She is one of the most unique, most talented, and most intelligent songwriters I've heard in a long time. Her witty lyrics and engaging music create a woman who is carefree and fun one moment, then introspective and thoughtful the next.A Cheap And Evil Girl is one of only about five CD's in my rather hefty collection that I can listen to straight through with skipping a single song. Bree undoubtedly has a huge career ahead of her. She speaks to our culture and to that which makes us human. What a prize Trauma Records holds.Buy her album for ""David Duchovny"", but treasure it for everything else."
2,mediocre,"I bought this cd based partly on the positive reviews I read here. I heard the song David Duchovny on the radio, and checked out the reviews and bought the cd because others had found the rest of the cd to be good.Save your money. If you liked David Duchovny, buy the single, and spare yourself. None of the other tracks on the disc compare in any way, either musically, or in the cleverness of the lyrics. The title track is annoyingly repetitive. I listened to this cd all the way through only once, and now it sits at the bottom of the my cd pile.I usually dislike negative reviews, but I wanted to submit this one as a warning to others who might consider buying this cd based only on hear the DD song, so they can avoid my mistake."
4,Dana Scully why won't you love me?,"Was embarrased to buy this 'cuz I thought it was a chick CD. It is. But it is very good anyway. Some of the songs sound somewhat alike, but that's OK. And that David Duchovny song is pretty catchy (not to mention a real kick for fans of The X-Files)."
4,So smug and so smart he's abducted me heart!!:),"The only reason I bought this CD was for the David Duchovny song cuz I'm a fan of his. I luv this song the most out of all the other songs. Its not a bad CD, its very enjoyable. I like the song Walk Away. Great CD!! I'm gonna kill Scully!! LOL"
5,Wonderful Album!!!!!,"I first heard the song on one of my all time favorite actors ""David Duchovny"" but you know what there's more to this album than a fan lusting after a Golden Globe Winning television star--it's about her. I love her lyrics and her young voice which is a cross between Sarah Maclaughn and some country singer. I hope this girl has some success in the future!!!!!! Way to go Bree!"
2,Disappointing tapes,"This is a four CD set of tapes recorded at various locations over four decades, the 1940s through 70s. It's recommended only for the most ardent Stan Kenton fans, people who have to own everything available. The sound is poor on every CD and the quality of the selections varies considerably, from a slightly stumbling sight-read number, to a colorless ""Finlandia,"" to a rocking ""Aquarius,"" to an inspired and beautiful ""Moorea.""The packaging is admirable and the intentions of the producers were noble. But this is a collection that on the whole does not display the Kenton band at its best and does not offer much in the way of moving music."
1,MIssion Impossible,"Wamrm, fuzzy and shallow. No real insights into how verdicts are reached or how to persuade jurors faced with difficult decisions. Dr. Gordon is more humanitarian than scientist and the book fails to provide a look at the practical ingredients jurors might use in reaching verdicts in real cases."
5,The best movie ever!,"MAROONED is, in my opinion, the best movie ever made! Starring wonderful actors such as Gregory Peck, having unmatchable dialouge, plot, and excitement, this is a movie you can't live without! It is about 3 astronauts who get trapped in IRONMAN 1 with no retro power, which means that they cannot return to earth. MAROONED is the ultimate in edge of your seat action, drama, and basically all movie categories!"
2,"when critics once wrote about science fiction as silliness, movies like this only fed them fodder","a generation after ""destination moon"", and a year after ""2001"", this was the type of garbage that hollywood still was turning out and branding as ""science fiction"". obviously made to capitalize on that years moon landing (but before the next years eerily similar apollo 13 mission), this cannot be a bright spot on the resumes of actors like gregory peck or gene hackman or richard crenna (as for david janssen, hey, who cares?). rent some buster crabbe for a better plot and better effects."
4,Fun,"A bit dated, but that is what makes this movie fun. It's another of those cold-war era films that doesn't try to moralize on the politics of science, but just tells a good story."
4,Ok movie,I bought this for my husband who loves old Sci-Fi movies. He said he liked it but we both fell asleep the first time we watched it. Maybe the next time around it will be better?
5,"Marooned in Space. No Power, No Air, No Heat. Just Hope.","MaroonedThree astronauts are traped in space with a retro rocket that will not fire, running out of Air, Power and Heat. How do they get home. In orbit 200 miles above the earth. Only the senior astronaut on the ground has a plan that might save them. You need to watch this movie to see if MAROONED astronauts have a chance to get home alive. A must see Movie for all."
4,brings back memories,"This is one of the first movies I ever saw, and while the special effects are definitely 60s, the story is great. A little like Apollo 13."
5,Great suspense.,"If you liked Apollo 13, you should love this space suspense film that came out at the height of the space program. The special effects are good, the acting great, the story and screenplay (concerning a rescue attempt of stranded astronauts) suspenseful and dramatic. It's hard to find many serious science fiction films that will satisfy a space enthusiast - this is one of the few, along with Destination Moon and Mission to Mars."
1,"Sober, boring and actually unrealistic space film","How can a movie with such good actors be so boring? The special effects won an Academy Award?! Theyre horrible compared to 2001, which won the year before. The movie is devoid of suspense and humor. Some people claim that this movie is very realistic, but yet Pecks character, the Chief of Manned Space talks to the Apollo craft more than CAPCOM does. And if the Russians could change orbits, why didnt it earlier? Also, NASA tests their astronauts extensively for long-duration missions like Space Station missions, how did they miss that Hackman is suspect-able to space madness? Tip to Hollywood writers: Dont write a fictional astronaut movie. Movies like that (Marooned, Altman's Countdown [not his fault, WB took 30 minutes out of it, would love to see that one day] and Capricorn One) stink. It needs to be based on reality (The Right Stuff, Apollo 13, From The Earth to the Moon)."
2,"Save your money, borrow from a friend.","I love ""Mars"" and was excited to read a back-story to one of my favorite series. Unfortunately, ""Horse with No Name"" only offers a short and almost irrelevant story about Rei and Tatsuya becoming friends.The two other stories in the book are completely unrelated to the ""Mars"" series. ""Sleeping Lion"" was an all right story, but the plot seemed unconnected and incomplete. ""One Carat Fruit"" was completely disappointing. The plot was boring and predictable and the characters were not likeable at all.I suppose a die-hard fan could extract more enjoyment from ""HwNN,"" but I suggest borrowing the book from a friend or a library. Not worth ten dollars."
3,read it in the store first,"Ok. I knew that this book dealt with the friendship between Tatsuya and Rei when I read it, but i was hoping for a little more interaction betweent Rei and Kira. I was sadly disappointed. Rei and Kira's first meeting was told in the Mars manga in better detail then is this extra volume.The other two stories were nice but were not on the same leve as Mars in story. the only reason this gets three stars is because the drawing is as beautiful as every and it give some background info on Tatsuya and Rei."
4,A must for MARS fans,"Many were dismayed with the end of the MARS series, but the author released this cool story which serves as a sort of prequel to the MARS storyline, and gives some focus to characters other than Rei and Kira. A nice bit of bonus reading."
4,All you wanted to know about Debeers and too Much,"The book is a great commentary on the diamond mining and diamond industry. The problem is that author is an advocate against DeBeers and the diamond industry. She does her best to document the facts but every word is through the filter of her hatred of the DTC and DeBeers. It seems that they can do nothing right anywhere at anytime. Myself personally being in the diamond industry I can see her bias, others may not."
2,Kindle versus print version: Don't buy the digital format,"The print book is made stronger by the diverse figures, tables and images it borrows from other authors and thinkers. I am finding to my dismay that many of the PIVOTAL figures and charts are NOT included in the Kindle edition. The publisher was not willing to pay copyright and licensing fees required to include the figures in the digital version as well as the print.The missing figures phenomenon doesn't happen just once or twice -- it is frequent and distributed. I am having to go back and pay for the print version as well, just to have the full textbook when the professor calls our attention to, and discusses, specific visual information he assumes we all have."
3,Fair attempt at a lovely opera,This recording is not bad. But it lacks the feeling and passion. Singing is mediocre. Sound quality is better than the performance quality.
4,Great shoes!,"Much better than renting. I like the shoes, and there really pretty. Hopefully, I will improve my game. Good shoe, great price."
5,Cute and Comfy Mary Jane,"These shoes are really cute and fit well. Order a half size larger, as they run small."
5,WHAT A KICKIN TUNE,"I heard this song in Ibiza this June. Got back to Germany and couldn't get it out of my head. Told my friend ""you gotta find it"". I didn't know the name or anything but Seb Fontaine rocked the house with it .Well, thank God for NAPSTER! . He found it and I'm in heaven. This type of music (song) is for the party people who like to get their rave dance on. You won't be disappointed......"
3,"Not bad, not great but so-so....","I had to give this product 3 stars. The product wasn't very good and it wasn't very bad either. I probably won't ever buy this again, if I ever go through this bottle or don't give it away. If I would have smelled it in the store then I don't I would've ever bought it. It smells too much like a woman's perfume...very like...um, baby powderish I guess. As for the 3 stars, this is considering the following since amazon doesn't give any set guidelines for them:1 star: horrible2 stars: below average3 stars: average4 stars: above average5 stars: great- D."
4,Very sophisticated scent,"This cologne smells great! It is much more appealing than Chanel's Allure Sport, Versace's Blue Jeans, or Ralph Lauren's Polo.If you like a slightly stronger, sophisticated scent, this is a great option."
2,Frangrance definitely not as strong,I've used Burberry Brit before and the bottle I bought from Amazon is quite a bit weaker. The fragrance is similar...definitely not satisfied!
4,A Complete Fragrance,"I love the pattern of squares on my 100 ml cologne bottle. Just one spray can make me feel utterly happy and clean. Im wearing shorts and a tshirt on this lazy Sunday and listening to Nick Drake, for some reason, his voice sounds even better with Brit sprayed on me. I know there's no logic but it's just how it is. This cologne can be described as a superstarter to one's eventful day, either at home whiling away time or when outside conquering the world.It's funny and loveable how Amazon describes this fragrance by correlating it to British Men.("" Epitomizing the modern, British man, Brit For Men captures a relaxed elegance and effortless style."") I must say it makes me feel confident.Thanks mom. You should go to Dubai more often and get me Burberry colognes."
5,Downright Sexy!,"As a woman, I have to say that this scent is just downright sexy, and I wish more men would wear it! What makes it so sexy - as well as the men who wear it - is that it doesn't try to be. I HATE men's colognes that smell perfumey, and this one doesn't. It's just clean, crisp and masculine, with the cedarwood scent predominating, followed by the fresh ginger. This stuff is so intoxicating to me that I occasionally wear it myself - and even then it gets me a bit randy! Highly recommended."
5,Haven't found better,"I found Brit about a year ago. Since then, I've tried about two dozen different colognes (sample vials) from just about all the major designers, and none have topped it. Brit's strength is that it is the perfect subtle blend spicy, powdery, sweet scents which do not overpower the senses. Women seem to enjoy it as well."
1,NOT RETURNABLE,the quality is so low and you cant return itThat's ridiculousThe smell is so soSo its not a great dealbut still doubt if it is a fake one or not
5,Quick & great shape,"1 day, that's all it took! Packaging was perfect, after Christmas I will be able to review sent, I purchased off others rating recomendation."
3,It's cheap,"I tried this colonge because of 9 reviews with 5 stars and they did impress me with this colonge. However, its smell is not attractive at all, like a cheap one (yeah, the price is cheap too). Giving 3 stars for the cheap price only. I never recommend my friends to buy this colonge. However, the seller is really quick in shipping the product."
2,Generic and boring,"It smells ""good,"" but for gosh sake its a cologne, that doesnt get it any stars.This bottle smells like a nice light coat of baby powder. That's it. It lasts all day (6-8 hours in ac ool room) and I do ""like"" the smell, but it is very typical and bland. It has no character even compared to other mass-produced and heavily worn colognes.I wear it to work because its very simple, unoffensive, and... well... I cant return it, so I may as well use it. If I were going on a date or out on the town, this would be my last choice."
4,Pleasant and sophisticated,"I purchased this product for my son. He really likes it. He thinks it is to be used more for formal occasions than for everyday use, and will not use it for 'hanging out', possibly for work on some days. I find it to be pleasantly deep-scented without being overpowering."
5,Great classic scent. I really enjoy purchasing online for a discount.,"Well it's Burberry Brit.This fragrance captures a ruff and tuff sense with a modern flair. A fresh oriental woody fragrance. Smells like Wood, Bergamot and Cardomom and Nutmeg and Grey Musk ."
5,Versatile,"This is a classic. Not as mature smelling as most Burberrys; it's perfect for younger men. People love it and it can be worn year round, from the office to the club. Warning: it is fairly sweet so do not buy if you want something musky and traditional.Added bonus: you can find it for dirt cheap on Amazon!!!"
4,really good smelling,It smelled good and lasting power. The price was really good too. I would recommend this product to any other man.
1,Completely ripped-off.,"I never received the flower seeds that I ordered; but, in their place, I was sent Shasta Daisy seeds (or so I was told as they never bloomed). I notified the Seller promptly...nothing happened. Nada! I fairly certain I sent a second notice with the same results. I've waited so long now that I cannot remember.CAVEAT EMPTOR!"
2,Dead shred,"For sure, Moore has some impressive speed-guitar chops in the style of fellow thrashers Steve Vai or Joe Satriani. But while (most of the time) those artists managed to thread fantastic melodic themes into their work, Moore overly relies on washed out 80's guitar production and tepid chord changes to aid the mostly superficial soloing. Besides few sporadic inspirations, it feels like the last track was the only one that mattered."
5,You need this!,"Borges has a fantastic writing style that is mysterious, witty, and earnest. His poems are thought-provoking and enjoyable to read, and I definitely recommend them to anyone who likes poetry :)"
3,Borges Poems,Is a fabulouse collection of Borges poems. What I found dissapointing are the translations into English. They do no convey the real message of the poet.
1,Is it 88mins or 400? Complete or Not?,"I'm not buying it till someone fixes the description.Either it is complete, or it is not. 28 hours of footage works out to more than 400 minutes, which is only about 6.5 hours. And 1,680 minutes of interviews is a hell of a lot more than 88 minutes which is what is advertised here AND on the 1-disc edition. So is this just what was televised? An edit of that?Obviously this is MORE complete, but I don't think it is COMPLETE, and I know it has a horrible product description, at the very least, mistakenly attached to two different DVD packages."
5,The Nixon years at the white house,"If you want to hear president Nixon's point of view about issues of the times, this is the dvd for you !"
4,Great companion to the movie!,"This is a great companion to the excellentFrost/NixonIt really enhances the movie, adding nuances and other information that the movie didn't get into. Watch Frost at the beginning and end!"
5,Read the TITLE,"Oops!One must read titles!I got this as a companion to Ron Howard's recent Frost/Nixon movie, (which I highly recommend) wherein the viewer sees that there were a series of interviews - the first of which, from a news/historical record standpoint, were triumphs for the evasive Tricky Dick and nightmares for the serious staff underwriting the dandy dillitante Frost.Those preliminary interviews are not here. DUH! That's why it's called ""The Original WATERGATE Interviews."" But Frost came on strong and redeemed himself for posterity in what you will see here - just don't expect ""the whole 10 yards.""The actor playing Nixon in Opie's movie ""overplays"" RMN at this juncture, and viewing the ""real"" interview is imperative./TundraVision, Amazon Reviewer"
4,Nothing Learned,"Thirty years on and Frost's interview of Nixon is even more compelling.It is as if every shot and every word had been scripted and directed. Nixon seems ill prepared for the depth of research and preparation evident in Frost questioning. This is drama at its best and its real. And Frost despite the affected, feined and sometimes breathy interview style actually pulls it off like no other.What is it about Nixon's reflections on Watergate that now resonates so much with the style and nature of the political leadership that lead the shamefully described ""coalition of the willing""? Still they are blinded by power, still they are without integrity, still truth doesnt matter.For political nutters, this is a must have DVD. It will sit alongside my autographed copy of Nixon's memoirs. I still wonder whether the signature is genuine. Doesnt that say it all."
1,What does COMPLETE mean?,"Why does the title state ""The Complete Interviews"". It is a lie. It is false advertising.The COMPLETE INTERVIEWS are 28 hours long.This is 88 minutes of excepts. Ironic that Amazon is telling lies to sell DVD's of a liar."
5,Wow!!,A must have for any DVD library! A piece of American history not soon to be repeated! I couldn't take my eyes off the screen!
2,Where is the rest of the interview?,Very disappointing...Frost should have released the entire set of broadcast interviews rather than this heavily edited DVD.
4,I am amazed at this movie.,I find David Frost's courage refreshing. I don't think that Nixon knew what he was up against while being interviewed. I am glad that Nixon was held accountable for his actions. Great movie.
4,"Oh, why don't you behave?","Collecting the complete color comics from 1934-1936, this volume even includes the earliest strips featuring actress Helen Kane, the Boop-Boop-a-Doop Girl. While Fleischer dropped the Kane conceit relatively quickly, the strip's Hollywood elements continued. Despite the Koko the Clown ""Out of the Inkwell"" anomaly, the storyline is relatively continuous, portraying page-long parables touching on fashion faux pas, affectionate appraisals, the foibles of fandom, liberated women, and challenging children. The recurring characters of the director, Aunt Tilly, Hunky, and Bubby contribute some consistency, but for the most part, the strip's cameo characters -- including Betty's many love interests, pretty boys all -- are relatively interchangeable. Bill Blackbeard's introductory essay adds some valuable cultural context to what might otherwise be mistaken as a one-joke wonder or Hollywood licensing deal, making the book a solid source of comic strip history...."
4,"Two years of Betty, the most scantily dressed cartoon girl","The way she was drawn, Betty Boop could be considered a form of soft porn. On the cover of this collection, she is lying in bed wearing some form of slip and approximately half her breast is exposed. In most captions, she is wearing a very short dress with a garter on her left thigh. The top of the dress looks like a set of mouse ears, as the only thing it covers is her breasts. Her muscular aunt Tillie swings her fists in many of the cartoons and Bubby the bratty baby also regularly appears. Given the state of modern cartoons, Betty is a bit of archaic character. Nevertheless, if you have seen some of her cartoons, you will probably enjoy reading these comics taken from the color Sunday pages."
3,Roots of Evil,"ROOTS OF EVIL is like two movies throw together to save time, money, and film. The result is something that is not quite as good as it could have been. The plot concerns two detectives on the trail of a drug lord's killer, as well as a serial killer that is targeting hookers. Trying to track down the culprits leads them to a variety of seedy locations (the highlight of the movie is a scene on the set of a B-movie, that parodys the genre so well you can't help but laugh). The film also includes tons of gratuitous sex and nudity, so if that's what you're looking for this is for you. But if you are looking for something more suspensful and a bit more coherent, you'd best keep looking, though for those of us with tastes that are not that discriminating, you might have some fun."
2,not unrated,"This video may be more enjoyable if you find the unrated version, which has about three more minutes."
5,Great wall mount for TV,"Received the wall mount quickly, it was better than I expected and works perfectly with my 50"" Plasma, the directions were easy to follow, I love it! I've reccommended it to several of my friends."
4,Great Item,Pro: Easy to assemble and install. Price was good also.Con: A bit too heavy. One person cannot handle job.
5,Strong and Stylish,"I used this to mount my 52"" Samsung LCD and it isplenty strong enough. Takes a bit of planning to install, but if you are careful it is no big problem. I use ti to swing the TV at it far extent to view from the Kitchen and it works great and seems to have no problems. Looks good too with the arms extended due to the finish."
4,Not so universal after all,"This thing is super sturdy and I'm sure it's an absolutely wonderful mount... for the TV it works on. Unfortunately I had a hard time finding the list of supported TVs, my bad for not searching harder I suppose. In the end it turns out it doesn't support my 46"" Sharp Aquos. The only TVs this will not support are TVs that have their mounting screws less than 8"" apart on the rear of the television as that's how wide the plate is the TV mounts to. If you have a 46"" Sharp Aquos you're going to need to remove (no easy task) the two lips that contain the support screws on the mounting plate... probably not the safest alternative but since Sharp does have their mounting screws so close together the effect (i'm hoping) should be pretty minimal. If you have an Aquos be sure to measure the distance between those screws before ordering or simply look elsewhere.UPDATE - The mount just survived a 5.6 Earthquake just fine. Sturdy like a rock and no flex when extended. Good stuff."
5,Spanish Vocab,This really is helping my son who a missionary- It goes beyond the dictionary- giving much more help with just simply speaking to others.
1,Too small for any fish,"Anyone considering a fish for a pet should do their research. This is NOT the recommended aquarium size for betas or any fish. Think carefully before purchasing any pet and do your research. Many pet habitats you find in the toy section are too small, like this one.Contrary to what others on here are saying, betas do best in at least 1-2 gallons or more, and yes, they can be tankmates in much larger aquariums with no problems.The small containers pet stores use for betas are only meant to be temporary.For only a few dollars more than this, you can purchase a filtered 2 gallon kit at any pet sore chain and even in some department stores. Many larger theme tanks - including sponge bob are also available."
1,Just a couple of things...,"1. They sell betas in the little cups in stores out of sheer convenience and cost effectiveness.2. Beta's DO NOT need to be kept alone. They simply cannot be kept with other beta's. I have a very happy little guy I have had for 2 years in a tank with about 10 other fish of all shapes, sizes and colors. And my beta uses EVERY INCH of our 40+ gallon tank.3. Yes, a beta may survive in this tank but I would think we would like to provide the best habitat possible for a new pet.4. You can pick up a 2.5 gallon tank with a filter at Petsmart for about $20. Not only will your little fish be happier you can spare yourself the frequent (well, *as* frequent) water changes.5. I am appalled that anyone would use this tank for a fish of any size."
3,Betta fish,"The person before me knows wat they are talking about. DO NOT LISTEN TO THE LAST PERSON!! betta fish should be alone, they cannot be in a tank with other fish, or they will die because they are FIGHTING FISH. THat person has no clue whatsoever about betta fish, I would listen to the 2nd review person, not hte 3rd review person. I have not bought it yet, but I'm plannign to."
1,Don't buy this. Please,"Please, please don't buy this. A fish shouldn't be a toy, and even if you took the best possible care of the betta (daily water changes, high-quality food, a plant to further clean the water) the betta would still spend its time floating motionless, or, despite everything, die from bad water. Bettas are incredibly hardy fish, but they still need at least two gallons to do well, and five should be the minimum if you ever want to see it move, don't want its fins to rot, or don't want to change the water daily. You really should buy a ten-gallon or larger tank and put it in with a few other fish.I gave the educational value a three because I hope the kids who get this will learn something after the fish has died.(For anyone wondering, the pet stores that display signs claiming bettas live in puddles of water this big in the wild are lying. Betta don't exist in the wild, they're bred, and even they can't survive in these tanks for long)"
4,small fishtanks,"The above toy would work fine for a beta. As a tropical fish collector and breeder, betas will do well in a small tank as above or in a bigger tank, even with other fish. Betas can be put in tanks with other fish, just not other betas. For example, I have a beta in a tank like the one above and I have a beta in a tank with about 70 other fish. If putting a beta in a tank with other fish, you must make sure that you have no fin biters in the tank. Betas are called fighting fish because - two male betas if placed in one tank together will fight to the death with each other. They are mild fish and not very aggressive with fish other than male betas. A male and a female beta can live peacefully in a tank together. If you keep a beta in a tank such as above, make sure that your water is non clorinated, let your water sit overnight before putting the beta in it."
1,Bettas do NOT like little tanks,"How would you like to be kept in a glass coffin with people staring at you? Whoever said that bettas LIKE being kept in tiny spaces was clearly wrong. I mean I haven't actually talked to a betta but if you put them in a REAL fish tank they swim back and forth and dont' just sit on the bottom of the tank. The only reason they do that is because they are unhappy. I'm so tired of people using fish as shoes, purses, and other such decorations. These are little lives we're dealing with....think about it!"

4,Simply does a great job with the basics!,"I purchased this receiver used a couple months ago. So far it's done very well. In comparison to today's receivers this one doesn't have half of the 'bells and whistles,' but it does a great job with the basics.I went with the Pioneer brand because the my 13 year old Pioneer Pro Logic receiver outlasted my 7 year old Kenwood DD/DTS receiver. The receiver sounds great with movies (in both DD and DTS) as well as music (in DD/DTS or just a stereo CD).The best part about the receiver is the pre-outs for all 5.1 channels for separate amplifiers. I am currently running a powered sub and a separate 2-channel amp for the fronts and it sounds incredible.The receiver is also expandable to 7.1 channels.PROS:Reliable!5.1 channel pre-outsSolid performance for movies and music (great DD/DTS processing!)CONS:No auto-setup feature (see VSX-d912 for that)No learning remote"
3,Two Completely Different Herbie Hancocks,"The first three songs on this album are Herbie's attempt at pop-dom. ""I Thought It Was You"" is the best of the three - and it's not all that good, completely wearing out its welcome eight minutes after it begins. I actually shelved this album, considering it a total loss. A few years later, I listened to the last two tracks. ""No Means Yes"" is an agreeable instrumental - no big deal, but better than the vocal tracks. Then came ""Good Question"". This salsa-flavored jazz number features the biggest workout I've ever heard from Tony Williams AND Herbie Hancock. Fantastic! Someone put ""Good Question"" on a compilation, quick, and send this album to oblivion!"
3,Partly cloudy....,"At some point Hancock began segregating rather than integrating his varied musical interests, relegating his keyboard solo work to the background on his r&b/dance records--this 1977 album heads in that direction. I never got into Hancock's dated vocoder vocals on the title cut and I THOUGHT IT WAS YOU; they carry all the warmth and nuance of a robot (personal opinion: I prefer electronically-altered vocals to be used in place of an instrument, not a vocalist). Furthermore, these two tunes have little to say--one really appreciates the wry wordplay of the likes of Sly Stone even more after hearing the trite lyrics heard here, sung over increasingly stale variations of the Headhunters-era groove. Here and there you get a decent solo by Herbie, but at this point Hancock's jazz/funk fusion had mostly become less compelling and more predictable. Bottom line: only the last track is up to his high standards."
2,Herbie plays it easy-listening,"As an HH great fan I was very disapointed when I fist played this record on my sound system. Today I use it as a fresh soundtrack when my grandma pays a visit. Love songs, clap-you-hands-baby choruses ... this is really NOT the funky HH I love. Actually, last song is really killing, seems to be paste on the rest (different style, different personnel). Let's go back to my Headhunterz records !"
3,Sunlight?,"While they may provide amazon shoppers with ""helpful"" information, maybe certain reviewers should find something else to do. Write some books on stuff you know so much about. Does it get you off to look at your own reviews and see how many people find it helpful? Why the quotes around ""helpful""? Well, I was too busy trying to decide how pathetic these hipsters are to be enlightened by the lengthy reviews.I love run-on sentences!!"
1,May be ok for spoken word but barely,"I bought one of theses hoping to add the ability to listen to my mp3 player on my older clarion stereo, Well it does work but I have to crank up the volume on the mp3 player almost all of the way and also crank the stereo up very high and even after messing with various EQ settings the sound is horrible, Ear splitting highs and no lows at all.I almost blew my out speakers and had a heart attack since I had forgotten the stereo was turned up almost all of the way when I switched the source to cd.Nice."
3,"70s california cult film about alternative, er, sex arrangements","This is a comedy that is supposed to make a controversial statement about marriage. At its base is sex: a group gets together and agrees that exchanging partners is fine, so long as the others are willing. They move into a house owned by a bumper-sticker entrepreneur who translates his hostility into money via nasty sayings. For what it's worth, there are a lot of laughs, titillation that never adds up to soft porn, and some pretty good characters. Unfortunately, the acting is ridiculously mediocre, though it is fun to see the old playboy bunny, Claudia Jennings in one of her better roles.It is fun to view this as a 70s retro thing, where the free-love creed of the 60s is transmogrified into pure libertinism coupled with commercialism. Recommended for nostalgia's sake."
3,It took longer that I was expecting,"This is a must have book, it shows how sometimes life is very rough and unfair, the human will, and in this case of a little boy was stronger, teaches us that sometimes we have probles not even close to this situation and we get crazy trying to find the solution.It's a very good book."
2,image is deceiving,the picture doesn't look like the actual rug... I'm a bit disappointed.. The colors are quite a bit darker and they are less vibrant.
4,My own gift...,"This one was an amazing gift for myself. I love this type of mousepad. I used to have another one, still do. but, use this one now"
4,The editor reviews and comments,"Nora shares insights and memories about farming, as it was and is, in a conversational style. She weaves in her own philosophy of life, instructs us about the procedures involved in various aspects of farming, and explains some of the technological developments she has seen. Nora's book should help preserve a way of life for which long-time farmers feel a degree of nostalgia. At the same time it informs non-farmers about the challenges and joys of farming. Her many anecdotes keep the reader's interest or ""tickle the funny-bone,"" making the book enjoyable, amusing and educational."
5,"All Killer, No Filler!","Leave it to a Frenchman to insult this great band. Reviewer Dupont must be inhaling too many chemicals. Henderson and Willis are high caliber writers and players and this album bears plenty of fruit. Scott Henderson is a phenomenal guitarist who obtains a perfect balance combining a ballsy blues-rock sound and jazz sophistication. Signal Path and Dense Dance are worth the price of admission. Drummer Joey Heredia plays incredibly well in the interim before Kirk Kovington joined the band. This album marks their first effort as a quartet but no matter what the instrumentation, the music is focused and played with conviction. Recommended!"
4,just FYI:,"I love Anne McCaffrey's world of PERN but please be careful, this is the UK edition of Dragonseye! I found this information on Anne's site so I know it is true.Happy Reading"
4,Anne fan,The product was in very good condition and shipped timely. I did not know until I received it that it had been published under another title which I already had. That was a bit of a disappointment.
4,Review for Red Star Rising,Like all Anne Mccaffrey very readable. If you are a follower of the Pern books it ties up a lot of the un answered questions left hanging in the series. Very Good.
1,Look elsewhere for brad bits.....,"The case the bits came in was cheap and broken, the bits looked so cheap I could not bring myself to use them. I returned them unused."
4,The real song to listen to,"Bored from Christina Aguilera ? Bored from Britney Spears ??? here is something unique for your ears to catch... An amazing song with LOADS of craziness... You can't help yourself to dislike it... i REALLY hate rap... but this song is too enjoying to dismiss.Eminem isn't really my kind of a singer... Specially when i heard ""My name is"" , but that song... cool enough i guess... But BEWARE... LOADS of inproperiate words are in this song... So parents, make sure that u don't let children listen to it... it lyrics will be tough enough for them... u know what i mean... anyway... if u have like songs to be BaAaAd and sweet in the same time... this cd is defenately for u to buy !"
4,"I have to admit,"" RealSlimShady"" get 's to you","I have to admit,""Real Slim Shady"" get's to you.Its funny,and I'm also sick of the groups M+M raps about.That's all you hear on the radio,BackSteetBoys,N'Sync,Britney Spears,it starts getting boring.I've been hearing this rap song on the radio,and last night on a ""Real World"" show.I've never bought a rap record,but I have enjoyed some of the music,like ""Bust a Move,""M.C.Hammer,alot of L.L cool J.'s music,and this song.I'm also glad there's a edited version for kids.The part about ""Burger King""kind of makes me think.I guess I'll be doing my own cooking for now."
4,Yo!,"Nice beat, awesome beat...moving on. The lyrics are awesome, but the subject matter needs help. I really am a fan of Eminem, but I don't understand WHY he has to diss so many people. What did they do to him (if I knew that, I would give this track a 5)? Nice, fun to listen to, but if you really pay attention to the lyrics, you'll see this in a diffeernt light. You either hate him or love him, I personally love his newer work, but I still don't know why he has to cuss so much (I'm not against cussing, but it doesn't take a rocket scientist to write a song that's 50% cussing). PEACE OUT!"
4,Very solid,"This is a very solid disc with great sound quality and great songs. I was pining badly for some live Circle Jerks when I bought this, and the disc definitely delivers. Listening to this isn't quite as energetic an experience as actually being there, but it's certainly better than nothing. There are a few songs I recall them playing pretty regularly live that I wish were on this album, but oh well. This CD is a fantastic document of one of the best live punk bands that I ever had the good fortune of seeing. The Jerks never disappointed me live."
4,Thought provoking journey on the streets of America,"This book really raised a lot of questions for me to consider about the homeless living on the streets of America. How do I see these people, do I notice them at all? How do I treat them if I do notice them? Am I kind or snobbish or down right rude?A whole other thought...... What if I lost my job ( happens all the time anymore)? What if I lost my home because I lost my job? Wow! Think about it the next time you are walking down the street and see someone that makes you want to cross to the other side of the street. It might be someone you once knew or later on IT MIGHT BE YOU!!!!!This young Christian man and a friend spend several months living among and as one of the homeless in various cities in America. His experiences are eye opening, thought provoking, scary and some downright depressing. He will make some recommendations on how to respond to the homeless that you meet on the street every day."
5,Wonderful resource for HR and supervisors,"This is an excellent resource for working with diverse populations. This book is carefully researched and well written. I have incorporated many of the ideas while doing supervision of staff.This would be a good resource for teachers, social workers, and anyone dealing with people in the poverty culture."
3,A bit disappointed...,"I was able to read this book in an evening, and though I enjoyed it, I wish it had gone deeper into the individual experiences, instead of a more generic screening of each city visited. Basically, it would have been a much better book if it had been about 4 times longer, with more detail, description and discussion of the realities of being homeless."
5,REAL life.,"Having known Mike and seeing his transformation and excitement about his experience was an added bonus to the story. This is one of most real books you will ever read. Ever wondered what life would be like homeless? This book will give you a glimpse. Every page contains real life experience, something irreplacable by fiction. I reccommend it to anyone, everyone. This is one of those stories that should not just vanish in the shelves, but needs to be shared."
5,A Character Defining Book,"This book was absolutely awesome. ""Under the Overpass"" was character defining and told the story of an upper middle class man that ""CHOSE"" to live life on the streets with few belongings. You can meet some people in life and realize that God's love shines thru them; Mike Yankoski is just that type of person. True humility and grace are his two most prominent character traits. This book is a great read and pretty much sums up what being a Christian is all about."
5,Changing the way,"This book has truly changed my heart and my perspective towards homeless people. I feel compassion and a strong urge act out these emotions. It amazes me how one book can change my total outlook. I find myself stopping and talking to homeless whenever I see one. I give them granola bars and jamba juices and it makes me so happy to see their faces light up just knowing that someone cares for them. I would give this book to anyone to read because it challenges you to do what's right. As a Christian, this book put it straightforward and lets you know what is up."
3,"A little obvious, but still not bad","The book is a quick read, almost too short. At times I would have wanted a deeper look into this journey, feeling as if the author remained on the surface at times. The lay out is simple and straightforward and the narrative is uncomplicated. I wonder if the rough language wasn't the only thing scrubbed out of this obviously Christian-targeted book. That being said, I enjoyed the book and am thankful that Mike Yonkoski shared his experience in print.The book is worth the read and a good place to start when wanted to put action to belief. It would make a great study topic for a church youth program.I'm curious if this book was the catalyst that started the trend of young Christian man venturing into the world of the homeless for extended periods or if the Spirit is doing the same work in others like It did in the author and Sam, his fellow Christian homeless sojourner?"
4,Excellent and challenging,"This book will definitely challenge you. It's interesting to see whether you identify more with the street bums, the pious hypocrites passing by on the other side, or the authors. Although a few rough edges indicate the editing was rushed (minor spelling mistakes like ""heroine"" for ""heroin"", misuse of apostrophes) these do not distract from the overall thrust of the book. One wishes at times that the book had more of a unifying theme, or summing up of what was learned, or the author talked about how he changed in his outlook and behavior. But it's mostly a journal and odyssey."
5,Worth the read for sure,"I've tried to deal with the questions the homeless present to the Christian of today. I know that Jesus set an example of giving, helping, self-sacrifice. But how do I translate that to my world today, especially regarding the guy or gal holding a sign at the stop light. This book gave me some insights, though not all the answers. But it does help me understand a part of our culture that I know little about. So how will I put my faith to work in light of this book and the homeless? Still thinking on that one . . . and this book will remain on my nightstand as a reminder to not let too much time go by before real action happens."
5,"Great book, great service.",I got this in good time and in great condition. I am looking forward to the read and I would do business with this seller again.
5,Every Christian,"If you proclaim Jesus Christ and your Lord, you need to read this book. It will awaken the sleeping Christ living inside of you. Wanna know what Jesus would do, He would be about reaching out to people who need to be seen and loved. This book will shake your faith awake."
5,GREAT BOOK,"THIS BOOK IS HARD TO PUT DOWN, A REAL PAGE TURNER. VERY WELL WRITTEN, AN INSIGHTFUL LOOK AT THE HOMELESS THRU THE EYES OF MIKE AND SAM. YOU CAN'T HELP BUT BE TOUCHED BY THE STORIES AND ACCOUNTS YOU WILL READ. IT CHANGES YOUR OUTLOOK AND MAKES YOU GRATEFUL FOR EVERYTHING YOU HAVE. ALONG WITH FAITH IN GOD THIS WAS A BLESSING TO READ- DON'T MISS OUT ON IT."
4,pretty good...,"these 2 christian guys decide to b homeless for a year and wrote about it well. thoughtful, real, with scripture/praise incorperated well."
1,under the overpass,"bad ,bad,bad a wast of money, it was a good ideal to write to make money, but i saw no faith, and the author know not faith, nor god. if something happen he would call to the people that was HIS BACKUP.to send or come and get him, he look to his plan not god. that's not faith. bad,bad,BAD. he eat out of trash can, could not god do better. (AS A FATHER) I have been homeless with four children,(2GIRLS AND 2 BOYS) and god showed up and showed out. with MIRACLES. The word says the son of the righteous shall not be begging for bread"
1,this book is horrible,These people are on a witch hunt they are narrow minded and don't know what they are talking about. I am sorry God created the angels and good is good and everything that he created is good or has the potential of being good. Stear away from this book.
1,"Sad, that we have come to this . . .","The fact is, if you're actually considering buying a book named `the dark side of the supernatural,' the book is probably just right for you. It will affirm all of the short-sighted, narrow-minded, vindictive beliefs you already have. You will quite likely love this book, without ever realizing just how sick it's message is. It will never occur to you to wonder how a religion like Christianity, founded on the principle that we should try and love each other, has been warped into something as jealous and contemptible as the set of beliefs behind this book.So, go ahead, buy the book, read about how all the yoga practitioners and role-players you hate so much are going to spend eternity roasting in the fires of hell. But, the next time you hear that mainline Christianity is dying, ask yourself if maybe, just maybe, the fact that you have betrayed everything that Christ stood for has anything to do with it."
4,Another successful album!,"I've got to admit it but when this cd first came out, I didn't really give it a chance but then I listened to it again just recently and noticed that this is another great album from Mesh! Some of my favorites are ""Open up the Ground"";""This is whaty you wanted""; ""Petrified""; & ""Crash"" just to name a few. I give it 4 stars because it's not like my favorite album of theirs; ""The point at which it falls apart"" but definitely promissing for most of their fans. I'm not big on the cardboard packaging as it will fade and deteriorate faster, unlike the conventional plastic jewel case. I now have all their albums, including Fragments 1 and 2."
3,one book is never enough for three ships,"The book covers lots of details about all three ships, but misses lots of other details, most probably because there is not enough evidence for such old vessels. Modelers with extreme ambition to build the interior of these ships may be disappointed, but in general the book is a very informative one about the general outlook of the ships. As in all such books, we have to question certain items about the restitution of the ships."
3,The Library Recordings vs The Studio Recordings,"As much as I love the Budapesters I couldn't get past the quality of the library recordings. You cannot hear the instruments articulate very well in some parts. I don't know if this is because the library has poor acoustics or the microphones where placed incorrectly. You loose some notes and even whole phrases at times in a blurr. The studio recordings are far superior in sound quality. If you already have these quartets in a modern recording and just want to add the superiority of the Budapesters then I would recommend this set so long as you know that there are sound limitations. If this is your first buy of these quartets I recommend buying the scattered and incomplete Sony Essential Classics recordings of the Budapesters playing these pieces. I know the CD generation will not like the library recordings, but if you are used to listening to music with a grain of salt for the quality of the recording then you can enjoy the library recordings."
4,You may feel like you'll need a shower after this book.,"This book is full of objectionable and odious characters. And Barnard does an excellent job in his characterizations of the terrible Hodsden family. The victim (mother) of this family is so truly awful, and she rules over her family with an iron fist. The family lives cheaply and vulgarly, and none of them are accepted in their village. There's not much mystery here, but the reading is pure pleasure. We are forced to keep reading, and as we read we shudder and are grateful that maybe our lives aren't as tawdry as this. This is a wonderful ""in your face"" satire. Even the policeman in charge of the case is an unlikeable stuffed shirt. Barnard is a real master at characterization, and this book is just too much fun."
1,Don't Buy This Product.,"Kristin is right, it's sticky and it stays on the fur. Moreover, I followed the directions to a T . . . but when my cat shook her head, the product went into one of her eyes. It was clearly extremely painful for her. There is no caution anywhere on the label stating that this product is an eye irritant or worse. I bought this product to help my cat's ears, not hurt her eyes."
3,too messy,"I thought this was a perfect way to cut out the wrestle mania I have with my dog. However, this stuff is very sticky and it's more of a pain then it's worth."
1,Please note these don't come in packs of 4,Unlike every other item in a corner flag search these guys charge you $45 for a single flag.Please don't make the mistake I did by assuming (like everybody else) that it would come as a set of 4.Honestly how these people can value a set of 4 at over $160 bucks is beyond me!
1,LAME,This product is not what is appears to be. The quality is poor and will be ruined as soon as you use it in the rain. It does not have the mounting piece as demonstrated by the image. Don't buy this.
4,Birding novice solves a murder,"Rachel Stanhope is reeling from a marriage that is falling apart, so she takes refuge with her Aunt Miriam in a bird sanctuary near Rocky Mountain National Park. A novice at birding, Rachel soon begins to pick up hints for spotting and identifying birds. While she is on her first birding trip, Rachel makes the grisly discovery of a dead body which launches an investigation and puts Rachel and her friends in danger. This book is a well-written debut novel which has a wonderful Colorado setting and lots of references to birds which will delight readers who also happen to be birders."
4,Water Filter,"I have purchased this product about a month ago. It is good item because it stopped the hair flakes and my hair is much softer. However, I am giving it a 4 stars because it leaks from the top section of it. I had called customer service, I was told to unscrew it and make sure that the seal is installed properly. I did that but it is still leaking. Thank you."
1,complete piece of crap,"After less than two months it began leaking from the collar used to adjust the spray settings. Not a very good product, but I have to keep typing because 20 words are required by amazon."
5,Sprite All in One Adjustable Filter,This All In One shower filter is easy to install and works great. I felt the difference in the quality of the water immediately.I highly recommend it.
1,Teac GF-290 CD/audiocassette/LP player with AM-FM tuner,"The sound quality is poor because of cheap, small speakers; radio tuning isvery difficult because of problem turning dial, there also seems to be a humduring LP playing(it's also too bad phono doesn't include a record changer);there are no treble/bass adjustments. Probably OK for kids or for people whodon't care much about quality of audio."
5,Good listening,This machine was purchased by me as a gift to a friend who needed a unit that played tapes as well as LP's and the just love it. They owned one before and insisted on this one.Highly reccomended
1,FORGET THIS BRAND - GET A GOOD BRAND LIKE SONY,"WE HAD THE UNFORTUNATE EXPERIENCE OF BUYING A VERY SIMILAR UNIT, THE GF-600. AFTER A COUPLE OF YEARS THE CASSETTE RECORDER AND THE CD PLAYER WENT BAD. HERE LATELY THE POWER SWITCH DIED. CRIMINAL CHARGES OUGHT TO BE LEVELED FOR PEDALLING JUNK LIKE THIS.BTW, I CHALLENGE TEAC TO CALL ME AND MAKE IT RIGHT - 703-878-8952 - I'LL BET THEY WON'T.I ALSO INTEND TO DISCOURAGE ALL MY FRIENDS FROM PURCHASING ANYTHING FROM TEAC, AND i WISH TEAC AN EARLY BANKRUPTCY.LIKE I SAID IN THE TITLE, SPEND THE EXTRA MONEY AND GET A GOOD BRAND LIKE A SONY - THEY LAST AND LAST, AND YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED."
4,"beautiful, but not bach","From the opening chorus, you are immediately taken away by the beauty of this passion. The recitatives are superb and move brisquely. Overall, the music is very heartfelt and the intersperion of recitative, arias, chorales, and turbae choruses is splendid. However, don't expect Bach-like longer, contemplative arias- most arias are only about 2 minutes and many are not da capo. Nonetheless, almost every aria is sublime. Wonderful recording of an unjustly neglected work and composer"
5,"A great series, you'll really love complete w/really good recipes.","Got hooked on Debbie Macomber through this series that takes place in the Northwest United States in the Seattle area, really entertaining reading. You'll want to read them all."
2,204 Rosewood Lane,"I have enjoyed Debbie Macomber's books in the past, but felt that two of her recent books, Dinner at Eight and Between Friends, were excellent. She seems to have grown and expanded. I was very disappointed with 204 Rosewood Lane. I got confused with all the characters and found I really didn't care. Hope Debbie will zero in on books like Dinner at Eight and Between Friends."
2,Too Many Characters Live at 204 Rosewood Lane,"I've been a fan of Debbie Macomber for over 15 years and really was looking forward to this continuing saga.It did answer predictably what happened to Dan (from the first book) and went on to introduce several characters who might have had interesting stories of their own to tell had they not been trying to share the pages with about 17 other story lines.I made it through the 378 pages wanting for something that I just can't pinpoint. As I read the last paragraph I didn't have that same anticipation for the next book.This book just seemed to be a ""setting up"" point for the other books in the series ...I don't believe it holds up well unless you read 16 Lighthouse Road."
2,Better revisit 16 Lighthouse Road before reading this,"I am a Debbie Macomber fan-""natic"" from way back...so I was anxiously awaiting the release of this book (mostly to find out what happened to Dan.)This book was very hard to follow. It was almost as if the whole town took to talking to Debbie at once and she hurried to capture everything they were saying in the mere 378 3/4 pages she had. I needed a flow chart to figure out who the characters were and found myself wondering whether any of the stories were ever going to move forward.I imagine since Debbie's letter hinted at 15 books (see I am a geek and even read her letters) and this is merely number 2 there are a lot of character lines that needed to be introduced. I just was hoping for a bit more substance to the stories she had started in 16 Lighthouse Road.I am looking forward to 311 Pelican Court but perhaps with not as much anticipation."
2,Book was moldy.,I was expecting the condition of the book to be better than it was. This book had been wet at one time and mold was on the book pages. I will have to spray it with Lysol before touching it again. I can get better from local re-used book store. Used books are off my list to buy online.
3,good for leasure reading,"I enjoy Debbie Macomber's ability to introduce the reader to all the characters in the town and with each book you want to hurry back to see how your ""friends"" are doing."
3,204 Rosewood Lane,It is a good book/series but I don't enjoy all the repeat information given. People should see it is a series and start at the beginning to avoid all this repeating.
5,Debbie Macomber lives again !,"After hunting for months in all the b&m; stores for out-of-print Debbie Macomber paperbacks, I finally turned to Amazon & there they were.Finished my Christmas List in one setting, & they arrived within a week. Perfect !"
3,A book that has a lot to offer,"Courtesy of A Romance Review204 Rosewood Lane is a continuation of Debbie Macomber's last book 16 Lighthouse Road in her Cedar Cove Series. Love, marriage, life and relationships are the elements within this series.This book has a lot to offer. Although the book is centered around Grace - how she handles her life after the disappearance of her husband, how she discovers the secrets of her daughter, Maryellen, etc., there are clearly more stories that are involved other than Grace's personal life. There is no limitation of how many books following this series as Ms. Macomber states on her website.If you are going to follow this series, there will be more you could look forward to but it is recommended to read the series starting with the first book, 16 Lighthouse Road, as there are unsolved matters that will not be answered until you read the following book."
4,Left me crazy needing to know more,I loved the book 204 Rosewood Lane. I kept up with all that was going on just fine. I just got done reading this book today and I am ready for the next book in the series. I have my own ideas about the dead man and want to see if what I am thinking is anywhere close to being right. I would like to be notified as soon as the next book comes out. I hope my wait for the next book in this series won't be long.
4,Return to Cedar Cove,"The characters which were introduced in 16 Lighthouse Road continue to develop in this second book of the series. The highlighted character is Grace Sherman, Judge Olivia Lockhart's best friend, who waits in vain for the return of her husband Dan, who has disappeared without a trace. Grace is convinced that Dan is with another woman so she relutantly divorces him, much to the joy of Cliff Harding, who makes no secret of the fact that he would like to pursue a relationship with her. Other main characters who appear are Seth and Justine, who marry at the end of book 1; Jack who is pursuing Olivia; Stan, Olivia's husband, who is having marital problems with his second wife; and MaryEllen, Grace's single daughter who becomes pregnant. Macomber weaves these characters in and out of her story, and unlike many of the reviewers, I enjoy the simultaneous story lines. After awhile these characters seem like old friends, and I look forward to re-visiting them in other books in the series."
3,Too many People at Rosewood Lane,First time reader of Debbie Macomber. I thought the book was a little confusing. I wasn't real sure what person or family I was reading from one page to another. Found myself having to go back in the book to see who that people was or who their relatives were. I look forward to the next book to clear up questions from this book. Like who was the mysterious man that dead at the Bed and Breaksfast that night. Does Jon finally get to see his baby! Etc.....
5,Great value and service,Thank You for the books. All the books have been in good condition and shipped very quick. Great value and service
4,204 rosewood lane,I love Debbie's Cedar Cove. What a nice place to live. And I get to live there everyday for a few minutes with all her characters. I'm enjoying all her Cedar Cove books/stories.
4,in reviewing i liked the different stories contaiN,In review I liked the different short stories contained in this book. I enjoyed the different characters and the relationships the author created with each one. One story of the Vietnam veteran was really touching because of my marriage being so much like the character in the book. The stories wereinteresting the way they were put together with each other.
2,Crappy ending,The story was good although it was hard to keep all the characters straight. The ending didnt tie up anything and left all the stories hanging.
5,Should get 6 stars,"If you don't remember the turmoil of Nixon's presidency you might want to pass. If you know the names Woodward and Bernstien and recall a blank space in the ""Nixon Tapes"", this is for you. I couldn't stop laughing. Who knew what was ""really"" behind the downfall of Tricky Dicky. This is one of the best investments to entertainment I have ever made. Don't drink carbonated berverages while watching this show. It's bound to exit your nose from all the laughing!"
3,Isn't a 3-pack,"We ordered one of these, received one CD with one license on it. Shrinkwrap was intact. It may indeed have been broken out of a 3-pack, but don't expect to get 3 copies just because it says 3-pack. Still a darned good price compared to my usual 'legitimate' software vendor. Haven't installed it (we found another copy while this was in transit) so I can't confirm that the license key is valid/usable. Will update review when we need to install this copy."
1,Not usable for Dell computer.,"Microsoft Office 2003 Basic Addition was corrupted and had to be uninstalled from my computer; however, I was unable to work without it, and that version had been discontinued. I tried the free trial of verion 2010, but hated it, discontinued it, and continued to search for a 2003 edition. I was elated when I found it and ordered right away. However, when it arrived, and attempts were made to install it, it was discovered that it was for Hewlett Packard (HP), and that fact was not mentioned and was not apparent until the disc arrived."
1,"I'd hoped to use this on Windows XP x64, out of luck.",Anything to avoid the ribbon. Unfortunately this version would not run on XP x64. Another awful microsoft mess. Huge bloated fussy installation.
1,If the crew of Apollo 13 had MY particular watch...they would not have made it back to Earth.,"I purchased mine around the time of the release of the Apollo 13 movie.The chronometer simply does not keep accurate elapsed time. It does not click over at the right moment thus, you can misread the elapsed time by a full minute or a full hour! Omega could not fix it and frankly their repair costs and turnaround time is ridiculous.I suspect the quality control has gone down recently to keep up with the demand due to the release of the movie Apollo 13 and now the 40th anniversary of the moon landing.One of my life's most expensive and regretful purchase.Frankly I wish I had purchased a Rolex instead."
2,Not a Rolex,"I owned one of these for about two years, and ended up selling it on eBay. It broke down, and after a very expensive repair (had to send it back twice because they didn't get it right) I got rid of it. The build quality is simply not 'there.' The warranty is cheap, too, for such a pricey watch. Save your money and buy Rolex, although it's a lot more coin. They're built like a tank and have a seven-year warranty. It's the type of watch that you pass on to your kids. This Omega is definitely not.Rolex also hold its value, Omegas do not. That definitely should tell you something."
5,Calling All Watch Collectors!,"I purchased this watch for my boyfriend as a Christmas/Anniversary/Birthday present earlier this year. My boyfriend can definitely be classified as a watch collector.I did not quite understand what his fascination was with this watch and at first, it looked like every other watch. As I started to look around for this watch and shop around for it, I started to appreciate it's beauty. I read the history behind this particular watch and as I looked at it more, the more I appreciated it.I definitely believe that this watch would make a great gift because it looks classic/timeless and it is also durable as well.Amazon made this purchase quick and painless... for the most part!"
2,What time is it???,"I've had this watch for 4 years. It looks great, but mechanically it's been a disappointment. It has never kept good time. Plus, I had to have it ""fixed"" twice. The first time it was 4 days out of the 1 year warranty, it cost me $85 to get it ""unfrozen"".A few years later, the stem got bound up and wouldn't turn. Another trip to my authorized Omega dealer costs me $200.The watch is working fine, but still loses about 2 minutes a day. Imagine, $1,800 for a watch you have to set everyday. Buy yourself the entire Timex collection for that price. You'll have 150 watches that work!"
3,Not a miracle - but perhaps helpful.,"I am suffering from nighttime dry eye after lasik surgery. Drops alone are not sufficient, so I searched online and found this product on a dry eye specialty website. I use the product nightly, but typically wake up in the very early morning hours with dry eyes and the goggles laying next to me on the pillow. They aren't wholly uncomfortable, so I'm unsure why they aren't staying on for the duration of the evening. The tightening pulls on the side do seem to slip though. However, even on nights when I wake up prior to tearing them off in my sleep, my eyes do not feel refreshed. They may be slightly less dry than they would without them, but I am not getting the relief I would expect for the cost and inconvenience of wearing goggles to bed. They make work for some, but I'm not convinced they've made any difference for me."
1,VERY CHEAPLY MADE,I tried mine on straight out of the box and it broke in my hands. The nose bridge broke immediately. This product is no good. Im very disappointed because I cannot find a way to prevent my dry eye issue.
2,Tranquil Eyes,"I purchased this item at the recommendation of my optometrist for itchy, irritated eyes. I am a great believer in hot compresses for eye relief, and after using a multitude of drops at no avail, I figured this was the perfect solution. The product is comfortable and works just fine, but only for for a couple of minutes. The warmth did not last long at all. I had expected to feel the warmth for a longer period - not the case."
2,Not worth the money,"I have suffered from extremely dry eyes here in Colorado for years, made even worse by my laser eye surgery. I've been on the hunt for a long time to find something that would help me to use less eyedrops and maybe make my eyes feel better. Frankly you may as well just buy a sponge and stick it on your eye for what this product does- not really very comfortable and not effective. I was hoping, but will keep searching! Maybe for a different purpose (wrinkles??) but not what I was looking for unfortunately."
2,Weird- blurred vision,"I bought this product because I thought it will help me with my eye allergies, but it just made it worse somehow. I wore it only twice, and I was afraid of wearing it some more- my vision got really blurry and my eyes were red and itchy.Use caution, especially if you have allergies and high prescription power like me!"
1,Just Not My Thing,"The hard casing presses against my nose and makes my breathing, that is already difficult even harder leaving me with a headache when I get up. I don't think trading a correction for dry eyes for a nasty headache is worthwhile."
3,How to use on XP,"If you buy this not knowing it wont with XP as I did this is how you may be able to get it to run. Go to the setup.exe, right click, properties, compatibility, then check run this program in compatibility mode for and choose Windows 95."
1,Disappointment,"I bought this only to find out, per the package, that it only runs on Windows 3.1 or 95. Didn't run on my XP. Tried it on an old machine with 95, still didn't run. Waste of money."
5,Works as advertised!,"Waterproof cases are so expensive! (and heavy) We aren't divers, but spend lots of time outdoors in conditions hostile to electronics, skiing, hiking, fishing, at the beach, etc. In addition to water, dirty hands, sand, and dust are hazards.This Aquapac performs as described, kept the camera (Canon A95) safe and dry despite immersion in swimming pool etc. The picture quality was unaffected, but flash doesn't work well due to internal reflections.Well worth the price."
2,You get what you pay for,"This little camera case (like other Aquapac cases) bills itself as waterproof. NOT SO. It if fine for using your inexpensive camera at the beach. It will protect from splashing, sand, salt, etc. BUT do not try submerging with this.Real waterproof housings cost a bundle (sometimes more than the camera) for a reason. If water can find a way to get in, it will.I have used this case -- perfectly happily -- with my rinky-dink digital camera around water. But without even submerging, water did get into the case. It is simply not waterproof -- nor is it designed to be. A simple visual examination told me before I ever used the case that it could not possibly be airtight or watertight. Again, no problem if all you want to do is splash around.It goes without saying that the US government is not regulating terms like ""waterproof"" so Aquapac is free to say this without actually risking any legal liability."
5,Steve Howe-Turbulence,Excellent CD by Steve Howe. It's sort of an updated version of his GTR cd from the 1980's.
1,None,"This could have been a great story if the author knew anything at all about sentence structure, punctuation, or spelling. This felt like reading a teenager's rough draft for an english class assignment. Please sell the rights to this story to a real writer."
3,"An excellent story, but .....","The story line is excellent. It gives an insight to the life of the indigenous people of the time and the mountain men who, for the most part, joined the native american culture. But... it seriously needs editorial help. The sentence structure is terrible as is the spelling and the grammar. It's so bad that the reader spends much of the time mentally editing the story instead of just enjoying it. Also, the author spends a good amount of the story repeating himself. It seems that he thinks the reader needs to be refreshed periodically instead of enjoying a good tale."
3,Lure of the Mountains,"It is a bit simple and unimaginative, but the worst thing is that it is full of typographic errors. It apparently received no editing prior to release."
3,Enjoyable,"Repetitious, but I enjoyed it. Vivid and accurate descriptions. He has a great graspof natural history. Give it a try"
4,Lure of the Mountains,Enjoy this report of history doing the time of this story a must read if you enjoy this period of time.
2,Disappointed,"Heard complaints on the sound of my voice,lack of clarity,etc when I used this headset.It was returned"
2,GE heasdset,Hard to get situated on your ear. Find that my ear hurts after wearing it for a while. Cord not long enough.
1,No A Great Read,"I did not like the book at all. I love Monica Jackson, but this book was off. I was scared to go to sleep! This was not a love story, it was a horror story! I was attracted to the book because it had a full-figured lead character. I was truly disappointed in this book."
3,Great Ideas; Mediocre Execution,"Melissa Scott has put together a bunch of absolutely fascinating ideas that call into question assumptions about gender and sexuality. This could make for a great book, but it doesn't--the plot and execution are dull compared to the concept."
2,Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy,"This book is well-written in an easy to read and conversational style. Unfortunately, it paints an extremely negative view of pregnancy. The book assumes that all pregnancies are fraught with these difficult symptoms. As all are not, it can be a frightening read (unnecessarily so) for those with easy, complication-free pregnancies. I don't recommend it for first time mothers-to-be. It could be helpful to second timers."
5,A realistic view of Roman Times,"This book was very informative, objective and entertaining at the same time. NOt only it tells you about the real face of the senators in Rome at the time but it also keeps a balance between good and bad in Julius Cesar. The book is also full of very interesting details about common life in Rome and the parallels that you can establish as you read it with the politics of our times is unbelievable! I highly reccommend it!"
5,A different perspective,"In this book, Parenti takes down the slavish way in which standard history texts have parroted the reactionary writers of the time (Cicero, et al). In doing so, he provides a view of the events before and after the assassination which makes more sense of what the real world was like for the majority of the people of Rome at the time.I recommend this book as an antidote to the mind-numbing poison which is standard classical history."
2,"Like the author, but not here","I like Michael J. Parenti, but talk about grafting contemporary viewpoints on to history...this isn't ancient Rome, it's ancient Rome seen entirely through the horn-rimmed sunglasses of '60s liberalism. Did I miss the good part? I stopped reading.I recommend Gelzer's ""Caesar: Politician and Statesman"" instead."
2,Lefty history of the Roman Republic,Lefty view of the Roman Civil War. Caesar good. Senate Bad. Well written and thought provoking.
1,simply awful...,really it's the type of book where you read on because you are amused at the fallacies and inaccuracies stated as fact from page to page. luckily i was able to return this to the bookstore so i didn't have to lose my money along with my time.
2,Excellent Themes - Poor Organization,"Michael Parenti does an excellent job of reminding us where history comes from and how important perspective is in history. His concept of the ""gentleman historian"" is very apt, as most of our understanding of the Late Roman Empire is derived from the surviving texts of the Roman aristocracy. This leads to partially skewed image of Rome and of the common citizens as being nothing more than an angry mob. However, along with being incredibly one-sided, Parenti ends up rambling on for 200 pages about this very idea, without making any other important conclusions. The book would more appropriatly named ""The Assassination of the Gentleman Historian"". I would suggest looking elsewhere for alternative viewpoints on the Late Roman Empire."
5,Today's best saxophonist...period.,"What Eugene Rosseau can do on the saxophone is simply incredible. It's evident that he has learned much from mentor Marcel Mule, but he's also made his own distinct tone for the instrument. What amazes me the most is the ease with which he hits the altissimo notes on these pieces, especially on the Heiden Solo. He deserves all the accolades he gets."
1,Are these seconds?,I was very disappointed with this purchase. I ordered two masks. One item can not even be used as it was missing the plastic piece on the side to hold the strap in place. The other has some substance on the inside of the mask that is smeared and will not wash off. The items are both unusable.
3,WWII era thriller set in the U.S.,"What if the scientists at Los Alamos only had enough refined uranium to build two atomic bombs, and they used one of those bombs for the Trinity test?And what if, once the U.S. military was convinced that the atomic bomb was their ticket to a speedy end to the war in the Pacific, the incredibly vital remaining uranium had to be safely transported from Los Alamos to a military base on the coast?What if spies for Russia and Japan managed to steal the uranium before it reached its destination?Read the book and find out. Twisty, taut, and fun."
5,Must have ! Carry it with you everywhere you go,"Bobby Borg's book is a MUST HAVE! It's easy to read and he divides the book up in a way that you can skip around for quick references. I carry this book with me everywhere!!! His book is really a collection of facts that all artists need to know. Even if you are not an artist (exe upcoming manager) you still need to read this book. This is a step by step, no nonsense, straightforward understanding of every area in the music industry."
5,Must Have For Your Music Career!,"Incredible! I thought it was one of the clearest & most up to date music industry books written. Power packed with helpful tools & inspriation! Definitely one that I will always comeback to. Music,Career, goals, artists & bands, songs, management, promoting, business, LIFE! It's all there!~ Most of all, this book gave me the courage to really focus and give it all I got in this competitive industry! This guy is on fire! Read for yourself.Composer/Producer"
4,Informative,"An easy read. plenty of useful, practical(as the title implies) information, especially for the uninitiated.It covers a lot of territory broadly. A good overview of the Music business for beginners."
3,Good (inward) 3D for the price,"This is obviously filmed on the outside of aquarium, so the 3D I saw was the depth behind from the glass. The pictures are sharp (99% of the time). Music goes along with the flow.A LG HDTV passive 3D demo I've seen in a local electronic store showed fish sticking way out of the screen toward me. I would consider that worth demonstrating over this. But regardless for the price it's a good to collect if you are hungry to collect 3D titles."
2,a little boring,"I was excited about this product, but was rather disappointed. The fish were beautiful, but the space they were filmed in was tiny, so very little went on. I've seen fish tanks, and little ""dramas"" happen all the time, but this space was so small, that nothing happened."
3,Decent 3D Aquarium But Not Much Variety,"As other reviewers have stated, the 3D effect is really ""behind"" the screen providing depth like looking into a real aquarium. The images are fairly sharp and colorful, but the program does get repetitive after a while. This is probably not the best choice to show off your new 3D TV to your friends. It is, however, relaxing and enjoyable in short bursts."
4,Excellent 3d experience !!!,"Make's you feel like the real aquarium.. Just love it!I was lookjng for a bluray screen saver and found this 3D aquarium, it is the best screen saver that you can buy."
2,Boring,"I ordered this shortly after purchasing aVIZIO 42 Inch Class Theater 3D LCD HDTV with VIZIO Internet Apps, E3D420VX. I was really disappointed in this video. It should be titled ""3D Fish Tank"". The area displayed is very small. The back of the fish tank is a flat picture. The fish swim around a few pieces of coral and fish tank decorations in the foreground."
3,Nancy Drew meets Ally Mcbeal!,"I was so disappointed in this book! I used to love Phyllis Whitney so much about 10 years ago. But after reading Patricia Cromwell, Robert Mccammon, and M C Beaton, I just cannot go back to the black and white morals and predictability of Whitney's plots. I think if she just wrote romance, we would be more entertained, for this she does well. But the suspense part of her stories are just, well, lacking of."
4,Beyonce shares her best,this dvd had some of Beyonce's best performances and unseen footage...would recommend this if you are looking for her live performances along with autobiography too...I would like to see an updated one too though...this does not include her current album songs from I am.....
2,Not what I expected,"This DVD was defiantly NOT what I expected. I am a HUGE Beyonce fan and was excited to have a dvd compilation of what I thought was going to be her best performances, but it was just random performances @ some small venues. The DVD didn't even have a main menu; it seemed like something bootleg some one made just to make ten bucks, and honestly is wasn't even worth that. I could have gone on YouTube and seen better Beyonce footage. The performances weren't even her best! All these were old live performances and even though the dvd was published as 2010, ALL of the performance were from Bday. Nothing with Sasha Fierce. This DVD was defiantly a disappointment."
2,This one is on the director,"OK, it is clear why a new movie goes straight to download without a stitch of advertising. With a pretty good concept and some decent dialogue, you really have to drive the actors and scenes like Bangkok taxi driver to mess it up this badly. I mean just painful to watch sometimes and you want to like it.You can get just vested enough to go- jeez, why did they do it like that."
5,Great Pasadena Historical Hotel Book!!,"This is a Historical Illustrated Book of the grand,great Hotels of Pasadena California,past and present.It's highly recommended!!"
1,Not Good,"This really is a very poor album, Billy is not an accomplished singer anymore, even in the relatively undemanding country genre. His range is now very limited and the songs are truly boring. I guess his long-time fans will have trouble letting him go, but buy one of his pre-adolescent albums if you want to hear Gilman when he could soar."
5,My Favorite Book Ever!,"I read this book when I was really down in the dumps. Life was going wrong. After I read it, I felt so awesome that I bought myself a copy! I want to be a missionary when I grow up, so this also helped me in that area! It is a great book! :)"
5,P P in a can,"Nice product used this to attract the eight pointer this season. Remember to spray down wind of yourself. Or you'll become what I was the first time I used this, a giant anti-air freshener."
1,Expensive and didn't help,"I thought I'd try this this year. Well, it didn't make any difference. I paid $11 for one can. I think just as many bucks would have been drawn in if I'd put a $10 and $1 bill on a branch. Then at least I could say I saw 11 bucks.I don't recommend buying this."
2,bad nosel,the nosel sticks and makes all the product expel at once which is a waste of money and time for any hunter
3,"A good guide, but not the best","This is a very helpful guide to have, but I found the layout and information less easy to access than in the Oz Clarke guide. The 1999 edition is definately worth having."
3,Just the facts.,I found it lacking in information about pricing and availability. Two important factors when trying to choose a wine for any occasion.
5,Music to conquer the world by...,Beautiful classical/jazz orchestral music by a talented jazz musician and composer who is too often over-looked.
3,great package,"Well trimmer string is trimmer string. What makes this product review worthy is the packaging, specifically the serrated, alligator like teeth where you pull the string out through, as you pull some string out of the package. A novel idea, that perhaps keeps the string from getting tangled or knotted. But am unsure if this is specific to this particular brand of trimmer string.Unfortunately, right after I received this trimmer string, our summer drought intensified here in Texas, so I didnt get to use much of the trimmer line like earlier in the year. Worked well the little I used it, but the amount of string used was probably a little more than the last stuff I was using.But the package, with the serrated groove is enough for me to probably buy again."
3,helpful for new consultants,"This is more appropriate for people new to consulting, rather than consultants new to non-profits."
4,use for class,"I use this book for a class I teach. It's a fine guide to the actions of nonprofit consulting, vs. the business of NP consulting."
5,very practical,This is a very practical guide for consulting work. There are some usual forms that are free to be used by individuals but unfortunately there was no accompanying CD so they need to be copied or re-typed.
5,"*Beloved Benji... A class act... Then, now, and always*",Benji & Joe Camp did it again!!! Joe has a way of melting Benji (and now newcomer Shaggy!) straight into our hearts... and makes sure to leave us wiser along the way. No one does animal movies like Joe Camp and Benji. Benji... I loved him then... I love him now... I will love him always.
2,Pointless!,"Benji: Off the Leash was a very pointless update of the Benji tale by the same director of the numerous Benji films. I haven't seen any of those so I have nothing to compare this to, but, while I found myself enjoying this a bit, it was very cliched, predictable, and badly acted, with some of the most groan-inducing dialogue ever captured on film. The script needed a good polish; it felt like a first draft. Children, like the one I was baby-sitting, are sure to enjoy this sweet tale, but adults should steer clear. It is overlong, boring, inconsistent, and nothing we haven't seen hundreds of times before. Aside from a cheap way to make money, I didn't see ANY point in this."
2,disheartening,"I found this book disheartening. I thought it would be a book filled with uplifting stories about people living life as a single person. Instead, it was filled with stories of finding romantic love at unexpected places and times. I didn't find it to be inspirational for someone who is staying single."
4,Being Happy By Yourself,"Many people seem to think there's something wrong with anyone who isn't coupled or married. Meanwhile, some of those around us are choosing to rush into marriage, stay in loveless marriages, or tolerate cheating or abusive spouses just to avoid the dreaded thought of 'being single.' This book lets single folks know there are many wise folks who understand and appreciate singlehood, and that being single doesn't make anybody less of a happy or fulfilled person, or less of a good parent.I also highly recommend 'Open Your Mind, Open Your Life: A Little Book of Eastern Wisdom' by Taro Gold - another book that taught me if I can't be happy by myself, I won't be happy in a relationship."
1,Your Reviews Are Accurate,"I couldn't agree more with the reviews I've read. Technical service is also a problem, whilst they will contact you in 3 days! The alarm is our main problem, which says the battery is defective, while it has a 13 volt charge. Also, the alarm won't shut off with the reset button, which will start short-circuiting the rest of the system. I've gone through two batteries in 4 months, obviously that wasn't the problem. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT unless you have a family member who works there and can replace your system every 3 months."
2,Blown Battery Fuse,We have owned this unit for less than a year and the battery fuse keeps blowing. When we first bought the unit and installed it we had the same issue so we called the company and they told us to replace the battery. We did this and didn't have an issue for quite a while. Now we are having the same issue again on a battery that is less than a year old. There seems to be something wrong with the charging system sending too many amps to the battery.
5,Well built and reliable,"This is a high-quality battery back-up unit (that can also be used as a main pump). I installed mine about two months ago, and have been very pleased with it. My previous battery back-up pump (different brand) was not reliable. I no longer have to worry about the possibility of getting water in my basement because of a power outage or main pump failure. I hesitated purchasing this unit because of the price, but the ""peace of mind"" has been well worth it!"
5,A throughly enjoyable history book!,"Disclaimer: Yasmeen and Mihail Lari are related to my wife. Regardless, I am going to provide as objective a review as I can.I throughly enjoyed what I have read in this book so far! The maps, the illustrations, the descriptions, make this book come alive in a way that makes it simply a joy to read. Particularly if you have lived in Karachi for any length of time.I have often seen that the inhabitants of a city - any city - are often the least knowledgeable of the history of their locale. This is not very surprising, I suppose, because there is a tendency to assume that ""I already know my home town""! I find this book (and other history books that relate to my country!) opens up new revelations and provides knowledge that I simply did not have about Karachi.I throughly recommend this book to everybody, particularly if you have any acquaintance with the region or the city. The book covers details that are not found elsewhere."
1,Don't buy,"I bought this as a student guide for the unabridged Italian version which my class has been reading. While the glossary at the back was most helpful, this book only provided the first 9 chapters of an exhaustive work. The ""riassunto"" for the remainder of the book (more than 600 pages) encompassed a couple of paragraphs...Don't bother, the type style is difficult to read for ""older eyes"" also."
4,"Excellent litterature, different languages for the ages","Avendo letto I Promessi Sposi di Alessandro Manzoni, posso dire che è veramente una bella opera. Scritta nell'italiano moderno del cuí lo stesso Manzoni è stato pietra angolare,la opera è effusiva e descrive in dettaglio gli andirivieni dei personaggi. Altro a diffondere la lingua, ci dà degl'immagini de quello che è stato il medio evo nell'Europa. Vi la racommando!Having read I Promessi Sposi by Alessandro Manzoni, I can say that it is truly a work of art. Written in modern Italian of which Manzoni was a promoter, the novel depicts extensively and in amazing detail the comings and goings of its characters. Other than procuring the diffusion of the new national tongue, it contains vivid images of the middle ages in Europe. I recommend it!"
1,Don;t Bother Ordering from Amazon,"They may show they can deliver it, but (after a year and a half!) they finally just emailed me saying they cannot get this book. If you really want to read it, try ordering from somewhere else."
1,Only if you are Chinese,"The ad copy for this product makes you think that it might be appropriate for a native English speaker learning Chinese. Nothing could be farther from the truth. This is designed only for native Chinese speakers, and specifically those from Taiwan, and Hong Kong, as the included dictionary data will only input and output in traditional characters (versus simplified as used in Mainland China).Don't waste your money and frustration if English is your first language."
3,Dalgliesh May Finally be Puttering Out,"Unfortunately, I find myself bored with this book; and I was so excited when I say a new P.D. James mystery! I almost feel I've read this one before, and not just because the color ""fawn"" is in fashion. The seascape, the cloaks, the named and numbered cottages. I suppose this is to romance the long-time fan, but I for one want something new. I'm in the middle, I may actually put it down and start something new."
3,Dust off your dictionary,"Death in Holy Orders is the first P.D James tale I have read. I plan on reading others. While Adam Dalgiesh of the Scotland Yard conducts a secondary investigation of a death at a theological college more deaths occur. The investigation is the backbone of the book.One reviewer described this book as ""ponderous"" and I agree. The book is long and at times the detail is deep - for some maybe, too deep. The style of author James leads this book to be read slowly and with a dictionary at hand. I enjoyed this book, but found myself starting and finishing a couple other books while following Dalgiesh's investigation. I willed myself to finish this book and in doing so I was entertained and my vocabulary increased."
5,Death in Holy Orders,"P.D. James has written sixteen books prior to Death in Holy Orders and fourteen of them are fictional mysteries. She is the reigning queen of the British murder mystery. Many of her books have a religious theme. This one is set in a seminary on the bleak coast of East Anglia. It features Commander Adam Dalgliesh, well known to her readers and also from the ""Mystery"" series on PBS. This book was recently adapted for this PBS program. James is a master of the plot, but her strength is in developing the characters and making them become real. Some characters were eliminated for the T.V. version, but there were still fifteen suspects, and keeping track of them all isn't easy. In this book, the murderer also becomes known some time before the ending, but the book is so well crafted that it is only a minor flaw in an otherwise brilliant work."
3,Strange happening between monks...,"Every now and then, I crave for the book that will lull my mind intothe state of sleepy observance. State in which you can let pagespass by you, almost not noticing what is happening, who did what and why is the shadow on that wall green. So I picked this book whose title and sub-title assured me that it will be one of those.And it was. The story of the poet-warrior (in this case poet-police commander) is told many times now, and you can almost sketch its lines yourself. What we have here is mysterious murder, aray of tedious (alredy seen) characters, witty (and sad) police inspector and demonic figure of a main bad guy. Attempts at cheap philosophy and many cliche sentences puts this book where it does belong. In a sea of mediocre crime novels useful only during the hot summer afternoons by the lakeor the sea coast."
4,what about the leeks?,"Just finished my first P.D. James book, ""Death in Holy Orders."" Enjoyed it greatly. She is an extremely fine writer. The sympathy shown for priests who fondle small boys was repulsive. Perhaps that's how it's done in England. And what about the leeks? James never says how or why Mrs. Munroe (one of the murder victims) was reminded of the killer when she received a gift of leeks. Perhaps James likes to leave a bit of mystery unsolved."
4,New to P.D. James,"I had not read P.D. James before but picked this book up in the airport in Amsterdam -- it was available in Europe before in the USA apparently. This may not be a very useful review, because I have already lent to book to another person in my book club -- a P.D. James ""frequent reader"". I loved the setting -- East Anglia part of England. I really enjoyed her characters -- they were well developed and interesting. I believe that the detective ""AD"" is a frequent character of her novels and he is in this one too. Now that I have read P.D. James, I will be reading more of her work."
5,buy it,"If you are looking for a British murder mystery that you can sink your teeth into, you cannot go wrong with this book. I love Elizabeth George but had tired of Inspector Lynley, and was looking for another author. I made the mistake of buying two novels by Martha Grimes, and was appalled by her one dimensional characters and lack of imagination. This is my first foray into PD James, and am glad I did."
4,You can almost hear the wind howling,"What I like best about ""Death in Holy Orders"" is the way the author beautifully crafted the setting. I could almost hear that howling wind and feel the creeping isolation of the setting. I like description of buildings and scenery as long as this does not overwhelm the story; the amount of description here is perfect. I also like the absence of unnecessary dialogue and explanation of character movements.There are plenty of characters with ample motives for murder. Certainly such a plethora of suspicious activities, motives, and personal agendas all in one place is a bit of a stretch, but I did not find this at all annoying.I am bothered by the overly sympathetic treatment of convicted child molester Father John Betterton. While this sets up Betterton and his sister as potential murderers, I remain confused as to why only the murdered Crampton seems at all bothered by Betterton's past."
1,Deja vu?,"Have we not been here before? Monks/priests on an isolated coastline, the usual suspects arrayed before us, a death in an isolated cottage. I'm devastated to say that I think this is the only book I've ever read when I actually couldn't have cared less what on earth was going on- in fact by the time I reached the end I'd actually forgotten how the story started. I have to say that the recent Reginald Hill books beat the last few P.D.James offerings hands down for 'literary' content."
2,I can't wait for the next one!,"P.D. James is my favorite writer of this particular genre. In this book, I would have wished that her characters and plot had been tied more to our univeral angst. I would like to know of her tale of the common folks living very much in these times, especially those us living in but not of the world of commerce and the drama of rising and falling stock markets. I didn't care about any of these characters, even Adam seemed so one dimensional. If lives full of anachronisms is what we are about these days, Ms. James succeeded. Perhaps I am wrong. Perhaps the characters of this book do represent the self absorbed, aggressors we all live with these days. I am however,waiting for and will appreciate her gift of a new novel as I do all of them. Give Adam his soulful thoughts back again, please."
2,Death in Holy Orders is Deathly Dull,"I normally enjoy P.D. James novels very much. This was a surprising exception. The plot was slow, the characters for the most part uninteresting, and the culprit, once revealed failed to have a convincing motive for murder. Although it was nice to read another Dalgliesh novel and enjoy James' beautiful writing style, as mysteries go read another James novel. ..."
5,Another excellent Dalglish book,"I enjoyed this book which is one of the author's more interesting ones. I liked how the novel had less characters than in other Dal books, which is always confusing. Again, kudos to PD James!"
3,This one is good!,"After not reading P. D. James' recent books, this one is a keeper. Descriptions and feeling them have always been important to me when reading a book. I have to ""be"" there. English authors sometimes do this terribly well. I could not put this book down. Mystery and solution were proper. Mind didnt wander wondering why I was reading this as I did her last one. It's a good read, especially on a rainy or snowy day."
3,O.K. Continues to be stodgy...,"I love Roy Marsden as Dagliesh in the PBS series, butthe books are dull, even though the writing, yes, is very""good."" Maybe it's because I rarely, if ever, care ""whodunnit.""I find these mysteries rigged...it's not a matter of ""clues""but of the author's whim.Ho-hum. British ecclesiastical 'melodrama' - precious, tepid, somewhat depressing."
3,P D James movies on BBC better than books,"I've read several of P D James books. I thought I would like them more than the BBC movies because I usually want to know what characters are thinking. However James writes soooooo much detail in that respect it slows, almost stops, the story. OK, we do as readers get a real understanding of each person, but most of it does nothing to actually further the plot.I do say that she writes very good character description/understanding, but most readers of detective stories are not looking for literary writing."
3,I like Adam. but I like Reed more,"his is one of a series that has an interesting formula. The work falls in line with the others. I highly recommend a look at some other works based on ""Orders"" such as the Defenders of the Holy Grail, which tells of the Templars and the bloodline of JEsus, plus romance! This is summer reading at best and no one will confuse James with Shakespeare."
1,Death in Holy Orders,"P D James can still write an engaging tale, ample to engage the mind on a transatlantic flight. But this mystery is a failure.Indispensible for the genre is a plot that ""works""; that remains credible after the denoument. ""Death in Holy Orders"" visits all the possible villains and properly acquits them, but the chosen bad-guy is simply not credible as such; he has no motivation for a brutal murder. This story does not hang together.I was unable at Stockholm Airport to buy this from Amazon, alas; so I paid more than needed. And when I wrote Ms James c/o her publisher to request a refund, you'll be shocked to learn that she has in five weeks made me no reply whatever.It's no shame on any author, to be unable to produce consistent work at age 80. But for the sake of the reputation P D James has already established, she ought now to call it a day."
4,"Very good, as usual, but not one of her best","I have read and enjoyed all of P.D. James books so far. All have been quite good -- better than almost anyone else -- but this one is not among her two or three best, mainly because the ending is rather unsatisfying and abrupt. Still, it is a very good read and is recommended."
4,Beguiling Murders,"Ms. James cleverly navigates her readers through personal sins, management quandary, and society turmoil. Scores of secrets materialize in a minute community. With so many confusions introduced, one forgets that a clear motive might be an answer to any mysteries. Very cunning of Ms. James in weaving her tale and I applaud her in compelling me to think too deeply into matters all throughout the book. I do not understand the reasoning behind writing only one chapter for book four but Ms. James must have an experienced writer's artistic and logical answer in doing so. Ms. James' vibrant use of the English language together with her vast vocabulary results in a pleasurable read."
3,More Ho-Hum Than Holy,"I've read all of Dame James's Dalgliesh books and must say that I've found this the least interesting. The writing, as always, is wonderful, but the actual mystery is not. The bodies pile up, but so do the coincidences and unlikely twists. And why reveal the culprit so far in advance of the ending? I kept waiting for a final twist that never came. Not in any way a good intro to James."
2,wish I could give it a better review,"The writing was good, but the subject was dull. And didn't anyone else feel a little offended that at least three of the ""good guys"" thought that it was just a shame that poor Father John was being persecuted when all he had done was fondle a few choirboys - after all it wasn't like he raped them. While I might be willing to believe that one character - or even two - could be that backward in this day and age, would you really expect that from three of them, and two of those police officers? And Adam Dalgliesh gets less and less believable with every book - personally, I wish she'd write another Cordelia Gray book."
2,PDJ at her worst-not an inspired plot,"I love P D James normally and love her descriptive writing, but this plot was ridiculous. The murderer turns out to be a character with no real motive for the crime-actually none of the characters have much of a motive for the crime. Oh well...bad day for PDJ. Book held my attention, but mostly from the descriptions of the places and characters and the hope of a clever ending which unfortunately never materialized."
1,WRONG COLOR,"YOUR PICTURE DOES NOT REPRESENT THE BEDDING. I ORDERED 2 SETS EXPECTING THEM TO BE RED, AS THE PICTURE SHOWS.THEY CAME TO ME IN GOLD. I RETURNED THOSE, TALKED WITH 3 PEOPLE ABOUT THE PROBLEM, AND WAS SENT 2 MORE SETS IN GOLD! YOU NEED TO CHANGE THE PICTURE. THIS HAS CAUSED A LOT OF TROUBLE FOR ME. ALL 4 SETS HAVE BEEN RETURNED AND I STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED A REFUND. NO STARS FOR YOU."
4,I thought this was one of Cassie Edwards best books,"I could not put this book down, it was spellbinding to me. I enjoy most of Cassie's books and this was one of them. The caring and love of the characters was amazing"
4,Hard core reggae with a smooth twist!!,"Tanya comes of as patra with a better singing voice and the smae stamina, but not as sex-driven as patra. She does, however, put up some slamming hardcore dancehall beats as well as some mellow (tony rebel) grooves. She also puts some concious stuff on like ""2000 years"" and ""think it over"". Over all this is a good addition to your reggae collection. Tanya will become another reggae idol real soon."
5,One of the 'wickedest' female D.J.'s alive - Stay HOT!!!!!!!,"Very rarely do you find a woman who can mix: business, sexuality, 'vivrancy', and realness all in one album. She didn't leave the men out - which is all most women are concerned with. Bounty Killa ripped up the scene on the fourth track. I am so proud of Tanya Stephens. We may be the same age, I am in my early twenties, but she has a maturity level that will guide youths like me into a more positive direction. She doesn't take nonsense from anyone and makes the men 'bow -n- solute' her. I subscribe to that appeal. Women must realize that it is our time. As long as we rule, we may as well rule in our own favor. Tanya seems like a long time friend and I just think she represented herself exquisitely on the microphone. Keep going, sistren. Mi gwan make mi pickney listen to tunes like this when she old enough. Big up all Bashment crew. ONE (love)!"
5,classic,Hans Albers is a legend in Hamburg. This is a must have for anyone interested in old German nostalgia music.
5,DJ & Collectors' Delight,"What a wonderful job Gus Meade in putting this thing together. I wasn't fully sure what to expect, but the organization and thoroughness of the research makes this one of the most accessible books of discographical information ever printed. Yes, there are classification categories that I might have wanted to see used, but this is a minor cavil in the face of the all the ones that are used."
2,Broken wings on a Black Crow,Sounds like 2nd or 3rd rate b-side Black Crowes -Vocals and band are good but nothing special has been accomplished here.
1,Missed the Mark,"I found this band scoping the net for new music.The look of the band caught my eye and I was hoping a kick ass rock and roll band. Well it sounds pretty decent from the samples. Unfortunately, decent isn't good enough. It's very rehashed, formulaic and unoriginal. No balls. Sorry guys..maybe some better material will help? There a million bands who sound the same that are superior and this didn't stand out at all. good luck tho!"
2,SO-SO,If you try and forget that these guys sound like Poison oranother late 80's pop rock group this might be a decent listen.It seems like that with another round of boy band eras comingup we also got another load of hair bands coming along... Historysure does repeat it's self. Just take this for what it is andit is NOT a return to 70's rock.
1,HAHA,AWW PLEASEE?! ENGLAND'S GONNA HAVE TO DO BETTER THAN THIS IF WE WANNA BE BACK ON THE TOP OF THE ROCK AND ROLL MAP! cOME ON!? WHERE ALL THE GREAT BANDS. WE USED TO CHURN OUT THE BEST AND NOW WE GOT HURRICANE PARLOUR PARTY AND THE DARKNESS.THERES ONLY ONE GUD SONG ON THIS EP WHICH IS ROADSTAR AND I BET THEY DONT EVEN WRITE THEIR OWN SONGS. THEY LOOK LIKE SOME CRAPPY BOY BAND DRESSED UP TO LOOK LIKE ROCKERS. GNR ARE THE REAL DEAL!AXL WUD TAKE A GIANT SH** ON THESE GUYS
4,GREAT CD,"Like many others, I also heard ""Last Survivor"" on Dog The Bounty Hunter and liked it so much that I immmediately bought the CD. I would love to know when we can expect more from them or any tour information!"
2,Not bad.,"My mate lemme listen to this EP and I kinda liked it at first cuz it was a blend of alot of bands i liked. But after a while it just gets boring. The drummer I like loads cuz oif his pounding hard hitting style and the bassist works really well. I just wish there was more guitar work and the singer wasn't so annoying.Go and see the Gaga's, they're a much better band. I dunno how this lot stand up live tho. But there are plenty of better bands out there, like the mighty wildhearts!! WOOOT WOOOT"
2,Not that Hot.,Go.and ahead and buy the Roadstar cd Grand Hotel. You will be a lot happier. Pretty good band. Short life span.
3,"great book, poor quality","The essays of the book are so informative and useful for any scholar. I really enjoy reading this book but due to the poor and fancy typography, it makes me feel hard even reading a short paragraph. There are more than 450 color images in this book but unfortunately most of them; especially Courbet's paintings are out off focus. There are many full-page color images, one could hardly find the details of the artwork because they are blurred and dull. I would like to give 6 stars to the great texts but 2 stars for the poor quality of the printing. This book could be actually one of the best monographs on individual artist, But I think, the Met Museum owed too much to Courbet and all the contributors."
2,Not a great fit for Kindle,"My rating in no way reflects the content of the book--in fact, I haven't had the patience to fight through the formatting of the Kindle version. A table at the beginning of the book is not resizable on the Kindle, and the text is extremely small and faint (on an original Kindle). There's also a diagram that's not resizable. I can understand that about the diagram, but the table is just a timeline of fly fishing and rod technology--no pictures, just text. Worse, throughout the book's text, there are numerous unnecessarily hyphenated words that retain that hyphenation regardless of text size on the Kindle (for example, ""unneces- sarily"" or ""hy- phenated""). If this were a business memo I'd muddle through, but it's too unpleasant for light reading."
3,Well Written But Too Snobby For Most To Profit From,"The topic has started to catch my eye when I treat myself to a book on amazon. Bamboo rods really have a grasp on my interest in the sport right now. So, I bought this book with the intention of trying to further my awareness of these rods. Well, let me just say that the writing is great. It is unsurpassed within the world of fly fishing literature. However, the author's elitist attitudes did not really provide much of an insight into the world of bamboo rods, other than to recount how one person was able to use his credentials to make connections that others could not make. He met some great people and tells us of these meetings. Then the author engages in an ego boosting yarn about his rare and valuable rods he owns. That is about all that is in the book and why it does not really belong their with Gierach's book. It is up to you but there are other more enjoyable books on the subject."
2,"Hate to badmouth it, but...","This idea that Piers Anthony gives is great. Two worlds - one magic and one technological - is brilliant. The moment a friend told me about it, I went out and grabbed it. The book was also well written. I just couldn't stand the multiple-page long monologues Stile gives frequently. It seemed that every chapter Stile was giving some speech or another about morality or about how great he was at one thing or another. That's another thing that's not so great. I like having a hero who is really good at a few things, but it seemed that Stile was good at everything -riding horses, fighting, the Game, robots, even magic he picked up quickly. Heroes that are too good wind up too bad."
2,An average Scifi-Fanasy,"This book seemed to me to be too ordinary. It talks about him beating robots but all he is, is an ordinary jockey. He doesn't have special power that lets him beat up robots twice as powerful as him. I do have to admitt that it gets a little better when he goes though the curtain to the world Phaze. Basically what I am trying to say is that the book has the good essentials to be a story but it lacks the final touch ups. The book has no real excitment, I would advise you read books like The Hobbit by JRR Tolien, The Eye of the World by Robert Jordan, The Wizard's First Rule by Tery Goodkind, or books by Robert E. Feist."
5,For all those Shannara and Deathgate fans...,"I've been an avid sci-fi/ fantasy reader for as long as I can remember. Just a word to anyone that thinks mages, Orcs, and dragons are somewhere out there, give this series a try. Imaginative, riveting, and just plain cool, these books make you want to start looking for a shield to will yourself through. It's something every self-willed machine dreams for and every 'corn, werewolf, and Adept live for."
4,"Rife with action, but lacking literary polish.","My first exposure to Anthony's work came in the 8th grade, whereupon I tore through the Apprentice Adept, Incarnations of Immortality, Xanth, and Bio of a Space Tyrant series, as well as many stand-alone novels. Since then, I have reread most of his works every five years or so. I find that, as I age, the personal politics Anthony has littered not-so-discretely through his novels increasingly overshadows the story he's telling. That I continue to read the Apprentice Adept series, while Bio of a Space Tyrant makes me too angry to continue past Refugee, is a credit to the fantastic and exciting world Anthony has created. However, those seeking enlightened, mellifluous prose should prepare to be disappointed"
2,"First in the Adept series, and shows it.","Split Infinity runs its course on the merit of its premise. It lacks some of the refinement that Piers' other novels display. If you like his other works, than this novel is for you. It is also obviously the required reading for the rest of the Adept series"
5,"Man, this book is so throwed!!!","Split Infinity!! I read it a couple years ago and loved it. I had to come back for a second go round know what I'm saying!! Huh, this book here goes to hard in the paint. What's wrong with that boy Anthony, do'in it like that. Check this out. Man, this book will put it all in ya face."
3,"Fun story , shallow characterizations","I read the whole series and enjoyed it. The characters were shallow. The hero of the story was perfect and I probably would have worshiped these books if I was 14 years old. The hero conquers all; gets the chicks etc. It is campy adolescent fantasy, but it's also a fun easy read. I would recommend if you just got through reading a space opera and need a break."
5,My favorite book and series of all time,Split infinety has a little of everything. From science fiction to fantasy. It even has some romance mixed in. I suggest it to anyone that loves science fiction/fantasy and already hasnt read it to deffinatly give it and the whole series a read.
3,Wonders abound!,"Anthony seems most at home with settings he can completely create from scratch. He is always entertaining, and this book is no exception. The theme is predictable(a normal man, the underdog, discovers hidden powers and becomes the beloved hero). Knowing how things will end gives you no clues about the ride there, however. Anthony's talent for conveying his seemingly boundless imagination to paper is on full display here. This book is absolutely enjoyable. The reader is fully immersed in Anthony's worlds, and is therefore able to completely escape our own for awhile."
1,Crosman 760 is cheap,"The Crosman 760 with Starter kit, is weak and feels cheap.The BB/Pellet loading bolt is lose fitting.The accuracy is lacking.The laser sight is a plastic toy.This is not the Crosman I grew up shooting...Save your money and buy a different BB/Pellet gun."
4,When the World was Fresh and Traveling a Pleasure,"Tired of crowded planes, sitting alongside of intolerable neighbors, having eaten tasteless meals served by pushy stewardesses, well, read this book to see what was the world like when mass and world travel was just beginning. Not a care in the world. The book describes what was it like to have no TSA and no passport requirements for traveling far and away. Written in a swift prose, Paul Fussell's book is real literature and with a long sentence like 'He who travel fastest travels alone, to be sure, but he who travels best travels with a companion if not always a lover' your curiosity will take you through descriptions of places and things that only your grandmother can remember. This book is a joy and is also great way to brush up on your British literature."
3,Everything okay,What else is there to say?Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah
2,next year in cuba,"I read this book in the summer of 2002, i found the author's experience similar to mine. i wish that i can get in contact with him at a later date. the book was very emotional because our struggle to see our land free is far from over. i loved this book."
1,This is garbage,"I purchased this with my DS light, it is all in the garbage now --The screen protectors, the tape that is on them will not come off, I tried water, a razor rubbing alcohal and goof off, (the last wrecked em).The headphones are cheap and get tangled easy, that is when they dont retract into thmselves when using them.I am afraid to use the car charger -- dont want to break my ds."
1,not happy,I purchased a Nintendo and then thought I was getting the starter kit for it but it was for the lite Nintendo so we do not have a starter kit for the regular Nintendo and have no use for the lite starter kit. My daughter tossed the packaging for it so I can not return it!!
1,no cd,"I have buyed this cd and pay it with pay pal but a few days later the seller has let me know that he couldent send this cd because he saw thatthe cd was broken,so i have received a mesage that he would give me my money back, i've didn't got the money back at this moment,but i'll hope the amount is back on my next visa billgreating martin"
5,Cute frog,I bought this frog to use in my classroom because I'm using a frog theme. The kids love to take turns holding it. It is real soft and is we made.
4,Amazon Store shipping,Received this with the bubble pack stapled together like a bad return and bolts and nuts were not the original Holley items. Once I found the missing bolts and nuts in the box they shipped it in I was able to use this part but was not happy with the Amazon store for sending a reboxed part.
5,An excellent guide to healing after abortion.,"This book is about Jennifer O'Neill's abortion and the path she has followed since her abortion to find emotional and spiritual resolution. The book includes shorter stories about the experiences of a number of other women. Readers who have had abortions will find themselves able to identify with these stories. Jennifer O'Neill also talks about the steps that are important in healing after abortion, and about the <a href=""http://www.silentnomoreawareness.org"">Silent No More Awareness Campaign</a>, which is a group of women speaking in public about their own abortions in order to raise public awareness about the negative emotional aftermath of abortion.This book is a pleasure to read, comforting, informative, and well-written."
5,Excellent book,Everyone needs to read this book. It will open your eyes to the many women who are hurting from abortion.
3,"Worked for me, here is how.","I was able to use this to read and write _Phone Book_ entries to SIM cards from 2 different types of GSM cell phones. The CD-ROM provided was labled USB 2.0, it contained an application named SimCardRead.exe and some DLLs. I did NOT have to install any drivers (Windows 2000 Pro), Windows recognized the adapter as a removable mass storage device and did not ask for drivers.I ran SimCardRead.exe directly off of the CD-ROM. Documentation on CD-ROM is weak.Biggest headache was that SimCardRead.exe will truncate Phone Book names to 13 characters each when writing to SIM cards, although longer names can be read from the SIM cards."
3,Probably for the advanced user,It works fine for me but I have to re-install the drivereach time I insert the device. Just browse to the theCD Rom when directed to find the driver.JP
1,1 star only 'cause there is a Zero star selection,It did not work. Do not waste your money. Wish I could get my money back.
3,Its an ok item but does not download all you expect from your simcard,It did not read all the numbers/names in my simcard as I expected it to do (as advertised)
1,Absolute junk.,"This product absolutely does not work. It has Windows 98 drivers, bad (none) directions. I also happened to have a win98 HP system I just reset to factory defaults with a clean OS. NONE of the apps worked, multiple drivers on the CD, bad english, and constantly rebooting/locked system. Anyone selling this product should think about the integrity of their business. What a joke."
1,"Conveniently ""Lost"" My Order","I ordered mine back in July anticipating a cell phone change. Mine didn't work either. XP seems to want to view it as a drive and doesn't allow their software to detect it.Emailed them asking if they had updated downloads:""Please also send us your order no. so that we can assist you better.""I sent them the order number and date:""Thank you for your email. However, your order no. does not match our records.""I tried free driver downloads from three competing products and nothing worked. I'm sure if you could stop XP from detecting it as a drive, their poorly written software might work. I tried many different sequences of uninstalling it in Hardware Manager, running the software, rebooting and reinstalling the device with no success.I believe this device was made for a very specific application/situation and should not have been sold en masse to the public."
1,AWFUL PRODUCT! DEFECTIVE MANUAL! DEFECTIVE SOFTWARE! DEFECTIVE DEVICE!,"I have purchased hundreds of products on Amazon, and this is the worst! The price was great, and, of course, it was too good to be true. I purchased five of these, thinking my friends would love them. The manual is a small piece of paper that refers to an install directory that doesn't exist (and also assumes that your CD-ROM is your ""G"" drive). The set-up drivers were referred to as being for a device with a serial port, and this is supposed to be a USB device! The SIM card could not fully seat in the device. Of course, the device could not be seen by my computer. I was just thankful that this piece of junk did not trash my SIM card, and cause me to lose all of my addresses. I found this item elsewhere on the internet as a closeout, I think someone is just trying to dump some worthless junk. This is my first negative review of a product on eBay. People deserve to be warned about this product."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY !!!,Would not install on 3 different Windows computers. No drivers on Windows XP CD nor Internet. Possible fishing lure!
1,"Might *possibly* work with Win98 but not XP, Vista","As far as I've gotten in driver installation on an XP laptop and Vita desktop, the drivers will install only to a Win98 system. Nothing available on the web as an upgraded driver. Forget this one."
1,DOES NOT WORK_RIP OFF_DO NOT BUY,Software provided does not work. Can not find any helpful info on web except that lots of other people bought and can not use this item either.DO NOT BUY
4,Works once you figure it out,Serial 7891 My reader came with a small cd.. here is what I did...You need to install the contents of the Usb-SIM9.0 folder that comes on the cd as well as Usb-232\HL0108\ Hugepine setup (Hugepine allows your computer to read the usb card as a serial port. Com 3 worked for me. Happy hunting
4,Idiosyncratic,"This disc is very well done, but it is odd and takes some getting used to. Slam Stewart and Major Holley HUM ALONG to the bass, an octave apart. Be warned--but give it a chance."
3,Aging but Still Great,"Medium Terzett, a group hailing from Germany who saw their prime in the 60s by singing nonsensical polka, folk, and rock songs, prove that they still know how to entertain a crowd and sing a good song with their record ""unsere groessten hits"". Although not as great as the album ""Kilometerstein"", it still has some high points. Check out the live recording of ""wer hat die kokosnuss geklaut"", they add some more surf rock esque vocals to spice it up a bit, along with a humerous live version of their hit ""ein loch ist im eimer"". All in all it is a decent album, and a must have for any die hard Terzett fans, however, if you are just getting into the band (or dont like live CDs like me) then I recommend trying to get your hands on the album ""Kilometerstein""."
5,"A must have for the true, blue, wrestling fan","I recently bought this book, and after reading it, I think its the best WWE book ever. It gives you an inside look on what the Superstars are really like, and how they travel day to day. Some of the superstars discuss how they broke through the doors of the WWE, and what thier home life is like. The bottom line is, this is definatly a MUST HAVE for the true wrestling fan :)"
4,Unscripted really is scripted,"But it's not a bad read for a cold rainy day. The photos are of high quality. Some of the diva photos are from a WWE Divas magazine shoot. The interviews are pretty good. If you are a new fan, or casual fan (like me) it's a nice present. If you're a photography buff, it's neat also. But I'm glad I didn't pay list price."
3,A Night to Remember,"7 years ago, Georgia slipped into Jason's room and they had one night of passion. 7 years later, they're reunited by the death of their stepfather. Georgia has grown up, she used to be this chubby teenager that had no cofidence and no self-esteem. Now she's a confident and beautiful woman. Jason is determined to find out what happened to their baby, because he knew Georgia was pregnant even if that meant following her everywhere and spending time with her everyday and night.I didn't really enjoy MISTRESS FOR A NIGHT because there was too much miscommunication and there wasn't any happy moments throughout the book. It was really depressing until the very last moment but by that time it ruined my whole mood.^_^ ~ Izzy"
5,Metal at it's best.,"Alexi does the best job of guitar solos with high distortion that I've ever heard! The song Lost, Trashed, and Strungout is my favorite, and the CD is definately a must for me, and any other COB fan! 5 stars (6 in my book but amazon.com won't let me)!"
4,This is a good series..,"This series is well crafted in true Tsui Hark style. What a pity it isn't complete. However this was a 40 episode series, but the dvd's only give us 39. Thus we end the series with our swordsmen setting off to deal with Duo Gedou but we never find out if they accomplished it, whether Yang finds Min Hui and whether she goes to Mount Heaven with him and her daughter. The whole thing left me frustrated, after becoming totally immersed in the characters, just too many loose ends."
5,Satisfied,I really enjoy the Seven Swordsmen Series. Excellant scenes and the story keeps me intriged through out. Right now on disc 5 and looking forward to 6.
3,No Ending,"No ending! A decent example of its genre, up to the end of episode 39 which ends in a cliffhanger. Then, no episode 40! The last few episodes were stuck repeating the same themes, as though the screenwriters were trying to stretch out the series. The movie version is nearly as satisfying and has an ending, if not a final conclusion."
2,"Looks great, but does not work with Visual Basic","Comment 3/28/11:Bought this unit so I could use RS232 to control using VB. Hyperterminal works only if you use the \r as the EOL terminating character. By default the EOL character is \n. However, I could not send text to the unit. I tried terminating text commands with vbCr, then vbCrLf, et al... and nothing worked. I saw the unit connected to the serial port, however.I sent several emails to the company tech support, and no one responded.I am initiating a refund."
2,Does not fit all CR-Vs,"I bought this bike rack because I was looking for something to use on my 2004 Honda CR-V. The photograph shows this rack mounted on a CR-V, so I thought I was in luck. It turns out, however, the design of the CR-V tailgate varies a lot from year to year and this rack would not mount on the spare tire of the 2004 version without destroying the rear wiper. Thus I returned it."
4,Seems like a good product.,I got it so I could take my mountain bike along when I go camping with my very small (11foot) travel trailer. The trailer has a rear mounted spare tire holder. Seems like a good product.
3,Doesn't work on all spare tires,"I purchased this rack for my 2007 Toyota Rav4, which has a rear mounted spare tire.Unfortunately the Rav4 spare tire mounts onto a metal bracket. That bracket effectively blocks the strap that is supposed to run vertically behind the tire. Although I was able to jury rig it to basically work, I did not feel comfortable with the end product as it definitely didn't provide a firm attachment to the tire.I returned it and purchased theSaris B.A.T. 2-Bike Spare Tire Rack, which has its own considerable problems but I did manage to eventually make it work."
3,Did not fit Wrangler with 3rd brake light.,"I purchased this rack in part because of past experiences with Yakima. The previous trunk mount rack I had from them worked great. The Spare Joe was of similar quality as well and for vehicles that it can be properly mounted to, it appeared to be a very good rack. Unfortunately I was not able to have the rack seat correctly on the spare of my 2005 Jeep Wrangler because of the 3rd brake light. I also have a 30"" spare. If a smaller spare was mounted it may work, but I'm not sure. I ended up getting the Thule spare tire rack and am very happy with it. It does not mount around the tire, so the 3rd brake light is not an issue."
4,Yakama bike rack for Honda CRV,"Looks flimsy but works good. Bike centered well on back eventhough right side spare tire (20"" and 16"" frames). Would be less flimsy looking on spare tires that are normal tire size."
1,Yakima Spare Joe 2-Bike Spare Tire Mount Rack,"A Disappointing purchase that I had to return. Although online readers' commentaries claimed otherwise, this bike rack does NOT fit a Honda CRV 2003. The rack rests too high against the rear window; too high and too close to be able to get the straps behind the spare tire."
4,Works as well as can be expected,"This bike rack works just fine on my '99 CR-V. It goes on quickly, comes off even quicker and is easy to store. However, any rack that must rely totally on holding onto the spare tire makes me a bit nervous. Would I feel comfomrtable taking two bikes on a long trip? No. But I just use it to take my own bike a few miles from home to the trail now and then. For that sort of use, it is perfect."
3,BZ Rubbers-Stiff foot pockets,"I bought a pair of these fins eight years ago when I started bodyboard surfing, and I don't like them very much.BZ Rubbers Body Board FinsMaybe it's the shape of my foot, but I wouldn't recommend these unless you can borrow or rent a pair and spend a couple hours in them before you make your purchase. I tend to spend a couple hours out on the waves and the fins worked okay, but I was getting sores on top of my feet where the fins rubbed against them, (I was wearing neoprene sox/booties and a large size fin). The fins are made out of a stiff rubber which is okay for the fin blades, but the foot pockets are not very comfortable in the long run unless your foot is the right shape."
3,fins,fast deliver on the size they send medium size and didn't specifi the size by the time of the purchase I buogth this for my son so I'm not and espert on it.
3,Purchase of book: Cars of Pacific Electric: Volume 1 City & Suburban Cars (Interurbans Special 28),"The book was in good condition, however the packaging was woeful, and it arrived in a damaged condition. In contrast to other books I have purchased from Amazon, the pacakging was the worst I have seen."
1,Bad Book,"This texbook was required for my Dynamics class, and I don't know why. To me, this book is absolutely terrible, and there were MANY typos and errors in presenting examples. Some of the problems even had INCORRECT solutions on the back of the book. I found at least 10 cases of this happening. When presented with this, I wrote to the publisher and they never even responded. What a terrible book with matching customer service on the publisher's part!"
1,This book was so poorly done!,"I was utterly disappointed with this textbook. The explanations were meager, at best, and did not help me understand the book. In my opinion, A very good textbook is one in which the student is virtually able to ""teach him/herself"" the material in the book without a professor. This book was apparently not written for that. Not only were explanations lacking, but derivations were hard to follow (skipped too many steps),.. Example problems existed but they were no help whatsoever for the extremely difficult problems at the end of each chapter. Worthless investment. I am trying to find a dynamics book that I can actually follow."
1,Just Awful,"Much like McGill and King's Statics book, there is very little substance to the book. It seems more like a work book then a textbook, and for the price i paid for it, i expect a text book."
1,"Without a good professor, this book is just awful","I am using this book as a Georgia Tech Aerospace Engineering Dynamics requirement, and that is the only reason. The content is just awful. Nothing is explained. Each chapter has 4-5 examples of various problems and 2-3 pages of actual content writing, then just a ton of problems to work on. Avoid if you can and if needed, just hope for a great professor."
1,Pray you have a good teacher,"If you don't, you're in for a world of trouble with this book. Examples given are not at all helpful in discerning the fundamentals of statics."
2,Birdy Squiggles Bird Toys,I was very disappointed in this product. When they arrived they were smashed and stuck to the cardboard packaging them came in. That aside my birds have no interest in them whatsoever. I would stick with wood or acrylic toys in the future.
2,Melted and Sticky,"The product arrived looking like it had been slightly melted by heat and stuck together. I spent some time pulling em apart, afterward i washed it in plain water (even though it says dishwasher safe) and hoped it would stop being so sticky. It was still as sticky,did not at all look safe and seemed like very bad quality. Im going to have to return it as defective."
5,My Parrotlet Loves them--,Crazy bird has been sleeping in the pink squiggly thing.I tell him it's time for bed and he squeezes himself into it.Too funny!!The other hangy isn't a favorite of his.He prefers loud bells.Mama likes that one better.P.S. I'm mama!
4,Easy Does It Cart,"This cart is an excellent size for what I use it for, but it's just a little more bamby than I expected. I would love to have regular rubber wheels instead of the plastic ones, but I guess that's the sacrifice you make for a low price.The seller was excellent to work with and shipped very quickly."
3,"Very usefull garden cart, but has a weak part","I enjoyed using this cart a couple of years. Easy to assemble, mostly made of plastic, rustproof it needed no maintenance, Looks like it was well made and practically indistructible, until the time that the plastic part with a screw that connects the holder below and the front wheel broked when I was pulling while turning around in a wet grass surface. The load was less than a hundred pounds. I should have been more careful when turning the cart in a wet grass surface. If you will only use this cart on a smooth surface and follow it's limitation then it should serve you for a long time. I hope the designer of the part involved can do some changes in the future. In the mean time, I'll see if I can fix mine using an epoxy putty. Hope this helps."
5,gardeb=n cart,This cart is a heaven sent I use it carring all my gardening supplies to my garden and it is great for carring Potting soil and other garden bags used in the garden. This is very light weight to use.
4,Nice little cart,"I am not a handy-man type, so for me, it took a little time and effort to put the thing together, mainly the wheels. But eventually, I got it. The cart came with an extra six small metal disks., I am not sure what these little metal pieces were for, so I was a bit confused at first. I did use everything in the instructions, so I know I didn't leave anything out.Got to be careful when using the side rails and upper deck. It will be top heavy. I learned this after I dumped a load of potting soil, as I was going around an uneven area on my yard.For the price, it's fine. I would not pay more, however. If you want something for heavy-duty loads, get something sturdier."
4,A great accessory for American girl doll as well as our Generation dolls.,"My Daughter received this for Xmas and it has been fun with her American girl Doll, I agree with a previous review that it is a GREAT alternative to the highly priced American Girl similar accessories. I believe it is pretty durable, while the black handgrips pop out easily, it is not a hinderance. My 2 Year old plays with it a lot as well and he has not damaged it in anyway."
3,fun without the American Girl cost,"I bought this for my 9 year old who is really into American Girl dolls. She saw this in a Target store, but when we went back they no longer stocked them. I paid a little more on Amazon to get it,but she has really enjoyed it and has ridden her AG dolls, stuffed animals and even Barbies around on it. I am really glad I got this for her for Christmas. The Our Generation line of doll accessories is a nice,affordable alternative to the AG doll line."
2,He is Rather Whiny,"I'm a fangirl for boy love & the Arthurian legends but the whole first half of the book Mordred is whining about being unable to have sex. I was disappointed by the lack of storyline & Mordred's egerness to find a man. It was to much of a fanfiction for me, glad others enjoyed it though."
3,Definitely Different,"I liked seeing a heroic well-meaning Mordred who is gay. I liked the psychic phenomena called vesseling and raveling. I was glad to see that this Arthurian tale was myth centered rather than making another dubious attempt to cram the myth into real world history. On the other hand, I didn't like the fact that the only strong sympathetic female character was the Lady of the Lake, and I thought the book ended on an uninspiring note."
3,Boring,"As a fan of Arthurian stories and a gay man I was looking forward to this retelling of the legend of Mordred, Arthur, etc. While Clegg gives us some interesting ideas, I was never really captured by the story. At the end I was left feeling rather ho hum about the story, and not at all interested in seeing where book 2 and 3 would take the story."
5,Wonderful.,"I found this to be a beautifully written, very poetically styled novel and I was hooked from the very start. The employment of the third person narrative for prologue and epilogue worked extremely well as brackets to the meat of the novel in the first person. Mordred is a highly sympathetic and likeable character and the twists on Arthurian legend and the idea that Arthur was not the shining king of wonder and sparkly rainbows that historians/mythologians tend to portray him as was very refreshing.I thoroughly enjoyed this novel and had a moment near the end of 'uhoh' when Mordred ruminated on why Merlin did not want Lancelot to go with Mordred to save Guinevere. I sense dark times and sadness ahead for our anti-hero. For that is what Mordred is in this novel, and I cannot wait for the second part of this wonderful trilogy."
3,Not so floppy,"This toy is cute and a little floppy but not as floppy/understuffed / and cuddly as I expected from the name ""flopsie"" the Mary Meyer flip flops are much floppies and with little bean bag type material. Much better in my mind. This does seem sturdy and well made though and has a cute face, just not that floppy."
4,Great gift,"I got this for my little nephew and it arrived quickly and my nephew loves it. It was just the right size, not too big or too small."
2,Tastes fake,"This syrup is OK, but it tastes less realistic than I expected. It has sort of a overly sweet, artificial flavor. I prefer the Cinnamon and Vanilla syrups."
1,BEWARE! Not the usual 3 bottles!,"I've been ordering these Torani (American) syrups for about 6 months, sampling various sugar-free (Splenda) flavors and enjoying the additional flavors with my fresh brewed, fresh ground Bialetti 'mocca' coffee. So, imagine my surprise when I opened the Amazon box today and found a SINGLE bottle (at $17+! which is the usual price for THREE at 750mL).To add further grief, when I called in to get the return label and voice my dismay that the difference between the usual THREE and this SINGLE was not obvious, I got a non-USA Customer Service Rep who literally took 6 minutes to initiate the email with the necessary return label AFTER my account and the order had been established! THIS IS ***not*** THE SERVICE LEVEL I HAVE COME TO EXPECT FROM AMAZON."
2,Weird flavor,"I like a lot of the other sugar free flavored but this one has a strange after taste that I really didn't care for very much. Also, it didn't mention it but this is a glass bottle and I really wasn't a fan of that. A big heavy glass bottle in my house can get broken pretty easily, I had assume it would be plastic because every one I ordered always has been."
4,Sugar Free Tastiness,"Having run into difficulty keeping track of which Torani Sugar Free I enjoy, adding Amazon reviews seemed like a good way to keep track, share the experience and not loose a piece of paper with the choices.That said, Torani Sugar Free English Toffee has become one of my standards after a couple bad experiences choosing the wrong versions of caramel and hazelnut (Classic or regular). To me, this English Toffee tastes less like good toffee and more like a good flavored sweetener - definitely drinkable but less than amazing."
1,Snore-fest,"There is a reason that this CD is going for one cent. Tired lyrics and musically unimaginative, this album wasn't terrible, but it wasn't even worth the cost of postage to find that fact out. A band that only a friend of the band could love."
4,A Guide To Proper Usage Of Spoken Chinese: Simplified Chinese Edition,"when i have read it, i think that it's quite good. it is easily to understand because of in this book had been given the example sentences in the english language and comparative with Chinese Language. At last, very usuful for by self study."
1,The Reviewers have GOT to be her friends,I bought the first two books based on the glowing reviews. I agree with the What Am I Missing Reviewer. They were poorly written and I could not even stand to finish the first one. The reviews are obviously a set up and a great disservice to people who actually buy these books. Please show us a review from a national source.
5,I am so hooked on this series!,I am so hooked on the Lambert series! I have had three visits to Murray's pretend island paradise and I cannot tell you how anxious I am to make the final journey! I think this firstime writer did a super job in tying everything altogether. Each book takes up exactly where the one before ended without missing a beat. I find that impressive. I hope Ms. Murray will continue to write more books in the romantic suspense category. She is a natural born writer in my opinion.
5,And the beat goes on...,"Murray keeps on keepin' on with her four book Lambert series. Whether she is including oldie's song lyrics or steamy sex scenes, she has a gift for writing a series...the retelling is not laborious and the characters keep your interest in their struggles and triumphs. Two thumbs way up! And the beat goes on..."
5,Romance with a twist!,Friendly Enemies by Victoria Taylor Murray is a romance novel with a twist. I had such a good time following Nouri and Gabe from page to page. I look forward to the final book of the Lambert series with much eagerness! If romance with a twist is your bag then this is one book you won't want to miss!
5,What a man!,"Boston Homicide Detective, Gabe Baldwin, is one of my favorite charactrs in this fun writer's BESTSELLING Lambert Series and for a very good reason--He's Man, All Man!I love the on again off again rounds of lust and temptation he is forced to endure because of the beautiful billionaire, Nouri St. Charles Sommer.The action is exciting and the on going plot will have you begging for more before the reader reaches the end of the book. Take my word for it this is one sexy, exciting, thrilling romantic/suspense soap opera you won't want to miss!"
5,"And the lucky winner is,","So many men and so little time will Gabe Baldwin be the man Nouri chooses in the end? Can't wait to find out in the final book of Victoria Murrays' Lambert Series!I think Gabe and Nouri would make the perfect couple but after Nouri's husband is shot and killed inside a museum in China will that force Nouri back into the arms of Clint Chamberlain?I am curiously wondering what the outcome will be. Will Nouri give her heart to Gabe Baldwin, Charles Mason, or Clint Chamberlain?Just received the last book in this series today and cannot wait to start on it later this evening! I'll be back to let you know!"
1,Seeded Reviews?,"I have not read these books, but it is rare for a book to get so many reviews and have an overall 5 star rating, so I thought I'd check it out. Then I noticed something fishy - I'm not making it up - check it out for yourself: Most (not all) of the reviews use the same basic language and grammar. Most of them mention the word ""series"" in the first sentence, ""characters"" in the second, and the last sentence ends with one to three exclamation marks ""!!!"". Also, they don't say anything about the plot of the book, and they have about the same number of helpful votes (30-50). All this is very suspicious to me, and then comes along a review that says they bought the book because of all the 5 star ratings and then found the book to be awful and even contained many spelling errors. Did the same person write these using different names? It looks that way to me. Based on all this I decided to skip this one."
5,"Compelling, sensual, very exciting!","FRIENDLY ENEMIES #3 IN THE LAMBERT SERIES was compelling, sensual, and very exciting! But don't take my word for it read it for yourself and you be the judge. I'm a fan!!!"
5,"What an interesting week for Nouri Sommers,","What a wonderful story! I was glued to my sofa for most of the evening just to finish this story, which by the way is so cool! I am having a good time trying to keep up with everything that is going on in the life of the heroine. What an interesting week she has endured so far! Yikes! Can't wait for the next in the series!!!"
5,this book made me a fan...,what fun i have had going from book to book with ms. murray's exciting lambert series. i have one last visit to lambert (book 4) and i can hardly contain my excitment to see how it all plays out...
5,Even men will love this sexy series!,My husband and I read this writer's Lambert series together and we had a ball! The sex scenes sizzle and the plot was thrilling. Paul and I cannot wait for Ms. Murray's next book to come out. We have become fans!
5,Super Fun Series!,What a trip! I'm having such a super time reading this super-fun series. Can't wait to finish it! The plot is great!!!
1,very disappointed,"The photos of the Forte sculpted towel bars look very nice but we got some 24"" and 30"" ones for our new master bathroom and they all have problems with the connection between the main section of the rod and the end pieces. None of them have the nice continuous smooth curve you see in the photos. They all have little gaps at the joints that I expect to snag things like terry towels. Maybe it's how our contractor did the installation, but one is even bent a little at one end (they're going to replace it). I haven't used these as towel rods yet, if they snag as much as I expect then I'll be looking for a replacement fairly soon."
2,Great Band. Bad Movie.,"Of all the video documents of U2, none is more frustrating to watch than Rattle and Hum. The camera never seems to be in the right place at the right time. It's as if director Phil Joanou never heard of U2 and decided to make a film of them anyway. He seems to get carried away with art of film making instead of the art of U2. From the botched, boring interviews to the artifice of using grainy, black and white film, Rattle and Hum is just wrong. Near the end of the picture and for no particular reason, we have color.At least the audio is high quality and nothing can detract from U2's excellent performances. It would have been more interesting to see a full, unedited concert from the Joshua Tree tour rather than this not so ""art"" film.Better U2 films: Popmart (although also visually annoying, the energy and setlist is far better), Elevation (perhaps the best), or ZooTv (for the sheer scale of the event).[DW]"
2,Blu-Ray versus VHS video,I can not see any difference in quality between this Blu-ray version and the VHS video version i have.
5,Brilliant,"As a high school student that is essentially bored with the regular, ho-hum classes that my school offers, this book is perfect. It gives a problem-solving foundation for math enthusiasts desiring to compete nationally in contests like the AMC, AIME, and USAMO. The problems are excellent and cover a wide range of difficulty (past ASHMEs, USAMOs, and, finally, IMOs); and the solutions are well-written, logical, and intelligible. In short, if you are looking to ""get better"" at problem solving, this is the book for you.Note: I also bought Problem-Solving Strategies by Arthur Engle. Those, perhaps more advanced, problem-solvers that want even more of a challenge should purchase this book as well (as both books give very challenging problems, but Engel's is undoubtedly more advanced)."
3,An.. OK.. Guide For A Great Game!,"Eh.. i regret buying this guide. For one thing, Almost everything in the game is randomized. Dungeons, Items, Jobs, etc. So all this guide gives you are vague descriptions of the way the game works, and maps that are ALREADY INCLUDED IN THE GAME. There aren't many tips or suggestions on how to raise your beasts, or what combos are effective (which i felt would've really been useful for the walkthrough) Also, there aren't any pictures of the divine beasts (which irritated me) and here's the worst.. plot spoilers! Ahh!Now this guide really isn't rotten.. this game is just the sort that in execution, a guide really isn't effective. There are some mildly useful tips, item lists, and boss strategies, but that's it."
5,"Great band- not to be confused with the other ""fight""","The Fight is an amazing punk band, bringing very fresh, addictive music to the genre. They formed in 2000, released their first EP, Home is Where The Hate Is, and now this is their first full-length album. It is awesome. The songs really get stuck in your head, in a good way. Revolution Calling stands out as a favorite of mine.IMPORTANT!!!: Amazon lists this band simply as ""Fight"", and lists them as having several other albums. all of the other, older albums are by a completely DIFFERENT BAND, an early 90's metal band simply called ""fight."" Don't buy the wrong CD because of this sloppy mistake in cataloging. Home is Where The Hate Is is the first CD by The Fight. Anything older than that is by the other band.If you like punk music, check this band out. They're awesome. You can listen to some of their songs and go to their official site from purevolume.com"
5,Nothing New Since Rock 'N' Roll Is Awesome!,"Nothing New Since Rock 'N' Roll is like the biography of my life. I found out about The Fight on Kerrang TV, where I saw the video and called in to vote like a hundred times. I bought the cd and couldn't believe how many awesome tracks there were. I recommend jb's, revolution calling and karaoke star if you're feeling like some fun, but there are also tons of other tracks, like no more legend, that are lesser known but are absolutely incredible. I totally recommend you get a copy. This is the coolest band I have found in a long time. They are the real deal...I saw them live in Manchester and they killed! This is a great album, sincere in the lyrics and wildly catchy in the melodies."
3,Teacup Full Of Roses by Sharon Bell Mathis,"I think the book Teacup Full Of Roses is a good book it puts you in the spot of a black family that doesn't make enough to get the things they want but still strive to get what they can. This book also shows how teens face every day problems if its either in the streets at home or even in school. The main characters in this book are Mom, Dad, Joe, Davey, Paul and his girlfriend. My favorite character is Joe because i see my self a lot like him. I have two younger brothers that look up to me and i think its my job to help them in anyway i can. But taking care of my bothers that aren't angels and having problems in school and also at home at times i just feel like leaving the planet. But like Joe i stay focused and control my self."
4,EMOTIONAL AND EXCITING,"I LIKED THIS BOOK BECASUE YOU WOULD HAVE NEVER EXPECTED WHAT HAPPENED TO HAPPEN. AT FIRST IT DESCRIBES THE SITUATION THAT THE FAMILY IS LIVING IN AND GETS US FAMILIAR WITH EVERYONES PERSONALITY'S. THEN BEGAN THE PARTS OF THE STORY WHERE IT SEEMED INTERESTING. IT SHOWED US THE MANY HARD WAYS A PERSON CAN LIVE THEIR LIFE, AND YET NOT GIVE UP. IT HAD MANY SAD SIDES TO IT WHICH WILL MAKE YOU VERY EMOTIONAL. I FEEL THAT THIS BOOK HAS A LOT TO TEACH, AND MANY EXPERIENCES TO LEARN FROM. I WOULD DEFINITLY RECOMD THIS BOOK TO EVERYONE."
4,Such a sad ending....,"I really enjoyed this book. Not only was it clear, but also understandable and an enjoyable book. I can recommend it to anybody of any age. It's a fast paced book that can take at the most of 3 hours; but not because it's short, but because it's so good you can't put it down! The events are realistic and anybody can relate to them. Very good book!"
4,Student from Prosser C.A.,"Teacup Full of Roses by Sharon Bell Mathis is a good book. This book is kind of sad! Joe is the middle child, his older brother Paul could paint but he pumps drugs into his arm. Joe's younger brother Davey is smart and could play basketball, and Joe is trying to help Davey succeed while their mother is always trying to help Paul. Joe's father is sick and his Aunt Lou could tell that something bad would happen by looking into her black bag. Joe could tell stories and he works hard to graduate, but something sad happens at the end. I recommend anyone to read Teacup Full of Roses."
5,A Teacup Full Of Roses,"I think the book is really good. It has the problems of every day life in the black communities. The book tells people about drugs, family problems, education,and gangs.All togther I really recommend the book for other people."
4,teacup full of roses,THIS BOOK WAS VERY ENTERTAINING. IT WAS VERY SAD BUT IN A GOOD WAY. IF YOU READ THIS BOOK BELIEVE ME YOU WOULD NEVER WANT TO PUT IT DOWN. I COULD READ THIS BOOK OVER AND OVER AGAIN BECAUSE IT KEEPS YOU IN SUSPENSE.
3,Teacup Full Of Roses by Sharon Bell Mathis,"I think Teacup full Of Roses was a good book because it puts you in the spot of a black family that doesn't make a lot but strives to get what they can. It also shows a lot in how teens stroggle in life if its either with drugs,problems at home or even problems at school.The main characters in the book are Mom, Dad, Joe, Davey, Paul and his girlfriend. My favorite character in this book is Joe because i think hes a lot like me. Because I two younger brothers and i think its my job to help them out in anything i can. But at some points with me taking care of my brothers that arent angels and having problems at school and at home i feel like just leaving the planet. At the same time i control my self and stay on track. I think this book is good because it made me see that Joe and his family are in a tuffer situation and i shouln't complain instead i should realize and help out."
4,"""Teacup Full Of Roses""","The book "" Teacup Full Of Roses"" by Sharon Bell Mathis is about a family who has problems, and how these problems sometimes tear families apart.One of the charecters in the book is Paul. Paul is a great artist. The only thing wrong with him is that he's addicted to heroin, and he barely got out of rehab. Paul is also a thief. He has even stolen T.V's, and money from his own famoly. Even out of rehab he still uses heroin.I think that the story is good, because I think people should know some problems families have, and if a family doesnt have problems they should be grateful. I would recommend this book for teens and up, because it's a really great book."
5,this guide is even better than the textbook itself,"before i read over the book 3 times just to drill all the main concepts in for an exam, but then i discovered this study guide and believe me it is alot better than reading the book 3 times."
3,Good guitar,Guitar had nice action but lacked that big box sound but for the money and size it fit the bill.
3,Less that I expected,"18 pages to color, that's all and that makes this a rather thin Bellerophon coloring book. The images are all simple line drawings making the coloring fairly easy. Each one is taken from a surviving source that shows the queen or her family in their roles as liasons between Egypt and Aten, the sun god. No credit is given for the text or illustrations..."
4,Satisfied with service,"I received my order with no delays, and the book was in good condition. I would buy from this seller again."
4,Great for a school reference material.,"This is the reference book that most institutions of higher education want you to possess. If you need help with your english skills this is the book for you. If you need help for anything from a sentence, to how to write a reseach paper then this is the on."
5,Big Help,"ALthought their is a new one out, this really helped me to understand how to cite any type of source and how to write a proper essay. Great little book."
2,cant handle the pressure,"i have been using it for about 6 months it wind knot easily , looses it color on your hand green stuff, it fray out and burst easily an i had to change my line"
5,Good product,Not a bad product. I really prefer the Power Pro though as it has a smoother body and casts much better. But overall this is not a bad braid.
4,Soon to be tried,Fishing line is a present to my oldest son. He should be trying with big fish in Mato Grosso State shortly.
1,bad shipping,"The product is great! The problem is the it takes 3-5 weeks to get the item when it lists as ""IN STOCK"""
4,Where it all started,"Carnage today would be somekind of superband. Featuring Michael Amott(later in Carcass, Arch Enemy and Spiritual Beggars), Matti Karki, David Blomqvist, Fred Estby(now in Dismember) and Johnny Djordevic(later in Entombed). ""Dark Recollections"" has something from each band.Imagine Entombed, Dismember and Carcass together, but with a crappy sound. The album was recorded at the beginning of the 90's, where everything was starting and then would become one of the greatest death metal scenes. So, the production (or lack of) it's understandable. Besides that, is a good album. 100% raw death metal (growls, fast guitars and drums, and grotesque lyrics and environment) and all these guys playing together. What else can you ask for?Anyway, an album with a great symbolical value. Where it all began. Listen to the Swedish pioneers!"
4,Classic,"This album is along the same lines as old MASSACRE, or old CANNIBAL CORPSE when they used to be good. Just good solid death metal. The riffs are simple, but technical at the same time. If you are looking for some good ""Old School"" death metal this is a must have."
3,A piece of my heart,Interesting book but it gets a little repetitious. I purchased because I know one of the women in the book. It is amazing but these people really didn't know what they were getting into
4,a piece of my heart,"Excellent and informative, also sad. Interesting to read the other side of the Vietnam War, the casualties, still living and remembering."
5,"Good Times, Bad Times",These stories are so heart-wrenching I had to take a break while reading simply to keep from falling to pieces. These women are so amazing and strong - they're inspiring. I Loved this book and GREATLY recommend the play with the same title by Shirely Lauro that was based off of these stories. It's so unbelievable and so real it makes you feel for those 6 women more than you'd ever imagine!
4,Helpful and comforting,"This is the first book I bought on homeopathic medicine when I first began using it more than twelve years ago. I like the way it is written - it almost feels as though you have a kindly physician sitting across from you. That being said, my one complaint with this book is the repetories/remedies pages that are placed at the end of each chapter. I have never used these and find them a bit confusing.If you do buy this book (and I encourage you to - it's well worth the investment) I would really encourage you to read the book through. Then you will be able to more easily find the remedies that apply to you in times of emergency. I now have several books on homeopathy on my shelves, and this is always the first one I turn to when I or a family member are sick.Well worth the investment."
1,HOMEOPATHIC MEDICINE AT HOME,"THIS BOOK IS A BIG WASTE OF YOUR MONEY! A TOTAL WASTE OF YOUR MONEY! THEY DIDN'T HAVE A REMEDY FOR EVEN PLANTAR WARTS! HERE'S ONE FOR YOU! TRY PUTTING CASTOR OIL ON A COTTON SWAB, PUT IT ON THE WART, APPLY BANDAID, DO THIS FOR SIX WEEKS. THE WART WILL TURN BLACK AND FALL OUT. GET A CLUE AUTHORS! ONE STAR IS GEING TOO GENEROUS!"
4,Quite a good product for urinary health,This is a great product shown to be effective in bladder and urinary health. The only downfall is that you should only limit use to 1-2 week intervals and give the body a rest. The product can interfere with some medicines and is not good if you have tinnitus
5,Best kept secret from Arizona,"Roger Clyne & The Peacemakers' album entitled ""Honky Tonk Union"" is the best album of 1999. Give this album a try and you will be addicted to it. Singer/songwriter-Roger Clyne and drummer-P.H. Naffah carry their Refreshments experience over along with guitarist-Scotty Johnson of the Gin Blossoms, guitarist-Steve Larson of Dead Hot Workshop, and Danny White on bass put together a phenomenol album with songs about LIFE itself. Traditional, roots-rockin'music with some twang that goes the extra distance, so grab a beer and gives these guys a listen. If these guys don't get recognized into stardom then there is something wrong with today's society in music. Buy this album now!"
3,Climbing up the Ladder,"Roger Clyne and the Peacemakers have arrived. I will say I really enjoy most of the songs on this CD. They have a pretty good sound that has plenty of energy. I only give them 3 stars due to the fact that I know they have a lot more potential. I am eager to see what they will come out with next. Until then, go out and take a chance on this CD, or at least see them play live."
2,Good Night & Hello,"I have to say this CD has some potential. I bought this CD off of this site because I had heard of the Refreshments (who were awesome) and wanted a little more of the same. Although these guys aren't in the same ball park with the old Refreshments, they do have some potential to get their name beyond the shadow that the Refreshments have placed them in until this point. After all, most people who buy this CD bought it because they were true Refreshments fans. The Peacemakers with Roger Clyne do have the potential and although they may not have done it with this first CD, look for them to come out running with their next release..."
2,It's the same old song,"What started as the Refreshments, a good old southern rock-n-roll band, turned into Roger Clyne and his Peacemakers, an attempt at Roger putting himself above the members in the group in the way Tom Petty or Steve Earl have done in the past. Talented musicians play throughout the CD, but with all this talent one would think there would be some originality involved in the music creating process. It's the same old song, same old themes, almost as if Roger was hurtin' for songs to write about. I would like to see more out of a band with this much potential..."
4,Unique and Satisfying,"Remember the Refreshments? Oh. Well, remember the Gin Blossoms? These two great bands out of Arizona are no more, but some of the pieces have come together to form Roger Clyne & the Peacemakers. Clyne was the lead singer of the Refreshments and he leads here with the same cockeyed, rocking, street-smart cowboy world view that we (who have heard of him) have grown to love. The songs are all over the map, from the uplifting rockers that open the set, the misfit ballad ""Green and Dumb"", to the humorous barroom tale of ""Jack vs. Jose"". A couple of countrified tunes make their way in here and ""My Heart is a UFO"" is just awful, but the strange journey that is Honky Tonk Union is, in the end, a unique and satisfying one."
5,En Tequila Es Verdad,You owe it to yourself to buy this album and both Refreshments albums. You should also go see these guys.
4,Great stuff,"I was a huge fan of The Refreshments (Roger Clyne's first band) and could not wait to get this CD. I was not disappointed. Tunes like ""Beautiful Disaster"" and ""Tell yer Mama"" stick with you all day, and ""Jack vs. Jose"" is destined to become one of those songs everyone sings in bars. A little bit country, a little bit rock 'n roll, and a [heck]of a good buy."
2,Sad Day in Mudville,"After the Refreshments broke up, I couldn't wait to see where the key players would land. I bought Honky Tonk Union the moment it came out. What a let down. The Refreshments were fresh and distinct. The Peacemakers are uninspired and generic. It's obvious that Roger Clyne has talent, (Jack Vs. Jose, City Girls), it just seems that he has surrounded himself with a backup band of the Gin Blossums or Shania Twain. The unique sound that the Refreshments had is certainly not evident here. More Nashville than Tempe. There are 3 or 4 decent cuts but the bulk of the album is country lite. Bring back the Fizzy Fuzzy producer, Cliff Norrell."
3,Well its not the Refreshments,"This c.d was a little bit of a shock to me, I was very happy to see that Roger Clyne had a new band . . . . but its not the Refreshments. Its ok at best, with a few really good songs and a lot of band songs. Beautiful Disaster, Never Thought, and Green & Dumb being really good, but then there are songs like My Heart Is A U.F.O and Tell Yer Momma that make me feel I'm causing myself pain just for the heck of it. It was nice to here Roger Clyne again and if you are dying for some Refreshment like sound then pick it up. Just don't go over board with excitment waiting for it to show up in your mailbox. Roger Clyne did grow up a bit with a little less sillyness, but then again thats what I loved about him in the first place. Hope you like it . . .."
4,Party in a box,"If you want the starter kit to creating your own LA club in your house, this is all you need. Great mixes from the acid techno scene. Even if you're already a house/techno pro, use these mixes to sample your own sounds! A bit pricy, but worth it"
4,Mantid temp home,"I used this to raise my mantids prior to release in the garden. It worked just fine and the ventilation holes were small enough to keep the mantids in. Unfortunately they were large enough to let fruit flies and aphids out, a couple layers of cheesecloth took care of that. I will be using it again next year for my mantids."
4,work for small fish too,"We use these cages to keep individual zebrafish for a week or so. They are not particularly durable and tend to stick when stacked one into another for storage, but overall a very good value at <$3 each."
3,Flimsy,Wish the lid was more sturdy. I had to return and get another one due to the lid being cracked when I received it.
3,dimensions not quite right,"The dimensions of my medium Faunarium were not as advertised on this page. The advertised and actual dimensions are as follows:Lenght: 12 inchesActual lenght: 10 inches if measured at the base, 11 if measured at the topWidth: 7.5 inchesActual width: 6 inches at the base, about 6.75 inches at the topHeight: 8 inchesActual height: 6.5 inches without the lid, 7.5 inches with the lid.Other than that.... well, it's your standard plastic terrarium. Unfortunately, I bought this to replace a friend's which I had borrowed and damaged. I can't give them a smaller, lesser product than what I had originally borrowed, so I'll have to order a larger one. The lid of this also seems more brittle than my original, so I think my next purchase will be from a different maker."
3,"Is ok, certainly not high quality","The door has come off several times and in order to get the door to shut, my 5 year old bangs on it repeatidly with a fist. Also the bottom of ourswas cracked in about 1 day (perhaps someone stood on it) so no longer good for any water type critters. Haven't used it to house anything alive yet."
3,Its okay,"The one good thing I can say is,the smell seems to last awhile but it has a cheap quality to it. I wouldnt buy again."
4,Almost perfect: slipping & glare,"I really like my ray bans except for the fact that they slide down the bridge of my nose repeatedly; I guess that's my fault for not reading a guide to how to choose which size. Another aspect that's not ideal is the amount of glare that the tilt of sunglasses let in on both sides of the lenses, but then again it's partly my fault for not paying extra for a polarized pair.One thing I really like about these sunglasses is that they don't have those annoying pad arms and nose pads that get caught in my hair when I put them up. Also, when you stow them and collapse the temples, the temple tips don't scratch up the lens like cheaply designed sunglasses do.btw: I know that 2113 are a man's style but their lens are bigger than any of the styles for women which all looked too small for my face; so far someone has yet to notice and point it out!"
3,"Cute Toys, Seriously Overpriced","They're cute toys... but seriously overpriced. Just bought the fisher-price Pablo, Uniqua, and Tyrone at the local Walmart for $5.88 each. They didn't have Tasha or Austin in stock, so I thought I'd look online, and I'm shocked to see a set of 5 dolls going for over $100. It's crazy, and pretty low to overcharge so much for a child's toy."
1,This book was so bad it was painfull!,I didn't think it was possible to write a book in which every character is absolutely lifeless!
5,Amazing documentary,A pro Soviet documentary that features outstanding footage of the bloody Battle for Berlin. You'll see Soviet artillery pounding German positions. You'll witness Soviet infantry clearing buildings occupied by German defenders. Soviet armor as it rolls through the streets of Berlin. I was impressed by the quality of the classic footage. I recommend this video for anyone interested in World War two especially eastern front combat.
2,"""Dance out"" Sessions 6","Yesturday I borrowed this CD from my local library, before I went and bought it, and was utterly disappointed. I am a massive fan of chillout and electronica, but I could only find one or two songs that were actually chillout.The only thing stopping me rating this album 1 star is the fact that there were actually a few good songs, but besides that, it should have been called Dance-out Sessions 6. That's what Disc 2 is. And half the songs have the same intro anyway.Don't waste your money. If you want real chillout, buy Cafe del Mar."
5,Get it if you can find it,"I haven't given an album that I recently purchased a 5-star ranking for a long time, as it is reserved for the classics. It is one of the top ranked thrash albums on rateyourmusic, but it still doesn't seem to get widespread respect.As another reviewer said, the songs are unorthodox and this does not really conform to any one metal genre. The vocals are harsh, but definitely enhance the sound of this album.Haven't heard their other albums, but apparently I will need to check them out. Unfortunately, this album is becoming rare, so hopefully it will be re-issued at some point.Recommended!"
1,Major Disappointment,"What happened to the VB.Net to accompany the C#? MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT that all the VB.Net is gone!I don't care what you C# snobs think about VB.Net. Fact is, the junior programmers in our shop probably will never learn C/C++ or C# because VB.Net is definitely good enough. I find myself using it more and more, especially when I want to code something quickly with a minimum of hassle."
4,Pretty darn good,"A good book to use both as a learning guide, and as a reference. Though some of the code examples could have been tightened up a little bit, they do a nice job of starting at the very bottom/core of ASP and working their way up -- teaching you how to use ASP to create quality applications instead of glue and popsickle stick nightmares."
3,NO SOURCE CODE SUPPORT,"Good Content, 3rd Edition lacks Example Source Code on his website (Only 2nd Edition and new ASP.NET 3.5 is available).If you want to learn ASP.NET 2.0 using this book seriously you probably need to do lots of typing.Illustrations and pictures are not that straightforward, you need to imagine a lot before getting your hands dirty in VS 2005."
3,Great for beginner book,"Programming ASP.net does a wonderful job of explaining ASP.net's event driven model and the rest of the core feature sets to ASP.net. It also targets both new developers using VB.Net and also C#. While this a great book for new ASP developers, its definitely not a book for those developers who need the nitty gritty details for the ASP.net classes. The book also doesn't touch enough on extending ASP.NET w/ HTTP Modules and leaves out a lot of things that seasoned developer would find useful such as explanations on the distributed debugging features of Visual Studio.NET IDE, handling file uploads, handling email related task, etc.If you are a new ASP.NET developer, this is the book for you."
1,Absolute crappiest book I ever bought,"Talk about padding the pages! Hey O'Reilly - we don't need to re-print the whole dang piece of code to show a snippet. And have you guys ever heard of drag and drop on the page? Nah - couldn't do that either - let's just reprint the source code instead. It's more impressive that way - a thicker book *must* be better, we can price accordingly *and* it fills the ""library"".Utter nonsense."
5,Makes the Subject Very Approachable,"I've been using this book since its first edition as the text of an ASP.NET class I teach for the last two years, after looking over many others. It covers most of the areas on the subject very well. However, I do provide my own supplemental material on a few missing, but common and easy to handle, topics for building more complete web apps, such as HttpCookie and SmtpMail. Still highly recommended!"
2,Not the best resource for ASP.NET,This was the first book on ASP.NET I purchased. I'm usually pleased with O'reilly books but this one misses the mark.A better choice for beginners is Murach's ASP.NET by Anne Prince and Doug Lowe or if your interested in something thicker try Microsoft's Programming ASP.NET by Dino Esposito (an excellent resource).Also a good resource for datagrids is ASP.NET Data Web Controls by Scott Mitchell.
3,Look elsewhere - little content - poor examples,"Unlike Jesse Liberty's Programming C# book, this book does not measure up.It leaves one wondering if he has ever written a real Asp.Net application.This book is also very bloated . Everything is shown in VB and C# AND the whole program listing (even IDE generated stuff) is often shown multiple times (is he lazy or just trying to increase page count?)Most examples are very contrived and none of them teach real-world scalable techniques."
1,Disappointing...,"I find the book to be poorly organized. Further, it makes the worst error a book can make -- to assume the reader already knows the material for which he/she bought the book to learn in the first place. The book comes across as disjointed and does not flow. The example concerning the program developed throughout the course of the book, a bug reporting program, drags on and on and on...very tiresome. The database information I found next to useless and angeringly frustrating to follow, as result of the disjointedness to which I referred earlier, and a great lack of clarity. One concludes upon reading this book that the authors genuinely know their subject, but are frustratingly unable to clearly, concisely, and logically communicate that understanding in a flowing, useful, organized fashion. My advice? Save your money."
5,"No, you don't need Visual Studio.NET","That's categorically false! VS.NET is *not* necessary to work through this book. Jesse doesn't even start to get into Code-Behind until chapter 6, p199. This book admittedly has some code errors, but the author addresses these issues right away at his website... section. This is no doubt the best ASP.NET book on the market and I am thankful I trusted his fine reputation with other works (Like Programming C#). BUY THIS BOOK!"
2,ADO.NET part in this book is confusing.,I've read both this book and wrox's PROFESSIONAL VISUAL BASIC.NET. I found that wrox's book is much clearer than this book. This book just gives you some programming codes without clearly telling you why and no comparasion to each approches.I'd say I don't like this book. It's so dry and hard to read. I prefer wrox book.
5,For ASP.NET Beginners and intermediate programmers too!,"A previous review panned this book for being for beginners; but that is what is great about it. This book teaches you everything you need to know to write ASP.NET applications.That review complains that this book is weak on Delegates, Threading, Remoting, and Event handling but those topics are not ASP.NET; and Liberty covers them in detail in his Programming C# book (which is also excellent).Where this book does shine is in covering ASP.NET, and all the aspects of writing a powerful internet application with ASP.NET. Excellent coverage, not only of controls and web forms, but also of data display and binding, interacting with databases, deployment and so forth.This book is highly recommended."
3,A good introduction to ASP.NET,"I generally liked this book. There are some reviews on this site that dismiss it, but I have to disagree. This book would be a good intro for those new to ASP.NET, expecially to ASP 2.0. I do agree that experienced developers will probably want a bit more, and that they may event get tired of the extreme detail provided in some sections. However, ASP.NET is a complex system, and details are important. Besides, I've never found that a single book can provide all the information that I need.I'm an MCT, and I've been using and teaching ASP 2.0 since March 2005, so I expected to already know everything in this book. However, the book pointed out some things that I didn't know. That was a pleasant surprise.I believe that this book deserves a space in your reference library."
2,Heavy on the lingo!,"My school purchased a class set of this book for twelfth grade students. At first, the class seemed excited by the main character's similarities to themselves. However, after some time struggling with the heavy basketball lingo, their interest waned considerably. Eventually, the class having fallen apart about halfway through the book, we gave up. This might appeal to a very small group of young, male, underpriveledged students, but seems a hard sell to students from other circumstances."
5,This book is amazing!,"Slam is a amazing book. It is a book about a boy who has to overcome a lot of challenges in his life like his grandma is constantly in the hospital, he is almost failing out of school, his girlfriend and him have constant problems, and his best friend ice is a drug dealer. The one thing in the world that he loves to do is play basketball. He is the best player on his varsity team as a sopohmore and needs to get a scholarship because his mom can't pay for him to go to college. This book is a thriller about a boys life and it shows a good amount of ""hood"" words like ""the pill"" referring to the basketball and others. Overall this is an amazing peace of literature."
4,point and dunk,"A very realistic coming of age year in a young basketballer's life. One of the most compelling plot tangents was the teenage angst and confusion that the central character experiences at home, at school, over his career path and with his friends and social life. Myers has again written a wonderful read for the young, and for those who wonder what is inside a teen's head today."
2,"Ready to ""Slam"" this book shut!","This story takes place at Brooklyn during preasant time and the setting is important because it's one of the many obsticles Slam has to live with.This book is mostly about a 17-year old boy named Greg A.K.A. Slam has to go through a tough life and he enjoys playing basket ball. He has two outcomes, to be successful or fail like his best friend Ice.In my opinion the book was okay, but it needed just a little bit more basketball action . I would not recomend this book because it needs more action."
4,slam-dunk,"Slam is a book written by Walter Dean Myers. It a book about this boy named Slam which is a ball and street name what they call him. Slam is a young black boy who in high school playing ball. They say Slam is one of their best players on his high school team. Slam has a best friend named Ice who is the total opposite of Slam! But no matter what they are still going to be the best friends even with the hard times they went through. Why do I think it is important to me,. because it show that as u get older things change, and u start doing mature things. I read this book because some of the thing that I am going through right now even with my teammates or very close friends."
4,Slam!,"This is a good book about an urban kid trying to get a good career in basketball, but he has problems on the way. He is the star player at his high school but runs into some problems like his friends, drugs, girls, and school. He gets transferred to another school and is trying to fit in there while trying to keep up in his school work and his basketball career. I like this book because it shows how to take care or situations and keeps you wondering how he's going to fix his problems. I recommend this book to sports fans, teenagers, and some children."
3,Mostly Boring,"SlamThe main character was about a kid named Slam that lives in the ghetto and is switching to a more academically challenging school. His best friend Ice went to the old school. He hopes he could still be friends with Ice. He doesn't like most of his teachers at his new school and he doesn't like his basketball coach because how thinks Slam has an attitude problem. Slam is trying to make friends at his new school, survive in the ghetto, and stay off drugs. I sort of liked this book. On a scale of one to ten I would rate it a six. It wasn't very action packed and I like books that are. IN the beginning and the middle it wasn't very suspenseful. So you didn't want to keep reading it. At the end it was better because you wanted to see if him and his friends stayed off drugs and how they survived."
3,Basketball Is Life,"At least it is for Greg, or as his friends know him, Slam. Having transferred from Carver High, a basketball powerhouse, to Latimer, a school for smarter students, he goes from bench warmer to team star. Walter Dean Myers does an extraordinary job of giving Slam the street-wise inner city personality that one would not normally find in a ""smart"" school like Latimer. Tempers flare and emotions fly as Slam and his coach argue over his place on the team. The book reaches it's climax when Slam and his team play Carver and his best friend Ice in the district championships. Do Slam and his team beat the odds and beat number one Carver? READ THE BOOK AND FIND OUT!"
4,An Interesting Story,Well this story is about A teenager named slam and how he and his best friend live in New York and how he deals with his friend selling drugs and how he went through a situation where he cheated on his girlfriend. This book is interesting and relates with a lot of things that most teenagers go through.
5,SLAM! Walter Dean Myers,"This book starts with a boy name Greg Harris ""slam"". He knows that he is one of the best players in the school and thinks he is going making to the team. But his luck might run out. his grades aren't so great and his teachers are starting to notice. And his temper isn't so great either when he gets mad he is going to explode. Slam is playing around with his life and future. What do you think is going to happen next? Read this book and find out."
5,this is a great book to look at life on !!!!!!!,"This a very good book and I think that anyone that plays sports should read this book!!!!!! It shows you how important it is to keep up your grades,when you play sports!!!!! It is areally touching story!!!!!"
4,Great Book,Slam is a great book to buy. It teaches you about a lot of things useful in life. I liked this book beacause I like sports and it has a lot about basketball. If you read this book you will learn how to deal with things. There is one thing that could have been better was the ending. I expected more. The author is good at keeping you reading. This is a great book to read.
4,4 Starz,"this book was really great-i love walter dean myers books like the glory field,monster. i just wish it was longer"
2,Slam! reveiw,"It was ok,but it could have been beter. It was a little boring.I think kids would like it more. Or people that like basketball,they would enjoy it. They should have had some more exciting parts in the book."
3,Review of Slam,"I liked this book because it was about sports. Sports books are my favorite type of books to read because most of the time the stories actually can happen. I especially liked Slam because it showed the life of many kids growing up in a bad neighborhood. Slam was able to overcome the stereotypes and he pushed himself to be a great basketball player, even when things weren't going his way.I would recommend this book to people around the age of fourteen, because it does have some things in it that I doubt people much younger would understand, and people much older probably wouldn't care for. Slam is a good book for people to read if they like sports, because it shows the coach against player conflict, that many people have gone through. I enjoyed reading Slam, and I hope that anyone else who reads it will enjoy it too."
5,clean smooth jazz accordion,Art van Damme is truly a man of humility. Its no wonder he's been blessed throughout the years.
4,Platex Front Close Bra - white,"This is a very comfortable bra. The straps are comfortable and the front closure is comfortable. The only color for this one was WHITE. It has a great fit, but there needs to be more colors. It feels like you are wearing nothing, but to have it in more available colors would be awesome."
3,comfortable,Very comfortable but difficult to remove or put on with the overabundance of clasps and elastisity of the bra itself. This bra is thin material in the chest area so nipples will show.
1,Low quality and not too much support,It's very stiff and still does not provide as much support as I would have expected. Will stick to purchasing this type of stuff at store...
4,Almost perfecet,"I would say this bra is just about perfect. The only thing that would have been better is if it ran true to size. The cup size is just a bit big, just a bit, . . . it is the 38 size that is way off. I read the reviews and they all said it ran small. They were not kidding. I normally wear a 36B and so I ordered a 38B. It is still snug. I am going to have to hand wash it so it will not shrink or hopefully I will lose just enough weight to get it to fit there. Again, for the money, this is a great bra. I love the back support I feel with it."
4,Posture Bra,"This is a great bra that washes very well. Price to product value is excellent.I find that it tends to be tight around the rib cage & for that reason I needed to order one size up. The lace additions on the cups make it look a bit prettier but it definitely isn't in a sexy lingerie class.The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the hooks & eyes are SUPER SMALL.. If you have any small motor issues, look for a different product.As usual I was very happy with my service & found product exactly as described ."
3,Runs small,"This bra runs a little on the small side. Also, there is a seam running through the cup which I failed to notice before purchasing. However, the bra has cotton cups and is well made. I'm keeping it to see if it will work as my body adjusts to my recent breast reduction. This is not a good post-surgery bra - and it doesn't claim to be, but it appears to be a fairly sturdy, well made bra."
3,bra has no adjustable straps,I like to feel on this bra but find it hard to get in to because IT HAS NO ADJUSTABLE STRAPS. I need a bra that provides support and is a little cooler in the summer months and thought a cotton bra would be the answer. I have arthritis in my neck and shoulders so find it somewhat cumbersome and do not wear it. I bought 2 of them thinking that they would be wonderful based on the reviews which is a bummer.
1,Not what is advertised,"I don't know what I expected from a posture bra, but this one has no structure to it. It basically just feels like a wireless bra. I'm not sure how it's supposed to help with posture if it's all just material. I give it one star because Amazon sent it really fast! I'm sending it back to Amazon today. =("
1,Probably a good bra if it ran true to size,"If you're going to order this bra, be sure to order up a full band size, or 2. It runs very small in the band, but the cup size seems accurate."
3,It's OK,"I purchased this in hopes that it would solve the shoulder pain I experience. It did! Unfortunately, it created lower neck/upper back pain. A disappointment."
3,Somewhat please,"I always find it challenging to purchase a bra online, because different bras in the same size fit me differently. So I was not sure if this would work. Overall the quality of the bra was excellent. I think it runs a little small in the cup size. I also wish it had a little more back support. The design in the back makes me more conscientious of my posture. It does not hold my back firmly but it is helping me improve."
3,A little too snug but comfy material,I purchased this for my aunt who needs back support. She told me her usual size but the bra size was smaller than her usual bras and were too snug on her. She is going to have to find extensions for the hooks to make them comfortable. She said she does like the feel of the fabric.
2,"Good posture support, but","It is a good posture support bra, but it rolls up. making it uncomfortable. I returned this item"
4,Runs big,Based on the previous reviews I ordered a size up. I normally wear 36DD so I got 38DD and it was huge. It's well maid. I can see that it would last long time. It looked perfect for what I needed at the time but I had to return it do to the size.
3,Cool cotton but a bit tight for band size,"I was pleased to see a cotton version of this style bra. I ordered my usual size, and found it to be tight in the band, particularly after laundering. Order a size up."
2,Exquisite Form Bra,This bra did not fit properly so I returned it. I would not recommend it unless you order a size larger.
1,NOt as advertised!,The only all cotton oart of this bra is the cups. I ordered it because of an allergy to synthetics and I am very disappointed.
5,very comfortable,There is nothing I dislike about this bra. It is machine washable. It gives a nice smooth line. I buy these over & over. The price is right.
4,Holds GREAT,I received this bra as a gift after surgery and it was heaven sent. It holds the girls great I still wear it. It's nice bra its thick but not so thick you are sweaty. Washes up nicely and holds shape good.
2,Not true to size,"item is undersized. Consider buying one or two sizes larger (or more) This is not rocket science, a circumference can be measured, can't it?"
3,best after surgery,I got these after my breast lift surgery and they are nice and comfortable to use with shirts or tshirts
3,"Likable product,","I liked the material of this product, the fit of the back likable, the size though fit like I could have ordered one size bigger than I did at the same time I ordered several other products in the same style and same size."
3,well.....,"gives you major support...but certainly not a sexy thing at all. It's almost like the girls have been bad and they are now in jail....very tight, very uncomfortable by days end."
2,not seamless,"Based on the photo, the cups appeared to be seamless, but they are not. The seams ripple and result in a bumpy silhouette--bad for t-shirts."
3,bra,"I have bought 6 of these bras and I love them, but the last 2 I bought started ripping under right arm. I will continue to buy them because they are so comfortable. Is there a policy to get them replaced when this happens?"
3,smaller than sized,"Item isn't all cotton, nor mostly cotton with spandex, it's mostly or all cotton cups and the back and edging is all nylon, and personally I don't care for so much nylon in my bras- they itch me. The sizing seems off, as many reviewers stated but I took a chance and didn't order a size in in band or cups and should have, it's very snug which gets uncomfortable after awhile and certainly creates much cleavage. Also I really only like the color nude in bras but this bra didn't offer that option. I may consider ordering again, in a larger size."
3,Exquisite Form Cotton Posture Bra,I should have went with my instincts...straps aren't adjustable. It's difficult to hook. The back is nice back and nice cotton cups. Fits true to size.
1,Who the hell would ever want to own this?,"this is by far the lamest thrash band i've ever heard. this is complete c-league thrash/crust at it's atrocious worst. don't buy this waste of crap, it is not worth your time or your money. the singing is ridiculous. the dude just yells while the rest of the band plays the same heard-it-a-million-times thrash-beat. the attempts at songwriting are pretty funny though. beats watching ""the Honeymooners"""
3,So/So,"This book is okay. It's got a short list of recipes... But the photography is beautiful. The most useful recipe for me was the dessert drink... Outside of that I wasn't really inspired by the dishes they selected. But to each their own. It'd be worth adding to your collection, if you want every Korean cook book out there, I guess."
5,History as you like,Jones is both serious and humorous. He gives us a fresh look at historical periods that have staled by familiarity.
1,The worst ever! ! !,"I received this item over a week after the promised 2day shipping delivery date. I had wanted the DVD so I decided to go ahead and keep it, even though I had requested a return. You can imagine my horror when I opened the poorly packaged item to find the package broken and 2 2nd disc instead of a 1 and a 2. Needless to say, I will not be keeping this item, which really ticks me off because I wanted it.I don't know about the stars, I meant to give the worst review, however, in my ignorance, I may have the given the best. Hope not. Alice"
4,Totally worth the purchase,"Though he's best known for his Monty Python stuff don't be fooled into thinking this series is comedy. Terry Jones is an expert on this topic and presents some very compelling detail about roles in medieval society. The real gem of the series is that with each profession you watch another piece of the whole puzzle fits together to give you a broad picture. Finding real information about this time period that isn't about nobility or war is virtually impossible and Jones fills that gap admirably. Invaluable (and very entertaining) knowledge for anyone with a casual or professional interest in this sort of thing.If I were pressed to find a negative about this series, it feels like a few ends are left dangling- I'm left wanting to see more chapters about the daily life of professional soldiers or lesser nobles. Some chapters, such as the one about kings, is more concerned with interesting trivia over daily life. All in all, minor complaints."
4,Great Tasting Hot Sauce,This hot sauce has great flavor and just the right amount of kick to it. I need to get a bigger bottle next time!
2,It's not that Great,"I bought this CD in hopes that Bobby D would make a great mix like he did in his greatest hits CD. But I was greatly dissapointed because Bobby trailed off he usual progressive and trance mixing styles and starts mixing , how can I say this, bad. Any teenage mixer can do this on his home technics turntables. Do buy it!"
2,"All action, no talk","The story alludes to ""backhistory"" between characters, but we never really get to know what draws these two together. There is a lot of physical/sexual contact but very little emotional connection that is written about. They say ""I love him"" or ""I love her"" to themselves, but (yawn) ok, why? the other disappointing thing is ""The Big Problem"" seems to be each avoiding telling ""I love you."" I've gotten used to some quirky insecurity in each that they work together to overcome, or there's danger, or something...this novel just felt like there was a too-tight deadline and the characters suffered for it. Read used, or not at all."
2,On a wicked dawn,"I love this book. Romance, suspicion, action and of course a happy ending. Every page brings excitement to be revealed. Great book. Enjoy.Chubitu"
1,Agree with those who didn't finish reading this book,"The book has essentially no plot and the same kind of dialog and sex scenes that previous books contain. No originality at all. Enough with these men who know immediately that this is the woman for them and manipulate the woman to come to that realization by using sex and self control, when their instinct is to dominate. Booorrrring. I didn't finish it and that's rare for me. Perhaps some readers are not familiar with the entire series, thus found something enjoyable here.I have read books by Laurens from before the Devil's Bride, Cynster Book 1 and she had some talent. I must say that her male characters are almost all exactly the same. In a few cases they differ a bit but the general idea and technique is the same, over and over. She has been coasting, I'd say since Cyster Book 5 or 6."
3,not enough suspense,"I love Stephanie Laurens but I like when couples meet under mysterious circumstances like in the Bastion Club Novels. I miss that component of the story. I know something is coming, but not soon enough, I am bored with the book right now."
1,On a Wicked Dawn,"I used to love Stephanie Laurens books, but they have grown very boring to me and all seem to have the same plot and characteristics. I did not even finish this book - it was such a disappointment!"
1,Boring,"I have read and loved every book in the Cynster series, however, this one was just plain boring. I became bored early on in the story and put it down. Picked it back up later to try again and then gave up. I was so disappointed. Stephanie Laurens is such a wonderful author and her stories always keep me interested so much so that I just can't put them down. I advise skipping this one altogether. Sorry Stephanie."
1,Sent the wrong Book!,I ordered this novel and they sent me the wrong one because the sticker label was on the wrong book.Really?! They couldn't take a glance at the novel title and just compare it to the order. It was so obviously wrong.
2,Boring!,I haven't yet figured out why she felt the need to split up Amanda and Amelia's stories. They might have made a good book if put together. But this book was just plain boring. Way too much emphasis placed on the characters' relationship. I like a good bedroom scene as much as anyone but there were just way too many. The plot really fizzled at the end and I had trouble even finishing it. Not up to the past standard of Stephanie Lauren stories.
2,Worst Laurens Book EVER,"I love Stephanie Laurens, but I didn't think she could write a worse book than ""On a Wild Night"". I was WRONG - this is worse. Virtually unreadable, improbable, and the hero and heroine are both snobby twits. I just hope that if in future novels she chooses to revisit the Cynster family, that the twins are away on a trip around the world somewhere when she does!"
2,A Major Disappointment,"I have read and thoroughly enjoyed each of the Cynster series from Ms. Laurens, and this is the only one that I put down without finishing. The plot was too farfetched, the characters uninspiring and the storyline failed to engage or maintain my interest. Perhaps this novel was too rushed to the publisher without the author's more typical craftsmanship? A disappointment for me."
2,It's time to let the Cynster series go,"The Cynster series started strongly, and I look forward to each new book. But this book is the end of the line for me, and hopefully for the author as well.The novel just wasn't very interesting, and while the sex scenes are certainly sexy - they're also very repetitive. After the first couple I just skimmed them to see if they ever advanced the plot, which they didn't.I think that Stephanie Laurens has fallen into the trap of liking her own characters so much that she thinks her readers will want to keep reading to see what happens to them. She doesn't seem to put the same effort into actually making the books good, as though we'll be content to just know that now both the twins are happy. (She's not the only one who falls into this trap as witnessed by the latest Kleypas novel, Lady Sophia's Lover.)In short, I'd skip this book if you're a longtime fan, and buy some of her earlier novels if you aren't."
4,Not Her Best Cynster,"I am a big Stephanie Laurens fan but this was not one of her best books. It started off with a bang and I laughed so hard at the beginning, when Amelia proposed to a drunken Lucien Ashford. Then it got really slow and although the sensuality was there, it didn't quite pack the wallop that her other Cynster novels had.The last portion of the book, when she introduces the rest of the wonderful Cynster family in, is where it again gets interesting.I really rate this as a 3-1/2 but gave it a 4 because a 3 was not fair.I was only slightly disapointed, but still a fair read."
2,no plot,"I am a major Stephanie Laurens fan. I have enjoyed her books becuase there generally character development, and a plot in addition to romance elements. I have been happy with the strong heroines and heroes that are good men. I particularly enjoyed the earlier Cynster books. This one has no plot. It is just sex that becomes repetitive and boring. I am embarrased to say that I rushed out to buy this book."
1,Only if you want a good sleeping pill...,"Right after reading Amanda's story (On a Wild Night), I just could not wait to read about her twin. Amelia's story became the 3rd book I read from the Cynster series. This 3rd experience was the equivalence of a cold shower: trivial plot, unchallenging story, and dragging sex scenes that made me yawn almost to the point of disjointing my jaw. I understand this is sensual romance, but excess even in what is expected can be detrimental. If this was the 1st book of the series I had read, it would have stopped there. I am not a writer but I guess it must be quite a challenge to do quality work every time. Either that or the Cynster saga has reached its limit and the inspirating muse (or formula) needs to retire.Anyway, IMHO this one is not worth even a free rental at the local public library. Hmmph! But at least it put me to sleep for a couple of nights."
2,Slow read,"I am a huge fan of this series, but unfortuatley this book does not live up to the rest of the books. After reading Amanda's story, one wild night, I was really excited to read Amelia's story. One wild night I was able to read in one day, On a wicked dawn took me nearly a week of persiverence. The story is slow and the characters are not written as well as in Stephanie Laurens other books. I'll still look foward to her next book but I would suggest that you skip this one."
2,Boring...hard to stick with it.,"I rarely write reviews and usually really enjoy Lauren's work; however, I find it difficult to stay with this one. I am always thinking of the next book I want to read and skim more than I actually read. It's hard to explain it's just that the plot isn't there. It's too many thoughts on both Amelia and Luc's part. I guess I just really like sparks between the characters and there isn't any between them. Someone else wrote that it should be the end of the Cynsters...I agree! :-("
2,Not up to what I have come to expect :-(,"Oh I was soooo looking forward to the newest Cynster novel, but I could hardly finish the book. Sure it had the usual ""sex"" scenes, but what NOT at all a good reader. She has written better, much better!!!! I feel that this book was written in haste and the time was not taken to develop the plot adequately. I really disliked this book. Definitely the worst I've read from this author, hopefully they will get better again from here, if not, Ms. Laurens will lose at least one reader, ME!"
2,How can an author write so well without,"much of a plot? I enjoyed the male Cynster books, even though they were skimpy on plot as well. This had very little to entice the reader. Amelia proposed to Lucien. He accepted... The End-right? No, this was the beginning. The only thing left was the seduction, the seduction, the seduction...on both sides."
2,Just words to fill the pages.,"From the very beginning page I knew this book was going to drag. I love Stephanie Laurens' books. She is among one of my favorite historical romance writers. This book however greatly disappointed me. The love scenes, while steamy, left me a little bored. The two just never really seemed to fit. Amelia was too naive and Luc's knowledge of sex was rather trivial. The words were there, but I just wasn't convinced of the passion and excitement of their lovemaking. When I find myself skimming through the love scenes something is missing. I also found myself bored with the page fillers. This book dragged out so many boring incidents occurring in the characters lives I couldn't even finish the book. I just skipped to the end. Which by the way concluded so uneventfully boring it wouldn't have made a difference if I had read it first."
3,Not as good as the Secret lover,"Somehow, writing the same thing again and again,it becomes to feel outdated.Or the passion went out of her writing.I do not know if I'll buy her other books from now on,also I have all the others from her until now."
3,On a Wicked Dawn,I greatly enjoyed this book. I recently discovered the Cynster series and purchased all of the titles. They have made great reading.
2,save your money!,"Like many other readers, I have eagerly read every one of the Cynster series. But this one is a waste of time. One reviewer noted it took them a week of perseverance to get through it. I'm going on 3 weeks and am still not done! Amelia deserved a better story and better character developement, I'm still not sure what sets her apart, other than ""she's a Cynster female."" And Luc has no obvious character other than being spineless. All in all, a pretty boring story-less read. Guess that's what happens when a usually good writer starts ""cranking them out."""
1,Isn't what I expected,"After reading the other Cynster books, I anxiously awaited the publication of this. It just didn't live up to my expectations. Maybe as a short-story this would have been all right, but so much is fluff (just adding pages) that one gets the feeling that the author is just trying to write a novel. Okay, we know that they both love each other...we know that he's no longer in need of her dowry...just tell her already. I usually can read one of her books in a day or so (after all, I do work and have a family), but this book took over a week and I had to force myself to finish it.If you're looking for a fast-paced romance...look elsewhere."
1,Boring,"This one is about the other twin in the Cynster series. Her name begins with an A. Yes, I am being sarcastic. The plot and characters are boring. So is the sex. There is suppossed to be a plot, not just sex -anywhere, anytime, anyhow. About the only nice thing I can say about this book is it is not as bad as On A Wicked Night. That's because the lead characters are boring, not hateful."
1,Yawn Yawn Yawn!,"I can usually read one of Stephanie Lauren's books in less than two days. It has taken me 4 days just to get to page 160. Not only was this book boring, but I was sadly disappointed that Ms. Laurens would be satisfied to end her Bar Cynster family series with such an unromantic story. There was no spark or true affection displayed between Lucien and Amelia, and every intimate scene was premediated. No spontaneity. All you need to knew is that Luc and Amelia end up getting married, so no need to waste your time reading how it happened. NoDoze might come in handy if you insist on reading the entire book."
5,ZOMBEDY,Movie quality was excellent. It is hard to find quality zombie movies these days. Story was ok. Effects were decent for the budget. Sometimes...comedy is all you need.
4,deadheads,To combine horror and comedy is no easy task.This movie does it seamlessly.The effects are very good and you actually start feeling sorry for the zombies.If you enjoyed Shawn of the Dead this is a must see
4,Surprisingly good,Didn't really know what to expect when I rented this. A horror/zombie/comedy movie is hard to pull off. Deadheads did so on all three fronts was a great movie. Highly recommended if your looking for something a little different.
4,Fresh Mayhem and Fun-Having,"I was taken by surprise by this movie at the Austin Film Festival, which was a HUGE hit with the audiences there. Comedy is hard, and directors Brett and Drew Pierce make it look easy. It's a fast-paced zombie romance about a guy who just wants to hit the road to find his girlfriend, and can't understand why everyone's shooting at him! Throw in a mad scientist plot, limbs that keep dropping off at inopportune moments, sufficient gore and a vegetarian zombie, and you've got a really fun movie.While it's affectionate and faithful to the zombie genre, it introduces new questions into old folklore. For instance, what if someone's immune system is able to resist the virus, so a person only gets a ""light"" case? ""Deadheads"" makes you care about the characters, and leaves you rolling your eyes and grinning stupidly at the end. Watch for a very funny and physical Markus Taylor who gets laughs without any actual lines."
3,Zombie buddy film,"This is the story of Brent and Mike, two high funcioning zombies. They meet after death and set out on a journy to find a lost love.Highly entertaining movie, yes very corny aswell, the on screen chemistry between the two leads is great and charasmatic enough to hold your attention.If your a little tired of the same old zombie formular give this one a go, its a refreshing new twist on the zombie genre, don't take it too serious and you will enjoy this zombie buddy filmA must watch for all die hard zombie fans"
1,Not funny. Poorly written jokes.,"So juvenile, I love zombies and zombie comedies but this had terribly written jokes and poor acting. Not even close to Shaun of the Dead."
1,Worst movie ever?,I would rather be water-boarded while someone poured hot wax on my nut sack than watch this chunk of poop again.
1,Soooooo bad!,"Who wrote these reviews? This film was terrible. The acting was so over the top I thought I was watching a cartoon. I wasn't expecting much, but this was so cheesy. I can believe the ratings for this. Had to be the film makers and their friends writing these reviews. So terrible. Save yourself time and money and watch something else."
4,It's great!!,"I love this song and, the first time I heard the song, I didn't really listen to the lyrics. The song was just catchy, I loved the tune. Well, the other times, i did listen, and it was really touching."
4,It's great once you pay attention to it,When I first heard this song I dismissed it. For some reason it just didn't catch my attention. The radio kept playing it and after a while I focused on the song. It has great lyrics even if they're kinda hard to follow. I love the tune and it hasn't even been overplayed....yet.
1,"A silly, silly book","Ludicrous plot, hysterical (but not funny) characters, and amateurish writing. Save your money."
1,"This is a unsubstantial, odd and disappointing book.","Stage's book is cheesy. It is 46 pages long, written in a jerky, disconnected, unfocussed style. She spends ten and a half pages on anatomy, offering helpful pointers such as ""The forehead is the part of the face above the eyes [...] Carve the forehead to suit the subject being sculptured."" Stage goes over various types of stone (alabaster, soapstone, turquoise, etc.) and briefly discusses technique and tools. But the information (excluding digressions) is really minimal and there are no addresses of suppliers. _Rock sculpture: the joy of stone carving for beginners_ is very inexpensive, but I would recommend looking for a book less cheap and more useful."
1,book not worth paper,"this book does not tell what equipment to use, where to find stone, hwo to carve different types of stone, nor how to carve stone at all. it is a waste of good paper and will not help anyone who wants to actually carve stone"
4,I like,The product definitely works however I don't like the fact that once I start running it starts sliding out of place.
4,Helps keep knee in place,"This product helps keep my husband's knee in position to make walking easier especially on hard floors (such as in the supermarket). He does not use it as an all day problem solver, but for the trips that entail many steps."
2,"Dries out Skin, Don't recommend","This sponge initially starts out hard as a rock. You would have to soak this sponge for awhile before you can get it soft enough to rub on your child. I first tested this out on myself, and found that my hands felt really dry, like the oils had been removed from my hands. I'm not sure that I would recommend using this on children."
2,"reads easy, but solves easy too","It is the first book of the series that I've read. I admit that the set up of the story and descriptions of New York City atmosphere at the turn of the centuries are very charming and interesting. In particular for someone who likes historical twist on a mystery novel. The idea of the placing the plot among ""charity girls"", even though somewhat similar to Jack the Ripper story, was good too. The author put a lot of effort and was very convincing when describing the life and motifs of those less fortunate members of society. Unfortunately the mystery part of the story is rather shallow and I often was angry with Sarah Brandt, repeating after her own thoughts ""How she could have been so dense, she had no idea"" for not making connections that were just too obvious. It is too easy to figure out, so if you are looking for a book that will keep you guessing till the very end, this one is a disappointment."
3,Not as strong as the first in the series.,"I did not find this book as strong as the first book in the series. I had figured out the mystery right from the beginning, and the author's attempts at a second mystery were also easy to figure out. But I still like the characters, and will read more of them. I also liked this early look at Coney Island and New York City. The life of the New York shop girls and the night life in the dance halls was also interesting. Ms. Thompson knows how to set a realistic scene for her books, and her strong characters carry the plot along. It's also fun watching the relationship developing between Malloy and Sarah Brandt. I look forward to more books in the series."
4,"Great Series, interesting characters","The second book in the series, picks up right where the first left off. Interesting story with insightful thoughts on society in late 1800s New York. Frank and Sarah's story is certainly interesting and growing in depth. I find the side story (or is it the REAL story?) of their relationship very intriguing.While I must agree with a few reviewers who said that the mystery was easy to figure out as you near the end of the book, I have never completely figured each of these out. Did I figure out most of the murder? Yes, but there is always a little twist Mrs Thompson has for us that I didn't see coming. The depth of the story, the growth of the characters, and the continuing saga of Frank and Sarah keeps the reader coming back for more and certainly makes for great reading. I knocked this story off in only 2 sittings.Already have number 3 and cannot wait to get started!"
3,"Extremely readable, but in the end nothing special","This book left me ambivalent. On the one hand, it is a great read with likable characters and wonderful atmosphere. On the other, it is a mundane and predictable mystery.I guess whether or not you will like this book depends on why you read.If you're want complex puzzles, gritty realism and deep insights into human behavior, this is not the book for you.But if, like me, you read purely for the pleasure of being transported to another time and place, you might find this book an entertaining, but not especially memorable, diversion."
3,A Little Too Moralistic,"The 1900s setting is interesting, and Thompson obviously has a good time creating and describing her two protagonists, but the murderer's guilt is too easy to guess, and the whole story is too moralistic. The deaf boy aspect is especially heavy handed. It costs Thompson credibility; I can't buy the idea that the father couldn't figure out about the boy's disability without Sarah's help. I realize Sarah's discovery serves the story, but it's not realistic."
3,Skip to page 121,"Good walk through of what you might find in your parents home that is valuable. I won't just repeat what others have said about this book. I would have put the dictionary style entries in the first section of the book as an appendix. Just jump ahead to section two and the book is more interesting. I didn't appreciate the third section on buying and selling. The authors told war stories about antique dealers and auctioneers that, while entertaining, would scare off any novice collector. Sure, buyer beware, but how about conceding that the vast majority of antique store owners and auction companies are honest and fair?"
3,Not exactly what I wanted,"I thought there would be more illustrations, but it is a good book to give ideas on what to collect by description.It's my fault for not researching this item more thoroughly.The vendor had the book sent out in great condition and I received it in a very timely manner.I would order another item from this vendor."
4,thrash metal review,"dark angel decade of chaos a good title for this cd as it has to rate as one of the better thrash metal cds of the early 90s.the tempo of these songs is fast heavy and aggresive.Although dark angel may not be as well known as some of the other thrash metal bands of that era,anybody who overlooks this band is truly missing out on some great metal!"
4,Great movie,"I have to outright reject the previous reviewer's 1-star rating. This was a great adventure film, that had me wishing I was right alongside with them. There is awesome scenery, great action sequences, humor, and a 'just for the hell of it' attitude that is very refreshing. Now, as for the ecological message - yes it gets a little heavy-handed and in the way of the movie. The message of over-consumption, and the ability to live in harmony with the land is a powerful and important one, and I give props to the filmmakers for tackling it, but they perhaps over-did it (time-wise). If you enjoy adventure books or movies, you will enjoy this, and it is DEFINITELY worth seeing!"
2,"Watch the first 30 minutes, then fast forward","It must be nice to be able to take off half a year from your job at Patagonia and have a film crew document your eco-slacker vacation to Chile; where your boss is hanging around in a shack drinking tea for several months waiting for you and the crew to show up so you can get lost climbing a hill.The photography is beautiful and it was enjoyable enough, although not believable, for the first 30 minutes or so. then it became an infomercial about Patagonia clothing and an eco-rant against corporate culture that made their never-ending vacation possible."
5,180 degress south,excellent...outstanding...motivational...a must see for anyone who may have the slightest sense and/or desire for an adventure...screw luck and embrace karma
5,"Amazing, must own movie!","If you're into watching surfers hit the standard Indo/Hawai'i etc. spots, this is not for you. If you're into watching surf flicks about someone in the pro circus, this is not for you. If you travel for the sake or traveling, to find a new place (be it a surf spot, a new town, a mountain, hiking trail) this is for you. For all of you who have traveled and things went wrong on that trip but you still stuck it out and lived to the fullest without regrets and scored huge, this film is for you. This film is as much about traveling the road less traveled and enduring the hardships that come with it as it is a tale of personal development and inspiration. I can guarantee you I will watch this flick before planning and/or taking off on a surf trip, or any other adventure. This movie is thought provoking and awe-inspiring, but alas many will not be able to comprehend these messages, or do not want to. If you're willing, give it a go, you won't regret it."
5,180 South - Excellent,Great adventurous movie! Came in perfect condition! This was bought for my son and a group to view at college. They felt like it was well worth their time.
4,there is still time,Great images and tunes to bring home the message that it is not too late to preserve for future generations mother earths special places.
2,Grumpy Old Climbers,"A Beautiful promotional film for Patagonia clothing with a sweet soundtrack. Unfortunatly too many wardrobe changes for a documentary. It's hard to believe so much ice melted while the crew fixed the mast and Jeff surfed with the local girl sporting the new Gibson. And dissapointing the legends and pro climber were so lost and ill prepared. Why are Yvon, Jeff & Kris so grumpy? Have they considered lowering the retail cost so the clothing is more affordable to surfers, climbers, snowboarders, etc, or perhaps increasing factory worker wages, instead of removing fences on their remote and distant land. Perhaps a real documentary, a story about meaningful corporate contributions would make for an inspired sequel of hope. One the three amigos could could sincerely feel good about creating."
3,Meh,"This documentary had a lot of potential, but it just threw it out the window as the movie went along. Some of what they did seemed natural, and some of it seemed forced...i would say the latter is due to pushing the desired messages of the Patagonia brand."
2,As unforgettable as the million other travelogue flicks...,"Platitudes about nature loom large and trite. Surfer-dude, nature-boy, free-spirit types with a camera crew take a vacation and yammer about crass commercialization and hatred of the consuming middle class. These outdoor types are just as boring as their bourgeois businessmen counterparts. Any IMAX travelogue is a better bet than this sermonizing vanity project."
5,Wow !!,"Beautiful, intellectual, and FUN !! One of my fav films of all time.An adventure that feeds the soul, and makes you feel like you're right there with them.Everyone in this film has lived a dream - they did IT.A wonderful documentation of exploring 180 degree turns to remote places on this planet and inside ourselves.And then what? You'll see !(be sure to see the extras too - as good as the film)"
4,Quirky but thoughtful and well done,"I think highly of the 180 South documentary and realized while watching it that the sound track was part of the pleasure. It was a different type of music than I had heard before: fairly laid back but interesting, seemingly casual but very professional. I simply liked it. When I went to check out Brushfire Records, the publishers of the sound track, I discovered a host of artists that look like they are going to be a pleasure to hear. So a new world is opened to me; I think it will be fun."
5,Impressed!,We thought the story and photography was great....we would enjoy viewing this over and over again. We'd recommend adding this to your library.
3,"OK, but arrived damaged","Item was OK, but poorly packaged, resulting in most of the fitting brackets being broken and therefore requiring repairs/modifications before it could be installed."
3,"Very good, should be called something else.","Likes: it's all one piece, so the handle is not able to come loose, and the whole thing can go into the dhswasher.Silicone is more heat resistant than other plastics. I've melted several nylon spatulas by leaving them in the pan on heat.Dislikes: like apparently all similar products, it's quite thick. It's excellent for stirring and scraping, but when I think of spatulas, I think of ones with a flat, thin blade, at an angle to a handle, useful for e.g., flipping over a fried egg or pancake. This product is mediocre at doing that.So ... I use this a lot, like it for what it doesm, but I still need nylon spatulas that I thought I'd be replacing."
5,Absolutely love,I bought three and love them and use them all the time. Best I've used for the money. Want more.
5,best spoon spatula,"Got mine a week ago, this is the best spatula I've owned and I own a dozen, no two piece construction, silicon and just the right spoon shape. Buying two more."
4,303 heaven!!,"An excellent album bringing together the best of Hardfloors work.The first CD is a collection of Hardfloor's own choonz, with the second CD having some Hardfloor remixes including their remix of New Order's ""Blue Monday"" and the Bassheads ""Is there anybody out there"", and also some remixes of Hardfloor records by Dave Angel and others.Uplifting and energetic, but never cheesy!"
5,This is a dancehall MUST HAVE.,"This CD should definitely be in your collection if you are a DIE HARD dancehall fan. Lady Saw at her best. As the title says,this CD is raw, but you should expect nothing less from Lady Saw. She has a unique way of expressing her experiences of love and sex."
5,I Luv it...Luv It...Luv It!!,"I'm sitting here listening to track 8:Give Me A Reason. And I am taken away! I have not found any reason to skip a track, yet. Sycamore Tree (#3) is also on my new fav-list. I am 46, listens to Reggae on a regular for 28 years, and I am pleased to have a disk that I don't have to skip between tracks because its too much. This one is just right. I'm gonna say it is one of those ""chick-disk"" items for the ladies when an extra kick and boom-boom is needed. Great for the work-out, too!"
2,Not As Good As The First,"While I enjoyed the first book in the Maggie Reid series, I found this one lacking. The storyline was too centered around all the men after Maggie rather than the reason her ex-husband Vernell was missing. It was amazing that every time she had a crisis, there was at least one or more incredibly handsome men around to comfort her.It would have been more interesting to expand the plot of the ""Redneck Mafia"", given us more background on them to help build the story around Vernell's disappearance.I found Maggie a little too self-centered in this book."
2,A great disappointment,"As an avowed Anne Perry fan, I was thoroughly bored with this book. First, the theme of the book is repetitive. Perry repeats herself in describing the characters' backgrounds in bok after book. In this one, the descriptions wore thin so Perry fans might find this tedious. Second, the beginning of the book begins with an error in editing or in sloppy writing. A question asked of a character and answered gets repeated by another as if he had not been in the previous scene. Very sloppy. Third, the author's anti-catholic stab adds little to the main story and seems gratuitous. Blaming the catholic Church for everything seems to be in vogue among certain circles nowadays but here it had nothing to contribute to the story line. Skip this book. Get an earlier MONK novel from Perry and enjoy it instead."
3,Great Expectations,"I have read all of Perry's books, specifically the Monk and Pitt mysteries... I kept thinking some twist in the plot was coming. After a certain mid-way point in the book any mystery buff, especially Anne Perry fans, could have fingered the murderer. Even after this I kept expecting a motive filled with shocking detail about human life. This was not the case. Overall I enjoyed reading the book, but I am looking for a strong comeback in the book about to be released."
3,Murder with Victorian Restraint,"This low-key murder mystery is set in the London of 1861. The major characters all are well-born, though not necessarily solvent. A high-spirited woman who fought in the failed 1848 revolution in Vienna is found dead in an artist's flat in London, along with the body of a woman of much less repute. Investigator William Monk and his wife Hester pursue the case, believing that the police have arrested the wrong man. Much of the motivation is driven by reactions to improper behavior, such as (horrors!) compulsive gambling. Characters struggle against Victorian restraints on personal behavior. London is dense with choking fog. All this would be interesting if the author had dropped a clue or two that would allow the reader to deduce the identity of the murderer. Unfortunately, we get an Agatha Christie ending."
3,A good try,"The writing and atmosphere are good in this one, but the plot stinks. We are constantly told what characters are like and how they feel, but we see little direct evidence to prove it. Too many plot threads, one involving Hester's brother and sister in law is created seemingly just for convenience in trying up part of the evidence in the main case. One good point- Runcorn is presented as a slightly more complex character. Monk sees him in a different light as they work together, and it seems as if some of their differences may be mending. It would be good for him to have an ally on the police force again. It seems that Monk is going to try and re establish some contact with his remaining relatives, and that would be good as well. It's about time that Anne Perry started to tie up the threads of Monk's life and bring the series to a close before it becomes unreadable. How many more dreadful dark family secrets can she work into her plots before she runs out of ideas?"
2,Thumbs down,"This is my first Anne Perry book, and it very well may be my last. I give this book two stars (instead of one) because of some mildly interesting characters and some nice period images of London. Otherwise, as a mystery, this book is the opposite of a ""page-turner,"" plodding along with relatively few plot developments and virtually no suspense. I had hoped that the ending would make the voyage worthwhile, but alas, the conclusion is an embarrassment. Thumbs down."
4,Not as good as some of her previous William Monks,"Enjoyed the story and the glimpses of history it includes, but felt it was not quite as good as some of the others; I am working my way through the whole series. I did guess 'who done it' quite quickly."
2,A Formula Mystery,"This is my first Perry book and I am disappointed. First, the plot is your typical mystery formula with false runs and blind ends, and a bit of a 'surprise' ending (but not really.)Second, the characters are all 'canned,' from the heroic freedom-fighter Elissa to the compassionate nurse, Hester, to the dedicated and logical surgeon, Beck, and on and on.Third, Perry uses the annoying technique of telling you what to think of her characters, instead of building their reputations on their actions and letting you decide for yourself what to think.I gave it Two Stars instead of One Star because there were some interesting period scenes of old England and some historical insights.Overall, it was boring."
3,Certainly Not My Favourite Monk,"I am a huge William Monk and Hester fan. I've always liked that series better than the Thomas and Charlotte Pitt series because the storylines are a bit darker and the characters more complex, but I didn't enjoy this book as much as the others in the series. I found that it had trouble maintaining my interest. I found it long and drawn out, with a very simple plot and storyline. I did enjoy seeing a more human side to Monk. He is my favourite character after all, and previous books have really not concentrated on him much. I found when we got to the denouement that the murderer and the way the crime occurred was a bit of a stretch--how did we get to that murderer and that scenario? Unbelievable and far-fetched. I will still continue with the series because I want to see what happens with Monk and his getting to know more of his past, but I hope the next installment is more exciting."
4,A Good Read,"Let's start with the flaws. The book includes lots of repetition (someone could start a drinking game for every time Monk says 'I don't know.') A good editor could have eliminated some of this and made the book less maddening to get through. The ending is a bit contrived and unbelievable. However, I have to admit that I was very taken with this book and totally believed in the characters, setting, and most of the plot. The characters were complex and interesting. Perry made them real. She also has done excellent research on the Victorian period in England. The details are fascinating and help paint a picture. Although the ending is not the most satisfying I've ever read, the reader is compelled to stick to the very end and care about what happens to the characters. All in all, a very enjoyable read"
2,"Talk, talk and more talk","I will not bore anyone with a rehash of the storyline.My opinion is that, once again, Ms. Perry has spent too much time on each character's thoughts and not enough time on constructing an interesting mystery.How many times and for how many pages do we have to repeatedly read of the courage, fortitude and nobility of those who were involved in the 1848 uprisings? Page after page after page...I've read many of the author's books and this seems to be a tradition with her. Many readers seem to enjoy it, but I'd rather have less lecturing and moralizing and more thought to a decent mystery. The last few pages seemed thrown together. After spending time on this book the reader deserved a better thought-out conclusion."
3,A good TKD basic for beginners.,I did not like this book when I got it. I found it simplistic. I kept it in my TKD library and eventually my wife found it. She had just started in TKD and found this book to be important to her understanding. A good beginner book. Mr. Yates has a good book on TKD forms. The one problem with this book is that the same book is found under the title of Korean Karate. Do not be fooled as it is the same book.
2,Only possibly useful for a total beginner,"I am a white belt and still thought this book was essentially useless. I should have gotten one of the slightly more expensive, in-depth books I believe."
5,Expendable By Phillip Keller,This is a wonderful pocket book. The was very imfomitive and helpful in adding in my understandng of this subject. I found the subject matter and text easy to read. The size of te book was easy to hold. A rare find for this book online. As I spent months looking for it before fiding it on Amazon. I should of just came here first.
5,Good Start in Medieval,"This a great album for those who wants to get started in the music of early Medieval Period. It's good to know and to have a simple reference, specially for those who are studying the History of Music. It's worth buying."
4,20th c classical at its best,"I'm especially fond of the pieces for solo electric cello (Suddenly it's evening) and solo bass (Three Pieces).The string quartet which opens the disc is probably the weakest spot of the piece, although the occasional vocal interjection does add some moments of surprise."
5,Clara Rockmore and the Theramin,"Imagine a virtuoso soprano with an unlimited upper range. Imagine a violin with the lower range of a cello. Imagine an instrument that allows for every nuance, for every slight embellishment, for every dynamic flourishment imaginiable.This album consists of plain piano and plain theramin - no other orchestration.The Theramin, as proved by Clara Rockmore, is capable of soaring song, of delicate melody, of pure expression.Rockmore's performance is a pure joy and a testament to the versatility of the instrument. When she takes off in the higher registers, the only thing missing is diction. But she more than amply supplies it with her exploration of all the registers this instrument is capable of - she is also capable of exploring the theramin as a contralto.This is an extraordinary album and well worth the price paid. Were it not for synthesizers and whatnot, the theramin would be envied as an instrument for virtuoso musicians."
5,A wonderful CD!,"The Theremin has, for too long, been associated with cheezy sci-fi movie Martians and the Beach Boys' stoned efforts on ""Good Vibrations"". In contrast, Clara Rockmore's performances (featuring synthesizer pioneer Bob Moog on piano!) are absolutely stunning. You must hear this to believe it. I can't say anything else... just listen!"
4,Wonderful...,"Gail Bowen is wonderful at evoking emotion. Even knowing the general plotline, each murder still had me feeling shocked and empathetic towards various characters. The plot is tight and moves along at a good pace. As in all of the other novels in this series, the characters are likeable and very 'human'."
4,Comfortable and cute boot,A very comfortable and cheek boot. Looks very well with leggings and jeans. The boot reaches all the way to your knees and it has an elastic band at the top. Ive gotten a lot of compliments on this boot it was worth the buy!
5,Calico kitty,"This kitty cat is soft and squeezeable. I got it for my little 1 year old niece. She loves my real calico kitty and I wanted her to have a kitty of her own. When she is older we will get her the real thing. When she saw the stuffed kitty she said ""OHHHHHHHH"" and gave it a kiss and a hug. The price was reasonable and the shipping was super fast."
4,Perfect stuffed kitty!!!,Needed a washable stuffed kitten for my mother-in-law. This animal is so soft and cuddly with beautiful blue eyes and is completely washable. Tucks under an arm or sits in a lap.
5,Adorable!,"Purchased this for my granddaughter, who loves kitties. She was very happy when she opened the gift, and continues to play with the toy every day. She cuddles it and carries it around everywhere. Its very soft, well made and worth the price."
1,Very very dissapointed...NOT REALISTIC AT ALL!!!,"I was soo disappointed when it arrived. This plush toy looks so different from what is shown in the picture. Nor realistic at all! And the fur as ordinary as all plush toys! We bought it for my daughter's friend birthday and it is SO SHAME to give it as the toy doesn't look cute and nice at all!!! The toy worth 3-4 dollars,no more!"
4,appealing plush,"this plush cat has a fun, flopsy personality and is very appealing. I only wish the paws had more detail."
5,perfect stuffed animal for kid,My son is 1.5 years old and got this for x-mas. It is very real looking and soft. He loves it. Perfect size stuffed animal to carry around and for car rides.
5,Daughter loves it!,"Bought this for our 16 month old and she loves it! It is very real looking, cuddly and soft. The details are impressive and she can easily drag it around with her."
5,The Laws of Attraction at Work,"A great book that offers a way to enhance your self esteem and confidence while increasing your attractiveness by uncovering and following your own dreams.It also helps to boost your persuasion power with verbal and non-verbal communication. It's sort of like taking a course in ""How to Build Your Own Attractor Factor,"" a quality that everyone desires but few possess.Yes, you can find that perfect relationship and that great job or starting your own business is not beyond your grasp.It's all about communicating between the inner you and the forces that connect you to the universe.Thank you Peta for this very powerful and well written book."
4,Great for your Beagle to Show!,"This book started off to be very helpful, but then we don't plan on showing our beagle, so a lot of the chapters weren't geared for our purposes. But again, this is just our opinion. Good reading."
4,Recently Adopted a Beagle,I ordered this book the day I brought our newly adopted 13 in Beagle home. He's 4 years old and my first Beagle. This book is extremely helpful to anyone who has been fortunate enough to have a Beagle to love!
3,Good album but...,"I have a problem with how this product is advertised. Neither Junior nor Buddy play in any of the extra tracks, and they are not that good either. Buddy only sings the first 3 songs, the rest are Junior's. Buddy plays a killer version of Hideaway, and Junior's sings 'mojo working' almost as good as Muddy Waters. The extra tracks really spoil the fun."
1,ROCK CANDY? MORE LIKE ROCK BOTTOM!,"Zzzzzzzzzzz...hmmmph...what? Oh, sorry, I must have fallen asleep listening to this dreadful album. What looks like a possibly fun listening adventure, based on the cover, is actually nothing more than a crashing bore of a compilation consisting entirely of cover versions of sugary sweet pop songs. What's really sad is that, although some of the songs are fun (in their original classic versions, anyway), this group has managed to suck all the life out of them. There's no bounce, no fun, no ""oomph!"". Nothing. Save your money. Avoid this one."
3,Oldies,"If you like the sound of old school pop this CD is for you. From ""Build me up Buttercup"" to ""I think I love you"" this CD brings back good memories of the soda shop on the corner and good old fashioned fun. When you are in the mood to just have some good clean up beat music, here it is! Enjoy!"
4,This is 1up for Ed!,"We liked the book a lot. It almost already seems like a classic. So much more information is being produced in Cultivation books, websites, DVD's etc.The Seed was definately First..."
2,Really more of an avertising brochure,"I kind of agree with the last reviewer about it just being similar to a Seed Company Catalog. The sponsors featured at the back even make me think that these companies paid to be included and I wonder if that affected the choice of varieties that were included. Once again I feel that Ed has missed his chance to really add anything new to the field and I wish he would get back to the nuts and bolts of growing instead of books with pretty pictures. However, the book is not outrageously expensive and if you just want to look at pictures of buds you might as well get this book. But if you want to grow get a different book."
4,Devotion. Imagination.,"Anne Catherine Emmerich has been beatified by Pope John Paul II. This is one more step on the road to being declared a saint in the Catholic Church.The book isn't necessarily an accurate transcription of her visions. Her visions are not necessarily a form of communication from God, nor do they necessarily originate in her own imagination exclusively.I think the book works wonderfully as a speculative and dramatic account as filtered through the experience of a 19th century German mystic nun. What annoys some other reviewers - the quirks in the style and the anachronisms - I think they are reminders that this isn't well-researched historical fiction nor it is a work of the inspiration of the Holy Spirit - it's in its own category.4 rather than 5 stars because I believe that one should read the Bible and non-fiction accounts about life in the Holy Land first so they get a good background before picking up the Dolorous Passion."
2,It was...interesting,"Not to say I don't like this book, but it had many major flaws. Now, I realize that it is supposedly a compilation of visions received by the German nun Anne Catherine Emmerich. However, there were some major historical flaws in it that ruined it for me. I was almost ready to believe it. I mean, it is so detailed and the way Emmerich described the people in it is so lifelike. However, the historical inaccuracies and frequent signs of anti-Semitism forced me to realize that (in my opinion) it is nothing more than a novel."
5,"Heart-rending, thought-provoking, deeply moving","This book has taught me to love others and be patient in suffering. It is a deeply moving account of our Lord's passion, death, and resurrection. Life changing for true believers!This is an incredible book about the dolorous passion of our Lord Jesus Christ. The book is a non-stop page turner. I lose all track of time as I am transported back to the way of the cross."
5,An amazing work for meditation,"I found this book riveting. It is essential for anyone wishing to medidate on the Passion because it provides the ""in between"" details not found in the Gospels. This shouldn't scare anyone away. There is nothing in here that conflicts with doctrine. I have found it to be both humbling and a tool for spiritual reflection that prompts repentence and the desire for reconcilation. It is easy to see how this work inspired Mel Gibson to make his movie. Unlike a previous review, there is nothing in it that is anti-Semitic, Jews are shown to help Jesus, be appalled at his treatment, etc. . . I'm not sure what they mean by anti-Semitism. As for historical innacuracies, it would be helpful to point those out. Highly recommended."
1,Apocalyptic nonsense,"This is the sort of loony stuff that apocalyptic Marianists read, and no one else can believe that any sensible person would read under any circumstances. The Catholic tent is a big one, but this stuff is outside the stakes."
1,"Well, if you are a bible thumper","They say Christ died for our sins and if we concentrate on his suffering, we are `saved'. I read this book for exactly the opposite reason. For me, this is a book about a man Holy or not who was tortured for his beliefs and that is a far more powerful premise. Everyone is convinced their beliefs are the only right ones there are, and everyday, as we can see in Iraq, people are being executed and killed in the name of religion. People die defending their beliefs, right or wrong, people die to preserve our freedom. Perhaps concentrating on the suffering we cause and undergo in the name of our personal beliefs is a far greater exercise, for it teaches us to be accepting of others."
5,101 ways to raise a happy baby,"Excellent tips and pearls of wisdom on how to raise a happy baby. It works! I have a happy baby as a result. Refreshing alternative in this selfish era of ""putting yur baby on a schedule to fit your lifestyle."" You can not give a child too much love. The information given is what women have known for centuries - nuture your babies. It is instict to nuture but women go against their insticts and follow the trends. Nuture your babies and they will be happy. I am sending this book to everyone I know with a baby. Also read books by Dr. Sears on attachment parenting. This book gave me the reassurance I needed to follow my heart and do what I knew was best for my baby. Advise is backed up with research studies."
3,Too Shallow,"Sent them back. Nice quality but way too shallow - only about 5 3/8"" tall. If you use a mixer, good luck. A much better mixing bowl is the Cuisipro Deluxe Batter bowl. Non skid tilt base, really deep, nice and large (3.5 quarts), nice pour spout, microwave and dishwasher safe, 25 year warranty. On sale at [...] and there are 10% off codes available if you search on [...]."
4,Great tool if you have someone to massage you,"Fantastic tool, but you need to have someone who is willing to use it on you. My chiropractor used it on me and it was fantastic as a trigger point tool. But, honestly mine sits in the drawer at home."
3,lambie pie2,"The book is poorly written but short and a quick read.We are attending a seminar on ""The Cambridge Spies"" so it is of interest to us.If you are interested in the topic this adds a bit of human interest.Although in today's world of women standing by their man--it may be more relevant than I first thought."
5,Finalmente!,"Robert Weede was one of the twentienth century's most underrated singers. At last, we have a representative Compact Disc of his brief discography. It is, quite simply, magnificent."
4,The Urge Change Their Sound,"This album represents a big change from Recieving The Gift Of Flavor and Master Of Styles. Overall, Too Much Stereo, is much slower and more pop oriented. The loud guitars from the last two albums are toned down quite a bit. The horns are only backround music. On previous albums heavier guitars and horns led the Urge. This is a good CD though even with all the changes. The best tracks are ""Too Much Stereo"",""Four Letters And Two Words"",""I Go Home"",""Living On The Surface"" and ""Warning Warning"". If you are a big fan of RTGOF or MOS then listen to this before you buy it. If you want to hear the Urge do something new definitely check this out. I still miss the loud guitars and prominent horn parts. Hopefully they will be back on the next album. This will still be in my CD player all summer. The Urge are one of the best bands out there and Immortal Records NEEDS TO RE-RELEASE ALL of the out of print CDS."
3,"Some Good Tracks, Some better than others","Not a bad cd. ""What is This"" and the title track ""Too Much Stereo"" are poppy and upbeat, while ""Say a Prayer"" brings in the softer acoustic side of the Urge with an odd beat which just makes the song strange and fun. This eclectic band even uses a baritone guitar on ""What do they know."" By far the best song on the cd is ""Push on Like Flintstone"" which has an amazing hard rock guitar riff on the end of it. Overall not a bad cd, but with lackluster tracks like ""liar liar"" show the band still has ways to go before they change their style completely from their old harder ways."
2,just not the same...and not very good,"IF YOU WERE A BIG FAN OF THE OLD URGE STUFF, DON'T BUY THIS CD! i am a big fan of bands like deftones, tool, incubus, 311, etc. the urge have almost completely lost their hard edge. Not only is the music a big dissappointment, but the album is plagued by silly, poorly thought out and just shallow lyrics. the horns are almost completely gone, and that also hurts the album. Unless you feel that sugar ray made a good decision going pop, don't bother with this one. check out master of styles or gift of flavor instead."
4,"Simple, fun mixer for ipod","This is a fun, simple to use mixer. The mic is adequate, watch out for speaker location to avoid annoying feedback."
5,Great Fit,"As a conservative mom, I thought the 'Conservative Lap Suit' might be in order. It fits well and stays in place. Well worth price."
2,disappointed,"The item was just as discribed, the iron is very strong and durable but weighs a ton. However, the shades are another story....!!!does not look anything like the picture online..!! it is very brown, it looks like it has a lot of dirt and dust on it, it is not white or even egg shell color like i thought it would be. The packaging for delivery was great...!!The return process was a breeze. I will difinitely buy from this manufacturer again!!"
2,An Anti War Rant,Not what I expected. I served several tours in Vietnam in combat yet I observed very little of the emotions the author attributed to soldiers serving there. Most didn't want to be there but they did their duty honorably.
2,review of Vessel,"The lyrics and the voice of Vessel are absolutely wonderful. However, The album is a bit hindered musically. The reggae cuts are not produced well, giving a exceptionally hard preprogrammed sound to the listener. Also about half of the CD is standard choir gospel type music. If you are a expecting a solid reggae album from track 1 until track 12 this isn't it. This is more of a praise and worship (musically) style CD. Listen to the samples first to see if you like this style of music."
4,"well organized, Langstroth","This appears to be a great reference (as a novice, don't really know). Well organized, lots of information. Note that the hive-specific items are aimed at Langstroth hives and routine USA bee care practices."
5,Welcome to the 4th Edition,This book is now in its 4th edition. That certainly tells you that it contains the essential information not only for beginning beekeepers but for all beekeepers. The diagrams are excellent and enhance the explanations in the text so that beekeepers not only read the information but see what they need to do. It is a book that all beekeepers will use for ready reference. It will be an excellent choice of textbook for bee courses on all levels. Those who have previous editions in their bee book collections will welcome the most current information in this 4th edition. I highly recommend this book to all beekeepers.
5,Great book for begining beekeepers,"This is a great book for any one who wants to learn how to keep bees. This book is covers every thing you need to know to get started. I recommend this book to any one who wants to learn about beekeeping. I also recommend that you also get ""Hive Management: A Seasonal Guide for Beekeepers"" by Richard E.Bonney, it makes a great companion book and covers everything you need to know that all of the beginners books do not."
1,Topsy Turvy!,"The binding is upside-down. While I don't ""hate"" it (it is still all there and readable), it wasn't what I was expecting.I love the book itself, I just was completely unprepared for the way it came."
2,Once the best,"Once the essential guide to beekeeping but no longer. Now there are numerous other books available that are visually easier to follow and understand. Alas, this book has become an out-dated text."
4,A must have for the beginner beekeeper!,"I am an amateur beekeeper and spend a great deal of my time reading every book I can find about beekeeping. This book is by far one of the better books, at least for me. It is more technical than many of the other books I've read, but not too much that I need a degree in entomology to understand. It would be nice if there were actual pictures rather than just illustrations, but the illustrations are nice. Each book I've read I've picked up some great piece of advice so if you're new to beekeeping read, read, read. I would recommend this on your reading list."
3,Good reference,"This book seems a better reference manual than beginning beekeeper's guide. There is a wealth of information in the book, but I didn't think it was fun to read. I would recommend Beekeeping for Dummies as a first book. The Beekeeper's Handbook may come in handy for researching problems but is not the best for someone thinking about starting as a beekeeper."
3,Great Band !! Poor Compilation Release,"I loved everything Possessed put out, but this I feel is lacking.This is suppose to be a ""Best Of"", and with only 10 songs ??Possessed was a great Death Metal band, They had more than 10 ""best of"" songs,and the cd could've held more than 10 tracks. The producers alsodid'nt bother to level off the sound,so there are tracks they are low inoutput and some louder than others.The packaging is not so great either. This was juts thrown together with no thought put in it, it's too bad.There however are some good songs on the cd, just not enough for a ""Best Of""Cd is worth the listen, but for collectors, it's not worth the 32-35 dollarrange sellers are asking. I would pay no more than 15.00."
4,Basic/No frills Generator Outlet,"There's not a lot to say about this, it is a basic 4 wire plug. I connected it within 5 minutes. The hardest part was stripping the wires to put into it."
4,Works perfectly,"Used this to make a cord connector for connecting a 3-wire generator outlet to a L14-30 4-wire transfer switch inlet.I didn't see ""reliance"" brand name on the plastic bag, but it did say ""Made in USA"".Tested the product for the intended use and there is no issue for me. So, no concerns with the brand name."
3,Bucks Fizz will always remain the unknown ABBA Wannabies!,"The rating of 3 is because the melodies are good, since they tried so hard to be like ABBA. It's fun music.....so dated unlike ABBA."
1,Bucks Fizz has fizzed out !!,"this C.D was a poor attempt of music. even worse than Proclaimers! (or was it?)I hated all the songs on this album because it was music for killing yourself because the music was too [stupid]!!Tell me why they ever won the eurovision song contest? they are just to happy and at the same time it's too freaky for a sane person like me, Darth Yopa the best critic in the whole internet(don't worry I write good reveiws sometimes! only if it is something I like)"
3,They Shouldn't Have Messed With The Book,"The novel, by Geoffrey Household, is well-paced and builds to a satisfying climax based on profound revelations. The movie pushes those revelations to the beginning, which robs the main character of his motivation to swing into action at the end. I enjoyed the movie to a point, but this is one of those cases where the film makers would have done better to stay more consistent with the book."
1,A word of warning about this release,"Being a great fan of Peter O'Toole, I was delighted when I discovered that one of his films I've wanted to see for a very long time had finally been released on dvd. Yesterday said dvd arrived at my place, and although I've had so far no time to watch the whole movie, I nevertheless checked the dvd with regard to quality. The result: The quality is just abonimable. The transfer seems to have been directly taken from a second or third generation (bootleg?) video cassette; the overall miserable quality not only of the picture (I've seen mpeg files that were better) but also of the sound even lets me suspect that what we hear and see on this dvd released by the ""Passion"" label is a recording of a VHS video playback (all I'm missing is someone's head suddenly appearing in front of the monitor and/or the sound of someone coughing). What this boils down to: All but the O'Toole fans most sturdy of heart - beware!"
2,Just don't watch this...,"... if you have read and love the book. All the psychology has been removed. Imagine reading the book with all the first person parts removed. Yes, it really is that bad.Vapid, terrible adaption of the original story."
4,Light nice scent!,"I wouldn't say it is my absolute favorite, but it has a nice light clean scent. My boyfriend enjoyed receiving this as a gift. And the price is right compared to most other related products. When I had received this the trigger appeared broken, and it wouldn't dispense anything. I contacted Amazon, and a free replacement came very quickly. Excellent service. I think it was a one-time fluke."
1,Not at all what i thought....,"It smells like a combination of Raid Roach Killer and I am not certain what but, this is a review of the product itself not the seller-"
4,great smell,love the smell bottle came a little damaged. but nothing to worry about.great job sending it so fast ..thanks a bunch
3,Not bad but much better alternatives out there,"It does smell different I give you that. But it is not as pleasant as say a summer fragrance such as Lacoste or Burberry Summer, nor a fall fragrance such as Armani Mania/Code.it is stuck somewhere in the spectrum of fragrances with it's unique soapy smell. Not my first choice by a long shot."
5,love it,never smelled this before only orderd cuz of the name and i am very pleased its a great scent will def buy again thank you .
2,Too Stong doesn't last,Very Strong when you put in on and last for only about half an hour and its gone would at least thing that it would smell longer but no.
4,Sweet ending,This cologne started out not to special at the first use and after a few uses I really think I wasted my money...however the scent seem to came alive when the content reached down to about half and now I'm loving every spray of it...it's not as strong and long lasting scent like say a versace...but it stays on you for most of the day and leaves passer by's with a sweet smelling fragrance...On a lighter side maybe i'll shake up the next bottle I buy before I start using it...lol...nice product though
1,FCUK Him,"Let me preface this brief review by saying I own 60+ bottles and growing. This is without a doubt the worst bottle I've had the displeasure of smelling. The smell is something out of this world, it's difficult to describe. Imagine sour, cheap, soapy notes that are so synthetic it hurts the nose. Man I don't know what fragrance these other reviewers are smelling but this is aweful. If you absolutely need an FCUK scent try FCUK Connect it's much better scent wise, even if the longevity is poor. I usually am pretty forgiving on my fragrance reviews since everyones nose is different but...DON'T BUY THIS. That's my good dead for the year."
3,Not so impressed,This is a fresh smelling cologne not over powering or too fruity but I would suggest this one for daytime use because of the lightness of its scent. It is fairly cheap so don't worry. It is not however a signature cologne that sharply stands out from the rest but due to its clean scent it will do. Step up your game without breaking your bank.
4,"Smells clean, women seem to like it","This has a clean scent, but just a warning, it is also very heavy and synthetic at the beginning. It may even give you a headache. But about 1-2 hours in, it'll start giving off a very pleasant scent. And the longer you wear it, the better it smells. Make sure to spray it early in the morning so you'll get the best of it during the meat of your day. I've gotten the most compliments from wearing this stuff (I also wear Le Male from Jean Paul Gaultier, CK Obsession, and Issey Miyake). I prefer the smell of Issey over fcuk by a long shot, but I don't seem to catch as many compliments with Issey, and I wear Issey very often (still my fav)."
3,Mixed feelings,"I bought this cologne on two premises; 1, the name is awesome. 2, it was cheap and reasonably reviewed. First impressions are that its a cool bottle, not a bad smell but reminds me of a bar of soap. Not necessarily a bad thing but not really what im looking for in a cologne. It also doesnt seem to last the longest, I start to lose the smell after a couple hours. Im used to A&F Fierce which lasts for DAYS. Im going to continue my search for reasonably priced colognes (under $30) that have a lasting scent."
2,Looks Good,"But doesn't work well without help, the spring (too weak) and short dowel don't keep a roll in place. I added a short 3/4"" piece of PVC and placed it over the dowel, without it, it's worthless as the roll will fall off when pulled."
2,"This is NOT the movie soundtrack, & recorded in a gymnasium.","The singers are uninspired and do NOT reflect the actual singing style of the time. Likewise for the musicians. It is nice, however, that they managed to dig up some of the actual tunes played on the ship. It's a shame their rendition sounds like the retired church ladies. Not worth my $5."
5,So that the World May Believe,Excellent review of the Catholic Church's faith and hope that all Christians may be one. The book provides an excellent framework of the progress that has already been made and the work that is still necessary. A very positive approach that will lead readers to seek the change of heart that will lead to unity.
3,Good idea... a bit short on particulars,"A very nice, heart warming read... with next to no substance at all. I bought this book hoping to find some expression within Roman Catholicism that was reaching for Christian unity beyond the Trent model of, ""bow to the Pope as king, or you're damned."" Of course, this book is much softer than Trent, and at least recognizes the reality of true Christians outside the confines of Rome, but the only solution presented is the one issued since the 10th century that sent the Eastern Orthodox packing, as well as the Reformers of the 16th century: bow to the Pope as king, and we'll let you eat with us. The wrapping is better, but the content is still pretty poor.It's a fluff book... but a pleasant fluff book."
5,Excellent historical fiction from a wonderful writer.,"Good King Harry was Giardina's debut novel but I didn't read it until after I had finished, and fallen in love with, her outstanding second historical novel, Storming Heaven and its sequel, The Unquiet Earth. I'd read that she'd made Henry V the subject of her first novel because she didn't think anyone wanted to read about hillbilly coal miners. I could understand that, but what really puzzled me is what a daughter of the Appalachian coalfields would find so interesting about British royalty.I borrowed Good King Harry from the public library mainly out of curiousity and by the end of the first page, realized that this too was one I needed to acquire for my collection.The answer to my question was of course, that Henry V was the beloved King of the commoners - Good King Harry. As with Giardina's other works, her talent for bringing history to life and her ear for language are flawless."
3,A book that makes human this unique British King&#65533;,"To those of us not as well versed in the British history of this time, the King Henrys either seem to blend together or get lost in the pending battle between Lancaster and York, but this novel makes Britain's King Henry V seem much more human than history traditionally depicts him. The author doesn't delve deeply enough into the Welsh history of the time, especially Owain Glyndwr, but finally makes readers understand what could have been Harry's motivations. This is a good book for history buffs as well as simply an entertaining novel for the rest of the readers. It left me with more questions than it answered, but in this instance that seemed a strength rather than a weakness."
4,Henry V -- the man and the king,"Giardina has done a marvelous job of getting us a richly textured portrait of Henry, the man as well as the king. So skilled is she that it's hard at times to know where history leaves off and her imagination takes off (for instance, Merryn was NOT an historic character, but Oldcastle was).I have to admit being just slightly disappointed that Henry's Agincourt speech paled in comparison to Shakespeare's famous ""band of brothers"" soliloquy, but that's to be expected.The main thing about this book is that you really begin to care about Harry and the people around him. You feel you understand him and even pity him. Of course, whether the real Henry V was as honorable is another whole matter. But if I wanted only facts, I would have checked the non-fiction section.A good rousing and yet thoughtful tale."
5,Excellent book,"I purchased this book a few years ago on a business trip. Since then, I have purchased 4 more books written by this author. She is an excellent writer and really brings her characters to life. Highly recommended."
4,Marketing Strategies for the Future,"Clear and well-written exploration of market share approach to marketing versus the one-to-one approach to marketing. Explained well, and backed up with solid and very applicable examples.It's important to remember that this book prepared the way for current Internet-based/personalized approaches to marketing. To a current marketeer, it may feel a bit dated (many of the examples are dependent on using snail mail and fax machines) but it given how many large IT projects are centered around database marketing, it's worthwhile reading for a lot of professionals and technical workers who may be missing part of the point of the systems they're developing."
5,Batman Beyon an exciting kid's favorite,"My children are very excited and fascinated with ""Batman Beyond."" Great cheap gift or good buy if your kids haven't yet discovered Batman Beyond. A sure hit."
4,it works,Good price...fast delivery and it's a must have for any bar. If your rimming alot of glasses you should also buy the replacement sponges...
2,Margarita glass rimmer,This item is difficult to open and contents spill between compartments. Also difficult to clean. No instructions came with.
4,Nice product,"This is a nice product. I haven't used it yet because we're planning on using it at our wedding reception to compliment our signature drink, but it just as i expected! Good buy for a reasonable price."
5,great accessory to any home bar,"I keep flavored sugars and salts for mixed drinks, this makes it super easy to put the salt or sugar on my glasses. fits a pint glass very well. Stacks nicely and doesn't take up a lot of room."
3,Juice section should be removable for washing.,"It's convenient, and I like the compact design and the idea. But the liquid/juice section should be removable for washing. I use flavored sugars/salts so I always save them. It would make it more convenient to be able to store them in this thing. I don't like going through the hassle of taking them out to wash the juice section each time. Not as sturdy as I would like, but sturdy enough for $9."
3,"basic kit, will get the job done","if you are looking for a basic tint install kit, this is it. besides lacking application fluid (soap) it has all the basic tools you need for an application. the drawback of this kit is that the bottle is small and the squeegee is a little too soft to do back glass with defrosters. for the money this is a great kit, and if you only plan to use it once, i would recommend this to the weekend tint-er."
4,Tint,"This product is dark, very dark. I used it to tint the back cap of my pick up truck. It is very hard to cut so use a very sharp razor. This is exactly what I wanted in the end a cheap DYI solution to my problem. Product works great."
4,A coffee table history of a departed era,"This lavishly illustrated book offers a concise history of the battleship from the end of the Age of Sail to the Iowa Class. Focusing on the world wars has been common in such books; this one also covers the pre-Dreadnaught era, and does it well. There are ample photos of the ships themselves, of scale models, and line drawings. The text was written by a lover of the big ships, as is evident in the section on H.M.S. Vanguard, the last British battleship, described as, ""a magnificant sea boat,"" that handled beautifully, without the lumbering movements of less aquadynamic vessels. Having been a lifelong fan of the battleship, and having made the pilgrimmage to Wilmington, N.C. to see U.S.S. North Carolina, I can say that this is one of the best books in the genre, and a good one for beginners who want a short, conplete history of ships the like of which we'll never see again."
3,"pretty good, close but no cigar.....","I build wooden model ships; pre-WW1 mostly. This book shows lots of ""large"" photos, (and small ones too), and they mostly show some good examples of what I need to see....but not in the detail I need. I need LOTS and LOTS of detail. For general shapes and sizes the book is pretty good. For the shape and size of the air intakes on the aft gun deck... not so good... You can go from there....."
3,A time passer,"If you're looking for a reality piece, this is not it. This is a movie for one of those days where one does not wish to think at all, and everything on the boob tube is too depressing. I will admit that buried in the core of this bit of fluff is a cautionary tale of Artificial Intelligence run amok, and if one dwells on that, the movie is as scary as the evening news. Otherwise, it's just a run-of-the-mill Disney formula family-needs-mother pic. The technology portrayed may, like that of Jules Verne, come to pass in the not too distant future. Much of it is available today, if one can afford it. I, for one, am not holding my breath."
5,Nostalgia!,"This movie is ridiculous as many DCOMs were, but it's hilarious. Not exactly film of the century, but very entertaining especially for me as I was the target audience when this movie originally came out."
1,"Lousy ""Innopocket"" hard case being sold as positively rated ""DSI"" hard case","The hard case shown for the Palm Tungsten E2 handheld is the one positively rated by reviewers as the ""DSI"" company hard case. BUT, the ONLY hard case that is shipped by ""wireless galaxy"", is the LOUSY(rated by one of the 3 reviewers) ""Innopocket"" company hard case, for $19.99. This is like a ""bait and switch"" situation, with a great ""DSI"" company hard case reviewed and SHOWN in the picture, but in the fine print of ""comments"" about the hard case being sold by ""wireless galaxy"", the hard case for the Palm Tungsten E2 being shipped is the LOUSY Innopocket company hard case that was given a very poor rating by one of the reviewers. (as of 4:10am(ET) Saturday 22 July 2006)"
5,Handy little item!,"Great product to have around when needed! I teach health careers and I also perform some school nurse duties for our school. Often times kids get rings on their fingers and can't get them off, this is one handy little item to have in your medical bag!"
4,"Does what it's supposed to, at least once","It works. It cuts most rings. I'm a paramedic and have used it a few times already. It easily and safely cuts through gold and silver but steel or any hard metal and it is ruined. Even after the first soft gold ring, I noticed it lost some strength and was not as effective. It's cheap enough it could be disposable though. Also, the hand crank can be very hard to turn when deep n a ring. I will buy again and have recommended this product to coworkers."
1,Ring cutter,Puece of junk. The wheel kept slipping out of the groove pinching the patient. Applied pressure only warped the wheel. Crap product. Doesn't warrant one starADC Premium Ring Cutter
2,Finally most of Artless' discography available on one CD!,"For years I've read Mykel's articles in Maximum Rock n Roll and I've heard Artless mentioned countless times in that zine. I finally picked up this disc and enjoyed it. They were real innovative and used instruments such as a metronome and a tuba. If your a fan of old school punk with funny and political lyrics then these guys are worth supporting. I am disappointed however that Artless' cover of ""I Touch Myself"" by the Divinyls didn't make it to the CD, due to the pressing plant being pr*ckish and not letting them put any covertunes on their record."
4,"Exellent sound, good picture quality.","At the price I paid, this is an excellent although not perfect blu-ray experience. I've only listened to the stereo LPCM track of both the acoustic and electric shows and they sound great. Maybe I just wasn't following along as intently to the electric set as I was to the acoustic show but oddly it didn't seem to have the same energy or immediacy of the non-electric. You'd think it would have been the reverse. Somehow I enjoyed the songs more during the acoustic show. I'm not a huge Pixies fan but find their style and sound enjoyable for the most part so I really enjoyed this blu-ray overall. While the sound seems up to snuff, the video is not always ""blu-ray pristine"" but it's never horrible either."
2,Too much flash animation for my likeing,Would have been better without all the flash and they should have had more artists. I wouldn't have paid more than 5 dollars for it.
3,Mixed bag,"I found most of the shorts in this compilation to be too ""in your face"". Style over substance in a way."
2,"OK product, cheap quality","We bought these goggles a few years ago, when they were called iWear, to use with the video iPod. The picture quality was so-so, and they're not comfortable to wear, but we figured it would work OK for our patients. At some point one of the ear buds went dead; by that time the product was out of warranty.About 2 years into its use one of the legs broke off, not at the hinge as one would expect but actually the plastic part of the goggle body itself. We glued it together with plastic cement, bot a month later the other leg broke off, in pretty much same place. We glued it again, but then it broke again in a new place, not where we glued it. Conclusion: the quality of plastic the goggle body is made of is way too cheap. So, overall, we would not recommend this product, and are currently looking into a different brand to replace the one we had."
2,had to be returned. Not at all what I was thinking i was getting,The husband asked for these but was not at all happy once he got them and tried them out. I'm not sure if it was because he usually wears glasses and they didn't focus for him or what but I had to send them back.
1,can be way better,"the earplugs fall off, the quality isn't that good.and i can't play it on my ipod with the delivered cable."
2,"Looks great at first, then quickly fades in the sunshine","I used this outdoors on metal and plastic in order to more easily see low posts and utility boxes when backing out my car. The areas were first primed/undercoated with KILZ oil-based spray primer.After a few weeks, the Rust-Oleum began to noticeably fade. Now, two months later, the yellow is almost gone from the surfaces subjected to direct sunlight. The white KILZ undercoating shows no signs of fading, I would add."
2,Disappointing,"I might recommend this specialty paint to a jogger because it's Runny. On the other hand I wouldn't recommend this paint to somebody in the office football pool because it doesn't cover. If it even approximated the bright, neon orange color on the lid, I'd be satisfied. It doesn't. Instead I got a subdued fluorescent orange with plenty of the painted object showing through.To give it every chance to shine, I used this Rust-oleum on wood, metal, cardboard, and a Mr. Potato Head. Results on all are unimpressive. I can only hope this review helps someone from making the same mistake I did."
2,Not fluorescent pink (maybe really bright salmon?),"I was hoping for a bright, shiny bubblegum pink to match the fluorescent pink duck tape you can get now. This is not that. It's kind of a bright deep salmon or coral colour -- which is not helped by the completely flat finish. I hated the colour so much I spent hours sanding it off my project."
1,SUPERSONIC SPEEDWAY ITEM #ON BOX IS 5980,I RECENTLY BOUGHT A FASTLANE SUPERSONIC SPEEDWAY ITEM #5980 ... FOR MY GRANDSON. IT COVERS AN ENTIRE EIGHT FOOT TABLE WITH DOUBLE TRACKS AND DOUBLE LOOPS FOR THE CARS WHICH ARE NOT ELECTRICAL BUT ARE PROPELLED BY MECHANICAL MEANS. AFTER SPENDING HOURS TRYING TO GET IT ASSEMBLED I STILL HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO MAKE IT WORK. I FEEL THIS IS NOT THE QUALITY OF ITEM I EXPECT FROM [TRU]...
3,Was There a (Manuscript) Doctor in the House?,"Interesting, but poorly edited: too many misspellings and grammatical errors detract from admirable account of author's travails in getting the movie made; her clear dislike of the film's director amounts to ""telling tales out of school.""The film was successful; she would have been better off forgiving the director's derelictions and hiring a decent manuscript editor."
3,"Maybe the best in a small genre, but not satisfying","I talk and act for a living (yep, I'm in a sort-of sales position), so I wasn't as excited about this book after reading it as I thought I'd be. Some good exercises that are included just didn't strike me as too much different that a day working with a people with varying knowledge, maturity, and educational levels.Maybe I got [pulled] into the idea that (1) I like improv comedy, and (2) I'm always interested in some self-improvement. But I get to laugh and learn everyday just by showing up at the office at 8:00 a.m.If you are in a serious, stuffy workplace that could use some fun and constructive play, this book might be more enjoyable than it was for me."
1,Disappointed!,"I was hoping to find some activities in working with groups and with improvisation. I wanted to find some tools to improve my own skills in improv. For me this book offered neither of these. The writing was rather bland and I had trouble just getting through the book. If you really want it, I would look for used copies."
2,"Spontaneity, Play and Having Fun","The authors have attempted to teach what most of us having reached adulthood and in the corporate world has forgotten - spontaneity, play and having fun. Some of the playshops would form a good basis for team building.Forms an interesting read but did not break new ground. You might learn more from talking to playschool teachers who are in touch with the masters of spontaneity, play and having fun every day - young children!"
2,didn't increase my occupancy.,Book seems to be for apartment managers. I manage single family homes and found little that applied to me.I got it used for a buck and 4 for shipping. I would get my money back but it would cost me five to get my one back. I'll throw it away.some times you don't win.
2,"Great book, poor printing quality","This is no doubt a great book, but the printing quality is really really poor. The copy at the library is much better, i suspect that this is not printed by the original publisher. The color illustrations looks poor quality, letters sometimes broken. One page is even printed upside-down!"
1,Did not get this book,"I returned this book due to I did not need this book, so I did not use or look at this book."
2,???,"I like Steve Vai. I love Devin Townsend.I, however, don't especially like this album. Their are some great parts, and some humourus parts, but overall there is about the same amount of bad as good... which is really not what I look for in music.If you like great guitarwork and screams taht sound like someone is ripping their throat out with air, then you'll like about half of this album, while the other half is odd little ""SHAKAZULU"" chants and weird stuff like this."
3,the bio says it all,"Vai's bio here says it all: ""their one and only album in 1993, Sex & Religion. When the album proved to be a disappointment both critically and commercially,""... and well deservidly so.I guess Vai is allowed a stunt, and I hope he doesnt release a vocal album ever again; a few songs here and there I might tolerate. My advice is to skip this one unless you are a hard core fan."
1,Why the singing ?,"I bought this CD long ago, but then everytime i try to listen to it, the CD pops out of my player after 10 minutes because ...the singing is just unbearable. I tought Steve Vai had understood that what we liked was his awesome playing ( Like in ""Passion and warfare"") but then he try to put a traditional band and it fails for good. Even his riffs seems to be taken from early 80's heavy-metal band. The drums are good and solo's as usual but they aren't any grasping song like ""sisters"" on this one. Too bad, i liked what you did Steve. Please come back on earth and don't give us things like ""earth dwellers return"" anymore..."
5,Bennett Teaches Our Children Well,"William Bennett has compiled a wonderful collection of American folktales, songs and speeches to make all American children feel good about themselves and their country. The unintentional irony of juxtaposing Martin Luther King's ""dream"" speech with blatantly racist folksongs is typical of Bennett's charmingly naive and confused view of morality and virtue. The inclusion of songs and stories promoting racial harmony appears to have been driven by a simple-minded sense of political correctness.But Bennett nonetheless succeeds in providing the children of America with a much needed lesson in patriotism and morality. God knows that the public has completely lost their sense of morality.Thank you, Mr. Bennett, for teaching my children what is good and virtuous."
1,A Children's Book from a Racist!,"Earlier this week Mr. Bennett stated on his radio program that aborting every black baby in America would lower the crime rate in America.How do we illustrate THAT in a children's book?Don't buy anything from this gambling, lying racist. Especially for your kids, please."
4,American history,"We purchased this book to introduce a 6 yr old to American history, and we found it to be a good beginning for that. However, the editing by Simon & Schuster leaves much to be desired. The Contents page is erroneously numbered. This is frustrating to a child or even an adult trying to locate the proper page per topic. Hopefully the error will be corrected in future editions.Despite the problem, I would recommend purchasing this book."
1,so sad:(,"This book looked like someone had left it out in the rain, it had mold in it. I was sooo very disapointed."
3,What To Make Of It?,"You know, it's strange. I knew exactly what to make of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, but several other strange titles puzzle me, this one included.After reading Freddy's Book and Grendel, I can only assume Gardner's intent is to focus his novels on philosophical nihilism and the Medieval time period. I doubt ""On Moral Fiction"" focuses on either of these subjects, but I don't think I'm going to take that chance.I don't get why Freddy's Book is called King Gustav and the Devil instead of Lars Goren and the Devil. Lars Goren is the main character, but Bishop Brask seems to be the character that's best defined.Really, this book isn't about plot or character, it's about exploring philosophy without any intention of getting anywhere. Anyway, it left me feeling kind of empty."
4,a good read,"This novel is a soothing and comforting story of farm family in Maine. The main character is Jen Shaw, a young woman lving with her family in a small community during the 1920's, I think.This book is the Waltons meet Ethan Frome, depicting a year in the life of a family that more and more face the modern world of air planes, college educations, and city life.The characaters are sympathetic, strong and human. The chronicle of farm living's chores, rituals, and tasks are fascinating."
3,Bernard Jensen Alfalfa Tablets,"I just reordered this product and haven't received it yet, but the last container has quite a lot of broken tablets in it, so it really needs to be packaged better. Other than that, I really like this brand, and the price is good."
5,Dr. Smith,Dr. Smith is very knowledgable where the Bible and Bible history is concerned. I've always enjoyed his classes at CFBC and FCC as well as at the churches I've attended where he has classes.
4,Great insight into early valley life and the Young family!,"I recommend this book to those who are interested in the life of the early settlers of the Elk and Kanawha Valley area. As one of MANY Young descendants, I found it fascinating and very informative. The writer makes this a very enjoyable read."
3,WRONG BOOK,"I THOUGHT I WAS GETTING A BOOK ABOUT MY 7TH GRANDFATHER, I READ IT WRONG AND AS SOON AS I GOT IT, I KNEW I WAS WRONG.I READ THE BOOK ANYWAYS & IT WAS QUITE INTERESTING. THE MATERIAL COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER RESEARCHED."
4,Decite voice if you like falsetto.,"Terry Huff was not the best falsetto of his era, but he most certainly was a good singer. This is a rare find, and I Destroy Your Love is a classic. I highly recommend this for those that are fans of the male falsetto voice. Would've given it 5 stars, but some of the tracks on this album could've been better I feel."
1,weak,"Musea have released some very good ""Un Voyage En Progressif"" disks over the years, but this compilation is very poor in comparison. The bands I haven't heard of (which is most of the bands on the CD) are awful, the production quality on some of the songs are equally poor. Even the bands I've heard and liked before (Quidam, Halloween, Cafeine) have poor tracks on this disk. If the CD title hasn't clued you in, this CD is all French bands sung in French. Normally that won't deter me if the music is good (ala Nemo). If you're after value-priced prog compilation CDs with good bang, check out Musea's Un Voyage En Progressif Volume 5, 7, or 9 instead for starters. They are also sung in mostly English lyrics as well."
5,A Reliable Introduction to an Exotic Land,"Guide books to Ethiopia are few and far between. However, the Spectrum Guide is all you will need to get an accurate glimpse into this far-away and often misunderstood land just now beginning to be touristed by the outside world.There are section that cover almost every aspect of Ethiopian life: places, history, geography, food, art, religion, visitors' needs, wildlife, are just a few. The book is profusely illustrated with 200 gorgeous full-color photos abounding from practically every page.If you are planning a trip to Ethiopia or just interested in learning about the culturally-3000 year old part of our world, once known as Abyssinia, then do pick up the Spectrum Guide to Ethiopia and get carried away to the exotic!"
1,Spectrum Guide to Ethiopia,I have always been impressed by the quality of the used books that I ordered from Amazon until today. This was the first time that I received a book that really felt used. It's not in really bad shape and the price was still OK. However a photograph was cut out of it and I'm assuming that the seller didn't notice this.
5,Any Zao fan must have,Love this band the very first cd I ever owned was splinter... very entertaining documentary with three great live shows very good
5,comperhensive,"i had this book for three years , still can not find a single book that even comes close to it.excellent book. more than enough illustrations, simple and straight forward to the point yet suffeciently explained, specially workouts, stances ,basic and advanced techniques.if you are looking for a book that saves you time , money and the effort of going through many other books i strongly recommend that you get ""Karate: The Art of Empty-Hand Fightingby Hidetaka Nishiyama"" the best single Karate book ever written"
5,For a solid foundation....,"I study Tae Kwon Do. Our style is based on Shotokan Karate. This book is excellent for the beginner, and for people who want to brush up on their techniques. This book shows how to properly use your hands with all the different hand punches, chops and stabs, and shows all the kicks that we use. It even has throwing techniques. I understand the author was a shotokan legend - this book, well worth every penny."
4,Close your eyes and enjoy the Panorama,"Richly textured and well produced (perhaps a bit overly so at times), Craig's music engulfs you. While very relaxing, its nuances and interesting modalities keep it interesting in your head while restful in your heart. With the exception of his `tip of the hat' to his old Starship days in `Find Your Way Back', which kind of sounds silly in this context (and my CD player is set to skip), every track is a Panorama. Definitely, a 5-star effort if it weren't for `Find You Way Back', and what some might call heavy-handed production. I give it a 4 (but I guess I'm rounding downward)."
3,Works well enough,Works well. Looks nice. I wish there was some indicator that time was up besides the tiny flag. It's also a little tricky to stop the clock.
2,Disappointed,"I bought the timer as a gift for a budding chess player. I opened the completely plain white box without even any writing and found the timer... and that was it. No instructions on how it works, no contact information, no nothing. It looks ok but feels pretty cheap when working the buttons in the back. Well, the person I gave it to is still trying to figure out how to use it. Guess you get what you pay for."
4,Christmas suprise,I bought a chess clock for my 12 year old son for Christmas it arrived on time and I wrapped it right away. When he opened it Christmas morning 3 days later it was broken. I called and left a message with the House of Staunton they called me back Monday morning and they sent me a new clock no charge to me and so far my son has not had a problem with the clock. Thank you.
2,Nasty suprise,"The clock is mechanical. I did not know they are still made, so I did not pay attention that in the description no batteries were mentioned... Why not state the fact clearly? I purchased it and now have to wind it up every day. I also have to put it far from my bed not to listen to ticktacks, which are rather loud. The only good thing about this clock is its turn-off button, which is big, visible and easily accessible."
2,All New Stereo Re-records,"Rated the artwork and packaging 4 stars, content 1 star.All this is to hard to listen too. Not much else to say. Only 9 tracts per disc which is just fine and adds a little more salt to put into your wounded pocketbook.You should save your money."
2,"Whew, I'm glad it's over!","I have read many of Robert's books and have been very entertained by all, but I have to agree with some of the others, this book was so boring. It took me months to finish this one, whereas It usually takes me a few weeks to finish her books. The plot and characters were just dull and predictable. I will however continue with Nora, this was my first dislike of all that I have read, afterall she can't please all of us!"
2,oh sooooo dissappointing...,"Reading the synopsis one would never guess Nora could dissappoint. I absolutely love all her books but I could barely finish this one.. If only she would have given more depth to the characters, I reall couldn't feel for any of them... I wanted so much better."
4,Homeport,"""Homeport"" tells the story of Dr. Miranda Jones, a cold-on-the-outside but warm-on-the-inside art historian whose family name is synonomous with art and relics. Her parents are cold and remote, but all the same she has entered the family business and has carved out a name of her own. Into this scenario steps Ryan Boldari, a handsome, charming, family man who happens to be an art thief. Together he and Miranda must find out who is trying to steal a priceless statue and ruin the Standford-Jones reputation.This book provided a wonderful romantic story, with a strong heroine and an equally strong (not sappy) hero in Ryan. Some of the most heartwarming parts were the most realistic -- Ryan taking Miranda home to dinner with his family, Miranda simultaneously heartbroken for and furious at her alcoholic brother Andrew (in fact, I'd love to see a sequel on Andrew sometime). All in all this was a very enjoyable read."
4,My First Nora Roberts Book,"I selected Homeport at a book store on the Outer Banks, NC during vacation simply because it's set in Maine (a favorite place of mine) and had a lighthouse on the front cover! Although detailed and slow-paced in some places, Homeport has started me on a mission to read all of Nora Roberts' books! (So far I've read the Quinn brothers' trilogy (Inner Harbor, Rising Tides and Sea Swept) - and I rate this trilogy 5 stars because it's refreshing to have male characters featured in a romance series, Enchanted, and am now reading Daring to Dream. All of her books have been good escape reading with laughs, intrigue and romance thrown in."
3,Not My Favorite,"Normally I can't put Nora Robert's novels down, but with Homeport I actually had trouble picking it up. Miranda Jones was just not a likeable character to me. She lacked depth, personality, and most of all heart. Now, I am used to Nora Roberts having strong female leads with some kind of chip on their shoulder and the ""I don't need a man to make me complete"" attitude, but Miranda didn't even play that off well. The rest of the characters in the book were just as boring and shallow. The only one that I really liked was Ryan Boldari, Miranda's nemesis and love interest. He actually had personality and a wonderful sense of humor. Besides the characters being lame, though, the plot jumped around a lot and some of the smaller stories weren't developed enough to be believable and/or even interesting. I will definitely still read Nora Roberts, but this won't be on my favorites list."
2,Annoying women disgust me,"I love romance, but Nora, enough. Why do female authors feel the need to make their leading ladies stupid. Seriously? I'm embarassed to read these women make so many mistakes. After a while, all you want to do is throw the book into a raging fire. I consider myself a woman of intelligence so reading about women who don't even have common sense, but have doctorates is insulting. YOU'RE A WOMAN NORA! Why would you want to deface us? Ugh. I want the last three hours back. And ever thing that these books can be condensed? More words do not make a better novel. So skip this long-winded mystery. It made me begin to hate Nora's writing and find another novelist, so for now,onto a new author.The ONLY thing that was at all redeeming was Ryan the thief. His description, actions and words really excite us as a reader. Hey Nora: how about you make a female character like that?"
4,Good book.,"This was my introduction to Nora Roberts and I found the book very interesting. She is called a ""romantic"" writer, but this book had mystery and intrigue and that is what I like. My one criticism is that I had hoped for a better resolution to the mother-daughter conflict. A simple pat on the shoulder or a hug or a compliment on how Miranda organized the art show would have done it for me, and I imagine for the many others who wanted some resolution to that conflict."
4,"Suspense, intrigue... and steamy romance -- I love it!","Although author Nora Roberts is considered a romance writer, this particular novel has suspense, intrigue, mystery . . . and hot, steamy romance. The contrast between the stiff-upper-lip, high-bred female lead and the warm, italian passion of the male lead leaves no doubt that steamy nights are ahead. Throw in high-tech thievery, art forgery, and murder and you have the perfect recipe for a ""nail bytin'"" good time."
5,Had me hooked from the first page!!!!!!,"Ms. Roberts has done it again! This is one of her best. Contemperary, smart, trilling, romantic adventure."
4,Nora Roberts does it again!,"I can't think of a Nora Roberts book I haven't enjoyed. I am always amazed that she can capture my interest every time. This book not only gives the thrill of romance, it gives you an insight to the world of art, art history and art science. I loved it. Thanks Nora!"
2,Disappointed for the first time with Nora Roberts,"While normally a fan of Nora Roberts, I was disappointed in the pace and the weak personality of her 'heroine' as opposed to the unrealistic persona of her 'hero. Dr Jones is given a lot of good credentials but no common sense. Ryan Boldari is given smoldering sexuality but the manners of a suave caveman. The storytelling was not up to its usual flew-through-the-pages mode. It could have been better."
1,Slow..........So very slow...........,This book was one of the hardest books to get into and finish. I love Nora Roberts books and am always excited about reading them but this one took me forever to read and I had to force myself to finish it. The best part of the book was the ending.
3,Not my favorite..............,This is probably my least favorite NR book to date. It does start off slow but it eventually picks up. I had a hard time really getting into these characters. The story itself is ok but overall there was just not enough there for me to give a higher score..........sorry Nora!
1,Booooorrring!,"It was so hard to get into this book. The beginning was dull, even with the attack. I havent even finished the book. I happily tossed it to the side, after trying again to read on. No luck. It's collecting dust as I type this. This was my first Nora Roberts book and I was deeply disappointed. I will stick with Barbara Delinsky."
1,Nora's Worst Work ever.,"I generally like Nora's work, but found this book extremely disappointing. I kept reading, thinking it has to get better...WRONG!!!! This book was horrible, it was almost like reading someone other that Nora Roberts. Maybe she was having an off day when she wrote this book, everyone is entitled to one, let's just hope all the off days are OVER!!!!! I bought this book because of the on-line reviews, silly me, next time I will use my own judgment."
2,an okay read,not one of my favorite Nora Roberts' books. It did not keep my attention - not enough conflict.
3,well...,"Love Nora, she's my favorite. But this one, not my favorite. It was a slow start, I had to make myself keep reading it. It picked up the pace in the middle and I started to really enjoy it. But, as with some other Roberts novels I've read, I just was not buying the ""bad guys"" motive. This one was a stretch. I found myself just thinking, ok, there's got to be more to it then that. But there wasn't.But I still love Nora, she's the best! Pick up any of her ""series"" books, like the Irish Trilogy or the Chesapeake Bay saga, those are wonderful!"
1,disappointed,"I've been a fan of Nora Robert's for more than 10 years. Most of her books I've read multiple times, and enjoyed each re-reading. This one I read once, and barely finished it. The characters lacked the depth that one expects from Nora Roberts. She thrust them into danger and, instead of sitting on the edge of my seat in suspense, I really didn't care what happened to them. The characters in some of her early Silhouette novels have more depth and personality than what's-his-name and what's-her-name from this book."
1,"Not very well developed, particularly at the end.","I was initially interested in how the author would resolve the book considering the main character fell in love with a thief. The ending, however, was particularly disappointing. The author resolved the story in a way that had little to do with the rest of the book and included family relationships that were not developed well. Furthermore, the conclusion of the book was simplistic and unrealistic to say the least. Although I recognize that people do not read romance novels because they are realistic, I have certainly read romance novels that were better developed and more thought-provoking."
3,My first Roberts read,"I was given this book as a gift for Christmas, and I must say, it's not in my usual genre. I usually read historical romances, but do enjoy other types of novels. This book held my interest pretty well, but I found the dialogue unnatural and strained and the characters trite, although I did enjoy Ryan Boldari. Even Ryan's family were caricatures! My biggest criticism of Ms. Roberts is that she ""tells"" instead of ""shows"", a real rookie mistake and quite aggravating to intelligent readers."
2,Too Long - Again,"Another endless book from Nora Roberts, although this one only took me two weeks to finish, instead of three months. It was ridiculous having a thief for a hero, and being an Irish-Italian person myself, I found the descriptions of the Boldari family unrealistic and insulting. I didn't find Ryan all that charming, and found the love/sex scenes sort of silly in their wording, which is my typical reaction to this author, so I skipped over most of them, not to mention that neither character seemed sexy. The only reason I'm awarding a second star is because I like the locations where the story was set."
1,A very boring book.,I find it interesting that so many people that have reviewed this book enjoyed it so much. I got halfway through the book and couldn't go on because nothing was happening. Nora Roberts is one of my favorite authors however I found this book very disappointing.
3,I Believe(D) In You!,"I was so excited when I bought this single... I really love the origianl version and I was anxious to hear the remixes but I was so dissapointed, the remixes are not good that good at all...The Mylo Vocal Mix- sounds like a video game and there's no chorus!The Skylark Mix - is just music with her vocals saying ""I believe in you, and if you ever had to go away"" that's all.Then only stand outs on the single are the original version (which you can get on THE ULTIMATE KYLIE cd) and the video which is not like a regular Kylie video but it's still nice and the picture for the cover."
5,This single was written by Scissor Sisters!,"Kylie Minogue, the most talented singer from Australia, has teamed up with Jake Shears and Babydaddy of Scissor Sisters for this amazing single! It's full of disco beats and electronic synthesizers! It's so good, you'll want to hear it again and again. Music like this makes me smile. I believe in Kylie and I think you should get this now!"
5,Not stupid at all,"Scott Graham seems to have missed the point of the ""hog calling"". To put it in is not stupidity on the producer's side, it is just following the instructions of Hildegard. You can't expect the devil to have a pleasant voice, at least not according to medieval belief. This is not music you are supposed to fall asleep to. Sequentia does an excellent interpretation. Highly recommended!"
4,Ravishingly simple music,"To be honest, I have not heard this CD; however, I saw Sequentia perform Ordo Virtutum on their last tour and was stunned. The music is absolutely beautiful. Because the music lacks a melody, the focus is on the beauty of the human (mostly soprano) voice, and Sequentia withstands this scrutiny. Although Ordo Virtutum has been touted as the first opera, and does contain some character roles, its main appeal is as pure music. Listening to this qualifies as a spiritual experience."
5,Wonderful book,Great books for baseball fans like this one are hard to find in most bookstores. I purchased this book for a teenager interested in baseball history and he absolutely loved it!
3,"Columbia Sportswear Unisex Hemlock Ridge Pullover,",It's made from a comfotable material but it does not have a hem string so it tends to hang too loosely when worn as a outer garment.Works nicely when worn as an inner garment
3,One annoying thing...,"It is soft and fleecey and it looks good. The charcoal is a very nice color. The problem is that there's no hand warmer pocket in the front. I know, I know...I should have looked closer. Well, I didn't, and now whenever I wear it, I find myself trying to put my hands into a front pocket that isn't there.Another slightly annoying thing is that the wrist cuffs are pretty tight, so if you try to push your sleeves up to do something, it can be somewhat uncomfortably tight.On the positive side, it is a nice warm underlayer and is a clean, casual look with jeans. I like it, I just wish it had pockets."
4,Feels Nice,"I bought this for my father for Christmas and he loves it. It's super soft, but the arms are a little long for him. He's about 5'8"" which is a little short for a male. So if your height is below average, take the sleeve length into consideration."
4,better than expected,"As we're accustomed to, we received this shipment fast and in perfect condition. The amp performs a little better than expected for the price. I would reccomend it as a good practice tool."
3,What a disaster of an ending!,"This is a great book up until the last two chapters. Then, the whole plotline becomes so artificial and tedious! Once again as in the previous book, there is a Deus ex Machina completely unrelated to what already has happened just to force the book to end.Nevertheless, the rest of the book is worth 5-stars and is a much better book than Bearing an Hourglass."
3,needs editor to proof read,The story line is great. Characters are believeable in their depth. The only draw back is the constant spelling and typographical errors in this edition.
3,Kindle edition rife with errors,"This is a good book, but the Kindle edition was clearly made by scanning the pages with OCR and then not proofreading. There are so many typos. Some make it difficult to understand the text, and others make for unintentional comedy: ""The vision of the huge spider had Anally convinced her that Atropos meant business""- clearly that capital A was meant to be ""fi"", but ouch."
4,Good Incarnations book,"While not the best of the Incarnations series, it is still a solid read - but then, the entire Incarnations series (if you don't count book 8) are all great reads. This was actually the second book I read (after Being a Green Mother, both books I read about 10 years ago) so I was a bit confused with some of the events. But now having read books 1 and 2, I can appreciate and understand this book much better.The idea of three women having to share one body at all times is daunting. I can understand sharing it in the mortal world, but it seems that in the magical world or their home on the web, it seemed more logical to me that they should be able to separate into three bodies to conduct their respective duties more efficiently. Still, this is a great book, and a solid addition to the Incarnations series, with the usual mix of comedy and philosophy/thought-provoking passages (and outsmarting Satan himself)."
3,"Not the most enjoyable in the series, but worth a read","What if death, time, fate, war, nature, evil and good were not mere concepts but offices held by actual people, like any other occupation?Although initially opposed to her arranged marriage to a 16-year old, 21-year-old Niobe accepts and eventually grows to love her husband Cedric. When Cedric sacrifices his life in place of a death that was meant for her, Niobe, heartbroken, accepts an invitation to become Clotho, the youngest aspect of the immortal incarnation of Fate, whose responsibility it is to weave the threads in the great tapestry of life. While learning her new role, Niobe also learns that she herself has become entangled in the insidious plots of Satan, the incarnation of Evil.I haven't enjoyed books 2 and 3 nearly as well as On a Pale Horse, the first in the series."
5,Absolutely Wonderful,"This was the first of the Incarnations books that I read, and fell in love with the series within the first couple of chapters. I was already a Piers Anthony fan, loving the Xanth series, but this series is much more mature and has deeper plots and characters than the light Xanth books do. You feel for the characters, come to love them, and this is what happened when I began reading about Niobe and her life. Honestly, this book has changed and influenced my life in a many ways, and silly as that may sound.While this is a stand-alone novel, much like Anthony's other series books, I highly suggest reading this one begining to end--it will help with understanding some of the later books, as this is one series that is incredibly interwoven."
4,A worthwhile Read,"I have read a few of the ""Christmas In My Heart"" Books, and I find each one worthwhile. Although the stories are very sentimental, Christmas, more than any other time of year, is a sentimental season. Probably the greatest asset of this collection (and the other volumes)is the diversity of the stories. The stories range from ones that can be shared with small children (""Small Things"") to ones adults would enjoy (""Pandora's Books"" in this volume and ""Meditation in a Minor Key"" in volume 1). While most of the stories are quite old (19th century/early 20th), there are also more recent ones (""Matthew, Mark, Luke,and John"" - post Korean War). Each story is deeply moving and refocuses the reader's attention from the hassle of shopping and writing cards to the true meaning of Christmas. The stories are inspirational and heart warming."
5,very good condition,"Very satisfied, was shipped in timely manner and in good shape. Would order from them again."
5,Great book,Easy to read and gives a keen insight to how warren buffet selects his investments. Great for intermediate investors.
3,good book for beginners,"This is a useful starting book for beginners who like to dig gold in the stock market. It tries to sell its ideas including ""long term investment"",""selective contrarian strategy""and ""durable competitive advantage"", which I found quite useful. The earlier a beginner reads, the more he will benefit.However, the drawbacks are also obvious. The word ""New"" doesnot really represent a really new buffettology; and it is too wordy. The length of the book can be reduced to at least 70% of its length now. Some of the sentences have been repeated by too many times.(which is just to make the book thicker, and more expensive:P)All_in_all, it is a 3-4 stars book and especially good for beginners. A useful but not a great book."
5,A little bit goes a LONG way,"who has time to read tons of in-depth investment books? not i, for one. the beauty of this, well, little beauty is that while it isn't for the professional, and even a dummy could ""get"" it--it is original enough, convincing enough, and compelling enough a vehicle for any investor to embark on making money slowly, consistently, and successfully by any yardstick. i read the first Buffettology with much gratification, and, hard to believe, this is even better--MUCH better. the authors do it again, with nary a repetition. all-in-all, a crystal clear tour de force in a nutshell. this comes as close to the holy grail of non-highly technical literature within its discipline as anything i have ever seen."
4,"Value Investors, Pay attention","The Buffettolgy scheme could sound very simplistic to some, or just boring to others, but out of experience, the lessons of this book are the fundamental basis for a real long term and wealth building investment process. For those who believe in the get rich quick with some colorful charting approaches this book may sound too simple to be true.The essence of this book is to find stocks that stand the test of ""Durable Competitive Advantage"" with a careful and simple approach and plenty of examples. It is worth reading if you are a novice investor, but if you are not, then you will need to skip this book.Book Strengths: Simple approach, good examplesBook Weaknesses: Short in theory"
4,Intimate glimpses of Big Bend National Park over the years,"""For All Seasons"" is wonderful complement to a journey to Big Bend for any nature lover. Through reading Ro Wauer's book, I got a clear understanding of what a park naturalist's work entails. The work is a paradoxical blend of solo time hiking in the mountains, inventorying plant and animal species, along with leading tourists on nature walks around the campground. It was on one of the latter that the famous ""poodle story"" took place - more I will not say.""For All Seasons"" works equally well as a preparation for a trip to Big Bend, reading while at the park, or a companion to reminisce with on return. Wauer knows both the heavily visited and nearly inaccessible corners of the park, and makes you his companion on his journey."
1,do they have spell check at Bumper Art?,"They must be churning these bumper stickers out at a high rate to spit this out. ""Teat"" your children? Heavens!"
1,I'm not sure as I thought I am going to get the re-fund,I got an email saying the sender is going to give me a re-fund as the order was late and no other stock available. I need to check if a re-fund is deposit back to my visa card. I do not need the book anymore. Thanks!
4,Just Like Mary,This was bought for our church library. Children love this type of book to check out. I showed it to my grandchildren ages 3 to 8 and they like what they saw.
3,nice little book,Purchased for my daughter who is going through first communion classes. She is 8 and a good reader. It's a nice little book albeit a bit immature for her. But it's nice to have a book which introduces Mary to little girls.
4,Hard to Find at a Good Price,I love this shampoo but its hard to find at decent price. Forget trying to find it in a store!
4,Showing my City,The book is perfect to describe Bogota and show every one around the world another face about Colombia and specifically Bogota. Also it is and excellent skill to describe a define places into the city.
1,Just slightly below par,"My mother-in-law and I both fell in love with the Bar Cynster series this author prviously wrote. You know it must have been good if your mother-in-law calls you long distance to talk about these books. There was not enough information in the beginning of this book to make the formation of this group of men in any way plausable. For myself it was a little hard to believe that these characters fell in love. There was not enough spoken and physical interaction between the two main characters.I have bought and read the second book in this series. It was better than this one, but not as good as the Cynster series. My mother-in-law concers."
2,The Lady Chosen,"Disappointing and boring. I have read all her other books and enjoyed them all very much, so my reaction to this book was unusual. There was no real feeling of chemistry between the 2 main characters and nothing to attract me to either of them. Very one-dimensional."
2,"Far, far too long","This book has the same problem that afflicts most of Stephanie Laurens' books -- it was about a hundred pages too long. The romance plot (Plot A, if you will) just couldn't sustain itself for that long, by that point becoming just absolutely ridiculous that the heroine wouldn't marry (I mean, they've had sex just about every way and everywhere with no thought to birth control -- why NOT marry?), and she didn't have what I feel were suitably compelling reasons to keep resisting (other writers like Eloisa James can write a good ""I love you but I can't marry you"" reason, Laurens just really can't).Then, the mystery plot (Plot B) completely died on the table. I had no interest in it, and it just didn't have anything close to the force needed to drive the back end of the story. The book was over on page 300, but it kept going and going for another 100. Don't buy this book -- get it out of the library, and be prepared to put it down early."
2,Too long for a mediocre story,"I picked up this book expecting another fabulous historical from Stephanie Laurens, rich in characters and an intriguing plot. But the book was too long to support this plot, and the characters, especially the heroine, wore thin. One of Laurens' strengths as a romance writer is how well she writes the hero's journey to win over the heroine. And in this novel, the heroine's protestations are extremely weak and outcome is obvious from the beginning.The Lady Chosen certainly cannot compare with any of the Cynster novels, which have distinct characters and compelling romances. I fear the Bastion Club series is going to be 7 novels of retread ground, especially if Laurens is writing 2 per year."
2,great concept awful awful book,"Who does not love the idea that a bunch of handsome, heroic ex-spies would form a club and just be manly. I know I believed these books would be great especially with all the good reviews. I forced myself through 5 of her books thinking they had to be good with those kind of reviews. Don't do it! All her books contain are love scene after love scene with bad writing, unbelievable and dull plots. I don't know why I thought this book was so bad, I was just so bored. I gave this book two stars only because I loved the idea of the Bar Cynster. For entertaining historical romance you actually enjoy reading try Julia Quinn, Judith McNaught, or Gaelen Foley and save yourself hours that feel wasted."
1,Don't waste your time!!,I read a lot of book and have never felt so compelled to write a review. This book is awful. The characters have no redeeming value. There is NOTHING likable about either of them. The plot is weak and there is no chemistry between the main characters. Don't waste your time on this one!
2,Alright,This is my first stephanie laurens book. Iwasn't that impressed. The story was okay somehow the events leading to the mystery were tame and when revealed was a dud... The romance was also normal. Read it if someone lends it to u or borrow from library.
4,Love SL's writing but didnt L O V E this book,"I am an avid reader of everything Stephanie Laurens writes, and was so hooked when I read ""The Promise in a Kiss"" that I went and bought all the books she had written thus far. The way her characters interact and get into interesting ""tangles"" always keeps me up until the early morning reading. I waited anxiously after reading the last of the cynster series for the start of this Bastion Club series, but after reading this first book I felt that I could have waited a while. It was a great read once it got started, but I put it down several times before I finally decided to just finish it. I'm still anxious to see what the rest of the series holds, but I can't say this is the BEST that Mrs. Laurens has."
2,Rather Boring for a Ms. Lauren's Novel....,"I used to think that Ms. Laurens was a brilliant romance novelist & used to buy all of her newly published books, but lately, all of her works R rather boring & uninspired, & unfortunately, this one's no exception either...."
4,Introducing the Bastion Club,"The war is over. Napoleon is exiled to St. Helena. And now the soldiers return to make their future and find a wife. But, there are many more young women than eligible men. To protect themselves from the determined mamas and doting papas looking to snag any presentable male into marriage, our war heros form the Bastion Club at Number 12 Montrose Place.This first book in the series starts with the establishment and installation of the club next door to Miss Leonora Carling's uncle, Sir Humphrey. And Miss Carling wants to know if the members of the new club are responsible for the disturbances at Number 14.The story is well told. Laurens does not try to introduce all 7 of her titled gentlemen in this first book; she gives us the overview and then concentrates on the Earl of Trentham, Tristan Wemyss, and his pursuit of Miss Carling."
4,The Lady Chosen,"This is one of the Bastion Club series, with lots of romance and always an undercurrent sub plot involving the lovers running thru the book and series,"
2,Something was missing,"Decent writing--in terms of grammar, style, and storytelling technique. Decent plot. But something seemed missing. I felt nothing for either of the main characters. And the plot was not interesting enough to keep my interest in the story in spite of the characters. I could barely find the motivation to finish it."
2,Not much better than the manual,"I was very dissapointed with this guide. I expected more hard numbers to play around with to help optimize ship design. There are some handy tables, but they totally neglected power usage numbers for weapons. You can get those numbers from the game by painstakingly replace each type of weapon and seeing how it affects warp power requirements. Why couldn't the guide give me these numbers? How about the formula (even a rough one) that relates max speed to impulse and total mass? How about more of an explantion for different cloak types vesus anti-cloakcomputers?I know they dumbed down SFC3 to reach a wider audience, but did they have to dumb down the strategy guide too?The manual does do a good job previewing the campaign missions though."
2,An oddly disappointing performance.,"One would think, offhand , that this symphony, with all it's spectacular orchestral effects, would be a natural for Ormandy. It doesn't work out that way. I believe that this is because a really effective performance requires more discipline on the part of the players, and especially the brass, than is generally realized. The players should concentrate on getting their entrances, exits and dynamics exactly right, and let the music do the emoting."
4,Solid SOCA,Another of the Soca Gold series. This one is better than some of the others I have sampled. Popular tracks from the late 90s.
4,Missing True Heart and Soul,"I thought this book was missing one key element -- the heart and soul of an original work that comes from someplace deep inside a writer -- the place where he Must write the book. These authors put this one together because they wanted one thing: to create a new best-seller. If you want to read a book that comes from that authentic place in a writer's soul, ""9 Free Secrets of New Sensual Power"" is a must. Your mate will thank you."
2,not very interesting & vaguely distasteful,"The author lost my interest fairly shortly into the program, as he started reciting the 24 (or however many) ""ah-ha's"" that one must remember in order to become wealthy. Even short lists of things to remember tend to be tedious if not creatively crafted and delivered, and I found this long list to be neither of those. Skipping ahead a bit, the suggested method of applying a numerical rating to your contacts (most of which are probably also your friends), and always regarding these people in accordance to how valuable they are to your bottom line, to be a bit distasteful. Then I skipped ahead to the part where everyone in a business environment could be neatly categorized into a woodland animal archetype, and I just had to stop listening. This may be a great book for some, but I got rid of my copy before finishing it, and have not regretted that move."
3,Commerical Real Estate Investment Advisor - Miami,"The book started off great but soon became redundant and boring. Each month I read a book that may give me some another point of view that I can discuss with my clients. This was not it! I was expecting more due to the reviews but it is just another motivation book with little insight to offer the average ""Joe"" and not even a savvy investor, a look into how to really make your first, second or third million. Sure there is a mind set that has to be encouraged but when do you really tell some how too start. This book was very disappointing to say the very least. I believe it get people motivated then leaves them to their own devices to run out of gas!!!! The mindset is right but other stuff is just fluff!"
2,Almost a complete waste,"I would give this book 1 star, but it does have the ""feel good"" factor. Other than that, its pure tripe. Read a real book on business philosophy such as ""Good to Great."" Look up Robert Allen online, almost all reviews of him point to the fact that he is a cheat. Don't buy any of his products."
1,Not much substance...,I was really suprised with the poor qualityof this book since I really enjoyed Robert Allen'sprevious books Mulitple Streams of Income and MulitpleStreams of Internet Income. This current edition ofcreating wealth was just a bunch of feel good psychologicalnonsense laced with some information in his previousbooks. I even noticed some information that was fromhis free reports which can be obtained at his website.Don't waste your money on this book. If you must read itcheck it out of the library.
1,Not very happy!,"I never received the product. I ordered the CD version, but it ended up being a book listing. They cancelled the order."
2,Another weak project from Robert Allen,"This time he teams with the author of the Chicken Soup books. Does this make anything he says any more relevant? This is basically a weak attempt at giving you the psycology of a millionare with ""ah-has"" and ""manifestions"" thrown in for good measure. He also uses cliff note ideas from some of his other works. A nuts and bolts way to a million dollars? Not hardly. And there are better books out there to get you thinking and acting in a successful way. Mr Allens books aren't all bad. They are mostly bathroom reading and obvious attempts to promote his other endeavors."
1,Garbage!,"These two ought to be ashamed of themselves. If they knew so much about making millions why aren't they busy as hell doing it instead of spending so much time telling others how to do it? Is it out of the goodness of their hearts? I think it has to do with the fact that they make millions off the people who want to make millions.The fiction part of this book is laughable. The heroine actually bets her inlaws that she can make 1 million dollars in 90 days. What's the the wager you ask? Oh, only custody of her children.Now there's a nice message.You gotta be kidding me guys..."
2,Some Meat But You Have To Search For It,My hat has to go off to these two guys as theyre very successful. Bu they could have written this on half the paper. Too much hype and too little substance. There is some good stuff in here but not sure its worth searching through to get to. The format of a novel and a how to book in the same book is interesting but it was far too predictable for me. Lets go for less hype and some straight forward advice rather than a new method for these two to make a million.
1,One Big Ad,The whole reason for this book to exist is so they can try to upsell you to tele-courses that cost THOUSANDS of dollars. It's actually disgraceful how they hawk one product and course after another. Run the other way !
1,Extremely Disappointing,"Sorry, but this book was terrible. I had bought it by mistake because its title was so similar to a book I was looking for (Bach's ""The Automatic Millionaire,"" a much more useful book). Seriously, their great ""ideas"" about how to make money are: buy real estate with Other People's Money! Invent something everyone wants and sell millions of it! Seriously??? Like I would need a book to tell me that?? If I could do either of those things I'd already be rich and wouldn't need the book. For most people, these ideas are unrealistic and unworkable.They have this very naive notion that all you have to do is hang around with some rich people, and they will be happy to teach you all their secrets and lend you money to fund your dreams. Yeah...sure.Completely useless book; waste of money."
5,The first book to truly inspire me!,"I have read many self-improvement / financial freedom books, but for some reason, this book appeared at the right time and the right place for me. Mark and Robert have broken new ground with the fiction/non-fiction concept, I am now equipped with the theory, but also a vivid visualisation of what I must and will do to become a millionaire. Go for it everyone out there, wealth can be yours!"
5,The millionaire ideas are just amazing!,"The success principles of most self-help books are relatively the same - persistence, focus, visualization, sacrifice, and hard work are just some of the common themes.But this book is different. These two authors actually espouse giving away money as an effective strategy to financial stability. Simply put, generosity is a surefire way to wealth.The more you give, the more you receive. When you give 10% of your profit or income to good causes, you become closer to the great and infinite source of wealth.No wonder, both authors are millionaires because they subscribe to a principle that no ordinary mortals would dare do.Even for this one principle alone, I highly recommend this book to all of you who want to be rich the right way."
4,The One Minute Millionaire,"A good approach to looking at life and an easy read. The dual fact/fiction format also works well. Many of the suggestions are very intuitive but there are several ""ahas"" in the book"
1,"Sadly the ""schemes"" in the book will not work",Brought the book because of the author - but reading it made me angry! Not one of the suggestions would work period. Flipping homes sure that works just not the way he says. Internet site no way does the money go directly into YOUR bank account and you don't just set up a web site and thousands of people are ordering from you (otherwise we would all be rich). Look at what amazon did to just get in the red lol. Save your money as this book will only enRICH the author.
4,Good lessons & powerful thoughts,"I loved this book! It was a bit cheesey in places, but if you can get past that, this book has some powerful lessons & shows you how to apply them in simple ways. This was one of the first books I read on this sort of subject & would recommend this book very highly to other people new to this subject."
4,One Minute Millionaire Book,"The One Minute Millionaire - The Enlightened Way To Wealth book was originally taken out from a public library. After reading a couple chapters, I realized that I had to actually own the book to underline and do the required exercises, it was simple to find, buy, and get it from Amazon. Book arrived quickly,in great condition. Very satisfied."
4,"An interesting read, thought provoking.","I read one minute millionaire, which was an interesting read, as I entitled my review. I read as I would have a novel, for entertainment purposes, and came out of it with new ways of thinking. Too often we allow our perceptions of life, of how business works, or how we can or can't, should or should not make money dictate to us how we live.I haven't exactly gotten rich from the book just yet, but it has given me a lot to think about.Paul Buckner,author of: ""From Broke To Broker: Stories of Finding Financial Freedom""and""Gabriel Jennings and The Ferret Freedom Fighters."""
1,A strangely formatted book with little substance,"The format of this book is just plain strange. The non-fiction hints and tips are on all the left pages and a fiction novel is on all the right pages. I would have prefered the book be divided into 2 normally formatted sections.The books content is surprisingly full of empty rhetoric. The fiction novel section just seemed to pander to the reader and insult my intelligence in too much of a 'touchy-feely' style, the non fiction section was quite lacking in real workable solutions. It mainly delved into psychological and religious pep talks, even quoting the bible on a few occaisions.I'm basing my rating on the fact that this book is a lowest common denominator type book in that it assumes a low level of intelligence for the readers."
3,OK but......,"I wanted cold hard facts,ideas and tips gained from experience. I got half the book. The other half may be pleasant reading for some but it was highly improbable and very preachy. It would be more worthwhile if the novellist in the authors would write up case stories in which the principles shown are put to use in clear ""non-fluffy bunny wabbit"" form. We aren't first graders.overall, this is worth a buy but only just."
5,An Excellent Book,"The unusual set up- half fiction, half non-fiction, makes this a must read for everyone. It contains great ideas for life, as well as business.I'm sure you will be inspired by what you read."
1,A waste of money,"The only people who is making a million with this book are the writers.The story is really hilarious, unreal and fiction.The book is a bundle of all Allen's books in a new glossy coat with a nice Chicken soup for the soul sauce.I made my money and this is not how it is going to happen to you, it never goes as in the books."
2,Boring,"This book is boring. Contrary to what some of the reviewers say, there is no substance. I mean, you be the judge and see if you can get anything from this: desire + belief + action = success. If you are looking for an inspirational read, this could work. But there are no specific ways on how to become rich. The substance portion comes in in the chapter on real estate since that is what Allen is known for but those techniques are old school. Why don't you try to buy property no-money down right now (2006). I don't think I'll read his books again."
2,"Poor Book Format and Lots of Bits and Bites, Scattered Knowledge on Pop Finance","Did not enjoy the book format of the book. Why? It tries to achieve too much. Combining Self-help Content on Pop Finance, and a Novel inside on Wealth Hunting.The point sizes of the words inside the book are terribly small (paperback!). I found the reading experience filled with ideas jumping around.Read "" Learn to Earn"" is much much better."
2,Don't waste your money,Their books seem to focus on making money in real estate. Why don't they come out and say so. How many people do you know that have boought a house with no moeny down? This book is not reality but it sure is making them rich.
1,ROBERT ALLEN is a used car salesman,Save your money. Look for a late night infomercial get rich quick scheme and invest it there instead.
1,Can everybody become a Millionaire? The Answer is Yes,"Some time people must realize the bad things in their life, and then they can choose become a victim or a victory. The book wrote the theory and the applicable sample of a mother, who under very high pressure defend her children, must accomplish bring one million dollar in 90 days!This is wealth creation book, psychology book, personality, and inspiring.You must read it, then you can change your life."
1,Write dumb books and get dumb people to buy them :),"What I say in the title says it all: THAT is how you canbecome a millionaire quickly, just as the authors of thisand similar books have done :) Luckily, I only looked atsome of these masterpieces at a bookstore for free..."
1,regurgitated crud.,"one of the most worthless books i ever bought. save your money for ""multiple streams of income"" instead."
1,Too Preachy and Religious!,"I rarely write reviews, but I found this book to be offensive! First of all, this book should have made it CLEAR that it was religious / God book, instead of a business book. I found the author's tone and info to be way too preachy and simple minded.There's a need and a market for religious books, but for those of us who are not religious, it's very misleading and offensive to misrepresent a book as a business / career book."
3,Six degrees of separation,"This book is better than the Wealthy Barber or any of the Kiyosaki books that are written in this type of ""make believe"" style.However I was left with two questions: Where do you get a mentor like the one in the book for free? Not to mention, friends like that? Friends that will work for free and support you unconditionally2.5 - 3 stars - It has some good points"
4,Helpful Guide,"I was given a copy of this book as a gift and found it really inspirational. To me, the greatest strength of the book is the motivational aspect - the authors do not only give money-making ideas and techniques but they also encourage positive thinking. To me that is the most important ingredient in the journey to being a millionaire. We just have to believe we can do it. The only thing about the book that threw me off a bit was the way it was structured with a fictional story on one side and the fact-based information on the other. Maybe it was just me but I would have preferred all the fact-based information first and then the story after. Overall, though, I would highly recommend it."
2,Its just ....ok,"The first ""Cruel Intentions"" was highly underrated. There was a strong chemistry within the cast (obviously since Reese & Ryan married!) and the characters weren't one dimensional. Even evil Kathryn was capable of pain that Sarah Michelle Gellar managed to convey in brief moments which was perfect for that character. But Cassidy for CI3 falls way short of being three dimensional. She's just cruel for the whole film and showed no weakness. Everyone has a weakness. However, I will say that the character Patrick somewhat intrigued me. He went beyond the game of cruelty and ...well, I won't give away what happens, but I was very disturbed by it. As for Kerr, he was alright. Its not his fault his character was kind of dull. Anyway, the film is ""ok"". Its worth watching if you run into it on cable, but I wouldn't buy the movie."
1,The worst intentions of all!!!,"First put, this movie has nothing to do with cruel intentions. It is a disgrace to its name and to be associated with it.The only relevance is the mentioning of the 2 main characters from the last 2 films relating to the main female character. That's it!!! What a shame!The first movie was the BEST!!! The second...well, it was a pretty decent prequel, thought production value was like a grade-B movie.This third has a better presentation than the second, but the storyline sucks so bad!!! The characters are very annoying, especially the 2 college guys. The ending is just a waste.STAY away from this 3rd installment!!!"
1,and the reason being...,"you would think that after the success of the 1st, and the demise of the 2nd that no one would want to slap their names and work on this movie....but...anything to get one noticed i guess...even if that does mean on youre resume it will say STARRED IN CRUEL INTENTIONS 3...if you see the person opposite of you start chuckling and place his hand over his mouth, maybe you will realize that sleeping with the director to be on this movie really wasnt the smartest career choice you could have made...i havent seen it, nor do i want to...theres nothing anyone could to do improve on Rodger Kumble's, sarah michelle gellar, ryan phillippe and reese witherspoons amazing accomplishment...so why try...you're only going to fail and put your name to shame...not to mention totaly screw up any and all chances you have of being in another movie...tv show..commerical...ect..."
1,Total crap!,"What were they thinking?I mean come now! The second one was bad enough, Sebastion(the main star) is dead! KAtherine is probably in rehab, and Anette is somwhere in paradise! Now how could they make Another sequel? The only think that would be remotley inturesting would to make the movie about Cecile(Selma Blair), but no it is about Sebastion's and Katherine's cousins now that is what I call straight to video high quality crap!!"
2,Looks good...Worked good for about 4 months,"I may have used this case considerably in the 4 months I had it, but the clasps that close and lock the briefcase both broke. One after about 4 months of ussage and the second clasp broke only a month later. Now it won't shut so it's pretty much rendered useless. The reason I wrote this review is because I'm currently shopping online for another briefcase. Hopefully one that will last a couple of years at least. I would say the first clasp might have been defective at first, but both broke so I would say it's more like a product defect."
1,Disappointment,"This was a waste of my money. I am deeply disappointed that Wenger put their logo on this product. A simple bump of the case on any hard object/surface severely damages its ""leather"". The case emits a very bad odor when left in direct sunlight, the latches fail to open quite often, and its overall quality is very disappointing. I recommend that this product be pulled off the shelves/stores. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY BUYING THIS PRODUCT."
3,"WYSIWYG -- Sizing info unclear, explained below","The sizing is unclear on these socks so if you're wondering...the ""L"" size is ladies, 9 - 11 and the XL size is for men, 10 - 13.I wish the company had included sock/shoe size info in their ""sizing info"" link but they did not and I wound up wit the wrong size socks, which would've actually cost more money to return so I am stuck with them, d'oh!Oh well. Hopefully you won't need to make the same mistake.Cute socks, though. Decent quality. No complaints, there."
2,Don't waste your time or money,"I've heard for a long time about how great this book was. Unless you have never been in an Asian market, you really don't need this thing. There is a MUCH better book called the Asian Grocery Store Demystrified or something like that. So much a better book with much better explainations. I guess if you live in Lawrenceville KS or somewhere in the midwest this would be ok, If you think chop-suey is exotic, this would be your tome."
4,BEAUTIFUL TRACK! INCREDIBLE LYRICS!!,"I saw this single in a store here in New York City and had to buy it. Never heard it before. It's just that I have every Chicane single released since ""Offshore"" back in 1997. ""No Ordinary Morning"" is such beautiful track and the lyrics really tug at your heart strings. Tracy Ackerman's amazing voice you might remember from tracks such as ""Solace"" by SOLAR STONE but, she's probably best known featured on the gorgeous 1999 track ""Everytime"" by LUSTRAL. The only slight dissapointment with this single is that there are NO REMIXES for this song. Maybe there will be soon. Cuts 2 and 3 on this single are simply remixes of Chicane's recent track Halcyon. They're ok but, I really would like to hear a club remix of ""No Ordinary Morning"". So, buy this single. It's a beautiful song with INCREDIBLE lyrics and I'm going to go and hunt down some remixes. Bye, for now."
5,The Passmores,"Thoroughly researched and documented, this book does an outstanding job of comparing previously written information (specifically Passmore manuscripts). The source notations are outstanding which makes it very easy to confirm information back to the original source. Wills, deeds, probate records and other sources are included completely. For anyone related to William Passmore, this book is a must. Although expensive, the volume of original source information well pays for itself. The years of research taken to compile this book is very evident."
3,Thinly Disguised Dishing of Dirt.,"While agreeing with the other reviewer that the author does not have great writing skills, this book is an easy read (aimed at your average musclehead?)and a good page turner as anyone with even the most basic knowledge of the history of bodybuilding/physical culture can spot the thinly disguised real characters in this book. For anyone who doesn't know about much of the subject matter in this book it will be a real eye-opener.The centre page photos of the author with various celebrities are a major detraction from this book being taken seriously as a novel.You could easily read this book in half a day so its ideal for squeezing into the space between all those long hours in the gym. Alternatively, save it for a wet public holiday when the gym is closed."
2,Major Letdown,"I've seen 12 year old's with better writing skills.I agree with the reader from Boston,Mr. Minichiello pretty much wrote Arnold's story and changed the names and put a sexual twist on it.(...)"
1,Pure Trash,"Although this book is supposed to be nonfiction, I could plainly see one very well-known bodybuilder all over the place within it. I was hoping this would be an entertaining, informative book about the truth behind the scenes of bodybuilding. Instead, it reads more like a homosexual romance novel. The book was self-published, and as is consequently the case with most self-published books, lacking is grammatical and spelling corrections."
5,Heir Apparent,"This thriller blew me away. John Altman is the heir apparent to Higgins, Le Carre, and the other masters of the genre. I hope there's a sequel soon by this extremely talented new writer!"
4,Goofy of tons of fun,The plot totally doesn't bear scrutiny but Katrina is a terrific character. Hopefully the author will bring her back -- on our side this time.
5,Great read.,"I read this great spy book in two sessions. Very, very captivating read. One comment I have is that Mr. Altman used a very uncommon word on page 91. ''past a 'susurous' pond''. This word stopped me in my tracks so that I could look up the word. This elitist use of an uncommon word spoiled a good read for me."
4,John Altman creates a great spy novel,"OK, we know there are a few implausibilities. How does Winterbotham get to be such a good spy? Why do they recruit a guy with questionable sympathies in the first place? How does Katarina survive all those injuries and keep killing so many people? (Paging Linda Hamilton!) But who cares? This is a great spy novel, with plenty at stake (just the fate of the world, no big deal!), and characters on both sides to root for. Yes, you WILL find yourself at times rooting for Katarina. Eveyrone has their agendas, and Altman makes it fun keeping track of them all, seeing how the agendas weave together."
1,Poor at best,"This is the first review I've felt compelled to write. This book is awful. The only interesting aspects read suspiciously like "" An Unlikely Spy"". The editorial reviews are bogus. Don't waste your time or money."
2,"Not Bad, but not Good either!","I know that is a harsh title, but this is not one of my favorite books. I feel the plot was very predictable and I had a hard time working my way through it. The last hundred pages started to get interesting, however, it ended much to suddenly. You build and build and build, then end it that suddenly. I would have liked it to continue for another 100 pages, a lot more could and should of been said. I will, however, read his next novel."
2,A Fast Read But Lacks Credibility,"John Altman's debut novel, A Gathering Of Spies, is a WWII spy thriller that provides a fast read and lots of action. Unfortunately, I can't give this book more than just a ""fair"" rating (i.e. 2 stars) for two reasons. One reason is that Altman's characters lack sufficient depth for me to care about any of them. The second reason is that while the plot takes many twists and turns, many of them lack credibility and are too predictable. I think Altman has the potential to be a future bestselling author and a writer of well-written books. However,unlike some other reviewers, in my opinion, this particular work does not deserve for Altman to be compared to some of today's better spy thriller authors. Maybe he'll be deserving of this comparison in the future, but not now."
1,Stole the plot from Le Carre,"Are you kidding me with this book? In the course of the first few chapters I caught on immediately. The plot and construct of the main character are largely stolen from John LeCarre's ""The Spy who came in from the Cold.""Same deal: an aging protagonist, inserted into an espionage plot so deeply under cover, with loyalites to his country and the woman he loves so conflicted that we, the readers, are left to wonder which way he will turn.Here's what's very telling. Altman gets glowing reviews on the book jacket form other spy writers. But if you read his bio, Altman's only credentials are that he comes from a family of writers.Thhe bio also promises that Altman is busy on his second book. I can hardly wait."
1,Borrrrrring !!,"This book just arrived in our local library & I am the first person to read it. How such authors as Stephen Coonts, Jack Higgins & Ronald Kessler could give this author a rave review is beyond me. It must be a requirement of the publihing world that there has to be an 'Old Boy Network' in writing as well as everything else. Altman is a musician, perhaps he should write about that since he knows next to nothing about spy novels! I know I am being harsh; maybe his next book will be better but ""A Gathering of Spies"" as a first effort is pretty poor."
2,I've seen this idea handled MUCH better,"This appears to be an attempt to take off on Daniel Silva's ""An Unlikely Spy"", which was a REAL thriller. Many of Altman's repeated phrases ( e.g., ""between the fourth and fifth ribs"" ) quickly became boring. I suspect that anyone who thinks this is ""a exciting first novel"" ( &c. ) hasn't read Silva's book."
5,Loved The Book!,"This was one of several books I got at Christmas, and it did not disappoint. As a fan of the genre, I think Altman is a welcome new addition. This spy book is definitely NOT the same old, same old. I couldn't put it down once I started it. Bravo!"
5,style and intrigue,"I bought this book on a friend's recommendation and wasn't disappointed. It's full of intrigue, an old fashioned page turner! The antogonist, Katrina, is like a latter day Charlie's Angel, butworking for the bad guys. It would make a great movie."
4,"Wonderfully told, zero real tradecraft, worth a read","As a former spy myself--long since out from under cover with permission--this book jumped off the supermarket shelf at me, the title and the recommendations from Jack Higgins overcoming my general reluctance to read fiction.The book is a five for a light tale told very smoothly, and a three for lacking any real knowledge of tradecraft and spying--hence a four average. It is nowhere near an ""Enigma"" or ""The Unlikely Spy"" or ""The Black Tulip"", my three favorites in this past decade, but for a first novel by someone with no field experience it is quite worthy and I will look forward to the next effort by this author.This is an honest solid book, worth the price and the time."
2,Fair ar best,"This novel is a dubious debut. Questionable at best. Look, I realise it's a first novel, but please...Skip this one and read The Unlikely Spy. Now there's a spy thriller! And you can bet the farm that Mr. Altman himself has read it--repeatedly. I mean even his Nazi female spy and Mr. Silva's (The Unlikely Spy) share the same first name: Catherine. Couldn't think of another name? Hey, wasn't Silva's Chatherine's father being held at a concentration camp as leverage as well? Hum? The dust jacket says Mr. Altman comes from a long line of writers. Obviously, one of them pulled some strings for him."
1,Laughable.,"This book gives a new meaning to the term ""page turner"" -- I couldn't wait to finish it (mainly because I have an obsessive/compulsive habit of finishing any book I start, even if I have to skim the remaining 90%)! The plot is good, but the writing is sophomoric, and the characters are cartoonish. It reads like a proposed film script. Bubble and Squeak indeed! The book would have benefited from an historical epilogue detailing what eventually happened to Canaris, as well as to the real German spies that were turned by the Brits, such as Garbo. I don't think Le Carre, Micheal Frayn, Charles McCarry, or even Ken Follett or Daniel Silva have much to fear from Mr. Altman."
3,Fun but could have been so much better,"The few negative reviews on this book are actually right on the koney. The plot is a joke. But Katrina makes the read so entertaining -- especially if you were disappointed by the lousy ""Unlikely Spy"" in which a very similar character also named Catherine gets treated pretty horribly in the end.Enjoy!"
1,A GATHERING OF SPIES doesn't cut it,"Do not open this book unless you are terminally desperate for reading material. Aside from the many factual errors -- likely the result of skimpy research by the author and/or the lack of the publisher's fact-checking -- this title is basically a pot-boiler featuring stereotypical, one-dimensional Nazi bad guys, rather improbable plotting, and a good deal of just plain silly dialogue. While the author seems to have tried his best, one hopes his second novel, now in the works (according to the dust jacket) will prove to be a more mature labor."
2,Slow Reading -- Boring,"The plot and characters were thinly developed; the scenarios were historically inaccurate; and the writing was laborious. I struggeled to get through this one -- hoping that something would happen to make the plot more interesting. Alas, the story ends abruptly and oddly. The only ""suspense"" (more hoping the book would end) that I saw was a needlessly drawn out third section.I consistently read books of this genre. This is one that I would definately not purchase again."
4,"Nice and sweet, not a lemonade taste however","This is one of our top flavors of Torani. I expected a sharper lemon, like you'd use for lemonade, but the Torani lemon is much sweeter. This is more of a lemon cake or lemon candy level of taste instead of a bitter lemon or fresh lemon. It makes a tasty drink with seltzer or a nice italian ice flavoring, but I find we most often cut it with theTORANI LIME 750 MLflavor."
3,Not Well Thought Out,"This is a good documentary for seeing the real people, and hearing the real timeline, but it is a dull, plodding documentary. The overly dramatic (and sometimes overly loud) score, the childish animation (a blazing football) and the inability to make you care from the beginning mar this story.Told in bits and pieces interspersed with footage from later seasons, interviews with families that lost parents (but none with families that lost players), no background as to why Lengyl felt the need to help out...honestly, it was boring.I mean no disrespect to anyone involved with Marshall - this just wasn't the documentary to honor any of them."
5,Life (does) matter,I read this book with my wife each taking assignments and reporting back after a day or two. What an incredible read and experience. There is a wealth of challanging material in this book to help anyone wishing to expand themselves into a more thoughtful person.A pure blessing that has potential and material to make a substancial upswing in one's life.Rocco
3,Not really for self help,It's a useful book to understand the theory behind the treatment but doesn't really provide techniques for home use.
2,? on Question Mark,"I agree with the reviewer from Florida: Amazon should give as vital information if the CD contains original material or later issues, eventually ""live""-recordings. As I'm looking for original items this Live-CD wasn't very helpful to me! Hence the 2 stars."
1,Thank you!,"To everyone who suggested I not purchase this after all of your terrible experiences. I was in line at PetSmart with this is my hand. I decided to do a quick check of reviews here on Amazon before I reached the register. I expected to read maybe something about poor effectiveness, not THIS! Thank you for sparing my 5 cats, several of them elderly, this pain!"
1,Kitty started foaming at the mouth a day after application,"My cat got very sick from this product. She started ""foaming at the mouth"" I washed it off of her immediately. This happened today and I'm hoping she feels better now that I removed it."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,This product poisoned my cat. I applied it to the back of his neck and followed all of the directions. He immediately went in to seizures and had to be taken to the emergency animal hospital where he was treated over night. DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!!!
2,Something wrong,"This is a 2 CD set containing a total of 27 songs composed by Armando Manzanero and supposedly sung by Armando Manzanero and his guests as duets. However, the songs are too much overdubbed and some sound like somebody (else) making a solo. Worsestill, the packaging is most disappointing, like a counterfeit product --- there's no booklet, no lyrics, not a single sheet of liner notes, not any recording or production dates... which is quite unusual for a regular multi-CD set from Warner Music."
5,Pilates Essentials,"Pilates Essentials is perfect for anyone interested in, or just beginning to use the pilates program. The instructions are clear and well illustrated; moreover, the pace is such that a beginner can easily follow the program without difficulty. It's ideal for anyone looking for an easy to follow, low impact fitness program."
1,"Great setting, poor author","The book had an intriguing premise -- behind-the-scenes chicanery at two large NYC museums -- but the author's writing does not do it justice. The lead character was bland, the red herrings not even heart-felt, the loose ends plentiful, the dialogue weak, and the characters poorly drawn. In page after page of unattributed dialog -- where were the editors? -- no clear sense of character emerged that would have me, as reader, link lines to a particular character. The museum setting is a rich opportunity for a better writer. Of three people reading this book, two of us would not return to this author."
3,"Good, but a confusing ending","I like Linda Fairstein's novels, they are well written, and I enjoy the repartee of the man characters Alexandra Cooper, Mike Chapman and MercerWallace.This case involved a body found in a sarcophagus that was being shipped to Egypt as part of a museum exchange. How did the body of an obviously 21st century woman get into this mummy case, and where is the mummy of the princess who is supposed to be there?I really enjoyed reading all the background information on museums and all that goes into putting on an exhibition. I found the mystery itself to be a little confusing towards the end, and didn't really get some of the things that happened, but for the most part I enjoyed the book. It was a little longer than needed, and the 2 parallel story lines could have been eliminated, but overall a fairly good read."
4,"Really enjoyed, but had it's ups and downs","I truly enjoyed this book and it was a page turner for me.There were points where I got lost with all the characters, leads, museums and vaults, but frankly, I finished it in a few days as I had a hard time putting it down. Kept me interested until the end."
2,I Really Wanted To Like This Book!,"Beacause I have read her previous books,I know Ms. Fairstein is certainly capable of producing an interesting story, but this is not example of her best effort. I tried to get involved with the plot of this book, but it just couldn't keep me interested...I finally just put it in the bag of books that I donate to my public library. Hopefully, someone else will find it worth finishing."
2,who's talking?,"Not impressed. Ending kind of anti-climactic. Dialogue cumbersome, but the most frustrating was half the time I couldn't tell who was speaking. Paragraph after paragraph of exchanges, with no indication of who is speaking. Not ultimately important in the plot, but distracting and frustrating. Poor writer."
3,Disappointed Reader,I was at first pleased with the book but when it drifted into a political statement on the rights of minorities even to the point of a white woman from South Africa being raped by a blackman not seeking to pursue justice as couldn't bring herself to accuse a blackman because of the injustices done to blacks in her native county in the past it lost my interest.
2,Good but not a real mystery,"Lots of interesting details about what goes on behind the scenes at the Metropolitan & the Natural History Museum, but a really weak mystery plotline. _NO_ knowledge of Africa at all, just New York PC views. They're two different things. Willem van der Post's death is pure Hollywood -- anyone with any knowledge of Africa would just burst out laughing. The author also knows nothing about Continental names. 'Van der' is Dutch & any name which contains it is perfectly ordinary. 'Von' is Austrian & is always part of an aristocratic name. Also note that 'van der Post' would be listed under 'P', _not_ 'v'. I mention this because it's a significant point in the plot at the end. But this is a book written by an American for fellow-Americans."
5,Wow,"I love Fairstein's books and I literally couldn't put this latest one down. She has a knack for taking great New York institutions and landmarks and revealing the history and mystery behind them in an inventive way. The research is meticulous, the plot zings along, and, as always, Alex Cooper and her cohorts are great company. The Museum of Natural History is Fairstein's prime target this time, but there are fascinating tidbits about The Metropolitan Museum and the Cloisters. Reading about the hidden rooms, the storage spaces with extraordinary collections, not to mention what once went on in these places under the guise of scholarship, I just thought: Wow."
2,Did I read the same book?,"I lasted only one-third the way through this boring book. It has pages and pages of irrelevant dull dialog and detailed descriptions of what clothes the women wear. The part I read contained no sex, no violence, and no graphic murder. The plot is so farfetched and improbable that it is totally incredible. I loved Prey, The Last Jihad, and Dead Aim, but The Bone Vault is a book I could and did put down."
2,Hoped for better,"This could have been great but author resorted to padding using stuff that wasn't in any way relevant: 9/11, Martha's Vinyard, etc. I'll be honest. I'm halfway through and thinking of quitting."
2,Dull & Boring !,"I've read all of Ms. Fairstein's novels, and this is the most disappointing. The details of museum history as well as the travels through each and every room, vault, et al, failed to pique my interest. The best part is the interfacing among Alex, Mike and Mercer, however, this failed to raise this novel to a level where I would recommend. Ms. Fairstein has done much better in the past, but this exploration of the museum and bones as well as the convoluted plot which brought this novel to fruition was just not believable to me.Better luck next time, Linda!"
1,The Boring Vault,"I can only think the ""Bone Vault"" ploy and the museum location were contrived to build on the success of ""Relic"". The bone vault plays almost no role in the novel. The characters are so underdeveloped I had to reread references to the killer at the beginning of the story to refresh my memory. The killer had no personality in my mind. This book is a chore to read. There were times the main characters were having conversations about such nothingness I was conviced there was a page total the publisher insisted Fairstein reach. With novelists like M. Connelly and others out there don't waste your valuable reading time."
5,Another top-notch suspense novel,"I enjoy all of the books in this thoughtful, intelligent series. I enjoy Fairstein's high level of detail...clearly she knows her stuff. Highly recommended if you like fast-paced, entertaining mysteries.If you like this book, check out a new author I've recently discovered. I highly recommend Thirst by Dania Deschamps."
4,Good buy,"This double boiler is a good buy for the money...but a little lighter weight than anticipated. The lid is glass but somewhat thin. The boilers are fine and performed well with my cream pie recipes. The only disappointment at all was the weight of the pans and lid. I was expecting a heavier type pan. But in comparison to the other prices I reviewed, I would say this is perfect for my needs."
2,double boiler,The pans were lighter weight than I expected. The first time I used it the bottom pan had marks just from the water boiling. Expected better quality.
2,look beyond this one,"used it one time and it rusted on the inside. Constructed of thin material, may pose a sticking problem. I'd look elsewhere"
5,Great buy!,Product was ordered as a gift for my uncle. He loved it! It was very affordable. (I loved that!)
2,Big Dog Breeds,"I would not recommend this book to anyone who is thinking about buying a giant breed dog. This book does not tell the cons of owing a dog of this size and stature. I never saw the word ""drool"" mentioned nor the potential weights of any of these dogs. Also, in my opinion, the author is very biased when it comes to dog food manufacturers. He states that many owners think they know more about nutrition than the dog food producers. In many cases, owners do know more. He doesn't say much about the positive affects of a raw diet and supplements for giant breed and how most commercial dog foods are not geered to the growth of a giant breed. He really doesn't get into the genetic disorders that plague most giant breeds but gives a group of common disorders that affect all breeds. I was very disappointed with this book."
4,Good basic info.,"I found this book to be the right mix of simplicity, completeness and fun. The first half of the book is filled with good info (and reminders) that apply to any dog of any size. Since the book is easy to read, even going back over information that you have known for years is worth the effort to pick up those extra 1 or 2 gems (or reminders). If you're new to raising dogs, especially large ones, the info is kept straightforward and easy to understand.The second half of the book focuses in on the individual big breeds to help you make the right decision about which breeds might be right for you and what you need to take in to consideration in your selection. The descriptions are succinct and the pictures will make the process very enjoyable even for breeds that fall outside of your particular criteria."
4,Book,"""1001 Books To Read Before You Die""Plenty of information on good books out there.Very pleased with Amazons service and prices."
1,On our (un)representative selection,"The weighting towards books published in the last 50 years is just ridiculous - around half of the 1001 books. Sure, you can't please everyone, but this book does a disservice to all the books that have lasted more than 50 years that go unrepresented. Jane Austen may not be over-represented, for example, but John Wyndham certainly is. What about Xavier Herbert? Samuel Delaney? More from P G Wodehouse? This selection truly is only half-right."
2,"""Goodward?""","Some errors or omissions can always be conveniently ignored or blown-off without a second thought. Unfortunately for 1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die the mistake contained in its pages is too egregious to go unmentioned, and having not read the entire book, casts a cloud over every profile discussed therein.In 1001BYMYD's write-up for what is perhaps the greatest novel of the 19th Century, James' Portrait of a Lady, it inexplicably misspells or perhaps the author of 1001BYMD is stunningly unaware of the actual name of a seminal character in the history of literature: Caspar Goodwood is referred to as Goodward!One marvels at how an error of this magnitude could slip by the author, proof-reader, editor and publisher."
4,Anti-American Bias,"I looked through this book carefully and noted that many of the books listed were by authors born outside the United States. I would point out that the reviewers are all non-Americans, coming from mostly academic backgrounds. They left out several good authors like Jane Smiley, Anne Tyler, Norman Mailer, Thomas Wolfe, Bernard Malamud and many others. the best Stephen King novel is The Stand, not The Shining.Haven't any of the reviewers read non fiction books? There are many great non-fiction titles that were completely forgotten and well worth reading. This is all so subjective and therefore meaningless in the long run. Every one that reads books regularly has their favorite subject matter and author.This is a beautifully illustrated book which rates 4 out of 5 stars, worth looking through with a large grain of salt."
4,1001 Books,This item arrived quickly and in good shape. It is a birthday gift and has not yet been opened.Thank you.
4,Great book--but Homer's The Odyssey Is Glaringly Missing!!,"An incredible book about great books with many interesting photos, but I docked one star for NOT including the Greek epic poem by Homer, The Odyssey. Homer's epic is the foundation of Western literature, so how could the authors not include it? Ironically, references to Homer and The Odyssey are contained here (e.g. in the entry on James Joyce's Ulysses, and in other places)."
5,The ultimate book list collector's book,"I collect this genre of books. This is the ultimate collector's volume. The listings are broad-ranging, the descriptions are succinct and to the point, and the list covers the ancient to the contemporary. It is the best compendium of fiction writing in my collection."
4,puzzled,"Does anybody know what ""life span"" entries mean? They are at the beginning of each entry along with info like the book's original title and publication date. One of the early life span entries was over 100 years so doubt it's the author's life span, but I have found no explanation for it elsewhere in the book."
3,1001 Books - WHERE was Ayn Rand?,"Did anyone else notice that Atlas Shrugged, The Fountainhead, and Anthem were all missing? Although I know they had to keep the number under 1001, these absences seem to discredit, to a certain extent, the authors of 1001 books. One of the other reviewers made a good point. Why was Gogol's The Nose included and Atlas Shrugged not? The Nose is indeed an excellent short story, but Atlas Shrugged is one of the best novels to be written.Im very aware of the subjectivity of my own review, but my overall point is that - the authors of 1001 do not do a good job of qualifying their choices. I dont have a problem with the omission of great novels, but as a huge Ayn Rand fan, I would have liked to know why they chose the novels they chose. The name of the book is too definitive-sounding to leave readers wondering, ""WHY!"" after having read it. Sorry that was a bit rambly."
2,"Great books, Poor Descriptions!","I think that the authors for this book should be fired! This book contains 1001 great books, but they all have poor descriptions! They do a really bad job persuading people to read these books. I think I could do a better job writing the descriptions. Those are just my opinions on reading descriptions of the books I have read that were listed there."
1,1001 Random Books,"A disappointment. Out of 1001 books, I found 12 books that I haven't read that I would like to read. It looks like the authors ran out of gas early so they loaded up the book with filler. I can't believe that I need to read 6 books by Jane Austen since they are all very similar. Nor do I need to read 8 books by J.G. Ballard, 7 by John Banville, 10 by Samuel Beckett or 7 by Saul Bellow. And I am just up to the letter `B'. There is even a james Bond novel in there. I think you get the idea. Save your money. There are better links on Amazon's ""Here are some others you might like""."
4,1001 BOOK YOU MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER READING,"Interesting selection for anyone who likes to read reviews in order to find good reading. Too many titles by some authors, many significant ones missing. But, to each his own. WIll use it to find good titles which I may have missed over the years."
2,Leans Far Too Heavily Towards Modernity,My title says it all. At least half the list is from the 1900s. There are only 13 pre-1700s novels on the list. And 120 Days of Sodom is on the list? What the hell? Disappointing compared to the 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die.
2,Not what I wanted,"I purchased this book for a basket that was being made up for our church auction with a ""Nuts"" theme. I could not tell by looking at it what it contained, but upon receipt, I discovered several of the stories, etc., were too risque for the purpose intended."
2,"2.5 Stars: Shallow characters, predictable plot","The cartoonish characters make this an unsatisfying read. The book has some interesting elements (including the villain's unusual neck) and the author generates some moderately exciting action, but this book pales in comparison to Patrick O'Brien's Maturin/Aubrey series.Better to reread the O'Brien books a third or fourth time, than to read this once."
3,Poor conversion to digital format,Lots of errors in the text diminish the pleasure of reading this eBook. The quality control needs to be improved to insure an accurate text.
3,"Loved the book, hated the kindle version","I probably enjoyed this book more than any of the (chronologically) prior Sharpe stories I've read - good story, exciting, fun to see Sharpe commanding, lots of action well described. But, boy am I sorry I got the kindle version. It looks like it was badly scanned and quickly OCR'ed: Typos, wrong words, words strung together without spaces, sentences without punctuation, etc., etc., and on almost every single page. You would think that Amazon could hire some college kids (maybe even high school students!) for minimum wage to read the books and correct the typos - it's truly embarrassing that something so poorly edited could be distributed."
4,Great adventure story.,"The Sharpe series does for the British Army of the Napoleonic era what the Horatio Hornblower novels did for the Royal Navy. These books provide first rate adventure storytelling against a realistic backdrop depicting the world of the Napoleonic Wars. While some the of the plot twists for the immediate characters may seem fanciful (Mr Sharpe seems virtually invulnerable), the background material is factual and well researched. One gets a feeling for what life for the common soldier was like."
2,Ormandy & Tchaikovsky's Fifth,I couldn't agree more with David Hurwitz's review.Go with the Sony Essentials '59 recording. Ignore a bit of '50s tape hiss and enjoy the performance for under eight bucks!
2,Disappointing,"The authors make many good points about the need to haveconversations with your family about money and investing.However, the book includes far too many personal stories of random people and in particular of the Schwab family.The information is not particularly interesting or pertinent."
1,Where is the new music?,"If you own their other CD's you own all this music. Don't you get tired of being ripped off with CD's with no new songs? Let them produce new songs before offering the public a ""NEW CD""."
1,What a waste of a cd,"If you buy this cd, you like to throw away your cash. Anyone who is a fan already, has all of these songs and they sounded ten times better in a studio than they do onstage. If you haven't been a Chicks fan before, this one certainly won't convert you. Save the cash for their next album. Maybe it will be worth buying. This one is a stinker."
