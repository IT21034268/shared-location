4,Meat The Smiths.,"I can't really say this is better or worse than any other ""Smiths"" album, because I find them all to be very good. So, I guess this would be your typical ""Smiths"" disc, with many excellent songs, and some not-quite-so excellent songs. Their most well known track ""How Soon Is Now?"" is on here, but I don't see that as a huge plus since I feel it's been overplayed through the years. ""Headmaster Ritual"" is a great track, and a good start to the album. ""Barbarism Begins At Home"" has some catchy bass, and I think ""That Joke Isn't Funny Anymore"" is probably the best song included here. Overall, I suppose I'd actually suggest ""Louder Than Bombs"", ""The Queen Is Dead"", or even ""Strangeways, Here We Come"" before ""Meat Is Murder"", but it's still a very good album, and goes great with a juicy burger."
5,My unforgettable first experience with the Smiths!,"I bought this lp in 1986 (yes, I have the CD today). I heard an ad on KROQ for an upcoming LA concert - music sounded great in the short radio blip, so I went out to buy my first Smiths album. Little did I know what I was getting myself into.... Sixty seconds into ""The Headmaster Ritual,"" I was hooked, and soon became a most devoted fan. What a fantastic, brilliant song ""The Headmaster Ritual"" is! An excellent album all the way through, though not #1 on a ranking of Smiths albums. One never forgets their first Smiths experience, so this one will always have a special place in my collection."
3,"Get Louder Than Bombs, Queen is Dead, Strangeways","My sister, a big Smiths/Morrissey fan who introduced me to the music in the 80s, doesn't think this album is even worth 3 stars.How Soon Is Now is the best track, and for the original UK and European versions of the album without it this record gets two stars at best. The songs are just generally banal in comparison with Louder Than Bombs, The Queen is Dead, and Strangeways Here We Come."
5,The Smiths Album You Need To Own,"i got turned on to these guys when i was living in baton rouge, louisiana, by a black woman who was really into alternative music. then i got my best bud to make me a tape of this album and strangeways, here we come. both are excellent records. this one i really like alot because you really see morrissey's sense of sarcasm and humor coming into bloom.i have never skipped a track since i've started listening to it. best songs are: "" the headmaster's ritual,"" "" i want the one i cant have,"" meat is murder "" which is noteworthy because it takes on the subject of animal cruelty, and ""how soon is now,"" which is the ultimate whipped puppy's anthem. such a shame morrissey and marr didn't get along. but the output they created was enough"
5,Overrated or Underrated?,"Seems like everyone thinks this is either their best or worst album. I think it's neither, but every song is different and brilliant on it's own. Most of the songs have are pretty laid back, and it feels quite apparent that there was a lot more time spent writing them. I'd also like to say that the title track ""Meat is Murder"" is amazing. A beautiful six minute epic that I wish was longer."
5,Life changing,"This is a classic, essential recording, not only for any Smiths or Morrissey fan, but I feel for popular music fans in general. If you've never heard this, you're in for a real treat."
3,incomplete,"This well-produced album would have been perfect had they not left out ""How Soon Is Now."""
2,Repetitive....British Angst...and 1 of my fav. songs!!!,"I love ""How Soon is Now?"" The rest of the album is just ok. Not my type of music. Buyer beware!"
2,Disappointment,I love the Smiths and have all of their albums but this CD is their worst!! Sounds like a poor or rushed effort. All clickers save for How Soon Is Now. I don't get all of the praises I'm reading.
2,Nice looking but didn't work or last well,Great looking and seemed to be of high quality but out of the box there were problems that got worse over time: kettle leaked when the water boiled; it didn't whistle all of the time; due to the spherical design there is not a lot of flat surface for the bottom and on our gas stove it was often unstable until you adjusted it to sit 'just so'; the stainless stained and we could not get the stains out of the brushed surface; then lid started to fall apart after some time. In the end we asked to return it. I gave it two stars since the cost to quality/endurance ratio just was not very good in my opinion.
1,NOT Ready For Induction!!,"Nice enough tea kettle, however it does not work on induction burners (as advertised). That's the reason I purchased it....and returned it!"
4,Whats the words?,"I really liked the CD but their are no lyrics with the CD so I have to memorize the words. I like most the songs on it. It has some songs that are touching to the heart word rise, and some that are touching to the heart song wise. Inconclusion I give this CD a 4 because their wasn't no lyrics with it."
2,encouragement,"I listen to Disc 2 every single day. I have others, but certain songs on this CD really touches me. As I strive to walk closer with the Lord, some obstacle always seems to find its way into my pathway. But when I listen to ""Closer"" and ""Nothing Else Matters"" my mind is clear of all that is going wrong that day or in my life. Why? Because I know that there is a God up above that seats high and looks low and will not let any hurt, harm, or danger come upon His children that love Him and want to do right by His will. It's trully my inspiration."
3,WOW 2K1,"I would have to concur with the first comments -- disc #1 has some good stuff on it...a couple from 1999? Disc #2 is more traditional and an obvious effort to cater to different music tastes. That's OK, but in year's past, the WOW Gospel CDs mixed it up a lot more smoothly. So, its great if you know someone who likes whichever side you don't -- just buy a separate case and split it. This one has nothing on 1998 through 2000. They were so good, there have been several efforts to duplicate that type of mix. This year's set starts off great like years past and ends on a low note. I hope they do better next year..."
5,A+,I love this collection I but everyone of them that comes out it keeps me up to date on the latest gospel music and keeps me jam on my way to school
4,definetly worth a 4.5,i have this game for Ds and i just want to be the first to review this and it is fun but if you like racing and speeding without getting a ticket you can even hit a police car without getting in trouble this is so FUNNNNN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,I love this DVD,This is such an awsome movie. I suggest that everyone should watch this movie. Tobb Maguire did a great job as Spider-man. They also followed the comic scribt very closely. It was a joy for the whole family.
3,"Good movie, awful DVD","The movie was excellent, but that's not really the point. Not only is this DVD encoded with RCE (Regional Coding Enhancement, which means it *WON'T* run on many zone-free dvd players), but the bonuses are not very interesting (among others, where is the deleted scene with the twin towers ? Ah well...)All in all, the movie is still great but the DVD is ..., so that averages at 3 stars in my book."
3,not so cool,"this movie it wasnt too bad, but it wasnt so cool. i expected more, action. The end, was a ""fast-ending"", like they dont know what ending they will put. anyway, I dont see on the dvd special features, deleted scenes. One of my favorite trailer is the one that the helicopter get stuck between the 2 towers of the World Trade Center (R.I.P). Thats my favortie part and its not on the dvd..."
1,stupid!,The whole dang thin was so fake! I can't believe other people like it! Go see STAR WARS instead!
3,GOOD ONE,"Though the movie is not that much entertaining, it speaks about more technology and visual effects."
1,I agree with [other reviewer],"This movie is awful. The only characters that have characters are the evil ones. Spiderman's girfriend's hair cannot be that red. The last lines were so lame I died laughing. Where was Peter Parker learning his new powers? Do movie makers know the word ""forshadowing."" Simply not worth the time. The beginning had me falling asleep and the touching ending had me laughing out loud. The girl playing Peter Parker's love interest need dental work.Rent Dagon, not Spiderman."
3,"Good Movie, But The Ending Ruins It","The movie I could say was pretty good, the costumes were well done, the computer graphics were well played, Toby Maguire and Kirsten Dunst were good as the leading parts. However, if you like movies that have a romantic ending, this is not the movie for you. I won't give away what happend, but the way the movie endend seemed like a total waste.The way it ends may satisfy a guy, but girls who see this movie may be a little dissapointed.I enjoyed Spider Man, but I had to give it 3 stars because of the way it ended."
2,HOW DID THIS BECOME SUCH A HIT????,"Usually, I'm open to movies, and I'm far fromt picky about what I'll go to see, or what I'll be dragged off to have to see. But this movie was very disappointing. I've never been a Spiderman fan, but I've never been a Batman and Superman fan either, and I like most of those movies. I guess the reason I don't like this one is that it takes the word 'corny' to a faraway demention. Oh yes, it has some touching moments, and some funny ones. The kissing scene between McGuire and Dunst has become pretty popular, and it will continue to be famous. Willem Dafoe is creepy enough, but then again he's always creepy.So, to conlcude, it was good, but it just wasn't THAT good."
4,Marvel Films definitely has their act together,"I don't get as excited about a man swinging around a cityscape in tights as I would have at age eleven, but Raimi's film version of the classic Marvel comic character stands as one of the best film translations of a comic book to date. He manages to weave the classic Spider-Man origin story with an effective plotline, well-developed characters, and reality-bending special effects. I saw this in the theater in 2002, but my wife wanted to watch the DVD after the recent ""Spider-Man 2"" trailers piqued our interest. Tobey Maguire is an inspired choice for the mild-mannered Peter Parker-turned-webcrawler, and Willem Dafoe plays a sufficiently nasty villain in the Green Goblin. It's almost enough to wash the terrible taste of Warner Bros. last three ""Batman"" movies out of my mouth..."
3,"Shame on you, Columbia, for making us buy a 3rd copy!!!","The only redeeming value of this disc, besides the Superbit transfer, is an exclusive Tobey Maguire commentary track recorded for a 1-time-only web-showing of the movie in 2003. The upcoming Deluxe version of the movie DOES NOT have this commentary track, and there's no other features to this disc.So, if all you collectors want EVERYTHING there is to Spider-Man, you'll have to buy the discontinued collector's gift set (to get all the comics, Stan Lee DVD, senitype, and lithograph), the Deluxe version (for all the extras), and the Superbit version (for the Maguire commentary track)."
3,the movies good but somewhere in there it runs out of fumes,"good old fashioned comic book brought to life with Tobey Maguire, key as Peter Parker, but it sorta thins out in areas. Willem Dafoe, James Franco, Kirsten Dunst, Cliff Robertson, Rosemary Harris, J.K. Simmons, Gerry Becker, Bill Nunn, Bruce Campbell, Jayce Bartok, Lucy Lawless, Macy Gray and Stan Lee, the man himself appears, Lee also was in the movie Mallrats, you can see him in Daredevil and The Hulk as well with Lou Ferrigno. a must see for fans though"
4,Spider-Man.. Rating not high enough. On a 1-5 scale 4*s,"Spider-Man... Would I see the movie agian, yes! Would I have picked other actors to play the two lead roles Mary-Jane Watson and Peter Parker, yes. Ok... maybe not for the part of Mary-Jane, but for the part of Peter Parker, yes. Maguire wasn't a bad choice he just made the character look sickly to me. Casting could have picked another Spider-Man/Peter Parker.I did enjoy the computer graphics animation. The movie is definately worth a look at on the big screen. Very action packed. Though I gave this movie 4 stars that does not do it justice. On a scale of 1-10. This movie is an 8 1/2.Recommend! However could be scary for young fans."
5,"YES, they didnt ruin spiderman","Well i have been a spiderman fan for years, and when i heard the news last year about a movie in producion, i was excited.. but most of all , worried. the last thing we needed was another x-men. but sam raimi did it... he put his great directing, with great actors to bring us a amazing movie on the best comic series ever... everyone go see it right away! i already own a bootleg... cripes, im obsessed."
1,Does not live up to the hype...,"Spider-man in no way lives up to the reviews and acclaim from fans of the movie. Yeah sure, there are visual effects that left some people ... in awe, but they left me saying ""how cheesy..."" The special effects are no greater than any other new movie, and in fact, without these effects, there really is little plot left to this movie. And when you think about the plot, you realize that there is no substance, no soul to this ""blockbuster"". It is merely Hollywood's newest excuse to capitalize on a franchise. That is all Spider-man is- an attemp to gain truckloads of money by making 4 or 5 sequels. And I dread the day the Spider-man II comes out, because I know that it will only lead to Spider-man 3,4,5,and 6. Lets face it- sequels are never as good as the original..."
1,Bad Movie,"I didn't go in the movie theatre expecting a lot, and even those expectations did not stand for long. The special effects - the only strength that this movie could have - were corny and cliched. What tops them all is the shot of peter climbing on the ""wall"" - clearly he was climbing on the floor and thd shot was on its side. The characters? Again, cliche after cliche. Bad guys look evil, good guys look like saints. And don't even get me started on the green goblin - was that supposed to be funny? The dialogue was horrible too... Don't see this movie. Maybe if I were a spidey fan i would think twice, but since i'm not - here it is."
3,simply adequate when it should have been great (No spoilers),"The first thirty minutes had me smiling, but after the initial setup the movie falls apart and feels very episodic. Why? Because the villain had no plan to carry off, so the hero had no goal to reach. The climax was [disappointing] as well -- not enough at stake. The production design was cool, but the lighting overall was flat -- it looked like a TV movie (and what was up with all that _graininess_ during some of the CGI-heavy sequences? Were they re-rendering frames up until the last minute?) I have other gripes as well, but the overall crime here is that what should have been a great movie turned out to be simply mediocre. The Spiderman I know and love still lives in the 1967 animated TV series.Kirsten Dunst has grown up to be a real hottie though."
5,Youngest Spidey Fan,"I may only be 4 (almost 5) years old, but I know my superheroes. My first favorite hero was Batman, then I found Power Rangers. But my favorite hero of all is SPIDER-MAN and I haven't even seen the movie yet, just some cartoons! I often wear my spider-man costume and wrestle my Mom and Dad pretending they're the bad guys. I told my Mom that when I grow up I want to be Spider-man and save all the people. We're all counting the days until the movie comes out because we know it's going to be THE BEST MOVIE EVER!!"
1,OVER-RATED TRASH,"This movie was mediocre at best.I was reading the other reviews & didn't know if I should laugh or cry.One guy was saying how Tobey Maguire was perfectly cast;I've seen more emotion out of a brick.The people that say the effects were so seemless should rush to the optometrist immediately. I mean come on,I thought I was watching a video game...from a few years ago.This movie is only slightly better than the FF movie from a few years ago.I can't believe the same company that did the effects for LOTR did these effects.Clearly they put all their energy into the far superior LOTR.Thank God Daredevil & X2 came out to wipe the bad taste of a poorly done superhero movie out of my mouth."
3,Spiderman,"i liked this movie. but... yes but it seemed weak and slow and sometimes boring. i liked tobey maguires portrayal, his mannerisms and he did an excellent job playing Peter Parker. The one liners and punchlines were few but nonetheless funny. still it makes for a good popcorn flick. maybe the dvd will have some cool extras..."
3,Spider-Man: far from perfect,"Although, Spider-Man has its flaws, I can still say that it was a decent viewing experience overall. It has its cheesy moments and corny dialogue, but it also had its truly entertaining moments, such as Peter Parker discovering his newfound powers for the first time. But was Tobey Maguire a good choice for this role? Oh yeah, by the way Jaime from Toronto, don't say Lord of the Rings is dumb. I don't think you have any idea what spectacular filmmaking is. But then again you're from Canada."
4,A Pretty Good Movie to Start off The Summer,"Athough this might not have been my favourite movie I saw this year, I can't sit her and cut it up. Spiderman didn't ever really apply to me because I was never a fan of the comics books. But Tobey Maguire did do an excellent job. He really put a lot of work into his role.So I did have to take that into consideration. But it still wasn't my favourite. But a great kick to the hot movie summer!"
4,Packed with loads of goodies,"Having wondered how some of the tricks of the trade were handled and some shots were filmed with all the special effects, I really enjoyed the commentaries available on the audio tracks, as well as the spidey pop-ups done in VH1 pop-up video fashion. For those of you who watch t.v. as much as movies on dvd/video- you'll know what I'm talking about. The pop-ups really told me some quite interesting facts about the movie and not just all the technical mumbo-jumbo, but the little things about the movie that you never would have thought to consider asking about. I watched the dvd 3 times in a row and each time it was like watching a different movie. The added features with the cd-rom portion on it are quite cool as well, being able to record your own commentary. I liked the movie a lot but I liked the dvd a lot more. All in all, for the average price you will pay, buying Spiderman is worth the buck. You can't go wrong."
2,"Nothing ""Special"" about this edition","... this has got to be one of the worst ""Special Editions"" around. The movie is great but the EPKs ... big time.It has barely anything substantial. It's predominantly various interviews with the cast and Stan Lee and they talk exactly the same thing in each interview; with about half a dozen clips from the movie that repeat several times over. There is no actual behind-the-scenes nor any of the teasers that were immensely popular 8-12 months prior to the movie release.The concept art gallery was good but they could have included some more. Probably the only positive thing I found on the ""Special Edition"" was the Activision game demo. But for the people who already have the game...oh well.Definitely a huge disappointment for me. Wish the studio had spent a little from the millions they earned in the box-office to make make this DVD a true ""special Edition"" for the fans."
2,Extremely Dissapointing Extras!!!,"I love the movie, I think it is wonderful. However I was EXTREMELY dissapointed with the bonus features. With two discs you would think that they could have put the deleted scenes in there somewhere. My main purpose in buying it was for the now infamous cut scene with the twin towers. I would have returned it but my husband wouldn't let me."
2,Spiderman DVD Collector's gift set isn't that good!,"I love the movie! It is literally a comic book page that has come to life. But the Collector's edition is a farce. For the so called ""collectible"" items you receive it is way over priced. First you receive a cheesy reprint of the first Spiderman story. Big deal! You can get that at almost any comic shop. Second, a John Romita and Romita Jr. print. It's really cool! It's the first Spiderman cover redrawn by these two legends. The problem......it's not even autographed individually. John Romita Jr's. autograph is printed on it. Come on guys.... you could have the thing signed. Third, you receive a 35mm cell. Fine. It's not numbered. Gee.....how collectible. Fourth, It has an additional DVD with Stan Lee and Kevin Smith. Ok...fine. Bottom line is....I have a cool movie and a nice box to keep some comic books in."
4,As advertised,"The DVD arrived on time and played start to finish without issue. The outer cellophane had been removed, a UPC sticker was placed over the original UPC, and the case was re packaged. The UPC sticker was difficult to remove, but the anti-tamper seal was still intact so it seems the case was never opened."
4,My favorite action hero,"I've always appreciated Spider Man (Spidey) because he's like a real person with real problems. I loved Toby Maguire and Kirsten Dunst in their roles as Peter Parker and the girl next door. This was an epic movie that covered a lot of ground in Spiderman's early life, explaining how he got to be what he became.What I like most of this movie is the depiction of Spidey's city, New York with touches of Chicago and made in a fantasyland of good people and some hardcore villains. My least favorite dimension was surprisingly a good part of the action and special effects. I expected to like the spiderlike scenes more, but they seemed repetitious and overly long to me. I recommend the movie but without the one hundred percent endorsement I expected."
3,Nothing special,I've been a spidy fan for ever and when I saw they were making a movie I thought Awesome.The move was'nt bad but tobey in the peter Parker role was a disapointment for me after reading the comics.He made a pretty good spidy but Peter he did not.
5,"Great movie , sound and image","It worths it to own it as one the the Sci-fi modern Classics, wonderful F/X, sound and photo, very entertaining movie,great actors"
4,serious fun!!!,"I'm an old school spidey fan and I just saw the movie. I came out of it with a stupid grin on my face and it's still on as I write this. The movie lived up to all the hype and exceeded my expectations. Go see the film, you won't be disappointed. It has all of the touches that only Marvel could reproduce. I'm so glad they stayed true to the characters and dimensions of Spidey's personality. the poses and flight scenes were fantastic. I haven't gone back to see a film in a long, long time, but I think I might sneak back to the theatre to see this one again. enjoy!!!"
3,Not So Good,"You'll be able to sit through it, but that's about all. Weren't you comic fans expecting a whole lot more from this flick? It's not awful, but it doesn't deliver."
5,An Amazing Beginning To Perhaps A Great Series!,"...The special effects are absolutely superb, while sometimes they do over-exaggerate on them, they are nonetheless overwhelming. I'm a moderate fan of Spider-Man, owning two Playstation games, and soon this video, but if you're a fan of Stan Lee's excellent comic book, web-slinging super hero, you definitely should look into this. I personally believe that they followed the original story almost 100%, and give an excellent performance. Other than the somewhat 'over-exaggereated' graphics or special effects, this movie was an extremely cool beginning."
5,Possibly the best Comic Book movie ever.,"Tobey Maguire is outstanding as Peter Parker, the nerdy high school student who moonlights as Spider-Man. I absolutely loved this movie. It was definitely better on the big screen but you still get the feel of it on DVD. Willem Dafoe plays a terrific villan and is very eerie. I thought it was well written and acted. I highly recommend this movie to all ages. It sure beats some of the other comic book movies that were so awful, words can't describe (Tank-girl, Judge Dredd, Batman Forever, etc) I think it's the best movie to date."
1,"In the words of Comic Book guy, ""Worst movie ever.""","This movie was monumentally bad. I was blown away by how truly awful this film was. It didn't come close to any of the Batman or Superman movies, not even the duds like Batman and Robin or Superman III. Even for a superhero flick this was thin, foolish, convoluted, and just overall no fun at all. If you want a good comic book movie, go buy the original Batman with Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson. And, at all costs, avoid this travesty of a summer ""blockbuster""."
1,What was this,"Granted the first say 15 minutes of this movie was ok, but the rest has led me to label this movie one of the biggest disapointments and over praised movies ever. As a casual fan of spiderman I thought the visual effects seemed childish to the mastery of the visual art as presented in Star wars attack of the clones. Further the love story was even worse. The best movie of 2002 was not Spider Man. That honor i would humbly give to Atack of the clones or the Oedopian Minority Report."
2,Suprized,To see how bad they let us down. i was expecting much more. I wanted my money back after seeing the film. The best part was the first hour. After that it went down hill.
2,Boring,I wasn't very impressed with this movie at all. I expected a lot more from Spiderman it didnt' seem to hold true to the comics.
2,"Same old, same old.","Tobey Maguire makes an incredibly cheesy Spiderman. The special effects aren't that bad, but I've seen much better. There's nothing really new about this superhero flick, just the same old good-vs.-bad junk."
3,"Good, but a little thin","An above average movie version of a comic book superhero. It is fun, exciting, and pretty true to the source material. However, it is a bit lacking in emotional drama. Toby Maguire does do a good job with Peter Parker, and Aunt May and Uncle Ben are both well-rounded characters. There is both good conflict and good comic relief in the form of Flash Johnson and J. Jonah Janeson. But Mary Jane is lacking in much depth, and The Green Goblin is almost a caricature of a comic book villian. This seems a good start, but there will need to be more character development to make me really feel for these characters.While I am an avid comic book fan, and I enjoy the occasional Spider-Man story, Spider-Man has never really hooked me. This movie felt the same way: an enjoyable story and some good characters, but that's about it. I will look forward to the next movie, but not as much as I will look forward to others."
3,ONE-HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THIS??,"Everyone's favourite webslinger gets the big-screen treatment at last, but disappoints not only comic book afficiondos but fans of director Sam Raimi as well, and in a rare feat for Hollywood, SPIDER-MAN'S shortcomings lie not so much with the script as they do with the film's expensive but decidedly un-special special effects. Indeed, the only less-convincing CGI performance of the past year belongs to Sarah Michelle Gellar in SCOOBY-DOO. X-MEN is a far better film and cost a lot less to make. Despite fine performances from Willem DaFoe and Tobey Maguire, this SPIDER-MAN has surprisingly limp wrists."
2,Not what I was expecting...,"I'm a big Spider-man fan, and I know one thing, that Spider-man: The movie could be anything, but true to the comics.<br />I have all the first magazines published and from the beggining, Spider-man always used a web shooter and not web coming out of his wrists. That was a great error that they made on this movie. The other big error is that Spidey never met Mary Jane before he fought the Green Goblin, actually, the first guy he fought was the Chameleon, took him about another 5 vilains to fight before he fought the green goblin the first time, and he never really killed him!!! A big hoax, that's what this movie is! <br />It is great to have a spidey movie, but they could at least not invent so many stuff, they could respect a little bit more Stan Lee's idea."
5,This movie is awesome !,this carries the true spirit of Spider-man and of a superhero . this dvd will be great for every avid fan of spider-man and then some.
4,Fun Movie!,"I was never much into the Spider-Man comic books,but I decided to go see this movie anyway.It turned out to be a pretty good movie.The funnest parts for me were when Spider-Man was flying through NYC shooting his webs.This may sound a bit strange,but at times I almost felt like I was right there flying with him!!!This movie dragged on a little at times,but overall I was quite satisfied in my choice of seeing this film.Can't wait for the DVD and Spider-Man 2,should be fun!!!"
5,Finally,"Finally someone realized that it's not just about the powers and the gadgets, but the person too."
4,Flat out fun,"An enormous sucess at the box office, ""Spider-Man"" is pure entertainment. With great action scenes and surprisingly good performances, one wonders why it's not perfect.It's not a perfect movie, to be sure, but it approaches greatness when it comes to Tobey Maguire's portrayal of Peter Parker, who ultimately becomes Spider-Man. Willem Dafoe is superb as the villain; Rosemary Harris and Cliff Robertson offer great support as Peter's aunt and uncle.The special effects work, even if they seem a bit cartoonish in some parts. But for simple, flat out fun, you can't beat this movie. Usually, I'm pregidous towards blockbusters like these, but ""Spider-Man"" really deserves all its popularity."
3,OK,"The movie is loud, boring, awesome and breathtaking at the same time. The Movie is OK though I really hate the green goblin actor he annoys the crap out of me, if he wasnt in it, it'll e a different story. The movie is a dullishly ok version of the comic. THE DVD features are amazing though! It is absolutely awesome! The E! Documentary is a highlightOverallMovie : 3 / 5Special Features: 5+++/ 5"
5,Spidey Rules!!!,"I know very little about Spider-Man but I have always enjoyed the cartoon and the few comics I have picked up. Sitting down expecting great special effects, I was surprised by the plot, acting and special effects in the movie. I liked how the Rami put in the wrestling, just like Peter Parker in the comics.Toby was an excellent Spider-Man, very convincing as a person who is shy and sticks to himself. His infatuation with MJ was discreet but, still visible to all around. (kind of like Superman and Lana)The special effects with Spider-Man and the Green Goblin were incredible. Although they were not necessarily realistic looking they were pleasing to the eye and kept you at the edge of the seat.Great movie. Definetly a buy when it comes out on VHS/DVD."
5,Comic book Come back,"I never really liked comic books or even cartoons for that matter but I really loved spider-man. It was alot deeper than most action/super hero movies and Tobey Maguire did an amazing job! I think anyone, even if u havnt read ths comic, should go see this movie, its definatley worth the time"
1,Corny Movie!,"Although I am a fan of Spiderman this movie did not do any justice to the Spiderman series. Lines were cheesy and they could have done a better job on picking out a better actor for Spiderman. Tobey Mcguire just was not a good Peter Parker/Spiderman. Don't waste your money on buying this movie, it's too corny."
1,Scared Miss Muffet from the theater!,One of the most irreverent films. The characters in this film are 2-dimensional. The storyline is not that strong. The storytelling is choppy and disjointed. Some of the effects don't look too impressive because you can see that it's been computer generated.Kids will enjoy it for its sophomoric action. Not a film that will enrich the mind.
1,Does not live up to the hype...,"Spider-man in no way lives up to the reviews and acclaim from fans of the movie. Yeah sure, there are visual effects that left some people ... in awe, but they left me saying ""how cheesy..."" The special effects are no greater than any other new movie, and in fact, without these effects, there really is little plot left to this movie.

1,Does not live up to the hype...,"Spider-man in no way lives up to the reviews and acclaim from fans of the movie. Yeah sure, there are visual effects that left some people in awe, but they left me saying ""how cheesy..."" The special effects are no greater than any other new movie, and in fact, without these effects, there really is little plot left to this movie.

4,SONY LETDOWN,"I AM FED UP WITH COMPANIES DOUBLE AND TRIPLE DIPPING CONSUMERS INTO BUYING DVDS THAT ARE DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF THE ORIGINAL. IN THIS CASE WE GET NOTHING THAT WE REALLY WANT. SUCH AS THE ""FREAKIN ORIGINAL TEASER TRAILER!!!"" I WAS TRICKED AGAIN INTO WASTING MY MONEY INTO BUYING SOMETHING I THOUGHT WAS ""SPECIAL"" OR ""DELUXE"" BUT THERE ISN'T ANYTHING DELUXE ABOUT THIS 3 DISC SET. IF YOU HAVE THE ORIGINAL SET SAVE YOUR MONEY. THOSE COWARDS AT SONY STILL DON'T HAVE THE BALLS TO GIVE US WHAT WE WANT LIKE DELETED SCENES WITH THE WORLD TRADE CENTER OR AT LEAST THE TEASER TRAILER."
5,One of the best movies I've seen in years,First of all I wasn't a huge Spiderman fan before the movie came out in theatres. I was very suprised on how good the special effects were. The only problem with the movie was that the Green Goblin looked like a Power Ranger. If they make a sequal they should make the villian look more realistic. Other than that I thought the movie was great. I thought that Toby Maguire and Kirstin Dunst made a great team. I would recommend this movie to viewers of all ages. It is pretty graphic it may not be suitable to childeren of younger ages
5,Super Cool!!,"This is one of the movies I seen this super hero and I thought he was a stupid man ,but now he is one of my favorite hero . This movie is great and it is very surprising in the end too."
5,"Spider-man, Spider-man! Does whatever a spider can....","This is a wonderful movie that is true to its comic book. It has followed the boundaries that were made for it. Tobey Maguire did a wonderful job as the one, the only, Spider-man! This is a movie that can hit close to home at some parts. It has so much eye candy that makes you want to watch it over and over again. The special effects were wonderful! I recommend this movie, although the plot isn't as profound or have as many hidden meanings as other movies, it's still a great find."
1,its a shame i cant give this no stars,"This film is very bad.1.There is about 50 mistakes in the film2.very boring3.the fighting is bad, some one needs to tell Toby how to fight4.special effects are bad5.the green gobil looks bad6.spider man fancies Mary and when she finally asks him out, he turns her away, this is very bad7.the acting is bad, Toby Maguire and Kirstin Dunst, need I say more.8.Basically this film is bad and should be thrown in the bin and never watched again, Why? cus its bad."
3,Good but not Great...,"Spiderman was a lot of hype. It was over-rated and the movie just wasn't all that great. The producers could have did so much more with that huge budget. Maybe the ""Hulk"" will be better..."
2,Very so-so. Really 2.5 stars.,"There was plenty to enjoy in this film. The action sequences were good, and I felt that the character was treated fairly well. However, the CGI could have used a little more work, and the dialogue was actually quite bad.It wasn't a bad film. But it didn't really break any new ground. Better than the live-action Batman films by a mile, worse than the first Superman film. Also not as good as X-Men."
1,Bad choice,"The quality is REALLY POOR, the DVD isn't compatible with PowerDVD XP you don't know where you are in the menu, and there is a big sound problem.Also, the menu is slow (even with InterActual Player). And it's not my computer, (Athlon 2000+) ...The track are not in dolby digital.So I'm pretty disapointed about it.I hope sony will make a better version because this one just ****"
3,Excessive Graphic Violence,"I went with my 4 year old grandson to see this movie. I realized it had a PG-13 rating but that isn't unusual in the more popular movies and he had seen movies rated at this level before. This movie was so havily marketed to young children, I thought it would be ok. I wish there had been a stronger warning as to the graphic violence at the end of the movie. It was hard to enjoy because my grandson was so upset. Television movies have a rating sytem that specifies the reason for the rating, perhaps it would be appropriate for movies to do the same."
2,What's all the fuss about?,"I missed it when it was at the cinemas, and many people said it was worth seeing. So, we hired the DVD the other night expecting to be dazzled. The film is so 'formula Hollywood' it's not funny! And to top it off, full of digital effects. It's not the worst film to come out this year, but far from the best. The only reason it has done so well is because it's a childrens film. Kirsten Dunst is miscast in this film, by the way."
2,Columbia's already committed to TWO sequels????,"Yes, I realize it's a comic book. Yes, I realize that this is aimed at the mentality of a 12-year-old boy (and hits a bulls-eye at that!) But come on! The writers went for the obvious every single time! And the scenes that were supposed to explore the romantic tension between the hero and his beloved made me laugh out loud every single time because it was so poorly written. And what was the Green Goblin trying to accomplish anyway? For a good comic-book movie, skip this dreck. Watch Tim Burton's Batman instead."
2,A real fan's point of view,"This movie reeked for the same reason most other superhero flicks did;they killed the villan.Why the studios don't think we will come back if they don't have the Hollywood ending.Most comic heroes didn't kill their adversaries.The Green Goblin killed himself after many years of battling Spidey.Why not stay true to the comic?Superman did;Lex Luthor made it through three movies.Why introduce a character that is a formidable enemy,just to kill him off in under two hours?If you select the pop-up fact feature on the dvd,it details everything the director butchered from the original comic.On it's own i did find it entertaining and fun to watch.It still would have been better had the Goblin cleverly escaped Spidey and exclaimed ""We'll meet again Spiderman!"""
3,"OK, but no show stopper","I liked this movie. I used to read Spiderman all the time in the paper. It tried to touch on too much all at once. It should have developed the characters more, since it is obviously set up for a sequel."
4,Great movie!,I thought Spider-Man was great but when I bought the DVD version for Widescreen and went home quick to watch it on my DVD player it only played Fullscreen and I couldn't get it to change because I got Pioneer. I went to a friend's house and watched it and it played Widescreen. I don't understand with DVD Player's these days because I mean I really want to watch a Widescreen version and I can't get the stupid remote to change it. It's dumb because in Fullscreen you cannot see anything but in Widescreen you can see everything. I love Widescreen the best and the DVD cover to Spider-Man of Widescreen is extremely cool. It's the way it meant to be because the cover is red just like the color of Spider-Man and that's why I bought the Widescreen version. Stick with the Widescreen.
3,whining too much,"Although I was impressed by the film in terms of story and the way it evolved, I got very annoyed at how he whined about his obligation to his new power.....his uncle's reminder about his responsibility........He mooned about MJ before he was bitten and loved her since they were how old? and now she confesses her love for him and he says ""no thanks, just a friend is all I will ever be"".........apparently he has no trust in her...I mean to share his big responsibility....his obligation to mankind.....I hope the second one is a bit more believable in terms of his relationship with other people....And by the way, when he finally finishes off the Dafoe character, I would have left him the way he fell than do him the favor of protecting his son from finding out what a jerk his father was."
4,Spider-man,"I am not a big fan of the comic book ,but this movie was incridably.I waited three years for it to come out and it was well worth the wait.It had great speciel effects,an outstanding cast,the CGI didn't look CGI and I was really suprised how it came out,I wish it was longer though.Tobey Macquire was perfect to play as spider-man,I was always a big fan of Kirsten Dunst and and Dafoe was creepy.Hopefully they make a sequel and the dvd comes out soon!"
1,Bad choice,"La qualité de l' image laisse vraiment a désiré, je suis certain que la version VHS est meilleur.Aussi, il y as une total incompatibilité avec PowerDVD XP:-On ne peux pas cliquer sur les item,-Il n' y as pas de pointeur, alors on ne sais pas ou on est dans le menu,-Les voix ne joue pasDonc, il faut absolument utiliser Interactual Player,et encore la, les menu sont LENT et la souris marche mal (il faut utiliser les fleches du claviers)Autre choses, aucune trame sonore n' est en Dolby Digital ... dumoins, si elles le sont, interactual les interpretes mal...Voila, je vous conseil d' essayer la version WideScreen, elle est peut etre mieux."
1,Does not live up to the hype...,"Spider-man in no way lives up to the reviews and acclaim from fans of the movie. Yeah sure, there are visual effects that left some people ... in awe, but they left me saying ""how cheesy..."" The special effects are no greater than any other new movie, and in fact, without these effects, there really is little plot left to this movie. And when you think about the plot, you realize that there is no substance, no soul to this ""blockbuster"". ... That is all Spider-man is- an attemp to gain truckloads of money by making 4 or 5 sequels. And I dread the day the Spider-man II comes out, because I know that it will only lead to Spider-man 3,4,5,and 6. ... ."
1,"I Hate to Say This, But ...","I'm sorry, but I hated this film. So much so that I refuse to see the second one.Tobey Maguire looks about 12. He did not convince me that even with super powers he could battle evil. ""I did all my own stunts."" Please! In just about all the action sequences, Spiderman was so cgi that he looked like a slimmed-down Shrek with red spandex on.The only positive feeling that this film left me with was knowing that I was right in all those school yard debates many years ago: ""Who is the better super-hero, Spiderman or Batman?"" I was on Batman's side, and this film made me feel all the more justified in my choice.I felt sorry for Kirsten Dunst. She's a good actress, and she got stuck with this.The best thing about it was it had a Nickelback song, and it's to Nickelback that my one lonely star for this film goes to.Sorry."
1,I wonder if Mr. Raimi ever read Spider-man...,"I can deal with:1. Mary Jane being a neighbor of the Parkers (what???)2. Green Goblin's Transformer face & costume3. Ohh yes, the terrible CGI...But Mary Jane falling off the bridge? next time read the comic, Mr. Raimi, or you could watch X-Men (I have to say that I'm not big fan of them) or Batman and learn how a good comic book based movie should be done. Take this from a 22+ year reader of Spider-man......to quote J. Jonah Jameson (BTW him was excellent) from the movie: ""crap...crap...mega crap"". If you still want to see this, erase from your memory all your existing knowledge of Spider-man."
1,Causes Arachnaphobia,"Not worth the time it takes to view it. Boring, long, dull, and the acting was poor as well. Don't bother."
1,spiderman?,"I thought about giving Spiderman 4 stars but decided against it. This is the most boring action movie I have ever seen. Aside from the horrible CGI, it really really drags. Over 2 hours??? Why? Throw out all the useless, underdeveloped character (Uncle Ben, Aunt May, Harry Osbourne, all the insignificant references to Spiderman comic book personalities), and you might end up with a decent 1 hr 40 min film. And no it did not follow the comic book. Anyone who says that is lying...all the more reason to get rid of some characters. I fear the coming of Spiderman 2, or as I will call it, Spiderman Again. I know it will be rehash becasue of Hollywood's unrelenting philosophy... ""If it makes a lot of money, make it again."""
1,"very diasppointing, VERY disappointing","No real plot, unrealistic characters, poor acting - what else can I say? And a terrible ending. Maybe it is true to the storyline used in the comic books, but it didn't make sense for the movie.Please note that my comments are based on *not* seeing the movie in the theater, but waiting to purchase the DVD to watch it in the comfort of our own home theater.One thing is for sure - we will be selling our Spider-Man DVD soon on eBay or giving it to the local Goodwill store. Maybe it is great for kids (but questionable with the violence), but a real dud for the 2 adults here (my wife and I) who watch lots of action adventure movies. This movie just didn't rate up there with others - way over hyped."
1,"Been there, done that...","It is simply amazing to me that this film has been as successful as it has. It is entirely unoriginal and very derivative of two previous ""super-hero"" films, namely ""Superman"" and ""Batman,"" and is not nearly as convincing. The script is poorly written with ham-fisted dialogue and Tobey Maguire's flippant portrayal of Spider-Man is irritating. Basically this is a Hollywood rehash cloaked behind hype and special effects."
4,You Are The Best Spidy!,"I'm a big fan of spider-man before the release of the movie, i have a almost all the comic of spiderman ,i was excited when i heard about the spider-man movie and very happy beacuse Sam Raimi will there direct it, i finally see it and is one of the best movies in 2002, the cast is terrific, Tobey Maguire was a outstanding, kristen Dusnt(she is very beautiful but never as Reese Witherspoon) did a excellent job, William Da Foe another outstanding actor and is a excellent villan, the visuals are Incredible,the New York city looks really really beautiful looks even better in the movie than in the real world,the direction is simply ""Perfect"",X-men are great too but i prefer spiderman by far, i put 4 stars beacuse Spider-Man 2 was bigger and better than the first spiderman.Story 10/10Acting 9/10Direction 10/10Visuals 10/10Overall 10/10"
5,Spidey returns with skill,"This movie was a great flick for fans of Spider-man. The cast of characters was great and I think they made great choices for the stars. The plot was exellent and the action scenes were unbelievable! This is a awesome film for anyone who loves superheros,action movies, or is just a fan of great films. I look forward to the next movie in the series!"
4,Very Good Movie.,"This is one heck of a good movie. I LOVE the Spider-Man movies. Even the animated ones. Peter Parker is an ordinary high school graduate until a field trip to a spider mueseum. One of the spiders on exhibit is missing. While Peter is taking pictures, it bites him. Now he becomes Spider-Man! Peter's friend's dad, Norman Osbourne is the bad guy, The Green Goblin. Now it is up to Spider-Man to kill the goblin and save the city!Rated: PG-13 For Action Violence.Running Time: 121 Minutes."
4,Hi.,"Spider-Man is a great movie, my second favorite of 2002 (behind a certain movie featuring hobbits), and anyone with a brain should see this. Peter Parker is a teenage wallflower that, once bitten by a genetically enhanced spider, turns into... a gymnast. Or at least he dresses like one. He gets many powers that spiders possess and uses them to fight crime after a carjacker murders his uncle. Mary Jane, Parker's dream girl, is dating Parker's friend, Harry. Harry's dad, Norman, is a corporate CEO manufacturing military upgrades. He tests them on himself once and goes nuts, becoming the major villain (and the only real one). Great DVD, better movie, definitely a must-own."
2,With a great budget comes great irresponsibility.,"A hokey script doesn't help matters either. This movie is tired, poor, boring, BADLY acted and VERY BADLY written. Can you believe the cheezy dialogue here? ""I swear Spider Man will pay... thank God for YOU, Peter."" It's like, why not throw in a wink too, there, Harry. And let's not forget Peter's tired ""sense of humor"". What does he say? Stupid 5h!+ like ""Hehe! Sure beats the subway!"" and ""nice outfit, did your husband buy it for you?"" This movie is TERRIBLE! The CGI is horrid as well. Spider Man hasn't looked THIS cartoony since the 1960 series. Green Goblin looks like an overgrown action-figure. Willem's acting reaches low camp. Kirstin Dunst is neither stunning nor talented. She is not Mary Jane. Just as Tobey is not Peter Parker. Comatose b@5+@rd. Let's hope this stupid 5h!t picks up in sequels like X-Men. What a stupid boring movie this is."
5,Living up to the hype!,"I just got from seeing a special screening of Spider-man. And I must say it surpassed all of my expectations. This movie is the best comic book movie in years, possibly ever. The joy of seeing Peter swing for the first time is only beat seeing memorable scenes relived in front of your eyes. Please, get to a movie theater as soon as you can, cause you'll just want as much time as you can to see it over and over again."
4,Very Very Fun,"Though it's full of some cheesy dialogue and bits of overacting, ""Spider-Man"" is still a great superhero movie and, in a lot of ways, paved the way for the success Marvel has had. A lot can be said for the film because it appealed not only to nerds and geeks, but to the mainstream movie-goer as well. Tobey McGuire may not have been the perfect choice, but he gives a great performance as the title character, which I can't say for Kirsten Dunst and Willem Dafoe."
2,No Special Features!,Blu-ray version looks great but NO SPECIAL FEATURES. No behind the scenes or commentary. Just be aware before you purchase this.
3,Not my favorite superhero movie,"I'm being nice with my rating. Spiderman is an OK and entertaining enough film, but thats it really. There could have been moments of greatness, but then the Green Goblin showed up...And then there is Kirsten Dunst. I found her completely dislikable, therefore, I couldn't really get into the whole romantic side of the film. The effects were the greatest part of the movie. As far as plot goes, it really could have been better. There are far more superior comic book films out there."
3,Flawed entertainment,"Spiderman is better than 3 stars but its not a 4 star movie. It starts well enough and Peter Parkers discovery of his new found powers is well done both in the School scenes and later in the wrestling/cage fight. The fight in the school is very well done and Parker's discovery of his new much faster reactions remains perhaps the highpoint of the film. Its in this section of the film that the director Sam Raimi's touch is most evident.However the film loses momentum and gets more and more predictable as it progresses and in the end was certainly too long. The leading actors did a fine job and the best thing in the film is Tobey Maquire, whose portrayal is spot-on. There are extras galore on disc 2 as well as commentaries on on disc 1. So it is certainly worth seeing (and at the Cinema it was very impressive) but it loses quite a lot on the small screen and I would only buy if cheap."
3,Please enter a title for your review,"If you calculated how many other scenes each scene has relevence to you could show this movie to be statistically less cohesive than most. That's the problem with comic book movies, they try to be an origin story and an ultimate showdown between good and evil and cram it all into 90 minutes. There's no ongoing story throughout most of the movie, every marked out plot point is hit and then forgotten, none having an elaborate enough resolution to engage you before they're over."
5,The Kick [butt] Spider-Man,"I went to go see spiderman the first day it came out, and it was the best movie I have ever seen in my life!!!!!! Spider-man kicks [butt]!!! He is the best marvel hero in the world today and think you stan lee for making him, he rocks the world!! I am a big fan of the cartoon series. ...That movie is worth seeing twice and 3 and 4 and 5 times, it is the tightest movie there is in history. All the people that made it, they did a kick [butt] job. Spider-Man rules the world!!!"
5,Get this movie! It's WAY COOL!,"Spiderman rocks. That's basically what I have to say. I wan't a Spiderman fan when I saw this movie in theatres, but the movie was awesome. It still is. This movie is about an ordinary teenager who gets superpowers. Then he has to save people, and stuff like that. Be a superhero. But he still has a crush on a girl he's known forever. This movie is great. It has action, sad stuff, parts that make you jump, and romance. Also, the DVD's special features are cool. It has info about how the movie was made, music videos ^_^, and tons of other stuff. I totally reccomend this movie, wether you're a Spiderman fan or not. It rocks."
3,Could have been so much better.,"This is an example of where the plot loses, once again to the effects. Don't get me wrong the effects are spectacular, and they are well woven into the story, but the plot is simply pathetic.The plot: boy gets bit by spider; troubled CEO tests himself on latest product with obvious results. CEO goes insane, runs round in plastic suit. ...Only one man can stop him - SPIDERMAN!!!Big battle - run credits.Even the sub-plot of the love affair and the eternal triangle between Peter Parker and his two best friends is slow and mangled.Bottom line - too slow, too simple, no twists, BUT great effects."
3,Some lag,This movie had some lag. There were 3 times while watching the movie that it had to reload for about 3-4 minutes.
2,Expected More - Got Less,"I wanted to like this movie a lot. But I was disappointed. The film dragged in places and was obviously heading for a sequel. The special effects were good, but couldn't move the film up in my estimation. The best part of the film was when he was trying to figure out how to shoot his web from his wrist. Having spent my $[money], I walked out of the theatre wishing I had spent it on renting two other films at my local video store."
1,Stupor-Man,"An incredibly boring, unimaginative, and viscerally unexciting adaptation of one of the world's most intriguing superheroes. Sadly, this film falls flat, weighted down by superficial writing, canned ham acting, and the lack of a premise.Largely a CGI-fest, Spider-man -- alongside films like MOULIN ROUGE and HARRY POTTER -- is a film that should never have been greenlighted ... much less greengoblinned."
2,SPIDEY FAN DISAPPOINTED AT THE BOX OFFICE,"When I first heard that my favorite animated superhero was coming to life, I could hardly wait for the release date. I looked forward to seeing Tobey Maguire (one of Hollywood's greatest at the moment) portray the web-slinging / wall-climbing friendly neighborhood Spider-man. Although his performance as Peter Parker by day, Superhero at night is right up there with any he has done, I was disappointed in the movie as a whole! The story line, even though true to the comic book and animated series, was too predictable and put me to sleep. I wish there would've been more twists in the plot or maybe an attempt for movie producers to create their own. Although my disappointment will not deter me from seeing the obvious sequel, I do hope that more effort is put into entertaining true fans."
4,Great Movie :4 1/2 stars!,"Ok, virtually everyone on the planet couldn't wait to see Spiderman (the sales from the weekend shows:$114million!!). The graphics were tight, the Green Goblin was just like he was in the cartoons (outside of the lifeless Goblin mask he wore in the movie), but otherwise, excellent fight scenes and special effects. there were only 2 complaints i had with this movie: 1-Why didn't the classic Spiderman song play at all in the movie???:-( and 2. some of the storytelling pauses in between the fight scenes were a little too long (my son started shifting around in his chair and so did other kids) but otherwise, it was a great movie and a recommended must-see!!"
5,I love Spider-Man!,"Hi! My name is Meredith. I am sure that I am the biggest fan of Spider-man the movie there is! So let me tell you what I thought about the movie. I would ovcourse give it 5 stars because it is my favorite movie ever! Two thumbs up! It really puts you in the movie! Thrilling Action! The best movie ever! It deserves more then 4 and a half stars! Come On! It is the best movie out there and you know it! I am a Spider-man wiz on the movie and the cartoons. ... If you have never seen the movie let me tell you a little about it. This is how the beginning goes I know because I have seen the movie 7 times! Who am I, you ask? Are you sure you want to know? You say you want to hear the story of my life. That story is not for the faint of heart. If somebody said that my life was a little happy tale, if somebody told you that I was just your average ordinary guy, without a care in the world........then somebody lied. That is all I can say for now but if you want to hear more just e-mail me!"
5,Tobey Maguire Best Superhero since Michale Keaton,"Tobey Maguire gives an excellent performance as the soft spoken Peter Parker. He was made for the part. Tobey was not particually big or buff, perfect for the Spider Man role. He also doubled as the lonely almost dorky Peter. Dunst gives a great performance. Willem Dafoe was a great villian except the plastic costume didn't really work. So, if you want pure but kickin' excitement see Spider Man!!"
4,Awesome Graphics!,"I almost didn't watch this movie--just not too big on Science Fiction types. However, I'm glad I decided to bring it home for the night.The story line is ok. Loner boy gets magic power, loses his uncle, and finds the ones he loves threatened by the mysterious Green Goblin.The best part of the movie are the incredible jump scenes where Spiderman hurtles himself through NYC. The fight scenes are also pretty neat...kind of reminiscent of The Matrix.If you want a movie that you watch strictly for the filming, this is probably it."
4,One Wild Ride!,"I have always been a Spiderman fan so I was pleased when they finally decided to make a movie out of the character. This movie is a lot of fun and true to the comic book hero. Some people have complained about the special effects not being that spectacular, but that's nitpicking. The actors and actresses play their roles well, and the movie holds your interest throughout. Even people who are not big comic fans will like this movie."
5,A Hero With Webbed Fingers,"Peter Parker/Spiderman (Tobey Maguire) and Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) were awesome characters! I mostly enjoyed the scenes where those two characters were together. Real romance! Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww! I even loved the scene where Mary Jane said she loved Peter. Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww! Move over Harry Osbourne, and move on to Peter Parker! Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww!"
3,okay,"I saw spiderman in the treatres and thought it was the most awesomw thing in the world. And then I bought it when it same in. it wasnt as good without the audiance, surround sound, and trailers. plus the dvd itself wasnt too good nor were the speical feature.its a good time killer though."
5,Great movie; insignificant flaws,"By all accounts this was an excellent movie, but it was somewhat disappointing in certain aspects. Tobey Maguire is a good actor, don't get me wrong.. yet he didn't have that superhuman quality that he should've. Spider-Man should've been somebody taller, with a deeper voice, and an unknown. To put a known actor in a movie about a superhero sort of trashes it in ways, like Val Kilmer and George Clooney for the last two installments of the ""Batman"" series. Every time I saw Clooney, I thought of ""E.R."" and ""Three Kings"", not the dark knight. But enough about that, the focus of this review is basically how they should've gotten somebody else for the hero besides Tobey Maguire. All-in-all though, I really enjoyed the movie. As to how closely it followed the comics, I think they were very spot-on (with a very small number of exceptions). It's worth getting on DVD or VHS, either way it makes a great addition to anyone's video library."
3,The start of something better,"Aiming squarely at the teen audience was clearly the right choice in terms of the box-office (where it left even ""Episode II"" in the dust), but I can't help feeling some depth has been lost in the pursuit of digital delight. And in the end, the effects don't look as real as they should (nor give us anything we didn't see in the trailers). Fortunately, ""Spider-Man"" is saved from being just another big-budget Hollywood blowout by the guileless performance of Tobey Maguire and the lightly humorous touch of Sam Raimi and his writers. A darker tone and a more complex story might have made this more interesting, but they can wait for any one of the numerous sequels which are undoubtedly well on their way. It isn't a great film, but it's an entertaining start to what should be a highly entertaining franchise."
2,to spidey or not to spidey,"There are a lot of reviews here that speak about how the movie stayed faithful to the comic book. I sadly beg to differ.Spider man never had webs oozing out from his anatomy, he had to sweat in his private lab to devise a gadget that would sling the web.The movie keeps dropping hints about Peter Parkers phenomenal scientific intellect but there is nothing in the moive that seems to point in that direction.The Green Goblin looks like a robotic contraption unlike the comic book. Also PETER DOES NOT GRADUATE WITH THE REST OF HIS CLASS.This is in no way a faithful comic book adaptation.This is a sugar sweet schmucky movie with bad dialogues , bad cgi and mediocre performances catering to the 8 year old bed wetting crowd.SNAP OUT OF IT."
1,Love Story in Disguise,"This movie was terrible, Toby Mcg. can't act, the girl is also terrible and annoying. This is a good movie to get dragged to by your girlfriend or wife. Might as well be named Maid in Manhattan. Dumb movie don't waste your money even to rent. Over rated piece of garbage. Be Warned"
3,Whats all the hype about?,"3 Stars. Okay, I'm a teenager and heard all the hype about this movie and how it was sooooo great, and how everyone has to see it. So, I bought it on dvd when it came out. This must be a mistake! How could a movie like this make 115 million dollars its first week? Its not a horrible movie, but the only redeeming value in this movie is the special effects, the action, and the bonus features if you're into that kind of thing. The acting is not amazing. This movie is good for a renting, but don't buy it unless you really love it, cause after watching it more than twice, as I had it got boring."
4,"Great CGi, good movie, mediocre plot",Spider-Man is one of the better comic book adaptations to come to the big screen. I was surprised that Toby Maguire did a great job as the young superhero. Dafoe's sinister green goblin was exquisite as well. Some of the best scenes are Spider-Man swinging from building to building--those are just jaw-dropping awesome. The plot is mediocre though. It is an excellent choice to watch though and surprisingly fun.
1,Disappointed in the Movie,"Too much violence, not enough story line. My Seven Year-Old Grandson won't be able to watch this until he is much older!"
1,movie,The disc came to me with a huge sticky smudge all over it along with several deep scratches. Therefore the disc would not play even after I cleaned it as best as possible.
5,Tobey Maguire is forever spiderman,"One of the big flops of Batman is that Micheal Keaton wouldn't do the sequels. As long as they keep the same character, any new sequels can be just as good as this one!"
4,"I waited, and it was worth the wait.","This much hyped DVD/movie was worth the wait. I am not a big fan of Tobey Maguire (what were his parents spelling-names challenged?), but he does a great job in this flick. William Dafoe is the perfect enemy for spiderman, and Kirsten Dunst does a great job of being the flighty romantic lead woman. All in all, they did justice to the Spiderman legend and this was a great work. The special effects displayed in this movie were dazzling and the Computer Generated Images were cutting edge. The sequel, which I am sure they are hot to make another few hundred million dollars on, will be good as well. This movie rates as an A- in my book.Joseph Dworak"
2,Sub-quality material,"Unfortunately this item arrived cracked. Amazon immediately sent a new one, however the quality of the DVD material was of sub-quality and it cracked again within the first month."
5,Happy,My son loves this movie. We got this to replace the vhs and I know this will be well loved. Great price and fast shipping. A+
5,A Great Movie In The Mighty Marvel Tradition,I thought that Spider-Man was a great movie because of the story and the action. It made me think that someone can step up and be a hero(even if someone has no super powers). I also thought that the characters were handled very well(especially Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson) and that the movie stayed faithful to what made Spider-Man great over the years.I definitely recommend this movie to everyone(even if you're not a comic book fan) .
2,tired,"This movie is everything I expected, a fine adaptation of a great comic, following the trend of X-men. But it is nothing more. If you want all of the excitement without the recycled hollywood superhero try reading the comic books. The only thing that might be worse is the new Ben AssFleck superhero movie."
4,A nice light movies,"I enjoyed this DVD (just got it for Christmas). I did not see the film in the theatres, so I miss some of the roller coaster ride you get from the giant screen. Tobey Maguire was perfect for Peter Parker. I enjoyed his almost clueless personality; an direct opposite of Spiderman's heightened senses.They could have found someone else for Mary Jane. I am not a big Dunst fan, and it was hard to get past that.The supporting material on the DVD is great. I enjoyed the interviews with the previous artists and writers of Spiderman. Also I really enjoyed the bio of composer Danny Elfman (one of my favorite musicians). If you enjoy comic book movies that are not as dark as Spawn, this will be a great addition for you."
3,ok,This movie had a good comic book feel and the characters were very likable but parts were a little over the top and I found myself laughing! Something to check out anyway. It is still entertaining and fun to watch!
4,Good movie,"This movie is really fun.I grew up on Spiderman, GI Joe and Heathcliffe and while I don't think I would've been disappointed by this movie if it came out then (although it's not as good as the '89 Batman movie w/ Jack Nicholson, not even close).The acting was very good.Even though I think Kirsten Dunst is a big dork for lying to the cops on her Punk'd episode, I think she did very well.Definitely worth watching, even if you have to see it on TV with commercials.I wouldn't go as far as saying it's worth buying though but most people I know bought it so, hey, give it a shot!!"
2,Ho hum,"Clark runs to the rescue and opens his shirt to show his ""S"" uniform. Superman introduces himself to the public by doing several super hero activities. Lois Lane falls form a building and is saved by Superman. Perry White berrates Clark Kent and the staff. Luthor and the super-villains from Krypton - General Zod, Urza, et.al attack the Daily Planet offices. People gather infront of City Hall before the Jokers attacks. Lots of big ballon- figures fly in the air and thereafter the Joker attacks. The Joker laughs horrifically and has a split personality. Yep the same scenes are present in Sam Raimi's film, except that the character is Spider-man. Is it any wonder that I feel like I've seen this film before. Hey Stan (Lee), this is definitely a brand echh movie. It seems like Irv Forbush directed this one. I hope the sequel is all Marvel."
2,Amazingly poor,"I can't get over how bad this movie is, and I know this is the last time I give one of these re-hashed Marvel guys a break.One more long, significant pause as Toby wetly contemplates his boring new powers. Another cringing romantic moment. Yet another wet look from Toby. Wow! Really awful animation!I think it would help if you were seriously drunk, since the action won't look so terrible, and you'll simply sleep through the rest. I, however, was almost sober."
5,Ultimate Movie Matrix's Little Brother,"I just saw this movie on opening night here and as expected, it was packed. I waited for 3 hours before getting my ticket, but it was worth it. The special effects were breath-taking, the cast was the best, the showdown was excellent. I think this is better than the Matrix. It only had one problem that would have givin it 3 stars, but the plot, cast, special effects, and showdowns were too good. The problem was that most of the movie's special effects moved so fast, it was impossible to watch it all without getting a headache. But, this is the best movie I have ever seen. It is a must see to ever Marvel marveller and to newcomers as well."
2,overrated,"simple as that. the movie was overrated and cheesy. toby mcguire looks like he's constantly seeing a ghost, and the green goblin looks like a retarded power ranger. the only fun thing in this movie when he'd go from building to building. other than that, if you had no idea who spiderman was and saw this movie, you'd think he was a manic depressive, because mcguire acts like one throughout the whole movie. spiderman needs to take some zoloft."
2,"excellent film , DVD aspect ratio is not 2.35:1",Contrary to what is listed in the technical info. section the aspect ratio of the widescreen DVD is 1.85:1 (fullscreen 16x9) and not 2.35:1 (true letter box)
4,IMPRESSIVE!,I finally saw the movie and what can I say it was awesome especially when he swings through the buildings the grapics are also bad ... . The only flaw was that the green goblin didn't really look like a green goblin he looked more like a transformer character but I liked it and I will go see it again. I recomend for comic viewers!
3,Too much hype!,"Peter Parker was such a nice boy with a very nice Aunt and Uncle. It was a storybook family picture, which was refreshing. The part of the movie that turned me off, was the disrespect that Peter showed his Uncle in one scene. The love and support Peter got from his Aunt and Uncle was not worthy of the comment Peter made to his Uncle about don't try to be my father. The writers could have thought of a much more noble reason for ""OUR HERO"",Spider-man, to seek revenge. Disrespecting people in authority is rampant in this country amongst our youth, and portraying Peter Parker as having this same disrespectful attitude was unnecessary. Aside from that issue, the storyline as a whole was lame. It was lacking in creativity and villians. Since the end of the movie was inviting to a sequel, my suggestion is to start the team of writers brainstorming now, so that Spidey II doesn't come across as being written in a day."
2,Boring and overrated,"If you did not have spiderman poster at your bedroom when you were kid, you simply do not have good reason to love this movie.Sam Raimi had big budget, some reasonable actors (McGuire, Dunst and Defoe), cult superhero comic book as script base, but he created an absolute failure. Plot is laughable and very childish, characters are unbelievable and what is most important, it lacks any kind of special graphic novel ""environment"". Instead it is just boring teenage action movie. However, as it had huge success among critics and in box office, producers probably decided that there is no need for any improvement and made even worse one - Daredevil. I bet Spiderman 2 will not be any better, so I suggest to forget about franchise and enjoy GOOD comic book adaptations like - BATMAN,X-MEN or BLADE."
4,From A Long-time Spidey fan,"I'm really looking forward to this big-screen version of my favourite comic - I've been reading all the Spidey titles for 20 years. I think Tobey Mcguire is an excellent actor, although I'm not sure about the new-look Green Goblin...but I guess I'll get used to it. My only fear is the usual one people have when a cherished franchise recieves an adaptation into a new medium - will it capture the essence of the comics correctly? I don't know how Sam Raimi will cope with handling such a big project as this, so different to his other work, but I'm pretty confident he'll do the best job possible. Let's hope so!"
2,"Lame story, lame special effects, lame acting","Oh boy, I was such a huge Spiderman fan when I was a kid, so this movie came as a total disappointment. Very disappointing. Very, very. Maguire is terrible as Spiderman; he's almost like immature... The special effects are too obvious to be entertaining. Just a poorly made movie."
4,"Terrific Movie, Some issues with DVD ROM","I won't say too much about the movie, other than to say that it is my favorite of all the Superhero movies that have been made. The DVD set is terrific with ton's of great extras. However, the menus are difficult to navigate on a computer. I can't seem to click directly on a menu item. Instead, you have to move the cursor around for a while until I find just the right spot where the little hand appears. In fact, there are some options that I have just not been able to select from my computer. These problems don't crop up when watching on a TV."
3,Spider Man,"Our entire family enjoyed this movie. However, the love scene is a bit dry, and the relationships between all the characters are simply a bit sad in many cases. Some of the characters, especially Spider Man's love interest and best friend, are a bit shallow - and some of the scenes seem to attempt to prove otherwise, when the characters actions speak much louder.On a more positive note, I felt the reason for the characters transformation into Spiderman were quite interesting, the main character was enjoyable to watch as he grew with his new responsibilities. The special effects were very good, not working so hard on realistic, but instead gave the old comic book feel.Though I did enjoy the movie, I felt there was simply too much left unexplored. I believe it could have been so much better, but not bad for a one time viewing. I would recommend renting it, not purchasing it."
3,Just stick to the movie,"The movie itself is great. The problems of the gift set are, well; No.1, I think the interview of Stan Lee's is extremely lengthy and boring and I'm actually typing this very review as I can't stand watching it but couldn't turn it off as this is the first time I'm playing the dvd(and probably the last). My advice is, you have to be a die-hard Stan Lee's fan rather than Spider-man's(or other characters') in order to live thru watching the stupid interview; No.2, The litograph would have made us so much happier if it had had been autographed personally and not printed; No.3, how would the 35mm film cell be made 'collectible' if everyone gets to have the same segment of the same scene from the film? Basically, it's still OK to buy the gift set if you are not too fuzzy and not mind paying a little extra. Otherwise, just stick to the movie."
5,Spidermans The Best,"I dont want to give anything away , But if you miss out on seeing this movie you'll never forgive yourself . This is one of the best movies of its kind i've seen for a long time .You'll love it from start to finish .....You can bet money that Spiderman is here to stay . A new heros in town and i bet he'll be back again and again .I know everyone who rents this movie will end up purchasing it ."
5,Sensational comic come to life!!!!,"A trusted friend had recommended this movie with two reservations1. ""Kirsten Dunst..she was okay..pretty enough but not how I thought the Spiderman's herione should look.""and 2. ""too many computerized special effects""Wrong on both counts. Kirsten Dunst glowed and was the perfect girl next door from a dysfunctional family. She's beautiful.And the effects...my god, they were fantastic. I never once sat there thinking..oh, there they go and again -- Tobey McGuire couldn't do that...which leads me to my next compliment....Talk about perfect casting...I'm surprised Hollywood didn't cast a Backstreet Boy! McGuire was believable before and after his transformation.William Dafoe puts the StarWars IV's villain and especially the 4th Batman's villains to shame. He chewed up the scenary and spewed out a believable character.This is a movie for the whole family!!! If only the world had heros like Spiderman!!"
2,Not What I expected,I was expecting 3 disks... only received 2. Will be sending this product back. Now I need to find the correct item in time for Christmas.
3,"Good, but slow","the slow part is almost predicted, because they are just trying to introduce the main characters. Sam Raimi does a great job directing this, great camera shots. Willem Dafoe does a great job portraying the green goblin and norman osborn. Kirsten Dunst plays an alright Mary-Jane, for some reason, i wasn't too pleased with that casting call, Kirsten Dunst is a great actress, but this didn't seem like her type of role. Tobey Maguire, of course, who portrays a wonderful Peter Parker, but a shaky spider-man in the beginning, but he got better as the movie progressed. Cliff Robertson and Rosemarie Harris, who do so well as the Aunt and Uncle. Even though the Uncle Ben character is only in the movie, probably 20 minutes, you feel connected to the character.Plot seemed shaky, but good. Some script cliches and the wrestling scene was not needed aswell. It is not the best movie, but it should make comic book fans jump for joy."
2,Not very good,"I was expecting this movie to at least be OK, with all the hype and what not. However, it was not.The good: Willem Dafoe, the editor of The Bugle (forgot his name), and Dunst's legs.The bad: both the story and acting seemed extremely forced and cheesy, the special effects were laughably bad (which should be unacceptable for a movie with this high a budget), and the special effects were seemingly used JUST to be used and did not further the story or add to anything.Overall, an extremely average movie. I'm glad I rented this, as I'd be pretty PO'd to have put down $15 or more for it."
2,Not impressed,I saw the movie in the theaters and I walked out ambivalent. I wasn't sure whether to hate the movie or kind of like it. After some deliberation I realized that I was not impressed. The characters were trite and the special effects were too tried.
4,SpiderMan Review,"Spiderman to me was just a good movie.For One Thing, I could not see what the Critics saw in this movie. I mean I could have just sat at home and watched the 1970s Batman Show and get the same rush. This movie was supposed to have more action than ""Star Wars Episode II."" But all it really was, was about a guy that gets bitten by a super-spider and turns into Spiderman who is suddenly caught in a struggle between the Green Goblin the whole entire movie. Maybe I'm wrong about this movie, but for now my Rating for this Movie is:8.2 out of 10"
5,Liked the comic? You'll like the movie.,"This is a movie which follows the comic book development of the charactors with great zeal. Costumes are excellent as are the special effects. Casting is superb and one can only hope that future sequels will use the same Parker, Harry Osborn and Jamison.The story line is clear and easy to understand. You needn't be familiar with the comic book. Charactors develop naturally and can be sympathized with (or hated).Special effects are outstanding. Nothing more to be said.All in all and outstanding movie -- suitable for everyone in the family. I hope that the next movie will be equally as good.Stongly Recommended.~Paul~"
4,Spider-Man,"This movie was quite thrilling. I love to see a red, masked man swooping through skyscrapers and taxi cabs, into burning buildings and busy bridges. I also loved the fascinating battle between good and evil, and the struggle within the characters between their human and superhero personas. Very intriguing and mysterious.However, I felt the ending was kind of weak. I realize it was a lead-in to a sequel, but really, something more has to go on there. I don't want to give anything away, but those who have seen the movie might know what I'm talking about.Also, I felt the additional content was rather lacking. You have to give customers something more exciting than a few sloppy histories of comic books and commentaries on the film. I was underimpressed.But the movie was good. Quite good."
1,Wins prize for minimal plot,"I preordered this video because everyone was raving about it for months. I still can't believe how devoid of a plot, the shallowness of the characters and this untiring Yo-Yo ""webbing"" all over the city that quickly grew old. I'ld rather read the comic book!!!!!"
5,If only I were Spider-Man...,"Wow! This movie is amazing! The special effects will blow your mind! Spider-Man blends utterly thrilling action with some light comedy, drama, and even a bit of romance! It's the ultimate movie-lover's movie. I really enjoyed it a lot, and what made it even more amazing was having Kirsten Dunst play the role of Mary-Jane, the object of Peter Parker's affection. A beautiful face, and excellent talent. Tobey Maguire is also a great young actor, full of spunk and after this movie, I'm sure he's going to be a ""breakthrough"" actor, totally mainstream. I can't wait for the next few installments in the Spider-Man series with Tobey and Kirsten. This is a great movie, take the family and some friends along and enjoy!"
5,Comic movies dont get any better then this one!,I actually waited awhile to see this movie to avoid the lines. The movie is just awesome with great special effects and a nice story too. They really brought spiderman to life in this movie. I cant wait for the sequel!
1,Drivel,"Worthless big-screen updating of the classic character suffers from lousy plotting and boring execution. This waste of time has all the depth of a comic book, and succeeds only in trashing a famous character's legacy and blowing a lot of stuff up. The ending is particularly ludicrous. Count me as one who will not be in line for the sequel to this stinker."
3,Its ok...,"To tell the truth, I really expected a lot more out of this movie. When I first saw it, I liked it, but after I thought about it, this movie wasn't as good as people made it out to be. I still look forward to Spider-Man 2, but I hope that it delivers more than this one did."
4,YAY comic books!,"This was a VERY faithful adaptation of a comic book to the big screen, with a few tuneups for today's generation (the original was written going on forty years ago). That being said, it's great, it's fun, it's positive for younger and older viewers without being TOO campy. It IS a comic book. If you're expecting realism, you're not being realistic enough to consider the source. Plenty of bonus goodies with a wealth of background for all the special features fanatics. No superficial pointless plot twists, no heavy handed preachy message (although the morality lesson conveyed IS valid and tactfully done without too much browbeating), and even the sexual tension is RELATIVELY innocent for the target age group. Would it win Academy awards? Not really. Should it? Not especially. Have fun with it; that's what practically every Sam Raimi film is designed for."
1,Wish I could have the option to give out negative stars...,"I see that most people loved this movie, I have a feeling thats because everything thats come to the movie theatres in recent times has just [disappointed]. Personally though I thought the acting, direction, and even the action was just boring and predictable. Give me Indiana Jones or the first Batman movie any day over this horrible excuse for a movie. Spiderman deserved so much more, but I guess Marvel was so broke they just couldn't deny the studio from releasing the film, sad... Final Thoughts: Bad, Awful and [horrible]"
5,Oh yea.,"Even though this movie doesn't come to theaters until the middle of next year, I am already going to say that this movie is going to kick some serious behind. If the movie uses the same effects and camera angles as is shown in the preview, than the world is in for an adventure like no other. It's Spider-man for crying out loud. He is the best superhero ever. On May 3, 2002, I am going to be the first in line to experience this gem of a movie. Hope to see you there"
1,Are you kiddin me?,"This is on the bottom of my list of movies along with Harry Potter and A.I. I went to all of these movies expecting something awesome but they all [were bad]. I am a huge fan of the comic book and I waited so long for the movie to come out, when i saw it, i couldn't believe how bad it was. I hated it. They critics went so easy on it. Kirsten Dunst made a horrible Mary-Jane. Todey McGuire was a pretty good Peter Parker but [wasn't good] as Spider-Man. This movie was a joke. P.S. The Green Goblin's costume was retarted and it [was bad]. Make it like the comic book. P.S.S. I hope the Hulk isn't this bad"
2,Overrated,"I saw this with my 5 year old godchild. I am 29,not really a SM fan, but with all the hype I figured I would take my godchild to see it since he likes SM. I found it boring, and the action scenes were nothing special. It was such a ripoff of Superman that it was so predictable.I was actually rooting for The Green Goblin. I was very dissapointed in this venture. I hope this is it and not a umpteen of SM movies after this one. Tobey if you are reading this, take acting lessons..."
1,For kids and comic book fans only,"Hollywood blockbusters just ain't what they used to be, but what is? It should be no surprise then that the at-long-last big-screen story of Peter Parker and his alter ego would be a letdown. Some of the special effects are as bad as those seen in ""The Hulk,"" and that's saying something. What's worse, the filmmakers seem to have banked their film's success on those FX, with the plot of this 2-hour film otherwise as flimsy as, well, a spider's web, and with just as many holes. Meanwhile Tobey Maguire goes through practically every scene with the exact same goofy, clueless expression on his very uninspiring face. Kirsten Dunst does well as MJ, but Willem Dafoe, bless his heart, is laughably bad in the role of the Green Goblin. His costume is even worse.Spiderman 2? I believe I'll pass."
5,AMAZING SPIDER-MAN!,"This is a spectacular movie. The special effects are kind of cheesy, but it is still a good movie. It's better than Superman and Batman! This is a must see movie. It's about a boy named Peter Parker (school nerd) who has a crush on Mary-Jane (school babe) and gets bit by a radio active spider and obtains really cool super powers and fights a villian named The Green Goblin who in reality is the father of Peter's only friend. You must see this. Some people will try to tell you that this is a joke, but it isn't. Although the venom (even of a radio active spider) couldn't effect the DNA of the person in anyway. You must see this today!"
5,One of the best movies of the year....,"This movie is amazing, and the DVD is even better! I never read comic books, or really cared to listen about Spiderman, and a LOVED this movie! It has all the makings of a great movie: action, drama, romance, and a great cliffhanger. The plot is amazing, the speacial effects are awesome, and surprisingly, there's very little blood, and no gore. The DVD has great extras, like commentaries and actor profiles. The second disc was really informative. It was all about the comic-book Spiderman, and it gave great backround information, especially for someone like me who has never read Spiderman before. All around, this DVD is worth the buy, so get it!"
4,"Beautiful language, beautiful thoughts.","As a pre-med student, this book caught my interest because of its focus on the side of medicine that is internal to the physician: the medicine that works in a physician's heart and mind. Campo gives a poetic and well-constructed testimony of his struggles and triumphs in reconciling his personality with the world around him and the difference between simply wanting to practice medicine and having a ""desire to heal."" I definitely recommend this to anyone with an intense desire to see the humanity of a field that is so often seen as something sterile and impersonal."

1,I've seen the movies already,This book gives a synopsis of all David Lean movies. It is useless unless someone needs to know about movies they have not seen. I wanted to read about behind-the-scenes activities in each of his movies and was chagrined when I looked over this book. I waited too long to return it so all I can do is warn others: buyer beware.
5,Meat twine,"Good, Good, Good!! Nice sturdy stuff. Cutter and spool are good quality. I don't have to handle the spool any more either so no cross contamination."
3,Concept is great - twine is poor,"Pull on the twine while tying knots and it often breaks. It seems inconsistent for strength. I love the cutter/holder --- that part is terrific. But the twine is disappointing, especially at this price."
2,The holder does not stay attached to the base,"I was disappointed in this Cooking twine holder. I do not like that the assembly does not stay attached to the base. I notice that there are tiny marks and teeth that should grab the base to keep it in place, but it does not. I have tried to place a large amount of pressure to secure it to the base to no avail. I thought the entire assembly would be attached already just like a paper towel holder. It is not."
4,Handy,"If you need to tie a lot of things up, this is worth getting. The cutter makes it especially handy to use when your other hand is holding onto the item being tied."
1,Totally dissatisfied,The sheets were way too small and very thin. I cannot use them. I haven't had time to send them back or even answer this email till now. I've always been so satisfied with the products I've bought on Amazon. I'm not used to having to send anything back. I don't think I have the packing slip or anything any more. I was just going to keep them and use them for rags or something. You win some; you lose some.
1,Not worth the money,"They are soft, however they shrink terribly even having used the low setting on the dryer. The pillow case seams do not line up with the pillow, in fact it was so bad I have replaced them.I wouldn't bother!"
3,Soft and comfortable,These sheets are soft and comfortable and great to sleep on.I did find that they shrunk quite a bit in the laundry.
3,Comfort but Golden color more than khaki,"My first jersey sheets. Not as refined as percale, but just as comfortable in cooler season when flannel might be too warm."
1,Worst sheets ever,"I mistakenly didn't read the above reviews, and purchased them. They are TOTAL JUNK. I returned them for a refund. Don't waste your time - they are see through, and stretch like a rubber band. What junk!"
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!,"I thought I was receiving good quality sheets, should of known. These are horrible sheets. They are super thin, I can see my mattress pad right through them and they don't even fit my mattress. I thought I had received the wrong size, but it said queen. What a complete waste! HORRIBLE!"
1,Disappointing,"What a disappointment! I purchased this sheet set believing it was a quality item, as it ""retails"" for $112. I have purchased jersey sheet sets previously, and have been very pleased with the quality and fit. However, this set is completely useless. The fabric itself is quite sheer; I literally could see my hand through the fabric. After washing, I attempted to put the sheets on the bed. The corner seams of the fitted sheet did not accommodate a deep mattress (unusual for bedsheets these days), and the top sheet was neither square, nor of sufficient size to allow overhang. It barely covered the top of the mattress. I was unable to tuck in the sheet at the bottom of the bed. I am VERY disappointed in what was advertised as high quality. I, too, will be trying to return them."
2,"Soft, nice, but not really worth the price","I bought these sheets because they were on sale at Amazon. They are soft, a pretty yellow, and nice to sleep in. However, the sizing is way off. I bought the queen size sheets, and it was very short and would not fit well over queen size mattress. I am currently using it on my twin size mattress (it actually fits pretty well, a little baggy) because I didn't want to go through the hassle of a return. These were inexpensive, but here I don't think I even got what I paid for - a queen size sheet set. If you are sheet hunting, I would not recommend that you purchase these. On a side note, for the sale price at Amazon (I think around $20) you can get better quality jersey that fits well at Target. And if you didn't like it, returns would be easier than at Amazon. Just a thought."
2,Poor Quality,"I received this sheet set thinking that it would be a decent quality since it retails for $112.00, however, when I opened it up, the sheets, soft as they were, were quite thin. Also, when I went to put it on my bed, the pillowcases were not hemmed right. One of them only had one side hem and when I tried to straighten the case, it was crooked and when placed on the pillow, had both top corners which are normally on the side of the pillow, in the front and back. The other pillow case was hemmed on both sides as it should have been, but when put on the pillow, was still crooked as the first one. I have another jersey sheet set and I am aware of how they are to fit on the pillows and mattresses. I am in the process of returning this set."
1,If it sounds too good to be true...,"then it usually is! That's the lesson I learned today when I received these sheets. I tossed them into the washer before using them. When they came out of the dryer, only the pillowcases were the same size as before they went in. The top sheet and fitted sheet were just about big enough for a twin bed.This is really a disappointment! I've purchased knit sheets in the past and they were good quality, which is what persuaded me to purchase these. They were listed as originally retailing at over $100, so I expected better quality.On the other hand, they did wash up beautifully, very soft, just like the ""favorite t-shirt"" that the package promised, in spite of the shrinkage."
2,Don't buy,"Bad deal. Came with a pillow case mis-sown, shrunk after the intial wash and faded rapidly. I have had Jersey knit sheets before and loved them, but these were not worth the $10 I paid for them. They are now used to cover things or for other random-sheet needs, but not for my bed."
1,Incorrect size & very poor quality,"I purchased these sheets last year thinking they were a good deal and put the package away unopened as I had plenty of sets at the time. When I finally opened them last month I found, like other reviewers, that they are not the correct size and are of very poor quality. Lesson learned to always check sheets as soon as they arrive and to stay far away from the Royal Heritage brand."
1,A Sham of a sham...,"And the sheets suck, too. Ok. I was trying to be clever, but these sheets are of terrible quality. I opened one of the three sets that I ordered and have since returned the other two. I bought them because they were a ""featured item"" on my main page here at Amazon, and I thought they would be a nice change of pace. I was wrong. I have had good jersey sheets in the past. I bought them at one of those big, box retailers for less than these sheets, and I loved them. These were ill-fitting and so thin and ""porous"" that I could feel the surface of the matress through them. Stay away! Now, if Amazon would just process my return..."
1,Why do they sell these?,Horrible. The seams were crooked. The queen size we ordered wouldn't fit on a twin mattress. You could see through them. I guess what do you expect for $20. What I don't understand is why Amazon continues to sell things that get this horrible of reviews and is consistently returned by buyers. I would have given it 0 stars if this were a choice.
2,Deceptive color & pricing,"I thought that 19.99 was a great deal for a set of jersey sheets retailing for 100+. However, upon further research, I realized that jersey sheets retail for around that price at regular b&m; (bricks and mortar) stores.My main problem with these sheets is that the color described - khaki - is actually a mustard yellow color. It's not in my opinion flattering AT ALL. Therefore, this is going back.I gave it 2 starts because the fabric did feel soft and stretchy although I don't think it was hemmed too well."
2,"Poor sheets, look somewhere else.","I've read lots of reviews and customer comments when shopping for different items online. The one thing that I find the most annoying is the buyer who seems to have a unique problem and posts comments slamming the product when the solution was truely outside the scope of the purchased item. Okay, all this lead in to say that these sheet are not very good. They are quite thin and do not fit well on the mattress size they are intended for. I wouldn't buy them again, I know they were not expensive, but even so, the quality is very low. Hope this helps you out!"
1,Poor quality.,"I too thought that these would be a good set for the price, When we tried to put the fitted sheet on the bed it was like a bad commercial, you put one corner on, the opposite would pop off, again and again and again.They would not fit.These are also very thin. The box said that they would feel like sleeping in your favorite soft tee shirt, yup, my thin 5 year old tee shirt that are in the rag pile! The pillow cases were hemmed wrong too.. Hey ours were Ugly Mustard Yellow too. I wouldn't even try to sell these at a yard sale! These are on their way back to Amazon."
2,Cozy if they fit right...,"They are a lot thinner than the Hanes brand jersey sheets I purchased a couple years back, but would be cozy...if they fit right. Most nights they pop off the bed, the cover sheet can't cover two properly, and the get all stretchy and bunched in the middle. I don't believe for a second that these sheet retailed for $100-something...the quality is mediocre at best. I'm disappointed that I bought two sets."
3,Sheets a little thin,"The sheets are a little thinner than other jersey sheets sets I've bought in the past, but overall, not bad for the price. You get what you pay for."
1,Not what I hoped for,I found these sheets to be rough. They shrank after I washed them per instructions. They were like other $19 sheets I have bought even though they were supposedly valued at a much higher cost.
5,Confortable bedding,My wife and I love these sheets. Our house has high ceilings and hence does not do too well in the winter. These sheets are the favorites for that weather as they are always warm and not freezing like others.
1,Sleazy Sheets,"Do not be fooled by what is listed as a high original price. These sheets are not worth even the low sale price. The knit of the fibers is large and loose, the stiching on the seams is large and coming out in places, and they just don't seem like they'd last through more than five washings. I sent back the two sets I ordered despite having to pay $14 to FEDEX them and also then was charged for the original shipping by Amazon because my complaint ""is not their fault""."
1,poor,"Sheet had a brown spot on it, appeared to be sown in the fabric couldn't get it out had to throw sheet away"
1,CHEAP GARBAGE!,"DO NOT BUY THESE! They are cheaply made and ill-fitting. I don't know WHAT kind of bed they would fit. I bought the the twin size, and the fitten sheet is not even close -- too wide on the narrow end, and too short on the long side! The flat sheet and pillow case won't even fold squarely. What a waste of money! Shame on you, Amazon. Listen to your customers' feedback ... like I should have done!"
1,Waste on money,i agree these sheets are horrible.. i should have know better.. I have the same issues as every one else does.. I dont know what will happen after the second wash.. They will proably fit the crib..Dont waste your money.
1,Jersey Knit Sheet Set,"These sheets are horrible, the weight is extremely light. They were supposed to be queen size, but did not fit my bed. Additionally, when I tried to put them on my bed, I poked a hole through the fitted sheet with my finger. They'll be used for dusting perhaps."
1,Don't Buy!!!,"I bought these sheets and I am very disappointed. Sheet doesn't fit bed, it doesn't cover the sides of the mattress. The pillowcases are irregular and the seams don't even match."
1,"Scratchy, Ill-fitting Sheets","Neither the fitted sheet, flat sheet nor pillow case fit properly...Way too small or uneven. Plus the fabric is very scratchy to the skin. Save your money."
1,Very poor quality,I bought these sheets and not only are they paper thin and poor quality but they do not fit my bed at all. Do not waste your time on these...
1,Better off buying something else,"These sheets are too small for our bed as well. I would buy a size bigger if you can. They are very poorly made though and not a good quality i bought 2 sets and one was sewn diagonally down the pillowcases,so i sent it back, they other one i ended up putting on my daughters full bed. You can find better sheets, i would not buy these again."
1,Poor Quality,I am very unhappy with this purchase. The fabric is very thin and after the first use the sheets were full of pills and looked liked they had been used for years instead of one week.
1,Not woth the money!,"They are soft, however they shrink terribly even having used the low setting on the dryer. The pillow case seams do not line up with the pillow, in fact it was so bad I have replaced them.I wouldn't bother!"
3,..,"the sheets themselves are fine, im just a little irritated that i was sent THE WRONG SIZE! other then than, they are nice."
1,Bad Quality,"Same problem with my queen set. After washing them before use, the fitted sheet was smaller than a queen size bed. The colors after the wash also faded causing a nonmatching color set. If you wanna try Jersey Knit, shop at a local store where returns are easier."
2,"The top sheet is great, but...","Trying to put on the bottom sheet nearly put my back out. It wasn't until I measured that I realized that I had been sent a Full top sheet and a TWIN bottom sheet that is labeled ""Full"".It wasn't worth the time or postage to return the sheets, so I gave them to someone with a twin bed.The top sheet, which I did use once since I was making the bed and had PLANNED on using this set, is soft and warm and comfy. If you buy these sheets, keep that in mind - but measure before you try to put them on your bed. If you have the time and energy, you can return yours if YOU get the wrong order."
1,Returned without accepting from UPS,"Unfortunately I ordered these sheets before reading the reviews. Within 1/2 hr. of ordering & after reading the reviews which convinced me the merchandise was not worth receiving I could not cancel because it was already being processed. I called Customer Service & the service rep. was so nice & helpful in telling me not to accept delivery - just refuse the package. I guess when I saw the price for the sheets I should have known if it sounded too good to be true it was. Thanks everyone for your comments & reviews so I didn't get 'stuck' with sheets that wouldn't fit, shrunk to unusable size & inferior material. Next time I'll read the reviews FIRST."
1,Suck,I brought three sets of these sheets and I must agree with everyone else that after I washed them they were no good. I now use them to clean my car and mirrors. There were only good reviews when I ordered. I will never order sheets from here again. WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY.
4,cozy,Great for cold nights. We bought for a guest room and we can keep heat down while guests are warm.
4,Like a T-Shirt,These sheets are nice and soft like a favorite t-shirt. They wash well and fit the mattress tightly so they don't come off with movement. I would recommend it for colder months of the year when you want more warmth.
2,Pretty mint colour ......,The colour is pretty but the sheets shrink quite a lot after washing (in cold water). I bought a queen set for a full bed and they still don't fit properly after careful washing . I would recommend buying a KING set for a full bed. This was my first experience with cotton jersey sheets so I didn't know what to expect but I wouldn't buy them again.
3,LIMITED OVERALL COVERAGE...,"This is not such a bad dvd, except (1) it's not done in English. (2) not enough world tournament coverage.., i.e -- world cup games highlighting these talents. (3) most of the coverage of these players are about their club affiliations in major Italian soccer leagues..., which is alright, kinda ---- except why just all about the Italian clubs ?! Overall, it was just too limited and concentrated on too much of a particular level of soccer, and not more or enough depth with even other and more Brazilian players. It was good to see mention of Batistuta, though none of Bebeto. So..., you be the judge...!!"
3,Chantal teakettle,"We had the Chantal teakettle for over 12 years, cobalt blue. It never got daily use, but looked great on our Viking range. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that my wife was shocked to look inside the rim, and it was totally rusted all around the inside top. It still looked perfect on the outside, no nicks or scratches. The whistle worked, heated quickly, was great all those years. Not sure why the rust except that we sometimes let water sit in the kettle. We hated throwing it in the trash. Purchased the Le Creseut teakettle yesterday. Its more of a kettle than we need, but seems even sturdier. Instructions said not to let water stand in the pot. Corningware used to make a small, cermaic kettle -loved that one."
3,In spite of its shortcomings....,"This is my third kettle. The first and second were dropped and badly damaged. The first one lasted years before it had to be replaced. The second and third ones were relatively young. The current one does not whistle and it's only two years old. The aesthetic appeal and the capacity of this kettle cancels out its shortcomings. The handle gets very hot. A potholder or the handle cover that comes with the kettle is necessary. A pot holder or the handle cover makes picking up the kettle awkward. The inside of the lid scratches off the enamel, and the whistle finally goes."
2,Wanted to like it....,"I've had two. Same hassles on both: handle will burn you; use a mitt or potholder. Which is a nuisance. They are easy to overfill, leading to boil overs, which can kill the flame, but leave the gas going if you aren't there to watch it. Again-- annoying, plus a safety risk. As others have noted- the lid can be difficult to remove. Finally, it leaks at the joint where the metal tip on spout screws onto the tea kettle. I wanted to love this product, but it is cantankerous, and not in a good way. Avoid, unless you like a fuss and a sense of accomplishment from performing a difficult task (boiling water) that should have been simple."
4,A lot of tea,"This is a great tea kettle. We already have one and gave this as a gift because our friend admired ours so much. Wow, is it expensive! I'm still not sure if it is all that and a cup tea."
3,More solid than practical,"I like the look and the feel of the kettle. However, the bottom is a bit too small for a standard large electric burner and thus I put it on the small burner to heat and this takes way too long. My handle didn't get hot though (only slightly warm) like the earlier reviewer's kettle."
3,NOT SO CRAZY ABOUT CHANTEL,"I found this tea kettle to be fast, but the handle got too hot. When I used the hot pad to handle it the steam from the not so Secure cover burned my fingers. At this price this should be a better products"
1,Just not worth it.,I paid about a hundren bucks for a beautiful kettle that was suposed to last for years. Two months later the lid became unglued. It took forever to get a replacement part as I was shuffled from person to person. Chantal would not replace it I had to go through the store. Fine. It was replaced. I was once again happy with my cute little kettle. A year later the enamel coating inside the teakettle has all but completely flaked off. I take excellend care of the kettle. Really it was a splurge for me and what a dissapointment it turned out to be.I'm now afraid of I've injested a toxic lining. At any rate Chantal has never replied to my request to find out what compound I subjected my family to. It's just scary and they've been no help at all.Do yourself a favor and by a cheaper safer version even if it doesn't look as pretty.
5,Fabulous Tea Kettle,"I have had my beautiful Chantal Tea Kettle for several years know. It is as pretty as the day I got it and I love it. The whitstle is wonderful, the kettle is so sturdy and the cobalt blue matches my kitchen accents. It is the best tea kettle I have ever owned and worth the price."
1,Worst Design Ever,"This is the worst designed tea kettle I have ever owned! Note that the handle is metal - that means it gets HOT! So when you are ready to pour, make sure you have a big oven glove on. Note that the lid is under the handle (and also metal so also HOT!). It is a challenge to open the lid at all given its location under the handle, even more of a challenge when both pieces are very hot. Also, to pour, you need to open the metal spout cover (also HOT!). So I give it a star for attractiveness, and yes it is so sturdy, I have yet to replace it, but I would not recommend this particular model."
4,This is my fifth chantel,"Yes, this is my 5th, and it's not Chantel's fault! I kept burning them over and over again. I tend to put the kettle on, paddle back to my bedroom and b4 I know it, I felt asleep, only to wake up the next morning to find that I burnt the kettle again! No kettle can withstand such abuse over and over again, except a Chantel!(I tried it with cheaper version, and it was usually done with after one burning!) That is why I keep buying a Chantel. I like the enemal-on-steel idea because the hot water will not be tainted with a taste of steel. My complaint is that Chantel took away a lot of the lovely colors, limiting the choice of color to a handful."
3,Pretty but Poorly Conceived,"The kettle's form is beautiful. It's by far the most attractive everyday kettle I've come across.However, I think the kettle is designed poorly, especially considering the somewhat hefty price tag.Notes: 1.) The metal handle (directly in the line of steam) gets very, very hot. A thick potholder or oven mit is a necessity when pouring tea.2.) The multi-tone whistle, while harmonic, is a bit shrill.3.) The water boils almost instantly. Stay close to the stove.This kettle is ideally suited to someone who needs to boil water incredibly quickly; likes aesthetically pleasing kitchen tools; and doesn't mind loud whistles, pot holders, or an above-average price tag."
2,tea kettle,"This kettle is very nice looking. But, the handle gets BURNING HOT! and it takes a very long time to heat the water because of the small bottom surface. Not very practical."
2,Flimsy and quiet; not what it used to be,"I'm very unhappy with this product compared to the (allegedly) same product I bought literally decades ago. I recycled the old one (and on second thought wish I hadn't) because I felt I'd left it one too many times on the burner without any water in it; also, it looked very scuzzy inside. I knew as soon as I lifted the new one out of the box that it was much more cheaply made. It feels lighter and just doesn't look or feel as solid or well constructed. All of that wouldn't matter much if it worked OK, but it doesn't. I can barely (and sometimes not at all) hear the whistle from the next room; my hearing is fine but I really liked the loudness and beautiful two-tone, train-like whistle on my old teakettle. I called the company and they very graciously sent me a new whistle, but that hasn't solved the problem and I'm probably going to just give up. I think that, once again, ""They just don't make them like they use to!"""
2,Disappointed a year later,"Unfortunately, I hoped against hope that maybe some of these reviewers were mis-treating their teakettles and mine would be fine. I got this for my wife for Christmas, and it only took a year for the whistle to literally rust apart and break. The kettle still works fine, but the pleasing whistle is gone. I expect a lot more from a product at this price point. My Oxo kettle this replaced gave years of good service and I only retired it because I wanted something that looked nicer than the Oxo. Big mistake. There is also visible corrosion on the hinge for the tea kettle. We baby this thing, so there really is no excuse for it wearing so horribly. A tea kettle should be able to withstand water and heat over repeated exposures. That's its job. Unfortunately, this one isn't up to the task."
3,Hurt and disappointed,"My original Chantal finally gave up the ghost. It devleoped a small leak from as the bottom decomposed. Unfazed, I ordered a new one as I am totally enamored with the product. However when I fired up the new kettle, the lid leaked so much that whistle didn' work. So I returned it to Amazon for another one. This one has the same problem. I am going to contact the manufacurer and find out what can be done. I will add to this review at that time. Keep the faith, these are great devices when they work properly."
1,Not the product it used to be...,I had a Chantal Teakettle for over 20 years. Bought it when they 1st came out with the Hohner whistle...Gave the original one to my daughter & it is still working perfectly.Bought this one for a color change. It is rarely used. More of a decoration on the stove & a way to cover hot burners.Less than a year from purchase & being used less than 10 times...the whistle part flew off.Contacted Chantal. They will replace it...for $15...because things happen & things wear out. After 6 uses???I don't know if it's because they are made in Thailand & China now...but this is NOT the same teakettle I used & loved.Definitely not worth the money now.
1,whistle didn't work on first day!,"I received the tea kettle today. It made a quiet tone (not loud enough to hear in another room) the first time I used it. The second time I used it, it boiled for a long time with no sound whatsoever. I am returning it. No one seems to have mentioned that it's impossible to hold it by the handle and open the spout with the same hand. I do have small hands, but not any smaller than lots of women and it's not even close. I doubt even someone with large hands could do it. Shouldn't you be able to use a tea kettle with one hand?It does look very nice, but isn't worth $20 in my opinion, and definitely not worth the $100 I paid for it."
3,Very rusty interior,"I was surprised to find out that the Chantal tea kettle does NOT last a lifetime! I hadn't inspected the interior for a while, but when I did, I discovered that it was covered with rust. I am disappointed to have to throw it out. It did, however, last quite a few years."
1,Long Time Former Chantal Fan,"I was a huge Chantal fan 20 years ago, and I have owned two Chantal tea kettles. Like a previous reviewer, I owned my first a long time; I purchased it 17 years ago. When my daughter went off to college three years ago, I gave it to her as I wanted a new color; she is still using the old one and loving it. The new one doesn't hold a candle to the old one; the whistle doesn't work properly, and after two years the handle on the lid came off. I tried to have a friend who is an expert welder weld it back on - no good. I contacted Chantal and they were useless - asked me to purchase a new lid which I would not do as I had already had issues with a pan handle coming off and they couldn't repair or replace it. It is obvious that the workmanship of this very expensive kettle is not what it used to be. Buy something else if this will be anything but a stove top decoration."
4,Horse Owner's Must-Have,This book should be in every horse owner's library. The illustrations are descriptive and very useful. The book does require you have a good working knowledge of the equine foot and states so in the book. I've learned so much about equine feet from this book.
5,Great book about natural hoof care.,"Our farrier recommended this book for us to read. My daughter leases a horse that foundered and fortunatly it was caught fairly early but she still had hoof issues. The farrier wanted to continue her barefoot and told us that this book would explain why. I have to say that the book is an easy read and the explaination was great. Our Bella is doing fine and I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to ""go natural"". It is working for us and our horse."
2,Founder - Hope At Last!,"A lucid, logical presentation on the prevention and cure for founder accompanied by many excellent photos which exemplify the principles discussed. After only a few weeks days of applying these priciples, my horse and I are riding the trails again."
2,"nice presentatio, but spins poorly","Sorry to say this, but for a little more money you could get a vintage brass Put & Take that spins easily and nicely virtually every time with little effort. This one is quite frustrating. Once you get the knack, you can make several successful spins in a row, but then you have trouble. It seems that a good half the time it does not spin well -- it flops around like dice. ... ...... I collect Put & Takes, and like having this in my collection. The booklet is a nice touch. The 13 metal silvery ""Pieces of Eight"" and golden ""Doubloons"" are a hoot."
2,"Not as pictured, but still nice","Be forewarned, this toy does not come as pictured. It only comes with the small bag, spinning top, coins and instructions.As I only wanted the coins really, I can't find too much fault them."
3,The Martha books (little house series),"Beautifully written (like all little house books, even though this one is not by Laura). The Martha years are the first set of books in the little house series, Martha is Laura Ingalls great grandmother. If you enjoyed the Laura books then you will also like reading about Martha, the author has done a great job creating a charachter suited to be Laura Ingalls great grandmother, her telling of Martha's childhood in Scotland before the American Pioneer years was both fun and interesting to read."
2,Dated.,"Back when I first bought this, I would have given it 4 stars but like a lot of artists did during that decade, they opted for a ""modern"" sound which is fine--for that time. Now I don't listen to it at all. ""Stages"" and ""Delirious"" are still good, but on the rest of the songs the pounding electronic rythms and synthesizers drown everything else out. Their earlier albums hold up better because they don't use as much studio B.S. to flesh their songs out."
3,Not the best,"This album is has really mixed results. There are a few good tunes such as Sleeping Bag, Dipping Low, Rough Boy and Planet of Women is pretty decent. Other than that, the album is pretty mediocre. It lacks the Fire Eliminator had. It just gets more watered down and pop here.The sad part is that Dipping Low one of it's top three songs on the album is pretty much just Gimme All Your Lovin' with different lyrics. I'd guess they would have expected that one to be a hit. With only 4 decent tracks, this album pretty much isn't that good.In final, the album suffers from watered down songs. Just download the mentioned songs from Itunes and forget the rest."
2,Eliminator Lite,"The boys from Texas followed up their smash album ""Eliminator"" with a similar sounding album that features far fewer good songs. The burner ""Sleeping Bag"" opens things well enough, but it is not until you get to track four and the ballad ""Rough Boy"" that you get another first rate song. Of the rest, only the ready made dance hit ""Velcro Fly"" makes any impression. It is probably no accident that after this album, ZZ Top turned back in a more blues oriented direction that defined them in the 70s."
3,An 80s Classic That Hasn't Aged Well,"I was in junior high when this album came out, and I played my cassette copy to death back then. I thought the song ""Stages"" was the coolest song I had ever heard. I recently bought the CD after not listening to the album in over 10 years. As much as I loved it in 1985, the music has not aged well at all. The heavy synthesized sound that was great back then sounds uninteresting and bland today. However, the CD does bring back a lot of memories. If you grew up during the 80s and want to return to those days (at least in spirit), go ahead and pick this up. Otherwise, don't bother."
1,[real low point],"This is a real low point in ZZ Top's catalog. Eliminator was decent, though the music was buried under layers of synthesizers and drum tracks. But still, Gimme All Your Lovin' and Sharp Dressed Man were good rockers. However, on Afterburner, ZZ Top simply forgets that they are a rock band. There is almost no guitar here. It's just keyboards and fake drums. Absolute garbage! This is a disgrace, especially when compared to the group's excellent works, Tres Hombres and Deguello.Avoid this album at all costs."
1,ME OL ME OL MY,there really good i love the music but they need to shave im just asking amazon books and zztop rules
3,"Very Glittery, Beautiful Bracelet","The bracelet is very beautiful. Very glittery, the stones are just awesome. Bracelet a little big even for my big wrist. The gold is very, very yellow making the bracelet look more costume than the picture shows. I expected it to be more authentic."
2,Poorly Written,"My husband and I both agree that this book has some fascinating facts; however, it is poorly written, making it difficult to follow. The author jumps from synopsis to synopsis of documents with little or no transitions. Sometimes the events in a single relic's story aren't even in chronological order."
5,Careful scholarship,"Careful scholarship and photos help the reader see and marvel at the relics left for our edification. The author does not exclude mentioning areas where the authenticity of relics are questioned with the passage of time, helping the reader to get a clear picture of their importance and a sure barometer of their genuineness."
5,Excellent,Received the book promptly and in excellent condition. Would order from this seller again without hesitation.
3,Catholic centered,"Looking for books on relics and reliquaries, this was one of the few around. It is definitively Catholic centered in content and Catholic based in perspective. To that end it has a lot of information and acts like a pseudo encyclopedia. I was hoping for more broad cross cultural discussion, but for what it is it is pretty good, albeit a bit light on the subject."
5,"Above average quality rotating self, easy to install.","Installed in a corner kitchen cabinet and it works great. The shelf is high quality. The rotating shelf have metal hubs with bushings and the plastic has molded in gussets for heavy loads. Installation was easy. My cabinets are 42"" tall outside so I trimmed the shaft down (with a pipe cutter) to make installing the shelf easier."
1,Useless & Vague,"The information in the book is so vague that you learn nothing about the topics. The book seems to be more of an advertisement for websites, sofware etc. A short and useless read."
1,Useless,The content of this book is useless. You can find this information in Stock and Commodities or Futures
1,Very poor content,Do not waste your time reading this book. You can find this kind of information on the internet !
3,"Borrow, don't buy","I do like this book--but I didn't realize it was so small! There are hardly any pages at all! Great concept and interesting images, good to look through, but not worth $12. I wish I would have read the description better before I purchased."
3,Not as good as I had thought,"I was a bit disappointed in this book. I loved that the children were encouraged to write about a part of themselves they were particularly proud of, however, many of the entries weren't especially notable. My favorite was the last one about the girl's hands. That was exquisite!"
2,Not a great album,"Always the same thing with soundtrack albums, I keep them for 2-3 songs only.This one is kept for ""N'sel fik"", one the best algerian song I ever heard. Also kept for ""Downtown"" by Lloyd Cole a magnificiant harmonica song (my favorite from him).Can't stand all of Skinny puppy's songs and this one is no execption."
3,misleading,Enjoyed the story but from the description it says that the book is over two hundred pages and in reality this story is less than thirty pages
3,A fairly good book,This book does provide the reader with a basic insight of Lucianos life.It has been well written but the facts seem to be a bit out of place.A few incidents seem to be exagerated by the author and the reader gets the feeling that its not a book but more like a story from the news paper. A good book for a reader who wants to have basic knowledge of Lucianos life but the book i would recommend for the true followers of Organized crime is the Luciano Testament.
2,Book does not flow,"This book is a great introduction, but nothing more. The book has no continuous flow to it. It is not well written, but does contain some useful information into the power that Luciano held"
5,Good collection of early Ska,"Bought this cd after seeing the good movie 'Scandal' ... if you like early ska, it's hard not to appreciate this collection!"
2,"Confusing plot, actors mumble","There was something satisfying about the way the main character kept offing those who had killed his heart donor. But most of the time it was difficult to figure the story, and we were painfully aware that all the actors (but most particularly the female doctor who was the love interest), kept swallowing their words so that none of us could hear what was said. Regarding the confusing plot, one of the people with whom I was watching is a cardiologist - well, all of us are certified to be quite intelligent and experienced watchers of art flicks.... I think by the end we understood where the story was headed but were definitely underwhelmed.BTW, this Blu-ray DVD apparently lacks subtitles. We looked for those, as they might have helped us understand the mumbled lines."
1,Tell tale,"Product was damaged. I had to purchase it again. I was about to show it to the class, and when I opened it, it was cracked. I was stuck and had to scramble. We had just finished reading Poe's story and they had written their own adaptation of the Tell Tale Heart. I purchased it again."
3,Tell Tale,"Good spin off of Edgar Allan Poe's ""Tell Tale Heart"", a semi-original movie that is not like many others. This was a decent suspense movie that was interesting throughout with a twist at the end. Not one of the best movies I have ever seen, but not terrible either."
3,good solid thriller,I enjoyed this movie; it kept me on the edge of my seat and the twist at the end was neat.
2,"Bad film, bad blu-ray ...","This movie is bad, and the blu-ray video quality sometimes is bad too. It looks like an excellent DVD in a few scenes and a so so DVD in most parts of it. I can't understand the people who make this things! I think they need a doctor!"
3,Movie,"I can't say that I agree with the previous reviews. It was tolerable, but I had difficulty with their speech. It is set in Ireland and they used local actors I assume? The acting was ok, no real complaints there. The movie was engaging, but some parts were just too off the wall and left me shaking my head. If it wasn't for the cow (you have to watch it to know what I mean), I think I may have liked it more. The ending left something to be desired. It was ok, for the price, you can't really go too negative."
1,Lasted 5 minutes,can't say much. turned it off after 15 minutes.cheesey and too low budget to continue. 0 stars is my actual opinion.
3,Dead What?,I had to go back & reread the synopsis to remind me what the movie was about. That's how memorable it was. This is not what I would call a keeper. It's not worth the time or money it would take to sell it back to Amazon. 2 thumbs down!
4,MAD COW,DEADMEAT STARTS OUT A MAN AND WOMAN GOT IN AN ACCIDENT ON THE ROAD HITTING SOMEONE. AFTER CHECKING TO SEE IF HE WAS ALRIGHT THE BOYFRIEND (OR HUSBAND) DESCOVERED THAT THE MAN HE HIT WAS DEAD.PUTING THE BODY IN THE BACK OF THERE CAR IT SUDDENLY CAME TO LIFE AND ATTACK THE MAN. THE MAN KILLED HIS ATTACKER (AGAIN) BUT NOT BEFORE HE WAS SERIOUSLY INJURED. HIS GIRLFRIEND (OR WIFE) THEN WENT OFF TO GET SOME HELP... FROM THIS THE MOVIE TAKES OFF AS A GOOD ZOMBIE MOVIE GOOD GORE F/X AND LOTS OF ACTION. THE ONLY REASON WHY I DIDN'T GIVE THIS MOVIE FIVE STARS IS BECAUSE THE FILM LOOKS A BIT AMATEURISH AND TOO MANY SHAKING BUT A SMALL PRICE TO PAY FOR A GOOD ZOMBIE MOVIE.
3,3.5 for this one,"OK, I got this and was like hmmmm, what will it be like, another stinker OR a gem? It was a gem. I truly liked it. It had the gore, plot, and a very decent cast. I was pleasantly surprised, since Fangoria has lead me astray before. Anyway, if you're looking for a good time ENJOY this one with your sweetie and a bloody pizza. It's totally lovely. The only thing that kept me from giving it a 4 star rating was the sudden and unexpected abrupt ending. WOO HOO, Irish zombie film, YAY!"
3,zombie cows? YOU KNOW IT!!!,"Oh yeah...zombie cows BABY! Dead Meat is about an infection with cows or something and they die come back to life and start killing people which initially causes them to become the living dead. yeah theyre technically zombies but dont run off of your typical ""destroy the brain"" zombie stereotype. one of them was killed by by getting its eye sucked up by a vacuum hose. another gets skewered through the stomach. you get the point. i dont see why so many people are uptight about this movie. there are much much worse movies out there. this isnt that bad. sure the makeup fx are on faces are crappy but oh well. and zombie cows? COME ON!!! thats awesome. that was the main reason we rented this movie. the basic fact that there are zombie cows in it. kinda reminded me of the zombie fish in Undead. altogether it was a decent flick. i wouldnt buy it but i would watch it if it was on. not bad for a rental."
2,it was not very good,"some of the movie was ok, had its funny moments, but was not very good, why can't anyone outside the united states make a decent zombie movie, maybe i just don't like the thick accents, i don't know, just not enough action, the effects suck, nothing to like about the actors, people complain about land of the dead and day of the dead the need to feed, but those movies are head and tails above this flick, bottom of the barrel movies, only watch if its free and you are desperate......"
4,gory fun,"Old school fx, at least 6 or 7 beheadings, dudes with really thick Irish accents chopping zombies up with shovels. One lady even gets eaten by a crazy cow... If you like zombie movies what more could you want?"
3,Not too bad,As far as cheaply made zombie movies go this one is not too bad. It avoids going campy or the cheap comedic nonsense that many similar movies of this type try. The special effects are not bad (although the zombie cow attack is kind of lame). It is an Irish production and they have wisely added subtitles in case the Irish brough gets too thick for you to understand. The ending is a little abrupt but overall I have to say this was a watchable movie and a notch above the usual direct to video films in the genre.
2,Dead Duck!,"Two stars for effort alone as these guys got off their backsides and just did it. Saw this at London's frightfest and was torn with a sympathetic view of the young and inexperienced filmmakers genuine efforts and what in the end was a bad film. Its poorly acted and has little in the way of new ideas, its saving grace was the addition of a totally over the top character whose dialect was so strong and incomprehensible it added to a manic performance and some genuine laughs. As always with low budget films the difference between good and bad are ideas, this sadly didn't have any. Don't be fooled by the initial reviews seen on Amazon, this isn't a gem waiting to be discovered."
1,Zombie Cows,"Ummm... yeah this movie sucked. I mean come on, zombie cows? This movie had really bad special effects, even worse acting, and most of all it was just retarted. This lady even took her high heel shoe off and threw it at a zombie and impaled its head. I know its a zombie movie and its not suppose to be realistic, but a high heel shoe? The only reason that you should rent this is because there is this short movie the director made that also sucks, but in a funny way. So, if you are super bored, go rent it and make fun of it. If you are just looking for a good zombie movie, keep looking. after watching this movie I actually think I've becaome brain dead."
5,Definitely a Pete Yorn album,"""Nightcrawler"" is a solid album revealing Pete Yorn's versatility as an artist. The album is quite relaxing and a bit cathartic. My favorite song on the album is either ""Vampyre"" or ""Splendid Isolation"" although many of the tracks are wonderful. The album is definitely worth listening to."
5,My Number One Album,"I have been a PY fan since my sister gave me ""Music For the Morning After"" (which is apparently coming out in re-release in 2011 according to PY Twitter). I love MFTMA but its this album that is always in my car CD player (despite the other twenty or so CDs in the car). And when asked to vote for the best PY song, my vote is always cast for ""Undercover"". You cannot go wrong with Pete Yorn and particularly this album!"
4,A Different Direction,"I have grown to really enjoy this album. In my opinion, a change in direction from musicforthemorningafter and Day I Forgot. I found it a little more mellow and solemn, and at the same time less acoustic than the predecessors. I do miss the acoustic portion of Pete Yorn's music on this album, with Ice Age one of the few to feature acoustic guitar. All in all, an odd first few listens, but worth grabbing for any Pete Yorn fan.A few of my favorites: Undercover, Policies, The Man, Ice AgeGeorgie Boy is probably my least favorite. Saw it in concert as well and it seems very out of place."
2,Vinyl pressing terrible,Love Pete Yorn but the vinyl version of Nightcrawler is awful. It's to low in volume and sounds compressed and muddy.Wonder if anyone else as noticed this?I also have the CD version so I played that at the same volume level as the vinyl and the sound was a lot better and a lot louder!!!.Whoever mixed this for the vinyl version should be sacked.
2,wrong direction with this album!,"I liked Pete Yorn's other releases, but this one is not that good. What I mean by that is, the best song on the album is Undercover which is a song from the Spider-Man soundtrack years ago, that was included on this album for some reason. Thank goodness it was because without it, the album would not even be worth having. I don't know what happened but this album just isn't that good compared to his first 2 albums. His other releases had some standout songs on it, this one doesn't at all. Hopefully his next release will be much better. Say maybe more like his debut album, which is still his best album to date."
5,A new very Talented musucian indeed,Pete Yorn is a talented musician and has recorded a magnificent record!
4,give it some time,"This is a pretty good album. It's still easy to identify the Pete Yorn feel in these songs. Yes, it's a bit darker, a bit more electronic at times, but it's still clearly classic Pete. I'm actually a bit impressed by some of the depth (layering) in a few of these songs. Namely, ""The Man"" and ""Maybe I'm Right"". These are two very fine songs, and ""Ice Age"" is a great great solemn song. I certainly don't feel he took a step backwards here, or even sideways. Maybe a baby step forward."
3,A technician-training level manual,"The study guide and lab manual is not written on a level suitable for most college electrical engineering courses, I believe, since it is rather mechanical in its procedures, which are of the form ""do this, measure that"" but do not require much understanding of the underlying theory. Although there are a few questions accompanying the ""procedures"" these do not probe deeply enough, in my opinion, and it would be quite possible for a student to perform the experiment and fill in all the blanks without understanding much of what s/he did. There are ""review"" sheets preceeding each experiment which touch on the theory, but again in a mechanical way. It does not seem to me that the experiments would provide any opportunity for creativity or real *experimentation* for students, and therefore the authors' goal of ""stimulating your interest in elecricity and electronics"" is unlikely to be met."
4,End of an Era,This is the final book in a trilogy and it picked up nicely where the earlier books left off. This book was the third in a trilogy about the legand of King Arthur and followed Guninevere's story to a nice conclusion (if you can call it that). The author told Guinevere's story using a modern perspective and did a nice job reconciling the Author v. Lancelot story. She presented Mordred's rebellion in a understandable way and knit the legand together in several ways. For any one interested King Arthur this is a must read.
5,Gift to grandson.,Got this for my grandson to encourage reading and also inspire vision.I was not disappointed. Good for those desiring rapid and easy reading.
2,Cheaply Bound,"Bought this as a gift for the local elementary school library. It was supposed to be the better-bound ""library edition"", but it was poorly made and won't stand up to many small fingers. You have to ask the few kids who will be able to read it for a full review."
5,Superlative,"I believe this was Previn's first recording with the London Symphony, back in 1965. This period yielded a bumper crop of fine recordings with this team, including Nielsen's First Symphony, Scheherazade, and Tchaikovsky's Second Symphony. This is as fine a Shostakovich Fifth as I have ever heard. The recording was made some years before the composer's revelation of the work's hidden program in ""Testimony."" Nevertheless, Previn's middle-of-the-road stance toward interpretive issues yields a performance that is highly compelling even in relation to what the composer had to say. And I never have heard any orchestra play better than the Londoners do on this CD. The sound engineering is demonstration class, too. Serebrier's suite from ""Hamlet"" makes an interesting fill up, with good playing and equally realistic recording. But you buy this disc for the symphony."
5,One of the best videos of this type I have ever experienced,"I have been collecting video recordings of classical music, and this is one of the best. The sound is excellent, as are the camera angles. Ozawa (unlike many conductors) does not hog the camera; one really gets a fine sense of how the music is actually made. It is an outdoor concert, but that contributes to the fun: the orchestra members smile and chuckle when, occasionally, the reaction of a child in the audience is heard. All in all a superb video; I highly recommend it."
3,Biography of James Maxwell,"I found the book easily readable and enjoyable, however focusing more on biography and light on science. I had hoped to pick up more science, especially when the bigraphy was written by an engineer. I found that my knowledge of Maxwell's contributions to science was limited before reading this book. I also found it interesting that physics was taught in his day as natural philosophy. The many details of the English universities were also quite interesting."
4,Are People People,"Some Great Reward takes the first big step towards more mature sound and lyrics. Blasphemous Rumours is one of the greatest songs crafted by DM. The breathing at the end gives an eerie feeling that would be felt during Black Celebration. Master and Servant and People are People, along with Blasphemous Rumours, are the highlights of SGR. The only flaw in SGR is that some of the tracks feel as if they were not completed. Other than that, SGR contains some of DM's finest work and my all time favorite DM song, People are People."
4,Some great music,"Following the politically motivated ""Construction time again"",SGR found Martin exploring more personal waters, while the group were expanding and experimenting more with sound. This album is a Stereo and sampling feast appreciated best with headphones, loud. Among the highlights are ""Something to do"" - a brill social statement reflecting small town angst as well as ""Blasphemous Rumours"" (quite contreversial at the time,we have come a long way since then)Also love the lyric on ""Stories of old"", simple and strong.Martin sings two songs on the album ""It doesnt matter"" being my favourite.Highly recommended for fans of old and new. A true original as only the Modes can muster."
5,Everything that is best about Depeche Mode,"It's not too often where I find an album where every single song is enjoyable and worth listening too. This album is quintessential Depeche. It has all the mood, depth, and clarity that the earlier albums showed the potential of and, alas, which the latter albums eventually lost."
3,People are People,The song that started it all with me was People are People andthe video that showcased the group.Very powerful to me.
4,The first real DM's classic!,"There are seven fine and enjoyable songs, but there are also two less good tracks. People are People is full of catchy melodies and it has important message to us all, Master and Servant is kinky classic for sadomastic persons and Blashemous Rumours is dark song with good chorus. Something to Do and Lie to Me are songs that you can forget because they just don't sit on this album. It Doesn't Matter and Somebody are beautiful and touchy loce songs. Some Great Reward is good album to start explore DM's music."
3,Not as good as the critics say,"One of the most consistently overrated of Depeche Mode's albums by the critics, Some Great Reward has little more to offer than the other two best pre-Black Celebration DM albums, Speak & Spell and Construction Time Again. While there is no question that ""Blasphemous Rumours"" is as catchy a tune as any Depeche Mode has written and one with darker, more thought provoking lyrics than almost anything else in their cannon, the highly praised ""Somebody"" is sappy, cloying dross, and ""Master and Servant"" is not nearly as essential as the critics suggest. However, there are a few very good tunes here that can't be found anywhere else. ""Something to Do,"" the sultry ""Lie to Me,"" and the confident sounding, catchy ""If You Want"" are especially good. Of the others tracks not mentioned, all are pleasantly innocuous, not adding to or taking away from the overall fine quality of the album."
2,"Dull, like Construction Time Again","I was a huge fan of DM albums like Music for the Masses, Black Celebration, and Violator. I also enjoyed People are People, some songs on Broken Frame and much of Speak and Spell. But, most of this record never did anything for me. It is rare for me to have had a tape in the 80s that I didn't really try to like from bands I liked. But, a few songs like Lie to Me are good as I recall, but People are People is a stronger ""early Mode"" post Speak and Spell choice. Stick with Music for the Masses, Violator, Black Celebration, People are People, and Speak and Spell."
3,Funny but cover photo is misleading,"You might think that this book will have something about motorcycle travel. Or, failing that, you might think it would have a funny story about some motorcycle being used to carry a sheep. Right??? That's on the cover!The stories range from mildly disturbing revelations (tapir ticks on, well, you can imagine the various appendages) to tales of frustration (bus ticket workers who pretend to not know how to speak English) to pearls of wisdom (watch where you step in desert sands).Make no mistake, it's a funny book. However, it doesn't have any stories to appeal to a motorcycle traveler. Deceptive cover photos dilute the flavor of any book, and this is no exception."
1,Do not waiste your money or time on this book,"The fact that this book is label as a humor book is very misleading since, I wasn't able to find a funny story in this book."
3,I've only been using this for the past three weeks so it's too soon to see results,"I've been using this product once a day for about 3 weeks and haven't seen any results so far. However, it's taken many years for my skin to look like it does and I can't expect miracles. Again, it's too soon to see results but once the lotion/elastin is gone I'll have a better idea."
3,Not what I thought,This book was not at all what I thought it was. I thought that Ed Greenwood was continuing the storyline. Instead all this book tells me is the family history of a character. Not worth buying.
2,Poor Quality,"I purchased my first Nordic Ware pan from Wal-Mart several years ago. It lasted about 3 years before some of the non-stick coating began coming off. The Nordic Ware pans I purchased last Christmas have already started to shed their coatings, after just 3 months of use. It is very disappointing. I recommend that you save your money and purchase a better quality product."
5,amazing,"Each time I listen to this album, I find myself listening harder and harder to Westerberg's lyrics. So incredibly thought provoking. This album has long been one of my favorites and will never cease to be so."
5,buy it dammit,"Journalists always prefer to write about Let It Be, Pleased To Meet Me is probablly more accesible and the production/mix isn't very good. But simply on the quality of songs, this is a genuine classic. Swinging Party and Here Comes A Regular are the classic ballads, Left Of The Dial and Bastards Of Young are the anthems and the rest is sort of rock, sort of pop and totally brilliant......AND, this is the greatest kareoke album ever made. after 10 listens try and avoid singing along to every song. Can't? I thought as much. The Replacements might well be the greatest band of all time and this is their best album."
5,The Best,"It's sad when you hear people talk about the greatest rock-and-roll bands of all time - names like Zeppelin, The Who, The Stones, Beatles, etc.. You quickly realize that these people never heard of the Replacements. Not to discredit these other bands - they were all great and served as influences to the boys from Minneapolis, but they all pale in comparison. Anyone who has never experienced this band is sorely deprived. Please buy Tim. Also buy Let it Be. You will then know who the greatest band in the history of rock-and-roll is."
2,not my favorite mats album by any means,"I've never understood why so many people place this at the top of the Replacements canon. The songs are fantastic, but the album sounds like the producer (Tommy Ramone by the way) put a layer of plastic over the recording. The lead guitar is never allowed to roar, and the sloppiness that made the Replacements so fantastic is reigned in. That being said, ""here comes a regular"" is one of the greatest songs ever written, and the rest of the album isn't bad, but it could have been much better since the songs are there. The next album is way over produced, but the sound is way more open, making it a far better album, even though they kicked Bob Stinson out after Tim. Personally, I like all the early albums a lot better. The early ""hardcore"" stuff isn't really that much different from the later stuff, its just less polished. I really can't get past the horrible production. This album is way overrated as is and would be vastly improved by a remix!"
5,Grit and glory in a pop rock package,"The Replacements probably aren't for everyone but if you're looking for something accessible and comfortable to introduce you to these icons of pop-punk, ""Tim"" is probably your best choice. Although it may be disappointing to some, ""Tim"" never decays into the drunken bellowing that characterized The Replacements career. The production is polished, the mixing and mastering are smooth. The songs range from the teen angst ""Kiss Me On the Bus,"" to the silliness, ""Waitress in the Sky,"" to the hard rock anthems ""Little Mascara"" and ""Left of the Dial.""A fine album which was toned down a bit to give it some commercial appeal. That's not always a bad thing, and ""Tim"" proves it."
5,"Timmy boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling...","While ""Tim"" doesn't match up to ""Let It Be"" for intensity, it's still one of the most earnest, finely crafted rock albums of the 80s, and still turns heads when it's played today.The band was unmistakeably on a high to start their major label debut off in fine style, and they do. The production is a squeaky clean, but not to a fault. Dig ""Little Mascara"", ""Bastards Of Young"", ""Kiss Me On The Bus"", and ""Hold My Life"" for kick-a$$ lyricism as well as chops. Mellow out to ""Waitress In The Sky"", ""Swinging Party"", and ""Here Comes A Regular""(the Irish drinking song that never was).Extremely underrated, and one album that gets under your skin in no time flat."
3,Very Nice Book,Beautiful photographs. Instructions are easy to follow and supplemented with photographs. I was disappointed that the recipes emphasize use of the microwave oven. (We have opted not to have a microwave oven). They don't give parallel instructions for conventional ovens. Otherwise a great book. Everything from traditional to creative new crafts. I'm glad I bought it.
2,Mediocre collection of essays,"Turhan Tirana throws together a few loosely organized essays, with no common thread tying them together, one perhaps a little duller than the next, and produces a rather unremarkable read. Part memoir, part travelogue, with a little history thrown in, Tirana writes of fly fishing without the self deprecating humor of John Geirach or beautiful prose of Bill Barich. He somehow manages to make moments which lend themselves perfectly to writing-like courting his wife and being held at gunpoint-and make them drab and boring. It is a quick read, a little snobbish, as one reviewer has stated and certainly not the worst book ever, but really just another fly fisherman who feels compelled to tell the world the joy we receive from our sport, and fails to convey its beautiful aura."
2,a snobbish view of flyfishing,"Once again a rich somewhat snobbish writer thinks he has ""captured"" the essence of the sport. I was blessed to grow up in a rural upstate New York community near the birthplace of Art Flick, author of A Streamside Guide. My Dad and I fly fished as a means to unwind after a hard days work or to pass a Sunday afternoon. Unlike the author of this book, we didn't ""fish abroad"" and we tried not to be overly impressed with ourselves."
2,Disappointing colour,"I realise that colour can often be difficult to transmit accurately online, but this boppy cover in ""orange"" stripes was horribly misleading. Even the cardboard image that came with the packaging was identical in shade and colouring to what appears in this picture online, but in actuality, the colours are VERY bright and garish. Mostly strawberry reds and crass pinks. I would have never picked this item, had I known it would look this way. The cotton is not very soft at all. To be fair, I'm sure it accurately fits any boppy that needs a cover, but I will give this one away or throw it out. Total waste of money."
3,Color is Misrepresented,"I agree that the color is very misleading. The color is very bright orange, pink and purple - colors I would not have purchased if it would have been accurately represented. I do like that it is reversible though..."
3,Read or use for a devotional!,"Beautiful Threads: Pieces of Encouragement for Quilters is 49 heartwarming stories filled with historical facts, spiritual insights and a passion for fabric and the end result; quilts. You don't have to be a quilter or even know one to enjoy this book and the message Tatem delivers. But if you happen to be a quilter, it will delight you.Tatum starts each section of the book with a description of a quilt pattern, continues with the quilt stories and ends with a Bible verse and a small devotion-like paragraph.It was a cold spring day when I began reading this book. I wrapped myself in the lovely quilt made for me by my mother-in-law, fixed some tea and lost myself in the stories of hope, faith and love. There is, I learned a similarity between quilting and mixing and matching the pieces, threads and fabrics of our lives.This is a wonderful book to keep by your bed (to be read or used as a devotional) or to give as a gift to a special person in your life."
3,"Beautiful, but quite long winded....","I really like fantasy novels... Neil Gaiman rocks my world... so i tried to read Fellowship of the Rings. Whereas, i will say that the language is beautiful, and the characters are charming, and the plot interesting... it can be considered long-winded. This book is fun, but don't expect it to be light reading to whiz through. They spend 80 pages walking down the same road - it's almost as though the book is written in real time. I wanted to say, ""Frodo... Are we there yet?""I do recommend this book... it is wonderful... but only if you have the time and patience to get through it."
2,Try another by this author,"Back Cover description: INSTANT BRIDEGROOM. Shaan had been jilted! She'd been left at the alter by Piers Danvers...but Rafe Danvers was waiting to step right into his half brother's shoes. Older, darker, stronger and head of the Danvers business empire, it was Rafe who had persuaded Piers to abandon Shaan. Now, with the same ruthless determination, Rafe insisted that she become his bride instead. Dazed, Shaan accepted his proposal, but she was also confused: until this moment, Rafe had acted as if he despised her. Suddenly he wanted to proclaim her to the world as his wife and, behind closed doors, to have her in his bed!Not her best. I didn't like this one. It was predictable and I couldn't like either character. She had no backbone, and he was manipulative/sly--not uncommon with these books, but not what I expected from a Michelle Reid story. However, I have read 5 of her other books, and this is the first I didn't like, so I will try her again."
2,this really drug on for me,"I rarely give bad reviews, but I could only get half way through this book, and at half way through the book we were still on day one, yes that is not a typo, the couple were still on the first day of being together half way through the book. I finally couldn't take it anymore. I want to see the romance longer than a day, or even a few days. It needs to move along. I love an alpha male, and a strong heroine, but this just didn't do it for me. I love the other Michelle Reid books that I have boughten, but I would not recomend this one."
2,Minimal protection. NO heat resistance.,"I have one of these for my 6'6"" Rusty.The sock fits well and is easy to put on and take off when the board is dry.Negatives:1. If your board is even a little wet, the sock is sticky and is very hard to put on and take off.2. There is almost no protection value of the sock. If you drop the board or knock it against something, you will crack the fiberglass.3. There is NO sun/heat protection. If you leave a surfboard in this bag in you car or in the sun (even on your roof rack), the surfboard will bake and yellow the foam and even delaminate the glass if you have an epoxy board.Do yourself a favor and get a real board bag like a Dayrunner or Dakine deluxe to protect your surfboard.The sock cover is best at protecting your board from dust.If you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up with the voting buttons below!Thanks."
2,No Support,Reasonably priced boots. Purchased these boots to replace a pair of Tingley insulated rubber boots that I had used for at least 15 years. The leather uppers offer no support. The removable liner is nice but seems way too soft. Seems like it will be difficult to use these boots to work in.
4,Pretty Good,"A few songs on this album keep it from being aming their best, but there are so many great songs here that it's hard not to be impressed. ""Love Kills"" about Sid and Nancy Vicious, is one of the best songs on the album, featuring a rare vocal performance by Dee Dee."
5,Ramones 4evah,"O.K.. This may not be my FAVORITE Ramones album BUT, The Ramones Have never ever made a bad one. Somebody put something in my drink is instant classic. Just try not relate to the heart wrenching vocals and lyrics of she belongs to me. The Ramones were never overtly political but felt is was time to speak up when Reagan dur Furhur forgave the Nazis ('Bonzo Goes to Bitburg.) Hell, I could go on about every song. Hooks all over the place that would make Brian Wilson proud. This is essential to any Ramones fan new or old."
3,Animal Boy?,"This is unfortunantly, the Ramones weakest album. Animal Boy lacks alot of substance due to the growing bad relations between Joey, Johnny, and Dee Dee. They were not getting along so in turn they were not getting any good material. Not to say that there are absolutely no good songs here. ""Love Kills"" is a good song written for Sid Vicious and Nancy Spungen by Dee Dee. ""Somebody Put Something In My Drink"" which was written by new drummer Richie is a great rocker, but the adding of synthesizers to a drinking song does not work in my opinion. ""Freak Of Nature"" is a good one, and so is ""Bonzo Goes To Bitburg"". As the rest of the album goes, its best if you leave Animal Boy locked in a cage."
2,Not very enjoyable!,"2 stars because of songs like ""Animal Boy""and ""Apeman Hop"". The others are just down right stupid. This began the trend of bad Ramones Albums unleast until 1992."
1,trash,"This a lame, lame Ramones record. The only good tune is My Brain Is Hanging Upside Down. I can't believe anyone bothered to reissue this on cd. You are a complete sucker if you buy this cd."
3,This album is an acquired taste,"'Somebody Put Something In My Drink' and 'Bonzo Goes To Bitburg' are great Ramones classics and the rest of the album is a mixed bag -- but with a few surprises worth discovering ('Love Kills' -- a heartfelt tribute to Sid and Nancy by Dee-Dee, 'Freak of Nature', 'Hair of the Dog' and the anthem-like 'Something to Believe In' are all good songs). 'Animal Boy' (the song) is considered a hit by Ramones standards, but ultimately isn't anything special, and both 'Apeman Hop' and 'Crummy Stuff' are dreadful after repeated listenings. Overall, theres enough here to merit a reserved recommendation."
4,Our whole class loved Mac,"I teach a combined age classroom of 2nd and 3rd graders and we just recently finished reading Mac McGerp aloud. The kids loved it! They said it was great, funny, and exciting and, most importantly of all, they didn't want it to end. They wanted more adventures of Mac and his fabulously destructive burping power.It really was a tremendous response, like the kind you'd expect from a Roald Dahl book. It reads quickly and every chapter ends with a cliff hanger, leaving the kids demanding more. When the laughs come, they come big. Truly an enjoyable and light read. We'll be looking for more from this author!"
5,Chantal is fabulous!,"This Chantal casserole is wonderful. I have used it for a number of stir-fries and it has an amazing capacity. Of course, I was predisposed to like this as I love Chantal!"
5,Good toy/model of the Naboo Fighter,"This is the Naboo N-1 Fighter from Star Wars Episode 1.The Naboo N-1 Fighter is 6"" long (tail to engine) and 4"" wide (engine to engine). The hatch opens to fit the poseable pilot, and the landing gears deploy, but R2-D2 is not removable. This toy also comes with a stand for display.This toy is hard on the main body, but the tail is made of a bendable plastic so it wont brake during play. However, this is also a good model for the avid star wars collector."
3,Filter construction issues,Ordered and received this filter directly from Amazon. When I tried to install it in my 01 Olds Aurora the filter started to come apart. The glue used to hold the filter element to the filter frame was not done correctly when the filter was made. The filter separated from the filter frame. Contacted Amazon and a replacement was sent out ASAP. The replacement installed with no problem. I was a little surprised that Bosch would have such QA issues. Have never had a problem with any other Bosch product in the past.
2,It's OK,"I bought this DVD because I am a fan of Billy, but would not recommend it to people that are looking for a fast-paced cardio workout (ironically). It focuses a lot on strength training in the arms...in fact, too much in the arms and not enough in my core area or legs. I was disappointed with the pace because my heart rate never got high enough to feel like I was getting a great cardio workout."
2,Not what I expected,"I bought this expecting a look into a cultures spiritual beliefs, and instead I found a comparison to Christian beliefs. It seemed like the writer was more interested in how the ""redman"" were following Christian practices (like if it wasn't Christian it wasn't approved)by another name rather than looking at how their beliefs worked for the people independently. I found the constant references to Christianity annoying and couldn't even finish the book. If you are Christian you would probably have a much different experience (as a Christian referred this to me) If not you may want to stay away."
2,don't bother...,"Initially, I started reading this book because it is about someone who went to BU (where I am currently an undergrad). However, after forcing my way through it, I want my $13 back. The author's writing is full of unfounded self-importance, and, to be honest, I could not stand the main character. I could relate to her problems, but not to her tendency to do nothing but whine about them. Overall, I found I spent the entire book just waiting for it to be over. For Catherine to DO something... even the promised ""exciting nightlife"" scenes are boring and dull."
1,Failed in 3 Months,"I replaced my thermostat in two vehicles after an overheating incident in our Chevy Van. I didn't want the same failed thermostat causing a new over heating problem, so I replaced the thermostat in our van and in our Jeep Cherokee with these ""Failsafe"" thermostats. Within three months, neither vehicle would get to operating temperature. In fact, both failed during the Fall months when the temperature typically never gets to 80 degrees F. Neither vehicle would generate enough heat to operate the heater properly when the temperatures dipped below 30 degrees F.I replaced both thermostats with OEM. Both of the ""failsafe"" thermostats were stuck open as a result of the added ""failsafe"" clip. As far as I can tell, these thermostats will always fail once the vehicle gets to operating temperature. Both vehicles now operate properly with the OEM thermostat. It is great to have heat in the Wintertime."
5,cool in summer,nice accurate and works perfect my car run like a new...the tempeture drops a lot almost 190 max from 215- 220 nowsaving a lot of gas and the car run smooth. 1999 dodge truck
3,Where's the Bowl?,"There are many ""cutting"" toys to choose from. I chose this one because I thought it came with a cute fruit bowl to store the fruit. Well, it does not come with any bowl. If it isn't included, then it should not be in the picture. This seems to happen quite frequently, which I'm sure ends up in frustration for many customers.****Update****. It's funny how other reviewers will try to correct earlier reviews, such as ""giving them a lesson on fine print."" When I ordered this product over a year ago, a bowl was pictured and there was no ""fine print"" stating anything about the missing bowl. Reviews are supposed to help others, which was my intention. Apparently it did help because Amazon has changed their picture and now added ""fine print."" So, please people, don't treat previous reviews as if they were written by idiots that don't read the descriptions."
4,Cute set,"My daughter like this set to use with her play kitchen. She's almost 2, and I'd say she's a little too young to really understand the purpose of the velcro and knife part of it, but she has a blast ""eating"" all her fruits and using her knife on all her other play food. It's a plastic set, but the plastic is a hard plastic, so it won't be crushed by a too-enthusiastic toddler."
5,Fantastic! Highly recommend!,I bought this for my 2 year old daughter to fill her new play kitchen and SHE LOVES IT! These fruits are really clever and teach her about food as well as are fun to play with. I also bought the vegetable set too!
5,My how pretend food has changed!,"I am still amazed at how much pretend food has changed since my kids were small, 30+ years ago. I love how these can be peeled and sliced. The downside is that there are that many more pieces to contain because it's more fun to take them apart than it is to put them together. I would also like to express a caution about the orange peel. When it is separated from the inside of the orange, the pieces have very sharp points. My daughter stepped on one when she didn't see it and really hurt the bottom of her foot. It might not be a bad idea to remove these pieces from the set completely. None of the other fruits seem to have a hazard like this."
4,Fruit salad anyone...,"but you'll need a larger bowl. My grandson loves this toy. he is just 2 years old and needs help with stabilizing the fruit so he can cut them with the plastic knife (which is totally safe, not at all sharp). When he is unable to""cut"" the fruit, he is able to pull it apart.I hope the velcro will hold up.Small World Living Toys Fun-With-Fruit"
3,A little too complicated for my taste...,"But perhaps it is because I am not a great mystery fan, or the classics. [I mean, did the question, ""Heautontimoroumentos?"" really make immediate sense to anyone else?]In any case, I found by keeping a score card so that I could track all the players, and parsing several passages in order to figure out the nuances of the author's syntax, I could plug on into the last few chapters which, though possibly the most surreal, were, IMO, the most accessible.I would recommend looking for a copy to borrow before buying if you were, like myself, considering reading it because of Williams' ties to the Inklings."
5,Just one of my all-time favorites,"There exists nothing like Charles Williams novels, in extraordinary Christian fantasy. He was a genius, who saw into the depths of spiritually, beyond religious orientations, and glorified God in every novel he wrote. Next to the Bible, his works are my favorites, in all of the Christian fiction literature that I own."
2,not what I expected,"I loved C.S. Lewis' _The Great Divorce_, and I was hoping to find something similarly imaginative here. But the writing was so stilted that I couldn't read past the first three chapters."
4,Basic geography in your lap,"As a geographer, I appreciate a simple book that explains basic concepts simply. I've TA'd Geography classes where college students didn't come with the understanding this book can provide. I'm half tempted to make this required reading if I ever teach an Intro to Geography course! It might be a bit much for the very young (the side bars screw up the lyrical rhythm of Dr. Seuss books), but fun and educational none the less"
4,Great Book!,"I love this book for my 6 year old! He really enjoys reading it and it teaches him the basics of different map readings. I love the series of these books from Tish Rabe, since they are educational unlike other Dr. Seuss books."
4,"Good, not great","I love, love Dr. Seuss books. My 3 children and I have read them all. Even the ones you have never heard of. I appreciate the effort, but there is much lacking for it to be called a genuine Dr. Seuss book. The boys like it, but it is not one they pull off the shelf to read. They would rather ""The Cat in the Hat"", or ""Green Eggs and Ham"" (or any of the others).It has to be my idea to read this one.I do realize that it is a non-fiction book, but the rhythm & some of the rhymes just don't work. I think they could have done a little more to make it ""sing-song"". That's what makes a Seuss book!"
3,Great night light.,"This night light is very practical as it lights the room but is subdued. It is bigger than I thought it would be, rather bulky, and not as pretty as I imagined."
3,Does not look like Picture on Website,The night light's size is perfect. However its not as bright as the image that appears on the site.I would have preferred something more bright
4,Pretty nightlight,It was a gift and my daughter seemed to like it very much when I gave it to her. It's pretty and looks durable. I was satisfied with the whole process of getting it.
2,eh,"Looks a lot more cheesy than I expected. Plastic and will likely hold up well, but just not classy like I had hoped."
5,Dragonfly & Cattails NightLight,I received the night light rapidly and was very pleased with the quality. The nightlight is very pretty both on and off. The only down side is that the person I was getting it for has GFCI oulets mounted sidways???? go figure...and the base on the plug doesn't turn so she couldn't use the nightlight. On the upside...I now have a very pretty nightlight!
2,Not as delicate looking as I thought it would be,This nightlight look better in the picture than the real thing. It is different and I like that
5,Terrific Resource,"A must read for academics, citizens and political professionals. The strategies discussed are based on real life events, not just ideas and theories."
4,Checkmate. E2-E4,"One of the first major attempts at ambiance/techno with an emphasis on being vertical rather than horizontal. While all music tends to be constructed with rhythms and beats measured in a timescale manner (hence horizontal timeline), Manuel Goettsching has attempted to create vertical music. The result is a focus on texture, layers of sound and richness of ideas. Possibly on par with Thursday Afternoon by Brian Eno. As a good subtext, the metaphor of a chess game being played out in all of it's quiet intensity and emotional peaks and valleys is quite fitting. Perhaps another good analogy would be the Kind of Blue sessions that Miles Davis recorded, where the emphasis was on texture, sound and melody, versus trite patterns and tired old ideas that only give the impression of being innovative. Worth a listen."
4,fascinating,"""""Many have speculated, in fact, that had this track not existed, the explosion of equally-important dance music from the Detroit scene in the late 80's (the one that led to techno heading to Europe for that important summer back in 1987) might not have occurred""""I wouldn't go quite that far as early electro and ""Sharevari"" by Number Of Names were out at the same time as E2-E4, music which was far closer to detroit techno than this piece, however i'm sure this was some influence to the detroit pioneers.this piece is nevertheless amazing, and anyone into electronic music at all who is interested in its roots should buy this."
5,Manuel Gottsching Is a Baller For Sure,"E2-E4 is such a sweet, smooth album. The guitar part right after the middle is too smooth, actually, and gets rather wonky but that is the exception rather than the rule. I love hour-long, single-song albums. This is the ""Dopesmoker"" of early German electro."
4,Cute but pricey - valance is different width than curtains,"We had figured out that we had to buy the valance separate from the curtains, however, we didn't realize the valance would be a different width than the curtains. The curtains come with two panels per pack, but the valance only comes with one panel in a pack. We didn't realize the situation until we hung them up and the valance didn't stretch across the whole window. So we ended up needing to purchase an extra valance for each window, making these curtains a lot more expensive than we had originally planned. But they do look fantastic in our son's room, and we are very happy with them now that we have all the pieces we need."
5,love them,they are thin and need a liner behind them to block out light but they are very cute and perfect for my sons room!
2,"Sharp sounding, of very average quality harmonica","I have this one but not with black plates (they do not do them anymore) but with chrome plates and yes with golden mouthpiece. The overall quality is very poor: the quality of polish is below average, the after polish file sighs is everywhere, two holes are dead on all four notes, the slide is jumpy and noisy. For less money you can get Suzuki SCX-64 that is head and shoulders above this one in about every department. The sound of this is very bare bone, primitive, unsophisticated. The harmonica not responsive as Suzuki. Overall you got my point , buy Suzuki, for the money I really can't recommend this Hering. I paid some $170 so I expected to have fine quality instrument, instead I received third world quality metal stick with even not notes playable. The case is plain piece of plastic with no lining inside. I do not recommend this harmonica."
5,Bravery we can all learn from,"If you have an addiction of any kind that is taking over your life and the lives of loved ones, this book is defiantly a must for you to read. but even if you are addiction free there are many lessons to be learned on facing adversity and overcoming what seem to be insurmountable odds. Well written and very inspirational."
2,It doesn't taste good,The noodle doesn't have the regular real noodle texture. The flavor is very fake. It kind of tastes like sesame and peanut but it kind of doesn't. It has a very odd taste.
2,Not the best,"I previously read submitted reviews, and I should have listened. Especially to the one that stated he didn't get the organic product shown in the picture. I too did not get the organic product. I have seen it in the stores, and it has a much lower sodium content per serving. I haven't been able to find it in a while so I thought I would buy it through Amazon.The product was the old stuff with an expiration date of 6 months from now. Usually the product in the store carries and expiration date of a year, so that tells you something right away.The noodles are okay. My family is not that particular, so it's a good side dish on ocassion. If you are an expert on peanut noodles, this dish is not for you. It's slightly gummy and thick."
1,Company no help,"I left my kettle on the burner too long & the copper melted off! Now I have a super expensive piece of junk. I wanted Chantal to re-plate it, but they say they don't do that.Very disappointing. I have 3 other of their enamel kettles & they have given me years of service."
2,Toot-less Teakettle,"The harmonica does not toot at all. I have replaced the whistle a number of times, and it is still toot-less. Also, bad ergonomics: handle too hot to handle. High maintenance cleaning indeed."
1,Attractive but far from functionally perfect,The manufacturer sent a hot-pad for the handle so you won't burn your hand. Very inconvenient and silly. Awkward pour...requires two-step or two-hand use to open the kettle spout and pour. Too expensive for such a poorly engineered and designed product.
1,Endless gunk at the seams,"I wanted a copper tea kettle for years and finally got this one. On washing it out for the first time, I found on drying it that if you rub a damp tissue around the seams on the inside where the bottom meets the sides and where the spout meets the body, you will see dark-colored gunk coming off on the tissue. I washed it over many times, but it didn't go away. I wrote the company, and in the reply, they indicated that it shouldn't be doing it, and it was indeed an unhealthy situation if it was. I probably should have sent it back to them and try to get a refund, but I just threw it away, having never used it. If you own one of these, try the damp tissue test and please comment and let me know if you have the same issue."
1,thick black long hairs stuck in the wedge on the inside,looks like whoever was making this kettle had long hair or was near a horse or an animal. when i opened the lid to my horror i found two hairs stuck in the lining where the bottom meets the sides. and they would not come out. they are stuck there. i am returning this kettle.looks like quality control did not do any quality control but just stuck the sticker on there saying 'passed'.
3,Witty and fun but spread too thin.,"I saw Laurie Anderson perform ""United States"" in London shortly after this recording was made, and it stayed with me as a very special event, so I was very excited when I got these CDs. After a while I was struck by how much is missing: the concert was a very visual experience, and on the CDs you sometimes are reminded of this when you hear the audience respond to something you can't see. Also I feel that most of what's best here is done better on ""Big Science"", so unless you're a Laurie Anderson-obsessive you're probably better off with that. Still... I'm glad I have ""United States""."
4,Margo's reviews,"Smartwater filter came with the refrigerator so this purchase was a replacement for the original. The filter received in a few short days, reinstalled quickly and easily and the water tastes great. Cannot honestly compare it with other filters but am satisfied with what I have."
4,Fortune Telling With Food,"I bought this book and we have had a lot of fun with it. I've used the self evaluation test with friends and co-workers and everybody found the results to be quite accurate. Its a fun way to take a fresh look at the foods in your diet. The compatability ratings especially among couples was very accurate and uncanny. There are also some interesting insights on the values of many common foods & beverages. Its fun,light reading and doesn't pile on all of the worn out nutritional hoopla so common in other nutrition books. I met and talked with Noriko Kuriyama and she really knows about health & nutrition and its very interesting what they are teaching and practicing in Japan. Sure worth a read."
5,Fun for 7 year old,"My 7 year old LOVES these pennants! They are perfect for his small hands. Each morning he gets online to check the scores from the previous day. He rearranges his pennants based on who plays who, rankings, etc."
1,Egyptians finally rival Soft Boys...,"It took Robyn awhile to hit stride after the departure of Kimberly Rew. Fegmania! along with Soft Boy's Underwater Moonlight are gems from pop heaven. For who prefer stark accoustic brilliance, Robyn Hitchcock's Eye, and I Often Dream of Trains are highly recommended."
3,Pretty good jazz-rock fusion,"This is a fairly entertaining jazzy keyboard disc. There are two vocal songs, ""Action Figure Party"" and ""Clock Radio"" which aren't that good (maybe I'm dense and not understanding the lyrical meaning, or maybe the words are awfully banal). The rest of the album is instrumental, and Greg Kurstin plays a variety of piano and keyboard sounds. He's an excellent player. The songs are fairly straight-forward, so they're accessible, if a bit light."
5,The ultimate love story,"This book should be read first before Heaven's Wager and When Heaven Weeps since it is referred to often in the rest of the series. Ted Dekker knows how to capture our attention with this story of a priest with a group of women and children, standing their ground against a sadistic soldier during the war. Despite the suffering these Christians endure, we see that all that really matters is our love for Christ and His love for us. It makes us long for our real home as we realize that our trials on earth are but momentary trouble."
5,WOW!!!,"I think this is my second favorite of Dekker's books, it is amazing I would STRONGLY recommend it. It's not as much of a thriller but it's just an awsome book. I haven't read the whole series yet but I'm going to start on Heaven's Wager next I think. I would recommend any of Ted Dekker's books, especially Showdown."
1,Disappointed,"Deja Vu: Most of The Martyr's Song is a reprint of When Heaven Weeps. If you've read it, you aren't going to miss much by skipping this one. I'm really glad I borrowed it from my local library because I'd hate to pay for it. Every other Dekker novel is well worth it's purchase price and I'd wholeheartedly recommend any Dekker novel EXCEPT this one."
1,just dumb,"horrible story where a couple of people who are being brutally murdered try to reason to their killers by saying ""please sir, God loves you!"" The ""true beauty"" that the story reveals to the girl would more likely make her angry at wasting her time, so what if God thinks your pretty, Timmy still thinks you look like a dog, and isn't taking you to the dance. Finally, the story is just unbelievable, I cannot see an old woman walking around her house screaming ""MARCH!"" just because she comes across it in a story. Basically, the book is so obviously self-righteous that it becomes a bad propaganda tool to make us what..love ourselves because soldiers killed people for the fun of it?"
3,the one thing this book won't do....,"""The Martyr's Song"" is sort of a fictional sequel to Ted Dekker's non-fiction book ""The Slumber of Christianity"" (see my Amazon review). In it he tries to give a ""real-life"" example of what it means to delight in Heaven, in the world to come.The story is very interesting and often heart-wrenching. Some of the main characters give their lives valiantly for the truth and show what it means to ""love not your life unto death"". I recommend it above most other fiction that's available out there. It should encourage you.That being said, the one thing this book won't do is clearly share the Gospel with you. Dekker favors language about having a loving relationship with God over actually explaining what Christ did for us on the cross and what we must believe in order to be saved. The book would be much better (and infinitely more helpful for unbelievers) if he talked about both."
5,Dekker at his best,"_The Martyr's Song_ is pure and simple, Ted Dekker at his best. The story is riveting and moving. It's a novella, so you can read the whole book in one sitting, but its punch far outweighs its length. Get it, read it, be moved by it. Dekker writes with passion and the reader can feel it. By the way, the Todd Agnew song on the CD it comes with is great, too. You'll listen to it over and over again."
2,Distorted audio on SSB,"Had the radio for a few weeks before I had a chance to make some SSB contacts and all reported distorted audio. The receive audio sounded good, just the transmit audio has the problem. AM mode works great, with excellent reports. The swr on the antenna was 1.2:1 so there was no problem with the antenna. Since the AM sounded excellent I would not think the problem was with the mic. The internal speaker had some rattle to it so I hooked up an external speaker. The ANL and NB were excellent in my mobile setup. I did a google search and found another report of the same problem."
1,AWFUL!!!!!!!!!!!,"I have one of these new made in China Cobra 148 GTLs and it is NOTHING like the older ones made back in the early 1990s and late 1980s. Mine quit less than 24 hours after obtaining it. No transmit and no receive... Nothing. Now i have to get it fixed... What a joke! Cobra used to be a top name in CB circles and now they have made a bad name for themselves. Of course Uniden no longer makes anything for Cobra anymore... I hate to say it but Cobra better get thier act together or they will go the way of Robyn, Teaberry, Lafayette, and a few others into the dustbin of CB history... I wouldnt touch one of these loser radios with a 10 foot pole!!! STAY AS FAR AWAY FROM THIS LEMON AS POSSIBLE!!!!!!"
2,not what was stated,This radio looks great but it is faulty and only puts out 1 watt.I am having to send for repairs due to faulty rf finals.Very disappointing. :-(
3,It grows on you,"When I took this out the pacakging I hated it, it was alot smaller than I expected. And I did not like the material on the underside. I thought it was cheap looking. But, when I slept with it that night, all of that changed. Its actually quite comfertable, and will keep you warm."
5,Great throw at a great price!,"I ordered 10 these for Christmas gifts, but I had to keep one for myself. It is very soft, and even though it is thin, it is very warm! My cat has discovered how warm my new throw is and loves to sleep on it. It helps that it is machine washable, to get all that cat hair off. I am very pleased with these throws!"
5,Great throws for a very good price,"I wasn't sure how good these would feel since the price is so low, but I went ahead and ordered 6 anyway because I have the Amex Wishlist coupon and wanted to use the $25 off $129 coupon on top of that.Anyway, these feel very good and the build quality is pretty good (8/10). For $11 or $12, they are definitely worth it. These make very good Xmas gifts."
2,Not very cozy,"I didn't find this throw particularly warm, soft or thick. Maybe ok for an extra layer in bed, but I'd definitely reach for something else to curl up on the couch. In this case, you get what you pay for."
2,Sheds Feathers Quickly and is COLD to the Touch!,"I bought this product last winter (2007) because of the many good reviews. I would NOT recommend it for purchase because it loses it's feathers *very* quickly and becomes incapable of trapping warm air. After one season and one washing, I have a very flat product that is 'linty' with feathers.Also, the throw is made of a material that retains the cold temperature of the room around it (unlike a fleece wrap). When you first wrap yourself in it - BE PREPARED FOR THE SHOCK OF HOW COLD THE WRAP ITSELF IS! It can be very unpleasant (like crawling under cold bedsheets in the middle of winter) until your body heat warms the wrap up.The size is good, but this is definitely *not* a product worth $20. The wrap is supposed to keep *you* warm, not you keep *it* warm.O"
1,"Price, please","On the Amazon ad, the price is 12.99, but when you click to put it into your cart, it adds 21.99 to the cart."
3,My second review !,"Scroll down.This is a nice green color and doesn't look bad, but by all the great reviews, I was shocked when I got this!Maybe most reviewers here have not had a Fleece, or Chenille throw!There is no comparison..this is not so soft, it kind of reminds me of a sleeping bag, it has the same look about it, and its not because of the color!!Its not so puffy.not filled very much, but the material is thick, maybe that is what keeps some people warm!I also paid about $12.00 for this..At that price it a good deal, but I would never spend $19.99 on THIS Throw, as I do not think its worth it..This is my second review!After I have washed this throw a few times, and through it into the dryer, I really like it.It's now soft, and has kept it's shape.It's also more fluffy, and my dogs fur doesn't stick to it!If I could, I would give it 4 1/2 STARS. Not a 5 though, as it could be bigger...."
2,Soft but gets lumpy,"I bought one of these several months ago, and every time I wash it, it gets lumpy, all the filler seems to lump in the edges"
5,Great For the Money!!!!,"I bought this because I needed to replace some old cotton throws, and this appeared in the Gold Box and I thought, ""Well, I'll try it and take a chance, it's cheap.""It arrived and I opened it and WOW, was I surprised! It is worth far more that what Amazon is charging! Soft and fluffy, but not overweight for the warmth it provides. The light weight is due to the down. It will be in the teens degrees tonight and know I will be warm and happy while reading a book!I will be buying more for gifts. Can't beat this price!"
5,"Short but sweet (well, as sweet as dir en grey can get)","I stumbled across ""the agitated screams of maggots"" while glancing over the dir en grey section seeing if there were any new US releases since ""Withering to Death."" The new song, and title track, is excellent and ""Vulgar""-esque. The three live tracks are as raw as can be expected and is a nice switch from the flawless studio recordings. A bit short, but thats what you get for an import. All in all, this is a good disc to have to listen too for a good 15-20 minutes of wonderful hell and a good addition to the Dir En Grey collection."
3,Corner plate organizer rack,"This rack is O.K. It does not have enough room on the rack to hold more than 4 Correll bowls. Serves it's purpose although I found out that you can get it at your local discount store (Target, Wal-Mart, etc.) at the same price without paying shipping. I had free shipping on this item so it didn't really matter."
4,Great addition to kitchen organization,This item is sturdy enough to hold heavy kitchen items and does the trick. It helped provide stacking organization inside of a large cupboard under my stove.
1,A disoriented work of (humorous) fiction,"This book somewhat succeeded in terms of humor. I had quite a few laughs and I recommend it to those who believe in science and thus can treat this book as a work of humorous fiction. The ""facts"" are so distorted and out of context that I am shocked this is not categorized as a work of fiction. I guess Mr. Panzer is not familiar with third-world development and that the primary mechanism for progress in these developing nations is birth control. Come on now Mr. Panzer, stop skewing the facts for some particular ideology you want to promote in the name of self-interest. As a so-called ""academic"" I expect more responsibility and validity on your part. Shame on you."
3,student,The photographs capture what the imagination can't. The book appears to be a very condensed version of Jackson's life. If all you need is a basic outline this is the book for you.
5,"Fateful Harvest, an eye opener.","Fateful Harvest is a must read for anyone trying to lead a healthy lifestyle or anyone who has unresolved health issues. As a Healthcare Professional, I can assure you this book will give you a glimpse into what is really going on in the food chain and why we must all take responsibility for our own health."
2,Failed to make the case,"A real disappointing read. The dust jacket makes you believe the book'll prove cancer, death, and havoc befell this tiny town.It didn't. Scientists, government, and townfolk all say it was much hysteria about nothing.I agree. Strip away the enflamed rhetoric and you have..nothing..."
1,A sad book,"I was just getting into Fateful Harvest when September 11th hit. I had to force myself to finish reading, because suddenly the book's theme seemed so trivial and self-righteous.What difference does it make whether organic farmers use animal waste or other farmers use industrial waste? Is one type of waste ""better"" than the other? The question seems so trite right now. Our food supply seems like something to be thankful for right now, not something to create more fear about.This book simply saddens me now. Surely there are more important things to campaign for these days."
5,POWERFUL!,It is simple. Read the book. Decide if you want to eat your food with some toxic fertilizer sprinkled on by corporate-terrorists. Do your research and then decide what you are going to do about this horrendous insult to all life and the land around the world. This issue leaves me mourning for our world. Thankfully there are still dedicated people like Duff Wilson that uncover the scoundrels that have no conscience except for the dollar. Rachael Carson blew the whistle on DDT and now Mr. Wilson is blowing the whistle on toxic waste fertilizers unwittingly being used by farmers and gardeners everywhere. Wake up EPA!
4,Nowhere to turn.,"""Fateful Harvest"" was easy to read but the facts presented left me outraged and saddened. Read the book and learn of the magic trick of turning toxic waste with costly disposal fees into a product to sell, fertilizer. Fertilizer which is laced with heavy metals that will end up in our food in increasing amounts as the accumulation in the soil increases. Learn how the average citizen, small town mayor and farmer have zero ability to impact business practices which are supported by the government despite years of heroic effort and the expose of this book. Despite minimal cosmetic changes, the practice goes on, and is apparently unstoppable, leaving nowhere to turn."
1,Don't do it!,"I purchased this identical item in a local fabric/ craft store for $4.99. It is going back the next time I go there! The loom is plastic, which I don't have that big a problem with. The ""loops"" are horrible, some type of thin synthetic which would be a disaster when holding a hot cookie sheet. They are odd shaped, ""rolled"" but basically open fabric (not a ""tube""), some look dirty or marked with ink. They seem to be some sort of synthetic scraps. Not at all the potholder loops I remember from my childhood. I am SO glad I opened this before sending it to a friend's child as a gift!! I would have sent a substandard gift and I wouldn't even have known that!"
4,Good case for the price,"I had needed to get a proper camera case for awhile. The basic one I'd gotten with my digital SLR wasn't big enough and as a result I ended up carrying parts of my camera kit loose in my bag on occasion. That got me a broken lens, so I finally sat down and paged thru the 100s of bags to find one that isn't too expensive, too camera bag-ish, too big, too small etc. And so I landed on the Ape Case Pro - Large by Norazza. I like it. It holds everything I need it to (4 lenses, 1 camera body, miniDV camera, tapes, accessories, etc) + I can have my monopod AND a tripod attached to the straps at the base of the bag. I don't know if it is the perfect bag, but it sure does most everything I need it to and hangs pretty tidily off the back of my wheelchair as well."
3,"Average construction, useful dimensions, good value","The bag is very useful, spacious and lots of compartments. My only issues is the material construction. I have some loose stitches, and I have a lot of Velcro filaments in the bag, it's almost like Velcro dust, which can't be good if it gets in your camera or lenses.The top lid doesn't open very smoothly, and the strap could be sturdier. However, I really like the dimensions and the padding. So for the price, it really is good value."
5,Great bag,"I really love this bag. It's well made, durable, cleans up easily and holds much. I carry a Canon 40D, 70-200mm, 28-85mm, 55-105mm, flash, light meter and various items(batteries, cf cords, etc) and still haven't filled it up. I carry a lot of weight in it and the seams, zippers and clips have held up wonderfully. The bag it self is not huge but the inside is. I am a small female and have no trouble handling the bag."
5,Awesome Case!,"I bought this case for my Canon DSLR Camera with 3 separate lenses and my Panasonic HD-TM90 Camcorder. Not only could I EASILY carry all that, I am also able to carry around separate batteries for both the camcorder and the DSLR camera. I also was able to carry the charger for both as well. Plus I still have LOADS of room to carry other stuff. I bought this and then a few months later used it for a 7 day Disney World vacation which I just finished. This case was great. It has a bright yellow inside which made it EASY for the security at Disney to check my bag. It has a wonderful strap which made it easy to carry around Disney. Even my 12 yr. old son said it was easy to carry around. It also has a hard/firm bottom and it feels like it is padded so that if it fell off the table or something, my camera would not be harmed. Bottom line. It is durable and comfortable at the same time. I LOVE IT!"
4,"Bag is good, but small.","I bought it for my wedding photo equipment, but the size of the bag is too small to fit all the stuff.While you can fit 2 Canon 5D with battery grips on it, you will not be able to put even 2 mid size lenses on it like Canon 24-70mm. And it defenitely too small to fit the lens I use all the time Canon 70-200MM.So the bag would be good for amateur who use only one camera with 2-3 small lenses and one flash."
1,Make bigger. Fix zippers.,"Good News: Good look & thick padding. Yellow lining of the bag is a nice touch.Bad News: Much less compartment space than I had expected. Either padding is too thick or bag needs to be a bigger.More Bad News: Inside pocket zipper jams and separates when you try to put anything thicker than a notebook inside. I normally would fill the pocket, but zipper is so poor quality it comes apart easily. I returned the bag.Make bigger. Fix zippers."
2,disappointed,"There doesn't seem to be a straight line of thought in her writing, jumping back and forth between present and history in a very jumpy way. Both are good, just jumbled"
3,A journey through Sicily,This book focuses mostly on the many towns in Sicily and their festivals and processions. It explains the reasons as best as it can for the adoration of the Saints in the processions. It also gives a very affirming view of life in Sicily living on a farm and harvesting some of the most delicious fruit indigenous to each region. It has also whet my appetite to reading more and more about Sicily.
2,Little Stilted and Hard to Get Through,"I had high expectations for this book, but I find that it's quite hard to get through. I am very passionate about Italy, and especially Sicily, so it's not a lack of interest, but I find Simeti's writing to be a little hard to wade through. There's a bit of a feminist/pessimistic slant to her writing and be prepared for long sentences with multiple adjectives."
4,"Rich, spiritually-supported Latin Jazz.","Chango Te Llama is a great Latin Jazz album worthy of recognition. Daniel Ponce presents a soulful groove on all the tracks including my favorite, ""Chango Te Llama"" where an electrifying conga solo starts of the song. I recommend this album to the salseros who are tired of conventional salsa, to people who are santeros, and for those Anglos who are looking for something new. Daniel Ponce is accompanied by a bunch of great musicians who further this album's originality."
3,What ever happened to the Romans?,"Relatively quick & easy read on early Roman Republic up to Hadrian. Nero was not such a bad character, making numerous improvements. Author somehow emphasized how many freed slaves became rich, etc. Never discussed the downside of this station in life or how for many was a crippling one. Recommended."
1,What is this?,When I ordered this I expected it to be her life story. It wasn't it was simply the lyrics and music to her CD by this title. I was disappointed. I can't even begin to tell you where this book is now. I'm usually very careful about my books but I was so disappointed I misplaced this book and haven't bothered to look for it. I won't say don't buy it because for what it was it was ok. But if you think its her life story its not.
4,What alt-metal should sound like!,"Inhaler is a no nonsense heavy metal grunge album. There are killer riffs throughout and the sound is intense. You are not going to get anything very artsy or porgressive here. Tad just goes for the throat and doesen't let go. Meaty riffs and angry, growly vocals are what you are going to receive. There's not a dud in the lot, just mostly solid tracks and a few great ones. Grease Box, Throat locust, Leafy Incline, and Gouge are my favorites. If you like grunge or metal, definitely own this. Tad does the grunge and metal combination the right way, unlike talentless bands like Godsmack, Staind, Breaking Benjamin and many others."
5,Metallica should take note,"The opening track, like someone mentioned before, will compel you to drive to your record shop above the speed limit. Never fear: There's plenty of these around because it got MISSED! From the pummelling first track, you realize that these guys have what Metallica was trying to do on Load/ReLoad with the energy that the Metallicats left behind: These tracks smoke, simmer, melt, crank, rock, and the pounding drumming keeps it from getting slow. I'd say the energy in the drums is reminiscent of Season To Risk's 2nd record, and if Martin Bisi has produced this one, the drums would be in the room you're sitting in. Ah, a minor detail: Just crank this sucker!Highly recommended to Metallica fans, although it's grungier, it could be covered by them.Tad are one of the greatest overlooked Northwest powerhouse bands and should be in your collection YESTERDAY!"
4,Tad,"Good album, especially the song Grease Box. The rest of the album is also worth a listen and gets better each time you hear it."
1,terrible,It was the wrong cd and did not even have a case for it. I got ripped off by whoever sold it to me.
1,Totally Useless,"Small ineffective fans. After installation, there was less cold air flowing from the a/c duct than before. The only reason I awarded it 1 star, was because Amazon doesn't give you a ZERO star option."
3,Mildly Effective,"I bought this hoping to equalize the temperature in the room farthest from the furnace. It's pretty loud, but the tone is low enough to be somewhat soothing. I had every intention of ripping out the fans and replacing them with quiet CPU fans but my daughter doesn't mind. It's made a slight improvment, but not worth the price. I actually considered returning it, but the company was going to only issue a credit and they don't make anything else I need."
1,It doesn't produce the boost,First it took longer to receive the item than expected from the seller. Then it does not produce the boost which the product description promised.
4,Noisy but effective,"I got two of these (direct from manufacturer) for upstairs bedrooms on the West side of the house....despite double insulated window treatments, they stay at least four degrees hotter than the thermostat setting. These boosters keep that temperature lower than what they'd be without them. They really are noisy, though. Even set on ""low fan"", they're noisier than my ""white noise"" machine but I'm managing to sleep OK....if you're used to sleeping in dead quiet, these may take some getting used to. I just wish the vents were adjustable....I want my air blowing away from the walls, not perpendicular to them."
3,Works well,"The fan works fine, but the actual plastic parts are pretty cheap. I feel like it could break easily. I'm not sure I would purchase this item again for the price considering the fact it looks cheaply made. For 55 dollars, I thought I'd be getting an item that was better quality. Other than that, we are pleased with the function of the fan."
5,AirFlow Breeze,"The unit is just great, the Airflow helped my Office, in boosting the warm airflow from the register to all the room.ThanksJake"
3,"Worst yet, but still better than any other non-Aero album","Aerozonked, you took the words right out of my mouth. No such thing as a bad Aerosmith song, worst album,listened to the least out of any album not as bad as some say, if you're a real fan still buy it. 'Let the music do the Talking' is easily the best song on the album. Darkness is great if not overplayed. A few other bits' and peices aswell that excite."
2,Pretty Flat Aerosmith,"I have to say Done with Mirrors is a disappointment. Maybe the title has to do with the fact that trickery was used to make this album seem like a finished work. Seems like it was pretty hastily slabbed together. And while I do like the live, raw feel to the compositions, it does not make up for the fact that the songs are lacking personality, musically and lyrically. Nothing really stands out from the muffled blues-rock drone, despite a couple of moderately interesting tracks (My Fist Your Face and The Hop). Seems rushed really, maybe trying to cash in on the hype of the band being back together again after 6 years apart. So, while I applaude the fact that little production and mix magic was used as in some of their more resent stuff, I can't quite accept the apparent lack of effort and enthusiam put forth. Barely got 39 minutes out of it, even with a rerecorded Perry solo and bonus track."
3,Not Aerosmith's Best Effort...,"Just recovering from a break up and serious drug problems, Aerosmith once again bands together for an attempt at another album. Done With Mirrors, although a weak attempt, scored a few fans here and there, and gave older fans hope that Aerosmith was back in the game. The standout songs on this album have to be ""Let The Music Do The Talking"", ""My Fist Your Face"", and ""She's On Fire"". The rest is basically filler material, but helps you get through a boring day nonetheless. Not the best Aerosmith album, but it's still better than anything that they call music these days."
2,Not Their Best,"I don't remember recommending this album because it is not the best of Aerosmith by any stretch of the imagination. However, 2 songs are note-worthy: Let The Music Do The Talking and She's On Fire."
1,The worst Aerosmith album EVER!,"If you want all the Aerosmith albums, then buy this one last (even after the tribute albums, which are better than this garbage!) The songs are flat & for the most part unlistenable. I think all the other albums are good/great, but this one [isn't]. I don't think they could make another album this bad if they keep making albums when they're 80 years old! There's a good reason why this album's price is so cheap--they can't sell it any other way."
1,ITS GARBAGE,"I am a big fan of this band, but the last few CDS of theres that i bought are real bad, especially this one, i think its the worst, even the like maybe 2 good songs are only mediocre, the rest is boring and it sounds like it was recorded with really old equipment. dont buy it"
2,not their best,"I consider myself an Aersomith fan... I got all their albums and I think that this is their worth album, remember that they wrote this it when they were trying to get together again... but this wasn't a good try, they were trying to be the same bad boys as their golden years, but they WASN'T. Maybe it's a good rock album, but it just isn't Aerosmith."
2,Yikes!,"Let's put it this way... at least they made up for this with ""Permanent Vacation"". This is really the only sour fruit to come off of Aerosmith's tree over all of their years of making music. This is one of those types of albums that you'd hear OTHER aging rockers making (like the new Lynyrd Skynyrd, or The Rolling Stones) now because they've basically run out of ideas, but don't know how to do anything else. The only reason these types of albums sell any copies at all is because they have such a loyal fanbase. Don't get me wrong, I love Aerosmith! They're NOT one of those ""aging rockers"" because they stay up with the times, and are definitely the best American rock band ever (if not the best World rock band ever), but this album is just bad. Avoid it. Even ""A Rock In A Hard Place"" without the licks of Joe Perry and Brad Whitford is beter than this getting-back-on-track album. At least they made up for it since."
2,Exactly One Good Song on this Album,"Done with Mirrors continues the Aerosmith tradition (started with Draw the Line) of bad albums with exactly one good song on them. In this case the one good song is the first one, called ""Let the Music Do the Talking."" They borrowed a riff from ""Draw the Line"" for this song but it fit in nicely.""Gypsy"" is not bad but a lot of the songs are embarassing, the work of forty year old men with nothing to say churning out a hard rock album.At its budget price I can't say to avoid this album but don't expect an entire CD full of good songs. Think of it as a single with ""Let the Music do the Talking"" and a bunch of second-rate B sides."
2,Partially 'Done with Mirrors',"I am a huge fan of Aerosmith, just not of this album. A couple good songs (particularly 'The Hop') but unfortunately the whole exercise just feels like the band ran out of studio time. Songs are rough drafts and the production is barely adequate. Ted Templeton must have recorded this one is his garage. The autobiography 'Walk This Way' (a must read for any fan) discusses how the album and its lackluster sales forced the band to dry out once and for all. The next release was 'Permanent Vacation' and Aerosmith was back! So, perhaps the album served its purpose."
4,alan4162,this cd is good from the first song to the last.joe perry does more slide guitar on this cd and my opinion is it sounds awesome.highley recommended.
5,Last GREAT Aerosmith album. (I'm not a kid just didn't want to creat an account to write a review),"As I said this is the last great Aerosmith album. When I mean great I mean hard rocking album (although I've heard Honkin' on Bobo is good.) This one sounds alot like their older stuff, unlike their new stuff, which sounds like a bunch of pansies wrote most of them. Anyway this album is very good and I recommend picking this one up (especially since it's only $7.98). Check out their early stuff too, especially Draw the Line."
4,not in top form but still well worth a listen,i agree with dylman. i know the band members themselves don't like this album and the production could be better but despite that i can still hear that every one of these songs is great and the band's great presence and talent.
3,Not A Bad Comeback,"When Aerosmith rejoined for their ""Back In The Saddle"" tour in 1984 they needed a new record. Done With Mirrors shows you their back. It didn't exactly prove that they were back really. Fans news they reunited but it didn't have the energy that they rest of them have. Anyways the album is great. That and their next album ""Permanent Vacation"" was a sure comeback proving that Boston's Bad Boyz were back for good."
3,Not the best,"It seems as though they may have took a wrong turn somewhere on this one, but if you need an Aero-fix it will get you through. I suggest just listning to She's On Fire and Let The Music Do the Talkin"
3,good album-not the best,This Aerosmith album was great. I thought the remake of let the mustic do the talking orginaly by the Joe Perry Projet was great. This is a album I would recomend to some one that really likes Aerosmith!
4,"This first record of Aerosmith, Part II",". . . marked by the return of guitarist Joe Perry and the successful 1984 'Back in the Saddle' tour, really plays more like a coda to early Aerosmith. Produced by Ted Templeman (early-era Van Halen), 'Done With Mirrors' (1985) would be the last record before Steven Tyler and Joe Perry began writing with professional co-writers as a matter of course. Although 'Done With Mirrors' is not their best work, there are some great moments on this record - inlcuding Perry's slide guitar on ""Let the Music Do the Talking"" and ""She's On Fire"", Brad Whitford's riffing on ""Shela"", and Steven Tyler's dark piano stylings on ""Darkness"".It is unfortunate that the cuts on this record are overlooked by the band in their setlists due to the relatively disappointing record sales. I am also disappointed that Geffen recently chose to release all of the Aerosmith's Geffen catalog other than this one."
4,A very underrated album,"Done With Mirrors is probably the most underappreciated album in their catalog. While not as strong as their mid-70's gems Rocks or Toys In The Attic, it's much better than the albums they have released since Pump.The songs on this album are their most consistent since Rocks. The first two tracks ""Let The Music Do The Talking"" and ""My Fist, Your Face"" are the strongest tracks on the album and rock the hardest. ""Darkness"" is the obligatory ballad of the album and is one of their best. Other strong tracks include ""Shame On You"", ""Shela"", and ""Gypsy Boots."" The other tracks on the album are decent. That being said, this album is begging for a remaster as it suffers from muddy production on several of the tracks. If you're an Aerosmith fan, this is definitely worth checking out as it contains much more of their bluesy rock sound than their recent albums."
1,Gold plating improves light transmission!,"I have several pairs of these and have found them to modulate the electromagnetic carrier waves much more cleanly, allowing for crisper sound and noise-free video. As for the criticism, I think everyone knows that some kinds of gold can pass light much better than ordinary glass or plastic fibers - something doesn't have to be TRANSLUCENT in order to allow light to pass through. These are miles better than my old wooden ones."
1,"""Gold plated, that's funny""","If you think gold plating is going to do anything on a fiber optic cable, you need to learn a little bit about light transmission. Any cable without a continuous fiber optic strand is going to sound exaclty the same, hence the beauty of digital. Save your money and buy the $5 CablesToGo cable."
5,"Canon S95 Perfect Fit in ""Mini"" Size","I was looking for something from Op/Tech USA that would fit a Canon S95 compact camera. Their ""Mini"" sized soft pouch is literally a perfect, exact fit. I've used some of Op/Tech's other great camera pouches and this one doesn't disappoint, either. Lightweight and excellent construction -- with just enough protection for your camera, but without the bulk of other cases."
4,Amazon has it all wrong!!! This is a Cartoon!!!,"This is not the live action movie that Amazon says but a older cartoon from the sixties, I think. It stars Jim Backus (Mr Howell from Gilligan's Island) as the voice of Magoo and other voice actors in different roles. There is a whole series of these movies and this is the first release. Get it right people!"
2,Securing metal against plastic not a good mechanism,"They lasted a month , I barely touched them but once I wanted to readjust them, the metal fastener ate into the plastic base and they were no longer functional. Also, the arm has alot of bend to it which positioned my speakers further.I replaced them with a set of panavise 105108B stud mounts and couldn't be happier."
3,Did not mount great to my speakers,I used these for some new Energy Micro surround speakers. These are supposed to mount to nearly any speaker but they do not fit the Energy Micro's very well. I made them work and think I got them secured well enough.....but I had my doubts. The flexibility to have the speaker mounted in any direction is nice and they look pretty good on the wall.
4,"Great Product, Lousy Return Policy","The television itself is great, but we wanted to return ours because the speakers are not detachable (the other post on this site saying that they are is just wrong -- read the downloadable manual). Amazon's policy, which appears on the product page but is certainly not highlighted, is that any TVs over 27 inches cannot be returned (except for damage during shipment, etc.). Nor will Sharp do an exchange or return. We would have been willing to shell out for return delivery and probably even an upgrade to a different model, but Amazon's policy is firm."
1,They are crooks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Its been several weeks (since May) and I never got the DVD. They just took my money and made me wait an eternity. They basically stole my money. Never do business with them. I wouldn't recommend them even if they read this review and tried to make it right. BUYER BEWARE... Zero stars
3,Almost what I was looking for,Needs to be revised. 1972 printing is a little out of date. All Black & White. Could use some color. A lot has changed since this was written.
3,"Your basic raw, Chicago Blues cd","This is enjoyable but nothing special. It is raucous, raw, electric blues played by artists having a good time. Saw them on Conan, loved how Lil Ed jumped on the table. They are probably a fun band to see in an intimate setting. This is what the White Stripes wish they souded like...having a legit, blues creedo"
2,"RICK SHAQ GOLDSTEIN SAYS: ""I LIKE ED'S MEATLOAF, BUT IT AIN'T WORTH THE PRICE OF HIS BLUES!""","I don't intend to be mean, since Lil' Ed seems like a nice fun guy, but this is nothing but a lounge act, or juke joint band. He may be fun after you've had 10 beers, and everybody is sweating on you on the dance floor, but this is definitely not powerful electric blues. Ed's voice has no dynamic features at all. In fact there are only 2 songs on the CD that I would ever listen to more than twice. Obviously, Ed has a sense of humor, based on his ""Icicles In My Meatloaf"" song, but other than one other song, there is no ""Blues Meat"" on this CD. To be frank, I doubt anyone with real blues expertise and experience could possibly rate this above mediocre. Again, I'm sorry Lil' Ed, but just like the Budweiser Clydesdale's, though they are horses, you don't see anyone betting on them in the Kentucky Derby! Shaq says you need to decide if you want to order meatloaf."
1,Never received the book,I did not receive the book. I've sent an e-mail to the seller and to Amazon.
2,Dive Into Diversity,"I thought it would be about diversity. It touches the topic, but it is really about under sea life."
5,Majek Fashek Prisoner Of Concience,Caught Majek in concert 2 times and was spellbound! I had this tape and to my dismay it was displaced. I played it over and over. One of the best of all time African Reggae. The music is intoxicating. Prisoner of Concience to me is a one of a kind. It makes you think of peace and love.
5,great colander,very nice plastic colander for large quantities; drains well and cleans easily; would definitely recommend; it gets the job done well
4,Good,Very light. Not metal like I thought it would be. But works great. Very wide at the top and it drains well.
2,Cuisinart Colander - Poor Build Quality,"The overall design and performance of the Cuisinart colander is good, and I would have given it four stars except for one glaring problem. The problem is the build quality is not good. When I opened the box the black rubber coating on the handles was already peeling away. The rubber coating is extremely thin and does not appear to be durable. It is disappointing that a manufacturer with a good reputation like Cuisinart would produce a product with such poor build quality."
2,Not so killer....,"If you are an absolute beginner with no knowledge of online resources for tutorials and tips, then perhaps this book is for you. However, if you find yourself at an intermediate level, it is a waste of time and money. I was disappointed."
4,Audiomontage - Snert,"SNERT, the debut album by Audiomontage (better known as Jimpster), moves away from the fusion-electronic-jazz and into more club-friendly realms. ""Abuse,"" the opening track, is downtempo all the way, with its shuffling, head-nodding rhythm. ""Solaire"" is funky jazz, while ""Flyin' High"" is as uplifting as a 747. ""Barracuda"" starts by annoucing that it will introduce us to Latin rhythms, and by gosh, it does, with some nice vocal bits thrown in there for good measure. Although all the tracks are polished, a few of them don't have that extra soemthing that makes them stand out. ""Sound of Speed"" doesn't suffer from this, however; it's horns and breaks keep things moving to the end. ""Rezolution"" closes out the album on a dark, tribal-flavored journey. Pretty good altogether."
3,Good DVD/Bad disc,"The film itself is wonderful with plenty of thatched roof cottages and small English villages. HOWEVER, the disc won't play in my normal dvd player, though it will play in my portable player! The disc is visibly thicker and heavier than a normal disc. If you decide to go ahead and buy this make sure you test it as soon as you receive it!"
5,Its a classic,A must have for every serious evolutionary biologists. I highly recommend this book if you are interested in the history of species concept and speciation.
5,Excellent resource for the travel professional,"As a newcomer to the travel industry, this book has been a wonderful eyeopener. Even the most experienced travel professional can benefit from Mr. Mancini's knowledge of different places around the world.The language is easy to understand, the information pertinent for the travel professional's needs, and layout is clear and manageable (not overbearing or textbook-like).Mr. Mancini's reputation as an experienced professional in the travel industry is well acknowledged by his collegues and he is looked up to by newcomers, like myself.""Selling Destinations"" is a must have in every travel professionals resource library!"
1,THE TOY THAT NEVER COMES.,"THIS IS A TOY THAT IF YOU WANT IT, THAT IS ALL YOU WILL EVER DO IF YOU ORDER IT FROM THIS DEALER!!HE WILL NOT DELIVER AND DOES NOT ANSWER EMAILS FOR OTHER PRODUCT HE SOLD TO ME, SO I AM SURE HE WILL DO SAME WITH THIS PRODUCT!! HAVE FUN...GOOD LUCK!!"
2,Do not use for water sports.,I am an outrigger canoe paddler and wanted a GPS for training. The Garmin has all the features I was looking for but IT IS NOT VERY WATER RESISTANT. If you are thinking about purchasing one of these for paddling or other on the water activities...don't. Six months is all I got out of mine.
2,Garmin Forerunner 101 does not work for me,"The item does not respond as well as I would expect. It has difficulty to connect with satelites even in a relatively open outdoors, and its response is influenced significantly by overhanging trees. I would not recommend this item."
3,Weird and occultic,"Although Williams was a member of the Inklings group, the work of C.S. Lewis and Tolkein are worlds apart from Williams' writing. Finding any Christian reference takes work, but the occult is quite abundant. An understanding of his cult group (Knights of the Rose?--akin to the Masons) would have helped us decipher some of his meanings."
1,Very difficult read,"I had heard so much hype about this supposedly fantastic author and was hugely disappointed. I had to force myself to finish the book, unnecessarily wordy, taking away from the story line or moral message he was trying to get across. This made what could have been an interesting story a very boring story. It was just steeped w/ very heavy spiritual symbolism that you'd have to be Dante to figure out. I was embarrassed that I had recommended it for our Halloween pick for my book club. Of what use is a spiritual message if you can't even bring yourself to read it?"
1,Lowest book club score in a long time,"If I could have rated this book lower than 1 star, I would have done so in a minute! In the 6 years that our book club has been together, I can think of only one other time that we ALL disliked a book so completely. Specifically, we had trouble understanding the point of the book (other than good vs evil), found his writing to be pedantic, and his characters without depth. I chose the book for our October read, to tie it in with Halloween. I should have chosen Charlie Brown's Great Pumpkin!"
1,what a bore,"I agree with all the 1-star reviewers. Paragraphs never end, and Williams keeps saying the same things over and over again. The most interesting character was the little deformed 'dwarf woman' and the croaking sounds she made in lieu of speech. I scared myself trying to make sounds like she must have made. That was the worst scare this book gave me. Simon is a pretty lame excuse for pure evil. He is easily defeated, and he looks like an 'imbecile,' according to several characters and the author himself. There was not much to like about this book."
4,"Good, could be great","My 3 year-old daughter received this as a Christmas gift. The basket, canned goods, and produce pieces are very nice. The boxes, however, are very flimsy hollow cardboard and are showing wear after only three days of play, so I know they won't last long. At this price I don't expect wooden boxes, but solid cardboard construction would be a better design for the age range to which this set is marketed. My daughter likes this set very much, and I think it will give her lots of enjoyment while it lasts."
5,Makin' me hungry,"These little groceries are really great representations of real food products. The plastic cans are shaped just like real food but scaled down for little hands. The labels have great graphics, but the best is the pre-sliced foods that hold together with velcro and then can be ""sliced"" with a big plastic (cannot really cut) knife."
1,non supported item,The item is not suppurted by manufacturor. the old software works however trying to upgrade to new soft ware locks machine. i will never buy ati or amd hardware again.
3,Great Hardware / acceptable software,"The HD-TV card works great, the software will leave you wanting a little more. It pulls in over 16 channels where I live. All for free, and all in stunning HD quality!"
4,Works on Windows XP but not Windows XP MCE,"The card works on Windows XP systems. The picture looks great. Enjoy free HDTV!However, the card can't be recognized on Windows XP MCE even with patches from ATI and MS. Don't buy this card and waste your time if you only have MCE systems."
2,hdtvisgreat,"The tuner card from ati is great, but it is worthless with the software they package with it. The software would not load on my compac xt 1403wm. So I purchased an ati 1650 pro graphics card, which went in nicely also. The software would not load either. Nvidia to the rescue for graphics and beyondtv for the tuner card. This works great. Ati wants you to call them for loading their software, but a better idea is for them to create software that loads correctly from their cd rom. I will never buy ATI again. Ps: The ati uninstall did not work and I had to do an entire system recovery to remove it. Plan on 4 days work to recover from their software install."
2,Good start,"Once I got it working the picture was great. However, be sure to follow their instructions exactly; if you deviate from them it can take an hour or more to install all the drivers properly and get Windows to find all the components (it has 5 different devices in the device manager). Also, don't bother getting this if you have the 64 bit version of XP as ATI has almost no 64 bit drivers at all, and this was not one of the lucky few products to get one (nor is it planned; emailing Tech Support yielded a terse ""they don't exist""). No word yet on Vista drivers, but after this I wouldn't expect them any time soon."
1,ATI did it to me again...,The crad itself is great. I pick up all my local DTV/HDTV channels with no issues. The problem is the horrible software. It doens't even support titanTV! ATI has been knwon for poor drivers and applications. This hasn't changed. Steer clear of this steaming pile. Better yet stay away form ATI TV Tuner cards in general. My old card allowed me to use whatever codecs I have installed on my system. I bought DivX Pro and the sorftware for this card doens't recognise the DivX codec. I have sence thrown this thing away.
1,Save yourself trouble don't get this card,"After so many hours installed driver from cd and using driver download from ATI website, finally return this card back to Amazon. This card just don't work well, ATI online support are so bad can't find any info on error code."
1,hd tv loss signal,"The antenna supplied may not be so strong or I'm in a weak area, but I get a 'lost signal' often. This causes the picture and sound to freeze, annoying."
1,Do not buy,"I recently purchased an ATI 9550 video card and this HDTV card. My computer exceeds the system requirements for the use of the HDTV card but the DTV rarely works and when it does, the video is very choppy. I've talked to ATI tech support and their solution was to reinstall the software. I've probably done this 15 times and it has never worked. I've tried old drivers, new drivers, nothing works. Just simply trying to update the drivers for the ATI video card took weeks. Windows would not accept the most recent drivers for some reason. I've come to the conclusion ATI software is poorly written and I will never buy an ATI product again. I am continuously updating my computer and I've never had such a hard time getting a piece of hardware to work properly."
3,No Good Reception,"The first thing is if you live relatively far from the broadcast site (30+ miles), you will need to install an outdoor antenna, which is too much trouble if you ask me. I have to point out that this is in NOT the fault of ATI. And second if you can't wait and you want HDTV NOW! Get a Satellite system and a good, HDTV television. You will get true HDTV thru satellite, and 24 hours a day channels of HDTV, unlike the OTA channels which transmit only selected shows on HDTV. And I will like to point out, that this is NOT ATI's Fault. This is a good product, but please wait for OTA to get more content on High Definition, I guess in a couple of months, maybe... (12+). Have fun!"
1,HDTV WONDER NIGHTMARE,I spent days and nights trying to install this card on my computer even when my computer over pass all the hardware and software requirements. The image quality was not that good after all and the image also keeps flitting and freezing. I rather keeps watching my regular home TV and save the money and the frustration.
2,"Product ""ok"", support awful","I purchased several of these boards at once in order to watch HDTV from my PC. However, I've had some problems in using the boards and the company seems designed to make customer support difficult; the support web site does not work, with my having waste 1.5 hours in trying to type up a support incident ni several different ""interfaces""."
1,Horrible,About the only thing good I can say about this product is it did fit in the PCI slot. Software horrible. Crashed my system over and over. Never could get it to work.
2,ok for OTA but miss QAM,"I have used this one for a while (a year).Its analog TV is quite good. but analog TV is phrasing out so it's NOT the card's main feature.I rarely use its HDTV feature because three major reasons (drawback):1. the card gets frozen so often. need to reset many times if you watch HDTV while use your PC at the same time, which is common for normal PC users. the software is too buggy, as many users complained.2. No QAM receiver. the OTA signals at my home location are NOT very strong. I am comcast cable user. But this card won't take the QAM signal. I couldn't get what I want (OTA). and I couldn't use what I have (QAM). what a pity.3. the DTV is displayed on PRIMARY monitor only. I am using dual-monitor (two Dell 1905FP). the ATI card has no problem to display analog TV on either monitor but play DTV on PRIMARY only. I wish it could use the secondary monitor so that I could use primary monitor for my PC work."
3,Audio Nostalgia,"I'm giving this 3 stars because it's 1/2 a good album. I bought it out of nostagia for the song ""Halfway Down the Stairs,"" which I haven't heard in 20+ years. (The rest of the classic Muppet songs are good, of course, but that is my favorite track.) I could do without the songs from Muppet Wizard of Oz, which are mediocre at best, but put up with them to get the rest."
4,Great Fun !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"okay im going to be frank with you . I adore THE WIZARD OF OZ.It was my favorite story growing up , so naturally i was drawn to the MUPPETS WIZARD OF OZ.I was nervous , I mean what if they screwed up the story? Well , I said to myself if it turns out to be worthless at least Ashanti will sing and make it at least bareable.I was pleasantly surprised.It was imaginative witty and clever with cute acting , but one thing really drew me in - and that was the music.Okay we all know that Ashanti has a buttload of talent but wow ! She is really a gifted young lady.Every song she sings becomes gold , and they all have great upbeat tunes .While the muppets have enjoyable songs Ashanti was the highlight for me . I reccomend this album to anybody who enjoyed THE MUPPETS WIZARD OF OZ."
1,"poor excuse at a ""muppet"" movie","let's hear it for disney.they screwed up the entire spirit of the muppets on this movie, and on the recycled album.there is no more spirit of adventure or zany antics, just a stupid urbanized tale- but it does not work.the CGI was cheap, the songs were uninspiring, and the plot was expected.this record is 60% already released.whatever."
5,Small Circle of Friends,"Perhaps you will take my 5 star rating and review with a grain of salt but, as co-writer with Roger of ""I Can See Only You"" I was thrilled when I first heard the Small Circle of Friends version. As an old songwriter, it is one my favorite works, as is the whole CD. So, all I can say is, ""Give it a listen and decide for yourself.""The entire CD is a kind of soft-jazz/pop Classic, from the selection of songs to the arrangements and vocalizations of Roger, Murray and Melinda.Murray and I, (""Smokey Roberds""), with Jerry Riopelle, also wrote and recorded together, as The Parade, with Sunshine Girl, and others. What a blast from the past."
5,A piece of 60's Nostalgia,All I can say is that this is one of my favorite groups from the late 60's - and I was delighted to find the CD available!!!
2,"Enjoyable enough, but...","I'm totally half & half on this one. While the sound quality is excellent and music totally enjoyable, the electronic synth & drums (there's a no-no), give a totally modern, and doctor's office dated sound. Elevator pop at its very best. Enjoyable, but not what I was expecting, and would have preferred less electronics & more of the '60s sound, including the female vocals which seem to be lacking on this one. That was an essential part of their original sound!"
4,Good for a few chuckles.,"This book was easy to read and engaging. Her descriptive characters leaped off the page. I chuckled several times though this book. It did, however, seem that sometimes the full account was not there: As if she had left out some pertinent part of the story. This is my second time reading it and am enjoying it as much as the first."
5,So beautiful,"I agree with the other reviewer. This is an exquisite album -- perfect for wallowing in your breakup -- perhaps the most beautiful song is ""In stiller nacht"", she has the perfect voice for these songs -- but they are all very, very gloomy!!!!!!!!"
3,Great Conductors of the Third Reich,"I was actally puzzled by this DVD. On one hand everything what is presented hereis a treasure for any collector of historical recordings. The question is whatfrom this music is actually available. Here are mostly fragments too short fora listener to be able to get the picture of the conductor. I am pretty sure thata little more effort in research could have produced better results.Therefore, it looks to me that the selection was not done by a good, informed musician/musicologist. There definitely can be found better and longer (!)clips, esp. those by Furtwängler or Knappertsbusch (i am not saying these here are not valuable). On the whole,For the price this DVD looks almost like a rip-off."
2,Not the best on the subject,"This book is a slow read and not the most comprehensive or useful book on this topic. Mostly it covers massage and stretching. It goes over evaluation of the normal horse, identifying problems, preventing problems, massage, exercise therapy, and specific regimes for specialist disciplines. A specific regime is not included for jumpers. The massage section had lots of pictures and showed you, step-by-step, how to do it. Not worth it for me."
1,Better books on the subject,"This book is a ""What it is"" book rather than a ""How to and Why to do it"" book. The preface explains why: the author notes that in the UK it is ILLEGAL for horse owners to apply medical/specialized knowledge without the permission of a veterinarian. So- there is no detailed information, just a description of the problem and a description of the treatment. Not extremely useful."
5,Must have this if you are planning on nursing,This saved my back when I was nursing my baby girl! It is my favorite gift to give at baby showers.
5,Gift for a baby shower,The new mother was very happy to get her new Boppy pillow and I am sure she will enjoy it when her new little one arrives...thanksLeesleis@att.net
1,"Please define the word ""good""","This book wasn't good, it was rather boring and plain really...the writing style was average and could be found in any other book...the situations given were under average and could be found in any other dull book...this could have been a great book...just seemed over edited...if you know what I mean. A mere 100 or so pages just doesn't cut this out as a good book to read...another teenage heart throb book, just plainer and just plain boring. Just like cake without the icing and candles."
2,Unbelievable Book,"How could what had happened in this book have happened at all? This is what you really call a fictional book. I was enchanted with the summary of a teenager going through those akward years, but found this book to be more about babysitting a little kid, and dealing with the kid. For simple minded females, this may just be the book you're looking for"
4,Good overall,I thought this book was very good overall. the begining was boring but it got much better. It was a little short though. This book would probably be good for someone who just wants a short read. You might have to get past the boring begining though.
4,"Fits OK, installs easily",Requires self adhesive snaps to be installed on the grill which are a little ugly when the cover is off. But at least you dont have to drill holes. The cord for my block heater can reach through one of the velcro flaps in the center.Appears reasonably durable too.
4,A fast enjoyable read,"Letty Ellison returns home to her brother's ranch after being away for 9 years. She left to pursue a singing career which she chose over her boyfriend Chase. Now she's back with her daugher,(another man's child)and a secret.After all this time Chase is still angry and wants nothing to do with her or her little girl. Slowly tho, against his will, he finds himself drawn back under her spell. Will they be able to forget the past and confront the new problem that awaits them?There is also an amusing side story involving Letty's brother and his romantic misadventures.A perfect book for when you want some quiet time."
3,It was just an OK,"This is a very fast, easy read, but I found it a bit tedious. The story line was good, but it was drawn out to make it long enough to be a book."
5,Old School Fragrance with Soul,Amazon yet again you have delivered a product as promised and it is exactly what I wanted and needed and got it for a fair price well way below market price and what I would have paid in Macy's or Lord and Taylor....thank youCatalyst is one of my all time favorites and it still gets rave reviews from my family and friends....its clean and simple and masculine what more can you ask for?
5,My husbands favorite and mine,I love the smell of Catalyst it has a clean slight clove smell. My husband has been using this since we first met 10 years ago.
5,My favorite fragance,"Believe it or not, this is an old fragance (over 14 years old) and as time passes by it gets harder and harder to find them at retail locations.it has this unique ""citrous"" and very very fresh scentI bought two of them last time and I hope this thing sticks around for a long time."
4,Great Cologne at a Great Price,I first used this many years ago and then it became unavailable. I was happy to find it on Amazon.com. The price was about 1/3 of the original price and I received it timely in the condition advertised.
2,Distinct smell - but not one I like,"I chose this product based on other reviews. I already owned a light every day cologne, and I wanted to try getting something more distinctive.Catalyst is a distinctive smell. However, I didn't find it particularly appealing. I would describe it as a spicy, musky smell. I was hoping for a smooth masculine smell, but I got a sharp spicy smell. If you think you are the sort of person that would like a sharp spicy smell - this product is for you. If like me you do not find such an aroma appealing, then this product is not for you."
5,Catalyst By Halston For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 3.4 oz,Love this! My Man smells so wonderful wearing this! It's my favorite! Now I know where to find it again.. Took a ewhile :)
5,Experience the Flow for yourself,"In the Rivers' Flow is an honest and engrossing account of one boy's discovery of the world around him. Jake Rivers goes from an innocent boy to an aware young man before our eyes.Jim Ainsworth shows us the sometimes harsh reality of rural 50's East Texas in an unflinching way that never slips into the syrupy trap that most memoir/historical novels fall into. His keen observations and clean prose allow the reader to sink comfortably into the story, in much the same way that Rance Rivers explains the Flow, with plenty of time to look around and see it for the wonderful book it is."
2,Too jumbled and one-sided,"I had very high expectations for this book. I've read the author's work before (At Play in the Field of the Lords) and found it extremely impressive. I was also very interested in this subject. However, while this book is certainly exhaustive and detailed, I have two major complaints. First, I didn't think it was well written - the mass of information was not presented clearly enough. Second, the author presents the case in such a biased manner (he's just too cozy with AIM and its supporters) that it's hard to take all his arguments at face value. I found his overall bias undermined the detailed research. It's an interesting and difficult read, but ultimately a little disappointing."
2,Textbook Example,"Bestseller or no this thing reads with all the flair of a high school history book. Dry, brick-like text, whose only narrative flow seems to be the chronology of it's chapter heads. How you can take cowboys and indians, soldiers and cops, politics and injustice, and make them dull reading is a mystery, but here it is. Good stuff for your research paper I imagine but if you're looking for a page-turner you might find more craft in the FBI files."
5,yay!!!,"My book arrived early and in pristine condition! It's was hard to find this fantastic book in my local book shops, but they had them in stock on at Amazon!"
1,ridiculously one sided,"I am a history buff and appreciate well written history on any subject or event. I especially enjoy books that take a balanced or at least comprehensive look at the subject matter. I understand that most history texts have a point of view, regardless of how hard the author tries to be balanced and fair. This book did not even make the effort. I was ready to be persuaded either way the author, but instead came away feeling the same way i do when i listen to a lawyer is describing how great their client's case is. In fairness i read a fifth of the way through before i abandoned the effort. I purchased it (as an audiobook) because i had previously read the author's novel ""Killing Mr. Watson"" and enjoyed it immensely."
3,A little too jumbled,"While I appreciate the authors attempt to present all the facts, I found most of the book very complicated and difficult to follow. Detailing all of the arrests, trials, convictions, allegations,etc regarding all the major players( and some of the minor ones) in the movement at the time, while it served to present the climate in which Leonard's conviction took place, left me unable to form any opinion of guilt or innocence. It was not until the final 3 or 4 chapters that the whole thing made any sense . Still it is worth reading as it is the only book that I know of on a subject, unfortunately ignored by an American Public who had become somewhat jaded about protest movements and reports of wrong-doing by government agencies once the '60's had ended."
4,My favorite musician of all time,"I have had this disc for ages, as with many. I would bring them out and play my favorite cuts then put them away again. I began putting this music on my phone mp3 and found that my Kiss the Sky was lost. I am disappointed that Amazon does not have this in a downloadable format. I think my copy will turn up again sometime, but I want to put my 3 most favorite songs from it on my phone today and cannot. A note to Amazon; If you want to sell modern FM grade mainstream stuff, fine, but don't exclude the real music from the days when actual talent stood for something! I'll stick with quality over quantity and check back to see if the situation is corrected."
4,Import Ant Ambi Ant,"Too bad it's a lizard, and not an ant, featured on the album artwork, otherwise my stupid pun might make some sense. Anyway, I didn't realize I was getting the import version, but that's what I got, so I'm here to tell you that while there are some pretty good remixes here, the collection has its dull spots too, notably the 11-min.-plus dud ""Runaway"" on Disc 1. That's not a track to chill too, it just kills the disc dead, IMHO, even with The Primal Scream, Robbie Williams and Art of Noise fun mixes.Disc 2 is much more consistent, building to the excellent Damage Manual mix, followed by a properly-handled cool-down ""Morocco Mole"" from Yasuaki Shimizu, and capped off by a crazy/funny found/""enhanced""(?) novelty number, The Reefer Song.The whole 2-disc package is well worth it at the current stated price (under $15)."
4,A great book for discussion.,I think this book would make a good book for youth group type setting discussions. Each chapter has thought provoking ideas suitable for discovering one's own concept of the messiah found in all of us.
4,Rebuild your hair!,"I love this product. My hair was weak, breaking off, and baby fine. I couldn't get more than 4-5 inches before it would break. I finally got fed up with chemicals and went natural. But relaxers were only part of the problem. I did some reasearch and discovered that my hair was lacking protein. After trying this reconstructor, I discovered the strength in my hair. I use it 1-2 times a month (as needed), followed by a deep moisturing conditioner. One year after I started, I had hair 10 inches long. That might not be much to some ladies, but its a good deal to someone who has never had long hair. Additionally you have to condition...condition....condition. Treat hair gently and don't skip getting a trim for dead ends. I'm at 12 inches and going for 24. I can do it!!!"
3,"Enjoyable, if a little dated.","I got this book on my Kindle for a bargain price. It is a little dated, but I found it enjoyable and worth the price I paid."
5,LOVE it!,One of the best reads by Roger Ebert ever. A brilliant mind and an always insightful body of work. Highly recommend this one!
4,This book was very knowledgable!,"This book expanded my knowledge of movies. I know alot more now, than I knew before I picked up the book. Roger was sensational as usual! I recommended this book to one of my friends that is also a movie buff, and now it's in his collection too!"
1,Don't waste your time..,"I must say, I was totally disappointed by this book. Ebert is one of the few critics I agree with more times than not. After reading the reviews from other readers I was looking forward to the read even more. Well, I'm not sure what they were reading, but I find it hard to believe it was this book. I found most of Roger's answers condesending, sarcastic, off-point or a combination of the three. Sorry I wasted my time and money."
2,Not a lot new,"I had higher hopes for this book! Alas, not all were realized.We all know (and the author does fine background, in case we don't) that women are fairly easily derailed from career paths by family crises, discrimination, and just the logistics of daily life in America. So far, so good.The proposed ""solution"" is sad: Companies need to wake up and change their dated ways to retain talented women. The author seems to believe they (1) want to keep talented women and (2) will actually change to do so.As if."
1,stick with the first 3,"I didn't like this cd because, the sounds were to synthetic and the lyrics are not that profound either. Stick with the first 3."
4,A good sampler,"I picked this up at my university library to inform my classic children's library purchases - it was not disappointing. It contains well chosen extracts from 37 well known classic stories such as the wind in the willows, black beauty, the call of the wild and a Christmas carol. My only gripe is that the introduction by Humphrey Carpenter is not enough - I would have liked to see an introduction to each extract or perhaps some sort of categorization into adventure, fable or younger readers. Overall the selection is good and the extracts long enough to get a feel for the full text."
2,Not very comfortable,"I would like this leg rest better if it were straight across on the top. I couldn't get a green one, so I spray painted it and it came out great! The problem is because it's not comfortable no one will use it."
4,Definitive Superwoman,"This is the definitive karyn white album. LA and Babyface were getting there feet wet at the time and she became one of their first big successes. Veering from the make you dance ""secret rendezvous"" to the more mellow and verrry smooth ""slow down"". And also try on the romantic ""Love Saw It"". However, the highlight of this album and the one karyn will probably always be remembered for is ""Superwoman"", and deservedly so. When that hit came out every female I knew, myself included ran around singing that song--the anthem of the strong but not to be abused woman. Although some of the last songs are forgettable they don't detract from the overall flow of the album. A wonderful album altogether."
3,"Karyn ""Superwoman"" White's decent debut...","Karyn White's self-titled debut album showcases the singer's strong but sweet voice over the sounds of L.A. and Babyface. Hits such as ""The Way You Love Me,"" and ""Secret-Rendezvous,"" simply make you wanna dance. On the other hand, Karyn slows it down with her no. 1 hit anthem, ""Superwoman,"" also produced by L.A. and 'Face, a song about the independent female in a relationship. White also duets with Babyface on ""Love Saw It,"" which would also become a big hit. Karyn's voice + LaFace sound = pop classics never to be forgotten."
4,Great Artist!!!,I started love this voice from 'superwoman'.Powerful but soft.I hope everybody would hear this song then you will like it very very much!
2,Not as promised,This product was listed as very good and when received there is a defect in the cd. I like the music but it's difficult to enjoy a song with a scratch in it.
3,pretty good,"this disc is pretty good.i like secret rendezvous,superwoman,& the great duet with Babyface Love saw it.the production&writting of La&Babyface are the highs here."
3,Funky 90's R&B,"Well, All I can say is I LOOOOOOOOVE this album! This is the album I always play when I am feeling high on love!If you don't have this album,stop whatever you are doing and buy this! The album goes through all phasesof love and realtionships.I love the way you love is my favorite. I always reminisce of doin' the cabbage patch and the snake and all those dances from the 90's.Just a great album start to finish!"
5,Miss White,Miss White is a cross between Whitney and Jody Watley with a bit more r&b involved. The female Bobby Brown. Funky dance with good love songs. Good artist.
1,AMAZON ARE STILL MISLEADING YOU !,"I bought a copy of this some months ago when it had the picture of the ORIGINAL ELECTRIC BLUE #2 featuring Desireee Cousteau. Needless to say, I ended up with the pathetic MODELS FILE #2 and eventually got my money back after both I and the supplier complained to AMAZON that it had misrepresented the item AND AMAZON ARE STILL DOING IT! There is no Desireee Cousteau in this DVD, it is ELECTRIC BLUE MODELS FILE #2 and is NOT as described in the listing. Do not be fooled - demand a refund if you bought this item after being misled by the description."
1,FOOLISH HATE-FICTION,"It is well documented that the Catholic Church, and Pope Pius, in particular, saved thousands of Jews from execution. Many Israelis have nominated the Pope for recognition as a ""Righteous Gentile."" Read the letters of the Chief Rabbi of Israel, Isaac Herzog, praising the Pope. Read the books of the Chief Rabbi of Rome, Eugene Zolli.Thus, this movie is transparent nonsense. Revisionist fiction writers and haters of the Church have recently fabricated ""new facts"" with which to criticize Pope Pius. In no way is this movie based on a ""true story,"" however, it is powerful evidence of the last acceptable prejudice and hatred in the Western World: Anti-Catholicism."
1,One star for Amazon's misrepresentation of this DVD,"Regardless of the merits of the film itself and the importance of the subject matter potential buyers of this DVD need to be alerted to the fact that, contrary to Amazon's blurb above, it is *not* presented in the original language. It is dubbed into English with a variety of often incongruous accents. There are no other language tracks and no subtitles.Perhaps for many viewers this is not an imporatnt consideration, but for those who wish to watch the film in its original form, it is available from Amazon.de under its original title ""Der Stellvertreter (The Deputy)"". The German DVD includes an English soundtrack for those who prefer it, but also a German soundtrack with German subtitles."
4,Interesting Aspect of Holocaust History,"This beautifully filmed moralist story of an SS Officer and a Catholic priest is based on the play THE DEPUTY. It starts out slowly, so conditioned have we become to Holocaust recreations, but the human conflicts eventually set this work apart and keep the viewers' interest in this woefully underreported aspect of WWII history. Fine performances, direction and production design highlight AMEN. The audio soundtrack and score, however, are not up to par with the rest of the film... the recurring ""train"" theme is irritating and amateurish; the rampant voice-over dubbing is also distracting and often difficult to understand.As far as the bonus materials found on the DVD, there isn't much there...but the ""Making Of"" documentary has several interesting moments."
4,Overall a great film,"This is a great film, a must have for anyone who is interested in World War II and the holocaust. It provides a different perspective and story than most World War II/Holocaust movies which is why I enjoyed it so much. The reason why it only got 4 stars by me is because it is a very long movie and can get a little slow at times. But having said that, it is a great movie, the story is enthralling, sad, and unique. It is a great addition to any history buff's DVD collection."
4,"EXCELLENT FILM, BUT THIS DVD VERSION HAS A FEW FLEAS","My big issue with this DVD version is the lack of a original language soundtrack and proper English subtitles. The only reason i removed one star from the review is for the soundtrack issue. After all this is really a product review, not a movie review. to many customers forget that. As far as the film goes. I found it very interesting, well acted and had above average production standards. Will you like it ? Well that is subjective to taste and interests . I happen to enjoy historical period pieces."
5,"Just ""ok""","This is a ok monitor for daily use. Not something I would personally purchase. I have a friend with one, and have used it several times over at his place."
2,Disappointment,"I bought this item for the automatic time update. Unfortunately, this feature does not work in my area despite the fact that the company says it has tested the clock all over the U.S. and Canada. I called their customer service and, besides being rude, they could offer no explanation. They suggested I try moving the clock to a different area of the house. This did not work and would have been unsatisfactory anyway since I bought this as a bedroom alarm clock. The LCD display can not be read clearly if viewed from any angle other than almost head on. The display may also be too bright for some and can only be turned off, not dimmed."
3,Cool features that almost make it a winner,"I purchased the clock about 5 months ago, mainly for the automatic time keeping. That has worked fine for me. Here are my other thoughts:Pro's: Nice features. Nap timer is good. Sound is okay.Con's: Display is absolutely lame. I turn it off since I can't see it anyway. 5 (or 6) minute snooze is also a drag. I guess they really want me to get up! I will never buy another alarm clock that doesn't have an adjustable/extendible snooze. (I just bought a Sony Dream machine and it has this. Hit the bar once - 10 minutes. Twice - 20 minutes, etc.)Neutral: Working with the clock is not intuitive, but it isn't rocket science either. Keep the manual around."
3,Some drawbacks,"First, the good part:-The radio part is very good. Both reception and user interface to the tuner are good.- the atomic clock works fine even in CaliforniaThe bad:-The display. An LED display would be much better. You can turn on illumination, but I wonder how long the lamp will last. Also, the LCD is almost invisible if your eyes are at the same level of below the display. Very poor design- a simple way to turn the two alarms on and off is missing. Just pushing the corresponding button should turn the alamrs on or off."
3,Love it and hate it,"TERRIFIC radio reception for a clock radio, and lots of clever conveniences, although reading the manual is a must. However...The display is dreadful. The background is a rectangle of amber light. There's no way to dim it and it really can't be ignored in a dark room. Furthermore, the digital display is more gray than black and not particularly easy to read. The light can be turned off but then there's no possible way to read it in a dark room.Can anyone suggest another clock radio with especially good radio reception?"
3,A bit disappointing,"First the good news. It really does keep very good time. And, I like how the alarm starts off very softly and then gets gradually louder. No more getting blasted awake. The nap feature is also nice.Unfortunately, they outweigh the negatives. My biggest complaint is that the readout is impossible to read unless you are almost perfectly level with the clock face. If I'm lying in bed, I can't make out the numbers unless I get to just the right angle.You can designate which days the alarm will go off but you can't set different times for different days."
2,not up to expectations,could not figure out how to set the alarm... too many buttons.sound was excellent... too bad we had to send it back.
5,Love this clock,"This gets great reception on FM, love the atomic clock feature, and dual alarm. Good price, too. I wish the alarm was a bit easier to understand, though. I also wish it was easy to cancel an alarm before it sounded. but overall, I would order this product again and again."
3,Good but could be better,"The radio plays well. It also was easy to set up. The angle to view the time display has to be ""dead on"" with the face of the clock. Any other angle and the display washes out. Also you can not turn off the alarm if you chose to,without resetting it. Mike"
4,Clock radio am-fm,"Very nice product. Has all the features of more expensive radio's at half the price. The Atomic Clock feature is great, especially in an area where power loss often occurs. I enjoy both am and fm broadcasts, and if any improvement could be made they could consider making the am antenna more sensitive, especially after 6pm until 6am. Overall, I'd purchase it again, I am pleased."
5,Great radio performance. Easy to use.,"I use this as a bedside radio and alarm. I listen to it using an under-the-pillow speaker (so I can stay married).It fills these needs perfectly. The radio sensitivity is fantastic. I have a bunch of radios and this by far works the best - it really surprised me how well the radio works. My previous radio - which is actually a SW-AM-FM-LW radio which was not cheap has worse FM performance than this radio. It has 3.5mm earphone jack, so it works with the under-the-pillow speaker. And it has a 120 to 15 (in steps of 15) timer. You need to turn on the light to read the time at night - I like this, since I am not subjected to an LED display all night otherwise. The buttons are pronounced, so it is easy to feel for them in the night.So - all in all - it is excellent. And as a bonus, the atomic clock works great for me and set in a short time (I left and came back to it completely setup)."
1,disappointing given the price,Electronic tunning is poor - I can hear multiple stations simultaneously. After any power interuption it takes about a day to get a signal for the automatic time adjustment.
1,Glad to get rid of it,The RCR-2 is terrible..we could not get the Alarm to ring or have the radio go off the way we wanted..one day it would buzz but not on the on the correct staion mext it would go off on FM when set to AM. It did or did not do whatever you can think of. Maybe I had a bad one or maybe I'm too stupid to follow the instructions. Two of us --one reading step by step and the other person hitting the settings...no luck...
2,Sangean Digital Clock Radio,"Somewhat disappointed. Digital information on the face is unreadable unless you facing it directly. Any angle and the face is totally washed out. The back light it way too bright. Of course you can turn it off, but that makes it useless to see at night. Also too many images on the face that are unnecessary. I don't know who designed or tested this, but they didn't do a very thorough job. Again -- disappointed!"
2,"Good functions, poor display","This clock has great functionality as far as the dual alarm settings and radio presets go, but the display is, in my opinion, absolutely terrible. The display is a back-lit LCD with very thin number segments, making it very hard to read from more than a few feet away, especially at night. This is really unfortunate, because otherwise the Sangean seems to be a great product. The atomic clock synchs up to the NIST time signal very quickly (I've had other 'atomic' clocks take a long time), and it is very easy to program."
4,High Function in Small Package,"This replaced a much larger Brookstone dual-alarm clock/radio/CD. It does almost everything we'd want (short the CD wake up) in a much smaller, better looking package. The radio reception is fabulous and it bring in stations clearly that we really didn't get before.It has so many options for the wake up that I've kept a one-page printout handy until I've memorized which buttons to push in which order.This is superior to what we have used for years."
3,"Full featured, but drawbacks","There's a lot to like about this clock, but unfortunately it has a few problems. As others have said, the display is either too light or too dark. The manual lists snooze time as 5 min, but it's actually 6 minutes(!). That's way too short for me. Most clocks are 9-10 minutes, I'd probably prefer 15. It has lots of buttons, and a not very intutitive setup. Still, it's nice looking, syncs up pretty quickly for me (not hours), and has a nice day-of-the-week alarm schedule."
4,A very good clock radio,"This is, all in all, a very good but not excellent clock radio. It's easy to set up and works as promised. The alarm set and shut off are a little complex and the back light is too bright for use at night but can be shut off entirely. In general I'm pleased with it."
4,Good clock radio,"I really like this radio. The reception is good and there are lots of nice features. Maybe it's because my old alarm clock was a piece of junk, but I feel spoiled with this one. I do have to read the instructions every time I want to do anything with it though, hence the 4 instead of 5 star rating. It isn't exactly intuitive to use but overall is good quality."
2,Pain To Program,"Based on a number of things I'd read, I thought this clock would be much easier to use than it is. The off button is hard to hit when one is just waking and it's still dark, it does more than one really needs (you can customize the alarm for every day of the week). My guest room now has a fancy clock however..."
4,Radio,"The radio has awsome sound and is easy to use. It would be great if it has battery backup but I guess it does reset the time when electricity goes out. It is very hard to read the time in the dark, you have to get right next to the radio to see the time."
3,"Good radio, not so good instructions","The tuning and sound of this radio are great. The light could be brighter, although some reviewers stated it is too bright. The instructions for how to set up the alarms, etc. are not very clear. I still have only one alarm set and don't know how to set it so it doesn't go off on the weekend. All else has failed so I'll take another shot at the instructions. I still like it enough to buy it again should something happen to this one."
4,"A nice alarmclock radio, but...","The Sangean is a nice compact radio. Considering it's size, the sound is very good. It accesses, even in the fringe area where I live, many FM stations (I am not listening to AM). The ""but"" is the complex set-up of the wake-up etc. system. A better guide book with larger and clearer graphs might help. Also the back-lit face though clear from a frontal view is barely visible from the sides. Would I buy it again? Yes, it seems to be one of the better alarm clock radios available."
2,sangian atomic clock,It's fine except that you can't see the time if you are not right in front of the clock. The numbers are to faint.
1,"Poor Design, Time/Date washed out","It's the same as other reviews, CAN NOT see the time/date at night, LED background washes out the time/date. All they had to do was make the time lines 2 or 3 times thicker. Also, the radio can not pick up any FM stations (my old cheap alarm clock picked them up).I bought the clock for the automatic time update and dual alarm (I use the buzzer anyway). It's weird the later it gets the lessyou can see the display (when you wake up in middle of the night trying to see the time, forget it, you can stare at it for 5 minutes and you still won't see the time (we had the clock about 6 feet away, then moved it to 2 feet away still the same thing). I hope who ever designed/tested this clock was fired."
4,Sangean RCR-2 Digital Atomic Clock Radio with Dual Alarms,"Worked to specs. I am married and my wife often needs different alarms. These work well, I would hope in the future someone could add a bunch more ""alarms"" for a product."
1,Disappointed,This clock was a bust. It would not keep time accurately and the headphone jack broke in the first two weeks. The radio reception was good but the quality is just not there. I threw it away after two months.
1,Dead on arrival,Can not turn on power. It is dead on arrival. The bad thing is I forgot to return it - total lost
1,Broke after 2months,"High hopes, big let down. Worked great for two months and it totally broke, volume doesn't work at all. Sadly I am outside of return window and I am stuck with this paperweight"
5,Just what I wanted,"I love this clock radio! It's beautifully designed and easy to set up and operate. It's lightweight, yet stable. The digital display is easy to read and the alarm has nice features such as allowing you to set a different wake-up time for each day of the week. The alarm sound is one of the examples of how well thought-out the design is: it starts out single-beat and soft, and gradually increases in volume and becomes double-beat. The radio sound is excellent, as is the reception. The atomic clock feature is wonderful, as I now have one clock in the house that can be depended upon to give the correct time! Seldom have I seen a modestly-priced product with so much thought put into its design."
3,Good product.,"The radio has many features - set each day of the week differently, pick a radio station, etc. Good features, but takes awhile to figure it all out. My only complaint is that there is no battery back-up."
3,Good but has issues,"An ""o.k."" purchase. Too confusing for my husband so we are going to buy a different clock radio.Pros-Sleek design-Atomic clock-dual alarm with different settings per alarm-nap setting-nice sound-progressive alarm if desiredCons-Atomic clock does not work everywhere. Could not get it to pick up a strong signal in the area of the bedroom that we keep our radio.-Too confusing. You have to use multiple buttons and multiple combinations of button pressing to set the alarm.-Display is TOO bright. And you only get the chance to turn it on or off; no progression of display light. We turn the display away from us otherwise the bright light distrupts our sleep."
3,Convenience at a price,"It takes a while to program this clock radio. You set up the time you want to wake up each day of the week, then never have to touch it except to turn it off in the morning, which is convenient. The problem is that if you should want to change the time for any given day it seems a bit complicated to silence or change it for that day. The button to shut off the alarm at wakeup time is easily located for me. The lighted screen is impossible for me to see without my glasses. I solved that by buying a large-letter alarm clock which I have placed next to it. My new setup is far more expensive than the Radio Shack clock radio that I used for years. I could see the time and it was easy to change my wakeup time but I had to remember to set it at night."
3,Sangean Atomic Clock Radio,"The radio is basically a good item in that the size, the sound, digital display and alarm settings can be given an excellent rating. The only fault that I find with the radio is that it lacks a battery backup facility. This short-fall of the radio should have been explicitly stated in the description of the item. Had this been the case, I would not have purchsed the radio since electrical failures are quite prevalent in my area and exceed the one hour backup system of the unit's settings."
1,Alarm DIFFICULT to SET and/or Change!!,I absolutely HATE it!! I was really happy when I ordered it ... but since that time every time I have to deal with the alarm features (setting/changing)it is very very frustrating. Each time I have to get out the book ... which overall doesn't really help at all.I am going to probably (unless I find a rocket scientist to set it each time) throw it away ending up eating the $60 (approx.) I spent for it. I would try to return it to Amazon but I no longer have the box and whatever else would be required to return it.What a DISAPPOINTMENT and COSTLY MISTAKE!!
2,Doesn't switch automatically for DST,"The whole reason I bought this clock so it would switch to and from DST automatically. It doesn't. Or at least it takes several days for it to pick up the change. This wouldn't be so bad, unless you are one of the rare individuals who works on Monday or Tuesdays.The display is either way too bright or impossible to read."
1,Invisible Clock,This clock radio might be feature rich but is sure UNREADABLE!! The display is very poor especially when you first wake up in the morning and your eyes are not fully adjusted. The LCD display is very hard to see unless you tilt the clock to the right angle.I used the clock for one day (night) and pulled it out! My old one is back on my night stand!
1,Disappointed,"I have had my Sangean RCR-2 for over a month now and a 30 count beeping sound goes off every day at 6:30AM, every day and on time. The problem is, there is no alarm setting that should set this off. Alarm-1 is set to 6:59AM while alarm-2 is not set but with a 9AM time just in case. (I know how to set them per instructions) I've pressed ""reset"" button for three seconds without turning this nuisance alarm off. The reset turns all other settings off, or to default.The other problem is readabiltiy. I place the radio on a slightly elivated dresser and cannot read the time while laying down in bed. It can only be read if you are at or close to the same elevation.Also the brightness at night is a problem. Too bright. Only one setting. On or off."
2,Electrical items not always what they seem,"I bought a digital clock radio through Amazon for my wife who was wanting a digital radio. I assumed a little naively that this is what she wanted. When it arrived, it turned out to be a digital clock with a standard radio. For the price it was reasonable so we were happy. The item, however was from the USA and could not be used in Australia. US mains power runs at 115 volts. Australian is 240 volts. Voltages differ from country to country and I expected that a large business would have been aware that an electrical appliance must be appropriate for the country of use.While there is the safety net of return of purchases, it cost me $53 to send it back - about the cost of the item itself.Take care when buying electrical items - ask questions if you can't find information on the voltage. Standard adaptors don't alter the voltage, they just change the shape of the power plug."
1,Don't waste your money,"Even though this item isn't alot of money initially, once you pay shipping, the product isn't worth the cost. The two pieces of the ""adjustable"" pole won't go together properly, so it's not only not adjustable - it won't stand up straight. The set screws that fasten the top and bottom onto the poles are microscopic. I guarantee no one has a phillips screwdriver that small, but even then, the screws are too large for the holes provided! I would have sent it back, but didn't want to invest even more. Skip this one!"
2,"Better than nothing, but not much.","I wanted a hair dryer stand that would hold my hair dryer up level with my head and leave both my hands free for styling. Unfortunately, this stand was not the right choice. If you want to sit down while you are drying your hair and you have a hair dryer that weighs next to nothing, you may be able to work with this.I use a Conair dryer that is not that heavy, but the flexible neck on this stand is weak and won't hold the dryer up. The stand itself has to sit on a chair or table if you want the hair dryer level with your head. The pole keeps coming out of the base anytime you move it. I'm sure there is something better out there. Just keep looking."
4,hair saver,i love this stand and the price is great only wish it was taller must use on table or counter. but i am able to use 2 hands for drying hair much faster and hair comes out smoother. good product easy to assemble.
3,Helps a little...,"As the other reviewers have already mentioned, this product is a TOTAL of 3"", the usable space is actually much smaller. I was a little disappointed to find that it would really only hold one item. The worse part to me was the fact that it did not fit in my cabinet! The shelf I have was too thick, so I had to struggle to get it on. Once on, the door wouldn't even come close to shutting. In addition, if the item is too heavy, the tray begins to bend. It is not a bad item IF you know exactly what you want to use it for, and you measure that item AND your cabinet to make sure it will work for you before you order it. For me, I just didn't get as much use as I hoped out of it."
5,Perfect,"I have long been wondering how to store all my platters without stacking (and thus chipping) them. This is the perfect solution! It frees up room in the cabinets also. After purchasing the first one, I have ordered several more to store all my platters. Genius idea!"
4,Under shelf platter holder,"I thought the available space for the platter would be 3"" high, but instead I found that the entire product was 3"" high - so it meant that my thicker platters didn't fit. Other than that, it is a good space saver in my space limited kitchen."
4,Rhyme Pays Every Night and Day,"This CD put Ice T on the map. Squeeze the Trigger was a personal favorite of mine, this CD doesn't have any fillers. And thats saying something given Ice-T's limited artistic capability.Note that this CD is an analog to digital recording, given the time frame in which it was produced. Still, the dynamic transfer is very good with very little background noise.This CD should be in every Ice-T fan collection, and in the collection of a classic West Coast rap fan as well."
1,NOT original recordings!!!,"i had this tape when i was in jr. high and IT RULED! i thought id replace my lost tape with a cd. WRONG. is this a remix or something? if youre looking for old school ice-t, dont waste your money on this."
2,Poor debut LP from the best Gangsta Rapper of all time,"Disregard this album; do not even THINK of picking it up. It's only notable for Ice's precursor to 'Colors', entitled 'Squeeze the Trigger.' Tape the one tune from a friend then forget about the rest."
3,"Good plot, fresh characters, boring writing.","I think that the plot was great. I think that the plot could've gone anywhere! That he has a life now that could include anything... But his writing style.. so many times I had put the book down, and wondered if I should pick it back up. Luckily I am stubborn. There were some parts that weren't even really believable, especially the parts about Rick."
4,Classic Cure,"In 1982, The Cure released the brilliant Pornography - one of the most agressively unhappy albums ever recorded. How do you possibly follow up such an album? With a series of poppy and often goofy singles, of course! Japanese Whispers collects those singles and their b-sides together, and it makes for a fascinating and entertaining listen.Japanese Whispers is a must-have, if just for ""The Upstairs Room,"" one of my all-time favorite Cure songs. It deserves to be right along side the classic singles included here. ""Let's Go To Bed,"" ""The Lovecats"" and ""The Walk"" are the Cure at their best, and the other material is not too shabby either, especially ""Just One Kiss."" It's all vintage 80's Cure, and worth picking up."
2,Disco cure?,Whether this is truly disco or not..i didnt really enjoy it. for some reason this style of Cure doesnt work out for me. I seem to think that too many die hard robert smith fans place biased reviews on amazon. Just because I like the cure doesnt mean I am obligated to enjoy every album...this album is indeed one i would avoid.
2,Disagree with Sandman,"I remember many nights listening to (...) and waiting for the next Cure album...When the Let's Go to Bed singel was first released, I ran out, bought it, put it on and was stunned...it was one of the coolest songs I have ever heard them do...then I realized that I was listening to ""Just One Kiss"" which was the B-Side (it was one of those photo on one side, info on the other singles), still in my euphoria, I put the flip side on and gagged....every other fan of the Cure that I knew at the time pretty much gagged as well-----when ""The Top"" was released, we pretty much wrote the cure off (just as we did with Gang of Four after ""Hard"" and Killing Joke after ""Outside the Gates"" - While I still feel ""Just One Kiss"" is right up there with Charlotte sometimes as one of their best songs, La Ment is really the only other track worth a listen on this piece of drivel.....I will never forget how terrible I felt about one of my favorite bands turning to crap....."
4,"""Pop"" Cure","This LP is a very different turn for Robert & Company. After the very gloomy ""Seventeen Seconds"", ""Faith"", and ""Pornography"" LPs. The three singles ""Let's Go To Bed"", ""The Walk"", and ""Love Cats"" (my fav of the three!) are all excellent! Very fun and playful. My favorite song the LP though is ""LaMent"" it's very different from the rest of the songs, and in the same area as the doom and gloom Cure of their previous three albums. I'd say it's a must buy for all Cure fans though!"
4,an important book,I've struggled with depression and anxiety for years and felt guilty about it because black women are taught that such things only happen to weak people or to whites. This old folk tale has ruined countless lives and came close to killing me. And then I found this book. It was the first inkling that my problems didn't stem from weakness or lack of character but was a genuine illness. I've since got up the courage to see a therapist and I'm doing better than I ever have before and it all started because I happened to see this book on the library shelf.
4,spy games,"this was a movie I've watched more then once to really understand. I feel that Robert Redford and Brad Pitt gave a very solid performance. And if you like moves you need to think through you'll like this, we did."
3,Not as clever as it's meant to be...,Robert Redford and Brad Pitt try to out-blonde and out-handsome each other in this muddled spy thriller. Did someone cut out the twenty minutes during which the plot makes sense and we care at all about any of the characters? Guess so.
3,For Fans of Brad Pitt,"I was drug in by a couple of friends and boredom. This movie is definitely for fans of Pitt or perhaps fans of Redford. I suppose I was looking for a little more intrigue: something like Behind Enemy Lines meets Mission Impossible. It didn't happen.The flashbacks were a little disjointed and seemed to make the movie drag a little bit. I guess it was supposed to develop a kind of dad/son thing; it didn't really win me over. I liked the previous work of Pitt/Redford in a River Runs Through It -- although that picture had some extraneous and slow moving sections too.Like I said, Brad Pitt fans will see it just for the skin and actor charm, but viewers looking for a well crafted movie ought to keep looking."
2,The CIA Meltdown because of a girl??,"All you need to know about this movie (horribly overdirected as usual by the insecure Tony Scott) is that all the gyrations, life risking moves by so called ultraintelligent guys is as a result of one's love for a girl who seems to be a leftist terrorist sympathizer....in other words, this moview makes no sense."
1,didn't get the dvd,"didn't get get the dvdi call in the middle of october to fix the problem and they didn't.now, more than a month after i suppose to get the dvd still don't get a solution"
1,Great movie but DVD is a real problem.....,"As the other reviewers mentioned, there is no way to turn off the close captioning for the hearing impared. It is annoying - we turned the movie off after 20 minutes and spent another hour trying to turn off the close captioning. Must be a DVD design flaw but why did not one notice this?Alas, the movie is a clever affair with many twists and turn and I enjoyed seeing it in the theater. Hopefully they will release a corrected DVD soon."
5,What's NOT to like?,"Not that anyone else hasn't already said this: but good looking guys, international spies and a thriller plot - what beats that? i could watch this movie over and over and not get bored. Love it!"
4,awesome,"incredible actions scenes and acting. the filming style is very modern and artistic. awesome movie, funny and entertaining."
1,"Good movie, Bad DVD","The movie was above average, but the technical difficulties with the DVD were unacceptable. The captioning turns itself on many times during the movie and is so distracting that I returned the DVD. Based on other reviews, it is apparent that the problem is not isolated to my particular DVD. Considering the problems associated with this product, I'm surprised that it hasn't been pulled from the market."
4,I Liked It!,"I thought this was a thinking persons movie. If you're looking for action, don't look here. But if an intellectual movie is your cup of tea, by all means check this one out. By the way I have the wide screen version not the full screen as indicated earlier."
1,Have they heard of testing the products?,"I have that same caption issue as everyone else; and it's not the normal subtitles, either. That, I could deal with.These are all over the screen.Someone at Universal screwed up, methinks, and I won't be keeping this DVD. It takes a lot for me to return one, but I can't stand watching it [I, too, had to switch and watch it on a cheesy early model rca].I'll bet it would be a good movie, but, ewwww. Were they trying to make them distracting?"
3,Not bad,"I enjoyed this movie more than I thought I would; I really love action films, but the trailers just didn't grab me for this one. I'm also not especially fond of Robert Redford, but I did like him in ""Spy Game."" This is a war-buddy film, and it's somewhat predictable; at one point relatively early on, Redford makes a statement about Never Ever Doing A Certain Thing, No Matter What, and No Matter For Whom, whereupon you immediately know that this will likely happen. Still, despite the blase cinematography and almost complete lack of color in the film (which I realize is of course deliberate,) I did enjoy it more than I thought I would."
4,Better Than Your Average,"In general, ""Spy Game"" is a pretty standard Hollywood espionage flick. The plot is improbable, the dialogue a little overdetermined, many of the characters [typical]. Yet, despite its faults, I find it to be quite a bit better than the average spy flick. The set-up in itself is interesting: Robert Redford's character becomes something of a spy within the CIA; the line between good guy and bad guy is not so easily drawn here. The script is merely serviceable, but the film creates an adrenaline-soaked atmosphere through its jumpy camera-work and unexpected ... twists. Unlike most action movies, it gives you something to think about, a ... situation to consider and question. Plus, how many big Hollywood flicks have a juicy, sly Charlotte Rampling cameo? That in itself deserves credit."
3,"not ""Sneakers'","Much of this movie takes place inside C.I.A. headquarters.The movie is about a retiring field supervisor and hisfavorite operative: Tom Bishop ( code named boy scout).The movie reminds me ofHopscotch - Criterion Collection.The new generation of spies always think theyare better at it. Leaving the guys from the cold warout on a limb just has moral complications.I liked the choir boys singing touchas the movie winds down at the end.A lot of action and dirty tricks over a time span ofabout 20 to 30 or so years from 1975 on.The trouble is that these days we seem to beas bad or worse than the guys we are fighting.Seizing the day, the hero walks away empty but cleaner?"
2,Nothing special with Spy Game,"Unfortunately Redford, although an incredible actor can also hit a wall now and again. I found this film to have a large concentration on conversations that were supposed to be meaningful in regards to the mentoring ability of Redford's character. Instead it ends up being just talk, and at times almost seems to appear as if it has no real purpose. They would have been better off finding some real former spies and making a film based off of those experiences instead of the dull, boring effect that this thing emits. Really just could not find anything good in it, and although it has a great cast, the roles they fill are just that...filled, but not enough to make this film have any rewatchable value."
4,Redford and Pitt are fabulous,"Spy Game is a great spy thriller with a real satisfying conclusion. The film keeps you guessing at Redford's Nathan Muir ""plays"" the CIA to help out Pitt. A quality film."
2,I Went To See This Moovy....,"...but I can't remember anything about it for the life of me, except that Redford looked craggy-faced and tired, in my opinion,and Pitt was a lil less goofy in this story. Many times the actors in a moovy would keep me 'into' a story I consider to be dull, otherwise. It did not do it for me this time...."
1,Am I the ONLY one??,I can't even concentrate on this movie with the stupid closed captioning popping up every 10 seconds. I keep turning it off and it just keeps comin' on back. Is there something I've missed here? I've exchanged it twice already...this is ridicules.As far as the movie goes....I couldn't get past the huge white block letters blocking the screen...so I have no comment.
2,Bad DVD Design Implementation,"Apart from the narrative of the film (which I really enjoyed), the technical design of the DVD (the menus, intro clips, bonus material, soundtracks, etc.) was quite frustrating. For the intial DVD viewing, all the film montage multimedia effects involved in navigating the menus was somewhat entertaining. But, after the initial viewing, all this repeated material felt like a force-feeding. Also, the design of the soundtracks prevents the viewer from changing the languages/surround sound/director's commentary/subtitles at will through standard DVD controls. Instead, one must always go back to the overly elaborate menus (more film montage repeats) for any simple change, which quickly becomes quite tedious. Lastly, I would like to mention that the so-called ""Alternate Ending"" is identical to the ""Theatrical Release Ending"" with the exception of different background music. Certainly not worth buying for the ""Alternate Ending"" bonus material."
3,Not too bad if you love Redford and Pitt,"This movie was fun to watch, and had some interesting plot twists; however, what made this movie seem even more far fetched than other spy thrillers is the fact that the movie makes the CIA look like a bunch of idiots and the only smart and clever one is 24 hours from retirement.I also have to agree with one of the reviewers about the fact that Redford and Pitt look exactly the same throughout the entire movie despite there being scenes from fifteen to twenty years in the past.I thought the movie was a bit slow and that the ending came a little fast, but I found it entertaining enough to hold my interest for the 127 minutes it lasted."
3,Entertaining but predictable,"This is a good movie for a night when you want to be entertained, but don't want to have to think a lot. This movie is predictable, but gives interesting insight into the strategies of being a spy. The format of the movie is a present story-line with Robert Redford's character going back to memories of his meeting and training ""Boyscout"" (Brad Pitt's character). Something that adds interest to this film is the fact that it takes place on the last day of work at the CIA for Redford's character. I could take it or leave it."
1,Unable to stop captioning,"I think I could have enjoyed this movie if the captioning would stay turned off. After turning captioning off through the menu, it only stays off for a couple of minutes. Thought the first DVD was defective and returned it. The second one is doing the same thing. I decided to research this and found that it is a known problem--mostly with Toshiba players (which I have). I own other DVDs with captioning that do not turn on automatically."
3,YOu really must pay attention to this one...,"otherwise you'll get lost. There are a lot of flashbacks, fast edition, fast dialogues.But the result is a film that makes you think, not s stupid action thriller full of plot holes.Tony Scott uses his trademark skills here, mainly in the action sequences. It's great.The main flaw, in my opinion, where the main characters themselves. The guys are plain killers. Ok, some may say hard times nedd hard decisions, but the fact is that one can simply not care about the characters. If Pitt's character (Tom Bishop) was executed in that Chinese prison, I would not lose my sleep. The same goes for if Redford'c character (Nathan Muir) was get by his CIA mates."
4,Nice Film just like Sneakers,"Pitt and Redford together it happend for the second time.It's great fun to see those actors in this movie.Spy Game has much thriller skills and sometimes my mind goes back to the movie Sneakers.Redford playing the mentor of Pitt, shows he is still able to compete with the younger generation.Pitt's acting grows to a huge level.What made this film great is to see both actors from a different history."
3,"Good movie, but possible DVD technical problems","Apparently some DVD players will display closed-captioning (very annoying since it's in about 1000-point type) every time a scene changes on this DVD. We tried two different copies from Blockbuster (happened on the store's player as well), as well as a purchased copy. It happened every time. A friend tried our purchased copy, and it didn't happen. His DVD player was new last Christmas; ours is two years old. We finally saw the movie all the way through on VHS with no problems. We've written Universal Studios about the problem but have not heard back. Be aware of this possible glitch between the disk and your player when you purchase!"
1,Boring,"Potential was there in this movie. Whether I was in a bad mood or not, I don't know, but this was sooo slow. I was not captivated by the plot and Brad Pitt was not believable in his role and I didn't feel connected with the story. If you liked movies like Apocalypse Now or even AI you may enjoy it. Patriot Games and The Hunt For Red October were better movies. Far better ""Spy"" movies are out there. This was well filmed and the production was good."
1,"Great Movie, Except for the Captioning!","This movie would be getting 5-stars from me if it wasn't for the damn closed captioning popping up. I've read other reviews, and it seems other people are having similar problems. I have a Toshiba SD-1600 so maybe it is a Toshiba-specific problem. I emailed Universal so I'll see what happens.....Maybe Hollywood executives should stop holding fundraisers and giving money to Bill Clinton and his pinko Democratic friends and instead, take some time and effort into actually checking to see if a DVD works before mass producing and selling it."
2,A John Le Carre imitation,"Too much fluff. Too much imagery without any character development. Brad Pitt's charcter or that of the English girl (for whom he supposedly goes rogue) is underdeveloped to the maximum. Also, ending was too predictable and hence preposterous.Not much to think there."
3,Not a Memorable Movie but Quiet Interesting,"I wasn't satisfied with Spy Game, but it is one of the realistic spy movies out there in years. It is an average movie that can be forgotten fastly and not one of the memorable movies out there. I say, give it a try and never judge a book by it's cover! It's a So So movie and needs thinking while the story goes on. I liked the movie but not much, and the movie is longer than what it should be, the plot is streched more than average. The Video is great, the sound is SPECTACULAR with the DTS sound, but there is a little problem with the subtitle switching it on, it won't switch on at all, I don't know why but other people I know or other reviews that I have read, it was the opposite where the subtitle won't switch off instead of my problem which is ON!!!UNIVERSAL >> Fix the Problem please...Thanks"
5,Great Movie,"This is a very suspenseful movie, despite the times where the viewer is quite capable of predicting what will happen in the following scene. The storyline is interesting, and the reconstruction of war torn lebanon, is a quite accurate depiction of what the atmosphere was like during that period of civil unrest. Nevertheless, there was one flaw in one of the scenes. The scene where Robert Redford, Brad Pitt, and his lady friend are in a bar. The music playing in the background, an arabic song, Nour El Shams, is a contemporary song, yet for some odd reason, it seems to have been played in a time, which was way back when. This song didn't even exist, neither did the singer sing, so why was it being played? Who knows?! Nonetheless, a great movie that is enjoyable to watch."
1,DON'T WAISTE YOUR MONEY!!!,"This movie was a waste of time. I love Brad Pitt movies(I haven't seen 'The Mexican' yet though) and so far this is his worst. The entire plot is rediculous. Robert Redford always staying one step ahead of the other agents. NONSENSE! He always having to tell the story of 'Brad Pit's' character. They'd flash back 25-30 years and Both of them had the same hair style, sideburns and wrinkles on the face(Robert Redford) Too much time in the sun Robert-ever heard of sunscreen? Overall, this movie is ... and should be reported as so. I bought it first and lost bigtime. I highly recommend renting first. That's if you don't care to lose a couple of hours of your life. PS. I never had the closed captioning problem. ... Just thought I'd throw that in. Thanks"
3,Eye Candy,"This is a fairly by the numbers spy thriller but with better acting than usual. Both Pitt and Redford give good performances but even so you don't feel to much for any of the characters and you can pretty much see all the plot twists and turns coming from a mile away. That said this is not a bad nbit of entertainment for your dollar. Much can be said for a decent director and some good acting. If your into the spy thriller genre, and by the looks of Tom Clancys paychecks many people are, then this will please even the most discerning fan."
2,Interesting but not very realistic,"The story is actually interesting, but unlike Tom Clancy, the writer(s) don't create a story around a true view of reality. Instead, they start with a warped Hollywood view of intelligence operations and CIA agents, and then develop a story that makes heroes out of their two primary stars. It's pure Hollywood, but it is entertaining. If you're a Brad Pitt or Robert Redford fan, you'll like it."
2,"Has its moments, but otherwise dull","This is an okay one time watch, but it is not worth the purchase. I am big fan of the spy genre, but this failed to live up to my expectations. There is a ton of unnecessary exposition, and no real tension. I didn't care much for the characters either."
4,24 precursor??,"If you enjoy the television series, 24, youwon't be able to help noticing the manysimilarities they share, mostly in termsof the 24 hour-type countdown. No, thepace and plot (both of which are great) arenot as white-knuckle as 24's is, but thatwon't stop fans of the series from hunkering downand really enjoying this flick. Not to be missed."
2,hey what the hell tony scott????,"I think Tony Scott is secretly a woman and you can tell whenever it's his time of the month because it's his time of the month when his movies suck. That's the only thing that would explain how he can make movies so amazingly good as The Last Boy Scout, Top Gun and especially Crimson Tide, and then turn around and make movies as horrifically bad as this and True Romance."
2,LET THE BUYER BEWARE!,"I couldn't wait to pick this one up, but my enthusiasm was quickly abated; expecting the full-throttle excitement of a colourful, booming, state-of-the-art espionage game for my computer, I discovered I'd purchased a wholly predictable and woefully pedestrian Hollywood ""thriller,"" instead. Here's hoping the schlub behind the misleading marketing is swiftly court-martialled."
3,"Not in a class with ""The French Connection""","Ok, I have a real dislike for Robert Redford but spy movies are my favorate, this one was even honest, no shoot up spies like in some movies. I've also been weerly of seeing anything with Brad Pitt since Legends of the Fall but he's building his stock back up with me. For the most part this movie is ok, I'd watch it again I just wish they wouldn't have put Robert Redford in it."
1,Spy Game,"This is a film I've been wanting for a long time but I really got stung with this purchase ! The Format is HD DVD which, I found out AFTER I opened the package and attempted to view it, not only does not work with MY DVD Player, is apparently in a Format that is destined for the cemetary. I'm Sure Amazon was aware of that fact when they listed it for sale and, in fact, it Was identified as being HD DVD. However, to a neophyte like me, it didn't ""Ring a Bell"" that I wouldn't be able to play it without a special HD DVD player. A Prominent Warning would have been a Nice thing to do. NOW, I'm stuck with it because ""opened"" merchandise cannot be returned for a Refund."
1,scouse,"This is a pretty good movie but I'm placing this review to warn buyers that many reports are now coming in with problems playing this disc. On many players, Toshiba particularly, the close captioning for hearing impeared appears after running a few minutes and can't be switched off. These are much worse than subtitles as they cover a large part of the screen at times and makes watching the movie very frustrating. Wait until the studio produces a repaired copy or you will risk having a title you can't watch and wait months to get a replacment."
2,good action and background - BAD LOGIC,"A story within a story, the background (flashbacks) on recruitment, training and action of Bishop (Brad Pitt) is nice to follow with some real ""how to make a spy"" sequences. However the present story has collosal logical blunders:1. you don't design a rescue operation in 24 hours. (actually there was no planning.)2. you don't attack a prison with 2 choppers and 10 men.3. you don't attack another country by falsifying a signatureif you want to see a good action spy movie - try ""the little drummer girl"" based on the book by John Le Carre."
3,STRANGE DVD,The edition I rented from my local video store is not widescreened; I don't know why a full screen edition was ever produced since usually wqhen you get widescreen it is choice you can make on the DVD. It did have DTS though even though that featre is advertised as being on the widescreen edition.
1,Can't turn off closed captioning,"I rented the widescreen version and after many frustrating attempts to turn off the closed captioning, I bought the full screen version. However, that didn't solve my problem. So I wrote to Universal and explained the problem, after a week they ask for my DVD player make and model, Toshiba SD-3109. That was two weeks ago!"
5,Most viewed Favorite Movie,"When I was in D.C. in 2001, I saw this movie at the Union Station AMC. Besides the best place to see this movie, I loved it. I've watched it maybe 40 times and have it on DVD, iPod, and will get it on Blu-Ray very shortly. It is one of the best movies I have ever watched--enough action for the guy and a 'love story' for all others. I have a short list of favorites: Deja Vu, Top Gun, Shooter, Enemy of the State, but Spy Game is the movie I never turn off..."
1,Can't turn off captions,"To turn off the captions in this movie, one has to go all the way back to the menu [the regular 'subtitle' hot key is locked off for the dvd], wait through 5-10 seconds of music clip, scroll through the menu, turn them off, and once that happens, they stay off for 1-3 minutes at a time.note, these are the captions [which are mostly on screen, not just near the bottom edge, either], not the discreet subtitles.I doubt it will affect every dvd player, but it was extremely distracting... it was an effort to get through the movie."
3,Top notch thriller which take you for a nice ride,"Excellent thriller with new millennium A-list star Brad Pitt teaming with 70's A-lister Robert Redford (smartly casted in a 'Buddy picture' after Pitt took direction from Redford in his memorable yet under-appreciated ""A River Runs Through it"" from 1994) in an entertaining spy film directed by action-obsessed Tony Scott which will have you at times on the edge of your seat. Scott rewards his action hungry audience in calculated doses as the picture is laced with lots of intrigue, and second guessing including a clever use of flashback sequences for additional suspense to this international thriller. Catherine McCormack is appealing as the love interest for Pitt's character which goes beyond obligatory since the joining of the two conflicts with his mentor's guidelines for espionage survival. The chemistry of all the players along with Scott's exciting action input make this an above average Pitt/Redford 'Buddy flick'."
4,great purchase,"what a surprise, possibly the best movie Pitt has done, not fond of his work , but he is good in this, Redford great but when isn't he..."
4,Great fast paced CIA focused story.,Complicated story focused on CIA beauracacy and field operations. Redford and Pitt have great report which makes the story work. The plot is constantly shifting as it progresses. Characters have depth.
5,Incredible Footage,"I am not sure how the filmmaker did it, but the steady and clear footage of these two baby hummingbirds as they mature is extraordinary! The babies are chronicled as they grow in their nest with momma bird steadfastly returning for their feedings. Ultimately they take their first flight flying away on the wings of maturity. Combine this with some wonderfully chosen music and you have the makings of a touching, educational AND relaxing video. I highly recommend this to nature lovers in general and hummingbird lovers in particular!!!"
3,Hummer Sonata,Video did not live up to my expectations. Photography good but it only showed similar views of the hummingbird nest with chicks. Progressed from small chicks until they fledged and left the nest. Content was repetitive. Music did not live up my expectations.
2,Sonata,"This is a short, 10-minute, view of only a few portions of the process of humming birds raising their young in a nest. Photography is good, but this is not worth the price."
4,Brooding Beauty,"Inspired by The Velvet Underground and perhaps also The Cure, The J&M Chain made feedback and distortion an integral part of their wall of sound, creating a unique and distinctive niche in rock music. It was in the way they did it - the distortion never sounds intrusive or discordant but complements the detached vocals for a cohesive music of eerie beauty. In this crucial way the music differs from most of the output of the industrial genre, in that it has a flowing, hypnotic quality. My favorite tracks on this seminal album include Just Like Honey, The Living End, The Hardest Walk, Sowing Seeds, My Little Underground and the sublime You Trip Me Up, a poignant blend of the tender and the ominous. Psychocandy is a successful experiment in blending feedback with melody, creating atmospheric but always tuneful soundscapes that linger in the mind."
3,Some cautions,"5 stars for the content but the reissue could have been better. First, don't assume that just because this is a dualdisc it has been remastered in 5.1 (like the Talking Heads dualdisks.). THE JMC RE-ISSUES HAVE NOT. The DVD side gives you ""enhanced stereo"" whatever that means?? The CD side is vastly improved sonically over the first gen CD though. Second, the song, Some Candy Talking, which was appended to later versions of Psychocandy CD pressings (credited on Canadian and British versions but an uncredited track on later US versions) has dissapeared again. This beautiful tune perfectly captures the transitional phase between the fuzz and distortion of Psychocandy and the gentler Darklands sound. Why take content off, I certainly think the disk had capacity left on it?"
4,Menacing beauty,"Inspired by The Velvet Underground and perhaps also The Cure, The J&M; Chain made feedback and distortion an integral part of their wall of sound, creating a unique and distinctive niche in rock music. It was in the way they did it - the distortion never sounds intrusive or discordant but complements the detached vocals for a cohesive music of eerie beauty.In this crucial way the music differs from most of the output of the industrial genre, in that it has a trance-like, hypnotic quality. My favorite tracks on this seminal album include Just Like Honey, The Living End, The Hardest Walk, Sowing Seeds, My Little Underground and the sublime You Trip Me Up, a poignant blend of the tender and the ominous.Psychocandy is a successful experiment in blending feedback with melody, creating atmospheric and always tuneful soundscapes that linger in the mind. Those who likeMercury RevorMy Bloody Valentinewill love this classic album which takes rock music to places it's never been before."
2,"Music = excellent, dual-disc = teh suck","I'd love to rate this on the music alone.Sadly, I haven't been able to LISTEN to it because I can't rip the CD on my PC to load into my iPod. I've tried a DVD-RW drive and CD-ROM drive on two different PCs that rip discs with no problems...except these. The dual-discs feel as if someone literally took a CD and a DVD and SuperGlued them together. Shoddy.I really regret not getting the standard CD version."
1,Worthless dualdisc cd! Does not work in my cd player!,This dualdisc cd does not work in normal cd players! Neither the cd or the dvd side work! It even says on the back of the case that it might not work in some cd players! Why release something that cannot be listened to! What a joke!
3,So so,"The very first year, the orange plactic bars that you see in the picture broke off. Had to use the remaining nub to open and close the table. Net plastic guides also broke the second year. The surface was faded and became totally splotchy by the third year. The surface it self remained flat and playable. The wheels don't move well and the table is clunky. The cover tore immediately. We had it 5-6 years and then another key part broke (all plastic) and had to put it out with the trash. I had hoped for better life from something that cost me 600.What you want to watch out is that all the moving parts should be metal not plastic as they in this table."
1,Keep it indoors,My first Kettler outdoor table was great and lasted for many years but not my last table. It started rusting out in less then two years. Not only that but Kettler did not honor their 3 year warranty. If you buy their outdoor table you will get many years of enjoyment as long as you keep it indoors!
5,"The arrangements are great, too","As most reviewers here note, the music and lyrics on this album are brilliant. In addition, however, the arrangements are genius. The horn things jive with the bass and swing like Gina Lollobrigida in a rumba contest, while Ricky Lee's voice soars and glides like Cirque du Soleil in the space station. There is complexity here that gives great pleasure in the hundredth listening, and the thousandth."
5,Fresh and Modern,"this album (from a time when they were still albums) is still fresh and modern and listening to it again makes you aware of how many artists have been influenced by this music, some of the musical chords amazingly poignant and others so exciting and energy-filled. If you haven't sat still and listened to this from one end to the other in years (while re-reading the lyrics), you owe yourself a treat to do so, you won't regret a moment of it."
5,Institutional Investors is a Must Have!,"Institutional Investors is a magnificently written text. The authors do a wonderful job describing issues facing institutional investors (US and globally) each day. They provide a thorough and detailed explanation and analysis of the institutional investment process, from asset management to trading, as well as provide commentary on the ever-changing structure of the financial industry. It is a must have for anyone wishing insight into the institutional investment process!"
5,"Super ""Club"" Indian music mix","This is a wonderfully creative mix of Indian and ""Club"" music. The ""Silent Ganges"" track is especially excellent."
3,"Good, but nothing compared to his new stuff","This is an excellent c.d. with a lot to offer any rap fan. However, everything that he's recently done with 4th Avenue Jones is superior work. He has one of the best live bands backing him up now. Check out his new stuff. It's unbelievable."
1,i am a music freak!!!,"Now I admitt it's sad but true this cd ia a one hit wonder. This Guy (Ahmad) never went anywhere. I herd this cd from a friend of mine the whole cd that is. I knew the song (Back In The Days) witch is a great hit song. I love it alot!!! But not that much to buy the cd. Sadley the other songs suck and thats not even the worst part are you ready for this??? One of the most favorite, most popular hit, best sounding song on the cd ever, is a different version of the song. Can this get any worse??? nope!!! guess not but heres 1 good thing now you know not to buy this cd thats all I have to say comprende!!!"
2,The energy is gone...,"This second offering from the Dudley Manlove Quartet is a downer. The energy that was evident in the first album (recorded at live performances) is totally gone. It's a shame, as there are quite a few songs on this CD that sound like they'd be great live. Instead, they sound, well, dead."
5,Excellent in every way,"Great job in editing and a good cross section of performances. Carlos Santana takes it, though, for the on fire finale. Well worth watching if you like all kinds of music from around the world and well worth watching, also, if you are looking for an education in musical styles but aren't well versed in them. Head bangers may want to look elsewhere."
4,Classic Alt/New Wave Rock,"Album came in good condition (as promised). Delivery took longer than most, but within time frame given. New Order defines 80's dance music."
2,well...,"I only recieved 1/2 of this order ( disk#2)- not sure what went wrong where, seems like miscommunication between Amazon and the seller? Still, the seller was kind enough to refund the full amount paid, and although I oferred to return the disk I DID recieve, the seller did not ask for it to be returned."
2,Rather Boring,"The rhythms in this music are so monotonous, songs go on and on and on, with no direction, as if the songwriter didn't know how to end the song. Very disappointed in this because an intelligent person recommended this album and I expected much much better.Just a bunch of over-drugged and over-sexed punks, no role models here!I don't recomend you buy this one."
1,this isn't that good...,"i went to my friends house and i wanted to play my backstreet boys record and he said no and he put on some unknown band i never heard of called new order.he made me listen to these songs called ""confusion"" and ""true faith"" and it made me sick. these guys are no talent bums, i suggest you buy something with talent like aaron carter."
5,More than worth the price of admission.,"For the budding New Order fan, Substance is the perfect place to start. It's got most of their well-known songs, and they're all wonderful. Some get pretty lengthy, but once you get into the groove, which doesn't take long, the length only adds to their charm. Even a punk rock fan like me can handle the eight and a half minute long ""Perfect Kiss"".This is techno pop at its best, but don't limit it with your preconceptions of everything that genre has to offer; these songs are wonderfully layered, and have much to offer fans of any musical category.In short, if you are afraid of New Order becoming your favorite band, don't buy this album. But if you want to listen to one of the more beautiful bits of music history, shell out the twenty-some-odd dollars and start listening. You'll be glad you did."
3,"SOME GOOD SONGS, SOME BAD SONGS.","New Order is one of my favorite groups, but the reason I am not raving about Substance is because their are just as many good songs as their are bad.Substance could as well have been 1 cd....I have had this record since it came out, and I still play it, but to skip to my favorite songs like ""1963"", ""Perfect Kiss"" (where the remix could of been cut - the instrumental goes on forever especially the intro), ""Blue Monday"" and my all time favorite ""Bizarre Love Triangle"".The first CD is good, the 2nd cd is bad with songs that just don't have the impact of their hits. They sound more like B sides.Overall: #1 CD (5 stars), #2 CD (2 stars) = average = (3 stars)."
2,"The Music gets ""5 Stars""","I love new order, and I love the music on this CD. Unfortunately, if a CD ever needed to be remastered, it is this one. The recording level is very low on this disc, and it's hard to really hear the songs. I think I'll try to get ""The Best of New Order"", and see if it's any better."
3,Download it,"Let's forget the music for a minute. This item retails for $25. For that kind of money, you could be getting reissued artwork, remastered sound, and an expanded booklet. Instead, you actually get the same release that people bought 19 years ago, in 1987: Two near-blank pieces of paper slipped inside a bulky jewel case and two pictureless discs with primitive sound quality. Being one of New Order's most acclaimed releases, you'd think they'd give Substance a modern treatment by now."
5,"Great CD,Fast Shipping","Although I had to return the item, it was well packed and delivered in a very quick manner. This was to be a gift for a friend who does not have this CD. There is no doubt that the delivery service smashed the package resulting in the jewel box arriving with a crack across the front. Not good for a gift.Would buy from this seller again as the return was painless and the customer service was top notch. A very honest seller.James"
2,LOTS OF ERRORS!,"I'm an EE undergrad, and had several courses on programming, microcontrollers, etc. I'm using this and other books to teach myself the PIC family. As I proceed through this book I'm finding lots of errors and omissions in code and diagrams - which has the (unintended) blessing of forcing me to really learn by fixing the author's mistakes. Mr. Iovine should have more carefully edited his work - it will likely make the beginner crazy."
3,Good Book - Just uses PIC BASIC,"The book is a very good teaching guide, but ONLY if you buy PICBASIC ( $100 ) and the EPIC Programmer ( $ 35 ). Its a nice way to get started without learning assembly, but ONLY if you buy the PICBASIC. Well written otherwise, just not the book I will use other than a reference when possible...."
3,Be careful- Read this before ordering,"I was surprised to discover that this book is not focused on the PIC's native programming language - It is focused on PIC Basic. You will not be able to use this book unless you purchase a PIC Basic compiler for around a hundred dollars. To make matters worse, you must purchase the specific (DOS-based) one recommended in the book if you expect the examples to work as written. Other compilers have significant variations in syntax and capabilities.Not a bad book - just be aware of what you are getting."
4,PIC Microcontroller Project Book,"The digital age moves at a great pace and any publication more than a few months old is out of date. The PIC Microcontroller Project Book is in fact such a book. However if you want to begin using PICs, then this is an excellent place to start. The book begins at the beginning and describes the use of the tools necessary to produce code to be programmed into the PIC.Further chapters give instruction on programming in PicBasic with simple examples of programs to get the PIC to do what you want. It is as it suggests a Project Book. I find that I learn faster with this structured stepwise instruction.I found the book useful and informative. The book is for the person who is starting off. To delve more deeply into programming PICs, you will need to do further reading, but, you will have a good basic understanding of the operation of PICs and their potential.I would recommend this publication highly and congratulate the author on a job well done."
1,An expensive catalog,"This book is little more than a catalog for ""Images Company"", just like all of the other John Iovine books that I've read. Of course what the author fails to mention in each book, and even on the company's web site, is that _he is the owner of said company_. And yes, you can order just about everything you need from him, but be prepared to pay as much as 600% over what you would pay anywhere else (digikey, mouser, radio shack, etc). Once again, I'm left feeling cheated.One more thing.....the book is only 195 pages long, not 272 pages."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!,"Do not buy this book! It is nothing more than a giant catalogue for Images Co. (which the author owns). It teaches you less then any other thing you could buy (including the PICBasic assembler instruction book). It is page after page of buy this, buy that, and it doesn't teach you anything. I also belive that no one would write a good review for this book.... ... again, if you buy this book you WILL be disapointed.... I can't belive anyone would even publish this book."
2,Too many errors,"This book is an okay book for the beginner, but if you don't already have some electronic and programming knowledge, you will probably be pulling your hair out as there are a lot of typos, especially in the code samples. Since this book is suppose to take the newbie (judging from the almost agonizing explanation of binary counting)from ground zero I would extend the opinion that the errors are critical failures and eliminate the usefulness of the book. If however you are already a somewhat able ""hacker"" (or a professional Software Engineer like myself), the book is a great way of learning the basics of firmware writing and does in fact transfer the knowledge it is supposed to."
2,Beginners could do better!,"I think this book was written just to generate revenue! While it might be OK for experienced electronic technicians, it's weak on advanced subjects. I also disagree with the author's suggestion of PicBasic over PicBasic Pro. In my opinion, 'Pro' is a better buy.Also, beginners should beware of some serious schematic errors. For example, in two circuits there's no filter capacitor between a bridge recifier and a voltage regulator. While errors like this are easy to overlook, for a newbie, it means the difference between a circuit that works and one that doesn't. I would have expected better editing on a book geared toward the beginner."
2,"Thanks for nothing. PIC Basic, not basics of PICs.","This book is maybe OK but the first half of the book covers a evaluation board and the operating program of one certain type of PIC. Even if I wanted wanted to buy the board and program, I couldn't afford it anyways. Waste of money if you want a more basic understanding of general PICS which that is what I thought the book PICS Basics was. I guess I misunderstood and thought it meant the basics of PICs."
3,"Another ""ok"" book","If you're looking for a place to begin as far as learning to write code & program things, look somewhere else. Even though this author gives you a bunch of code to type in, there's really nothing more explained to you in the process of it all other than what the code is supposed to do. I know to alot of people that may not make any sense but it's the best way I can think of to describe this book. You're actually better off going to school and learning to do this stuff."
3,Learn How To Interface Quickly and Easily With A Pic !!,"This book in my opinion, should open your world to programming microcontrollers, however since most of us take advantage of the windows environment so much these days, you may step back and reconsider.The author relays instructions on installing a EPIC DOS software program inside windows.He also illustrates some neat projects, however you must have the tools and hardware in order to get the results to learn Pbasic from this book. The code in the book may give unexpected results, especially if your are looking for something more visual from the output.The author doesn't relay this information, but the reader should still feel comfortable about learning PBasic.I've had a copy of this book since it first hit the bookstores a few years ago, and still recommand it to anyone who wants to learn PBasic."
4,Good starter book for those interested in PICs,"I bought the original edition of this book about 5 years ago, and it was instrumental in getting me started in PIC microcontroller programming and implementation. Although there are some errors throughout the book (someone commented that there are also errors in the new edition), and the hardware referenced is fairly dated (SPO256, for example, and some would argue the outdatedness of the PIC16F84), it's still a valuable source of information and reference. Browsing through the second edition, I see he's added PIC Basic ""Pro"" material, and filled out the chapters with more material specific to the chapter. The original edition was a good ""hand holding"" introductory tour through the use and function of a basic PIC microcontroller, and although I don't own the second edition yet, it looks to be more of the same, with a repeat of most of the original material."
1,"Huge, no dual voltage","For a compact product like the Forereuner, the AC/DC Charger is surprisingly large and does not offer the dual voltage feature for 110/220 V, which is a big limitation. (Every PC and appliance now offers that)."
2,120V 60Hz only,"Classic brick AC/DC transformer is for North America only. I hoped for a ""dual voltage"" AC/DC convertor which could be used overseas."
1,Advised but was not needed,"I was informed that this was needed with a product (the Garmin Forerunner). The Forerunner came with its own charger. Now I'm stuck weith this charger, which makes it redundant. I really wpuld like to return it, buit didnt receive an original receipt."
1,Does not fit Nuvi 350 or 360,"Although marketed by Amazon to fit the Garmin Nuvi 350, it does not! Wrong fitting. I've decided to just charge my Nuvi from the car with the DC cable that came with it, the same way I frequently charge my cell phone."
4,There's no pit with this pendulum.,"""The Pendulum's Path"" is a uniquely written, powerful tale of a family that was and shouldn't have been, and the family that wasn't, and should have been. The story, told by the lead character, in first person, takes getting used to, but moves quickly with many evocative passages. The characters are real, and their lives are possible.From Tom Lewis' cold meeting with his frosty ""Uncle"" Martin, to the exciting climax, the author, Dave Shields, takes you through a story of intrigues, lies, deceptions, trials, and reconciliations. The sins of the ""Father"" truly are visited upon the generations.If you've ever had a family, you will enjoy this book."
4,Take a walk down this path...,"I give author Dave Shields a thumbs up with his heart-wrenching story of families and secrets. It's ironic how those who love us most are often the ones who hurt us the deepest.Dave takes us on a tangled journey of a man and his family and the heartache and pain one domineering patriarch can cause to generations after him.Using mountaineering as a metaphor for life, Shields takes us on a journey inside one man's acceptance of a painful secret, and the peace and healing he brings to others.Often beautifully descriptive of the Salt Lake City area and the Wasatch mountains (where the Winter Olympics were recently held), I enjoyed ""Pendulum's Path"" and expect even greater things to come from Dave Shields. Well done."
1,"Poorly constructed, doesn't do job","I am using five of this product (385-49B). The pages slip through the rings. The two halves of each ring do not fit positively together and do not stay together well. I used them according to instructions -- open only by depressing the metal snap tab -- but they still don't work well. I can't understand how it could be hard to make a decent 3-ring binder -- and this is the ""Heavy Duty"" model. Highly disappointed after more than one year of light use."
4,inspiring,"A really inspiring look at the greatest adventurer of our time. I bought this just before he went missing....The writing is a little amatuerish, which means he probably wrote it all himself rather than some ghost writer."
5,A motivated person to achieve,An incredible person whose ambition is to do it better than anyone else and to break records. Almost anything in life that Fossett set out to do he has done. I wish there were more Fossetts around. Good read.David Bingham
4,More adventures in one lifetime than most of us could handle,"I now have a good idea of the personality that routine adventuring requires. Most of us would do well to be part of just one of these exploits. It certainly makes for a good argument on what place scouting might play in someone's life.I found Steve's approach to describing his adventures to be enlightening. He is vary frank about what did or did not work, as well as the element that chance can play. I somehow imagine that he was just as frank with his clients when explaining the pluses and minuses of a particular stock or commodity.My only disappointment was the topics that were not covered. He does not describe his single airship record listed in the back, nor his participation in several types of road racing, despite three photos included. Perhaps these did not live up to his goals, but I still would have liked to have heard his take on them."
4,Great Album,"One of the best in Alternative Music, Kula Shaker hits the mark with my favorite Tattva. But even though it hit commercially both through MTV and radio play, the rest of the album is worthy of a listen too. Sit back and enjoy a croos of Indian, Psychedellic and Hard Rock, blended together and served up in one convenient package!"
5,a great catchy pop album,"K is a wonderful album with some great eastern grooves blended with some fantastic classic rock remindful of Sanatana, Greatful Dead and Jefferson Airplane. They do get some flak from rock purists, deadheads and assorted eastern spiritualists and dalai lama devotees. Cheer up and welcome the 90's pop folks: It is rather obvious that KS is about style and not ideology. They have a sense of humor about it and do not take themselves all that seriously. You have to respect them for that."
3,Good idea but...,"Kula Shaker had a great idea. Why not use elements of sixties rock, particularly raga rock, in a nineties album? Give them points for this superb concept. Unfortunately, Kula Shaker has taken the worst elements of sixties rock for their experiment, rather then the best, and combined it with rather average nineties rock. Take for example the radio hit ""Tattva."" The song has a good verse tune, but the lyric drips with pretension and the fuzzed vocal of the chorus sounds much more menacing than it should, as if mysticism is necessarily evil or something. They surely didn't mean it that way, but that's the way it ends up sounding. It isn't very catchy either. This album makes a fun rainy day listen now and again, but it isn't a masterpiece and will probably be forgotten for a while."
5,kula kool kula kool kula kool,great album that's all there is to say. oh yeh i heard the lead singer Mills is the son of that one actress Haley Mills or whatever oh who cares this album rocks......
3,Good ideas,"Kula Shaker has good ideas about trying to bring back elements of sixties pop that are missed. However, with a song like ""Tattva"" they make it all sound unnecessarily sinister and obnoxious. (Listen to how that whiny vocal performance grates with those drone guitars.) Interesting theory if not always practice."
4,get it,"i've had this album for a few years now and i always return to it. it came out in a time when most bands sounded the same, and even 4 years later kula shaker still have an awesome and different sound going for them. anytime i pull this out for friends to listen to they buy it for themselves, and you should to."
5,Somewhat of a Swinging 60s sound!!!!,"Now, i'm an intense heavy metal fan, but all metalheads have to have their soft spots. As i was saying, these british lads sound like early Black Sabbath meets some Indian influences. Worth getting"
5,Nephew loved it,4 year old nephew who loves horses has really enjoyed when his mom and dad read him this story before bed.
4,"Gorgeous Pictures, Not-So-Great Writing Quality","Fun books for their illustrations and not their writing quality, the Billy and Blaze series were always at the top of my list growing up. This particular story isn't as exciting as some of the others (such as Blaze and the Mountain Lion, or Blaze and Thunderbolt). But it still smacks of great adventure, and I think little boys in particular will be drawn to it.Although poorly written, the Billy and Blaze series was fascinating to me as a girl and fed my imagination. Any young horse lovers will eat up the vivid black and white drawings that tell the quaint stories much more eloquently than the rather dry words.To read more of my children's book reviews, visit larsenreviews.org."
4,Watch,"I like this watch. It appears to be well built. I wear it in the water and it holds up well. It is a little bigger than I anticipated, but not to big."
3,okay watch,"This inexpensive diver watch is an okay watch for daily wear. It's pretty beefy, thick and heavy. So if your not into big watches, this watch is not for you. For a daily beater watch this watch is perfect. The rubber loop to hold the band together doesn't always stay in one place and you may need to reposition it several times. However, with any watch with a polyurethane watch band, the band will break some day. The band itself costs about t17 to 20 dollars. For an additional 30 dollars you can buy a brand new watch again. If you want something thats more durable, buy a diver watch with a metal/steel band instead of the polyurethane band."
5,Always & Forever by Randy Travis,"I am pretty new to country music and tend to like the older, softer balladeers. I wasn't crazy about Randy's voice at first but soon it really grew on me. Great lyrics that stay with you..."
5,Love every song on this CD,Only Randy Travis cd I wasn't thrilled with was Wind in the Wire. I love the rest of them.
5,He has a great voice,"I ordered this for my son, and ended up loving this CD, Randy Travis has a beautiful deep voice, and his music is very nice."
2,Cloying Raspberry Flavor,"I wanted to love this coffee. I wanted to want to drink it all day long. But, it's not meant to be.The raspberry flavor is incredibly cloying--so strong that the actual taste of coffee is lost. I almost always have to cut this coffee with a plain coffee (I use about an 8th of this coffee to non-flavored coffee to just get a hint of raspberry and chocolate).If you love raspberry flavor (which I do), just be warned that this may be too powerful even for the staunchest raspberry connoisseur. Exercise caution--or at least just buy 1 bag at first, instead of 4 (like me)."
2,"Coffee Masters Flavored Coffee, Chocolate...",Poor flavor and has a strange almost chemical taste from something. Forced myself through one bag because of the cost but threw the other two bags away. Will never buy again.
3,Pretty good clock,"A really nice feature is that the brightness of the display can be adjusted to multiple settings, unlike the one or two on most clock radios. Sound is good, and we like the two types of display. One problem - the digital display is quite hard to read at a distance. Also, the time synchronization attachment works great but is kind of clunky."
2,Doesn't live up to the Description,"The atomic clock signal is weak and not near as stong as two other recent purchases from Seiko. The instructions are terrible and not very helpful. Making any kind of adjustments requires the reader to carefully follow all the steps as outlined which seems fine except just turning off the alarm in case you get up early or just want to cancel it is a major pain. The humane waking is system is overrated. Yes, it gets louder in increments but very quickly and not as slow as described. I would consider another alternative."
2,The atomic clock is a phoney!,"I called Sangean to find out why the time was not synchronizing, to which the technician replied, ""Well it's not the strongest atomic clock there is..."" Then when I explained what I had done to test it, he was arrogant, unhelpful, and not in too many words told me tough luck!Just for the record, I purchased another clock from Radio Shack (which they don't sell anymore, or I would have bought another one of those!), which works perfectly fine.What a ruse!"
2,Great idea; badly executed,"I love the features of this unit, what with the auto-setting feature and the analog clock face and all the different alarm settings and so on. I even like the ""Humane Waking System.""But after only a few days, the pretty blue light you see in the pictures went out and wouldn't come back on, so that in the dark we had to shine a light at the clock to see what time it was. That was aggravating but not fatal.However, recently the self-setting feature has gone haywire as well. The clock still sets itself, but it always sets itself between 78 and 79 minutes fast. There's no way you can set the time manually and turn off the auto-set, so we completely ignore the time on the clock face now and set our alarms for an hour and 18 minutes before when they're supposed to go off...and we have another old clock radio right next to this one that actually keeps time (although we have to set it manually) and whose digits we can see.We've had ours for a little over a year."
3,Backlit display is too bright.,"I agree with the prior reviewer that the backlighting on the display is just too bright. I did turn down the backlight as much as possible, but it's still too bright. It illuminates the whole bedroom in a blue glow. Other than that, it's fine."
2,serious lack,"I got this clock a week ago and I am observing it's performance closely. It is indeed an atomic clock; however, it's digital numbers don't light up. This for me is a very sad oversight of the engineers. I place the clock 7 feet away from the head of the bed on top of a 4-foot drawer stand and I cannot see the digital time of the clock. Even the analog clock is not clear; because of everyone's familiarity with the analog clock's hour numbers in circular design, one can see the position of the hour and minute hands and can ""surmise"" the current hour and minutes. It just blows my mind that the electronic designers of this clock have seemed to think of and worked on its many good features and weren't convinced that making illuminated digital numbers and figures is quite important."
2,Not so great,"I bought this item a couple of years ago, and it seemed great according to the description. But it is almost maddeningly complicated to set up for the alarm functions. In fact, after I finally got it to wake me up I quit trying to change radio stations or volume levels. Also, it has a real hard time synchronizing with the time signal from Colorado. I have a small wristwatch very near this clock and the wristwatch nas no problem getting the correct time, but this thing, with its big antenna seems to have a terrible problem recieving the time signal."
2,not completely reliable,"My husband bought me this clock radio as a gift. Not long after using it, the blue backlight stopped working. We fiddled with the brightness controls, but nothing helped. It just stopped. I resigned myself to not being able to see the time in the middle of the night. Then recently, the time itself stopped working correctly. The analog time and the digital time showed two different times, neither correct! The digital clock began running way behind time (not good if you want an alarm to go off on time). I was just about to junk it and order a new clock radio when I went in to take a look at it one more time, and both clocks are now reset to the correct time and seem to be functioning... after more than a week of not working right! Go figure. If you buy this, check it frequently to make sure it is still functioning correctly. Maybe I just got a lemon."
1,Horrible User Interface,"This is the most horrid clock radio ever. The user interface is terrible, and the physical unit is huge. The time receiver antenna is a monster and highly ugly. I couldn't figure out how to set the alarm or change the radio station. This truly has the most horrid manual and the buttons were clearly not designed with the user in mind.This item got sent back and a $15 Emerson clock radio is vastly superior. The company clearly does not elicit feedback from real humans during the design process. I can't imagine anyone actually using this device outside of their engineering labs."
5,Just what I needed,This Bill Nye video was just what I needed to compliment my simple machines unit. The students loved it! (I teach 2nd grade.)
4,yup,"Seemed like a decent grab bag gift to get, so I got it, and it's a DVD, but Bill Nye is pretty awesome."
3,Extra tracks aren't worth it,"I LOVE Icehouse! I already have 2 recordings of Berlin Tapes; The 13 track straight disc and the double disc Tapes & Boxes. When I saw there was an import with extra tracks on it I had to get it. Unfortunately, I blindly bought the disc, it's the Berlin Tapes, it has to be awesome. Not so much. The four extra tracks sound like Boxes rejects. They don't have the same melodic vibe that the rest of the Berlin Tapes has. Instead of ending with the melancholy of ""heroes"" you are thrust into a jarring synthy soundscape. Uck! This disc sat on my wishlist for months waiting for the price to drop. Were the four songs worth the money spent. No. If you collect all things Icehouse I'd download them instead."
5,great subject on decision making,I enjoyed this book. Understanding how people make buying decisions individually and as a group was of great value to me. Hopefully the author will write book 2 shortly as it really leaves the reader wanting more!!!
4,A Great Horror Thriller but Could be better,"Ok,This Isnt bad movie at all.If you enjoy horror Thrillers like Blade then you will enjoy this one.Full of good special effects and music and actually a well balanced storyline.Full of nightmaric creatures such as Zombies and Hellish Dogs and even a top-secret creature known as a Licker in the video game.If your not into Horror Thrillers this may not be a movie for you...but if you are this is a great movie that I myself think could be better but good enough to earn my support! Please check this movie out! and if you have played the game seriers definantly check it out If you have'nt already! I Give this one 4 and 1/4 stars."
3,Hmmmmmm,"I liked this movie it had very little gore tho but for a new horror movie it had lots. I know this was based on a video game but this could have worked has a prequel to night of the living dead if you think about it, cause the story in night for the living dead is radation has caused people to mutate in this one a virus has caused people to mutate this would work too as a prequel. Anyways about the movie i gave it three stars because there inst much gore involved but it is really fast paced and it never stops and you also have some neat monsters but again you see almost no one get ripped apart by these monsters. Give this a rent if you want to."
2,Worst Blu Ray Transfer,"This review has nothing to do with the movie, i love Resident Evil. But the Blu Ray transfer is bad,bad,bad......!!!!!!!After watching Dark Knight, i watched Resident Evil... Lo and behold the vast difference of the two. Dark Knight has superb picture quality but Resident Evil is Grainy.. Stick to the DVD is my recomendation..."
3,Great Video and Audio Quality,"Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review. Thanks to those who do this.The video quality was excellent, although it was 1.85:1, instead of the 2.40:1 I prefer. The Dolby TrueHD 5.1 was also excellent.The movie was okay; not great."
2,Standard zombie flick,"Based on a computer game, Resident Evil actually looks like a computer game: the characters run around in a maze-like environment, shooting zombies and mutants while a standard video game soundtrack hums in the background. There isn't much of a plot, just enough to establish why the zombies are there. Admittedly, with two characters with amnesia and a possible traitor in the group, there is room for a plot twist, but any revelations are mere diversions from the killings.With more than a few references to other zombie flicks, particularly Night of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead, Resident Evil doesn't offer anything very new. The action is passable but nothing special; essentially, anything this movie does, some other movie has already done better. On the other hand, there is nothing truly bad in this movie: it merely lacks anything good."
2,Special Effects are not all a movie needs.,It bothers me to see that almost all adaptions of Video Games to the screen focus entirely on special effects and not on plot. Unfortunately Resident Evil is not the exception. The zombie gore and grosseness is all there is to focus on in the film so the viewer is left waiting for the credits to roll. There is no balance between the plot and the action. Leaving this film lacking and boring.
2,Rediculous,"This movie was totally dumb. The only thing I give it credit for is the fact that it made me jump. Wow....big deal. The zombies were so phony and the ending.....well, I wont give it away but it definently dissapointed me more than the movie itself and that was pretty hard to beat."
2,"if u had a zombie living in your closet, it'd probably make more sense then this movie","I did watch Resident Evil: Apocalypse back when it was in theaters & I rather enjoyed it! this movie, I just got to today & found myself wondering what the hell happened. the movie is just so much stupider then the second one. I found myself laughing at parts where we're ""supposed to be scared"". the acting is just not that good, it's corny as hell. hasn't anyone in this film ever heard of a zombie before? if a zombie was coming at you, would you lower your weapon or blast it apart? like, what are they doing? I got so mad at this film cause it's so stupid. why do the characters have to be so dumb? I'll blame the writers, the director's for this. Resident Evil is not worth your time or money. I found the second one more enjoyable for some reason. so please, look elsewhere. I'd be more entertained by a fish swimming in circles."
2,it [was not good],"I dont understand where all the gore went. Thirteen ghosts was filled with gore that was not needed,this film is based on a video game that was bloody from start to finish,its rated R so why? No zombies show up for 40 min and you only see one mutant creature.The dogs are killed off too fast and with no originality,and yet another slow motion matrix ripoff jump kick. What a waste,they had 40 million dollars and millia jovovich and this is there best.dawn of the dead had almost no money,but they have a 2hr nonstop zombie masterpiece.watch it instead."
3,"Terrible movie, but extremely funny!","My friends and I got passes to ""Resident Evil"" on opening night. None of us were expecting very much, and we got even less. We only went for Milla Jovovich, and in that respect we got an eyeful (literally...keep your eyes peeled in the end for a brief but well-worth-the-wait shot of nudity). The movie's got bad editing, terrible dialogue, an awful soundtrack and a storyline that makes even less sense than that of ""The City Of Lost Children"". It was a good film to hoot at the screen for (and hoot we did), so I would imagine that it would make a perfect midnight selection for a party. However, if you're even tempted to rent it to watch with your buds, I would recommend something truly campy like ""Death Race: 2000"" instead. Hopefully I haven't upset anyone who seriously enjoyed this flick, but rather than lay the DVD in a place of honor, you'd be better off putting your twenty bucks toward the next ""Resident Evil"" game."
4,Above Average Horror film!,"This is a very entertaining and action-packed movie, and I see no reason why some people [knock] it! I mean honestly people, you will [knock] this movie, but look at all the horror ... that's coming out these days- Valentine, Jason X, the new Halloween movie, at least this movie is not another ... sequel to a ... franchise of movies. I'm glad this movie came out 'cause I love zombie flicks and this is an excellent one(but the best is still the black and white masterpiece Night of the Living Dead) but I feel that somehow they could have did something more(hence the 4 stars) I can't help but think what if Romero directed(but then it would probably not have come out in theaters because Romero loves gore and the MPAA would have probably tagged it with the dreaded NC-17 rating,...Anyway on to the movie this is a decent movie its no academy award winner, but it's definitly a good movie and you should rent it or in my case buy it if you enjoy action, and horror movies!"
5,First of a great series.,"I haven't played the game version, but I'm certainly hooked on this action/horror/sci-fiction story that moves along at a great pace. When experiments by the Umbrella Corporation result in an out of control, mutating T-virus, Raccoon City suffers the consequences. Alice is a highly trained super-chick who fights Zombies as she tries to get the secret to the surface of 'The Hive' to warn the innocent people. A mad scientist has more sinister plans for Alice and her fighting skills, not to mention the computer run 'Red Queen' who doesn't want to risk letting anyone out and taking a chance on spreading the virus. Of course, it's already too late for many of the living. Can't wait to view the next in this series!Chrissy K. McVay - Author"
4,You will need to divest yourself first of Resident Evil cannon in order truly enjoy its cinematic interpretation...,"After Sony and Capcom rejected zombie genre director George A. Romero's script in 1999, Director Paul W.S. Anderson was selected to take over the reigns of the Resident Evil production which was somewhat inspired by its video game counterpart as well as the Disney fairytale, Alice in Wonderland.Overall, Resident Evil was an entertaining movie from start to finish as it had a little bit of everything, including a foundation for a sequel (which turned out to be 2004's Resident Evil Apocalypse). I especially liked the scene transition using a digital schematic of the Umbrella Corporation's research facility known as the ""The Hive.""Check it out! But if you are a diehard Resident Evil videogame player, you will need to divest yourself first of Resident Evil cannon in order truly enjoy its cinematic interpretation which clearly stands on its own."
4,Non-existent plot but it's working!,"The plot (if at all) of the movie has been reused many many times before: evil corporation, things gone wrong. But all this is not the most important for horror thriller (although it never hurts) as this movie proves. This movie has suspense (at least it kicked my adrenaline), the special effects are quite good (I would do without the monster in the end though, which I thought was silly) and the acting is more then adequate."
3,"Milla Jovoich was great, everyone else was OK.",Starts off pretty good but then gets a bit strange when the walking dead arrive and other mutants arrive.
3,Well thought out transition,"'Resident Evil' has me wondering if I should lean towards personally classifying it a Sci-fi rather than Horror. The movie was teeth-gratingly full of tension, however, I did not even think to jump with suprise once. I was impressed with the fluidity of the CGI animation, this coming from guy who scoffed at the inconsistent skin movement of the Jurassic Park dinos (I was a School of Visual Arts NYC computer animation major.) The story line had very few flaws and did a great job of setting the premise for those who had no idea about the game. Movie viewers who are jazzed by the idea of flesh eating undead must seek out and watch 'Return of the Living Dead,' which should satisfy the urge for horror with a splash of comedy. Great sound, dazzling visuals and a good score make this movie an attractive addition to your DVD collection."
3,A good film,"Hi Fans.I'm Alex from Germany. I saw this movie in a preview last week an I'm surprised, that I haven't been disappointed.This film is far away of being nearly as good as the game, but it's worth being seen. Good camera. Good action. Good Fx. Good entertainment.As a really big Resident Evil-Fan I'm looking forward the Sequel.I think we should mention Bernd Eichinger (producer), who made Resident Evil possible to become a cool movie-flick.Sorry for my english, i hope everybody understood me :)Ciao,Alex"
4,finally a decent video game to movie adaption,"While the movie is loosley based on the resident evil games it still manages to stay true to its the games roots. just the simple things like the underground research facility, raccoon city, the arklay mountains and even the licker from the games will have the fans saying oh yeah i remember those. Im keepin this review short so for those of you who have no idea about the games, heres the pros and cons. pros: plenty of people getting killed here so this film will satisfy your barbaric needs, offers other neat sequences of action other than killing zombies, and the main monster is very well planned out. cons: the loud headbanging music really doesnt go with the resident evil genra, milla jovovichs red dress really is out of place here, the characters all have paper thin individuality. Its a good movie, just a few misteaks made but definatley worth watching."
1,All I Can Say...,"Is that you should avoid this film as if it was crawling with Ebola. It's utter nonsense, with hardly a cranial cavity on its' shoulders, much less a brain. The acting is so wooden I have half a mind to use it to make furniture. The plot doesn't make a lick of sense (something about a wicked corporation that runs the world and makes a new, deadly man-made virus, for no apparent reason), and the action sequences are utter trash, with no sense of urgency for the characters, because we don't care about them anyway. ""Resident Evil"" is crap on celluloid. Avoid as such."
3,short and sweet,"very good sci-i.little bit o horror. cute girls lots o shooting. special affects , thumbs up dude?/ uu decide."
2,A disapointment,"The score to this film was flawless but, the movie itself is just another average in my book. Marilyn Manson did the score for this movie and he did a job! If you watch the commentary to this movie they said that they didn't want to show zombies in the beginning because, you knew that you were gonna see some any way. The film didn't even have enough gore to be a serious zombie movie. I give this 2.5 stars."
4,So good its evil...,"Lets start out by saying that I have played most of the Resident evil game series by capcom...and I ensure you this movie gave the the same..If not worst of a scare than staying up to midnight with the lights off playing.. This movie was well planned out and was worth the long unexpected wait.. The acting was very great, the only reason I give it a four because the ending was a little week.. I liked how the upcoming sequal was hinted at.. I will definatly be looking forward to the next episode of many in the Resident Evil series.."
5,Duh...It's a new Resident Evil chapter.,"This movie was awesome. It ADDS to the overall storyline of Resident Evil. It is NOT a movie based on the original Resident Evil video game. It DOES have an original character in it (Nemesis, who gets an appearance at the end if anybody pays attention). Even if nobody knows anything about Resident Evil, the movie is well worth watching."
4,GOOD STUFF,"I really liked this movie. The sets were excellent, the acting decent, the action very good. I never played the game so I came into it totally unbiased. This is definately on my top ten list of movies to watch on cold winter days when I'm able to curl up in front of the tv and enjoy myself.You've already got the basic story line from other folks and apparently this is a 'love it' or 'hate it' type. Maybe if you can see the movie while putting aside the game you'll have a better time. Just sit back and enjoy the story and the action. You'll do just fine."
4,Surprisingly Good,"I'm not really a fan of the comic book or video game based movies, however, ""Resident Evil"" is one thrilling movie. The story line is well put together and original for the most part (ok, so there are zombies, past that though...)The sequel to ""Resident Evil"" I think makes this movie even better and you should definately watch both, in order. While Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodrigues might be type-cast, they certainly deliever when it counts.Those who play and know the video game I'm sure will like the movie even more then the uniniated such as myself, but do not let that stop you from see this surprisingly good movie."
4,we definitly need the sequel,"I thought Paul Anderson has done a really good job at directing this movie, and 2 of the cast members doing a funny audio commentary with one of the director's producing buddies. I'd give this movie 4 stars, because I've been a fan of video game based movies, after seeing Super Mario Brothers in 93' and Paul Anderson's ""Mortal Kombat"" in 95'. I would have given this 5 stars, if the movie wasn't too short and extended by 10-20 minutes. But I definitly gotta catch the sequel whenever it comes out."
3,Good but not like the game.,"The game is way better and there are too many spoofs like the writing in the the beginning ""TODAY ALL YOU'RE DREAMS COME TRUE"" they were both different and that was noticeable to me. The speacial effects were great and so was the action and acting. The way they made the ending it means that there has to be a sequel and I hope that they make it a little better than the first. That is all...Good bye."
2,very average,I went into this movie expecting to see something good because i have played all the resident evil games but instead was very disapointed for starters its an R rated film but i have seen more gore and horror in most M15+ movies secondly you only get to see the lickers the zombies and the rotting dogs which were killed off a bit to quickly and with all the experimenting going on there was not one tyrant in the film it is only mentioned at the end as mentioned in other reviews they had 40 million and milla jovovich to work with and it only came out as a very average film
3,Eh.,"RESIDENT EVIL is okay, if all you're expecting is a largely brainless action-fest. Romero zombie fans will be disappointed, as the undead make only brief appearances in the film and don't figure that much in the action. The frantic, music-video style of the film was also a bother to me, and I kept feeling that this would have been a far better movie if the producers had allowed Romero to script and direct it. Alas.The only redeeming feature of RESIDENT EVIL is Milla Jovovich, one of the world's most beautiful women. I could watch her in just about anything."
5,"""Scary As Hell!""",I do not scare easily at all. I saw all the NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET movies when I was 5 and I first saw Night Of The Living Dead when I was 4. Night of the living dead scared the daylights out of me and I think it's true that when you see sonething REALLY scary then things don't seem as scary anymore. I have never played any of the resident evil games so I just went to see the movie. I was terrified. The beginning was great and shocking! (Elevator scene) and the actors were great! This movie is terryfying and if they make a sequel and they probably will! I will go see it definately.
4,Not a bad movie but it needed more,"Regardless of what others have said (armchair critics) this movie was pretty good. What I think it needed was not to be cut so much. It seemed to go from one scene to the next with jump cuts that practically gave you whiplash (like going from the scene where there in the office And Milla kills the guys sister, right to them getting a back to the rest of the team running from the Zombies without anything in between). There was more of this movie people! I think the things that kept it from being great were left on the cutting room floor. Hopefully the'll come out with a directors cut. Still I think it deserves a sequel an a shot at being a better movie..."
2,An OK Dissapointment,"I have to say that Resident Evil was a worth-while movie. However, considering it was supposed to based on the first installment of the seris confused me. The movie and the game had some small similarities in their story lines, but all-and-all they were practicly different adventures altogether. I was dissapointed in the fact that not all the chacaters and monsters of the video game were present in the movie. And, most of all, that many, many key elements were cut or changed. But in spite of all that, the movie was really good. Nasty but good."
2,"Good from a game, bad for a movie.","For those of you who have not played the Resident Evil game, I suggest that you not purchase the DVD. The story line is unique but badly portrayed with corny scenes that makes you think ""oh no, they're doing that matrix bit again"". The zombies can be related to an 80's style dracula-like movie; the only real feeling you get is from the fast pumped and creepy music from Marilyn Manson, Slipknot, Static X, etc.All summed up, Aliens would of been a better purchase if you wanted to see a chick kick some [bottom]."
2,Probably The Worst Movie I Have Seen,"You know I have heard a lot of people love this movie, but when I watched it I was utterly dissapointed. I have played every Resident Evil game that has came out and I loved every single one of them. One of the things I liked about the game was the well developed plot. This movie does a horrible thing to that plot. First the movie is about a a virus that allows the dead to come to life as zombies that wander lifelessly feeding off human flesh. First the mansion would have been better left off the movie entirly it served no purpose other than to give us a few glimpses. Whatever they did to the police teams was atrocious and it still leaves me confused. The movie throws you into a situation where the police are holding people hostage during a raid on the house. I must say the only thing this movie has going for it is the excellent special effects, but they do not make up for the mutilated and awkward plot that was created."
5,bow to the evil baby!,"I am a fan of the R.E. I have the games,books and am looking forward to the movie. However I got to read the story for the motion picture. The movie is of course based on jill and her teams little romp through a nightmare...however it is not in the mansion even ...it is in a maze hive in which the licker is the ultimate bad guy...with a homocidle lunitic computer...the lick gets it power my moling the undead..... Hey what am i complaning about its resident evil so what if their is a little moyificatons...it may be for the best!March 15 here I come!O ya i get to see this on my birthday!"
2,Dead Movie,"I have never played the game, so I don't know who the characters were. And the movie didn't help either. After watching the movie, I still don't know any history of Milla's character. I don't even remember the name of her character. The movie's ending felt to me that there was no ending, even though I heard there will be a sequel.The movie had a few jump-out-of-your-seat moments. The laser hall was awesome. The makeup and effects were okay. Other than that, the movie really [stunk]."
1,I hated this movie,"I absolutely hated this movie. Resident Evil was the first Playstation game I ever played and I loved it. The game had enough of a plot and storyline that they could have made a MUCH better movie out of it.. if they had even bothered to set the movie in an abandoned Umbrella mansion in the woods, it would have been better. This movie is NOTHING like the game OR the books. I especially hated the cheesy outfit the lead character was wearing.. she was supposed to be a STARS team member, and they don't wear miniskirts for mission gear! HELLO!The whole thing was just stupid. I hope that the director of this one doesn't try to tackle any of my other favorite Playstation games for movies.. if he tries to come out with Parasite Eve I'll be violently ill."
1,Gawd awful!,"This movie SOOOOOOO sucks! I won't even waste my oxygen going into all the reasons why it does!Just know this... I have a personal collection of currently 538 horror films.... And I've prolly seen close to a thousand! I own most the Resident Evil games, and love those, although the series is getting moldy. Obviously I pick up just about anything within the horror genre... I will never claim ownership to this dreadfull title! Also know that considering that it boasts itself as being the movie based a videogame series that features flesh eating zombies... There is not one on screen munching of any kind! Anyone who says otherwise is full of it!If your that confused with all the horror afficandos and Resident Evil fanboy adolescents having such differing reviews. Spend the few paltry dollars and rent it first! Buying this one without seeing it, is definitely risking ownership of a very expensive coaster!"
3,One H*** of a Ride,"I'm a big RE fan (since that first zombie seen in RE 1 that made everyone jump). Now, I'm wary of video game-based movies, but I also remember a movie the director did called ""Event Horizon."" I must say, I'm impressed, not only with the plot, which fits nicely into the whole RE storyline, but also the choice in actors, the visual effects, and of course, the ""jump"" factor. It does help if you are familiar with the games (there are references to lickers, hunters, and the Nemesis), but if you like being scared, you'll like the movie. This was an awesome movie, and I look foward to owning it on DVD."
4,video games fans,if you are a video games fan you will love this movie end as a mexican fan that i am i say ESTA BIEN CHINGONA
2,Entertaining but brainless horror,"Sexy security operative (Jovovich) wakes up one night with amnesia, then gets ambushed by a commando squad and led into an underground research facility over-run by flesh-eating zombies. More entertaining than one would expect from another video-game adaption, but the visual effects are so laughably poor and the concept so ridiculous that most die-hard horror fans will see this to be a direct rip-off of George A. Romero&#65533;s zombie films. Ten points to anyone who can figure out Jovovich&#65533;s character&#65533;s name before the credits."
5,Resident Evil It's own movie.....,"First of all people say this is a rip off of other movies ie: Night of the Living Dead. Well in a way yes but this movie is also it's own movie.Resident Evil is based on the fact that a Virius infects the hive which is an underground research facility. This causes them to turn into Zombies which is the basic plot of the Movie and the games so it cannot really rip off night of the living dead when it is based on the game which has zombies in it.To really understand this movie you have to understand the game so unless you are a zombie fan, video game fan or someone who enjoys watching movies like this then you may not like this. This movie isn't for everyone, But from my point of view this movie was a really really good movie, great plot and sepcial effects as well as sound and cast."
1,Awful,"I guess you might have to be a fan of the game in order to enjoy the movie. But I doubt that even if that were true that one could derive any enjoyment out of this piece of trash. There is one moment of pleasure, for all you gore fans, but that is the extent. I hated almost every moment of it. It is not that the story so much is awful, it is the execution. And, the acting is not all that good either. Don't waste your time on this one."
2,People actually like this movie...?,"Let me start off by saying if you like true horror/zombie movies, then don't even bother watching this movie, it's a horror movie made for the mainstream, meaning it sucks.Sure the lead character is hot, sure there are some nice looking zombies in the movie...but thats where all the good stuff ends.The video game for the PS1 (and it's gamecube remake) are amazing, both in atmosphere and story telling, why the movie didn't follow them more closely is beyond me. Instead you get some horrible story about a computer and the t-virus (which is the only thing in the entire movie from the games, that and the spider-man creature).Paul W.S. Anderson should not be allowed to make movies ever again, he is a stain on hollywood that needs to be cleaned away."
2,does not deserve the name resident evil.,"When it came out in theaters i was a bit apprehensive but i got the courage to see it, well i was sad it SUCKED to the core. resident evil games rule cause of the darkness, storyline, creatures like my fav tyrants, spiders, alexia, steve and birkin.where was leon, claire, jill and chris.Instead they got a stick to play some drugged Alice. A licker as the main boss lol, yeah right lickers arent hard to kill in the games!!. People dont waste your time on this this is not resident evil material play the games or if you cant play videogames read the books by S.D Perry they are better!. P.S IM REALLY SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD."
1,Waste of time,"I was waiting anxiously for this movie to be released and I am now wondering why. This was absolutely the worst movie I've seen in years. It is a mish-mosh of totally irrelevant scenarios and I, being a fan of horror for years, lost interest in the first fifteen minutes. If you enjoy the game, do not purchase this film. I have a feeling that we should expect to see Resident Evil 2 on the horizon, due to the ending. Please don't bother."
1,RESIDENT MATRIX ANGEL...,"THE worst i mean worst movie ever,it lacks story plot devolopement and coherence.its pointless,you could care less if any of these characters live or die.plus it went to such lofty video game idea for a movie (they should have stuck with horror master GEORGE""DAWN OF THE DEAD ""REMERO)AND THE SUPPOSED PAY OFF ENDING IS THE MOST AWFUL CGI I'VE EVER SEEN IN MOVIE HISTORY.whats supposed to be a completely menacing ""licker"" ends up being a joke,i've seen scarier stuff on a tele-tubbies episode.this dvd would make a better drink coaster,its too bad you cant go lower than one star on your reviews cause i feel cheated in even giving it one star,dont rent or buy,cause this is 100 minutes of your life you can never get back"
2,DONT GO AND SEE IT.,THIS MOVIE WASNT WAHT I HAD THOUGHT. ITS ALL THE WRONG THING. U THINK THAT THIS IS GONNA HAPPEN AND SOMETHING ELSE HAPPEN. IF I WAS U THEN I WOULDNT GO AND SEE IT.
4,Resident Evil...,"This film was a first of it's kind in my opinion.It gets a lot of very bad reviews,and I just don't see why.The plot was very good,and thickened as the movie went on.Besides the few gory scenes,it was a fairly well directed movie that made you jump every few minutes.I wouldn't suggest lettingyoung children watch it...two words ""BAD DREAMS!!!"".So,I give it a 4 out of 5."
3,"Great game, turned good movie. Nothing Special though.","I have played all the games in the RE series (even the crappy Game Boy one) So I kinda knew the basics of the Resident Evil world. This movie is a prequel to the first RE game, showing how the virus infected Racoon City. Pretty good story, and special effects, but the acting and camera work could be better.For the life of me can't see how they got the microphone in so many scenes in this film, every other shot you see the damn thing hanging over the actor's heads.If you liked the RE video games, you'll like this movie more then most. And you'll get the little ""hints"" that people who haven't played the game won't, like ""I want him in the Nemisis Project"". Someone who plays the RE games knows the ""Nemisis"" is the main bad guy from RE3 on the Playstation. But as a zombie movie, it is ok, nothing special."
4,"Awesome, dissapointing ending though","Well, Milla Jovovich is one of my favorite actresses, no she IS my favorite. She's talented, not to mention beautiful, and reminds me of someone I know so that kind of helps. Anyway, as far as the movie goes, I gave it four stars, 3 for Milla and 1 for the rest. Not many names were mentioned in the movie except for Rain, but this was definetely one of those edge of your seat type movies. I stayed tense through the whole movie and I normally don't get scared or jumpy through any movie. Definetly good if you want to be scared. The plot was real good in the beggining, but it went downhill from there, mostly because it was confusing and didn't make much sense and the end left you hanging in a most unpleasent way, which is why I didn't give it five stars. But I loved it anyway, much gore, very bloody, very cool. Hopefully there will be a sequel because the ending is just begging for one."
2,they splooged this one down the hole,it doesnt do good with its wooden dialogue and its crappy acting. basically some moments are way better then others but the blending with zombies and heavy rock isnt great. the suspenseful piano music in the game is better and the games themselves are way better. Anderson directed a ok but boring movie to a great and horrific video game. a dissapointment really
3,I love Milla,"I wasn't expecting much when I began watching Resident Evil, so I was not so much disappointed with it. The plot is completely non-existent, the scenes just an excuse to lots of shots, punchs, kicks, etc. You know from the beginning who is the bad guy, how the end is going to be, all that. The low point of the movie is Michelle Rodriguez, from whose face we understand she's suffering severe pains in some kind of vital organ (in the real life, not in the movie). The high point is Milla Jovovich, more beautiful than ever. She is the only reason for someone to watch Resident Evil more than once. Milla is not hysteric like in ""Joan of Arc"", and not stupid like in ""The fifth element"". She is plainly gorgeous, and her almost-gone kind of voice is very atractive.I give Resident Evil three stars: one for some of the action scenes, who were well done, and two for Milla, one for each of her lovely blue eyes.Grade: 5.1/10"
4,RESIDENT EVIL ON GAMECUBE IS BETTER,THE R.E. FANS REALLY WANTED TO SEE A FILM THAT LOCKED LIKE THE 3 FRIGHTENING SCARY GAMES ALSO THE BOX COVER LOCKED QUITE STUPID TO ME I HOPE THE SEQUEL WILL BE BETTER
3,Pleasing but...,"As a fan of all the video games I was thrilled when I heard the long awaited movie was finally hitting theatres. The first dissapointment to me was the story. I hoped it would have all the classic characters from the game. Also, I wish the movie was in the mansion, however, I soon got over this as I watched because there were some redeeming qualities. Anybody can say their thirst for zombies was fulfilled as I have never seen so many on a screen since Night of the Living Dead. Also, the movie is very suspensful and there a few slow instances. There were some jumpy times but I wouldn't classify this as a horror movie...(its more action). This movie is a lot of fun and a good rent but I probably would not buy it. The story brought the grade down a full star because even after watching it a second time I still didn't fully understand what was going on. So its up to you. A good rental for a party with friends but nothing more. 7/10"
2,Good but could have been so much better..,"this movie is fun...no doubt about it!!! great action sequences....decent zombies(not as scary as george a. romero's zombie versions) great ""licker"" sequence!! movie didnt have as much suspense or mystery as the video game, which definitely hurt my viewing experience! in the game it was a mystery as to why there was a mansion in the middle of the mountains...and in the game, you didnt find out who exactly the ""umbrella"" corporation was until 3/4 the way through the game's storyline..in the movie, its just all laid out in front of you...no real surprise. the red queen addition also hurt the story!! they should have been fighting zombies all the time!!!not some stupid computer!! bottom line: if they had just followed the videogame story and not made their own, this would have been a 5+ star movie. the two stars are for the zombies, the zombie dogs, and the ""licker"" sequence!!! the acting lost it a star."
4,A good time for all.,"Frankly, I can't STAND the Resident Evil video games; they're slow and pointless. But for some reason, I truly enjoyed the movie. Maybe it's because it has nothing to do with the games; or maybe it's because I just enjoy seeing zombies get killed. Whatever it is, I recommend this movie to anyone who's in the mood for a solid action flick."
4,Decent View from Game fan,I have played all of the RE games and this movie was better than expected the story line was decent the acting was good and the effects where niceHowever there is not much to relate to the game thats my reason for 4 rather than5
3,Entertaning,"My biggest annoyance with this movie is the fact that it has almost nothing to do with the original video game. The other thing that annoys me is the fact that 2/3 of the characters are killed in about 5 minutes and we don't even get to really know half of them. Other than that the visual style, special effects, and story of the movie all add together to produce an entertaining sci-fi horror movie that will hopefully not cause an outrage amongst die hard fans of the video games. This isn't meant to be a re-make of the first game, but it does use some similar elements and some completely knew ones. If you enjoy Paul Anderson's other works such as Soldier, Event Horizon, and/or AvP, you'll probably like this. If you only go for Spielberg type movies than stay away from this at all costs."
5,This looks fantabular!,"I, personally, think this will be a great movie (better than tomb raider by far). Most of the plot runs along with the original resident evil one game, with few exceptions (the red queen, new characters, etc.). I don't think that these new additions to the storyline will destroy the movie, unlike some people believe. I'm also glad to see that Josh Hartnett isnt in this as well, considering he's playing all different kinds of movies.I believe this does take place in the umbrella lab and underneath raccoon city (as did the first/second video games). I am not really sure, though, if our heroes will be going to the mansion. I didn't catch that part, but no matter, I think it will be a great thrill. By the way, don't listen to this kid from ""phenix"", he is criticizing the movie before it comes out and he can barely spell.But anyways, I'm going to see it today! I'm so psyched!"
4,OK,This is ok ... the following series are great. You have to watch this to understand the movies after this one. this sets the plot.
4,Pretty Good,"I dont like video games to be turned into movies. However, this is a pretty good movie. (Not to mention Mila Naked) It lacked something along the way, and the super creature zombies [were bad]. The dog zombies were the best part of the film, and its worth watching just to see them, and mila naked. Definately worth watching."
4,"Could this be the fabled ""Director's Cut""?","I've heard a lot about an unrated director's cut of this movie with more gore and violence. I think the Superbit edition would be a great opportunity to showcase a new version of the film.As for the movie in general, Paul Anderson is the only person to make video game movies. There have only been two good ones (this one and Mortal Kombat) and he directed both of them. The second MK, Tomb Raider, Super Mario, and whatever else you want to throw in there have all been horrible. This is a good movie if you haven't played the games. And if you have, it's a great movie..."
4,Milla kicks!,"I've never played the game, and quite frankly, had no expectations for this movie at all. The friends I took to the movie with me had played all the games, and I myself was a fan of the lead actress Milla Jovovich ever since 'The 5th Element.' What surprised my friends and I about this movie was, even though it is basically a slasher flick, I got scared! They built up suspense through thoughtful story telling, and the characters were not obnoxious teenie boppers obessed with sex, drugs and rock'n'roll. If you're into action or horror movies, you'll like this. Don't expect depth, just fun."
4,"Flawed, But Very Good","I would rate the video game movies like this:1- Resident Evil2- Mortal Kombat3- Final Fantasy4- Tomb Raider5- Mortal Kombat: Anilation6- Double Dragon7- Street FighterThe history of video game movies has been rocky, but this one restores my faith in the genre. I saw it twice in the theatre, and I will be watching it a infinite amount of times on DVD. Something I did not like about it was the lack of gore. That is something Resident Evil [the game] had been known for. But it did not disappoint me as much as other games to movie adaptations. It starts out with a fatal mistake of a virus being unleashed in a place called The Hive. A computer then kills everyone in the building. A elite team of soldiers has been sent to clean up the mess. It's ending leaves it wide open for a sequel, which I really REALLY want to see. Mill Jovovich gives a great performance in the movie along with the other actors. This is a good movie and you will most likely enjoy it."
4,Resident Evil,"While The Resident Evil video game series prides itself on its moody atmosphere the movie goes for a louder approach. Personally i prefer to consider the movie as a separate entity. Recap: after a dangerous virus escapes from an underground lab a team of specially trained agents are sent to investigate only to discover zombies and other nasty surprises. It's funny i'd never noticed how stunningly gorgeous Milla Jovovich is and she kicks A$$, Michelle Rodriguez does an ok job but she basically plays the same part in every movie (the tough girl). Personally i felt the characters bonded into a family, i felt towards the end the characters actually cared for each other. The final showdown on the train was very reminiscent of RE2 (Video Game) and very exciting. Overall an action packed adventure that provides nothing new but worth watching anyway. EP"
3,Didn't luv it didn't hate it,I admit there were times wen it put u on edge and lots of suspense and the special effects weren't half bad but were as a lot of ppl probably liked the storyline I didn't really buy into it and I thought it could've been more scary
1,paul w.s.anderson you SUCK,what have they done to resident evil this movie is crap the story is so basic it reminds me of zombie 3 but edleast that was funny this is not even funny its just dull. resident evil the game kicked ass it was scery and the zombies looked cool they wer roting and looked dead but the zombies in the film wer just guy's with white face paint on and normaly when a zombie bits someone it draws BLOOD not in this film the zombies seem to like liking guys heads just whach the scene when the guy gets draged in to the lift and the CGI in this film is worse than the spawn movie.George A. Romero was going to direct this movie he evan had is own script and iv red it and it was much beter than this crap film and paul anderson thinks he is going to direct alien VS predator i hope he dosent coz he SUCKS he hasont done one good film ever paul anderson dont quit yor day job coz you SUCK
5,A Smash Hit!,"Resident Evil was a big hit, going to #1 in the box offices. I've seen it and plan on buying it as soon as it comes out, or as soon as it comes out for pre-order. If you've played any of the games of resident evil, and liked them, then, trust me, you'll LOVE this movie! But if you haven't played the games, I don't recommend it, since you need to know what's going on. It basically follows the game perfectly, with awesome graphics and a cliff-hanger ending that makes you know that they are going to make another one! So I definitly recommend this movie to the game fans!!"
2,NOT all that,"I can tell you R.E. is nothing like its ""hyped"" up to be. advertisments make it look like the scariest movie of our time. I admit, it was cool to see a bunch of infected zombies walkin around eating people, but the background of the movie was horrible. The entire first 45 minutes were the most boring 45 minutes of any movie. it gets better, but the zombies arent scary at all and it just needs more suspense. the entire movie was a sinch to predict. Thats what makes it bad. If you go to see a horror movie and you can predict when there will be a zombie at every turn, its not gonna be that scary. the graphics were ok, but it just didnt have that ""ew >:-("" and ""ahhhhhhhh <=-0"" like the game. the point i'm trying to make is that the 2nd R.E. movie is gonna need a lot of work to get a good rating from me."
5,Resident Evil review from 11 year old Kevin Koslo,"I think that resident evil will be an excellent movie (although I haven't seen it yet). I especially think that one of them did excellent which would be Milla Jovovich!!!! I mean Milla would do excellent in a movie like that, and wait til the people see the next one. So if the that say ""IT SUCKS"" see this the'll go crazy, extemely crazy. So thats what I think!!!!!!!!!"
2,Y'know what? You ain't miss'n much here...,"I'm reviewing this movie because after renting it (thank god!), I had a very good mental vision of how cool this action/horror slasher flick would be, little did I know that dissapointment was just around the corner...I mean, wow, they really screwed up here with one of Playstation's most popular video games in history.I wanted blood, but there was barely ANY, what were they thinking? Resident Evil is all about the blood 'n the zombies, which mind you, not EVEN ONE get's it's head blown off, which is how you kill them idiots! No wonder Alice's team suffered so much! The most redeeming, interesting part of the movie is the way it tries to give suspense and surprise, it fails on some levels to say the least but it is the best feature.The way the movie ends is stupid too, it basically ENDS where it should've BEGUN, thus resulting to a tiresome sequel that may I say was a total flop!Might be pleasing to some, but I've seen better..."
1,A real bone movie!,"Yeah it's geared to teenie boppers... And that's who'll probably like it till they get to see some real zombie flicks!In my top 5 worst movies ever. Borrows heavilly from other films, incoherent script, inept characterications, crummy CGI, crummy editing and camera... Just all around crummy! As far as an action movie centered around a female hero? I rather watch BarbWire! Yes it's that BAD! 'Nuff said!"
1,Just plain bad,"I thought this movie was horrible. I'm shocked that anyone has written a good review of it.I love action movies. I love movies based on video games. I love to watch women kick [butt]. So I naturally thought I would enjoy this movie. I was very, very wrong. Don't waste your money."
1,"An ""Evil"" Movie - How could this be good?","A friend of a friend went to see this overblown mess of a movie, despite my warnings and boy, did he receive the disappointment of his life. Just look at the previews, even they look like a disaster. Why make an action film this bad and THEN give it a theatrical release? Still curious? Here is the movie in a nutshell, its a very simple formula folks: throw in every tired action/horror/scifi film cliche, add an annoying heavy metal music soundtrack, base the 'plot' on a boring/simplistic computer game (kill the zombie, find a key, open the door using the key, repeat), add plenty of gore and a hoochie female lead and mix. What do you get? A wasted evening at the theatre and a headache."
1,Resident Dreadful,"So far the worst film of the young millennium, ""Resident Evil,"" based on the video game series, is sheer torture for all of its 100 minutes. There is absolutely nothing redeeming about it whatsoever. The only frightening parts of this wreck are the dreadful script, the haggard plot (people blast a bunch of zombies while trying to shut down a supercomputer in an underground lab), and weak acting by equally weak actors. Milla Jovovich is a far cry from Angelina Jolie as a respectable female action hero, no matter how hard the media tries to incite a rivalry between them. If you were foolish enough to actually pay money to watch this, then immediately go home and cleanse your soul with the superior ""Tomb Raider."" Enough said."
3,Keep it to the games please...,"Being a huge fan of the games and a huge horror fan, i was excited when i heard about this. But that soon vanished after seeing the movie. Poor special effects and CG, coupled with characters i didn't give a crap about wasn't much insentive to watch to the end but i gave it a go. It didn't really get much better. A few good scenes and the original Licker were ok, but all in all it's not one to rush out and buy right away. And if you are gonna get it, don't expect too much. Enjoy!"
3,Not bad,"This movie isn't as bad as they say, has intrigue and mystery, an of course the gorgeous Milla Jovovich. The bad part in the movie it's when Milla begins to have flashbacks and the heavy metal music. Or the bad special effects of the lickers. This isn't one of those bad zombie movies made with 4 dollars in the pocket, you never know what will happen around corner. And the movie ends with a surprise nobody expects, shocking."
5,"Great Movie, but noting like the games","this movie has been torn apart by viewers and critics and i just cant stand it! this movie wasnt that bad! its got great music (not the slipknot crap but the instrumental pieces are great!) one thing i was disapointed about was the complete story change from the game to this! its practically noting like it except for the fact of flesh eating zombies. if this film was based on the novel by S.D. Perry it would have been amazing but they decided to go original. its still a great movie but i just wish it was based on the novelization done for the first game! the thing i was very happy with was the ending. its not sad but its not good. its got the perfecvt lead off to a sequel. i only hope its based off of either resident evil 2 or resident evil 3: nemesis. if so, its gonna rock!"
3,decent horror flick with a kick-... soundtrack,"first off, if you're expecting the movie to be exactly out of the game, you may be in for at least a little bit of a letdown... however, if you're anticipating that is simply based on the game series, you will probly like it... and listen to the soundtrack... the music by Manson at the end is killer!"
2,Dull Teen Fare,"I was quite disappointed with this movie. The music is high quality teen fare (the youngsters seemed to like it). Don't have high expectations of the film however if you are a hard core horror/sci-fi fan. This is no ""Dawn of the Dead"" or ""Evil Dead"". Wait for the cable release - there is nothing in this film that can't be shown on cable."
1,Resident Evil,"I watched most of it then skipped to the end.The beginning was promising- the special op type guys were cool & professional-especially their commander. Some of the special effects were cool. But all in all I was disappointed. Perhaps if I were better aquainted with the video game I may have enjoyed it more. I'd have to say though that the ""R"" rating is well deserved-that is ""R"" for Ridiculous or ""R"" for ""Rent only if you are a hard core fan"""
4,Wheres the Ketchup?,"A Zombie film with no gore?...surely not!!However, it almost works...almost. Paul Andersons not done too bad a job with it considering i thought they were gonna turn it into a pg13 when Romero left the production, but far too many movies have been pillaged in it (Matrix, Dawn of the Dead, Aliens, Cube) so if you seen any of these films youll be seeing the same thing but in a slightly different way. Acting is occasionally dodgy but bearable. Overall a good film, if youre a fan of RE of course. Sequel should be better."
3,Not what I expected...,"First of all, I'm a big Resident Evil fan, the game that is. But this movie is just a little disappointing. The sound is off somehow, sounds like they are far away or something. One would think that they would at least spend a bit more money to help support one of the best game series ever created. I did like seeing Milla kick some ass in a skirt though."
5,killer movie,resident evil is all good its just about like the game i loved this movie and would say this is a must see
3,not the video game,"Im a fan of the video games, and have played them all,as a fan of the games I was a little dissapointed, butall in all, re is not a bad flick, I do recomend it, toall horror, and action film fans.for the game fans the ending is probably the best part,and hopefuly, the next one will be more to my taste."
5,"Not like the game, but better!","When I first heard about the movie, I was sceard. Why because of past game movies... I wont say any names but I think you can guess.I am a Resident Evil fan and when the movie hit theaters I was't sure what it would be like. Well after seeing it and knowing what it was based upon, I was very impressed... It had some conection with the game, but was different all in the same."
4,I can't believe this was such a good movie,"First off, you should realize just by the title that this is a popcorn flick. It focuses on horror, suspense, gore, big guns, and the occassional naked Jojovich. I watched this movie on a whim, expecting it to be horrible drek. After all, it's based on a computer game (which I've never played) and the previews were AWFUL. However, against all odds, I found myself absolutely LOVING this movie. Great beginning, great suspense, great pacing, great soundtrack, and a great ending that keeps on giving you more just when you're afraid it's over. Let's put it this way: I have a little under 200 movies in my collection, and this has just become one of my favorites. This is not intellectual or deeply moving -- but it is fun as heck."
4,Resident Evil UMD Review,"Ok, If you are a die hard original RE fan you should really go see this movie.. Although it does not stick to the original story line as in the Playstation version of the game, It does however touch on some of the events. I rated it 4 stars only because I thought If they actually sticked with the original story, they would have made for a really good movie. You know.. Creeping around an old Mansion and finding trap doors and having zombies fly out at you.. Im so addicted to the original game.. that it is somewhat sad.. The game just rocks..Anyways, getting back to the movie, if you love zombie movies and played alot of Resident Evil.. this is a must see... It's definetly filled with action and gives you more of an idea on how the T-VIRUS came about, and how evil the Umbrella Corporation can be."
1,No coupon,"Great movie, great DVD. But be warned -- the copy I received from Amazon did not include the promised coupon."
1,"AWFUL and DULL, DULL, DULL!","The most boring horror film in years. Bad CGI FX, stupid rubber dogs and pathetic pace and plot. NO horror, no surprises. Don't give Anderson another chance. He is a hopless director and this is proof final. The most tedious zombie film EVER made. JUNK in every way."
1,Resident Evil,"I think the adult should buy this dvd because it has lots of violents,nudity,gore,kill people too. And in the movie it is not the same video game you see at the video store and you look at the video game the games is mature. Why because if your child is like to kill all of the zombines in this game do not get this video game for them to get their birthday or their christmas present at all"
1,Not very scary....,"As a gore-fest it works. But, it is NOT scary, eerie, dramatic, convincing, in-depth, original, or based on the game. It is only partially based on the award-winning highly successful video game. If it followed the game closer, it might have been a masterpiece."
3,Residual Evil?,"I hope the negative media reviews of Tomb Raider and Final Fantasy don't cling to RE before it debuts.I think it should stay exactly like the game.Paul Andreson said using Jill and co., fans would know who was killed and who survived.Yet,reading the reviews on the website Anderson ALREADY TELLS YOU who's going to live and die.So much for that reason! Being an overseas film,having B-rated actors/actoress+ its's a horror flick,it probably will dive.I love the game and have the action figures but I also know the film industry.So here's to the hope of being wrong and it becomes a smash (at least for them to make 2 and 3) P.S. Why is it so hard for directors,producers etc.to appease gaming fans and such and do remakes and game movies just like the originals?"
3,The last 5 minutes...,of this movie is what made the rest of the movie bearable. Milla's outfit? Yummmmm......
1,"Special effects look exactly like that of a computer game, not real. + Over the top action + No plot = Not woth watching.","The pecial effects look exactly like that of a computer game, not real. The action is the top. There's no plot. It's not woth watching."
3,It's good - but,"Here's the problem. The filmmaker - one Paul Anderson - discards the whole survival horror premise in exchange for a straight action shoot-em-up film. The result - the fun of the game is lost. The film is at its best when the characters come up against hordes of zombies - including a really cool homage to both Day and Dawn of the dead involving intestines. But there is absoloutely no wit to the film - it wants to take itself too seriously. And that is the biggest problem. This film should have been fun, campy, and have absoloutely no regard for itself as a serious film. Instead, it tries to scare with the subtlety of a smack on the back of the head - and fails."
3,Cheesey,"All the reviews gave it good reviews which is understandable for an earlier zombie movie. but having to buy it kinda sucked, because i just wanted to rent it. not worth the money"
2,"Superbit DVD, not a reference one.","My review is for the SUPERBIT release of this movie. SUPERBIT is supposed to represent the top of the line and best image quality a DVD can achieve and many times those DVDs are actually reference DVDs. Well, the quality in this SUPERBIT edition of RESIDENT EVIL is so so, not bad not good, just like any other DVD. It certainly does not do justice to the SUPERBIT term. Other DVDs that honor the SUPERBIT name are the FIFTH ELEMENT and THE BIG HIT version but this version is nothing to talk about. It is not as terrible as the other SUPERBIT DVD or Charlie's Angels but if you are buying this DVD for reference or video quality purposes look elsewhere."
3,Good fun for a guys night out.,"First off I would like to address the idea that ""Resident Evil"" is a ""Pure Horror"" and not an action game. Have you people been living in the past. The game is based solely on action. The horror aspect was stuck in to give the genre a twist. Every Resident evil game was built around the shoot'em up concept. additionally, if anyone saw the previews before they decided to spend money on the movie would easily have known that this was a no-brainer, action flick. If you expected anything else then you shouldn't be writing reviews for anything.Needless to say, the movie was not the greatest movie ever made. It wasn't even close. But I can say it was fun to watch. I would like to see where they take the story to in the next movie, ""Resident Evil: Nemesis"" in the works now."
5,Best game based movie yet!,Although there were no characters from the actual game in the movie there were quite a few things that fans will be able to immediately notice. Certain scenes are recognizable and the graphics and fx kick ... . The movie itself actually takes place before the first game and ends around the time Resident Evil 2 ends and 3 begins. ... Only thing bad about it is there are no deleted scenes available to watch. Definately buy this movie and you won't regret it.
4,The best video game adapted to a movie,I was pleasantly surprised at how solid this movie was. The first 5 minutes are the most intense moments I've spent watching a film in a long time. I was skeptical because most movies that were video games suck badly. The movie had me thoroughly entertained and on the edge of my seat the whole time. I can't wait for it to come out on DVD.
4,Finally...it came 8D,"Well, I have heard like 3 years ago that a Resident Evil movie is being made...Well, it finally came (= I thought the movie was well action packed and had many thrilling parts to it. There were barely any flaws, but what I thoguht that kind of [stunk] is that they didn't have Jill Valentine in the movie..? She is like the main character of every resident evil series ( xcept for RE2, Code Veronica..). But from what people are saying that she will appear in the next movie...I will be happy to see that (= Another reason is that they had a licker play in the movie....Why didn't they use the Tyrant!? He is the main villan not a licker )= Oh well, the movie is still awesome and is highly recommended of watching, so, have fun (="
4,Resident Evil,This was the first Resident Evil film that I had ever watched. Found it to be very interesting. Really I enjoyed it!
4,13-year-olds review,"I do admit i am young to be watching a horror movie but i thought it was brill.I didnt know much about resident evil,but i have completed all the games and want to read the book.I say the movie is a must for any resident evil collection,the plot was fantastic and the actors were brill.I really cant wait unitl the next one comes out!!!!"
3,Popcorn movie,Good to watch with your respective other with big bag of popcorn. I'm definitely considering on watching the whole saga.
3,Great but not so great,"I first saw this movie in theatres, where it was extremely scary, disturbing, and creepy. I anticipated and jumped at every scene. Once it transferred to video, it lost something. The DVD version just lacked the horror. NO doubt it is a stylish, sleek film with incredible special effects and a great soundtrack. It just lacks all convincing scariness..."
4,A really great movie!,"I knew that this movie was based on a computer game that my husband and his friends played, so I was a little hesitant about seeing it. I had heard it got bad reviews when it was in the theaters and thought maybe they were right. However I was interested in a movie where a woman kicks a lot of booty and saves the day.Was I surprised!!!! This movie is so great! Its fun to watch and suspensful enough to keep you on the edge of your seat in many scenes. The gore factor is pretty high, but thats fine with me.The score to this movie is also AMAZING!! Im a huge Marilyn Manson fan and the soundtrack to the movie is just incredible! He really outdid himself, even my friends who do not like Marilyn Manson music liked the score to this movie.Ive seen this movie twice in a one month period and hope for a sequel! See it, its a fun movie and you wont be dissapointed."
4,"If you are expecting a shallow horror flic, it kicks","The first thing I do in an age where movies aren't very good is prepare myself to watch something. Take for example tomb raider. I went to the movie expecting a rather stupid movie with a hot girl blowing stuff up. I left 100% satisified. Now this movie. Two hot girls blowing up zombies.... Cool. Not the deepest plot but hey someone has to kill the zombies right? Anyway it is a cool movie that was done well, execpt for the alien animation, and I would recommend it so long as you are not looking to give it an award."
2,One of the worst BD in months,"RE is a real deception. It could be a great edition if the poor definition was not so crearly. Good colour, but few extras. If you have the DVD-Video Superbit edition, avoid this BD."
4,Pretty good,"I thought the movie was ok but it was not one of my favorites.I loved the zombies,Milla Jovovich's character,and Michelle Rodriguez.Other than that it's ok.B+"
3,it's alright,"This is an...alright adaptation. There are much worse. The action scenes are cool, and the effects are pretty cool, but the zombies look pretty tacky. They aren't the half rotted brown sacks of maggot covered flesh that infest the game. They're these pale white half rotten things with no maggots at all! And where in the game does the Licker mutate?! That was ALL messed up!!! And some parts in this movie just suck, like when Kaplan dies(he's the best character), and when Milla Jovovich ends up being the last one to live. I don't care how hot she is or how unbelievably awesome she looks naked, the last person standing theme of horror movies is WAY too cliched!!! This movie is reccommended for someone who's a die hard fan of the video game series and/or headbangers(like myself)."
3,Deluxe?,I love Resident evil and purchased this since my old copy had stopped working. I figured I would buy the deluxe instead of just the normal DVD but I must say there is honestly no difference what so ever and I would suggest just buying the normal DVD instead of the deluxe. But it did arrive very quickly and well packaged. I was just disappointed that the deluxe did not really have anything different or extra then just the regular copy.
5,Resident Evil,"A deadly virus that breaks out, zombies, and a crazed computer, what else can you ask for in a movie. This movie contains many elements that makes it a 5 star film, for instance, the film has a very well movie translation from the video game. Then to add to it, the beautiful and talented Michelle Rodriguez as a perfect pick of playing the role of Rain, and Milla Jovovich as Alice.The movie constantly keeps you wondering what will happen next, it is very suspensful...."
4,A Really Good Movie,"I loved it. The only flaes I found were the lack of creatures(I WANTED MY HUNTERS!!), and the fact that the people you feel bad for are who you have grown to HATE, or really dislike...Umbrella operatives. The movie answered the question ""Where did Nemisis come from?"". I liked what they did with the licker though. I give it a 4/5"
5,faithful to the game,The ending for the movie is a good setup for a sequel and will probably be similar th RE 2. I liked the fact that the ending explained who NEMESIS from RE 3 was and where it came from. I was pretty happy with the video game to movie transition.
4,Great Movie,"-Good-Resident Evil in my opinion was a great movie. I enjoyed the plot, characters, and effects. The zombies looked very realistic and the movie was very creative.-Bad-The reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because in the begininng I found the plot a little hard to follow. As movie went on I stared to understand it more.-Overall-If you watch this movie (which you should) make sure to pay close attention in the begining 10 - 20 minutes otherwise you may get a little lost. Overall great movie, recomend it to everyone and stongly recommend it to Sci-Fi fans."
2,Too boomy.,"Well made, very sturdy shop radio has a bass boost that you cannot turn off. Everything but classical music booms out with so much bass that I cannot hear lyrics. Talk radio is hopeless. The results are loud but unsatisfactory - sure to disturb all your neighbors.Radio would be SO much better if it had a bass-boost off switch. It's a shame. Hey guys, how about adding tone control knobs?"
3,fatal flaw,"Initially most impressive. Heavy- looks indestructible. Invested in charger, rechareable d cells when I purchased, intending to carry out to farm, woods. But cover of electrical cord niche flopped open as I lifted out of box. Latch makes term ""rugged"" laughable. Thin, flimsy plastic. Tried- simply cannot be reglued- plastic too thin. What now- load up with batteries, carry with cord hanging behind, plastic lid flopping? Poor execution of details ruins otherwise good design, because it plays from aux input well and radio seems to have good sensitivity. Sound is very full for a battery powered speaker. A shame, really."
5,"Stylish, Suave theme tracks for Private Investigators","Of course, the cover art is striking. Palm trees framing a cat's eye moon over the golden gate bridge. A view only obtainable from Treasure Island. Its easy to forget that San Franscisco was the home of Sam Spade--a place where Vertigo could be made--Mort Sahl could tell topical jokes between jazz sets, or people would pass around a jug of wine at a poetry reading. This music has all the ambience of the cool, old, San Fransciso of pulp detective novels, beats and cool jazz. I absolutely totally do not understand the remarks of those reviewers who were disappointed in this cd. Comparisons with previous Aqua Velvets releases is unfair. This collection of tunes stands on its own merits. Those you you who don't get it--read the Maltese Falcon or The Big Sleep while you listen--it will start to make more sense to you."
5,"Mystery, Mystery",Nothing relaxes me like this disk after a hectic day at work! Just kick back with a dry Vodka Martini and fall into the trace the AV's induce. Also great background for a low-key and laidback party...
2,Not as good as Nomad,"I was disappointed in this CD. I have a copy of their earlier collection, Nomad, which is one of the best New Surf releases ever. This doesn't compare. I got this CD expecting a more subdued atmosphere with a little mystery and espionage thrown in. Unfortunately, they sound like a bad Vegas Lounge act. I should know, I live in Vegas. My advice would be to skip this CD and pick up Nomad instead. I hate to say that because I really do like The Aqua Velvets. Maybe next time."
4,A good knife with the right balance,"This knife is one of my favorites from my Mundial Future set. It has a nice rocking motion. I have a set of about eight of the Mundial Future knives, but this knife is the only one in the set that stands out from the rest. My daughter liked it well enough to put it on her Christmas list.The steel isn't the highest quality, but the knife has survived about three years of daily use. I keep it sharp, but I have not noticed any wear.My hands are big, and I'd like a little more height to the knife, so that my knuckles wouldn't hit the cutting board as much, but the entire Mundial line seems a little chintzy in that regard."
2,Not recommended...,"Definitely not recommended... This book is not written for beginners and I doubt if it will help experienced Python programmers. The examples, screen shots and the sample programs are offensive and irrelevant. The entire book gives one the impression that it was put together by works of other's, all stringed together. I will return my copy and get a return if it has any value left!"
2,Choose another book as beginner,"Even the French translation seems to be very low, corresponding to the criticism done in English. You better purchase another book as beginner in Python..."
2,You'll need more than 24 hours,"I bought this book hoping it would be a gentle yet thoroughintroduction to the Python language which I had hoped to use for webapplications. And the book started out along that track. Easy to read and lively and with lots of examples. The big problem I have with the book (and I only made it to hour 12 before I had to quit) is that there is no way for the reader to practice and learn the concepts in the book. There aren't any practice exercises or drills. There are screen dumps of code, but I didn't find the examples useful since I was looking for web-based applications rather than more mathematical types of examples. The examples also get very big and complex early on in the book. Experienced programmers will probably be able to follow along, but then they might not be buying this book in the first place. I'm still looking for a good, step-by-step way to learn Python."
2,Hard to follow,"Although the book claims to be written for the novice programmer, I don't think it is really suited to such a reader. Throughout the book, the author introduces things without explanation. This is particularly a problem with the code samples. Most of the code in the book is taken from other projects that the author had worked on and is often not very illustrative of the points he is trying to make. Also, much of the code has parts that are unexplained. If I had not already been familiar with a few other languages, I don't think I could have followed this book at all.Finally, although Python is often used for text processing tasks like sys admin, cgi, etc., almost all the examples in this book revolve around calendrical calculations. Maybe fascinating for the author, but agonizingly dull for me."
2,Not Recommended...,"This book looked good when I started reading it, and even though I read through the whole thing and learned a few concepts about OO and Python it is definetly not a beginner's book. Hard to follow and the examples are basically all about mayan calendrical calculations. One thing i will say for this book is that the chapters on Tcl/Tk were quite good."
1,Don't buy this book,"You are better off reading the help and intro files at the python website than buying this book. There are numerous times where code is not explained and you have to figure things out more so than you would expect from a book that costs you money.Though you can understand what the program does, the actual meanings of script and calls are left unexplained; this book lacks the precision needed to explain programming and obscures a simple and powerful language like python. This book could not possibly teach you python in 24 hours, nor will it do anything but confuse and frustrate the inexperienced programmer."
2,may get side effects,"When using this product, you might get a headache. When i used it, it didn't agree with me. So make sure you do a little research on it before you buy it."
3,"Effective, but nasty.","I have suffered with what my doctor labeled as ""IBS"" for a little over a year now. Through my own research, I found that the cause might be low stomach acid. I did the unintelligent thing and started on Betaine HCL without consulting my doctor. (You should always consult your doctor.)I have to say it's helping a great deal. I'm no longer ""sick"" every morning. I can eat meat again. If this is such a help, why 3 stars?Have you ever owned a reptile, or had other cause to breed crickets? Have you ever had a large die-off where you keep said insects?The smell is literally exactly the same. These pills also have an incredibly strong aftertaste, which, sadly, is the same.There are other brands around which are not disgusting. Look for them."
5,Exactly as expected,"Shipped quickly, fit and are exactly as described and expected. Work perfectly in unit, great value and will definately order more"
1,German style knife,"This knife might bear the Santoku label but it's really just a big heavy German style knife with soft steel. Don't get this if you're looking for a light, nimble and hardened steel vegetable knife.The knife arrived overground towards the hilt and much of the blade did not make contact with the cutting board.Unimpressive knife."
3,pen refills,I love the new cross edge. But when it comes to the refills for you pen..you definitely want to stick with the rolling ball gel refill. I say this because it writes so much more fluid and smooth compared to the ball point. When writing less effort and more finesse comes with the gel rollerball refills.
3,Rock the Poacher,"Ronnie Lane was one of the true british rockers. Nothing new, musically, but sounding really good. These two cd:s comes from different sources recorded during the gypsy caravan that turned out to be A financially disaster. But, do in an appropriate way show how the Ronnie Lane Slim Chance really sounded,when on tour in the circus tent. Rock Your Blues away, Guitars (electric & accustic) fiddle & mandolin + drums & bass & some accordion. However, if you dont have any records with the band, the one to get hold on, is ""ONE FOR THE ROAD. A five star album in any competition."
4,Too $hort does it again...,"This album, in my opinion, is easily one of $hort Dogg's best. The tracks flow smoothly with one another, and make this CD... believe it or not, relaxing and easy to knod your head to. I highly suggest purchasing this album, and checking it out for yourself. From other reviews, I can see I'm not the only one that believes $hort Dogg has done it again... this album is no exception in Too $hort's list of bumpin' albums. The beats, rhymes, and rhythms work perfect together. Don't miss out on this hip-hop classic."
4,Helpful book about TMJ,Very helpful information about TMJ and how it might get worse or better with splint/bite plate. Exercises and other helpful information.
3,TMJ can it rid you of teeth grinding?,"This is merely a relaxation medium. I felt like I was back in LaMaze class preparing for childbirth. It helps me to relax the jaw, something most people don't realize they are clinching when they go to sleep. I am more aware of it now, and tell myself to relax the jaw as I am falling off to sleep, but I still wear my teeth guard, without it I would not be able to eat the next day due to sore jaw."
1,Not what I expected,"I bought this CD thinking was going to be better than others I have tried but simply to me is not. Others I have bought seem to be lot better in time, quality and results. This cd lasts shorter than others I have heard, the instructor or man who did this cd moves to fast through the process of relaxation which I consider to fast compared with other cd's.Overall I did not like it much and I won't recommend it to someone who is looking for a deeper relaxation, smooth and slow process and a better relaxing voice. This guy does not even have the voice to relax me. Not worth the try unless you are willing to ask for a refund."
1,Disappointed,"I was hoping for a guided meditation CD that was specific to TMJ. However, this CD was simply a nondescript single hypnosis session. If your unfamiliar with medical hypnosis, this CD will not further your understanding, nor will it explain the process and benefits of such practices. I would not recommend this CD if your struggling with TMJ."
5,"Good, very good",I like this book a lot! But definately read the companion novel (79#) before this one! I loved that character Tessa. She was very nice!
2,THIS BOOK WAS AWFUL!,"THIS BOOK was so dumb. All it was was, like most Saddle Club books, about snobs trying to act know-it-allish, and regular girls trying to get revenge! There wasn't even that much stuff about horses! Don't waste your money."
3,A quick note on the remastering,"To all the reviewers who have complained about the drum roll at the start of ""Shake Dog Shake"" being edited, this is not the case. It's all there, but has been remastered such that it commences a fraction of a second prior to the start of track 1. To hear the beginning, you have to press play, then search backwards into the 2 second pre-gap. (Mind you, not all CD players will do this.) I think it's most unlikely this was done intentionally, and believe it to be a remastering error. An annoying one, yes, but not as bad as if they'd clipped off the beginning completely!"
4,Underrated,"The Top is the last of the three albums that resulted from the Pornography fall out (excluding the japanese whispers singles). The first of the three was The Glove release Blue Sunshine and the Second was the Banshee's album Hyeana. So one could imagine that an artist who had already contributed musical ideas to two album wouldnt have much left but somehow robert smith pulls it together. Especially on the achingly beautiful ""Empty World"" and the pop masterpiece the Caterpillar. Sure at times it is apparent that Robert is searching terribly hard for ideas (Bananafishbones). But for the majority of the time Roberts experimints are successful, like on the title song and Dressing Up. Although the album is technically a cure album it is essentially a solo album. Robert Smith described the recording process as him sitting in a room and banging on anything he could to make some music. But its the music not the story that matters and the music is astonishingly good."
2,"Yes, Shake Dog Shake is cut","4 stars for the album, 2 docked because of the mastering screw up.As the previous reviewer said... my copy also has a couple of seconds or so missing from the beginning of Shake Dog Shake. That may not seem like much time, but it does ruin the effect of the intro. Why, why, WHY can't these record companies get these remasters right? We fans buy this stuff over and over and they keep screwing them up."
3,Different,"Strange tunes from a strange group. Robert Smith makes Morrissey sound cheerful! Top is not one of my favourite Cure albums. In fact, I consider it as mediocre. Wasn't it for The Caterpillar, it would be a big flop. (That's why I gave it 3 stars and not just 2!) But on the other hand, buy Standing On The Beach, Caterpillar is included there too together with all their terrific songs. Avoid Top!"
3,The Top,"The Top was the Cure's 1984 release and their 5th studio album and it sure is experimental and contained the hit ""The Caterpillar"". The lyrics are quite avantgarde and to be honest for most of the time I have no idea what Robert Smith is singing about. The booklet has some weird graphics on the front and the lyrics are quite difficult to read. 3/5."
3,You spin me 'round,"Quirky, strange, excellent for fingerpainting on a rainy day. ""The Top"" is like a practice run for ""Head on the Door""---brillance shines through, but it would take a couple of years before full-blown genius took shape (and ""Head.."" remains one of my favorite all time albums ever, since that first listen in the fall of '85). ""Top"" is essential for anyone who wants to understand the evolution of a seminal band--those with short attention spans need not apply."
2,hmmmm,"The Top is definitely the strangest cure album available. This album is extremely eclectic and at times is embarrassingly stupid. However there are a few decent tracks on this one and there is a feeling of energy which is lacking on some of the late Cure albums. Unfortunately like the Cures latest album ""The Cure"", The Top has too much rubbish material on it to make it worth your time. However, for what its worth I do prefer this album to Wild Mood Swings and The Cure.Overall, the general public should stay away from this one and only Cure fans should bother."
5,Psycho Brilliance,"This album pulls the listener in from the beginning with the powerful song ""Shake Dog Shake"". ""Birdmad Girl"" is fun and whimsical, ""Bannanafishbones"" is just a fun song with crazy lyrics and psychedelic keyboards. Other songs are haunting and eerie, such as ""Wailing Wall"", ""The Empty World"", and ""Give Me It"". ""The Top"" is a beautifully disturbing song. The more I listen to this album, the more I like it. This album is close to being a solo effort by Robert Smith and offers a wonderful glimpse into his unique and twisted psyche."
4,Still Relevant in the 90's. Or wait -- the 00's!,"""Class carries clout,"" says the author. The appearance and behavior of the upper middle class are key to success in many social situations, including sales and business. For example, if you are at a formal dinner, which fork do you use? Much of the time the answer may not matter at all. But as you move up the ladder, you will encounter more and more people who do have upper middle class breeding and who expect that behavior from those they would trust and do business with. Is this book essential? Not to lots of folks. But for someone who wishes to examine class head-on, the book is an excellent overview. And like the rest of Molloy's books, it is based on scientific research, not opinions or ""wishing how it ought to be."""
5,Very enjoyable book.,"Even though this book was written over 20 years ago, it has a lot of real-life experiences that prove useful throughout the decades."
5,This was my first deck,This is not a hard deck to use. This has the easiest meaning book that comes with the deck that simplifies meanings short and concise. Don't have to over complicate anything. Just gives you the option. My meaning book is taped and stapled but I still have it. It was my starter deck and I have abused my cards badly since I was 18 and enjoyed many accurate readings and it still is my favorite deck. I am sad that its out of print because the deck is cool. Will probably buy another because I do love this deck. Anyone who likes traditional medieval cards will love this deck.
3,NRNS 3 Review!,"Not as hysterically bad as the first two movies but still a laugh-fest, NRNS 3 brings back Avedon (though he plays a different part) and teams him with Keith Vitali as two brothers, one of them is a C.I.A. agent with MacGyer-like problem solving abilties and the other is a karate teacher with a bus stop inside his dojo. When their dad gets iced by the goofiest super-villian ever, the brothers go their seperate ways on a mission of revenge.Vitali tries to smooth things over with his estranged girlfriend while Avedon enlists the help of his old drinking buddies. Things get intense when a double agent sets them up and Avedon is forced to kidnap some goofy-looking African Embasaddor. In one of the funniest things I have ever seen, Vitali's girlfriend starts shooting at Avedon because he neglected to inform her that he is his brother. Well, I don't want to give it all a way but if you love bad action movies, this one is a hoot."
5,"Excellent book, but know in advance....","Excellent book, but know in advance that this book is heavily skewed toward legal topics and lawyer authors. While much of the legal writing is dense for lay readers, it is often well worth the effort. The selections authored by Margaret Montoya, Kevin Johnson, editor Richard Delgado, and non-attorney Gloria Anzaldua were the very best of this remarkably well-written anthology."
3,"Slick, pop-oriented British reggae","Aswad are most notable for being the first British reggae group signed to a major label. But their music is worth investigating to some degree. They construct an interesting reggae-based blend of pop, funk, and dub.They've risen and fallen in popularity several times throughout their career, and this compilation charts all aspects of their work admirably. Probably the ""best"" track is their first no. 1 single, a 1988 cover of Tina Turner's ""Don't Turn Around"" (later made more successful by Ace of Base).But many of the other, more political reggae songs are more interesting. Worth the investigation if you're a fan of reggae, or of British black music."
1,Family Wilderness Adventure/Part 1 & 2,"Although, this video is informative about an everyday family backpacking through the wilderness, it is certainly not worth more than the cost of a blank VHS tape. This is no more than a home made family video, about a wilderness adventure. Unless you enjoy watching someone elses home video, don't buy it."
4,Once is not enough!,"I had this cassette back in 1992. I lost it then forgot who the artists were. I liked it so much that I went on a one year search to find if I could replace it. Thanks to Jellys in Aiea, HI for hooking me up with the name of the artists. I just purchased cd through amazon and am anxiously awaiting delivery. Once is not enough!"
3,Solid reggae covers.,"Great beach groovin' tunes, but the album lacks a complete list - there are far too many filler songs. Kotch needs a greatest hits album."
5,Da Bes,"Kotch has brought good flavour here to hawai'i with the hit songs like "" two occasions "", "" Tears "" ans soo forth. it's pretty good if u like contemporary,reggae,jawaiian music."
4,Powerful Pop release from Amy Lepard,"Amy Lepard fans wonder...when's the next release?!While ""Girl's Nite Out"" is the track that has garnered the most airplay/attention, every track gets a full-throttled, heartfelt performance. The only reason this wasn't given a 5 star rating is that it is obvious that her talents were limited by under-production in the recording process. This Texas singer deserves major label support and production on her next effort,for sure.Get a copy while you can, and catch a live show first chance!"
4,Pretty good,I've only read books 1-3 but I really loved them and I'm dying to find the other 3 books in the series...so if anyone has them and wouldn't mind lending them to a desperate aussie please do so! I'm very willing to pay for the shipping
3,"Great magazine, but.....","THIS IS A GREAT MAGAZINE, DON'T GET ME WRONG, I LOVE IT AND WILL CONTINUE TO SUBSCRIBE, but son't order from amazon. The reason their price here is so cheap is because they made a deal with the manufacturer that THEY DON'T INCLUDE THE CD THAT IS SUPOSED TO COME WITH IT, and get it for much cheaper in bulk. BUY FROM dornpub.com, AND GET THE CD!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,You Can Dance,"You Can Dance being Madonna's 1987 and her first remix album is a real gem with many fine treacks like the extended version of Into the Groove remixed by Sheep Pettibone , the remix of Spotlight by Jellybean and Everybody which was remixed by Bruce Forest and Frank Heller. The linernotes written by Bruce Chin are quite interesting and the booklet is quite spartan but serves its purpose with Madonna in some Spanish looking outfit. 4/5."
5,awesome music,"I owned a tape of this when I was younger, but it was ruined by so much play time. Now that I have it on cd, I can listen to it whenever and not have to worry. Thank you so much. I missed the song ""spotlight"". I have been playing it constantly since I received it."
3,HIT THE DANCEFLOOR!,"Once again Madonna proves to be a trendesetter.She released in 1987 this remixed compilation of her greatest hits until that time recruiting some of the hottest dance remixers and dj's of the period.The only unreleased track is the joyful, dance-oriented SPOTLIGHT.I strongly suggest its purchase to die-hard fans, disco bunnies and Herb Ritts followers, the pictures alone are worth the price of the cd...Get your (...) on the floor!"
3,Good dance mixes of your favorites.,"It this the best album ever, no. But great extended dance versions of your favorite early Madonna tunes. I think this album came out when remixes weren't in yet. Way ta' go Madonna for getting in early on the trend. The songs are good for dance parties and exercise."
2,You may not want to dance,"This is the first compilation of Madonna's work so it's fitting that it's remixes. The good: ""spotlight"" is a great, catchy song and this is the only place you can get it. ""into the groove"" still contains the winning elements of the orginal but with added layers. This version has become the accepted standard version. ""where's the party"" is amped up into a funky party anthem with more power than the orginal. The rest of the remixes are only average and for some mysterious reason we're given pointless dubbed versions of some of the songs already on this album instead of remixes of other songs. Madonna's success with remixes and on the billboard dance charts is legendary and unparalleled. Hopefully they will one day release a better cd to reflect this achievement."
4,Get Into the Groove,"OK old school fans, this one is GREAT! Probably one of Madonna's least celebrated CD's, You Can Dance, sums up the early days of her career with a handful of golden gems. Yes, its a bit dated but isn't everything from the 80's? Always a true innovator this was one of the first full length REMIX CD's--listen and you can really appreciate how the remix art form has evolved. The crown jewel of this collection is the now classic ""Get Into The Groove"" the mother of all Madonna songs! Here you get the 8:26 minute version, put it on and the 80's instantly come back. ""Step to the, Step to the, Step to the BEAT""!!"
5,"Fantastic, dance remix collection","Madonna's 1987 ""You Can Dance,"" album is a 10-track collection of some of her dance remixes, from all albums: 1983's ""Madonna,"" 1984's ""Like A Virgin,"" and 1986 ""True Blue."" Opening with a new song ""Spotlight,""(6:23), is an inspiring song, motivating everyone to get up and follow their dreams. Along with the great remixes of ""Everybody""(6:43), ""Physical Attraction""(6:20), and the motivational ""Over and Over""(7:11). Other great remixes and dub versions of ""Holiday""(6:32-dub version 6:56), ""Into the Groove""(8:26-dub version 6:23), and ""Where's the Party""(7:16-dub version 6:20). This would be great for parties, dancing, or just having a great time. Even if you can't dance, you'll still enjoy the music."
3,Its Pretty Fun,"Although, the album is now over 10 years old and these remixes are now a bit dated. They are still pretty fun to hear!! I think ""Into the Groove"" was the best remix. And ""Spotlight"" should've been a single. The only reason I gave this album 3-stars was because Im not a big fan of Remixes, but I am a huge fan of Madonna, and she can release anything and i wouldn't give it less than 3 stars!!"
3,80s Remix Album Doesn't Stand The Test Of Time,"For the 80s, this was an excellent remix cd. But now, this remix album doesn't hold up. Back then doing an extended version was considered a remix. But today, its considered being lazy. What Madonna needs to do is remix American Life and then re-released that. I am surprise that this cd is still available."
1,you can only dance,"I think this album is one of the ways Warner bros makes money out of us Customers. Though it has some great remix songsthis album is to dance, not to listen to, the only new song in here is Spotlight, which is very good (single only available in Japan), I wouldn't waste money on this one, I'llget the mp3 of SpolightI think if you have most Madonna album, you can create your own dance album cant you? shes got much better dance songs than those ones!"
3,I LIKE TWO MAY BE THREE TRACKS OFF OF THIS!!!,NOT A SHAME TO SAY IM A MADONA FAN!!!ACCORDING TO ME I STILL SAY SHE'S SEXY...IM STARTING TO GET BACK ON SOME VANILLA FLAVA!
3,Average Remix Album!,"This is Madonna's first remix album and IMO its her best one. It also includes the unreleased track ""Spotlight"", which I believe should of been a single. It would of put her in the Top 10 once again! I do like the Physical Attraction and Holiday Mixes. Those were mixes very well. I would recommend this album to you! This is actually the 2nd biggest selling remix album of all time(2nd to Michael Jackson's Blood On The Dance Floor remix album). It peaked at #11 on the Billboard 200 and has sold approx 5 million copies worldwide! Make sure you get your copy today!"
1,Buyers Beware!!,"All I Can say is being somewhat of a newbie to Amazon, that I made the mistake of buying a cassette tape instead of a cd. So just be careful to read everything very carefully before you buy.Aside from that, I am sure this is a great album of Madonna's. One of her classics, with La Isla Bonita and a number of other great songs. I look forward to buying the cd version so I can really get my groove on just the way Madonna intends."
4,Good Solid Dance,"This is a decent collection of remixes from Madonna's first two albums. There is one new song on here called Spotlight. It's not a bad song, but it doesn't sound like it was recorded specifically for this album. It sounds like a leftover track from her 1983 album that they decided to use on here. And for what it's worth, it sounds too much like Holiday to me. All the other remixes sound very solid, and keep an ear out for the remixes of Over and Over and Everybody (Madonna's first single). This usually turns up in cassette form in bargain bins, so pick it up if you find it."
3,For inspiration,"This is a Madonna ""remix"" album that was released in 1987. It features one ""new"" song, ""Spotlight"", but it sounds like a leftover song from her first album. It's a minor, but enjoyable, song. The rest of the songs were all previously released. Somewhat interestingly, most of the songs here are lesser known Madonna songs, like ""Physical Attraction"" and ""Over and Over"", instead of well known hits. Unfortunately, the remixes aren't all that interesting. They are mostly just longer, more dance oriented, versions of the original songs. There are also three ""dub versions"" of songs from earlier on the CD. In this case, ""dub version"" means ""version with most of the lyrics removed"". All in all, this is a decent Madonna album, but not an essential one."
3,CD great - case messed up,Great CD replacement from one I had in college. Was surprised to receive the CD and find the 'binding' of the case melted and a challenge to open w/o care. Luckily I had the original case from the CD that was damaged & just tossed the new 'melted' case. Music & CD played well!
5,BACK THEN AT YOU BEST MADONNA!,"MY DAUGHTER IS NOW THIRTY-TWO YEARS OLD AND THIS WAS HER FAVORITE OF MADONNA. THROUGH HER RELOCATING IN THE YEARS SHE LOST THIS CD. A VERY HARD CD TO FIND,ANYWHERE.THANK'S TO AMAZON .COM I FINALLY FOUND IT TO PURCHASE.I WILL DO MY SHOPING HERE FOR NOW ON."
2,You Can Dance,"If you already have her first three albums, there is no good reason to get this other than if you want the one new song, Spotlight. Spotlight is a fun ditty, but you can decide if you want to pay for all the other songs along with it. I thought that the extended dance remixes of her hit songs would be new and fresh, but really they are the same songs, just spread over six minutes. The one exception is the version of Over and Over, which does have a different sound. Any of the three previous albums is better than this."
3,Dance or DIE!!!,"This is a collection of mediocre remixes of some of Madonna's more mediocre dance songs. The only songs that were very good to begin with were Everybody and Over and Over. The others were alright, but they were less 'dance' songs, and more 'jump up and down in a giddy frenzy' songs. They should have included Burning Up, I Know It, Angel, Material Girl, Dress You Up, Stay, Pretender, Papa Don't Preach, and True Blue instead of the stuff on here.Also it is recorded in continuous sequence, so the only way to listen to this is straight through beginning to end. The only proper way to listen to it is at a party, and then you've just listened to Madonna for over an hour, and even the most die hard fans might call that a little much."
2,Good Movie-Bad DVD,Once again Olive films insults movie lovers and dvd buyers by this release. Extremely overpriced and without subtitles or sdh. What an outrage!!! Priced reasonably and with SDH or english subtitles I would buy-and I'm sure I'm not alone.
4,A must read,"Reminds me of the Twilight Zone, very interesting reading;fiction incorporated with history and medical theories with a surprise ending"
3,Quaint and quiet,"I did not get feeling of the time period as I read, but the imagery of a small town in Ohio was there. The action of the stories is quaint and quiet too."
3,Not up to par with expectations,"I thought I would really enjoy this classic since I grew up in small-town Ohio. I found it very difficult to stick with some of the stories, but muddled through. Some tales were decent but they would end too soon. It is an easy read and some may really enjoy it but I did not."
2,"Winesburg, Ohio","Winesburg, Ohio is a book full of unhappy people. Those who are married seem especially unhappy....the women are all tall and dark, the men are all ""thinkers"". Tho it won the Pulitzer, it was not a great book to read. Redeeming factor--makes OLIVE KITTEREDGE look really good--those stories are also about folks in a small town, also won Pulitzer, and I thought it a better read."
4,A patchwork of small-town American Midwestern life,"For someone who grew up in a small town (pop. 1000) in southern Indiana, I immediately drew a connection with Winesburg. Anderson's portrayal of the local residents leads people to believe that small town life can have the same problems as city life."
4,"Great flexibility, tilt mechanism a bit challenged","We purchased this mount for a Panasonic TC-20LA2 20"" flat panel LCD TV. It installed without a hitch and is clearly very well crafted. As it comes in the package it must be installed in a stud. It has two failry massive screws that are several inches long that would not ""bite"" wallboard and even plywood blocking.While it is very flexible with the swing arm, rotation and tilt adjustments we are finding the tilt mechanism a bit challenged by the Panasonic's 16 pound weight -- in spite of the 30 pound rated maximum of the bracket. Even when the tilt screw is tightened with a reasonable amount of force, you can cause the TV to drop further if you bump it lightly. It's not clear why this is occurring -- and its not an issue if you handle the TV carefully as you move it about -- but I would be skeptical that you could keep the tilt on a heavier TV if you used this bracket."
4,wallmount,"I am very happy about our new and inexpensiv wallmount. I would have liked it to have some kind of lock mechanism so that you could locked in a certain position, but other than that it works great."
3,tilt joint not built for use over 20 pounds,"to echo a few of the comments here, this arm is not really meant to handle ""up 30 pounds"" as it's specs claim. it's perfectly safe and the nickel bars are solid, but the flaw is the final joint (the tilt joint) that connects to the vesa mount plate. it is woefully inadequate supporting my 27 pound, 26"" w/ DVD sharp flatscreen. there was no way i could tighten the thumb knob sufficiently with my hand alone, and the display would just tilt all the way down, facing the floor. i had to go to home depot and pick up a special torque wrench to finally get it to settle, and i'm still not too confident with it.also, it did not come with the proper sized screws to attach the vesa mount on my display, leading to another purchase for the screws."
2,"Seems Like a Solid Mount, but the Tilt feature is useless","I purchased this unit and found it easy to mount and install (make sure you are screwing into something solid; the arm is fixed, so the TV will always be 6 inches away from the base). However, the tilt feature is useless and I couldn't get the screw to hold so the TV, a 26 inch Sharp HDTV, is tilted all the way so the bottom is against the wall.I will be returning this and getting a flat mount."
1,Deceiving,"The book tries to deceive the reader into convincing him it is fair, but at the same time it makes one side to be the side always to blame (Palestinians) while the other is just calm peaceful doves (Israel) who are just victims and did nothing wrong to anyone! From the progress of events since 1948, and the long history before that year, this is clearly not the case, and thus the book is completely biased and odd-handed (as compared to even-handed!)."
4,The truth is so nice to know.,The middle east has been a crazy episode in the world for so many years. It is difficult to understand why a piece of property smaller than almost every state in the US with less people then the 405 freeway at 4:00PM bothers so many Arabs. I do know for a fact that Israelis build hospitals and schools and Muslims blow them up. I do know if the Arabs would put down their weapons there would be PEACE and if the Israelis put down their weapons there would be a lot of Dead JEWS.This book explains what has happened. Please read this and find out the truth.
1,Horribly biased.,"This book is way too pro-Israel to make any attempt at historical honesty. There are other books out there which provide a much more accurate decription of the Middle East. Try Chomsky's ""Fateful Triangle"", for example, which, although dense, is much less biased than most anything else you'll find."
5,the Complete Idio'ts Guide to Middle East Conflict,"This is a very well written, informative and extensively researched book. It is a most worthwhile, accurate and extremely useful resource. A MUST Read for anyone interested in the Arab-Israeli conflict."
5,"Crisp, clear and concise",I have tried to understand this topic and found it to be very confusing. This was the first book that allowed me to understand the situation in the middle east without all the propaganda and emotion that is generally found in most of the literature.
4,at last-- clarity!,"What a service to the general public to at last have a clear picture of the Middle East conflict and the history that has fueled it. I don't need opinions. I will form my own. But I need the facts that will help me formulate my opinions intellectually. This guide, idiot's or not, provides that clarity. It is even-handed and precise.Thank you for stocking it and thank you for selling it."
1,"Revision that plagirises the work of Joan Peters, another hoax book author","This book's findings are pure fantasy and have been repudiated by the work of Norman Finkelstein. Bard's a biased author to start with AND claiming the Palestinians are not native to the land even though they speak a unique Southern Levantine dialect is patently absurd. Not recommended either for its simplicity or deliberate duplicity. Take a college course or use the web for comparative information. Otherwise, getting your info. from Bard will have left you as clueless about the region as before."
3,Uninformed but NOT a complete idiot!,"One would have to BE a complete idiot to believe this author's version of history! It's unfortunate that this book, which is obviously marketed toward those with little knowledge about the conflicts in the Middle East, was written with such a heavy bias. I may not know much about history, but I know when someone is trying to con me. Despite this I found the book to be very helpful in providing an easy to understand general outline of the sequence of historical events. It also had many interesting tidbits, such as Theodor Herzl's 1903 proposal that the Jewish home be made in Uganda instead of ""Palestine!"" If you are looking for a fair, well rounded view of specific events you'll have to find a different book."
1,embarrassing,"I've never written a review before on amazon, but this book has ired me enough to take the time to do so. I am a complete idiot on the subject of the middle east, knowing nothing about anything in terms of arab-israeli issues. so i *thought* this book would be a good place to start. My friend warned me to make sure the book isn't slanted one way or the other or i would be misinformed greatly. i thought, how could a ""dummies"" book be controversial???Well, I couldn't even make it 4 chapters in, without being disgusted at the complete bias the author displayed. I ended up asking my history major friend on a good non-biased book and he recommended me his university textbook...A Concise History of the Middle Eastby Arthur, Jr GoldschmidtI'm reading it now, and loving it."
3,good reference,It is a pretty good reference book. I have to take a class on the topic and it really help me to get the general idea.
3,Informative but disappointingly biased,"I expected an objective account. This book is clearly pro-Israel. Nevertheless, it gave a good account of the tortuous conflicts in the middle ease. I got the definite feeling, however, that I should go on to read an another account of same history to bring a better balance to the issues."
2,"Bard shows partiality, not objectivity...","I have been working with Palestinian Christians for five years now in their attempts to maintain dignity and a living wage in the face of the Israeli Occupation. This book does a disservice to their plight, painting a picture of pre-Israeli Palestine as a desolate, un-developed land and the Palestinians as unorganized southern Syrians with no sense of attachment to the land. Try telling this to the men and women who harvest olive trees that their ancestors planted 1,000 years ago. Read Munib Younan's book for a better firsthand account of what life is really like for the Arab peoples."
2,Unbiased??? NOT!,"Very informative book, providing background into the situation, but Bard is very biased (pro-Israeli). The book should be read with an open mind.I would like to see the Palestinian point of view represented in future editions."
1,Utter Rubbish!,"I would say that this book is unabashedly pro-Israeli, but in fact it repeats many worn myths that even Israeli historians have long since repudiated. The section on the Deyr Yassin massacre is truly pathetic. And the description of the events surrounding the downing of an Iranian civilian airbus by the USS Vincennes in 1988 is so completely inaccurate and totally contrary to the facts (as established by a joint Newsweek and Nightline investigation, a BBC investigation, and the ICAO investigation) that I literally thought this was a work of fiction. With Daniel Pipes as a consultant, what can you expect?"
1,Misleading,"The extremity of opinions presented evident here shows that the book was anything but unbiased. It was catered for one side, with little regard for historical facts or detached objectivity. It is within Dr. Bard's right to hold opinions and publish those. However, it is downright insincere to do it in the guise of an objective first-read for unsuspecting readers."
1,Very disappointing..,"I read this book to get some facts about the situation over there in order for me to make my own decision with respect to who is at fault for this conflict. Unfortunately, I got a very pro-Israeli account of the events that occurred and a feeling that the authors thought the Palestinians were sub-human. I am very disappointed in the ""Idiot's Guide"" publishers for saying that this book is an unbiased account of the Middle East conflict."
2,Disappointing,It would be wonderful to have a writer that can explain the conflict between the Palestinians and Israelis without being biased. Mitchell Bard is not one of them. This is a disturbing book to read when one actually has studied the topic. It's obvious that you favor one side and it's misleading to unsuspecting readers.
1,pure bias,"Trough out the book, I felt there was a strong bias favoring the Israelis. It almost convinced me that the arab people where violent sadistic people, while Israel had always done its best to help palestinians. Even when Israel had to force palestinians into leaving their homes, it was a necessary thing to do. Before buying this book, I strongly suggest for you to read the author's background. Its funny that they would choose a powerfull jewish activist instead of someone more neutral."
1,Misleading,"This is an extremely biased and misleading book. Arabs are portrayed as being belligerent and religiously barbaric, while the Israelis are shown to be innocently in search of peace and at all costs willing to compromise. The core issues that sparked the ongoing Middle East conflict in the early part of the 20th century are conveniently distorted; which reflect Dr. Bard's anti-Arab views."
1,"Some Facts, Too Much Bias","This is an excellent book if you want to get one side of the story of the Middle East conflict. It essentially lays out the rational Israeli side and makes a fairly convincing argument for the Israeli side of the argument. This is essentially the same argument and logic that is used by major US newspapers.However the guide purports to be a non-biased, factual look at the conflict and that is simply not the case. If you do buy this book, try another book from the Palestinian perspective as well to get ""the whole story"".The author does a good job of explaining one side of the story, but this is precisely the problem in America-- only one side of the story is known. By relying on mostly Zionist sources, the author robs his audience of a complete view of the conflict."
1,A Biased Opinion,"I read the book as an American trying to understand the motivations behind 9-11. I figured that a book on Middle Eastern Conflict would provide me with a broad summary. I soon realized that almost the entire book focused on Jewish history with Israeli/Arab conflict as a sub plot. Bard's account of this history is very one-sided. I am no historian, however, any ""complete idiot"" can see in this conflict there are no innocent sides as Bard portrays."
1,Pure Propaganda,"I was excited to find an easy to read and comprehensive text on the complicated problems of the Middle East but was soon discouraged. I honestly began the book with neutral feelings about the conflict. However the book is so blatantly biased toward the Isreali point of view it destroys the credibility of the author and ""Idiot"" books in general. It could have been authored by the Isreali government as far as I could tell. My copy is being returned to the publisher. It was that bad!"
1,Very Disappointed,"I figured that with all the books out there on comparative history, that the Complete Idiot's Guide would at least provide an objective look at this centuries old conflict. The first couple of chapters were somewhat informative (in a very basic kind of way) on the histories of Islam, Judaism and Christianity. Unfortunately, that is where the objectivity died.This book is an excellent source on the history of the conflict from the Jewish perspective. I blame myself for not reviewing the author's biography before purchasing it. The bias can easily be found there.I hold no partiality for any of the three religions discussed in the book. I simply wanted an unbiased summary of the conflict. You will not find that in this book. It took everything I had to simply finish the book."
4,An excellent analysis on a difficult topic,"I was expecting a lightweight book with humoristic content, instead I found a surprisingly well documented, well written book which presents a very fair picture of the Middle East crisis.I definitely recommend it to anyone who wishes to learn more about this situation."
5,Impressive scope and content,"After reading this book and the reviews here, I can see why some readers are particularly upset. ""Idiot's Guide"" continues the debunking (as in many other books) of some of Israel's adversaries' most cherished myths that continue to be used to foment enmity in that volatile region of the world. For example, the so-called ""massacre"" at Deir Yassin and the bombing of the King David Hotel by the Irgun are two events that have been so distorted by Arabs that they have become fables. Also, the history of Jerusalem from ancient times to the present, as depicted in this book, is precise and true. A great read."
3,Percolating keyboards.,"This hits package contains a good collection of songs from Depeche Mode. It covers their first few albums. All thirteen of the tunes are in a synth-pop musical direction. I respect their musicianship and songwriting skills. The keyboard playing is enjoyable, and the singer also does a nice and effective job with the vocal duties. I've had this album for a few years--it's cool to listen to from time to time. My favorite track of the collection is ""Shake the Disease."" I also like the intro to ""Love in Itself."" I find the intro to be both sprightly and infectious. All of the tunes are listenable and satisfying. The CD booklet contains a short biography of the band and several photographs, too. Worth a listen."
4,NOT a 'Best of' set.,"It's a good thing Vince Clarke left Depeche Mode when he did, because it's unlikely Erasure or indeed Depeche Mode itself would still be around today.The first half of this recording is passable, but they sound like they're trapped in a style of music they're not really suited for. Out of the first five tracks, only 'New Life' and 'Meaning of Love are even worth a listen.The rest of the album shows Depeche Mode were heading in the right direction. Between losing the light pop tunes and David Gahan finding his voice (probably as a result), they finally achieve their style of music. With that said, 'Shake the Disease', 'It's Called A Heart', and 'Fly on the Windscreen' are the best songs here.Having heard only this album and 'Violator', and preferring the latter, I would have to suggest starting with either 'Some Great Reward' or 'Black Celebration'(which is what I'll be buying next) as 'Catching Up..."" only serves to show that the best of Depeche Mode was yet to come."
1,UNCOOL,Depeche Modes early work sounds dated and uncool now days. And at times embarrassing to listen to. I became a big fan of Depeche Mode after hearing the song Policy of Truth off the Violator ablum which is Depeche Mode's true Masterpiece next to Music for the Masses. Everything Depeche Mode did after 1985-86 is absolutlely amazing to listen to. I recommend Violator or Music for the Masses instead.
5,It's a lot like life!,"I first remember getting this tape when I was seven and thinking,""Are these the guys from Jem and the Holograms?"" Well, their style has certainly evolved from the almost campy ""New Life"" and ""Dreaming of Me"", but nothing they have ever done (or will ever do) can spoil the initial ecstacy one feels when hearing these little brilliant moments of pop genius. (however, I still think Black Celebration is the best album in the history of recorded music...I'm just weird like that)"
5,It's all here,A great collection of early DM hits before they hit the mainstream. A must have for new fans who think they only have 3 albums.
1,not the one you should get,"Depeche Mode is a really great band, but Catching Up with Depeche Mode is not the greatest hits collection to get if you want to hear the best from their early career. The band released Singles 81-85 a few years back with is more complete with such great sogns as People are People. It also has some great remixes to it."
2,DM before success.,"Yeah, there are a few hits (""Master and Servant""), but I am a fan of the ""Music for the Masses"" and ""Violator"". This album is good for a DM Collection, but no more than that."
2,How you'd better not remember them,"In short: good songs on this compilation are 'Blasphemous rumours', 'Somebody', 'Fly on the windscreen'. Listenable are: 'Shake the disease' and 'Love in itself'. Rest: bin stuff !"
5,Adria is Real,"Chef DL's review of Adria's cuisine is unfortunately all too familiar. It's sad that a lot of chefs from the 'old school' find molecular gastronomy to be a cold science far removed from the art of food. That opinion, however, is the equivalent of cavemen arguing that clarifying a stock to make consomme is not real food.Chef DL... just look around at all of the chefs using foams and gelees around the world... sure, it isn't all done well, but at least most people aren't afraid or intimidated to try. It's only a matter of time before chefs everywhere start experimenting with spherification as well.Zilla"
3,Analyzing Complexities of Human Relationship,"If you like Balzac and other European books of the era, you will probably like this one too. It deals with human relationships, especially love and desire, and how feelings get transformed from one form into another.Allan, a young man adopted by his mother's friend, is in love with the woman who adopted him. He also has a relationship with her daughter. The long, convoluted discussions of feelings become a daunting read at times and Oscar Wilde's translation does not help. But overall, it is a compelling novel. The author keeps you turn pages with unexpected twists and turns.I also found the exploration of human desire between the same and different genders and people of different ages unexpectedly open for the time in which the book was written. I am not sure that I agree with d'Aurevilly conclusions, but they have made me think."
5,What a wonderful artist!,I had the pleasure of working with him. He is so committed to doinghis best and this album had many wonderful songs on it. It'seasy to give it 5 stars. Was particularly impressed with SAUVEZMOI. Hallyday is like non other. A treasure. And...a great actor.Am assuming that he has re-issued this great album on CD.DaWentz
4,"Good, but not their best.","These guys don't put out bad albums. Strategem is very solid and I still enjoy listening to it, but it's not them at their best. I found it less inspired than their other albums.If you're a fan and have all the rest, certainly buy this one too. But if you're considering buying a BHTM album for the first time, pick another one. Their other albums are fantastic, while this one is just good."
4,actual songs!,Guitar oriented without being overpowering.The singer's voice gets to me after awhile.
5,Great Halter,"This halter is wonderful! The color is bright, halter is thick, sturdy and durable. Easy to adjust the nose band and the clip makes it easy to put on the horse and take off."
2,Too Big!,"We have a baby (3 year old) shire who keeps breaking out of his halters, and any replacements we find are all too small... I was pleasantly surprised that this piece was too big for our little guy - we made a new hole for the buckle under the chin, and have no complaints. Even though the description says 1100+ pounds, it'll fit your 1600+ Draft with no problems. :)Edit: He snapped this thing like a thread when we really needed it to stand up to his wiles. Sorry, had to remove a few stars."
2,no answers,"These problems look good, but without an answer key they're pretty useless. My algebra isn't bad, considering, but I had it 30 years ago, and so it's really not a useful tool for my daughter to review."
1,"Unless you are an algebra whiz, this is useless","I bought this for my daughter to keep on her skills over the summer, but there is no answer key nor is one available anywhere. It's been many years since I've worked algebra problems so there is no way to check if she's solved the problems correctly. This was a waste of money!"
1,Free,This packets are free to download from the glencoe website. I say this because I know how little teachers are paid and any teaching resources that are free to the public should be shared with all teachers for free.
3,Not enough answers,"Would help if the answers were provided, as well as step by step instructions on how to do each problem. That's always a plus."
4,Good OEM replacement,"Took a pair of these to the mechanic and had them put on. It's been a good replacement and has lasted 3 years: snow, heat, everything."
3,Not really a horror movie,"I would give this movie 3-1/2 stars. I appreciate what the directors were trying to do and they are very successful in creating the world of ""Jack the Ripper"". This movie doesn't provide any real scary moments however. The movie isn't about things that go bump in the night, it's about the investigation of the murders. Johnny Depp does a good job with what he's given, Heather Graham at least looks good. She looks too good in fact. The rest of her friends look like crap compared to her. It doesn't make a whole lot of sense.Interesting theory on the Ripper murders. I guess it's as good as any. The extras are fun and interesting. Average replay value. It's a good movie, the ending seems a bit tacked on, but nonetheless, it's worth a look."
3,To Jeff the Fat Kid,"To Jeff below: A very good review. However, you made an error in your historical facts. The potato famine of Ireland was in the 1840's"
5,A movie for the smart audience,"I just read a review where somebody didn't like that this movie wasn't fast paced. Well that is exactly what I liked about the movie. It was smart. sophisticated and creepy. It reminded me allot of ""The Others"" with Nicole Kidman.This isn't your typical Hollywood movie and that is everything that I love about it. Both brilliant, underrated film from the past year."
2,Vastly Disappointing,"The only reason I gave this movie 2 stars is that the settings, costumes and atmosphere do a great job of evoking London at the time of Jack the Ripper. However, I found it unnecessary and disrespectful to the memory of Abberline to have him portrayed as a druggy and a ""psychic"". The facts are interesting enough; why this embellishment? To appeal to today's audience who seem to relish uncontrolled substances? It is my feeling that most serious Ripper fans would not only be disappointed in this film, but also find it a very poor depiction of everyone involved, including the prostitutes. They are much too ""pretty"" in this film. Filmakers seem adverse to portraying these poor, unfortunate ladies of the evening as the sorry alcoholic, sometimes toothless and very ill women that they were. But I guess audiences are more attracted to pretty faces then to reality."
2,Buy the Alan Moore original,"As a fan of both Alan Moore and Jonny Depp, I was looking forward to this movie. Ultimately most other reviewers are right -- great detail, not much feel. It's not the worse movie ever, but rent it, don't buy it. If you want a work of creative genius, buy the graphic novel by Alan Moore. Don't be turned off if you aren't a comic book fan, the writting is teriffic, and the whole thing is very intelligent."
2,Aptly named,"Visually loud, poorly constructed story that avoids making sense at every turn. You'll see pointless references to the elephant man and watch as the ripper's eyes take on a huge, dilated effect as the evil overcomes him. It is really an assinine, immature effort and a wonder that this made it out of editing in this state of hackneyed disconnect."
3,3 1/2 It's Bloody Good Time,"Just a few points that have already been reiterated throughout most of these reviews.1)Beautiful Cinematography2)Johnny Depp. It may appear to be the same role he did in Sleepy Hallow BUT the man can act.3)Great DirectorsNow I was surprised at what a complete gore fest this movie was. It's so maniacly fun, more of a slasher pic then a thriller. I took me completely by surprise at how far they went with this pic, at times bordering on NC17 type gore. Great stuff. Definetly check it out. And the mystery of who Jack was will get you through between the killings.A Bloody Good film."
1,Pure Blech,"This movie was so dissappointing. The whole movie annoyed me, but the most annoying part was the stupid background music that played all through the film. And it got louder and louder and louder! The ""Ripper"" theory was [weak] and I agree with other posters--BORING. Heather Graham's clipped British accent fails when all the other prostitutes have a cockney accent. Don't waste your money on this one."
3,Love Johnny Depp,"For me, Johnny Depp can't do a ""bad"" movie, although this was a little boring at times. It was a different take on the story that we all know! The setting is good, but the story could have had more interest! As usual, Johnny Depp was good!"
3,THIS IS NOT THE TRUE STORY OF JACK THE RIPPER,"Wihout Jhonny DEPP this movie is not enought good for attract my watchfulness ! The horror is beside the possible and the conspiracy don't ""take the road"" with a man who is forced to take differents drugs ! I've not so like this movie and i note 12/20 not bad no good .......between, ...what ."
2,From Hell Watching This Movie,"Depp is miscast as a shy, dim witted, idiot savant English detective who snorts opium by the wagon loads in this ""Hollywoodization"" of the Jack Ripper scenario. He attempts to keep an English accent but doesn't realize he sounds nowhere near that tonality. The movie, for the most part, is quite boring and doesn't offer anything significant except loud music, gory MTV style editing and too many whores in the streets of London to look at. What we have here is an experienced director (the Huges brothers) who do not even know where to begin with the premise that Ripper was actually some looney from the moors district in this mess. Not recommended for intelligent viewers."
2,Torturous,"While this film looks really nice and the camerawork is relatively impressive, it is finally a failure in filmmaking. By no fault of either the Hughes Brothers or Johnny Depp - the only mystery here is how such a talented group of people made a film like this. It isn't enough that the Jack the Ripper story has already been done in so many ways that it has ceased to be interesting, but here the identity of the ripper is telegraphed to the audience at such an early point in the film that it is laughable - like a Scooby Doo cartoon almost. Additionally, it's difficult to suspend disbelief at times - espescially when confronted with Heather Graham's rosy cheeked and milky complected prostitute - who shows her connection to the grotty and filthy streets she inhabits by her perfect straight white teeth and a smudge of dirt on her face. Ultimately a failure, but perhaps worth a rental."
4,Johnny Depp,"As usual, a riveting performance fromone of my favorites. Highly recommended for Depp fans."
4,"Very Good, Stylish but Not Great","This film just misses being a classic. The effects are fabulous so if effects were all, it would have made it. And Johnny Depp does his usual first class acting job. Some are complaining that his accent wasn't authentic but I could hear and understand every word he said which I probably couldn't have if he'd used a genuine Cockney accent. I think the factor that causes this film to just miss classic status is that the villain is just too far over the top. This weird thing they do to his eyes, for one, is way too offputting. I imagine special lenses were inserted into his eyes for this effect. It is the one effect I could have done without. This is the story of a detective (Depp) on the trail of Jack the Ripper as he murders prostitutes in Victorian England with Jack being the villain of the piece. Heather Graham does a nice job playing one of the prostitutes."
4,An entertaining movie based on Stephen Knights/Martin shorts perspective,"This movie was fun to watch and Johnny Depp was great as he mostly always is.As far as factual accuracy is concerned...NO..This movie seems to be based on Stephen Knight's and Martin Short's books about freemasonry...In counter to those books I would recommendJohn Robinson's ""a pilgrims path""and/orJasper Ridley's ""the freemasons""those are books and this is a movie...The MOVIE is fun...the books its based on may be fundamentalist christian propaganda...Did Johnny Depp know this.....?"
5,"Good movie, okay ending","Good movie, but I think it should have had a better ending but I guess they wanted to make it more to what really happened in real life. Even will the ending I enjoy it.. it was good!"
5,Very nice tranlation of the Ripper lore,"The movie has a laconic, dreamy feeling, and is pretty intoxicating. The movie isn't as scary as it could probaly be, but there are many ghastly, gruesome moments that hadthe audience flinching. I recommend it highly, especially on the big screen when all the beautiful cinematography and direction show through."
2,beautiful failure,"Johnny Depp should never do a movie that is not directed by Tim Rice. He's a terrific actor but he just doesn't cut it as a opium smoking Inspector Frederick Abberline. He's too young and frankly, if Abberline was this weird he wouldn't have lasted on the force. Heather Graham is completely out of her depth. She looks wrong for the part, (How many street walkers look this healthy and pretty?) can't do the accent and can't act. Compare this to the Michael Caine version and you'll see how weak the Hughes Brothers' effor was."
3,Class B film,"As I am a fan of Johnny, I cannot say this is a great film. Stories of ""Jack The Ripper"" were counted as 1000s, and this is surly not the best.Johnny, though had a great performance, yet cannot act as a Dark-agent, as the story would like to tell.Heather Graham, could not become a reperesntation of virgin as the story would like to tell.and finally, Ian Holm, was not suitable for the role, ""Sir William Gull"" during his age and body (thought he acts great as the normal Gull, but not good in being Jack)Scenes in the film are suck, make me NOT feeling story is happening in Lardon, but a STUDIO!.In another words, this may be better if director worked better and got a more suitable cast."
2,"Slow, it goes nowhere.","From Hell starring Johnny Depp is set against the backdrop of the famed killer, Jack the Ripper. Depp is a great actor but even his unique talent can't save this boring, slow-moving train wreck. Who cast Heather Graham?! She is one of the worst female actors ever!! She can't even pull off any kind of accent, her performance is painful to watch. This film tries to be scary and grounbreaking but I lost interest halfway through, snooze..."
5,My nickname is Jack The Ripper. I have been..........,"studying and researching Jack The Ripper since I received the nickname by my 6th grade teacher. She named me that because I used to knock people out. Not like Jack did, but I did it with my fists. I used to be a bully.But since then I have found Jack to be quite astonishing. Heather Graham is one hot cookie."
2,From Hell,"From Hell was weird, Dumb, gross, sickening and hard to watch! The Hughes Brothers are the weirdest people! I thought that it was the dumbest movie EVER since the movie The Blair Witch Project!... From Hell was way to sickening for me to sit down and watch! It also had way- way to much... content in it! And why was John Merrick(The Elephant Man) in that movie? It was just plain gross and dumb and so are the directors!... I gave it a 2 stars because It was a tad bit interesting! But I hated it!"
4,Tense and richly thematic.,"We went to see ""From Hell"" yesterday, and it is chilling, lovely, and full of suspense. I didn't know what to expect from the Hughes Brothers with this genre - it's very well done. It's graphic, but not grotesque. It gives you glimpses into every dark corner of the Victorian age. Johnny Depp is very good, and his character manages to be both tragic and brilliant. If you haven't read the graphic novel, hold off until you've seen it - they do a wonderful job of dropping clues you don't put together until just the right moment.Highly recommended."
4,"Well Done Art, Okay Story Line","Scenery is done very well great costumes, setting and cast. And while I relise the story line was not the directors, I belive they should have kept 'Jack the Ripper's' identity unshown as the real case was instead of going on one of the main theories. I liked the personal touch of the story with Johnny Depp and Heather Graham falling in love even though she is going to die. That brings up another point, the French girl that dies in the end and Mary Kelly going to Ireland, as much as you want that to be the truth, the directors should have stuck with the true events, I do relise though that without changing things up to create human interest it would be nothing more than a murder diary on film. I did like this movie a lot in the art sense, and it is worth the buy.And someone in a previous review talked about his absinth it is not poison is it opium he pours over the suger cube then lighting it causes it to carmelise and mix with the drink."
5,Friendship,"I left this film most impressed with its portrayal of friendship and loyalty. Yes, through all the gruesome Ripper stuff and the depiction of grimy Whitechapel, I was struck with how the sergeant was there for the inspector and how the inspector would never betray his beloved Mary. It seems to me that this theme of loyalty is a common one in Depp's films, and he is a master at capturing its essence.It does occur to me after watching this: Isn't it about time to bury this Ripper story? Why not replace it with the gory legend of the couch potato who flew into a rage when his remote went dead: Jack the Flipper."
3,This is a good or a bad film?,"If you don`t know anything about the history of Jack The Ripper is a good film, but if you know is a bad film. Jack The Ripper it`s a true story not a fiction like this."
2,Average,"this Film didn't do much for me at all.I respect the Hughes Brothers&Johnny Depp is a Cool Actor,but this Film was to CLiched driven&tried to be Modern but it was hit&alot of Miss for me overall."
2,this is a bad movie,"Johnny Depp plays Frank Abberline as a greasy drug addict. Heather Graham plays Mary Kelly as a beautiful, healthy and charming street hooker. This alone should tell you that the Hughes brothers aren't even trying to make a remotely accurate film. The ending is partially a rip off of of the superior Michael Caine movie and partially an idiot's fantasy. I'd have to say this is the worst Ripper film I've ever seen."
1,where's Mulder...Scully,"The Jack the Ripper murders as an elaborate Free Mason conspiracy. Need I say more? A total waste of Johnny Depp's talent and time. I think he played the same character in Sleepy Hollow, didn't he? The old guy from The Fifth Element does a nice job as the compassionate doctor."
2,ALL of this edition DEFECTIVE!,"Rotten or NO QUALITY CONTROL - 4 out of 4 sets that I've tried have defective menus - They are so messed up and unwatchable that in some cases the bonus material cannot be activated - Thus making this 2 disc edition utterly useless! The film portion on the first disc plays normally (its menus are also unwatchable.The film itself is very good - A clever ""twist"" on the Ripper murders - and Depp, as usual is terrific, always fascinating and demanding more of himself."
4,A Johnny Depp Film Worth Seeing,"Heavy on atmosphere and even heavier on conspiracy theories, FROM HELL boasts outstanding performances from Johnny Depp and Heather Graham as two lost souls crying out for one another's company while remaining caught in the twists and turns of Jack the Ripper's nefarious deeds toward the end of the 1900s. A fascinatingly brisk tale, not for the squeamish of heart or stomach, but one that dares to draw its one conclusions when other pictures have failed to do so. Sit back, have some popcorn, and enjoy the suspense."
3,Victom of too many theories,"The mystery of who the Jack the Ripper was, assuming he still isn't around, is what has lead me to watch several documentaries and read several books all trying to solve the mystery. By the end of the dvd, my thought was, 'Disappointing'. There's some romance, which led me to think, 'Why is that there?'. The movie could have been about a fictionary serial killer. There are extra features, and a mini-documentary about the facts known and supposed I enjoyed much more than the movie. A movie that's not bad, just not great considering all the material available."
4,A Good Flick,"My husband and I got this for ""date night"", I really fround it interesting. It was a fun movie of fiction BASED on fact. It is actually just one possible scenario of what or who was the responsible serial killer in 19th century London. I do appreciate the fact that they did not make ths film as gruesome as they could have. I did some research after watching and was chilled at seeing some pictures of the actual places and how closely they got them to look the same.It was a worthwhile movie!"
4,Atmoshperic Thriller,New twist on the Ripper genre with foxy Heather Graham scores with its 1888 Whitechapel atmoshpere. Johnny Depp gives a bravura performance as the Ripper systematically or should I say ritually kills ladies of the evening. This one is not for the squeamish or light-hearted. Intense photography coupled with excellent musical soundtrack evokes some chilling moments that electrify the screen with sinister and provacitive imagery.
4,All in their own hell,"The performances of Ian Holm and Johnny Depp really make this a movie worth watching, as does all the attention to detail in recreating 1888 London.The story moved along quickly and was very suspenseful, exploring all the little hells of the main characters. This tied together the story nicely, as did the motive behind it all.A very interesting take on an infamous bit of history."
1,TOTAL ...,"The ""Hughes Brothers"" are absolute no talent hacks. What an amazing leap from films ghetto and ""gangstas"" to the tast of bringing their view of London to the screen. Aside from this film being superficial and down right boring, (with American actors playing UK) do view the Hughes Brothers flippancy in the documentaries, as they stroll down the lane where they joke about John Merrik (the elephant man) being the killer with his withered hand, or the fake bodies strewn across the sets. I wouldn't have been so appalled by this...if his film hadn't been as witless, pointless and thoroughly demeaning as it was. The best I can say about the ""creative geniuses"" is their DP did a good job.Concerning the rest of the film, Johnny Depp puts in his typical bland performance, Heather Graham attempts an Irish/UK accent, and HOW BLOODY OBVIOUSLY CAN THE KILLER BE IN THIS VERSION! I could tell from the trailer!..."
1,The worse kind of exploitation of a tragig story.,"I hated this film, had it set out to try and give an honest appraisal of the murders, not the gory nature of them, but the sadness and tradegy of the lives and deaths of these woman; I may have given it a better rating. It doesn't, it does what most films on the story do, which is to add in barmy and bizarre conspiracy theory for the sake of sensation and to make the terror and horror a entertainment factor.The story is not entertainment, it's the worse kind of tragic conclusion to wasted and abused lives and that should be the message of any film exploring it's continued mesmer.The victims are as much abused by this kind of inhuman exploitation as they were when they lived."
