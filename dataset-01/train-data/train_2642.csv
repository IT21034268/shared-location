1,WARNING! THIS DVD IS FULL SCREEN !!!!!,"Who would want to see Picnic in any other format than WIDESCREEN!!!This movie has not been available in a widescreen edition from Amazon for a LONG TIME......so when I saw they were now selling it I ordered it right away, just assuming it was widescreen. JUST A REMINDER TO CHK FURTHER DOWN THE PAGE AND READ ALL THE INFO!Hopefully they will accept the return and I'll go on waiting for it to be sold again in the widescreen format."
1,"5 stars for the film, 1 for this DVD release","I've waited for years to get this wonderful classic on DVD and was so disappointed to discover it's only available in a full-screen format. For those who don't know the difference, this classic was originally filmed in a widescreen format, so to make it fit the traditional square television, they had to crop out a lot of the picture. What's more, this ""restored"" version contains no documentaries--only trailers and cast lists. I e-mailed Sony about a possible widescreen release and was told there are no plans for another release at this time. What a shame! The film was released on VHS in a widescreen format and deserved to be handled with the same respect in the DVD release. If you want to get the full impact of the theatrical release, don't buy this chopped-up version. Save your money and watch the VHS or widescreen airings on Turner Classic Movies. Eventually someone will do right by this film and release a better DVD."
1,Picnic--DVD Not Letterboxed--Don't Bother!,"Picnic, based on a play by William Inge, directed by Joshus Logan, Starring William Holden, Kim Novak, Cliff Robertson, Susan Strassberg among ohters offers blistering adult drama and great music score by George Duning. WARNING TO ANYONE BUYING THIS DISC: According to Amazon, this disc is incorrectly formatted at a 1.33:1 aspect ratio. The movie was shot in the very wide anomorphic CinemaScope process at 2.35:1. If you buy this disc,you are losing about 45% of ther original image. If you like to view your movies as close to the original format as possible, DO NOT BUY THIS DISC!"
2,DVD video quality disappointing,"The movie itself is classic entertainment, and my wife and I have enjoyed our VHS tape of it (in ""letterbox"" format) many times. However, our recent purchase of the DVD was a disappointment due to (1) the ""pan and scan"" format and (2) the poor color quality characterized by a brownish tinge throughout much of the movie, making it look ""old"".Until a restored version is available on DVD, I recommend avoiding the DVD and settling for the VHS tape. The sharpness of the DVD may be a little better than the tape, but the letterbox and color tones of the tape far outweigh the surprisingly marginal quality of the DVD. Such a great motion picture deserves a better DVD."
1,Picture Quality Awful,"Beware of this 'Restored Print'. Picture quality of this print is terrible and impossible to watch on a high definition display. Furthermore, even though the film was done in widescreen format this is only full-screen. Why would a restored print in this day an age have a full-screen format?"
5,"Yes, yes ... please re-release this movie!","I add my voice to the chorus of those who would like to be able to purchase this wonderful movie. Anybody thought of writing to the movie studio that made it?Like many others, I first saw it as a teenager and was moved by the dance scene. (At my wedding, the first song my wife and I danced to was the theme from ""Picnic"").Rosalind Russell's diatribe after the dance (""the gutter's where you came from and the gutter's where you belong"") is also priceless.And for the person further down in the reviews who wanted to know the name of the festival Kim Novak was queen of, it was Neewollah (Halloween backwards)."
3,A PICNIC IN THE COUNTRY,"OK version of the William Inge Broadway play casts thirtysomething William Holden in the twentysomething role of Hal, a drifter who blows into a sleepy Kansas town on a Labor Day Holiday weekend. How does the movie shake up the sameness of the one set play? It goes on a picnic, literally showing what the play only eluded to, with an entire town celebrating an Americana holiday weekend, with much sly eavesdropping on the American conciousness. Picture Steven Spielberg's work with New England townies in ""Jaws"", and Director Joshua Logan accomplisshes much of the same with Mid-Westerners in a down home country state of being. I also liked the visual sky and corn stalks references of the farming industry governing, like a sleeping watchdog, over the rural community. The best thing about it though, and the best performance comes from the featured screen debut of Cliff Robertson who brings much spirit and sensitivity to the role of the lead character's best buddy."
2,This film blows.,"I will admit that this film does a good job of depicting a painfully provincial midwestern town in the 50's -- with everyone busy being violently swell. But it fails to really take flight. The music has horrible melodramatic spikes, the story suffers with implausable character development, and is frankly painful to watch. It is really a pity this film took time from Mr. Holden's life; that he could have used making a better picture. If you must see it, see it on a rental basis. Baby."
1,must be 2 versions...mine is FULL SCREEN ONLY GARBAGE....,some folks report having a double sided version of this with full screen pan and scan (cinematography abortion) on one and the full gorgeous cinemascope version on the other....well the version I just received is FULL SCREEN only...and one sided...of course its insult to injury that the program starts 2:35 widescreen while they run the credits (don't want to cut those folks names off) but as soon as the directors name runs..BAM..full screen ...and its horrible...grainy garbage.James Wong Howe...the adored cinematographer who filmed this obviousl composed for the full wide screen as the pan and scan is worse than normal with way too much information missing.honestly...when will the studios learn? I guess they figure only elderly ladies like my mother ..who still have a burning hotteee for William Holden will want this and they are tired of explaining the BLACK BARS to them? for the rest of us...ARGGGGGGHHHH
3,"Beware, this is full-screen junk, not wide-screen.","This arrived today, Oct 12th, 2007. I was excited to own a copy of one of my favorite movies, and popped it into the DVD player right away.What a HUGE disappointment. First you get the ""formatted for this screen"" disclaimer, then you see the Columbia logo and the titles in wide-screen (as this SHOULD be), then it's pan-n-scan full screen garbage! This movie took full avantage of the wide screen, and this DVD ruins that.Amazon, fix the description of this movie. It's NOT in the original aspect ratio. Buyers... skip this until Columbia does this the right way."
1,What's the Point of Watching Part of a Movie???,"I purchased this, noting the word ""restored"" prominently displayed on the package. However, it is not is widescreen, so you are not even seeing what the film maker originally intended. The print wasn't that great either. Why do they sell products like this? I guess it's because people like me buy them, and don't pay enough attention to the description. Looked into returning it, but amazon would only refund half of the price. With me paying the postage, I would have lost money on the deal. Anyone want it?"
1,What happened to LETTERBOX format?,"I love ""Picnic"" starring Kim Novak and William Holden but...the movie was not in letterbox format!! The entire movie with the exception of the very beginning and the very end of the movie was in WIDESCREEN format. You could not get the full effect of this timeless love story of a drifter who changed the lives of many in a 24-hour period. I recommend that this movie be put in letterbox format ONLY and burn the widescreen versions of this timeless classic forever."
2,Widescreen now available,"Both Borders and Barnes and Noble now carry a widescreen version of Picnic:http://video.barnesandnoble.com/DVD/Picnic/William-Holden/e/043396828797/?itm=4Widescreen on one side, fullscreen on the other. It says ""Columbia Classics"" across the top of the package.I wish Amazon would carry this version, as I don't want to open a new account at one of those other places just for one item."
5,Picnic,Brought back many pleasant memories to my wife and I from our high school days. This has always been a favorite movie of ours.
1,vhs picnic,"video was poor quality and it stated it was letter size. Letter size was unacceptable too narrow, cut out beauty of film."
3,Hard movie to find in DVD,"When I couldn't find ""Picnic"" locally, I turned to AMAZAON. My order arrived promptly - however when we popped it in the DVD player excitedly, there were weird subtitles. Also, the quality of color could be better. It wasn't until after we watched the entire movie that we discovered it was pre-set with subtitles in Korean. The second time I watched it alone, I had to reset the monitor to ""English with no subtitles."" There should have been an accompanying note of explanation."
2,Very dated but definitely widescreen,"Just saw this movie for the first time ever, very strange, just never been very interestd in it, but glad I saw it for the beauty that was Kim Novak (the only cast member who is still alive)> But the film is so so dated, Rosalind Russell's performance is so over wrought, stagey, ridiculous. She seemed to improve as a film actor in the last 15 years of her career, she was not at her best here. Using film acting technique more acceptable in the thirties. William Holden is so so miscast, twenty years too old for the role. A wonderful actor nonetheless, but it spoils the whole film that he is so old for the role that should be played by someone about 25 to 30. Incidentally, the print I have is in widescreen , bought in Australia, but seems to be the international print. I am guessing the version now available worldwide would be widescreen which is used so well."
5,Picnic :,"Get your hands on a copy of this video! If you like William Holden and Kim Novack, you will love their chemistry in this movie. Picnic is a masterpiece of sensuality and characterizations. Just sit back and go to this picnic on Labor Day in a town with people you will never forget."
3,Who shrunk this wide-screen pic???,"I have always been a big fan of this movie, and, like many others, the dance sequence between the two stars is marvelous. BUT, when you watch the movie on a flat screen (plasma) TV, it borders on a waste of time. The aspect ratio of the opening scenes is full scale (2.55), but when the movie gets going, all you get is 1.33. My VHS version does the whole thing in letterbox, a MUCH better format. But with this CD, even the opening scenes at 2.55 are 'scrunched down' on BOTH the top and bottom of the screen, making the picture really small. I pitched my CD out. Waiting for the wide-screen version that flat screen TVs were made for!"
2,I was looking for sizzle & got fizzle,Good story line but I normally buy an Intimate Moments title for the sensuality -- in that area this one was really a dud.
3,Not as good as I was hoping,"I own a lot of new-age music and was hoping for a richer sounding CD than this. It's not awful, but I'm not real happy with it."
3,Sounded rushed,"Of course, it cannot be expected that String Quartet organizers actually appreciate the various artists they make ""tributes"" to. Its more a marketing effort or a novel approach. In any event, the DM tribute falls a little flat. There are moments of achievement, but generally the artists seem to miss the emotions and subtleties of DM.I bought it and spun it a few times. You may want to pass."
3,Disappointed,"It disappoints, as it is not the type of chamber music or authentic instruments that would have been played at a Regency Period party. I did not felt it puts one in a Jane Austen mood. It's just another CD of classical music that does not move me in particular."
2,Wobbly & Cracked!,"Craftsmanship is shotty--the base of the rack was crooked, as well as several other pieces (ornamental and bottom stabilizing rack). The main pieces were bent and one leg is 3/4 of an inch shorter than the other. I'm disappointed with the quality of this blanket rack, and hope that other customers are well aware of the lack of ""American craftmanship"" of this overly expensive and underwhelming piece. Very, very disappointing!!!"
4,One of thoses Page-Turners; Don't Start It Late At Night!,"Great protagonist and characters. One of the best psychological thrillers I've read in a long time. Fluid, literate writing. Deliciously chilling. Can't wait to look for more books by this author."
3,Hmm..,"Blazin' Hip Hop & R &B wasn't that bad. I wouldn't say I liked all the songs but the majority of them were good. This isn't one of the CDs that will get you hooked but deserves a few listens. Many big names on this CD. Would i recommend it? Umm...yes and no. If you decide to purchase, don't expect much from it."
4,another great euro-horror from Image!,"Ah, we can always rely on Image entertainment to satisfy our strange desires for Euro-oddities on DVD. This curious erotic vampire tale is, in its original version, actually one of Jesus Franco's best - crude and experimental, yes, but fans of Vampiros Lesbos and the rest of the director's work will know what to expect. Lena Romay, Franco's favourite female star, turns in a fine performance as the mute female vampire, while Franco's ever-wobbly camera seems obsessed with her, lingering over her body in close-up. Expect ample sex, violence, combined with high art, for a unique and satisfying european flick. The scenes of Romay walking through the wood in the fog are amoung the most beautiful Franco ever shot."
3,A Vampire Like No Other,"I wasn't able to finish watching it. Highly provocative for the time it was made, recommended for performances, style and photography."
2,Emanuelle meets the undead.,"I really must alert all of you out there, Do not get this film if you're expecting a nice little vampire picture.The Female Vampire (aka The Bare Breasted Countess) is disturbing. I recieved this sick,sad tale from e-bay a few months ago. Whether you get the SEX version or the BLOOD version, you will be speechless. The sex version has the Vampire walking around nude, all but for a thick leather belt, boots and a cape. She kills her prey via oral intercourse, (she feeds off the hormones) That's the story. The blood version is just as sick. If you like a little nudity with your horror, I'm certain Hammer has something more your style. I'm Not a prude either."
3,Female Vampire,"I'm going to review this for what it was made for, and that is erotikill. I had no clue this was an erotikill until about 5 mins in she got nude with a guy and killed him by basically having sex with him? This threw me off but continued to watch. I would not rate this as 3 stars if this were supposed to be a movie. The people are actually talking in another language and the english voices are voiced over the people so their lips are moving when they aren't talking which is a little weird for me as well. Something that actually kinda irritated me throughout the film is that the same song is played throughout the whole film; and it's played a lot too (probably a good 45 mins of the film)."
4,Great light,It's SO hard to find a decent light for the gameboy system but this one was excellent & made games a lot more fun. The price is right!
3,"good research, bad storyline","I am a complete fan of ancient egypt books. But Jacq's story is not compelling at all. The characters are lame, and the story is just too goody goodys against baddy baddys. Great research into the stuff, it shows hes an expert, at least on egyptian medicine and cooking. But some of the stuff he puts in there, its just a bit too much, he paints Egypt almost as a paradise on earth, and that it certainly wasnt. Then again, its fiction, so i guess its ok. Again, good background, but not good prose. Thats why I gave it 3 stars. I must confess that even though i did not like his style, I still read the 3 books in the series (he he he)."
4,pretty happy with these,"Bought these for my 15 month old new walker. Overall, pretty happy with them, but the soles are not quite as flexible as his Tsukihoshi shoes, which he wears most of the time. They also seem to run a bit narrow, as we were told my son does not have a wide foot, but the velcro on these only buckles half-way across his foot. He likes them, though, and they look nice enough to wear even when semi-dressed up!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK,"All I can say about this book is worthless, useless, because only first 10 pages is usefull. If you want to learn how to write about history, go buy ""A Short Guide to Writing About History"" by Richard Marius."
3,need help this books got answers,This book outlines history in a way i never thought possible. It helped me so much when i had to prepare for a history class in only a couple of minutes. Many of my professors have told me about this book and i agree it is really good.
3,No longer shipping with MaxXTread Komfy-Ride Tires.,"I just received the tricycle so I can't really rate the product yet, but I wanted to leave a comment to inform others that the product is no longer shipping with the MaxXTread Komfy-Ride air tires. These tricycles are now being made using Kettler's Safety Tread tires, which are ""long-lasting dual layer"" plastic tires. I have spoken with Customer Service to see what can be done about this (since air tires was one criteria used for selecting this product over others) and they are looking in to the matter."
4,Son adores this Tricycle,"Our son recieved this tricycle as an early Christmas gift. He adores his tricycle! Every day he's asking if he can ride his bike. I don't know much about the instructions, my husband put the bike together in less then 30 minutes (and he's not the type to really sit down and read the instruction). The tricycle has a good weight to it, something that's going to put up with our son's ""abuse"" so to say. My only complaint, isn't much of one, but our son is still slightly too small for the smallest setting on the tricycle. Although he's two in a half, he is rather tall for his age. I know that in no time he will be at the prefect hieght to start pedaling, but right now he's happy pushing off with his feet."
3,Keep Your Receipt!,"Keep your receipt and information! I purchased this tricycle for my grandson just before his 2nd birthday. He loves it and rides it all over his neighborhood while his Mom pushes the new baby in her stroller. I thought I had purchased a durable toy that would at least survive both children. However, less than 9 months later, almost every plastic piece on the toy is broken. The bike is now unrideable! The plastic fender has cracked. The rear basket is in 2 pieces, the front axel has a plastic clip that the pedals fit into and it has broken as well. The bike is stored in a covered area and has only been ridden by a 2 year old. This is unacceptable. Kettler appears to be willing to replace the parts but needs ALL the purchase information to do so. Since it was a gift, now I am involved in searching for my receipt! For $200 I expected much more."
5,A Man for Amanda,"A Man for Amanda is part of Nora Robert's Calhoun Women series, about four sisters trying to save their castle-like mansion in Maine by having part of it renovated into a hotel while searching for their grandmother Bianca's legendary emerald necklace. Amanda is balancing the above situations while planning C.C.'s wedding and acting as assistant manager at a local hotel. She doesn't count on pencilling easygoing Sloan, the cowboy from Oklahoma whose also head architect for the renovation, into her schedule. His laidback ways drive her crazy, but she can't stop the attraction between them. Add in a touch of danger and you have another irresistable novel by Nora Roberts, with true love and family always present."
3,The mystery continues.,"The last thing Amanda needed was a man in her life, particularly a man who seems to hate her sister, Suzanna. But love waits for no master plan. The mystery of the missing jewels and the story of the ill-fated romance of the past continues. This is a good story, although not as well-defined as COURTING CATHERINE."
2,blah,"Not that impressed with this series. Both books so far have jumped from hating these guys to being in love. I finished it, but it wasn't great."
4,Excellent,I'm really enjoying the story of the Calhoons very hard to put down! Ive always been a big fan of Nora Roberts
3,"Good, however misses one important aspect","I agree with most all of what was written, and the self-assessment portion is critical. With that said, I was the other woman ... I am the only woman now ... and we are not married as neither of us wishes it for us. We lead very separate lives 3000 miles apart 6 months of the year. But, we are truly emotionally intimate at all times. Most importantly, the time we spend together is quality time - we only celebrate one another. There are benefits that could have been covered in this book and I feel they were overlooked."
2,"Blah, Blah, Blah...","Just another book on a topic that is as old as time itself. Men don't leave their wives for the affair partner and since the ""relationship"" is based in lies and deceit it has no legs for the long term. Move on ladies!"
3,"Beautiful, but you have to work for it.","I got this as a gift for my grandmother. She loves it, but if it rains or if there's a big temperature change, she has to get out the metal polish. She said she doesn't mind doing that kind of stuff, but it would bug me to death. I know that letting the metal corrode a little to give it character is part of the description of this item, but I would rather buy it looking shiny and new and have it stay that way."
5,easy but complete approach to mechanical ventilation,I've just begun specialization in ICU and I found this text a very useful and simple approach to mechanical ventilation.It contains all the basic notions you need to understand the base of ventilation in patients who need this kind of support.
4,"Good ""basics"" book","I used this book to study for board exams after practicing critical care ventilation for 3 years. Used it more for the jargon and specific terms than for physiology; it gave me what I needed. I would have liked more example scalars / PV loops, etc. But it has a good basic review of physiology as it pertains to ventilation."
4,Forced to by it for class,"This book was a requirement for class. Book is extremely small for the price. I wish it had questions at the end of each chapter. A workbook would be great with this book. This book does not have the different ventilator brands and modes. For example - Drager, Servo, LTV1000 etc. Our teacher had to require another book just to go over the other brands.Book needs - questions, workbook & chapters with specific ventilators."
5,Creative Form,"There is a reason this book has become the Bible for many forming metalsmiths. It's more than a ""how to"" book. The author seeks to establish a lexicon of stardardized terms to make communication between smiths more exact and fruitful. This is not a book for those just beginning metalsmithing. But those with a solid understanding of the craft and an imagination will find it highly rewarding! It should be kept as a referance in every creative metalsmith's shop."
1,Wrong part,Ordered spark plugs for a 96 Dodge Neon. The wires I got were not for a 96 neon. Didn't try to return them because I was moving and the car was staying.
1,Misleading,I bought these as a christmas gift thinking they were different then the series. I did not read well. My daughters love this series so if you like them also buy the horseland complete series and you will have them all. These other discs are very misleading.
2,Two Episodes?!,"The first thing you realize about this DVD is that it only includes TWO episodes of the show. That's about forty minutes of watching! Usually when a DVD has that few episodes, it comes packaged with a toy or a book. But no, this is all you get for a standalone DVD. So what can I say about the actual show. Well, I am curious as to why there are only like six kids at this big horse camp, but I guess that's not important. I like the dog, pig, and cat A LOT more than the humans and their talking horses. I can't really say much about this show from two episodes, but it looks pretty formulaic."
5,Daughter can't get enough of Horseland videos...,"My daughter loves Horseland... wish there were more videos! We have both videos and she even pretends to ""jump"" with her stick horse just like they do on the video. She is probably a bit too young for them at two and a half but she is pretty much obsessed with horses so one morning when we ran across the cartoon she was hooked!"
3,tailgate lite strip,"I odered 2 for 2 trucks.shipped quick.installed easy enough.but glue wasn't holding up, maybe I didn't clean good enough, instead I drilled holes and screwed into both trucks.One lite still looks good after a month,one lost about 6 leds on rightside after only 2 days. i am writing to company on that now.overall good.updated- Bully never responded to my problem, it eventually lost one side of lites, then melted itself to my truck. i used a chisel to peel it off, it didn't wreck my wire harness tho. It is a no brainer to install, plug in, I am a mechanic and didn't see any error on installing it. probably bad led allowed half to smoke.The other one on wifes truck works fine. I downgraded to 3 star because Bully didn't respond to their defective one. I hope Bully reads this and backs their product up, cause i'm out that money."
2,Bully TLB001 TailGate light strip,Easy to instal.Looked great for the first couple of months.Some LED's started to failRemoved from vehicle.Money down the drain as far as I'm concerned
4,good product - better price,"adorama camera had fantastic price on this product and more than a few others I noticed while browsing. the binoculars are small , lightweight which we were looking for and enough power for sightseeing"
2,Not as presented on webpage,"""What you see on the Amazon website is not what you get. The website picture shows a multi-pack box, and clearly states: ""Size 12 (2 pks)"" and ""Product Dimensions 10x10x4.5 inches"". What is shipped is a single tiny pack. The filters thus cost nearly $5 each, far above retail."""
2,Much lower quality than the originals,"These are very flimsy, cheap filters - not anything like the originals that came with the water dispenser, Keep looking."
2,A little disappointing,"I got this for my cats who love to drink out of the faucet, but this is noting like that. The water trickles down a little ramp, into the bowl, and then back down the ramp. It doesn't really give them the whole running water experience. It is also on the noisy side and will sometimes make a gurgling noise which scares them. I finally gave up on it."
2,Very uncomfortable,I bought these shoes because I am a short person by nature... lol I wanted the height from these shoes... unfortunately they are extremely uncomfortable... It feels like you are wearing hard plastic around your ankles... The first day that I wore these I had bruises on the top of my feet by the end of my day. If your are looking for something comfortable I definitely don't recommend these.
4,Complete Book Of Fuel/Gas Dragsters...,"I got this book because I wanted to bring my drag racing knowledge into the 21st century. It was good but only went up to the 70s. Like others books of this type, it had a lot of history which was duplicated in several other books. Still, for about $15, well worth it."
1,"Nice Idea, But...","The UFOLightis a nice idea. I do like the style of it, but Ido not like the little blinking LED's on the back. Playing Pokeman Crystal in the dark just about drove me crazy. Red and green flashes on the game cart. I went out and bought the Intec Worm light instead."
4,INTERESTING,I can't give it 5 stars because of that slightly disco sound but it is great overall. I strictly buy instrumental music and this is a decent recording of some very good music. It would be higher on my playlist without that distinctive 70's era sound.
2,A Big Disappointment,I bought the CDs because I thought they were essential to be able to use the book that goes with them effectively. When I listened to the CD I found out I was wrong. They are hard to understand especially if you are not used to having to make distinctions between UK and US English. The dialogues were extremely difficult to follow and understand for me anyway. I quickly discovered that you could effectively use the book without using the CDs at all. I've gotten a lot of use out of the book but I've used the CDs once or twice. I definitely do not recommend them.
5,Eibach pro kit,"Eibach pro kit springs are a great product, great quality, rides very nice. Good for someone who is looking for a mild drop on their car. The only bad thing is if you have a 4 cyl it does not lower the front as much as it says or as much as it would on a v6. It gave me about 3/4"" of drop on the front of my ford fusion and 1 1/2"" on the rear."
2,Issue of a Warning,"To all those who hope to read this book, don't. I was given two monthes to do so, and was still unable to finish it because it is impossible to read more than 2 lines at a time. It is incredibly boring, and I recomend it only to those who want to know every little insignifcant aspect of Penn's life."
4,Lux Thermostat,"I purchased this item from an Home Improvement store.When I went back to purchased another,they didn't carry it .This themostat is easy to install and operate."
5,Fascinating World!,"Other reviews have discussed the steerswoman principle; I will focus more on the world.As an sf reader, it's really clear that these humans are colonizing and gradually terraforming a new planet. They have also lost a lot of tech, including electricity; the few humans able to work with that are the ""wizards"", which is apparently a closely inbred and secretive clan.This makes these books a really delightful combination of science fiction and fantasy, with intelligent protagonists who are beginning to put all this together.Occasionally the heroes fall into the Sherlock Holmes trap, where they come up with accurate insights based on what seem like fairly specious clues. Mostly, though, it makes sense, and we learn things as they do... though a wider grasp of sf does give one a broader context in which to look at the world.Fascinating! and very well-written, with persuasive and engaging characters and a compelling plot, as well as an intriguing world."
5,"Wonderful, Delightful, Great reading!!! Loved this book....","Janelle Taylor does it again. Wild Winds, what a great believable story. Wonderful, colorful characters, caring, needing... Hawk Reynolds, strong, handsome, sexy and half Cheyenne!! yes!! Maggie Malone, woman of my heart. Fearless, strong, sexy - a dangerous combination in a woman falls in love with Hawk, dark, dangerous and oh so daring. They both seek out the truth yet are hesitant about how they feel, lies, confusion only add to the mystery of this story. Can't put the book down. Read it and love it..."
1,Oh Please!!!,"Silliest book I ever read. People just don't talk this way in real life. I hate to start a book and not finish it, but I could not read this stupid book.I can't tell you how many times through the first 100 pages that I just stopped and shook my head in disbelief at the juvenile dialog in this book.Don't bother - it's in my trash can."
3,Okay,"I thought the writing was simple. I did not read to me the way people would actually talk to each other and that kept me from enjoying the book as much as I could have. And I got so tired of ""partner"" and ""women."" It was just not my taste."
2,Cheap knock off of good coil hoses,"We had one of these coil hoses (from Williams Sonoma, or Brookstone, or Restoration Hardware or similar) for a long time until I hit it with the lawn mower. This one looks the same, but it's not. The plastic is more rigid. It kinks easily. It doesn't retract to it's coil state well or quickly. It tangles on itself more easily.Pay the extra for a good one."
2,A disappointment after a week.....,"After going back and forth as to which coiled hose to opt for, I went for this median priced hose. I have several coiled hoses that I've previously bought in person, but thought I'd check out the online options. This hose looks great in the photo, was quickly shipped and looked good out of the package. I'm disappointed however in that after about a week, the vinyl hose separated from the metal coupling, at the end where the nozzle attaches. This hose watered not only my orchids, but me, the deck, the house, you get the picture. Granted, I think I can fix the problem by buying a metal clamp, but I shouldn't have to on a brand new hose. Do know that I don't put undue stress on these hoses so this was a manufacturing issue. Perhaps it's not the norm, but this one was a bummer."
3,bounce back hose quality,"The bounce back hose is great for use on our porch. 50 ft covers the reach needed. However, I am on my 3rd hose in 5 years due to the previous ones developing pin hole leaks. So if you need a compact hose roll up for 1 1/2 years I recommend this hose."
5,Great Great learning game.,"Top Trumps is absolutely huge in England for a reason. It is addicting. Not only is it similar to war. It is better than war. You actually get to choose which part of your card you will use to fight the opponent. So instead of just saying oh you king beat my queen. You look at your card and say oh this guy is really tall, so I bet my guys height will beat your guy's height. This game really shines when you get educational topic tops trumps like animal preditors or space objects. This is a brilliant rivia game that requires no prior knowlege. [...] harry potter, Sharks, soccer teams, space objects, jets, super cars. Get this game. But do yourself a favor and get some of the educational decks."
4,An Inside View of NASCAR,"I'm not a racing fan, but I am a person who enjoys a good book with a great story. In The NASCAR Way, Robert Hagstrom takes the reader into every facet of the sports organization that is NASCAR. If you have an appreciation for the sport, this will be a great book for you, if not, you like me may gain an appreciation of both the sport and the NASCAR way of doing things. How this empire rose from a few bootleggers engaging in afternoon challenges to a multi-billion dollar industry is fascinating. Perhaps the most fascinating of all is the way this business works together at every level, from upper management, to track personnel, to racing teams and corporate sponsors, to the huge retail business, to loyal fans that fuel the entire machine with their support.I highly recommend The NASCAR Way, I found it to be both enjoyable and a real learning experience."
4,"Good, But More Depth Needed","I would have appreciated a greater discussion about the profitablility of sponsorship of cars and drivers and why some of the lesser teams have problems attracting sopnsors. Otherwise book is OK. But reader beware: with Nascar now planning to negotiate all TV contracts, instead of the individual tracks, ""The Nascar Way"" may already be out-of-date."
2,"Find better elsewhere, for less $","The quality is less than what you could find in-store at target or wal-mart, but it costs more. I returned it because it only has elastic on the 2 ends, so the fabric does not lie flat and snugly around a standard crib mattress. Better crib sheets have elastic all around the edges. Instead of buying this, check out local stores for better quality and save $3-4 dollars.Also, the color is not a nice blue."
3,Passing marks for this one!!!,"This product is deserving of just passing marks. Firstly, it does not have enough capacity to collect a lot of dust. It gets heated up very quickly. So, there is a problem there. I would not buy it again or even a similar product again. Better to clean your car with the traditional vacuum cleaner."
5,I loved this book!,My son's name is Kai. He is autistic and has lots of fears that can be tough to work through with spoken word. Sometimes he finds connections through books or movies and I'm hoping he will find a good lesson in this story. Maybe one day he will appreciate (and not be afraid of) what his name means.
3,Cosi-cosi......,"I initially bought these for my car simply due to the humour of them. I liked the donut fragrance but these last way shorter than others (much cheaper from the grocery store) that I've bought. I now collect them, but if you're serious about scent possibly try a different brand."
2,Very little additional insight,"There's very little in here that isn't in the help system. I've really tried to get some value out of it, but so far it hasn't told me anything that wasn't obvious. I thought that it might at least help me make some sense out of Quicken's somewhat clunky interface, but it doesn't, for the simple reason that it is a robotic transcription of the software to book form.If you're new to computers and find it easier to deal with books than software then I suppose it might be of some value. I can't really say. But if you're new to home finance software (like me) and comfortable with computers then this is one entry that you can leave off your ledger."
3,Read as a cautionary tale,"While I felt the pain Ms. Aviles experienced during her oddessy through the seemingly difficult machinations of the penal system, I never felt a sense of acknowledgement of her son's probable involvment in drug dealing. What should have been presented as a cautionary tale for young people to avoid becoming involved in drug dealing, instead read like: ""don't get caught with drugs."" Nevertheless, it was a moving, wrenching read and I recommend it for mothers and fathers whose children are vulnerable to the lure of the street, as well as all who want a good read."
5,Great Beginning Book for outdoor survival for kids!,"I have 6 children ages 3-14 who are homeschooled. We have been doing Wilderness Awareness as part of our science. Willy Whitefeather's Outdoor Survival Handbook for Kids is great! Like an above review, it is a little cheesy, but it has helped my kids to get the information to sink in. My older 3 boys have been learning survival skills since they were little, and even they picked up a few unknown facts! My 6 year old and 9 year old benefited the most from this book. Although, even my 2 youngest...3 and 4 years of age remember some of the things in the book.If you are looking for more curriculum, may I suggest Kamana for kids...available from the Wilderness Awareness School in Washington State. They have classes, but they also sell curriculum for kids and adults in their store.And for older children, I would suggest any of Tom Brown's books or-The Boy's Book of Outdoor Survival: 101 Courageous Skills for Exploring the Dangerous Wild by Chris McNab."
2,clever but hard to read,print/font is hard to read - too busy! but content is fun and practical - helpful - just not the easiest read.
3,"A little cheesy, but with good advice.","This book is a little cheesy, and the illustrations weren't that great. However, it does have a lot of survival tips in it. I am pretty sure that there are better outdoor survival books for young boys and girls."
1,Used? or knock-off? sold as New,"One set of baby dishes was marked in such a way as to appear used. Not Royal Doulton quality. A knock-off, maybe?"
4,Baby Boy,Royal Doulton is a timeless classic....this pattern is especially well suited for a little boy with lots of blues. Coupled with Beatrix Potter stories it was a huge hit at the baby shower....and I know the baby's grandmother is going to enjoy having the stories to read.
5,Great Plug,"I am very pleased with my purchase, this is my second plug, and it feels great! I would not recommend this to a beginner. The plug stays in for a long period of time, and is comfortable to wear, a water based solution is recomended for insertion, once in your feeling good!"
3,Great Tantus quality,The picture is deceptive. It's much bigger than it looks. Larger than most toys we already have from same manufacturer.
1,Are you Kidding,"This thing is so small, it looks like it should be a key chain. I do not know what the purpose of this is for, it is not enjoyable at all."
2,Too big,Bought it for my wife but its way bigger than it appeared to be. It seemed a perfect size in the pic but its pretty big .
2,Not recommended,"The workout is very simple, I would not even call work out, but it is fun and introduces few moves and steps of different type of dances. The biggest drawdown, the camera focuses too much on faces. The workout mostly about steps that involves lower body, especially legs, but camera most of the time shows participats upper body, which is so annoying because have no idea what moves they are doing and I was constantly behind the moves because camera shows too much upper body and you kind of have to guess what moves they are doing with lower body. Not recommended. There is better choices of dance workouts."
5,Read This Book!,"I highly recommend that you read this book everyone because it is funny, realistic, and sad. Laurie Halse Anderson makes this book very realistic. She doesn't make all the puppies live, healthy, and cared for like in a fairy tale, she makes them sick, small, weak, and neglected. Also she doesn't make Maggie smart and perfect, she makes Maggie a person who hates school and who can't do well in school. Fight for Life is also very funny because one time Maggie's Grandma calls her teacher while grooming a dog. When Maggie's grandma tells the dog to sit down and not to get so worked up, the teacher thinks that she is talking to her! Fight for Life is sad because someone is abusing the dogs and not caring for them that well, which results in the puppies getting very sick and some puppies dying. This book was great and I recommend that you get it and read it."
2,You get what you pay for,"I read the reviews from others and I guess I was expecting a little more cushion between discs. Yes, the flaps are still intact and you have to ""open"" each one before you can slide a disc in. Annoying but do-able. It's an okay little case. Zipped close it looks like one of those expensive ones, so be careful where you leave it. I bought two and it's serving its purpose."
3,"Okay, but peeling plastic a pain","I got it a few days ago and the first thing I saw I had to do was remove the plastic sections sealing each pocket because they hadn't already done so. Without removing that plastic area, you couldn't put in a CD. This was a real pain to do and took over an hour. Other than that, it is working out good so far."
3,Decent,"Decent product; may be a little ""cheap"", but if you use it mainly for storing CDs with old pictures, or CDs with songs that you barely use anymore, it will do its job very well."
3,Minor annoyances...,"Overall this CD/DVD binder is pretty good. Appears to be decent quality, although I haven't had it long so I don't know how long it will last. The one major issue I had with it was having to pull apart each individual slot for the discs. I filled it right away so had to spend a while peeling off all the perforated pieces in order to open the slots for the discs. Other than that, so far it's been just fine for a CD/DVD case."
3,Great economical choice,"Solid base construction, good zipper. Plastic casing is flimsy but not unusual in a travel DVD binder. It can be challenging in the car and the zipper is awkward, but sturdy. Reasonable product, reasonable service and price. Excellent seller, shipper and experience."
1,Cheap quality,The slots to put the cd's in are very flimsy so it's hard to slide them in at times and I don't expect it to last long.
3,Picture not accurate,"The picture is of a product that is square ... the dimensions tell you the real story - namely that the the case if two discs high, so rectangular in shape, which is not really what I was looking for. The product itself appears to be fine - it's a bit frustrating having to remove a little part of each of the sleeves, to create a space for discs."
2,"Cheap, cheap, cheap","Cheaply made. Spend a few more bucks for something better. I haven't had the problems with pages ripping out like others described, but I'm sure it's coming. Just opening it up, you can tell it's cheaply made and will probably tear soon."
3,Flimsey but does the job,I though this was a single holder but it was a double holder. Its pretty flimsey but it does the job.
2,False picture,The picture you see is not the actual item. The Case is much larger and longer than this picture. I bought it because I thought it was compact but its long the material used to hold the cd's are flimsy. They seller should really change this pic...false advertising.
5,Great Buy,"i bought quite a few of these milwaukee router bits to replace some old hand me downs that were wore out.these bits are, in my opinion, an outstanding buy for the price. a solid bit that cuts great. not a whole lot more to add.if you are getting started in woodworking and are sceptical about spending $50 + per bit, try these first and you wont be disappointed."
2,"Tinny, electronic sound",I was expecting a music experience in 3D sound reality. What I got was very poor electronic music that sounded very amateurish. What a waste of money. Don't buy this.
1,WARNING - NOT LIVE MUSIC!,"Wouldn't you know, the first time I purchase something without reading customer reviews I get burned!I Purchased this title because of the DTS HD Master Audio track and because I assumed it was a surround sound mix of an orchestra playing Bach. Quite the contrary - this is no more than a synthesizer playing out of all my speakers. Now if it was really well done I'd probably be happy anyway but it's not. I'd have to agree with another poster that said it had a monotone sound. The whole thing's just weird!"
4,Fantastic,"The outside of the mug can come off if cleaned in the dishwasher or with anything abrasive (as the box warns)--so just use soap and water. I assume this is why the other reviewer had a problem. Otherwise it's awesome. The cat ""disappears"" pretty well, although the ink isn't 100% invisible (it turns into a very faint yellow tinge). Still, good enough to be pretty amusing (to me) and worth the money."
3,Not sure how to wash this mug.,"This was bought as a Christmas gift for my daughter. The mug is great; cool artwork and the letters disappear they way are supposed to. Our problem is with washing the mug. As instructed we've always handwashed it. However, after a few uses the lettering started to wipe off, no matter how careful we tried to be. If not for the issue with the lettering this mug would receive 5 stars."
1,Lame mug,I used it twice and the second time I hand washed it all of the picture on the mug came off. I'm really pissed.
2,chesire cat mug,this was not worth the money I spent on it. the cat does disappear but only until you drink a sip or two out of the cup.
2,"Nice looking mug, if just want a decoration","I bought this for my wife. It's a very nice looking mug. Cheshire disappears when filled with hot liquid. But after just one wash some of the paint started flaking off. After the second wash the letters flaked off and more of the art work. My wife followed all directions about not soaking the mug, not using too hot water, etc. Yet the paint still came off. Don't buy if you actually plan to use this mug!"
1,"Image washed off, again!,,","This was the second cup our son received. He got the first from his uncle and grandma accidentally put it in the dishwasher where the image melted down the side of the mug. She replaced it and we were careful to gently hand wash it. After only a couple of weeks the image again ""melted"" down the mug. Not worth it!"
4,Not exactly new,"The mug I ordered is awesome, it arrived very quickly and the cat does disappear which is cool. The problem is the mug package was taped shut with packing tape and looked like it was stuffed in someone's closet for a few years, and the mug handle has 3 chips in it where it is painted black, so the white chips are pretty noticeable. I expected new from the description stating it was new, so I was a little disappointed, but it arrived quickly and otherwise is in good condition."
3,Cute but not durable,I love Alice in wonderland and got this as a gift from my In laws. It's super cute and keeps my coffee hot for awhile. After about 3 weeks though the letters have started to rub off. I only hand wash it and most times just rinse it. The rest of the design seems fine though.
3,MUG FADES,I bought this same mug at disneyland for 14 dollars and I was so excited to finally use it. The first time I ever washed it the letters came off and I was so disappointed. I was very upset because I paid more money then a typical mug and I feel that it was so cheaply made. If not for the letters coming off I would really love this mug. I have NO IDEA why it is so expensive if it is NOT good quality.
5,Harbinger gloves.,These are the best gloves made IMO. I have them in both styles... with and without wristwraps and I have had more than one pair.
2,Odd,"The entire palm of these gloves is a thickish rubber/silicon material which feels strange when you're gripping a bar. I like the brand and the finger length, but I'll try to find some without that rubber palm in the future."
3,Hard to get a proper grip,"I had the same exact problem that Sylvia R had. The hard leather portion on the palm of the glove is not flexible. When I would grip my hand around the bar, the leather portion would create a big lump and would not allow me to get my hand comfortably around the bar. While with most lifts it was not an issue, with some, especially when I was using heavier weights, it was an issue and several times I had to let go because I couldn't keep a grip on the bar anymore. During these specific types lifts where I found it hard to get a grip on the bar with the gloves, I actually was able to lift easier and actually heavier when I took the gloves off. The gloves are OK, but the inflexible leather portions make it difficult to get a grip on the bar."
3,not that great,"I am a fan of Harbinger gloves. I bought these gloves because I lift 4 to 5 days a week and wanted something that provided superior wear, comfort, and functionality. The gloves are constructed well but the rubber inserts ruin the glove. They are very stiff and even after break in are still uncomfortable. I've torn almost all the rubber nubs off the fingers, the palm rubber is still in good shape. Any grip advantage you have with these gloves is negated by how uncomfortable they are. If your main reason for considering these gloves are for grip I'd suggest using straps with your existing gloves."
3,thick gloves,"nice gloves, can be difficult to hold weights 2/2 thickness of rubber pads, but are well made."
3,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"Having purchased these gloves in Jan.'07, and this being only March, they are already falling apart. The stitching on both pinky fingers is ripping! Which would not be so bad if they weren't almost $32.00. Save you money and buy 3 pairs of gloves at Wal-mart!"
1,not recommended,"I have used harbinger training gloves for the past 10 years and consider harbinger gloves one of the best on the market for those who weightlift. I decided to try out these gloves, and was very disappointed. I thought the rubber palm pads was a good idea, but I found them too thick and stiff making it very difficult to grip and very awkward. I would not recommend these gloves."
5,Great Gloves,"I've had a pair for a little over a year and they are the best gloves I've ever used. I've destroyed every pair of gloves i've owned (Harbinger training grip's, Nike's, and Atlas) and these have really held up. They are starting to come apart right now, but they have been used 4 times a week so it is expected. It took about a month to really break these gloves in, but once they get broken in, all of the thumb pains will go away, and the rubber will start to loosen up. They are really worth the extra $."
5,Worth the time of break-in,"The gloves at first seem very stiff and actually uncomfortable to wear but once you get over the break in time, these gloves are great. Very comfortable and dont feel awkward at all. The rubber padding really helps with grip, so much that you dont even really have to think about slipping when you go to lift. also make heavy presses a little easier on the hands."
4,My own opinion,"Ok, so I wanted to use these for some time before I wrote a review of what I thought. Now they are indeed tuff and durable I might add. They are very good workout gloves and my grips on the free weights and bars did improve with these. The only downside is how tuff they are in the beginning to brake in. I was surprised at the amount or rubber used in the glove but thats what makes it so tuff and have a good grip. It took me about 7 gym visits using these gloves before they broke in good and werent bothering me while wearing them. I still would recommend them overall."
2,incommodious gloves,"This gloves are hard to adjust to. Save your money; not only are they expensive, but impractical. These gloves are not meant for heavy lifting. They have great padding, but the design makes this counter intuitive. The extra padding and lining put stress and/or pain on your fingers. I don't see a point in cutting them shorter if you want to protect your entire finger from calluses, especially after you spent more money for what you thought were functional, aesthetic gloves. These are useless for heavy lifting; I may just add them to my motorcycle attire to make them handy."
5,You'll love it!,"I LOVE this book! I want a smart and clever book that I can't put down and when I do finish it I keep thinking about the characters. I want to laugh and cry and be surprised by some of the twists and turns of the plot. Riding with the Queen fits all my criteria for a great read. Tallie is a rough character, but you know she has to be protecting herself from something so you ride with her on her way back home to find out what it is. Tallie and all of the characters are very real. I cringed when she was messing up, I applauded when she was trying to change and I cracked up at her often. I was just plain entertained. My favorite character is the Queen. Who doesn't need a dead Delta Blues Queen looking after her? Buy it and read it, you'll love it too!"
2,Too Dysfunctional,"I wanted to love this book. I loved Jennie Shortridge's second novel ""Eating Heaven"". This book was too sad with too many messed up people including the main character Tallie. I love Tallie's passion for music and I did route for her, but she is as messed up in many ways as her Mother. I felt the sister Jane was protrayed badly, and should have been given more sympathy. Jane was the one who stayed and took care of her mother. Jeanie Shortridge has talent but this book wasn't it at least for me."
3,A few great recipes,"There are a few really good recipes here. Most of the rest are okay. Some recipes need better instructions. For example, when you're working with candy, you really need to understand when things are done. To rely on your eye or on the ""water test"" is only good for experienced candymakers. I have adopted one of the peanut brittle recipes and have never made any brittle that was better. So, I do recommend the book, but I would also encourage you to get a more descriptive volume as well. If you can find the Pope School book on Candymaking, I'd get that. You could find it in used book stores."
5,The Everything Bridge Book,Absolutely a must for any beginner. Easy to understand and presented in a logical form that allowed me to begin playing with a club in record time. I have recommended this book to many others already.
4,A nice introduction to Bridge,"My husband and I have taken some beginning bridge lessons, and found this book a good review."
2,Game Plan,"I recommend this book to anyone that likes football. It is filled with friendship and excitement. For example, Marty almost broke his arm in the game and Beano would have to use Dave for quarterback. It also teaches you two lessons - always give someone another chance and always believe in yourself. Another example for friendship is between Beano and Mr. Custer. Mr. Custer taught Beano all the lessons in this novel. ""I know you can coach this team Beano,"" Mr. Custer said. It's also amazing how in the beginning Marty hated Beano and then in the end they became great friends. Marty said this in the locker room "" Your no coach Beano,"" in the beginning of the novel. In the end, after the game he said,"" We couldn't of done it with out you Beano"" It's just weird that one-day you hate someone then the next, your good friends with him or her. So in conclusion, if you are into football, friendship and excitement you'll love Game Plan."
3,A Book Of Faith!,"Hubert (Beano) Hatton is the student manager of the Barton High Tigers football team. After a victory with one game left in the season, the head coach gets in an accident and can't coach the chamionship game. The principal of the school gives Beano the coaching job. The quarterback of the team doesn't like that idea and quits. How will Beano handle the loss of the star quarterback? This is an exciting book. It isn't the best book you'll ever read, but it is pretty good. If you ever have spare time Game Plan is the book to read."
4,This was a gift,This was a gift but appears to be in the condition that I expected and the information that I expected.
3,book is ok if you have no idea what goes into a roof?,"The book does not cover very much in detail about roof systems. If you have never done a roof, or have no idea what goes into a roof, then this book is a good general reference book on roofing. I must say all the Black and Decker books (same company that own Dewalt) are about the same. They give you vague general premises on the ins and outs of the proposed task they cover. If you really want a good skilled trades book buy something from Taunton press. There books are written by pros who have been in there vocation for decades. If your a skilled tradesman reading up on how to replace your roof, and looking for some advice on it then this is not the book for you!"
5,Awesome Book,"I found this book really simplified certain parts of the swing, specifically the slot on the downswing, that are not given enough attention in golf books. I wish I read this 20 years ago, it would helped me get it earlier. Good pictures illustrating the concept. Strongly recommended."
4,This book and Martin Dyckman's book are two excellent biographies regarding former Florida Gov. LeRoy Collins.,"This book and Martin Dyckman's book are two excellent biographies regarding former Florida Gov. LeRoy Collins.Both are well worth reading, however Martin Dyckman's book is the better of the two. Also available at Amazon.Dyckman's book has a 2006 copyright. Dyckman's book is titled: ""Floridian of His Century: The Courage of Governor LeRoy Collins.""Martin Dyckman has been associated with the St. Petersburg Times for decades. He is one of Florida's greatest journalists and columnists."
4,"Three aircraft, three diffent responses","There are three different aircraft in this video, all coming from Riga, Latvia, to various destinations in Europe and Africa. There are day and night flights, short and long flights, and other varieties as well. Good scenery, quality video, though not as good as the new HD stuff.Where this video lets us down is in the cockpit. The 757 sequences are excellent, with some of the most thorough explanations and clear demonstrations you'll see. In the Fokker 50 and 737 sequences, we watch, but get little extra. Some of these flights, though obviously a couple hours in real life, are cut to 10 minutes on the DVD. So I give it a 5 for the 757, which is half the DVD, and a 3 for the other half, which is partly 50 and partly 737, so we end up with the 4.Worth owning, but of somewhat uneven quality among the aircraft types."
4,Action Hero,"My [...]son is a huge Sonic fan, I bought this figure to go along with the small Sonic bendable pack for his Birthday. He loves all of them. So far it seems well built."
4,Actual dimensions posted,"Dimensions listed in description are wrong. See Product Images, I've posted an image of the correct dimensions of the item I received. Use them for planning only, Northern Tool may change suppliers or have multiple suppliers. Added metric dimensions."
1,hour meter stops time,"This hour meter was chosen for it's low price ... after install,the meter clicked and ran fine,for a whopping three tenths of an hour. would not recomend this meter needless to say.I called the supplier and was toldthat the failure rate used to be 40% but was now at 1.5%. My reply was it must be my lucky day.It's now been three weeks and a promised replacement is a no show"
3,Works Great but...,I would have rated this item with 5 stars but it leaks. Easily installed and works as advertised. Have ordered several and put them on all my equipment that I want to keep up with maintenance intervals. Very good price. Put one on my JD mower but it leaks and moisture collects making it impossible to see the reading. It will eventulally dry out but it takes a long time. The lesson is - be careful how you wash around this item.
1,review my purchase,it only had four songs for the price I paid I wished it had more songs for the pricesorry
1,hard on the ears,"I would describe myself as a moderately enthusiastic GBV fan. I really like some of their studio stuff, but this 2-disc live CD really blew my mind because it was so truly awful. Only good thing was the playlist. The sound was atrocious; the introductions were annoyingly self celebratory, when there was no rationale for celebration. considering the poor performjance, especially regarding the (attempted) vocal harmonies."
3,cute toy,"The best part about this toy is the way it looks. The colors are bright and it is very cute. The music is impossible to play, it's very difficult to get the squeekers in the legs to make any noise even for me let alone my baby. Overall I like the toy but it seems to be a little musically challenged."
3,Stupid Turtle,Cons Wel I was expecting some awasome product at very good price but seems worth of price. Clueless design and legs dont make much of sound. One need to press very hard to get sound which kids can never expected to do.Pros : Attractive colors nice smily face
1,Don't waste your time!,"I tried this model out for a total of 30 minutes. The steam could barely move surace mildew on the marble walls of my shower. One of the brushes had its bristles mangled after about 30 seconds of usage. All in all, this product was a big disappointment and I returned it for a refund."
3,Mother of 3,"I just bought this steamer last week. It was a good price and small which allows for easy storage. However, I have never used one before and it does not have very clear or good instructions. I also found it too small to complete almost any task. It runs out of pressure and then water fast. But does cool down and warm up quickly. I have cleaned the bathroom kichen and the truck seats as well as the baby's car seat. I found it works best on small projects. It works especially well on mirrors. My baby had spilled formula milk on her blue carseat and it took that stain out in a matter of seconds. Be sure to have another cloth handy because this machine only loosens the debri it does not pick it up."
2,not up to expectations,"The main body of the steamer is well made. Some of the attachments are of very poor quality. They either don't fit well, break easily, or deform from the heat very easily. They are made of very cheap or recycled plastic. (If a vacuum hose detaches while you are using it is not a big deal. If the steamer hose detaches while you are using it is is a very big deal.) The steam alone does not clean but only softens the grime, that must then be wiped away."
2,Not Durable; Expensive Refurb,"I've had one of these for a couple of years, but only had occasion to use it 3 or 4 times. I think it works great for small jobs, when it works. I used mine exactly as directed, then stored it away in a closet for a year of so.When I took it back out I found it leaks steam everywhere, and scalds my hands. Company (topinnovations-- makes many brands of these) says send it back (my expense) with a check for $22, and they will fix or replace it. I can find a new one on sale for $29, IF I dare buy another!It turned out the plastic tube inside the unit had cracked apart, for no reason, while sitting in my linen closet. Tried to fix with super glue, but the repair did not hold up to the steam even for a minute. Unless and until the company switches to more durable materials that don't spontaneously disintegrate, only buy one of these if you can afford to use it a few times in the first few months, then throw it away."
1,Old poster,"I ordered this to replace a much loved copy that got destroyed in the move. However, this poster was too small and it had yellowing edges like it had been in the sun for a long time. I gave it away instead."
4,Fast and furious!,"Though the actual mechanics of the nefarious plot can get confusing and far-fetched at times, it does not distract the reader from the main narrative, which flies along at a crackling pace. Forsyth expertly notches up the suspense with no letup, even when the story makes a huge turn close to the halfway mark. I was expecting a slowdown at that point, but the story races ahead so smoothly that I couldn't help but continue reading (and this was at 4am!).The plot has aged, having been overtaken by world events since its publication, and the characters are not fully realised, but the taut, focused writing makes up for all the shortcomings. A very satisfying read that beats, hands down, most thrillers of more recent vintage. Not many books are like that nowadays. What a pity."
4,"excellent, the thrill of the chase, the story in two halves","Several stories in one, the background desire for oil and power over where it comes from, the kidnap of the President's son and then the chase for teh culprits. Wonderfully crafted and woven together. More brilliance from the 'Master storyteller'"
4,"Rather unbelievable, but fun","I like Forsyth's work very much, but this tale was rather far fetched in parts to put it mildly. He tells a good story though, you just need to leave your incredulity behind at times and just go with the flow! Not his best, but it won't put me off reading more of his novels, they always entertain."
2,Don't sell musty old books,The book was musty smelling and so yellowed it's not very easy to read.I'll stick with books from other sellers
4,SKA ska SkA!,"Funky Christian ska for the devoted!Positive and peppy (as all ska is!) with a truth mode that gives glory to the Lord Jesus, where it belongs!""Boss Man"" takes you on an adventure with a poor guy in today's world. He gives his meager FastFood restaurant job earnings to someone (he really needed the cash) and ends up getting blessed back later. Clever lyrics, makes you laugh.""Damascus"" is our favorite. Speaks of the story from the Bible of a religious freak on the road to Damascus to kill more Christians and ends up having an ENCOUNTER with God. Song gets pretty wild.Stays true to ""ska"" and remains ""funky"" as it should!"
2,Not enough pressure,The pressure this unit creates is not sufficent for cleaning without scrubing. Would not buy it again and do not recommend.
1,Just stops working,"When it worked, it would take out basic stains with much patience. An ok machine. Here is the theme you will find for those that use this more than a few times... one day you'll be using it, or you'll take it out right when you need it.. and it won't power on. There are no circuits or parts to replace, it just stops working. If you are within warranty you'll have issues getting support, and if you are outside warranty there is nothing to do but trash it and buy another.We had ours just over a year and one day it worked, the next it won't power on. Thats it... you will eventually have this happen to you too.Suggestion = buy something that will last and has good support... unless you don't mind spending the money on 4-5 uses."
3,steam cleaner,a bit clumsy & no bag for storage but love the floor peicee used to have a hand held steamer and maybe had more power to it
3,good but not great,"The tools are lame. They melt under the heat but if they were more durable, this product would be GREAT. It heats fast and steam cleaning is good. I am leary about it being our only cleaning method. If you have heavy soil, don't expect it to be a miracle cleaner because it won't. The brushes clean the grout well but they don't hold up under the heat. The scrub pad cleans the tile well but again, it doesn't hold up under the heat. I end up using the steam and then wiping it with a cloth (with rubber gloves on). I think that this is the best way to use this product. I haven't tried a separate scrub brush with the steam. This might also be an option."
4,Good for furniture but not for tile.,"This steam cleaner works great at getting smells out of couches, beds, and other items made of cloth-like material; such as shoes. I tried it in the bathroom and it was useless. It cannot remove junk from tiles or hard water stains in the shower. Also, you must move slowly because it is not powerful. It will take about 20 minutes to clean a couch. I still think it is great for the money."
1,Disappointed in customer service,"I knew .01 for this steamer was too good to be true. I quickly placed my order because there was only ""1"" left . Gladly paid the 14.95 for shipping and handling. The order was successful I couldn't wait to receive it . Just received an emai that my order was cancelled because they made a mistake. Correct me if I'm wrong but doesn't retailers have to honor whatever price the post? If they post for 99.00 is it ok to up the price after an order is placed.Just disappointed that they didnt take hit on this one."
1,deceiptful shipping costs,I was about to buy this because the price and product looked good. I was suprised to see shipping and handling is $30. This is really deceiptful. Don't buy from this seller.
1,Worthless piece of trash.,"THis is the worst purchase I have ever made. I can point the steam at my hand from 6 inches and it is not even WARM. It will not sterilize a single thing. It does not clean ANYTHING! If you live near Raleigh NC you can come get my unit for free. DO NOT BUY it, my piece of junk Shark Steamer is 5x better than this piece of junk. I've never written a review, but this thing is SO BAD I felt it necessary to warn people. I bought it to use on my hardwood floors, it leaves so much water behind you have to towel dry it!"
4,Wish I had Read These Reviews,"I wish I had read these reviews before getting a t600. My neighbor has one of these and loves it. The t600 comes from some small company in Canada. Reliable Corporation. What junk. And the company I ordered from, Vapor Clean Products (Florida) is absolutely useless. They know nothing and care about you even less. Next time I'll read before I buy. The t600 doesn't come with a safety cap so watch out. It makes real hot steam. If it hits you...it hurts."
1,MC-1275,Should not be called 'heavy duty'. I returned it in a day and want to know the status of my return. Did not perform to advertised expectations.
1,Don't buy any Shark,"I wish I could give it ZERO STARS1 Less than a year ago we bought a Shark Euro Pro S3325 Steamer. Recently we broke an attachment that is vital to the steaming process, an angle adapter. Maybe a $10-$15 item. Shark Company tells us they no longer carry that piece. Therefore our $180 Shark is uselessBe forewarned that if you buy any Shark product the same could happen to you."
3,"Okay, but not great","Did clean some things, but did not clean my shower mold. We moved into a new home and wanted to get all the dirt out from the last family. This was helpful on the countertop tile dirt, but not shower mold. Does work and clean well, just not all the things I had hoped or with the power I was expecting."
4,McCulloch MC 1275 Heavy Duty Steam Cleaner,"Excellent and effective cleaner. Nothing worked on my tiles except this powerful steamer. As a result, I was able to clean my bathroom grout and tile to like new. This machine will save anyone hours and hours of work, such as having to retile or regrout an entire bathroom.Great product! A time and money saver as well.Rosemary"
1,Doesn't work on mold in a shower,"I was hoping this would diminish my reliance on chemicals to clean my tile shower. I have a bit of a mold build up in the grout and spend a lot of time with tooth brushes and bleach. I read all of the reviews and even called customer service at the manufacturer part way through. It just isn't doing much. The bristles on the plastic brushes they supply just can't get in there. I even tried aiming the steam right from the nozzle without a brush and then scrubbing it with yet another toothbrush. This was the primary purpose for the purchase, so I can't help if you are looking to do other things."
2,Please don't waste your money on it,"Not a very good steam cleaner; with 48 oz water the steam lasted just 15 minutes and i wasn't satisfied with cleaneing. Came with some parts missing,too!"
1,waste of time and money,"I purchased this machine and returned it the same day. I tried to clean everything from tile grout to soap scum to stove eyes and it was unacceptable on all. Yes, it made a lot of noise and steam came from the nozzle but for all it's huffing and puffing it could not do the job."
5,Heavy Duty,"This is a heavy duty cleaner. I like it because it rolls around on wheels and you don't have to carry anything. It does a good job on floors, but don't expect miracles. It can't take all the stains out of my old bathtub."
4,"Good product, poor customer service","I've used my Steamfast several times. The last time I used it was on the big seal around my front loading washer. Did great. I mostly bought it to clean my shower--to remove the soap scum from the tile. It does okay for that, but doesn't get it all. My only real complaint was that the first time I used the Steamfast one of the sponge/scrubber attachments fell apart. It's not a huge problem, HOWEVER, I have emailed the company TWICE and they haven't responded. Emailed them the 3rd time today. Thought I'd do a review to let other folks know."
4,Almost perfect,"I found the steam cleaner to be all that it was advertised to be with one little exception. Some of the attachments (brushes and scrub pads) simply didn't last beyond one or two uses. In the case of the scouring pad, the glue that was holding it to the plastic attachment simply melted with the use of the steam.The larger attachments and brushes work fine and are very useful. The machine generates a generous amount of steam and was able to clean the grimiest messes with just a little bit of elbow grease. My first use was to scrub a kitchen floor that hadn't been scrubbed in over fifteen years. All it had known was a wet mopping once a week. Over the years, the dirt had embedded itself in the linoleum. With a little diluted bleach and the steam cleaner, the floor now sparkles. The glass enclosure on the shower sparkles as well.I am well satisfied with the performance of the steam cleaner. I just wish the handy smaller attachments lasted a little longer."
1,Waste of time,"This thing is a clumsy hassle to set up and use, but I thought it would be worth it because of the advertised qualities. Not so. The steam is barely warm and after less than 30 seconds all it does is sputter until I wait for it to heat up again. The wire brush type tool cleans just as well with a spray bottle of cold water and the tool hand held. I tried it on all kinds of surfaces, tile, tubs, windows, mirrors and saw nothing I couldn't do faster and better with a nylon scrubber and a little detergent at most. After being absolutely sure I wasn't missing anything in the instructions, I've come to the conclusion it is totally useless. My friend returned the unit she bought for the same reasons."
4,Super Star,"The McCulloch MC1275 is a time-saving, work cutting little machine. My husband was impressed when we first opened the box and he saw how sturdily built the MC1275 was. I previously had a hand held, rinky dink steamer which broke down after two cleanings attempts. With this machine we've stripped wax off of three floors, steamed cleaned two bathrooms, cleaned windows and the machine is still going strong. The MC1275 is about 2 - 3 times the price of other hand held steamers. But when you consider how ofen you have to add water to the little steamer, how small an area the hand held one is capable of cleaning at a time, how little the hand held can actually do before it breaks down (which it will) the MC1275 was well worth the price."
4,The Most Fun I've Had Cleaning - EVER!!!,"I originally saw a similar steamer advertised on TV, and then checked the web to get some background info and found that this steamer was rated higher than most others...so I bought it. I used it to clean the tiles in my shower, window blinds, tile and hardwood floors (all without the use of chemicals!!!)...And it was actually fun to use--I'm not kidding! It did a particularly beautiful job on the hardwood floors. Very easy to use and comes with a bunch of attachments (although the scrubber fell apart after the first use, it was quickly and easily replaced by manufacturer). You will, however, need to order extra terrycloth pads for floors as the one that comes with the steamer is just not enough for large/many floor surfaces. But they are very inexpensive. I would recommend this product to anyone--it just takes all of the smelly toxins and rigorous scrubbing out of housecleaning. Yay!!!"
3,McCulloch MC-1275 Heavy Duty Steam Cleaner,It does a good job. Not as easy to use as I hoped. I have never used a steam cleaner before. Maybe in time I will be happy with it. I don't like the window attachment left lost of streaks. It did preaty good on my gas range. also on my tolets.
2,Steams but does not clean,"I bought this unit for cleaning my motorcycle. The front of the engine and the areas under the seat and under the gas tank are hard to reach and clean. I was hoping the steam would soften and remove the debris. Well it steams as advertised but the dirt does not move. I tried it on the showers and the compressor area of an ice maker. Same story, lots of steam but not much cleaning. It just does not have enough pressure to do much more than put on a big steam show."
5,Great steamer,"I agree with the other reviews, this is a great steamer. Well builtand the steam lasts. We had a hand held steamer that was heavy to lugaround with water inside than tried the Monster which was too big tofit in close areas and left the floor sopping wet. Glad we found thisone."
2,mccoulloch steam cleaner,"I was very disappointed with the effeciency of this product. I bought it for house whole use. It is not powerful enough for what I intended to use it for, cleaning soap scum from fiberglass showers and glass shower doors. It still requied a lot of intense scrubbing. I probably will just do it by hand instead of dragging out the equipment and wasting time setting everything and then cleaning everything up for storage. I was really hoping this would be the answer to this task."
1,Does a horrbile job,"I followed all the instructions and this steamer did a horrible job after it was heated up to get any of the grime off my engine. I did a better job using the garden hose. I'm sure it will do a decent job on hard wood floors or tile, but if you need to clean anything like a grill or engine of a car, STAY AWAY."
1,Very disappointed,"It worked for first couple mins, then it lost power...i checked all plugs and read the instruction again, but nothing happened.Also, IMO the product name is misleading, the power is weak, not for heavy duty use at all.Very disappointed and its the first amazon item that i have to send it back."
2,Not worth the money,"This product did not work at all as advertised. The areas I needed it to clean, specifically the grout lines between the ceramic tiles are basically still dirty. A little of the dirt was removed, but not much. Same with the ceramic top stove. The burned on dirt DID NOT come off. Yes, it seems powerful, but mostly just steam coming out, no dirt being removed. This item is not worth the money! I'm sorry that I purchased it."
2,Does not get the dirt out,I bought it to use when detailing my car and for removing some dirt spots from the carpet. While I have not had the opportunity to use it on the car exterior I did use it on the carpet with little success.
3,Returned,This item was returned. It was not as expected when I tried the item at home. I will look for another style.
4,Home steam cleaner,"The cleaner is not bad for a cheap(in price,quality of this cleaner is very nice) home steam cleaner. Does the tile floors very nice,it cleans the grout between the tiles pretty good not great but good. It doesn't have great pressure for a steam cleaner,but for the price it does good.It only has about 23-25 psi compared to more expensive steam cleaners that produce 50 psi or more.In the bathroom the tile came out fantastic,you don't know how much overspray from hair spray you get,now the tile floor is smooth and shiny.In many spots on the tile floor you can see the difference in the tile if you do only half of it.You don't realize how dirty the floor is until you steam clean it.Not made for heavy duty cleaning like engines only for light cleaning. Would recommend it others for light home cleaning."
4,Will try as a replacement to my similar 4 year old Euro Pro,Had been using Euro Pro model like the McCulloch but the switch to turn it on went out. The EuroPro was impossible to take apart without specialized tools. The boiler still worked but could not switch the nozzle on to let out the steam. These units have specialized applications. They do not really sanitize although you could probably put a couple drops of bleach in the water. They work best cleaning nooks and crannies as found around sink faucets and toilets. They can can also be used to remove some tough stains from fabrics and carpets and clean jewelry and glasses. I used distilled water in mine. Watch out around latex painted surfaces such as bathroom walls (don't hold the nozzle too close). I love the units as long as you understand thierapplications are limited. I like the price of the McCulloch which was almost half of my old EuroPro and the quality looks at least on par.
2,Not sure why this thing is getting 5 stars,"I was a little reluctant to buy this cleaner at first because the reviews seemed to be so mixed. Now that I've used it a few times I have to say that it is pretty useless. I have not been able to remove anything of significance from anything. This includes grout, bathroom scum and stove grease among other things. In fact, whatever the steamer does remove can be easily taken off with a wet sponge. I give it 2 stars only because it is well built. However, the steam and temperature output are wholly insufficient to get much of anything done. I really have my doubts about the integrity and/or judgment of people who have given this product 5 stars."
1,not impressed,"This steamer is not what i thought it would be. When you use it it loses pressure right away so you have to sit and wait- pain in the ____ One of the brushes , the green scrubber, is attached with glue. This came off immediately and had to be thrown away , dumb design. The steamer cleans fairly well , but is very time consuming to fill, heat up, and wait forever for pressure to build."
4,Love this steamer,"This machine is very easy to use. The attachement go on and off very easily. It heats up in minutes. I love that it is on wheels it is much easier to do the floors with this machine than one without wheels. Extra long hose can reach all walls and ceilings. The only thing I don't like is the steam button when in the locked position will sometimes come out, but this is a small problem. This is a great little steamer to get those jobs done around the house. Do yourself a favor an order more of the pads to do the floors and walls."
5,Great Grout Cleaner,I have about 600 square feet of tile flooring and needed to get the grout cleaned. This unit easily got years of crud and dirt out with no problem. Grout looked new. Plenty of pressure. Good assortment of attachments. The fiber brush head seem to melt down and can't deal with heavy grime. the wire brush head and fiber pads are excellent. Easy access to after market accesooories and parts from manufacturer.
4,R. Smith,"I've had the unit for over a year and it performs well. The plastic nozzles are the weak point, they don't hold up well and should be made of metal or a stronger plastic. This is not a fast and easy tool if you want something done in under 5 minutes but it leaves no chemical residue and that is a definite plus. I used it on old baked in kitchen residue and it did get through it down to the metal and that is a plus on a 20 year old stove. That is saying a lot when the chemicals had trouble with it. I like the sterilized results it provides. I also like the variety of tasks it can handle with such things as cleaning the car of grit from salt in a Chicago winter. The steam warms the garage even in freezing weather making the task bearable. I do like the water capacity of the unit and didn't have to refill it for half an hour when full."
1,Not well made,I bought this steam cleaner to mop my floors.The mop head broke the 2nd time I used it. The head wouldn't stay attached to the pole. Then the handle snapped in half. In addition the lock to hold the steam on fails every 20 seconds.
4,McCulloch MC 1275 Steam Cleaner,"I selected the McCulloch MC 1275 after reading several reviews on it. I was interested in a steam cleaners ability to clean tile and grout and, price-wise, the MC 1275 received good marks in this department. Upon receiving the steam cleaner I read the instructions and put it to work. Using the small brushes to clean grout required getting down on your hands and knees. It worked very well and produced immediate results. Some areas required a second cleaning but overall I was very pleased with the cleaning ability of the MC-1275. I have also used it to clean the tile floors using the micro-fiber pad and this also worked very well. With a full tank of water the cleaner takes about 10 minutes to heat the water but this gave me about 40 minutes of cleaning. I have hesitated using the cleaner on my laminate wood floors as I feel that it still puts too much moisture down and do not want to risk damage."
3,Clean Betty,I like the cleaner but it is a little to big to carry around. I used it on my tiles in the bathroom and on by tile floor. I wish it was conpacted to store.
4,Good Steamer,"I bought this after looking at many reviews of various home steamers. For the price and size, it does a good job. I have done my kitchen tile grout, baseboards, and numerous things. It gives a good amount of steam, it cord reaches quite a distance. Over all I feel this was a good buy for a home steamer. It will well pay for itself just after a few uses. I use it at least once a week and have not been disappointed yet."
4,Great floor steam cleaner,"I have mainly used it for cleaning my tile floor and it does a great job. There was a lot of residue left from my prior floor cleaning produce and after the second cleaning the tile really looks brand new. I tried the attachments to clean some hard water build up on my shower floor and it ,didn't really help, however it did clean the grime off of my stove top. I am eally happy I bought it."
2,Pads,I purchased your steamer and it works great on some things. The only problem I have is the type of pad it comes with. I steamed my ceramic floors with it several times and thought they were cleam but I went over them with another brand steamer and the pads were filthy. Your pads didn't pick up any dirt at all. I suggest you supply a different type of pad.
3,not too shabby,I love the fact that you can steam for almost an hour nonstop.. i use it to sanitize dog kennels and steam the floors.. 'the only thing i didn't like is the attachment parts were not made very well.. they melted easily
1,NOT TOO THRILLED,"I purchased this steamer primary to use on my shower doors and BBQ grill. I soon learned that it is not as easy as on those ""Seen on TV"". This particular steamer comes with some brush attachments. The heat created from the steam will melt the plastic bristles. I used it once and decided that cleaners and chemicals work MUCH better!!"
1,Can't find anything it will actually clean??,"I had high hopes for this machine.. Use in the bathroom, steam clean the wheels on my car. Unit seems to be very well made. One ""slight"" problem is that it simply does not clean anything. This is not an exaggeration.. It does not clean anything! My suggestion, don't waste your money or time on this."
4,A Good Head of Steam,"It has done a very good job with cleaning stained grout on the tile floor, removing stains from carpet, and even helped me remove wallpaper."
3,"Not the ""heavy duty"" product it professes to be.","It is good for light cleaning, but nothing heavy. The scrubbing brushes that came with it are useless...made of nylon & become like cooked pasta when exposed to the steam.The steam spray is a very small, focused stream that cleans only a very small area at a time.Amount of steam time for use is limited..water tank allows 15 minutes worth of steam at a time, with a minimum of 10 minutes wait time to re-fill the water tank.Mine did not have the squeegee that it was supposed to have, so I do not know how or how well it works.The machine cleans the floor well, but leaves it VERY wet.I would not purchase this item knowing what I now know, but will use it for small cleaning jobs."
3,It's Okay,"I guess I was expecting dirt and such to melt away as shown on the TV commercials. I've found out steam doesn't work like that. It took a lot of steam to clean up the kitchen floor that had gotten dirty from mud, grease, etc. It is a great product, just not what I expected as far as using steam to clean with."
2,not much useful,"Don't expect too much from this machine. With the nozzles included you can not do anything beyond scrub or mop floor. Also the water tank is very small, you have to keep adding water."
1,Doesn't work like it should!,"This is a new product, never worked well. The little light indicator goes on and off all the time. You don't get continuous steam at all. We are very disappointed. I'm trying to locate a phone number for customer service, no one picks up the phone. I need to return this unit and get a reimbursement..."
2,Unhappy,"Once the product was recieved I was anxious to put it to use. After following directions, steam cleaner did not perform as I had hoped and was advertised. Unable to remove even light calcium deposits from not shower tile or some mold spots. Would not recommend purchase.Pete Capparelli, Idyllwild, CA"
1,gaynor reynolds,not happy with purchase and returned machinedid not work as well as hoped fortook a long time to clean. dripped and emptied faster than i would have like also no handle to move the machine around ?....felt like it was being dragged into place
3,"UPDATE-VERY NICE FOR NUMEROUS APPLICATIONS, BUT.........","This steamer appears to be of fairly decent quality, however after using it several times, the overpowering acrid odor it produced really laid me low. It caused irritation to my throat and nasal membranes. There is some consolation knowing that I may be covered under the new national health plan!After calling the manufacturer and finding that they apparently never had this problem before, (yeah, right!) they were nice enough to suggest sending it back for repair or to Amazon for replacement or refund.A DAY LATER I RECONTACTED MFR.AND LEARNED THE BOILER IS MADE OF HARD PLASTIC!Who knows what possibly lethal chemicals go into the making of hard plastic boilers from China!Needless to say, this MC-1275 is on its way back to Amazon."
1,McCulloch Steam Cleaner - product defective,"McCulloch MC1275 Steam Cleaner. I received this product almost immediately - shipping was very fast. The product was packed very well - every part was individually wrapped and secured within the box. Unfortunately I never got a chance to use it. You have to assemble the handle on top - which holds the hand piece and is the only means for lifting the cleaner to move it around. However, the handle could not be affixed according to the instructions. The holes for the screws and the screws were out of alignment and there was no way to force them into place without causing more damage. I returned the product the next day."
2,had to return it for not being hot enough!,"Maybe I had a defective one, or maybe it's just a generally faulty product- but it did not get hot enough to generate a good steam. No pressure and a low temperature. Followed the instructions with waiting for the light and ended up with some unimpressive steam (we could hold our hands near the steam, definitely not hot!) and puddles of water on our surfaces. Tried it on the wood floors, tile floors, the bathtub, and marble counters- didn't clean anything that I couldn't do with a scrub sponge. Called the company and they accepted the return without an hassle. But it's definitely a well designed and sturdy product, so if you get one that works I imagine it would be great!"
3,Hmmm,"what can i say...it is good for those little type jobs...doesn't do anything for a tile floor but it did work on removing wallpaper...but it was slow going...had to keep stopping to add water and heat back up....if i knew how it worked from the start, i don't think i would've bought it"
4,Powerful,"I have had smaller steam cleaners in the past so the power this one gives is so much more so that I can keep cleaning for a long time. Love the micro-fabric attachment came with this - it clings to the bottom of this mop and stays there. Compare to other micro-fabric I used before, this one picked up less dust but hoping it is doing its job.Only problem I have with this is that it spills a lot water at beginning before steam comes out so if you don't want to wet the surface that you are working on, you need a bucket to collect the water. Other than that, love it so far and planning on using it to clean patio door railing next among my to-clean-list."
3,"was broken after 3 days, but customer service excellent","I bought this product a week ago to fight bed bugs, it works ok for 3 days and then stopped working. The power light stopped turning on when switched on. I called the company and they were very professional, promised to send a new one right away, still waiting for it. Overall a reasonable product for the price. I hope the new one will work fine this time. Customers service was excellent I must say; Never seen anything like that.Marie"
3,Sort of Handy,"I was looking to use this primarily to clean grout lines that had become very dirty. I saw a video on a tile cleaning website that demonstrated how this machine easily cleaned the grout. It was a bit misleading as the dirt did not give up so easily, but I must admit that I did manage to get the grout clean AFTER scrubbing it with a degreaser and then using the steamer. I am satisfied with the end result, but I can not say that this machine made it effortless."
1,Not heavy duty,"I got this steam cleaner in the hopes it would get some built up grease off old kitchen cabinets. Did not impress me at all. Did not work on the grease. Tried it on my oven door, nothing. I guess if you have light grease or dirt that you don't want to wipe off with a paper towel or dish sponge, this unit might be for you. Luckily I will be able to return it."
2,Steam cleaner,"This unit probably does what is advertised, but it didn't clean the bathroom grout like I expected. I used various brushs, oxiclean and even acid cleaner. Then I bought the steam cleaner and it didn't do any better. After an hour working on about 20 inches of grout around the toillet, there was little or no improvement in removing the dark stains. This product may have some use but it doesn't clean grout."
1,Bummer!,"I was waiting with bated breath for my steamer as I have a lot of deep Spring cleaning I want to tackle. I filled it with water, turned it on, waited for the light to go off and pressed the trigger button. Nothing happened. I called Steamfast and the customer service guy (Harold) had me try several things, but in the end nothing got the trigger working. He told me my unit was not functioning properly and asked for the serial #, etc. He then informed me that if I could cut off the cord and email him a picture of the cordless unit, he would send me a replacement. I tried cutting the cord and couldn't and I don't have a digital camera. So here I am. Bummed."
1,McCulloch - 1275,"I hated this product. I am returning it because it is not hot enough and it spits water. I tried it on soap scum, toilet rust, water sediment around the sink and it did not clean any of them. It was very loud; it actually hurt my ears and impaired my hearing for a few hours after using it. I don't even give this product a star rating, because it doesn't even rate one star. Funny, this page would not let me submit my response without giving it at least one star so I must, but only because I have to."
3,Attachments.,"Its a powerful steamer and does do the job. However, the brushes and other attachments tend to break-up because of the heat. Be prepared to buy attachments like brushes etc. The company suggests to use their products only and I find that these add on's are expensive to buy when one takes into account shipping charges."
2,"Terrific idea, tho doubt it gets hot enough","I like the compactness of this device, and used it to clean bathroom fixtures. Tried it on grout, and not happy, as did not remove stains or mildew in corners. The steam of course turns to water, so I find that it requires additional labor of wiping and drying. I bought a thermometer to test the temperature of the steam and it did not reach high enough to sterilize. I did web research and find that certain high temps sterilize while lower ones fail. This fails. I used it a half dozen times in the kitchen on sink and stovetop, in all cases finding it inadequate to the tasks. The only thing it did superlatively well: wet the caked mud on my shoes and blow it away."
5,Very Pleased.....,"The outside of our house was under construction for several months so our dog tracked in mud everywhere, especially the tile kitchen. I spent over $100 on different types of cleaners but nothing was working. I thought I was going to have to replace the entire floor until a friend told me to try a steam cleaner. I found several and compared prices/features and decided this was the one for my project and budget. It was HARD work - two 4 hour days but I got my tile floor looking brand new and back to the original grout color (beige). I was impressed and so was my family members who told me to give up."
1,the other reviewers must be McCulloch employees,"I do not understand all the rave reviews for this steam cleaner. It makes a deafening sound when in use, does a poor job cleaning my tub, sink, and bathroom tile. I purchased this item 3 months ago and wanted to give it a fair assesment and experiment with all the different attachments and I can safely say this was a complete waste of money. Good for virtually nothing. Maybe i can get 5 or 10$ for it at a garage sale next summer."
3,Selective uses,"I've had my Mccollouch steamer about two years now. It is great for stripping old caulk, too messy to clean walls or the stove. That makes it a rather expensive caulk cleaner. I am still trying to figure out how to use it to clean my carpet but with all the water, I probably won't."
4,Excellent but not quite.,"This unit is my second steam cleaner. It's much more powerfull than the old one (and it was great). However, the descrtiption says ""a steam-control switch provides control over the amount of steam coming from the unit"". There is no such control. The unit puts out so much steam there is a bit of water sputtering in there too. Otherwise -- this is top notch! I love the huge capacity."
4,Works well on most surfaces,"It works well for cleaning stuff like bathrooms and refrigerator/freezer messes. Deep soap scum or a neglected grill grate will take some effort. (Buy a new grate but the shower looked new after an hour of steam cleaning). The unit holds a lot of water so you don't have to refill it every 5 minutes. Its very loud. Also, you can get about 45 seconds of (effective) steam before it has to reheat for 30 seconds or so. So you end up steaming for a little bit, then wiping up, and waiting for the signal the temperature is right again. All in all Im happy with it but its not quite the magical machine I was hoping for."
3,"The steam is good, but...","Ok, I bought the machine based on so many reviews at amazon.I have to say the mc-1275 is the best steam cleaner in the market. Great design, long operation time.But I found out the steam itself cannot make cleaning easier than soup and scrub.And I think the easy cleaning result on TV only because their ""grease"" is not as tough as my home."
4,Not as great as I had hoped.,I bought this machine for my tile grout. It didn't do such a good job. But I did find other uses for it. I can clean the washing machine rim and in the nooks and crannys. It does blow stuff out of the cracks in things. The steam has not got the force it claims but I do like the machine. It does window pretty well too. I was also able to clean the inside of my fridge. I don't like using chemicals in there. With this machine no need for harsh chemicals.
3,Steamer review,"This is the second McCulloch Steamer that I have purchased and I have to say that this one has been cheapened up a LOT! The plastic holder will not stay in the slot, and the hose cannot be interchanged with other steamers (which is why I purchased another one in the first place). I'm very dissappointed in McCulloch, but I love the steamer machines. They make my cleaning so much easier!"
2,McCulloch MC-1275 Heavy Duty Steam Cleaner,Nice size unit. Does have good steam. Steam is not hot enough to remove the dirt as promised. Not as good a deal as I had hoped.
1,Not impressed!,Thought this would be an easy way to clean....I will be going back to chemicals.....too much work for very little. The pad came apart due to the heat and moisture.
3,Good for smaller jobs,"Simple to operate, comes with good instructions, and easy to use.I bought it to clean oil and grease off of a car engine and under carriage.You probably need something more powerful if the ""gunk"" is pretty well set.It didn't work that well for me on a car engine and brake parts."
4,"Great, especially for the price","I got this unit to replace an old SHARK Professional Steam Cleaner that had a great floor attachment, but the pressure sensor went out (replacement not available). The MC1275 comes with a floor wand but you cannot attach small towels like the Shark wand (you have to use their pads which don't hold very well). I ended up ""adapting"" the floor atachment to avoid using the MAC pads.This unit holds plenty of water, is stable, has a nice long cord, and does more than my old unit. Make sure you run some vinegar or descaler thru it once in a while if you've got mineralized/well water to keep the unit heating properly.All in all, I'm very satisfied with the MC-1275."
1,Disappointment,Not at all happy with this item. Have not found any job that this has made easier to do. Would not recommend.
4,steame cleaner,I love this product! I use it for work and at home. It takes the hard work out of cleaning!The steamer comes with lots of attachments that allow you to be able to clean a variety of things! making this a great product.
1,McCulloch MC-1275 Heavy-Duty Steam Cleaner,"Not as heavy duty as they claim! After cleaning the grout around two four inch tiles on the bathroom vanity it ran out of steam. I kept having to wait for it to build up another head of steam. For the most part it just delivered a lot of hot air. Looks like a nice quality unit, but just doesn't perform as claimed. I sent it back right away & Amazon gave me a full refund, & paid the shipping both ways!"
4,Good value,"Lots of pressure, very portable and useful attachments, and runs a long time when the tank is topped. This is replacing a Fantom unit I liked better only because it had a large scrub brush attachment that was handy for toilet cleaning plus it had a pressure gauge."
2,Not what I expected,"The ad for this steamer shows grease being cleaned off a car engine. It doesn't even take dust off my blinds. So far I tried it on blinds, bird cages, and shower and was not impressed. While it may help loosen dirt, nothing beats old fashion elbow grease. I'm sure it would take wrinkles out of drapes and clothes, but that's about it."
5,This machine made cleaning fun.,"I've wanted a steam cleaner for several years, but they all seemed too expensive. Finally, I bought this McCulloch MC-1275 Heavy-Duty Steam Cleaner. Within minutes, a powerful steam jet is at my command. Wow, it really cleaned the refrigerator, and the freezer. It seemed so fun, my husband says I would make a good commercial. I bought two more to give as Christmas gifts, and Mom says Dad is home cleaning the base boards."
4,Good in grout cleaning,"It is loud as most people stated. Better wear ear plugs. It works fine on grouts, but you do need to use a brush or something to scrub them. Use some vinger also helps to clean the grouts."
2,Works Well BUT,"The unit itself works well, however I don't find steam cleaning all that great.It did not clean the grot in our shower and is a lot of work to use."
4,Steaming right along,I've always heard that steam cleaning was the way to go and this little machine proved it. It has multiple attachments for various types of jobs. I did find it hard to clean the tub & tile area. I haven't tried it on the windows yet. My opinion on the floors is thumbs up. Great!
4,Works great,"I've always been skeptical of steam cleaners, mostly because they are advertised on infomercials. Good price for this and people seemed to give it good reviews, so I bought it.I admit for some things it isn't as easy as using a towel and cleaner, but it is chemical free. The most impressive thing this has done for me is deal with the rough grout on my tiling which encases my tub. I had tried many different ways of cleaning it and they never did that great of a job. The texture was just too rough. Now after using this, it's so amazingly clean. I didn't feel bad about having company use that room anymore.I wish there was a more versatile head. Getting behind faucets and tight areas isn't always the easiest and sometimes just pain impossible. A fine point head would be helpful too.Overall this product is great. I don't regret buying it one bit and delivery was great and well protected."
5,"Steamer is more than I expected, very pleased!","I have used it for many different uses, and can confirm that it exceeded my expectations. Easy to use, and look forward to more tasks to test it on."
2,Not what I expected,"I have well water that is very hard and leaves rings on my commodes and hard water stains on all the faucets. I was hoping the steam would clean my shower doors, commodes and tubs but that did not happen. I got it as a Christmas present and have not used it but twice. Hope I can find some use for it."
4,Great cleaning gadget,Removed wax build up from ceramic tile floor that we thought we needed to replace. Worked as advertised. Will try for different applications in the future.
2,Poor to Mediocre Performance,"This steamer does a good job on lightly stained surfaces, but don't expect it to be the ""wonder drug"" of household cleaners. I have used the steamer only in a shower, and I have to say that Tilex and Comet work much better than the steamer. Forget about this thing removing any soap scum.The steam coming out the end of the nozzle cools enough that I can hold my hand in the stream about an inch from the nozzle. I have used several of the wired and plastic brushes, plus the scouring pads included with the steamer, but I have to say that a little elbow grease and some standard household products do a better job than this steamer."
3,alright,"It works alright, but it takes 15 mins to warm up, I would use it if I have a lot to clean, not good for quick clean up."
2,NOT THE BEST/NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,"I expected this to clean the grout in our bathroom.I scubbed tru two pads and the dirt is still there!!!Our shower was clean before,I just wanted it to work on the grout and the shower doors.It did remove the mold from the deck railing,and it did remove a stain from a chair.There is not enough steam,and it does not last long enough.It is built well,I am puzzled why it did get such good reviews???I have read the reviews several times looking for hints.I guess I was expecting more."
1,Don't get fooled.,"I would like to find and kick the guy who wrote this for the product description'Ideal for cleaning and detailing cars, trucks, motorcycles, or boats, the cleaner removes stains and odors from upholstery, carpeting, and floor mats, as well as grease and grime from engines, wheels, and chrome accessories.'I bought this steam cleaner to clean my motorcycle. My motorcycle has some grease and dirt build-ups around the engine. I was shooting steam at a single spot for 5 minutes and this steamer didn't do a thing.Simple degreaser and a brush did the wonder.Do not buy this product for the purpose of vehicle cleaning/detailing."
3,"Bulky, doesn't do what I'd hoped",It comes with many attachments which is good but it doesn't seem to really clean anything. There is allot of sputtering but it did not cut through the grease in the Oven nor did it do much in the tub. It's big and hard to store. The cord does not contract which is a pain. I don't think I would recommend it if you are looking for something to really get the dirt out and disinfect.
5,great!!!!!!,"i ordered this to clean my apartment when i moved out. it made a difficult job so easy. it cleaned everything from appliancesto floors flawlessly. went for at least 2 hours without refilling. then my husband discovered it. it did car wheels,seats etc. thank you mcculloch"
5,The best buy around,"I had to clean a stove top that renters didn't clean for the 2 years they lived in the house. I thought I would have to throw the stove away. My son purchased the steam cleaner,after I saw how it cleaned his home and how easy it took care of his cleaning needs I purchased mine. The stove top looks brand new and cleaned up so quickly. I would recommend this to everyone who wants to take the hard out of work. I love this steamer ! It is beyond great. Thank you for a great machine and even better the price is a real bargin"
3,Gets the job done,"Pretty good product for the home gets the job done in cleaning aground the house, a bit of leaks from the bottom of unit and the wand when stopping the steam job. Some of the plastic brushes are useless after the first use poor quality brushes.For the price it's an ok product."
4,Over all very good!,The steamer works really well. The only thing I see wrong is that the nylon brushes don't really last. I can see myself replacing them for every job. I think they should be made of something a little more substancial. I have recomanded it to my family.Mary
4,average,It does not get very hot for a steam cleaner and it runs out of steam rather quickly. Will try a different brand next time.
3,Don't leave water in it,"This steamer worked great in hard to reach places in the bathroom, inside the fridge, stovetop, windows, shower, faucets etc. It didn't necessarily cut cleaning time - in fact it increased it but I was cleaning everything in sight and all looked great until.....I came back from vacation and filled it up with water. In a minute I had a puddle of red (rust colored) water pooling under the unit. I have not used it since. The only thing I can think of is that I must have left water in the unit for the 2 weeks I was gone and it rusted the unit out and the rust must have eaten through something. So don't leave water in it or you'll end up like me. It's unfortunate that short of turning the (somewhat heavy) unit upside down and shaking it, there is no way to drain unused water (like the plug at the bottom of a cooler). I loved how it cleaned but think I'll try another portable steamer this time around."
2,Loved it while it lasted,"I bought this steam cleaner in dec 2010 and now 2 years later, it does not even urn on. I was careful to read all the reviews to make an educated decision on hich steam mahine to buy, and so needless to say, I am very disappointed that mine did not last for 2 years. It did work well when it did work though. I did everything right (followed the manuel exactly) and used it maybe every 6 weeks to clean my home so it is not like it was excessively used or abused. One day it just stopped working and would not even power on. And of course the warrenty was up.... Very disappointed. Would not recommend at all."
3,Its the Steam not the Steamer.,"It is as all have said, well made...etc. etc.I find that Steam is not as useful as you would think.It is not the machine as much as ""Steam"" it just does too small ofan area to be efficient, you will be much more productive withgood old warm water a little bleach and some elbow grease.sorry no easy way out here."
4,great for the price.,It works on lighter stains but not on tough one. Don't expect miracles! But it cleans lighter stains without any chemical use. I tried other similar units in the same price range and this unit had more power and more attachments. It is very easy to use also.
4,Love my steamer!!!,"I have been looking for a steamer, heavy duty for cleaning around the house. I read the reviews and all seemed good so I thought I would give it a try. The steamer is wonderful, heavy duty, steams forever but I have one complaint. The attachments that come along for cleaning melt, the bristles melt with the amount of steam that comes out. Other than that, great steamer, great price, don't hesitate."
3,McCulloch Steam Cleaner,"Bought the steam cleaner to clean soap scum in bathtub but did not work too well. It doesn't clean tire rims too good either.I felt that the only thing it did do well was floors, tried it on tile and laminate floorsAnd did both equally well."
4,Steam ceaner,Pro I really like the steamer and agree that it does hold allot of water compared to the sharp steamerCons There are no replacement pads for the floor!!!!!!!!! Cannot locate any on the web :-)
4,Love it-my favorite so far!,"I have only had the steam cleaner a couple months but I have had two other similar but different-brand steam cleaners in the past & this one is the best so far. The other two brands were both around $130 & I paid $88 for this one and it seems to be a better quality. The 1st week I cleaned all the bathroom tile showers & floors, faucets & showerheads, toilets & sinks. Also cleaned the living room tile floors, kitchen linoleuum, wood floors, some windows, sliding door track, two refridgerators & freezers and a BBQ grill. The only con is that one of the little plastic brush attachments did not hold up well, but as a whole I am very pleased. The other two did not last a year so I am hoping this will last at least that long as it has made cleaning & my life so much easier. If I have to buy one every year I will!"
5,it made my life easier,"heavy scrubbing is not easy to do with a mild disability. the mcculloch mc-1275 heavy duty steam cleaner made my life cleaner, safer and easier. i can reach and clean areas i have not been able to clean for a long time. it is safe, without using cleaners, for my pets and me. i use it on my every day cleaning needs, floors, windows, grout, bathroom, appliances, also to sanitize and deoderize furniture. i read other reviews before i bought it and knew what to expect. i would reccommend only one thing. don't steam floors wearing flip flops. otherwise i do love using my steam cleaner."
5,Love this Steamer!,"I spent a great deal of time researching different steamers and listening to the the reviews people wrote about them. I have allergies to mold, mildews and dust mites. This seems to be the overall favorite for those who want a quality project without great cost and it is recommended by several allergy websites. This steamer works extremely well and I have noticed a difference in my house already. It is lightweight and very portable. There are attachments for any job you can think of. The hose is long ehough to reach just about anywhere. I have not noticed a problem with the steam output at all. Be realistic - If you are looking for a unit which is going to peel the paint off your wall then spend the $1000-$3000 for the bigger more industial units. This is a powerful small unit with quality attachments and only for around a $100. It has plenty of power to tackle just about any job. I love this steamer. It is perfect for sanitizing and cleaning any area of your home."
4,Good little steam cleaner!,"I am using mine mainly for bathroom tile cleaning and floor cleaning. I loved how it worked on my bathroom tile, especially the floor. However, I did get a bit overzealous with one of the scrub brushes and wound up somewhat melting it and warping it, luckily there are plenty provided. On my laminate floor, it cleaned well but not as well as I had hoped, so for that purpose I'd say, ""meh, it does the job."" I do wish the accessory bin was a bit larger or there were a way to attach the larger accessories (the nozzle, the floor cleaner, etc.) to the actual device just for convenience and quick availability. Overall, I think it this was a good purchase."
4,Good steamer,"I am very happy with this purchase. I used it to remove old wallpaper and what a difference it made! The hose is really long, so there was no problem steaming wallpaper above my head. It is lightweight, so for wallpaper above my cabinets, I simply set the steamer on my counter (blocking the wheels with a rolled towel so it wouldn't roll off). One thing you should know, is that if you let the steamer sit for too long between releasing the steam through the nozzle, water will spray out. It was fine to sit while I scraped the wallpaper just steamed. But once, I left it to answer the door and was delayed about 10 minutes. When I steamed next, too much water came out and I had to clean up a bit. After that, if I thought I was going to be delayed, I simply unplugged it and allowed it to warm up again when I was ready to return to the project. Using it for the wallpaper removal, the steam lasted about 50 minutes before needing to refill."
5,Steamey,great product....just moved into this farmhouse and it was extremely dirty. I am so glad I bought this product....it was well worth the money...I love it
3,Mcculloch Steam cleaner,"Better than a mop on marble floor surface, but doesn't clean grout as well as we expected.I can see the hose eventually failing where it is permanently attached to the body of the machine, and when this happens, the unit is no longer usable. A company rep confirmed that this would be the case!"
3,"Good price, less than great life.","Pros for this steamer: very effective for a steamer in this price range. Great on grout. Replacement brushes and attachments are very reasonably priced.Cons:My steamer stopped working after only 10 months. Fortunately, it is still under warranty, but I find it to be a hassle to have to send it back to have it fixed after such a short time. Also, the brushes are not very sturdy and need to be replaced often."
5,works very well,I purchased this to remove salt stains from my carpeting in the truck that I drive thruout the winter months here is Buffalo NY and it works very well
2,Did not clean grout,"I was pleased when I received the steamer. It is sturdy, produced the requisite steam, and is easy to use. Unfortunately it did not make any appreciable difference when I used it on soiled grout. The primary reason I purchased this item was to clean grout since my house is tiled instead of carpeted so I ended up returning it for a refund. As always, Amazon made the return easy."
3,McCulloch Bug Steam Cleaner,"I am quite pleased with the performance of this steam cleaner. Easy to fill and prep, heats quickly. The one negative would be - lack of a caddy for all the various attachments."
4,loved it,"works pretty good. but wont get the tile grout completely clean (as in looking new)but it does look alot better. i think you would need a commercial grout and tile cleaner for that. but i am very pleased with it. lasts about 50 minutes before you have to fill it up with water again. after i use the grout scrubber, i go over my entire floor with my floor mate."
5,Absolutely Amazing,"Very effective in removing all kinds of embedded dust, dirt and grime. Used it in my kitchen, bathrooms and to clean all areas of my house. Am in love with it."
2,Disappointing,"The steamer was not able to generate much pressure. The pressure is needed to help dissolve the grease on oven doors and stove tops. It's only useful for lightweight cleaning, which I could accomplish with a microfiber cloth and some warm water."
3,Decent quality but doesn't live up to expectations,"I bought this steam cleaner exclusively to clean the nasty brown mold growing in between the tiles in my shower. I've seen countless videos showing these things effortlessly cleaning shower gunk worse than what I have. However, to my amazement this device can't even make a dent in it. I tried for over 20 minutes to clean a tiny spot about 2 inches long and got nowhere. I tried various attachments to no avail. I was also amazed to watch as it instantly melts its own nylon brushes. After over an hour messing around with it I finally threw in the towel.This thing definitely delivers serious steam and can be effective at cleaning a multitude of things with its various attachments. Just don't be duped by the demos you may see out there."
2,Really not for whole house cleaning,Purchased the McCulloch MC-1275 Heavy-Duty Steam Cleaner after my old Eureka tank system of 15 years died. This unit is really not designed for home use and it lasted only 6 months before it stopped. All attempts to get it looked at were in vain and we were unable to get steam to come out although the tank was quite hot.
3,I was sooo excited!,"I couldn't wait to get my hands on this and get down to some serious cleaning. The first time I used the mop the handle broke off from the mop head before I could finish the floor. I have a shark steam cleaner for my floors that I've used for about a year and have had no problems, I just thought this would be hotter and do an even better job. It might have had the handle not broken. I still use it for bathrooms, car detailing, kitchen etc. it works great. Love the bigger tank, fast heat up and powerful steam. I don't know who to contact about the handle and I'd love it if it had a garment attachment. For $100 if I can get the handle replaced I'll still be happy."
2,Save your money,"Yes, it steams, but the steam is like your tea pot, there is not enough pressure behind it to do anything. It works, some what, but I could have done just as good of a job with a degreaser and brush."
4,McCulloch Steamer Cleaner does the job!,"After hearing my daughter rave about this steam cleaner, to the point that she was willing to bring it to Portland on the train(!) so that I could use it, I decided to go ahead and just get one of my own. I have used it cleaning the ""impossible bathroom"" to an impressive degree - I was able to clean awkward spots that I hadn't been able to reach effectively with a sponge or scrub brush before. I don't think this room has ever been this clean since we bought the house. The less drastically dirty bathroom cleaned up very nicely, and I am looking forward to cleaning the rest of the house for a solid spring cleaning. My only problem was with the scouring pad attachment coming unglued from its plastic base after about ten minutes of use. Still usable, but took more care to keep it in place. I recommend this product wholeheartely!"
3,exaclty the same as Wagner,"I bought the wagner 905- It worked pretty well for a small machine, but the accessories (brushes, window cleaner etc) started to come apart. I decided to send it back and buy the McCulloch MC-1275 Heavy-Duty Steam Cleaner which was a little bit more expensive- When I opened the MuCulloch, guess what???It is EXACTLY the same machine as the Wagner, just a different label on it!! They are probably made by the same company in China and they just brand them differently. Too soon to tell if the accessories are as crappy, but I wam not confident!!"
4,Excellent Little Machine,"I bought this to clean up an apartment I was about to move into that was in dreadful shape. I can't believe what a great job it did on kitchen and bathroom surfaces I thought would never come clean.I used it on the unpolished hardwood floor just to get it sanitary but wouldn't recommend that if you have waxed or finished hardwood.Warning--it is addictive as prior reviews mention. So if you are a little OCD when it comes to cleaning, prepare yourself!"
1,Poor for shower soap scum,"I purchased the McCulloch MC-1275 to do battle with shower soap scum. The scum won. The steam softened the soap scum but did not remove it, so I ended up having to use the usual chemical cleaners, scrubbing pads, and razor blades.Though the McCulloch is very well built and has high-quality attachments, the steam cycled on and off too rapidly. The steam would last perhaps 30 to 60 seconds, then pause for 2 or 3 minutes until more steam could be produced. Customer service told me the ""boiler was not functioning properly"" and the unit could be brought in for repair. I chose to return the unit, which Amazon.com took care of very quickly and efficiently."
2,Save your money! Trust me!,"Expecting this to clean your tub or remove soap scum? If so, don't waste your time or money. I've tried cleaning just about everything (shower, toilet, build-up around the sink, fingerprints on stainless steel trashcan.....) in my house with this thing, and the only success found was in the microwave. If you use hot water on a rag, it works just as well. It will not blast away grime like you are expecting it to. If you want to spend $100+ to clean your microwave every few months, then this is the machine for you. Otherwise, just do as you've been doing and spend a few dollars a month on the cleaners that you'll have to end up buying when you realize what a disappointment this is."
1,Lots of steam!,"This item is great if steam what you are looking for. But if you want to use it for cleaning, be prepared to use a lot of elbow grease along with it. Does nothing ordinary soap, water and detergent couldn't do."
4,Awesome,We are truly amazed how well this machine works.In alot of the reviews it mentioned how obnoxious the sound was when they would be using the steam. Disagree...it wasnt that loud or high pitched.The first task we did for our preview of the equipment was tile great. It was fantastic how it cleaned.This steamer was recommended to me and I was hesitant to make the purchase now I am a believer.The only draw back is replacement heads (brass & nylon) are hard to locate. Then once I did find a site they were out of stock.ENJOY
1,Not reliable,"We have purchased 2 of these steamers in the past 5 months.The first time the bottom main mop head broke off from the wand. The second steamer, mid cleaning the handle broke off the wand and shot steam out from the top of the wand which ended up burning my wrist pretty badly.You could see the plastic where the pieces were to be attached just melted from the heat. So it just kept breaking.When it did work it would barely steam and just pour out water from the mop head. Took forever to heat up as well.Do not recommend this steamer to anyone! Piece of junk. Save yourself From injury and some money!"
5,Works on tough jobs!,"I bought this cleaner after debating between this and the typical carpet deep cleaners. My daughter threw-up in our new car so I needed something pretty powerful. I was not disappointed! I was so excited to watch the steam take out the stains AND the smell! And, I didn't have to pay a fortune for cleaning solutions. This is a must-have for anyone who might possibly have something to clean close by. Easy to use, very portable, and works better than expected!"
1,"Sleek design, but does not work","The machine is well built and is light weight enough to carry around. However, this machine does not create the power or steam to clean anything. I returned mine to Amazon after the first use."
3,Light Duty Cleaner,"I purchased this product with many high hopes. I have cleaned 2 bathrooms, a foyer, and a kitchen. In the bathrooms I had to get out some cleaning supplies to use in conjuction with it. When I did that it helped loosen the soap scum, but by itself it was taking FOREVER. It did a wonderful job cleaning the tile in the foyer, but I was hoping it would serve most of its helpfulness in the bathroom. I am not sorely disappointed but I am not overjoyed either. I am going to use it in a few weeks to assist me in cleaning some outdoor furniture. I hope it works like I think it will. I did not run out of steam while I was cleaning. I wish it had a compartment to hold all the attachments, right now they are in a wal-mart bag."
1,Junk!,"Made of cheap plastic, broke the first time I used it! Seems that there are some stress points that really should be made of metal."
3,great product,Awesome time saver.windows floors grout couch all in a couple hours. 3 stars because floor attachment head broke on second use.not sure if they will replace it.
3,Steam cleaner,"I purchased my steam cleaner and went on a cleaning spree! It was a labor of love. I enjoyed cleaning like never before. It even removed wallpaper from my bathroom walls before dying on me in 13 months. I was so sad because it worked well for a little steamer. However, the cost of replacing it every year did not outweigh the joy of cleaning. I am still looking for an inexpensive cleaner that works good. It is hard to invest lots of money in a steamer that I am not sure will perform and last as long as it says it will unless someone actually proves it to me. Oh well, it was good while it lasted."
4,Wonderful steam cleaner,"Have only had the McCulloch steamer a short time, but am very pleased. I have tried it on a lot of surfaces in my home. Bathroom tile, windows, painted walls, and varnished wood work. It works on it all. I have even taken bumper stickers off of a vehicle. I wish that it had a smaller pad for cleaning walls but the big one works well. I have recommended this product to all my friends."
3,Not as expected!,I honestly expected more power from this machine. Not as powerful in terms of build up pressure or heat. If you want to clean something. You better of getting some detergent or any of those cleaning liquids on the market. It will you way better.
3,what can i say,"i guess on some things it would work. i bought it hoping it would clean the grates on my bar b que grill. well, it does not. i think on MILD dirt or grease, it might do the job. i will probably unload it."
3,Too expensive ... Too little steam,"I bought this unit to replace my old ""Steam Buggy"" cleaner which stopped working after 3 years of service. However I was disappointed with this so called ""Heavy Duty"" Steam cleaner as it was considerably weaker than the Buggy.Pros:* Produces steam* Is sturdy and well built.Cons:* Is loud. So loud I have to wear earplugs* Steam preassure is weak (as compared with the Steam Buggy)* The 50-ounce tank last for 20 minutes. Is advertised to last for ""one full hour of use"". The Steam Buggy used to last for 15 mins with a 30-ounce tank.* Is a bit bulky. If it was truly ""Heavy Duty"" this would be acceptable, but it functions more on the ""light duty"" side."
3,"Close, no cigar","I picked up the MC1275 at a very attractive price while shopping for much higher priced units. As I know you ""get what you pay for"" I once agan shot myself in the foot and will end up spending more money to acquire a unit that is more capable.For a $100 steamer I suppose the MC1275 isn't all bad. It worked OK on linoleum floors although there was more water lef than I expected from ""steam"". Worked great on tile however no better or quicker than scrubing by hand. And those hard to clean corners with buildup... nope. Not even close.The real dealbreaker for me is the lack of available attachments. A canister steamer ought to have an attachment for removing wallpaper. It ought to have a smaller attachment for upholstery and curtains as well as one specifically for steaming clothes and draperies. Like I said, I'd been shopping for more capable and more expensive machines and ended up going for the bargain with predictable results."
5,I like this steamer.,This machine is better than our old machine. It holds a lot more water so you can clean for a longer time without reloading. It also has very long cords which gives you more mobility. I'm glad we purchased this steamer.
3,nice....,"i like the cleaner but i feel like the carpet part does not hold up to the hype i love the rest i clean the oven, bathroom, windows, and kitchen floor.... it does take a bit of elbow grease but does get the job done....."
3,"No sources cited, no bibliography","Eastern definitions means Eastern religions, not Christianity and not Judaism. The subtitle best sums up the contents: ""A short encyclopedia of religions of the Orient with terms from Hinduism, Sufism, Buddhism, Islam, Zen, Tao, the Sikhs, Zoroastrianism and other Eastern religions."" The terms are those most likely encountered by newcomers to Eastern religion such as Islam, Mahayana Buddhism, Mencius, Sai Baba and dharma. The outstanding feature is the book's readability in explaining with a minimum of jargon and academic hair splitting. Edward Rice includes 32 pages of black and white photographs, half of them candid shots of devotees in the act of worship.Edward Rice was a close friend of Thomas Merton (classmates at Columbia University) and wrote his biography The Man in the Sycamore Tree."
2,"I wanted to rate it higher, but couldn't","With this software package you get loads of images, 50,000 to be exact. Unfortunatly most of them are poorly composed so they're really boring. Because of this I would not recommend this package for professional designers. Also, despite the ability to export images in many different formats and resolutions, none of them are suitable for print. Even at the highest resolutions, images will be pixilated when printed. One positive for this product is the search engine and image viewer. When entering a search word, it updates the appropriate matches as you go. This saves time and makes it very easy to see what's available. Here's the bottom line, get this product if your interested in web design or you just want images for comping. Otherwise, look elsewhere."
5,Finally! A great image collection that is affordable.,"If there is a single image collection you should consider buying, this is it. Frustrated by juvenile graphics found in most clip art? Then look no further. I have used this on a number of websites and in presentations and to date have always found an image that matched what I had in mind. Another strong quality in this is its ease of use. Even if you are not a professional graphic artist or computer maven, you will find the interface user friendly and a snap to transfer the image to your program of choice. Really one of the best collections out there for the money."
2,"Quality Photos, But Not Quality Subjects","I bought this for use in making websites, which I do for a living. The ease of use is great. I found the search feature quite productive and found tons of images covering many categories.However, I must complain about what another reviewer here mentioned. The photos are high quality resolution wise and being able to customize the background is an excellent feature. But, the actual objects in the photos were less than satisfying. The objects were old and outdated. The items, as another reviewed mentioned, indeed looked old. And yes, the majority of the human models were far less than attractive.I am largely unable to use most of what is on these CD's to design professional commercial websites. Because I wasn't able to use it for what it is largely intended for, I rated this two stars. However, please note that there are good points, it is just the subjects of the pictures are not one of them."
1,Hemera is terrible to deal with...buggy software,"When you can get it to work it's great. Too bad it works so seldom. I've been installing and unistalling this for a few days now, it doesn't work well at all under win XP. And forget Hemera support, after 90 days you have to pay.BTW, the other collections have issues too, vol 2 is the worst out of the three. The collection is padded with substandard images."
3,It's nice but the zipper,Over all I feel this pullover is nice. On the other hand I think the black is more like super dark blue. I also feel the zipper is a bit cheap.
4,Clear copy,"This product is easy to install and always makes clean and clear copies without mess or fuss. I was happy to find it on Amazon, especially after the office supply store I had used did not carry it any longer. Delivery was just a few days and the price was less than the office supply store had been."
1,Bad films,Had a bad experience of buying a replacement instead of brand name. Carbon film comes out with ths fax paper. I had to order directly from Panasonic.I Haq
1,Itchy,"I did not like this bathing suit because it was very itchy. Even after washing it, I still was uncomfortable in it."
2,Looked great-felt terrible,"I loved the the color of this swimsuit. I liked the conservative design and it fit well. I did not like the material the bra cups were made of. They had a seam up the middle of the cup and the foam material was very itchy. I tried to wear the swimsuit anyway, but it was so uncomfortable I couldn't. Swimsuits are non-returnable, so if I can't sew in new cups, I am stuck with a suit I can't wear."
3,"Femme X, Karin Clercq's debut disc","Pawn the jewelry, if necessary, to buy this disc if only for ""Je t'ai dans la peau"" (""I've got you under my skin""). I heard it for the first time when I put the disc in the car player and I was knocked for a loop. It's a classic Edith Piaf song, but this interpretation marries all of Karin Clercq's best qualities in one track: a beautifully alto voice, incredibly clear diction, and a gorgeous Belgian accent. There's a strident guitar backup and a little subtle synthesizer in the background.The rest of the songs, original compositions all, are a little less stellar. The songs range all over the map, from female-power affirmations ""Ne Pas"" to the lust-at-first-sight of ""Désir."" It's a good record for those who are learning French, because it comes with a lyric booklet and her diction is so clear."
2,Nice to start with . . .,This book is clear and easy to read.I did have some problems getting to the source code. But a simple e-mail to Rampant TechPress (the publisher) took care of that in less than a day.Overall the book is good for a beginner just starting to learn about tuning.For more experience DBA's this is more of a review and a reminder of basic performance tuning.I was disappointed in that I was looking for more insight on what to do after you find the problems.
3,A tad disappointed,"I really love the way this urn LOOKS (mine is slightly different in that it does not have the bunny or the ferret); but it's poorly made. It's top-heavy and falls easily. One of the wings broke before I even got the angel home (I bought it from a local crematorium) and I have yet to be able to fix it. Superglue didn't work at all. Hot glue works as long as I don't touch it. My cat rubbed up against it the other day and it toppled over and now the halo has broken off, too.For the money paid, I really think this should be better constructed. I now have four pets using this as their urn (two med/lg dogs and two cats)...so it's completely filled. It's STILL top-heavy.Again, I realllllly love the way this urn looks....but that's about all I like about it."
4,it works,the CD plays with no problem but the booklet looks like it had some water damage. there is no issue with the quality of the text and pictures that are there. but looks like it was at some time wet and dried up.
1,"Unimaginative, boring rehash","One of those books whose principal purpose is to take up space. Try Deborah Spar for recent books on cartels, or Hexner for the period between the two world wars. A bore, not worth a dime."
3,It is OK,"I got this vacuum cleaner for 34.99 on ebay. I added $10 for shipping. I like it because you can carry it. It has a really good suction, but, since it is bagless and cyclonic, it produces unusual amount of noise while cleaning. It is not too loud just funny. I had Shark canister by Euro-pro for about a year. I like this one better except for the cord storage. This one has a little door on the back of the vacuum cleaner that you need to put the cord after the use. It is a bit more difficult to put it back in and close the door. Also, it is good for floor and carpets (better the Euro-pro for carpets). I have a constant-shedding dog and this is not the best vacuum cleaner you could get for dog hair but for $34.99 it does enough. I think it might last me for about a year. These are all made in China and they lack quality parts to last longer but I might be surprised."
5,Come Away Home,A great family movie I have watched it several time and I will watch it many more. The point made waswe should not only see things as they might seem but open our hearts to others to feel and see things differently
3,Come away home...,"A family movie about family, forgiveness, and misunderstandings. The main character is disturbed because she is being forced to stay with her grandpa for the summer while her parents go on a honeymoon/anniversary trip. She discovers many things while being there, one being that family is important!"
4,Inspiring.,At first i didnt think i was going to like it.. But as the movie progressed i began to get more interested in it... By the end i thought all teens should watch it.. I believe young and elders should share time together and learn respect for each other.. We elders have something to teach and learn from the young... young just need encouragment from us and sometimes direction.. it was inspiring movie for families..
3,Family Time Movie,This is a nice safe movie to watch for the whole family. It's pretty good over all but some of the acting could have been better. It's nice though to have a film with a good message that your whole family can see. There really isn't much to offer on TV that is truly family friendly anymore.
2,Expected more,"The movie had a good message overall, but I didn't care much for the girl's bad attitude and independence. I think it set a bad example for girls her age. Her mother seemed to just abandon her and I thought that was strange. With 2 girls ages 8 and 13, I am always trying to find films that really show innocence in pre-teen girls. I guess maybe that doesn't exist these days. I also did not care for the teenage romance in the film, these kids are just WAY too young to be worrying about the opposite sex and this movie encourages that in my opinion.Pretty good acting, but we won't be watching it again anytime soon, in fact we might just get rid of it."
4,very 50's very cute and unique and very summer-y,"This is done very 50's style, a period that I love. If you are into that period, and like simple but classic lines, this is the dress for you. The material is thin, cottony, so this is not an outfit to wear in the wintertime or fall. This works for only a classic figure and I've gotten tons of compliments on this dress and it looks just wonderful and perfect on me. It's a dress I always pack when I travel -- it's a very easy maintenance dress that can be dressed up or dressed down. Highly recommended."
1,uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuugly,"it is so ugly!! the fabric is horrible and I wouldnt wear this dress around the house! the picture makes it look adorable but dont be fooled, they make it impossible to return so I cant even get my money back"
5,GREAT MINI VAC,This has great power and much better than those cordless vacs which you will have to throw away after a year or so.
1,Too Hot to Handle,The vacuum I received quickly overheated and became too hot to hold or handle. The suction was great and the size very convienent. But the heat from the motor made it impossible to use safely.
1,THANKS TO REVIEWERS - SAVED ME FROM BUYING THIS ITEM,"Just wanted to thank the reviewers..........saved me from buying this one. I'm going for the Shark for about the same amount of money on eBay - ALSO, anyone shopping for these vacs, please note that even the Shark comes in various suction strengths and power, depending on what you need it for.THANKS PREVIOUS PURCHASERS for your comments! You saved me from making a poor purchase! :-)"
2,"OK, but already looking for a new hand vac","I bought this vacuum in 2005, mainly to keep the couches clean of dog hair. This vacuum works OK, but only gets a little bit of the hair. Cup fills up real fast. My mom has a Shark and that just sucked up the dirt and hair. So I will probably replace this with a newer Shark."
1,Wrong product,"I ordered this vacuum and was sent a ""CleanFast"" Model OC-910 that looks pretty much like this one. I don't know if CleanFast bought Orca, but I expect the same product I ordered. I haven't opened the box yet to try the vacuum because I'm considering returning it."
4,Pretty good!,"I used this book for my Introduction to Number Theory class. I enjoy Silverman's writing style, but I wish there were some more examples and a little bit more theory involved.It seemed to me as though there were a LOT of topics covered in a short about of time, but I would have liked to have seen some more of the actual meat behind it.Not bad though!"
3,great dairy free recipes with a lot of flavor,I remembered my mom using this book when I was young. She still cooks a couple of favorites. When we realized our daughter had a dairy intolerance and we realized we had to revamp our entire menu of favorite foods. This book immediately came to mind. I am so glad I got it! We love flavorful food...and these recipes have that!
5,ABOVE EXCELENT,"I Have tried many Low-Fat Recipes book but LET'S EAT! is the best so far, talk about delicious!!! I have been looking for ways to add variety, style, and taste to my low fat dishes, this is the answer! Now that I have so many tasty low fat recipes it is easier to stick to my plan and lose pounds fast. I highly recommend using this super LOW FAT RECIPES COOK BOOK to anyone on a meal plan. It's a must buy. I cant do without it.C'mon America, Let's Eat! Susan's Favorite Low-fat Recipes to Fit Your Lifestyle"
1,Not worth the money,"Having just finished watching the Long Way Round video set (excellent), this was an extreme letdown. It was more of an infomercial for Globeriders, documenting the travel of a group of nobodys, with nothing insightful to say. Not much scenery, not very well narrated. Very dissapointed with this purchase."
4,Made my friend want to buy a Dual Sport!,"I bought this DVD for a riding buddy who was having cabin fever. The only problem, it made it worse! Now he wants to buy a Dual Sport and start doing some adventure riding!"
4,"Simple, Straightforward, and Very Useful","This video really helps me ""get"" some moves that had been eluding me before. I like Princess Farhana's no-frills style of instruction and have probably used this DVD more than any of my other beginning belly dance selections. I feel it was well worth the money I paid for it and I recommend it to anyone who is trying to learn the basics of belly dance."
1,Absolutely Awful,"I'm quite unsure how anyone gave this a good review. They must have NEVER seen ANY other belly dance video in the world EVER. The girl seems like she's on drugs. Her teaching skills are awful. If you must see this terrible monstrosity, rent it from the library. Don't waste your money. I highly recommend one of Jenna's DVD's."
2,"All has been said, this dvd sucks!","I just bought this dvd, but it was over before it even started. The workout was so short, did not even brake a sweat, I could not believe it was over so soon. The whole workout session was like a warm-up! Seems many of these belly dancing dvds are all about bios, and promoting their clubs, gyms, whatever, than of really focusing on teaching how to dance, which is why I purchased this in the first place. In the end She spent a good part of the video dancing in full costume, but for what!? I did not buy this video to see how good she can dance, I expected to see how good she can dance and SHOW me how I can achieve the same. Total dissapointment, don't even bother with this dvd, spend a little bit more money on a dvd that has more instruction, rather than intros, bios, and show off performances that don't teach you anything. You will learn a thing or two, but that's it! Really, a THING OR TWO............"
5,devestating,"I first read Ponchaud's work some 25 yrs. ago. I was shocked, devastated, angry and stunned. As a university student I naively thought that this sort of thing ended during the Second War. Sadly, the years have taught me that this is not the case. I think in our current state of affairs that this study should be re-read before we (the USA) set up other nations for failure as we did in Cambodia and seem intent on doing in Afghanistan and Iraq. ""Those who forget the past are condemed to repeat its mistakes."" Let us not forget. Ponchaud's work must be kept alive."
3,Pretty average,"This is a passable book on probability. It is a halfway house between undergraduate probability and measure theoretic probability. Generally speaking, it lacks rigour; statements like ""the proof is surprisingly difficult so we only give a heuristic justification"" are not good enough, especially when the author does not then bother to refer the reader to a source where the proof can be found. Also, I felt that not enough was done to frame things in the language of measure theory.Overall, the exposition is serviceable but dull. There are also a lot of typographical errors (missed out words and typos in equations) and a few incorrect proofs (e.g. the proof of Minkowski's inequality). All in all, considering its flaws and price, you can ""probably"" do a lot better."
3,A decent graduate text on probability,"This is the text book we used when I took a probability course in Johns Hopkins. The book covers all basic topics and provides a fair introduction to measure-theory based probability theory (without heavy dose of measure theory). However, when it gets to more advanced topics, like the chapters on the central limit theorems and martingales, the text is less lucid and full of typos and mistakes. At times, it became so frustrating to read that I could only wish we had used a better book."
2,I tried to get through it,"Being a huge fan of vintage stock car racing, I gave this a try despite all of the poor reviews. I figured I would be happy to see some vintage cars and maybe some good race scenes, even if the movie itself was mediocre. It really is a bad movie. The acting is terrible, the plot is non-existent. It isn't really even interesting from a historical standpoint."
2,Not for the bootstrapping indie filmmaker,"This book seems to be getting amazing reviews. I bought this book based on these reviews. I'll tell you this, I don't know who these people are who are reviewing it. I don't think they're quite like me.Pros:1. There are some legal contracts that may be useful for some independent filmmakersCons:1. Any legal contract this book has can be found for free on the internet2. This book seems to be for people who are actually employed in the film industry. If you're an independent filmmaker running around with a DSLR, 95% of the topics in this book doesn't even apply to you (this is the position I found myself in)I can't really write much more. Just wanted to give a heads up to cash starved indie filmmakers to not spend their money on this."
4,Maria Ivogun outshines them all!,"Another magic cave from ancient 78 rpm. recordings lovingly collected and presented here by ""Prima Voce"",british company specialised in pre-WW2 material.Sequel to ""Great singers 1909-1938"" this compilations unearth more forgotten classical stars who were immensely popular at the beginning of the last century but sadly neglected today.I was immediately struck with sonority of Mary Garden,loved Ezio Pinza (ordered his own CD) and liked few others but the singer who was definitely a discovery was dazzling coloratura soprano from Germany (actualy born in Budapest) wonderful Maria Ivogun.Completely in a class of her own,Ivogun was out of this world and she has to be heard to be believed.Like so many times in the past,this compilation led me to Maria Ivogun and I didnt stop until I found her own CD and did some research - apparently she later became music teacher to Elisabeth Schwarzkopf,both dazzled in R.Strauss and here one can hear where Schwarzkopf came from."
5,great tool,"I bought this jade iron for my hair, unfortunatly, but very fortunatly, I have a lot of hair, so this size was not practical for me, I needed a much larger size which which was not available, but this is a nice iron and does shine your hair, it just takes me all day with my hair type, I recomned this product for people with thinner hair than mine."
1,flat iron tool,I still have not received it the hot tools wigo professional 1 1/2in ultimate jade flat iron WG5319 purchased on 3/31/2009 if you cannot provide the product please send me my refund a.s.a.p. you cooperation is greatly appreciated
3,okAY,"It was an okay series.i didn't agree with some of the people, like princess diana, her death is why she is inspirational?? come on! And Isaac Newton definately was the most influential."
4,Very good -- I wanted more,"This series made me want to study more about many of the individuals selected. I, like most others I'm sure, disagreed with some of the choices and agreed with others, but they were all informative, entertaining and interesting. My biggest complaint is that the summaries were too brief -- I wanted more! Harry Smith does an excellent job, as always."
2,biased views,"It is a pity that Biography wasted such a great opportunity to produce a wonderful video, mostly due to a terrible selection of commentators. (Ret.)Gen. Schawrzkopf's commentary about Simon Bolivar is an outrage; any serious historian knows that Bolivar was anything but a ruthless dictator who opened the doors to the modern latinamerican authoritarian regimes.There were many members of the 100-list who are questionably worth having been included, far too many americans, besides.I think a revision or re-make of this material should be made, and this time, please, have serious, more expert people making the comments."
1,Piece of Junk,"This pepper mill is a nothing but a piece of junk. I ordered two of them. The motor on the first one died within 10 seconds of putting the batteries in. On the second one, the motor is ""working"", but it is not turning the metal rod, so all you get is the motor noise and no grinds. The motor has all plastic, fine teeth gears - even if you get lucky and get it to grind a teaspoon before it dies, how long do you think that's going to last? Don't throw your money away on this bottom of the barrel ""made in china"" junk."
2,Very ladylike,"I was extremely disappointed with this workout. I am knocking 70 but I cannot imagine getting much out of these routines for another 10 years or so. However for anyone who has not spent much time exercising, the moves are very simple and undemanding. They may be better suited to convalescence or advanced years. Those with reasonable body fitness are likely to find them lacking in challenge and unlikely to produce the desired results of significantly improved flexibility and balance."
2,Inuyasha Deserves Better!,"I can't believe I bought this game knowing that it was a fighting game. The arenas are way too small, and the gameplay is just horrible.With games out there like Ninja Gaiden, Inuyasha Feudal Combat could have been SO much better! I don't know if Ban Dai is just that bad or what. Not much thought and effort went into this one. They should be embarrassed. I wish I had listened to my instincts and kept my money."
5,** RE-TITLING OF A PREVIOUS BOOK **,"I want people to be aware that this book was previously released as, ""Lose 200 Pounds This Weekend: It's Time to DeClutter Your Life."" I find that practive a tad deceptive. For more reviews & a better price, see the other book."
4,This man has a sense of humor!!!,"Loved this book! It was full of helpful hints as well as a sense of humor! It has taken longer than a weekend for me, but was worth it! I wonder ""why"" I saved all of the stuff that I did for so long!! :-)"
2,Disappointed.,"The picture of this item makes it look as though the cover has a box-shaped edge which is supposed to keeep the feather bed from moving as you sleep on it. The cover I got has no such shape. It is no different than a the plain cover I could have purchased for less money. I am very disappointed, and I feel like a paid for a higher quality product (see product description) and I did not get it."
3,No bonus CD as advertised,I bought this because I had to as a Pink Floyd collector. It says that it comes with a bonus CD. It does not. Even though my copy had the same sticker as seen in the picture here that advertises a bonus CD there was no CD in the package.
2,"A curiosity, but not worth it.","Interesting concept, but not fully realized. I kept waiting for something to happen ... nothing did. The ""making of"" short was more interesting than the movie."
4,"Light pleasant smell, very pricey","This has a pleasant citrus smell but not very powerful and not very enduring. The sensation on the skin is satisfying, perhaps a bit sticky but only for a few moments. Absorbs very fast, not shiny, non-drying. Not as fantastic as I expected but still very nice. I would say try it once and decide for yourself. I'm going to try a cheaper aftershave before I buy another bottle. It's good just not sure it's 25$ good."
3,Not as good as price would have you think it is.,"The ingedients are not the best, it contains Yellow #5. However, the use of menthol and other natural ingredients does leave skin refreshed briefly. The scent is nice and light, but this has no longevity in regards to how well it moisturizes the skin. I have a very sensitive skin with a pretty tough beard, and this just doesn't cut it as an aftershave. If using it as a pre-shave oil, it works better, however, i prefer Proraso's White Pre-Shave Cream."
5,Excellent Grooming Product,"The cost is high, but the quality is outstanding. It takes very little to cover freshly shaved areas so it lasts a long time. The aroma is subtle and it feels excellent. My wife loves how it smooths my skin. I like the refreshing feel and the protection from foreign debris prevents breakouts and calms slight razor burn."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"Pros* Fits like a glove (goes without saying)* Um... Peace of mind?Cons* This case makes pushing the buttons harder than it already is.* There is nothing to protect the screen.* If you're left-handed (or like to operate gadgets with your left hand) note that it is impossible to push the Menu button. It would take a double-jointed freak of nature to comfortably push it.* The case is a dust and hair magnet. Every time you pull it out of your pocket, it's encrusted with lint you didn't even know you had. Dust manages to sneak under every surface, and hair magically sticks to it. This case is a DNA-sample paradise for forensic experts.One of the features of a flash-based memory player is the fact that they won't break as easily when you drop them. Unless you're paranoid about getting scratches on your shiny new Sansa, don't buy this."
4,Good Case,this case is quite gd actulli does pick up a lil bit of lint but it does its job well...havent dropped it though since getting this case but glad to knw its well protected now..thanx amazon
5,Great book!,"I really didn't know what to expect when I got this book as a present, but I actually found it extremely useful in my writing. The chapters on Joseph Campbell and Carl Jung really helped me with structure for my script, and the other chapters are also full of useful insights into the psychology behind developing characters and plots. I recommend this book more than ""The Writer's Journey,"" which I found less helpful."
4,Highly recommended for writers,"The strength of this book is its ability to present theories of psychology in a concise, constructive way. Reading Indick while writing a screenplay will give you constant reminders of what good stories have to come down to, character psychology. As a key to watching and understanding movies and their characters -- let alone a discussion of psychology -- this book is more limited, but for writers looking for quick, practical help it's invaluable."
5,"great coverage, inspiring","This book is not only inspirational for screenwriters, helping them understand how various psychological theories actually work and could be applied to creating characters, but it is a very good, succinct overview of psychological theories in general. Reading this helps screenwriters to ground their work in how people actually function."
5,outstanding,"Best read I have had in a long time. Book was so inspiring, I could not put it down. Gave me a better appreciation for my horses, our relationship, and their health. Healing message of this book could not have come at a better time."
5,Real and Succinct,"THis is a story of a woman who comes to understand her own weaknesses by virtue of her relationship with a recued horse. THe style is poignant; the writing sparse and perfunctory, a reflection of her own lack of emotional connectedness to others but a foil for her love of an animal that gave her unquestioning trust. The book is a quick read and I think anyone who knows the human/animal bond will be able to relate to the story."
2,Not what I expected or hoped it would read.,"Based on other reader's comments, I purchased this book in anticipation of a great story. Somewhat disappointed and expected much more. Would not recommend purchasing; borrow from a friend or library."
4,Chosen by a Horse,"A beautiful moving tale aimed especially at lovers of horses. I loved this book, this lady was very blessed to have had such a deep and loving relationship with the beautiful LayMeDown. I cried at the beauty of their love for each other, especially at the end."
3,Interesting Story,"This was an interesting story and fulfilled my need to read. However, I was a little disatisfied with the lack of resolution in the story. I was waiting for an ending to wrap the story up that never came."
5,Wonderful Story about the Magic of Horses,"Beautiful story about a woman who rescues a neglected horse and at the same time is changed. The rescued horse, Lay Me Down, has a gentle and loving nature even after suffering a terrible life. And this kindness makes Susan re-evaluate her life and the abuse she suffered as a child and in her marriage. I was pulled into the story and enjoyed it to the end even though I was crying.I highly recommend this book if you love a good horse story. I finished this book in one day!"
5,A Treasure You Should Not Miss,"Susan rescues a sickly, abused mare and, in the process of nursing her back to health, becomes deeply attached to this creature who has suffered so much and yet, given the chance, is able to love and enjoy life.It is the story of both Susan and Lay Me Down, the rescued mare. Susan deals with a childhood of abandonment and extreme emotional abuse through the gentle and remarkable example of Lay Me Down.A wonderful and well written story. You really must read it!"
5,"""Rescue me, take my heart""","Richards book is about herself, maybe more than about a horse. Her story rings true to those of us who work with rescue animals. We start out thinking we are going to do something for the critters. Often, maybe usually, it seems that one or more of them seeks us out as though they know that we need what they have to offer. Richards' horse sought her out and it was Richards who was rescued as much as the mare and her foal. It's a worthwhile book if you're involved with animals or if such involvement doesn't make any sense to you."
3,"""To love without an echo is the death knell of the soul.""","Chosen by a Horse is a memoir about a forty-three year old divorced woman named Susan Richards. Although she does share information about her childhood (death of a parent at a young age, victim of child abuse), it specifically focuses on the time in her life during which she was the caregiver of an abused horse (seized from its owner by the ASPCA) named Lay Me Down. From her experiences with her charge, she learns important lessons about life. Ultimately, she loses a friend but gains perspective. The author provides an honest, heartfelt view of her own personal issues and interesting (and often sad) details about her experiences with Lay Me Down - probably best appreciated by horse lovers.Readers that enjoy this book may also like: Seabiscuit by Laura Hillenbrand, Lighting Up by Susan Shapiro, and All the Pretty Horses by Cormac McCarthy."
4,A beautaful book,"This is a very well written book, I had a hard time ever putting it down. It is sincere, and heartfelt. You will find yourself crying through most of the story. I think anyone who has ever loved a horse needs to read it."
4,Horse story,I purchased this book for a 9th grade student who adores horses. The student enjoyed the book but felt the author's digressions might be overly dramatic for younger readers (younger than 9 years old).
4,Chosen by a Horse,"I enjoyed reading this book about a horse's love healing a broken woman. Sure, Susan may have thought she was doing the rescuing, but in the end, she and Lay Me Down rescued each other. How on Earth Lay Me Down stayed so sweet and nice after the neglect she suffered is beyond me. Hotshot, Lay Me Down's horse buddy, made me wish for my friends, all living far way now, who have stuck so close in good times and in bad ones. Any animal lover will enjoy reading this endearing memoir."
3,A tearjerker and an emotional journey of a 40ish divorced woman,"This book is a tearjerker. I just grabbed a bunch of books with horses in them off of the library shelf and this was one of them.40ish woman who lives alone in her house takes in an abused horse. The abused horse lavishes her with affection and is just so sweet, that the author is inspired. If this horse can love humans after being abused and starved nearly to death, why can't the author be more open to love and affection in her own life too?There was a lot of soul searching in this book on the part of the author and a lot of insight about middle age and divorce and loneliness. This is NOT a light book. This is NOT a happy book. This is NOT a book primarily about horses. This is a book to read when you want to see someone grow and change for the better."
5,Chosen By A Horse,"This is a MUST READ for anyone who has lost a horse, whether to injury, old age or an illness. A very easy read and well worth the money."
5,Excellent writing - wonderful Story,"I totally enjoyed this book, had a hard time putting it down. I feel like I knew Lay Me Down from your writing... what a wonderful horse."
5,Touching reading,I saw this book at the store in the corner of my eye. When I read the cover I was inspired to buy it feeling that I could relate to the rescued horse story. Susan is very passionate in this book. There were funny moments and sad also. I deffinitely related to it. I highly reccomend this book. It was a great read and now is one of my favorites.
5,Chosen by a Horse,"This was a wonderful read. It took me back to when I owned horses and all the emotions of loving them. The interaction is so powerful with a horse, it's incredible. Susan described these so wonderfully. Books like this are much appreciated. Thanks for writing it."
5,A very beautiful and loving story.....,"This is a very loving and beautiful story, especially if you love horses. A very moving story you could read time and again. This book would make a great stocking stuffer!"
1,give a horse a break...,"I'm a lifetime horse owner, lover of horses and books. I wish I could tell this woman that her horses are not about her. She also needs to realize that a good writer doesn't feed off of sentimental groupthink."
1,Borrow from the Library,Not that interesting. It was slow and lacked depth. Do not waste your money. Borrow from the library.
2,Disappointing,"This will make a number of people frustrated, but I wanted to shout ""grow up"" to the immature woman at the center of this book. Wealth, privilege and all the trappings -- and an almost meaningless life. I venture that many may find the book of interest. I did only mildly and with slight curiosity to how the author would end. If you want to read something of value, I recommend substituting ""Kite Runner"" or other books with more enduring value to the reader."
5,Couldn't put it down,It's been a while since I sat down and read through a third of a book and didn't want to put it down. But I had to get up in the morning. Great 5 star read!!!!
5,insperational and very well written,lovely lovely story about true love between woman and horse and how they both teach eachother life lessons.susan s a fantasti writter and has several heartfelt moments in her book.this will inspire all because of real life situations and how to overcome all life throws at you.truley amazing and tearjerker
2,Lost interest halfway through.,"I bought the book thinking it was about the horse, but quickly discovered that it was about the woman and her dysfunctional life. Sorry, but I can get enough human dysfunction in real life. The horse was a complete nonentity, standing around in the pasture while the woman angsted about her childhood and marriage somewhere else entirely.Possibly in the second half the horse actually played a part, but I gave up before I got that far. There aren't many books that I don't finish, but this was one of them."
2,Definitely not for the real horse-person,"This book was well written, I will have to say that much about it. It was written by a person who is an avid horse person for sure but the person that doesn't have horses for any reason other than to keep the pastures mowed. For me, a western horse-person, it just didn't seem to fit my tastes. Overall, it was well written, just not a ""knock-your-socks-off"" lind of read. I wouldn't read it again and if I had known it was what it is, I wouldn't have ordered it."
2,Disappointing,"I liked the first part of the story to some degree. However, I have a strong belief that horses need to have quality lives. I never felt like this mare had that. The author kept the mare alive to help herself, not so much the horse. Owning horses requires pragmatism as well as love. Horses don't think like people and they don't perceive their world as humans perceive. While I enjoyed the author's redemptive recovery, overall I did not care for the story and felt the author used the horse in a way not consonant with using animals. If the animal could reason and feel more fully, would it have been happy to have its life extended in the way it worked out? I don't think so."
3,Good book for young reader,"This is book about a woman who, emotionally and physically abused as a child, acquired an old, abused horse that taught her many of life's most important lessons. It is a good book for a younger reader: teens and young adults. Although the writer is able to adequately convey the insights into her own psyche that this experience gave to her, she was evidently unable to describe the depths of these insights and the impact they had upon her life. I expected more information about how working with this old mare changed the author's life. It's an okay book for the adult reader, if you want a ""light"" read without a great deal of emotional involvement. Yes, it does cover many life lessons, but not to any great degree."
2,Ok book,as a social worker and horse trainer I was excited to read this book after reading the back of it but it has been pretty disappointing so far. I'm not done (about 3/4 through) so maybe it will get better but it is so boring! Nothing happens at all and I feel like it's just about the life of any random person who adopts a horse and has it in her backyard.
3,Disappointing,"Upon reading the summary of the book, I fully expected more of a transformation of the author due to her relationship with Lay Me Down. I didn't really see that much change. I loved the story about the horses though. Lay Me Down really touched my heart."
5,Great book,This is a good book. A quick but very touching read. If you rlove horses or any animals this will make you cry. I loved it.
5,A Must-Read!,"I think I was ""chosen"" by this book. If you love horses (or if you love animals), you MUST read this book. I have read it twice now, and I never read books twice. Not to sound corny, but this book helped to renew my faith in mankind, and it reminds us all the difference that just ONE person can make in the life of an animal. Animals have no voice; this patient & dedicated author gave one to a horse in a desperate situation."
5,Excellent book,"I just finished reading Chosen By A Horse. It's probably one of the best non-fiction books that I've ever read. Susan Richards knows how to keep a reader turning the pages. And you don't have to know much about horses to understand where she's coming from, because she pretty much explains it. I have a girlfriend that keeps three or four horses and loves them as Richards loved her horses. Life was not kind to Susan Richards when she was very young and certainly she's had a life story to tell. I must say, she's handled a young life that dealt her lemons by making lemonade. My hat's off to this lady. I have her second book, Chosen For Life. My next book to read. My advice if you pick Chosen By A Horse up to read...keep a box of Kleenex handy. You'll need it."
5,Sweet Story for Horse Lovers,"I really enjoyed this book, and have bought more copies to give to friends as gifts. Easy read, sweet story - anybody who has ever undertaken a journey with an animal will relate to this beautiful little book."
2,Didn't really like it.,"More about the author than horses, which might be fine, but bottom line the book did not move me.This is yet another book that arose from a creative writing course. It is not a creative work of fiction, but a recounting of a life story.I love horses, love horse books, but not this one."
5,Don't Be Fooled by the Title,"This is a wonderfully moving story which could be about any animal, just happens to be a horse. I'm not a horse person, but this story created for me an appreciation of why one might be. The bigger story is about love and healing the heart, and it would appeal to anyone who has ever been in pain (which is all of us!)."
2,"WELL WRITTEN, THOROUGHLY DEPRESSING","I started reading this book and was carried by its flowing words and interesting story line. Then, I realized that it was not about a horse, but a woman's inner journey. I wish I had never started it. It is very sad indeed."
5,One of the best ever...,"Bjoerling is amazing from start to finish on this disc. I was surprised by how many of the arias were sung in a language (Swedish?) other than their original language. So if you want Puccini in Italian, you may want to check out another recording. Verdi's ""Ingemisco"" and Rossini's ""Cujus Animam"" are highlights."
4,sponge,"never got it it was sent ups they refused to leave it with out me signing for it ...please it was a sponge this isnt there fault its ups i dont like using them they have lose, break an kept me stuff i am done using or buying from anyone who uses this shipper."
4,funnel cake mix,This is very good and just like the gourmet ones at the fair. I haven't tried a plain recipe for funnel cake with ingredients which are very simple. Perhaps you could make funnel cake much cheaper and almost just as easy with simple ingredients. The price is very high on this product. I paid less in a very priced grocery store.
1,Doooo what?,"Gary Gallagher has assembled various essayists to compile this latest explanation of the turning point of the Civil War. These 'authors' have added conjecture, opinions, and heresay for this great battle. Mr Gallaghers donation to this work is excerpts from diarists, letters, and newspaper articles of the day. Not one original idea comes from him. There is nothing new here! In fact, the most important factor of this battle, ie. Lost Order #191 isn't even mentioned here. I was disappointed (and I wasn't expecting very much). Instead pick up ""Landscape Turned Red"" by Stephen W Sears."
4,The Greatest Pagliacci EVER,"Many people are born to sing, but few are born to sing like the angels. Beniamino Gigli is truly the most remarkable tenor of this century. While he peformed on both sides of the Atlantic, in New York, London, Italy, and Germany for nearly his entire career, he remained loyal to his family, friends, colleagues, and record company with little ego and great warmth. Above all else, his voice had a lyrical quality that remains unique, even in the age of the three tenors. Pagliacci was his signature role, and performed it with such abandon, that it took a toll on his voice over the years, but the 1922 recording on this CD is him doing what he does best. The 1923 'M'appari tutto amor' is also very nice.Get this along with volume 2, and settle back for a real treat."
5,"Surprise, Surprise!...","From the name and the cover of this album, you are almost inclined to stereotype it as 'another dumb rap album', but once you listen to it you do a total 180!! It was actually good!...Ya Boyy surprises the listener with his one of a kind style and his tracks are awesome. You can tell he is a serious artist that cares about his music. His choice of producers, and guest artists on his album speak volumes. Definatly one for the collection. Definatly one of the best ten albums I've heard this year and one of only about two or three that were actually worth the money."
1,Misled,"This book is entitled "" Coat of Arms"" ., meaning to any rational person, the book would be information and illistrations of med-evil "" Coat of Arms"" not-- The book does not contain any information onf Coat of Arms. i am not sure what it includes. It does not make any sense."
1,The book failed explain anything,"I bought this book one year ago because there were some good reviews from two authors I respected, Jeff and Jeffrey. I wished that I could learn something indepth about COM/ActiveX. Unfortrnately, I found this book one of the mostly unused books among my compter books. I don't think the text in the book explain anything at all. I don't know why he even put texts in the book. We would have a much thiner book if he just put exercises in the book and the quality of the book would be the same."
3,"Very useful, but also maddening.","There's typos on every page. The material's old. It's the size of a phone book. And yet despite all this, I still recommend this book, because it has clear, *practical* language and is very hands-on."
2,May get you started... But,"This book is simple, well organized, and easy to read. HOWEVER, that is the book's downside. If you need to write a COM application your going to need more detailed books. Those detailed books will cover what this covers in the first few chapters. ""Learning DCOM"", ""Inside COM+"" are places to start"
5,ITS ABOUT TIME!!!!,I liked the book I got it like a couple of months ago and I still read it over and over and over......Im sure all you Zoey&Lucas lovers will too :)Although the timing was PRETTY LATE(when you read it youll know what I mean) The only thing I hated was how they ended the series. I mean it was good but it couldve been better I wish I couldve read a better GRAND FINALE :).But overall the book was good just wasnt the best. The last couple of books I kinda hated Zoey for the way she treated Lucas...but its pretty funny and weird how she finds out her TRUE feelings for him. I DEFINATELY reccomend the book I mean who wouldnt its the last of the series. Im just saying dont expect TOO much because then you might be set up for a real let down :)
2,Zoey Comes Home,"Well, as we all know this is the last book in the series. Well, in truth the last book was number seven. That's when she stopped writing them and somebody took over for her. That's why they've been getting so stupid. Anyway, this book completely ignored Jake. Not that I'm fond of Jake. Whenever his part of the book came up I just skipped it. So why am I complaining? Don't know. Hmmm, what else. Zoey was annoying as always. It's not her fault, they completely twisted her original character. Oh, this book was okay, but I suggest the first seven or so books so much more than this one."
4,Argh.,"I had been reading these books since they had their original covers (if y'all had been reading this series when they first came out, you know what I'm talking about) and it wasn't called ""Making Out,"" the series was called Boyfriends/Girlfriends. She quit writing them for quite a few years and then, one day, I wanted to see if anymore had come out and there were a bunch of new ones. I was so excited! But, now I'm a little upset that I even started reading them again because KA decided to stop writing them again. Hopefully, she's just taking another break like she did before. Honestly, I was reading these books at probably 12 or 13, then again when I was about 21 (when she wrote the new ones....I think), and I'd buy #29 now (at 24) if she'd write it. I swear if she wrote more that I'd be all about buying it, even if I was 30. I love fluff reading....when you read scientific journals and textbooks all day long, you need a little fluff! It's great stuff!"
4,So sad!,"It's a great book, I mean all the making out books were great but the only problem is that this seemed to be the last and Nina and Benjamin didn't get back together! They have to get back together!They belong together. I just hope Katherine Applegate changes her mind and writes a book which ties up ALL the loose ends. Please..."
4,at last!,i just began to read the making out series last week but i already read 7 as they are so adictive.This book was refreshing as it tied up the Nina/Lucas relantionship and it looks like the Zoey/Lucas & Nina/Ben couples will be given a second chance. The only thing that bugs me is Aisha as she needs to get a grip.
5,A Very Good Place to Start with Caruso's Art,"The best transfer of Caruso I can lay my hand on so far. There is no surface noise and the beauty of his voice is not at all compromised, it sounds as though it is recorded in the 50s !Caruso eclipses the great tenors of all other ages with ease. However be reminded that to some audience, his singing is dated at least so in term of taste. Others may wish to add more songs or arias to show the best of his voice etc.The fact is, this CD runs 69.31 minutes which is more than sufficicinet to give the audience a good profile of the greatest voice of the century."
3,"Hoping for a return to ""Clandestine"" days...","Since ENTOMBED's ""Clandestine"" is one of my all time favorite albums, I was hoping for something along those lines. Well that's pretty much what I got, minus the intensity and atmosphere though,(Intensity is what makes CLANDESTINE so good). I like the song titles & lyrics and the fact that they're not taking it too seriously. But there's something that is just not very exciting about it. Maybe I expected too much. I have a feeling the next recording might be better."
1,Ponderous Writing Style,"First - I have not read this entire book. I saw an article on it and was intrigued enough to dig up the first chapter which is excerpted several places on the web. I found reading it very difficult, so I went back and read it again to see if it was me or the writing. I believe the problem is that the writing is impenetrable. For example, take a look at the third paragraph - it consists of one sentence that wanders around for over a hundred words. In that space it meanders from Karl Marx to the Salem witch trials to Jack Welch and GE. It merely caps off the first two one sentence paragraphs that come in at over 40 words and over 60 words. By the time I got to the fourth sentence I was exhausted."
3,Footnotes Long and Annoying,"Each page is 1/2 copy, and 1/2 footnotes. The author uses so many different footnotes, that he has to revert to sometimes as many as 5 different sybmols on a single page.A (not literal) example:The greed was born early in* Jack Welch* Here, I use the classical ""in"". You may think I mean ""With the characteristic, attribute, or property of: a tall man in an overcoat."", but I really mean ""Located inside; inner."". More information about the word ""in"" can be found in Fred Smith's, 1998 book, ""The History of the Word 'In'"", published by Harper & Collins, 2nd edition paperback.I apprectiate the depths of your research, Byron, but this is really annoying and hard to read."
3,Juicy anecdotes ... but that's it...,"I was not impressed with this book, I was expecting a bit more than the usual gossip-type information."
3,an entertaining little hissy fit,"This was an entertaining little hissy fit on the part of the author. I have never read, even in college texts a book with such lengthy footnotes. Sometimes I felt like I was reading two different books on the same page. I finally gave up reading the footnotes, and that made for a very fast read.This book is about 75% trash Jack Welch, 25% trash everyone else. I'd like to have learned what ultimately became of Al Dunlop, the most loathsome of the bunch. No cancer or raging impotence stories to cheer us up?This is the kind of book to take to the beach to read, but you might want to put a different jacket on it so no one knows of your guilty pleasure."
1,"Nice angle, terrible book....","Hoping to gain some insight into the behavior of Corporate Exec gone bad, I picked up this book........MISTAKE!This book is the National Enquirer of books. Ridiculous pop psychology that would make a first-year psych. student howl with laughter (It was the testosterone! No. Wait. It was because his mother called him a punk!)The footnote system is insane. Memo to Mr. Bryon: the use of metaphors (such as Lillith) typically do require footnotes to explain them.Conclusions and assumptions made by others are pushed aside to give more room to Mr. Byron's equally fallacious assumptions and illogical conclusions.Poorly written. Poorly edited.All this, plus, Mr. Byron sets the men's movement back 20 years with his male-bashing biological reductionism and stereotyping.Too bad. An insightful book on this topic is sorely needed. Anyone know of one?"
5,Bravo,Bravo to Chris Byron for finally telling the real story of these celebrity CEOs. The pillars that we placed these men on is chipping away and it is about time someone gave us another voice. Jack Welch and the men of GE should be ashamed of themselves. I found this book both entertaining and downright stunning at the same time. Read this book--you'll be shocked!
3,"Great cover, but inside mediocre","Although the author had some great material to work with, I found it a very one-sided viewpoint. I bought the book expecting ""dirt"" on these CEOs, but was still disappointed. Maybe it was the writing style or maybe the lack of balance, but I found myself questioning all of his assertions and statements when one footnote on page 100 said that Ronald Reagan was best known for hosting some TV show. His extensive documentation made me distrust his comments about these guys rather than making me trust that he researched the issues thoroughly. However, as one other reviewer mentioned, it was a nice break from all the self-aggrandizing business biographies."
5,excellent kids music - and parents like it too!,Finally some music my husband can listen too along with the kids. This is a great CD!
4,"Donald Sutherland takes off from A.Quinn in ""Lust for Life.""","Donald Sutherland takes us to the passion that Anthony Quinn showed us in ""Lust for Life."" This is an emotionally riveting movie that portrays the artist Paul Gauguin's discipline and emotion in portraying life on canvas. This movie reflects great cinematography, with the brilliance and haughtiness of an original Gauguin painting. Please re-release this video."
3,minnetonka slippers,Very disappointed with the quality. I returned them and ordered red wing slippers through chet's shoe store in Minnesota. I've had Minnetonka shoes in the past but was truly disappointed to see the quality so greatly reduced. I could have found the same at a Wal-Mart.
1,Don't Order From This Company,This company CHARGED my credit card for the slippers and DID NOT SHIP THEM. I am still waiting to get my money back!
1,Minnetonka sheepkin slipper,I can't rate something I never received. I was promised these slippers for Christmas for my wife. I didn't have a gift. Some Christmas. If you want me to rate this supplier I would give them a big fat 0.
3,Size,"This is the second pair that I purchased and unfortunately, they have changed the sizes. My old slippers were 6's and the new ones I ordered were 6. However, when I received them, they were too small. If I had known, I would have ordered a larger size. I guess I'll try to stretch them."
3,Not the Greatest for Me,"Toe box too narrow, heel too wide for my foot. Because sole is kind of stiff, slipper pistons up and down on heel with every step. No complaints about quality--just not a good fit for me. Easy, pain-free return w/quick refund."
1,Disappointed!,"If you spend 150 bucks on something it should be really decent, however I received this within a poorly packed box and missing the black part of the product, all I got is the metal thing which is less likely to be wrong on my own car, the black connector and controller is the thing I really want."
2,wrong size but good sound,"BBought it for a 87 Toyota supra .the inlet size wad not right.....adapter later, its on. Sounds good a small rumble when you gun it.it had a fart Canon on it beforehand"
4,Great Ideas!,This book gives the reader many ideas for practically using feng shui in the classroom. I am already reaping the benefits of a more balanced and focused student body as a result.
3,"Good ideas, but do they work?","I bought this book mainly for ideas on what to do with my classroom. But, I still keep wondering if they could work. As an educator and, first, a scholar, I can't help but give this whole Feng Shui a healthy bit of skepticism. What ever happened to basic design principles?"
3,Effort =A ; Result=C,"I was specifically looking for ways to arrange student desks in middle school, but what I got was advice to have students face eight different directions according to their gender and year of birth! The author said this could be accomplished with a seating chart and sticky notes."
4,Tantalizing Tetrazzini,For those of us who were not around to experience this brillian talent this CD is a wonderful look into the Golden Era of opera! Tetrazzini had a beautiful color to her voice and it is just magic to hear the way she flys up and down the scales like a little bird. If you have the chance I encourage you to experience Tetrazzini for yourself and I know you will love her just as much as I.
1,Great idea but not so great quality or customer service,"Its about time a cheaper alternative to the stokke chair came out. However, the customer service department at Hipposmile is quite difficult to contact and exasperating to deal with. The quality of the chairs have not been consistent and therefore you would be better off finding a store that carries the chair in Canada and taking a close look at the chair to make sure there is nothing wrong with it prior to your purchase. The risk of receiving an inferior quality chair is not worth the ensuing hassle of dealing with the company."
5,"Great Chairs, Great Price","These chairs are great! We have twin girls who have outgrown their high chairs, and the booster seats just weren't doing the trick....So we ordered two hipposmile chairs and the girls seem much more comfortable sitting at mealtime. And, given that we needed two chairs, we certainly appreciated the reasonable price."
2,You get what you pay for...,"I can provide a direct comparison of the Stokke and Hipposmile highchairs because I own both of them. The two chairs look basically identical though the Stokke is much sturdier and the pieces fit well together. The Hipposmile includes a seat cushion.Quality problems with the Hipposmile- uneven sides (chair doesn't lie flat to the ground)- during installation, the backboard cracked slightly from the thin wood. This was due to poor threading on the nut as it pushed against the backboard. Customer Service said it was the installer's fault and not a quality issue. Replacement board would cost $10 + delivery. I fixed it with tape instead. :)I bought it when it was on sale at $90. If you can pay a little more, I would go with the Stokke...you'll get back the difference when you sell it again. Otherwise, Hipposmile is a cheaper alternative."
3,It will work.,"Parts don't fit together quite correctly. Packaging is ok but some wood suffered from dents during shipping. I'd rather pay the $130.00 I paid for this than the Stokke it was modeled from, but be prepared for imperfection. The two steel poles included in mine are too short to fit properly without bowing the wood legs. A couple of black washers will fix this, but ideally I shouldnt need to make the parts fit myself. I would probably buy another one; as my daughter loves it and is much better than a regular high chair. However I think for the quality $130.00 is still too much money (but I wouldn't pay $230.00 for the stokke unless it were made from gold)."
5,"My kids love it, and so do I!","We love this seat! Our oldest has used it for a couple of years now, and it makes mealtime that much easier! We are getting a 2nd for our 24mth old now that she is able to climb in and sit properly at the table. My only *minimal* complaint involves the seat cushion - I find it tends to rotate around the seat after a half dozen meals or so... I just need to readjust it (not even having to undo the velcro though) to bring it back to perfect. I just wish cushion replacements were more readily available/affordable as we would like more of a colour choice."
3,My Twin Babies Loved This One Right Away But Jars Kept Arriving Broken,"I got the subscription and finally ended it after 7 occasions of broken jars in the delivery. I got tired of cleaning the mess and dealing with broken glass but the product is good even if watery.My babies love blueberries the most and over time they like pears and apples a lot too. This is a clear winner with them as it has only organic apples, organic blueberries and ascorbic acid. It's a great product.Be warned that your shipment could arrive sometimes with broken jars. I already said that! Over time I figured out it would cost the vendor too much to package these jars well enough to ensure no breakage. When a case arrived with one or more broken jars, I reported and got credited for the broken ones only. Of course it's messy when a jar is broken."
5,light and easy to eat...,my son was not feeling well (probably with a small cold) and the only thing he would eat is this one. Probably because it is light and easy for stomach. He refused other more rich-favor food but ate the whole jar of this.
1,not a good idea to order too many,"My son loves these, I ordered 1 box of bananas (12 bottles), 1 box of pears, 1 box of apples and blueberries. To my dismay, it arrived as 2 boxes of bananas ... the apples and blueberries were not delivered :(( Now I am stucked with so many bananas ... and then the inconvenience that I need to order apples and blueberries again separately since I dont think my son wants to eat that much bananas in a month!"
5,Yum yum!,"This stuff smells good, just opening the jar. My lil' babe loves it! I contemplated giving it one less star since I can now find it in my neighborhood store cheaper..."
1,Close Encounters of the Ridiculous Kind!,"Entertaining in the short term, but NO DURABILITY! The UFO flew once and then flew no more. I suppose it can still be utilized as a hand-held fan of sorts, but that was not its intended function. The battery will not charge as specified in the manual, if you can discern the meaning of the instructions at all. It seems that a rudimentary attempt was made to translate them into English. Perhaps they read more coherently in Chinese. While the UFO itself is of no entertainment after the first flight, the instruction manual may provide years of enjoyment! Save your Money!"
1,I want my money back,"This item was recommended by my boss, unfortunately the saucer lasted for 5 minutes. The blade broke, and was not repairable."
1,barely lasted a day,"This RC toy electric flying saucer UFO arrived in its box broken with parts missing. When it was finally replaced, it broke almost immediately. No educational value, no durability, a rip-off."
4,Great toy for fans of Sonic!,"This was a gift that keeps giving! The companion gift (Tails) was perftect. We plan to purchase the whole set, if we can get them all in the bed with my son!"
3,Better than Jazwares,"The Sonic toys they sell at Toys R Us by Jazwares break so easily and quickly! This one doesn't. For all of you who are pleading with the seller to come down on the price, I have one word for you - EBAY. That's where I bought my son's figure and it came with the stand, crystal rod and the gold colored ring. Obviously the seller here doesn't want to sell his figure...go to eBay and buy one there. I paid $20 for mine and it came with more than what this seller is offering. I wonder why Amazon even allows this to go on."
1,brother typewriter GX-6750,This is the worst typewriter i have ever used. very cheaply made. a piece has fallen off under the roller. cannot type avery labels on a 8 1/2 x 11 sheet it ruins the labels because they get caught in the carriage return. it deserves no stars at all.
1,TOO SLOW,I purchased this typewriter a few years ago and I really dislike it. I am a fast typer and the striker doesn't keep up with the speed at which I'm typing and it gets confusing to hear it strike after I've hit the keys. I feel as though I'm always waiting for the typewriter to catch up to me. The clear plastic paper holder doesn't do a good job of holding the page close enough to the carriage. There is no line guide so that whenever I want to type on a certain line on a page I'm either above the line or below it. And because I lost my owner's manual it took me some time to figure out how to get it out of the CAPS Lock mode. Other features as well are just too confusing for me. I'm looking for an IBM.
5,Great,"Really good for small typing projects, ie labels envelopes, form filling. Easy to use. Has good features. Seems to be sturdy."
3,Was a Christmas present for my Mom.,I brought it for her as a Christmas present. She is not computer computer and electronic savvy person. So she has not use the typewriter that I brought her.
3,Brother GX-6750 Daisy Wheel Electronic Typewriter,I purchased this for an 80 year old friend. She hasn't used it much yet. Only thing I didn't like about it was that you could not readily see what you had just typed. Perhaps we had not it adjusted it correctly. That happens when you are 75 and 80. She is going to work on it.
4,Nice Typewriter for the Average Person,"I am a very nostalgic person...thought my daughter would get a kick out of using a typewriter like the one I learned on in the 70's. Well, I bought this one for her and she loves it. Of course, it is very different typing on this as compared to a pc. It is also different than typing on a more expensive or more professional daisy wheel. For the price, it is a good typewriter and a good value."
3,wife's typewriter,"My wife has been using this brother-GX6750 almost everyday since I purchased it for minor office work, like forms etc. It works fine for this purpose but she still needs her PC for major reports. Before I got this typewriter she used an old IBM Selectric which she loved for it's speed...but it died on her and it was very heavy to move around.(Wife) I am enjoying this Brother GX-6750...everyday I get a little more used to it's slower speed."
4,Brother Typwriter,"I just use it for envelopes and short quick notes on the billings. Easy to use, quick, definitely worth the money, better than labels on the printer if there is just one addy and not likely to come up again.Plus, who knows how long typewriters will continue to be made and the Smith Corona is twice as much. One of my better purchases, envelopes drove me nutz on the computer."
1,Doesn't last long,"This typewriter lasted about four months before it started typing the wrong letters. Replaced the daisy wheel, but that didn't help. Every time it's turned off and back on again, the letters change."
1,Item Didn't even work,"the item arrived in un-working order. i'm not really sure what it's true capabilities were, as i never used it. the hammer didn't work."
1,Does not work properly,"I bought this for my 80-year-old mother, who is disabled and can't cope with a computer. Every time the typewriter is turned on, we find that it either types the wrong letter (press a Q, it prints an S; press E and get P, etc.) or else it prints the correct letter but they are not spaced correctly (some overlapping, some huge spaces). There is some esoteric combination of keystrokes that, supposedly, will reset the programming. But this is just too much for Mom. Also, every time it's turned on, you have to re-program the line spacing, the tabs and everything else. I ended up buying a 40-year-old manual typewriter on e-Bay and Mom is much happier with it."
4,Typewriter For Snail-Mail,"This typewriter was purchased for the writing of actual snail-mail letters, since I do not have a printer with my laptop. It does not have all the bells and whistles of an expensive typewriter but it has all I need for the simple writing of letters. The price was south of $100 (it might be the least expensive typewriter sold by Amazon) and when you figure in Amazon's Super Saver Shipping, the price cannot be beat. Recommended!"
4,does the intended job,This was purchased to do some casual typing inplace of the computer. Sometimes the computer is not accessible. This product works well for intended purpose
1,Dont waste your money on this toy.,"Poor reception, Won't stay locked on a station.You know the old saying ""You get what you pay for""It holds true here."
1,Too cheap to work,"I was pleased to find a radio for so cheap, but when I tried to use it, the radio was unable to stay locked on a station for very long. If you're in an area with several competing frequencies, it will jump up and down 1-2 MHz, or continue jumping up to the far end of the spectrum.It would be great if it worked, but I'm now going to pay $10 more and get a Coby CX90 that actually works. Save your $6 and don't get this."
2,Not really worth the $7.,"Relatively worthless piece of electronics:1. It doesn't stay tuned in to a station that's tuned in well enough to listen to.2. The fact that you can only tune with a single ""scan"" button (and a ""reset"" button which brings it back to 87.0 fm) makes it hard to tune it into something that you want to listen to that may be slightly out of tune.3. The sound just occasionally inexplicably cuts out. Tapping the unit sometimes works, but not always.Coby is usually unimpressive anyway. I'm going to look for a similarly cheap product from other brands, but I'm going to prepare to spend over $10 on it (since apparently $7 worth of electronics isn't enough)."
1,"Cheap, broke in 3 months","I experienced the same station-jumping that other users compained about. It just won't stick to a station. Also, mine broke after three months of light use. You get what you pay for."
2,not worth the money,"i bought this little radio for work. i tried it out at home first it was just ""ok"". when you find the station you want and you turn off the radio you have to do a search all over again to find your station. it will NOT return to the last station it was on. when i got to work with my new toy it did not work at all inside the building. what a waiste of money."
1,Are you KIDDING ME?? BAD JOKE!! VERY UNHAPPY BUYER~,"NOW WAY to STABILIZE a STATION! I NEED THAT MOST so I can use it as I work!Coby CX61 Mini FM Scanner Radio with Neck StrapCOBY CX61 POCKET FM SCAN RADIO WITH BACKLIT DIGITAL DISPLAY.. IS THERE any link or manual to REVEAL HOW TO work this little compact radio??PERFECT SIZE, BUT CANT HANDLE THE JUMPING STATIONS.... I hate to trash IT!"
1,Piece of Junk,"Radio will not hold station, keeps skipping around. Unusable & it is too bad because it is the perfect size & style-only one with neck lanyard. Cheap and still not worth it. Manufacturer does not respond to inquiries. Avoid Coby."
1,Worst POS I have bought in a long time,"It sounds pretty good as long as I didn't use the included ear bubs. But, you can only scan up and when you turn it off (which is very difficult as the volume control is inset so much) is does not come back to the same station. It changes stations when you unplug the ear bubs. After about 5 minutes o fuse, the on-off switch in the volume control became intermittent. The clock only works with the radio off so if you want to find out the time, turn the radio off, back on, and reset the station. POS is going back to the store. I have no idea what the battery life will be as I am not keeping it long enough."
2,"Not Bad, but Better Options are Available...","Bought this 2 years ago. Have used it a bit since. Main reason I bought it was because I bought a Craftsman Router at the same time (also a questionable decision, but ""Live and Learn"").This Box Joint system is OK, mothing more. At this price - it was $199 at Sears - you can make do with it (I would not pay more). User manual was a problem - it did not come with one. And getting the Customer Svc. folks to send me one was quite a chore (I had to make a ""warranty claim""). The manual itself is adequate, nothing more.After using it awhile (half blind, through joints, box joints) I can say that there are much better options out there - Leigh and Akeda come to mind. Festool makes a great system, but you need a Festool Router to go with it (granted, the Festool routers are rated very highly).As for this Craftsman Box Joint system, it is OK for limited use, but I would not reccommend it for any serious dovetail making environments.Good Luck."
1,Boring,"I'm not sure if this is for older children, but my 5 year old could not get involved with the story"
5,"On my personal ""Best-of-the-Best"" list","I love everything about this book. The vocabulary level is high for young children, but it works. The illustrations do such a good job of showing the context, and there is so little text on each page, that it's not at all frustrating to children. I'm sure it enriches their vocabularies. The stories are pleasingly unflashy -- quiet little stories about interesting animals and often about how people love and care for them. The illustrations are possibly the best I've ever seen in a children's book. I love reading this book to my grandchildren just for the pleasure it gives ME, let alone them!"
5,Wonderful stories and pictures to share,"A terrific book for any child who loves animals. The stories are great, and the illustrations are a pleasure to look at."
5,Lovely listen,A very sweet collection of stories. One of my all time favorites. James Herriot tells about the trials and triumphs of the life of a country vet and brings out the joys and happiness in his life.
4,A pleasure to read,"Growing up my family had a soft spot for animals. As we grew older my mom, brother and I passed around all the James Herriot books for grown ups and I vividly remember laughing and crying while reading them. I have two boys of my own who seem to have inherited the same love of animals. I was waiting for them to be a bit older before I began reading the James Herriots books that I saved through the years, since many of them are a little sad. Needless to say when I found this book, I was thrilled to find James Herriot's stories for children. There are only happy endings here. I love reading it to them and they seem eager to listen to each story. Most seem to start out with an animal in jeopardy and they eagerly anticipate what will happen to it and are always relieved to see a happy outcome. It does seem a little old fashioned compared to a lot of what's out there today, but that is definately part of the charm."
5,"James Herriots' stories, for children","I - we - love the James Herriot stories. This book has neat little stories lifted from his books and illustrated for children. The illustrations are very very good, and add beautiful imagery to the book. A good book for Dads to read the kids to sleep."
5,Wonderful stories!,James Herriot's stories read in a soothing but amusing voice. Anyone of any age who loves animals will enjoy this.
5,A Classic for Your Family,"My entire family LOVES this book! My kids, ages 7 and 5, ask for the stories over and over again. I love how warm the stories are, how colorful and vivid the illustrations are, how each story leaves a sweet affection for the animals and characters this vet has attended to. As a mom, I also love how this book has added words to my children's vocabulary, but without sacrificing the flow and ease of the stories. Each story takes 10-15 minutes to read, and my children are captivated by the story and the pictures for every second of that time. I recommend the book with no reservations to all families. This is not a ""read one time and be done with it"" book, but one you will keep coming back to. You will not regret this addition to your home library."
5,"Wonderful, warm stories for children and adults","Having read the entire series I had the pleasure to pass these wonderful, warm stories to my British grandchildren. They really enjoyed them. The illustrations are remarkable. Amazingly, we were able to visit the James Herriot Museum in Thirsk,Yorkshire, UK.(Although I know the he set the series in Harrogate, his practice was really in Thirsk). We spent hours there, lost in the vet surgery, immediate post WWII home, walking the garden, wandering around the barn. They offer ""hands on"" educational, interactive activities for children. If you are a fan and in northern England by all means go. But even if you can't the book is almost as good as being there. Great present for animal lovers of all ages!"
5,Settle in for a Great Read!,"James Harriot's story telling style conveys the life of an English country vet in vivid language at a pace that makes you and your little ones settle in for sheer enjoyment. His word choices connect with the reader on multiple levels engaging the mind and emotions. The illustrations are both beautifully realistic and immaginative. My children love the stories and frequently ask to hear them again. As a read aloud, it is appropriate from 3 years-old and up. Neither you nor they will ever tire of reading these stories."
3,Re-release of James Herriott treasury for children,"This book has beautiful pictures and is one of my favorites. All the kids I know love it. I highly recommend the book itself. However, it is a re-release of the book James Herriot's Treasury for Children. The Amazon website recommends buying the two books together, so I assumed they were different books. However, the copyright information for the Inspirational Stories book says clearly ""Previously published as James Herriot's Treasury for Children ..."""
5,Make a Memory with your Children,"This book is perfect for curling up with your children to read. One of the stories is Christmas-related and makes a lovely story to read the night before Christmas. The illustrations are beautiful and James Herriot is a master story-teller. You do not have to grow up in England or on a farm to appreciate his stories. If you love animals, you will love this book. My children look forward to cuddling up and reading another story with me and they are 8 and 11 year old boys! (But they love animal stories.)"
5,Herriott's always a good choice,"Purchased for an 11 year old, but possibly enjoyed even more by a younger group. All children that love animals will enjoy this book. It was especially touching for my granddaughter since she has recently lost a family dog that was in her home even before she was born. Can't go wrong with this wonderfully illustrated and written book."
5,Wonderful Book!,When my children were young a friend bought the stories in this book as single books for them. I was excited to see these in one book. The illustrations are terrific. Definitely a book to keep for generations!
5,A Beautiful Book,My children and I simply love this book. The pictures are so beautiful and the stories are told in a manner where you can just imagine sitting around a cozy fire while Grandpa tells his stories from days gone by. Any child who loves animals will find this book a delight.
5,Wonderful!,"I have loved James Herriot's stories for years. No child should be without this book. He's an excellent writer, and the drawings are top quality too. I especially love the story ""The Christmas Day Kitten"". This book is, of course, a must have!"
5,James Herriot's Treasury of Inspirational Stories for Children,Wonderful book which my grandchildren thoroughly enjoy. Each story provides excitement and emotional sensitivity. The reader's interest is captured and maintained from beginning to end.
5,"Good, used condition.",The used copy was in good condition. We love this book. It's a family favorite. Every child should own it; especially animal lovers of any kind.
5,James Herriot's story helps kids learn to read,"My little Shetland sheepdog and I do Therapy Dog work. Whenever we have an older child who needs a bit of help learning to read, I pull out this treasury of James Herriot's tales. The stories are suitable for almost everybody except the youngest readers (they are a bit long for them to read, although they are very suitable for parents to read to little ones). Heart warming, well illustrated, these stories are suitable for 3rd grade level and up readers to enjoy. Adults can also enjoy these stories with their kids."
4,Great book,This book was a gift for my so. And he loved it. Great pictures and wonderful stories I would highly recommend it.
5,Great read.,WE got this for our granddaughter after she had had surgery. She liked it and read them right through. Great way to help take her mind off hurting.
1,Junk.,"I spooled up a brand new rod and reel with 20lb Fireline. On my second cast I had a minor backlash, which was easily fixed. However, on the third cast, the line broke right off, right where the backlash had been, and sent my brand new Rap Shad flying out into the middle of the river. Sayonara $6.I've used braid before, and never seen any fishing line this fragile. I immediately stripped all the Fireline off the reel and threw it and the remaining spool of Fireline in the garbage. I'll never use it again."
2,Fireline Online,"Not a bad price for Fireline, but I didn't get the strength I asked for. Couldn't find how to be more specific as to which pound test I would get, so I returned it. Easy return, no glitches."
3,Needs digital restoration,John Charles Thomas had a wonderful voice. His memory would be better served with a digital restoration of this classic album.
1,Not Recommended,"I was very disappointed with this book. It depicts a selfish grand-stander who, in my opinion, is an embarrassment to the Corp. This is why his service has been relegated to the margins of military history--not easy to do for a Medal of Honor winner. ""Honor"" is one of the central core values of the Marine Corp.""Marines are held to the highest standards, ethically and morally. Respect for others is essential. Marines are expected to act responsibly in a manner befitting the title they've earned."" --from [...]Mr. Lucas exhibited no honor. His life is more an example of how not to live. He was, no doubt, negatively affected by his childhood. What kind of family sends a 14 year old off to war? I know it was a different era of American culture, but his parents had to sign him up--and lie to do it. The enemy was not yet at the gate.Still, I have to commend him for his courage.Semper Fi!"
2,212 Pages of Self-Praise,"Mr. Lucas has just spent 212 pages doing nothing more than patting himself on the back and telling the public how big a hero he is. He also spends a great amount of time in stating how he relishes the limelight he is in and will go to any length to exploit the Medal of Honor to his own use. From some of key phrases in the book, the reader would think he was the only Marine on Iwo Jima. While I highly respect him for the action for which the medal was awarded, I do not respect the idea of using it to ones advantage. The author also seems to think that what he cannot accomplish with the Medal of Honor around his neck, his two fist will get for him."
2,Ok but lacking overall,"A little more story about the battle, or the progression through the Corps would have been nice. Instead, the story centered around girls, drinking, and getting into trouble. Entertaining, but not historically relevant."
4,Good tips,"This might not be among the most comprehensive books out there dealing with analog design but, here the author includes something that many don't - he gives design tips. It is good once in a while being reminded about what is important. However, a big minus in this book is the language. I understand that the author is not a native English speaker but, Kluwer must have done something about it. It seems as though they just took the manuscript and printed it without reading/correcting it - which is a pity because their books are expensive, and in this case one wonders about where the quality is vis-à-vis the price. Well, for me, I frequently needed to read the text more than once to understand what the author is trying to convey. But this flaw is not related to the technical content of the book. The author's experience in the field is reflected in the technical details."
3,Not worth the price,"Although this little book has some helpful reference material, I was hugely disappointed. It is not worth the $20 that I paid for it."
2,Beautiful but fragile.,"I think it's a very beautiful product, but after a month use it got broken and can't be fixed. Well, for that price we can't expect an excellent quality product..."
5,Another great one!,"Doty is quite possibly the best author of young adult ""horsey"" books! Like her others, I first read ""The Crumb"" when I was about ten and even then it struck me as something unusual. She reaches beyond the usual ""girl loves horses"" story and pulls out emotions and depth that are rare in horse fiction, especially for young adults. ""The Crumb"" is perhaps the finest example of the perfect fiction book for anyone!"
2,Interesting but Quick Read about the Tonya/Nancy Debacle,"This book was hastily churned out at the height of the Tonya/Nancy knee-whacking incident as a quick money maker for the author and publisher. The problem with this book is that it is not a well-rounded biography of Tonya; the emphasis is too much on the knee-whacking incident and shortly thereafter, stopping just before the '94 Winter Games. It is an interesting collectible for Tonya-philes, but does not give a full portrait of the talented, complex, troubled young woman. Hopefully a more comprehensive biography of Ms. Harding will be available in the future."
4,Fair and unbiased account of this talented athlete,"Unlike other purported ""bios"" of Tonya and Nancy, these writers obviously took the time to interview those close to the skaters rather than depending on news stories for their material. Their attention to detail and the interesting details of backstage life in the fast-paced world of international figure skating make this an interesting read."
4,Kid's Power Fun for Little ones - Computer Games,"My 5 year old grandson is captivated by the ""Brother Bear"" game contained on the CD. There are times he needs some help in managing the computer skills needed to complete some of the moves but for the most part he can handle it. His two year old brother loves to watch him play the game and asks him to repeat certain games within the game. The rest of the games included are somewhat boring for the 5 year old and the two year old doesn't have the skills needed to play the games but loves to watch when I ""play"" the Putt Putt game included on the disc. Neither child seems to be very interested in the other two offerings, but the ""Brother Bear"" game makes it a worthwhile purchase. His father sat down to help one night and we couldn't get him to quit playing - appeals to a wide age range:)!"
2,Very Lacking on the Specific Subject of the Book,"This book contains a lot of good info on general dog care; however, that's not the kind of book I wanted.Maybe 30 pages out of 200+ are actually about the specific breed rather than dogs in general."
1,disaster...,"This is probably one of the worst of all books about ACDs (although some others may qualify as well). Unusable information, combined with pictures of similar quality...a complete waste of money. Instead, add a few $$ and go for John&Mary Holmes."
4,A great first resource for the new or soon-to-be ACD owner.,"So what is it? A Blue Heeler, a Red Heeler, a Heeler, a Queensland Heeler? Not to be confused with an Australian Shepherd!This book covers a lot of ground in a small package. A good book for the first time ACD owner, or for someone who is thinking about getting an ACD! It gives the history of the Australian Cattle Dog, hints and tips on caring for your ACD, what to expect, and even covers some basic obedience training. The section on behavior is particularly important. Narelle Robertson is owned by ACD's, so she speaks from experience! Get this book today."
3,Australian Cattle Dogs by Narelle Robertson,"It explains the origins of the Australian Cattle Dog quite well,but the rest of the book is very vague on training specificallyan ACD and also half of the book is for dog food, toy, trainingtool advertisements. Really didn't get much out of it exceptfor the great pictures."
2,wobbles,"I got this pan in penne (ugly yellow, but it's growing on me) while it was deeply discounted. I would have liked to get a 4-6 qt dutch oven from Staub, Le Creuset or even Batali but this was relatively free.I like the brushed brass look of the knob on the lid better than either the plastic Le Creuset or the chrome Staub. The enamel on the penne seems somewhat matte as opposed to glossy. Some may prefer this but some may think it looks cheap/unfinished. The interior enamel looks like on the Le Creuset (glossy white). One serious complaint I have is that this pan did not sit flat fresh out of the box. For glass top stoves this means uneven heating. For this reason I rated it only two stars on a scale where Le Creuset is 4 and Staub is 5. If it didn't wobble I'd give it 3.5 stars."
2,Poorly written,"Book is poorly written and edited. At times, the writer goes astray and describes people or moments that we nothing about."
2,Remedial C++ for engineers,"The book gives a very simplified view of the C++ language. Almost everything in it does not exploit features specific to C++. Where the book might excel is giving some basic routines that scientist and engineers use, but alas it give simple algorithms that would are not very efficent. I would recommend getting a book to really learn the C++ language or a book to learn numerical algorithms. By trying to do both this book fails."
3,Swimming in packin peanuts!!!!!,"Seriously I filed 4 giant black yard bags with them. Be very careful where you unpack the table because if you are dumb enough (like me) to uncrate the table in the yard, be prepared to be chasing peanuts for hours.........As fot the actual table: Nicely constructed with the exception of the drop leaf supports which require the aid of a mallet to either extend or redraw them after use. I asume over time the wood will shrink and make this not such an arduous task. Cute space saving design"
1,Know the Truth about this Book,"This book has serious problems both with accuracy and with scholarly integrity. Certainly, readers who know nothing of German-American history can learn important information from reading the book, but it is badly outdated, wrong in too many instances, and much of it is copied from an older work. Read the details in the H-Net review: [...]"
1,Don't buy this one!,"My daughter purchased one of these for me. I have had three different sharpeners of this type, but this one was the worst by far. At first, it did a great job, but after about ten sharpenings almost all the diamond dust is worn off. I have gone back to an Eze-Lap 8"" round sharpener that I have had for about five years. Much of the dust is worn off this sharpener also, but only after hundreds of knives being sharpened. I will but another of these and never switch again."
4,"Good value, but not all you'll need","This DMT diamond rod fills a niche between a sharpening steel (for daily edge realignment) and a whetstone (for wholesale metal removal to recreate the edge). It's easy to hold properly, takes off a little bit of metal on each stroke so it's easy to control, and you use it dry so it's not messy. This tool is relatively inexpensive and solidly made in USA. I've used mine on about 10 knives (12' of edge) and it shows no sign of diamond loss, so I'm hopeful it'll last a good while.The 600 grit version creates an edge that I find to be too coarse, even after touching up with a sharpening steel. If you like your edges smooth and sharp (like a razor) rather than micro-jaggy (like a very fine breadknife), you'll need a fine stone to finish or might consider the 1200 grit version instead."
4,"Good honer, might want something finer for a sharper edge","This honer will keep your knife sharp, but if you want to keep your knife ridiculously sharp, you should look at their finer grit steels (either the extra fine diamond steel or the ceramic steel)."
1,Diamond Steels,"I bought the DMT in both the Fine Grit and the Extra Fine Grit. The Extra Fine Grit is quite nice, and I would give it 4 Stars. But, the Fine Grit had flaws. There were imperfections along the rod that would actually catch the knife blade and prevent it from moving down the rod. I played around with it ( with a knife that I didn't care about ! ), and found about half a dozen places that caught the knife. I returned it and just ordered a Fischer Bargoin. We'll see how this new one performs."
4,rody horse,"ibought this for my niece for christmas,but all the kids seemed to like bouncing on it. I just wish the would have said the weight limit, because the rody max gives a weight limit, but this doesn't."
4,Great fun toy!,"I got this for my 1 1/2 year old for Christmas. She screamed from excitement when she first saw it. It was all fun and smiles from day one and still loves it every time she sees it and hops on it.Definately helps with balance and coordination since it requires them to use their legs to stay atop.Again, this is definitely a must have if you want to get a laugh and smile from watching your kid play."
3,Just okay!,"Thankfully this was purchased for our 2 year old and not our 5 year old. It is smaller than I expected. My two year old has a good time bouncing on it and has not tipped over, BUT honestly its just an okay toy. I do like that it has no batteries and the boys use Rody for other things like a monster horse attacking army men. I am surprised by all the 4 and 5 star reviews of this toy. Maybe if it was bigger I would have given it a better review."
2,Wrong Description on Height & # 3 plastic,"The saddle height of this Rody is less than 10 inches. The description states that it inflates to a 12 inch saddle height, which I believe is the larger Rody; the one we wanted. It also is made of #3 plastic for those of you concerned about the dangerous plastics that are being used in our children's toys. They do state that they use no banned phthalates chemicals. I guess #3 is not banned however I've read to only have ""4,5, 1, & 2 all the rest are bad for you"". Your choice just thought I would let you know. My kids love the Rody at their play group and it is very sturdy...too bad it didn't work out, I was really excited about this toy... :("
4,great toy,"good quality toy for a reasonable price. We've tried other bouncy toys that don't bounce very well, but this one bounces very well - my 3 yr old son loves it. Good quality construction. Its great for gross motor skill development too."
4,2-1/2-Year-Old Loves It,"Our 2-1/2-year old son loves this toy. He loves bouncing around the house and quickly mastered it. It's a little small for him, but he's near the maxiumum age and he's also big for his size. The design is really cute. He loves talking to it, and keeps it near his bed at night. The construction is very durable (at least the membrane is very thick and appears nearly puncture proof)."
4,Recommended by Children's Hospital Therapist,My toddler is in occupational therapy and needed somthing to work with for her legs and this was a winner all the way around. Plus for the price it will last for my next baby. Love it and she does too!
5,"Unique, fun and durable","This is a very fun toy! My kids both love it and still use it, a year later!"
4,Expensive but fun,"My 2 year old is still a little too uncoordinated to stay on this long, but because it is so close to the ground, she doesn't get hurt when she tips over or falls off (and we have hardwood floors). I think as she gets bigger she will love it even more. You can adjust the amount of air inside for bigger or smaller kids, so really it could grow with your kids. It was even a hit with the adults at Christmas (the weight limit is 400lbs!), and we had some good laughs out of that. It is an expensive gift (or maybe I'm just cheap) but it is built of really durable thick plastic and I think it will last a long time, which makes it worth the price."
4,Great fun,"We bought this for our daughter, and she has a love/hate relationship with it, because she's a little too short to get on and off by herself. Buy the base as well."
5,Rody Horse,"this was such a great hit with our little one - his favorite thing to play with, worth every dime"
2,Much Smaller than anticipated.,"I bought this for my grandson on his 4th birthday. Even though it says it's for 3-6 year olds, don't believe it. He is a small four year old and it was woefully small for him to sit on. And forget bouncing on it. He just carries it around for a pet instead. I'm disappointed to say the least. That was an expensive mistake."
4,One of the keepers...,"I skeptically purchased this for my daughter who had just turned 2 years old last Christmas. We got the rocker base (which is way too overpriced in my opinion) with it and I have to say this has outlasted the other toys from the same time. It's VERY durable and can take a lot of toddler abuse. It can also become a pretend pet, a jumper, and a rocker. This horse has worn everything from a superhero cape to a princess crown and still looks brand new. Very happy with the purchase. He does look a little crazed, but you get over it soon enough. :)"
2,Fun for a few minutes,"My wife bought this for our 23 month year old and she loved it right out of the box. Over the past week I have noticed she only gets on it for a few minutes. I wouldn't buy this again, although I think if you have more than one child it would be more fun for them to play with. It is solid construction and doesn't seem to lose air. Might be worth spending your 50 odd bucks on some books."
5,Great purchase - lots of fun,My daughter loves the Rody Horse! Even she's not able to really hop around with it yet she has a lot of fun sitting on it and try to hop. Inside the house and outside on the lawn the Rody is very durable. The only thing which is quite difficult to handle: the plug at the bag of the Rody to refill it with air is really hard to remove. But overall a great idea to buy this horse!
2,Grandson Not Interested in Rody,"Based on very positive reviews, we bought the Rody for our grandson's second birthday. We felt sure he'd like it because he's so active--loves to run and jump. He tried half-heartedly to ride it at first, but now he says ""no"" every time we try to put him on the horse. He's hugged it a few times, but that's the extent of his interest. It was a lot of money to pay for no play value."
2,Rody Horse,The smell of its (plastic) really strong and it lasts for a long long time. The smell made me have headache. I hate its smell. But I am so lazy to return it.
5,One super little horse,"This little horse was purchased for a first birthday and has been very well loved. While he doesn't see much time trotting around, he's been fun to feed plastic food and to give lots of hugs. We highly recommend this great little fella."
5,Great Toy,Bought this for our daughter and she loves it!! Super cool looking and durable. So many colors to choose from make this a great gift for any child.
2,Cool idea..BUT!,"My 2 1/2 yr old was delighted when we suprised her with this toy! She got right on, and in seconds we watched her fall forward and hit her head. She was scared, so my older kids tried to show her and they had a hard time too. So sad to return it."
4,Great Indoor Toy,"We bought 3 of these for my 3 year old's birthday party for ""horse races."" And they were/are a huge hit. All of our friends want them now also! They were durable enough that even the 8 year old kids bounced around on them also, but I wouldn't promote that on a daily basis. This is a great ""indoor"" toy to have for exercise when you live in a hot climate like we do, or for rainy days! I am sure this will become a popular gift giver for us! Enjoy"
4,Bouncy horsie,"I bought 2 of these for my grandsons who are 2 and 4. The toy is very cute and inviting to play with. The parents and I had a good chuckle, because the air goes in (or comes out), ahem, well, where the ""air"" comes out of a real horse. The kids got on their ponies and rode them across the living room, and loved them until the orange one got frisky and bucked the older boy off. It took a while for him to buck up his courage and get back on the horse that threw him. The horses fit nicely in a stable under an end table, between gallops across the carpet. One of them, however, is developing a ""tumor"" on one of its hips which looks like it may eventually rupture. There is probably not a vet available to heal a blow-up plastic horsie."
2,Rody,Cute toy. Our daughter loves it but our Rody's back is pushed out/stretched out too far on one side and is hard for her to sit on it.
4,A bouncy toy,This thing can support a lot of weight. Kid gets on it and bounces. That's about it. If you're looking for a bouncy thing for your kid to ride then you've found it.
5,Wish I had one when I was little....,"We bought a Rody horse when my little boy was almost 1. At first he would ride it kind of slow, but then the excitement built. It ended up we had to play the Rody video ad on YouTube every time he rode it. Great product, and even dad (me) can sit on it and make it go (with my knees hitting the floor of course).Most people suggest getting the air pump. I had a compressor, and with quick hands had no problem getting the plug in after airing it up with the inflatable ball attachment from my compressor."
5,She likes it!,"Gave this to my granddaughter for her third birthday. I think it's a hit. She and her five year old sister took right off hopping like crazy(taking turns of course). After a while she smiled and said ""I like this present"". Their 18 month old brother likes it too although it is a little too big for him. Time will tell how well it holds up but it appears to be very thick and should hold up well."
3,Rody Bouncy Hors,"I was super excited to get this for my 16 month old daughter but didn't realize how hard it would be to blow up manually without buying the special pump. Also, there was only 1 plug to stop the airflow in the horse & think it should come with a few more plugs or be available to purchase seperately."
3,Eh,"Very cute toy with a very strong odor. An odor that I can't really describe--sort of like a very strong combination of vanilla and cupcakes, but it's a but overwhelming at times.My toddler doesn't seem to care about the smell. I would recommend keeping this in a carpeted area. Even when the Rody is completely pumped, it's ""feet"" will sometimes collapse and push air into the rest of the horse. Example: my toddler leaned forward and slightly to the right while not even bouncing, and was promptly flipped over on the floor. Not a big deal, really. But I imagine if this toy were used on harder surfaces that initial face plant wouldn't be received very well when your child is still learning how to balance on the Rody."
5,perfect gift,"perfect gift for an active 2 year old! And she's still playing with it 3 weeks later, as is my 5 year old."
5,Super fun,We got this for our 2 year old daughter for Christmas and she loves it! She is still abut wobbly on it but it will help her with her core strength and she still has plenty of room to grow into it.
3,Toy is small for 4-5 year old-but fun-VERY SMELLY,"I bought this for my 3 year's birthday. She loves it. My 4, almost 5 year old tried it, it is too small for him. His legs are really bunched up on it. My major problem with this toy is the chemical smell. We had to keep it outside for almost a week and it still has an odor about it. Not happy with that aspect. But the toy for my girl is great."
5,She loves it!,My 2 yr old has loved this toy! She saw it in a store and did not want to get off it. Her older brothers (11 yrs old) get on the back of it with her and bounce her up and down! All our kids love it really. I always catch the 7 year old on it just bouncing away! It's very sturdy too!
4,Hopping and Hopping,"My three-year old son loves this! He used to bounce on his Fisher Price zebra, but outgrew it and was bottoming out on it. This one is for ages 3 and up and we love that it's quiet, portable and soft to bounce on. It seems a bit small for the age rating, but that doesn't seem to bother my son."
3,I probably should have gone for the traditional bouncy ball...,"I had some misgivings picking this out for my daughter's 3rd birthday--it just didn't seem big enough. (Granted, she is about the height of an average 4 year old now...) It just seemed the toy was meant for younger children, but the box said it wasn't for children under 3, and the sales lady told me that ""of course"" older children like them too! I have to say that my 9 year old boys love it--and it is sturdy enough for them to wrestle over it, and try to knock each other off. As far as my daughter bouncing on it though, her legs are just long enough, and the bounce on four legs is just awkward enough to be almost dangerous if she gets bucked off. For the price, if I could make a different choice, I would. For her second birthday--may have been perfect. For her 3rd though...I should have gone for the ball."
5,Best toy ever made!,My oldest daughter got one from her Aunt. I have bought one every year for my nieces & nephews! My 6ft husband can ride the little one. We have since upgraded and bought our girls the Rody Max! Highly recommended for a boy or girl! We all love it!
3,"Most complete GA dictionary, but confusing.","Odd dictionary, which uses arabic letters for each of the gulf arabic roots, which is a problem for learners non-readers of Arabic. This does also lead to confusion - jiim, for example, is used both for words containing classical jiim and classical qaaf. This would be fair if there wasn't a good degree of flexibility in ""Gulf Arabic"". Personally I find it confusing. I find Dr. Qafisheh's previous ""Glossary of Gulf Arabic"" (pub. Librairie du Liban) more useful esp. as it is GA-English and English-GA, but this new work is more complete."
2,It was OK....,"with some very humorous moments....but a slow and plodding script at points...the acting was fairly good...I thought the script was lacking, though, and you can never overcome that. Sort of a ""desperate for a zombie flick"" rental."
3,"Not funny, too much gore","Not a bad film, but not good either. While the acting was fine, the script was not. This movie used sociopolitical statements and tried to turn them into jokes and most them went over like a lead balloon. There are a few good moments in the movie, just not enough. There is way too much gore and blood splatter, it got old fast. This movie could have been much funnier, but it isn't a total loss. Don't expect it to be an award winning movie and you just might enjoy it."
4,Great Zombie Movie,"It's 2:31 a.m and i'm on my computer at the Epix website. This insomniac is in the mood to watch a horror movie and I come across ""Zombies of Mass Destruction"". Was this the best or worse zombie movie ever made? No. It's dramatic, comical, cheesy and gory all rolled into one. I thought it was great and very entertaining. I just might add it to my dvd collection. I'm also loving ""The Frida Song"" which rocks!"
3,As funny as Michael Moore,"...which is to say, not really all that much, but has its moments. So you can fully ignore the cover promise that it is funny as.....nope. Not a bad film but way too, too many policitcal agenda gripes get in the way of this being a zombie film, at least one with the nature most of us watch zombie films for. I'd rent or wait for the Wally-World $5 reduction bin before you purchase. It is not bad, and is one I'll watch more than once - but it is ""slow night"" material, it just was not worth the full retail price. Where I give it 3 stars, is the acting of the female lead and what I thought was a good job in the red-neck element as far as some paranoia that you really Do see live and healthy these days."
2,boring,"I'm half way through this book, it's nothing but girls going shopping. I thought she was going off to space, it is taking way too long for the plot to get interesting. I think Moore was trying to really paint the time and setting, but he is taking too long to make it interesting."
4,Great,Was shipped in a timely manner and the product arrived as specified. No damages or unusual wear and tear either from shipping or storage! A+
3,Graphic SF Reader,"The Ballad of Halo Jones didn't thrill me a lot, maybe I had read too many books that this was reminiscent of that were quite frankly, a lot better.Halo is a poor girl on a planet that likes to use the American style move the poor somewhere else manoeuvre to claim they have no poverty. That sort of thing. So, a bit of Reagan era commentary.Anyway, she escapes into space, and has to try and stay alive, especially when ending up in the military."
4,Halo Jones - a strong beginning that ends too soon,"A unique and intriguing serialized vision of the future - and very feminist, to boot. This is the story of Halo Jones, common woman of the far future, from late adolescence to...well...about thirty. What starts off quirky but slightly irritating (the ""hoop slang"" of the first storyline is as bad as any Mad Max-style futuristic film) actually becomes really fascinating in the third and final storyline, roughly halfway through the book, as Halo finds herself a soldier in wartime. It's the most direct science fiction Alan Moore's ever done, and possibly the most disappointingly unfinished project, too; what should have (and probably would have) been an epic ""ballad"" of nine storylines and Halo's full adulthood was cut short at three, so it does leave the reader with a real ""Now what?"" feeling. Oh well. At least what was published turned out this good."
5,Eerie!!!,"I love to read Timothy Green Beckley's books late at night, and that goes especially for this one. Each story gets better than the last one! He is one of the most underrated authors of our time. Mr. Beckley ranks right up there with John Keel, and Brad Steiger. His stories about UFO's and their occupants always run chills up my spine! He is one of the few investigators that visits the scene(s) and knows how to report it in a way that that is truly classic. I would love to see him write movie scripts for Science Fiction!"
3,Mysticism that young adolescent might enjoy...,"Although the main character in this book is of high school age, I do not recommend this book for secondary school students. I think that the moderate level of character development and ""magic"" plot is more on the level of younger adolescents. It is also my opinion that high schoolers will be disinterested in the mysterious and unexplained psychic episodes that Mandy experiences in the story. However, I believe that middle level students might enjoy this story and the mysticism that it contains. But remember, I stress that you should read this book yourself to make up your own mind."
5,Captivating!,"Mandy is blind at 15...her mother dead. Mandy moved around all her life with her adopted mother. One day her mum finally decided to find Margaret, her birth mother. She went to the store, bought fancy paper, and was pulling out of the parking lot while fastening her seatbelt when the crash happened. Mandy was blinded. Karen was killed. Mandy now lives with Margaret's brothers, Abe and Gabriel, and Gabriel's wife, Emma. She can go to the fresh lace curtains and see her great-uncle Abe's and great-uncle Gabriel's life...along with Margaret, called Gwen. Gwen's mother doesn't seem to love her. Gwen marries Paul, a salesman, and leaves...never seeing her mum again. Abe never gets over it, never seeing Gwen. Meanwhile, Mandy has made a new friend Hannah and shared her secret, got a bf, Ted, who is partly deaf, and is facing normal High School life."
4,good for hydration,I originally got this for a FACE cream. Can you really beat this price for how much you get since I live in the desert I have combination skin and the weather takes the water out of my skin but leaves the oil so this is good
4,A past life can haunt you forever,"Monkey King, by Patricia Chao was the best novel I have ever read. It talks about a girl name Sally who was raped by her own father, that she loves. And how she lives on with her life, what she has to go through with her bad memory of her father. That keep haunting her through her life. This book talks about how Chinese have their own belief and Reputation. This book will make you keep reading and wondering what will happen next. And did Sally actually reveal her family's darkest secret? I would recommand all of you to read this book."
2,Depressing,"There was nothing uplifting about this story. It is such a long and sad book about a Chinese American woman who didn't seem to resolve childhood issues of sibling rivalry or incest. Granted, many of the characters are colorful and realistic. However, the writing at the end of the book leaves the reader just a bit confused. So, was it another suicide attempt or was she recalling her previous attempt"
1,twisted...,"Am I the only person that felt this book was twisted, disjointed, and something was just not working? The beginning was great but the second half left a lot to be desired. This could have been a great story, the author veered off track or something."
5,A captivating novel,"I just finished Monkey King and I have to say it's one of the best and most original books I've ever read. Patricia Chao has an incredible talent of bringing the reader along on the protagonist's journey so that you feel like you're experiencing every emotion, sound and touch first-hand. I think this was particularly important since the protagonist, Sally, is an artist and her senses are naturally acute. I was impressed that Chao did not make Sally paralyzed by her depression. Rather, I perceived Sally as emotionally stunted by her childhood trauma, but through intense self-analysis was finally able to play ""emotional catch-up."" I also really appreciated how Chao captured Sally's hunger for parental approval, a theme that most people can identify with regardless of their age or station in life."
5,this book is excellent,"This book is immersive. I picked it up and didn't put it down for the six hours it took me to read it. It's well-written, in a sort of matter-of-fact style that lets you inside the narrator's head with the saccharine melodrama that tends to be enemy number one in this genre.The characters are extremely well fleshed out, and you end up really caring about (and being somewhat exasperated with) the narrator.It just generally kicks butt."
2,"Well-written, but ultimately unsatisfying","Although the writing is wonderful, the content leaves you wondering what is missing. The big messy secret in Sally's life is the nature of her relationship with her late father. This is always hovering in the background and is obviously one of the roots of her current problems. However, there is little substance in how she works these problems out"
2,Don't bother,ProsLooks cool...Neat light on the end...ConsTo loud to use at work...Blows about as much air as I expected...Doesn't stay up on it's own very well...
4,Cool Heat,"5 stars if the engineering would have been better. Might be the limitations of live recordings. Nonetheless, an excellent disc. Junior Watson is in great form with the others also playing fine. A few more cuts should have been added."
1,*yawn*,"The books that I didn't finish are few and far between, but this one is going on the list. Usually I try to give a book at least a hundred pages, but this one was such a snooze I had to set it aside.As a long time space buff, it takes a lot to turn me off from anything about the space program, but this one isn't really about the space program. It's a romance novel, and a poorly written one at that. An entire page is spent describing the check-out line at a Luby's diner in tedious detail.It would have been more fun to go outside and watch my grass grow. Stephen Harrigan owes me 45 minutes of my life back."
2,Not nearly as good as the industry reviews claim.,"When the New York Times Book Review talks about ""emotional precision"" and ""the exactitude of its prose"", I don't expect to be unimpressed, but this book has little suspense and no emotional content. The ""affair"" is unexciting and anticlimactic and the ending is abrupt and unsatisfying. I never truly cared about the main characters, nor could I relate to Lucy, perhaps because her point of view was being explored by a man in a bold but unsuccessful effort."
2,Disappointed.,"If you are a space fan like me, the cover of this book caught your eye. The title, the astronaut in the launch and entry suit, this book was bound to be great. But as the saying goes, ""never judge a book...""Sad to say ""Challenger Park"" never quite lives up to expectations. The reader is not treated to a believable view of the life of an astronaut. Which is disappointing considering that the author has done considerable research and spoken with actual astronauts. Indeed the reader will find those factual nuggets that suggest the author was privy to insider information. There's just not enough here in this book. I imagine space travel and the events leading up to it to be exciting enough without the need to wrap a rookie astronauts first flight around an illicit romance."
2,"A slow, plotless read","I'm giving Challenger Park two stars because the writing is good, but the story is bad. There is no real plot, and nothing happens until 3/4 of the way in. The last paragraph, however, is the best of the entire book - not because it solves any plot(less) issues, but because it's just a nice slice of writing. So read the last paragraph at your library and don't bother with the rest of the book."
4,"Very nice, but don't read it on Kindle","I said goodbye to paper books a while ago and never looked back.In this case I would absolutely recommend reading it either on paper or in PDF, and not on the Kindle: the book uses a lot of typographic cues as to what is going on, which makes it a lot harder to follow when you have just the text.That being said, it's an interesting counterpart to Acts of the Apostles and I'm looking forward to reading the third part of the trilogy."
4,My 7 & 4 year olds love these,My children love the Dukes of Hazzard. The toys are hard to come by. We looked all over for Dukes of Hazzard stuff and never could find any. When I discovered them on here I was so excited. It was a great surprise for my 7 year old when he opened these at christmas.
5,Magnificent!,"This wonderful artist has always touched my heart, and this is an exceptional recording."
4,"Pardon the cliche, but this album rocks!","This album has some of my favorite Muddy tunes. I almost get the feeling of being there. You can hear them having a good time jamming together, and you get a chance to hear Pinetop do a little singin' too. The quicker tunes are my favorite especially Caldonia and Kansas City. It makes me feel like I'm sipping Jackn'Coke in a bar. Makes me wanna dance."
3,"(3.5 stars, better than I had expected","For a long time I had delayed buying this CD because of all the bad reviews of it I read. Finally I bought it and you know what, it's a good CD.This album finds Muddy branching out a bit and trying a different sound. Many tracks have more of a R&B feel than a Chicago blues feel. There is also some accordion, which gives some tracks a Cajun/Louisiana groove.The musicianship is great. Muddy voice and guitar are in top shape, but I found Paul Butterfield's harp to be a bit trebly.There is also cool organ on some tracks.While this may not be the place to start a Muddy collection, but if you have all the earlier Chess stuff, the CBS/Blue Sky stuff and still want more, it's definitely worth a shot."
5,Muddy's Woodstock Album is a delightful must!,"By 1975 Muddy Waters had already been playing the blues for about forty years. He would unfortunately have only eight years left until his passing but what he managed to achieve this late in his career was no small feat. And it begins here with The Woodstock Album which was the brainchild of The Band's Levon Helm and 'his mentor' Henry Glover.Recorded in the winter of '75 - with Muddy's sidemen Bob Margolin on guitar and Pinetop Perkins on piano plus Levon on drums; The Band's Garth Hudson on organ, accordion and saxophone; Paul Butterfield on harmonica; Fred Carter on bass and guitar; and Howard Johnson on saxophone - this album feels relaxed and spontaneous while keeping the blues very much in its core.As a result, Muddy got his second Grammy Award something which surely revitalised his career and made way for his also brilliant partnership with Johnny Winter the following year."
2,not true Muddy,"This album was a disappointment. I was looking forward to Muddy's covers of ""Caldoinia"" and ""Kansas City"" but it wasnt what I thought itd be. Dont get me wrong, Muddy himself was fine, but he gets overshadowed by the musical collaborators. There is an overuse of harmonica and organ, and the annoying presence of ACCORDIAN! Accordians and Waters do not mix. This over-instrumentalization leaves the album sounding lame and folky and not bluesy. If you're looking for Muddy's later work, try ""Blues Sky"", with Muddy working with Johnny Winter and his back to basics production."
2,The calm before the storm.,"This is not Muddy at his best. Another attempt to change his sound. In spite of the efforts of a couple of members of The Band, it comes across as a weak effort. I can't believe it won a grammy. The upside is Johnny Winter and ""hard again"" were just around the corner! Avoid this. You won't play it much if you do own it."
2,Out-of-date and flawed analysis of the U.S.-Mexican border,"Although I used this text in my Border Issues class for one semester, several years ago, I quickly discarded it. Stripped to its base, Martinez's topology of border society rests on an unreconstructed version of Wallerstein's core/periphery theory of development, with societies of the advanced industrial nations at the core and those of the Third World at the periphery. Global flows of Third World economic migrants have made sections of the ""core,"" such as Los Angeles, almost indistinguish- able from Guadlajara or Mexico City, while massive programs of technology transfer to hi-tech, low-wage maquiladoras have rendered dichtomies of early World Systems categories moot. So, to build a conceptualization of a rapidly changing and expanding border area (bodies, telecommunications and infrastructure) around obsolete theoretical assumptions invites problems. And the limits of the book are shaped by such problems."
1,nautica men's sleepwear checked?,The photo on your site did not resemble the actual product. The product looked like some old man's boxer shorts sticking out the back of his pants. Plus I ordered it almost one month ahead and still did not receive it in time for Christmas.
2,Not Complete Movies,"If you are buying this collection for It Happened At Nightmare Inn, The Movie lists a 120 minute runtime but when you play it, it runs 68 minutes and the cuts are obvious. So I do not recomend you buying it for that movie alone."
2,ouch!,"Disappointingly, this tape did not perform as well as hoped. It was unable to hold medium or heavier weight fabrics in place. Using a one-inch piece under bra straps did not keep them from slipping, the tape and straps eventually started rolling. And it definitely was unable to help prevent a strapless bra from succumbing to Newton's law of gravity! So not only did fashion faux-pas continue to occur, the tape caused a rash/skin irritation with each use."
5,I was forced to read this....................... Thank God!,"It has been four years since I was obligated to read this novel in my college literature class. I am so pleased that my professor assigned this book. It still holds up today as one of the best I have ever read. Although I come from a white middle-class family in a small white-bread community, I was able to relate to these characters as sisters, as family. I have read this story several times. Even though the pages are tattered and the cover has been ripped off, I will never give this book up to any recycle bin. From page one you will be so engrossed that you will not be able to put it down. You may finish it in one sitting or fall down trying."
2,"Couldn't Get Into Supernatural, ghosts, curanderos, etc.","I tried reading this book, got just past 75 pages, and couldn't quite attach to a storyline and plot. The story kept drifting off with too many other characters, and I soon lost interest. I guess I can't get into these types of books."
1,So far from a good novel,"I read this book for my comparative literature class, and I believe that the book is terrible. Putting many foreign words, especially Spanish, made the work vague. Although she explains them in the book, I conclude her efforts to make me believe that the setting of the book might be in NM are futile. And I thought that the author was not a writer like Mark Twain. I do not think this book is a professional piece of literature."
2,Southwest Trash,"Although a technical masterpiece, ""So Far From God"" lacks any sort of intriguing plot and any real dillema altogether. This novel is a typical Southwest artwork, written in Spanglish and incredibly far fetched. No matter what genre this book is classified under, it seems to be in a league of its own, which, in this case, makes it a horrible novel. To be blunt, this novel is Southwest trash, and should be removed from the shelves immediately to make room for decent novels."
1,So Far From GOOD!,"This novel was required for an English Writing class, and I must say that the novel serves no practical purpose what-so-ever.By the novels end I was left wondering to what intention the author had in mind, but more-so to what reason did readers have to keep reading? Life is short and time is valuable, and so I only choose to read novels in which something can be gained. Okay, life is not always fair, yet the show must go on...got it. But this novel's all-too-obvious moral comes at a painfully high price; one must leave their common sense on page nineteen, only to find the storyline to be too dark, too dramatic, and a tad too driven by blind faith.The absurd storyline is only surpassed by the countless missed opportunities to offer readers something real, something tangible, something useful. Basically anybody can write a piece of nonsensical overkill, but who has the want or the time to read it?So Far From God, more like So Far From Good!"
3,This is a good book for young readers,"This is a good book for beginning readers. It links the letters of the alphabet with colorful and engaging photographs. It also shows the connection between counting and the way that our coin system works (nickels, dimes etc.) The only difficulty for young readers would be when they get half way through the book and find that the rest of the book is upside down. This might be confusing for a young reader trying to read the book by themselves. This is a book that is best shared by a young reader and a more experienced reader."
4,I owned this book as a child,"I have three sons, thier ages range from 3 to 6. My mother dropped off a bunch of books for them and in the stack was this book. I recognised it from my childhood and kept a good eye on it to be sure my children didn't destroy it. They loved it. They really enjoyed putting real coins over the pictures of coins. They learned a lot and from a book I used as a child. I love this book. It's clearly a blast from the past, the 70s I'd say. To me that adds nostalgia but I'm sure most parents would be disapointed by the dated style so I took off a star for that reason."
4,Daughter loves this book,"I purchased this book for my 15 month old as a 'down the road' book because it was recommended in the book 'Toddler 411'. Surprisingly, this book is a current favorite and she is actually saying 'a', 'b', '2' etc. Does she get the concept? I don't think so, but she's connecting the way a letter or number looks to its name (much like she does with other objects). The graphics are clear. My only small criticism is that the representation of 'v' is a heart with the word 'valentine' written on it. She is getting to know the shape off a heart so I think that might be confusing. Otherwise, I highly recommend this one!"
2,Don't bother with this Pamphlet-length Bio,"What a disapointment! I longed to get a good bio on good ole' ""splinter in the eye"" Fulci and got a hurriedly assembled, fan-boy pamphlet. Not only was the slender size a downer, so was the text. No insight or even critical assessment of Fulci the artist and his impact on European Horror films. Pass this one up folks! Read Spagetthi Nightmares instead, which profiles many Italian horror actors, writers and stars--and has real meat to it!"
4,Better than bug spray,"It's nice to have something on that the air can get through but not the bugs. If it's touching your skin, they can bite through but they fit pretty loose. Actually, the sizes are really big. My husband is 6' 225lb and the large is plenty big."
3,"seem very good, but hard to use","well, i love knives.they are a very important tool no matter what you do with them.(as long as it's legal)while on a trip with your pocket knife, preparing food with your chef's knife or anything else requires a well maintained knife.even though i didnt think this tool would replace a professional sharpening every once in a while its a good way to keep things in good shape.so in general - the 3 level system is very good!though if you take care of your knives there is no reason to use the coarse one.they do the job very well!however, they are very, very small...a little over the length of a AA battery and double the width.which makes it hard to hold or use with bigger knives.so, if you need something portable for small knives - this is a winner.so its not"
3,Kind small,"I should have purchase larger size. They work great, but just a little are to hold while using them...Actually I was looking for something to sharpen my ceramic knives. I kinda figured Diamond was harder then Ceramic...but so far I'm still looking for something to sharpen my ceramic other then shipping them back to the manufacture."
2,missleading,well i just got it today the product displays 3 sharpening diamond stones but the package only comes with 2 (red and blue)i paid for three anyway i found that these are not worth the money and time so i give it 2 stars for 2 diamond sharpening stones i would have given 4 stars but amazon lied to me
1,Do not order,Beware of this seller! Their product descriptions do not match what you get. Then when you try to get what you actually ordered they drag their feet until you give up. They still haven't fixed the description on this item like they said they would. You only get one hinge not two like in the description. Its rediculous amazon lets so called businesses such as this on their site. I'm a long time amazon User but I'm disappointed in them for not stepping in and letting these sellers put inaccurate descriptions on their product to trap customers. Very unhappy customer.
2,Not as good as the older version,"I used to own the Aqua Snappy - it was a fantastic camera! The pictures were so good, I started using it as my primary camera. But after 10 years of use, it needed repairs - but Canon refused to repair it because they said it was too old and they discontinued that model. So I purchased this as a replacement five years ago. The second time I used it the seals leaked and destroyed the film. I did check the seals for dirt first, so that wasn't the problem. It eats batteries like mad. The pictures aren't nearly as crisp as the old Snappy. I still take it to the beach sometimes, but mostly, it just sits on the shelf collecting dust. I am very disappointed. I always thought companies make improvements when they issue new products. This one is a giant step backwards."
2,Blue Fescue is not for the NC area.,"These plants did not last even one month. Sad, but a learning experience. Please advise others that the Raleigh area is not for this type of plant. We are starting over."
5,A Sensational Journey into Gang Life,"A violent but inspiring journey into what seems like Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness."" Much has changed since the Sixties, but A NATION OF LORDS remains instrutive as Dawley's success in moving an outlaw street gang into constructive community action offers lessons and encouragement for taking on the toughest challenges in urban development. A great read for anyone."
2,Another Uncle Tom's cabin point of view,"This book I thought would be entertaining to me. I found out it was written by a white man from New England who grew up in an upper class family and went to a fine university. He moved to the ghetto for 2 years to ""hang"" with the Black people and ""try to get things done"" as he says. I found it to be a book of propaganda sending messages to people about how blacks are mistreated. I am black myself and thought the book had some ok stories from news clippings but overall the book was junk. I wouldn't get this one. Try Uncle Tom's Cabin."
3,"Pretty, But You Could Do Better.","I got this for my birthday two weeks ago and I must say I am not the happiest I could be with this product.I am not sure about others, but when you turn the volume to even about halfway the sound starts to fuzz. The clarity of the music is fine if you play it very softly, or even of a low/medium level.Another bothersome thing is that every time you put your ipod into the slot, it has to 'connect' and takes a couple minutes to start playing. But that's only because of the song title feature. The fact that the top of the player scrolls across the song title is nice, but the colors of black script on blue is hard to see unless one is close to it.I wouldn't expressly reccomend it, I definitely think that you could buy something better for the amount, as the iStation is pretty pricey. I think so far, BOSE overall makes the best players, maybe not the mot attractive, but the sound is best.I hope that helps!"
4,Hot little big sound,"This little unit is big in sound and features. I love the remote and the digital readout. I have heard better small speakers, but for the features this unit has a lot. Not quite the bass I expected but acceptable. A querky interface is about the only complaint I have. For the price this unit has the features and the volume to keep things thumping."
5,Easy to Use Fax Machine,"I purchased this as a gift for my parents who did not want a fax associated with a computer printer. They absolutely love it. It was easy to set up, and the quality of both copies and faxes received is excellent.I have other Canon products, and Canon customer service is one of the best in the industry. Although, my parents have not yet had any questions about this item, I have on other Canon products I own. Canon is always very helpful and willing to answer any question, plus they totally stand behind their products.I would highly recommend this product if you are looking for a basic fax machine with excellent print quality and a low price."
1,A nightmare machine,"I bought this machine as a canon loyalist, and because its pretty. Well it pretty much is a nightmare, as another reviewer said, I have spent hours and hours trying to figure out how to get it to switch from fax to phone, it always answers fax. The ring is ungodly loud and I can't figure out how to reduce it. I tried three different answering machines with it and returned them to best buy, staples and radio shack as none of them worked with this machine. If i could get my money back I would. It is a waste of money if you want a fax phone. Copies are nice and if all you want is fax, its ok. Instructions are confusion personified and I too am a tech person who sets all things up herself."
3,OK Product/Poor Instructions,"I've owned this machine for about a year. The first one had problems and had to be returned; immediately. The replacement has worked adequately; I can send and receive faxes. However, it is not a very intuitive machine and the instruction manual is poorly written. I have placed an answering machine on the same telephone line; and setting that up was difficult because the instructions were poor; I had to call customer service several times to reset it up after power failures at my house. Also, the paper just shoots out of the machine; there's nothing to catch it; so the machine has to have at least 12"" between it and the edge of the desk or the faxes fall on the floor. I have had a refurbished canon injet printer which worked well and that was part of why I bought this fax; not as well designed."
2,Fax isn't fast or easy,"I have many electonic 'gadgets'. I am the one who sets them up and maintains them, from our TV, audio system, computer, etc. This is not my first fax machine, but may be my last. I wanted it as a fax and also as a faster way of making black and white copies. Scanning can be a pain when you are in a hurry. Well, scanning is faster and easier than this thing."
3,things that go hmmmmm....,"www.Basenotes.com says...A leathery musky scent, with leather running through top, middle and base notes. The amber glass bottle is replica of an antique Viennese apothecary bottle.* Top Notes* Plum, 'Fluid' Leather, Fresh notes .*Middle Notes* 'Sensual' Leather, Suede notes.*Base Notes* 'Noble' Leather."
3,Average.,"Uneven little collection of songs mostly recorded during the 1980's. Includes songs by Abba chicks Frida & Agnetha Faltskog, 10 CC, the Everly Brothers etc. The only highlight is the closing track 'Lilac Wie' by Elkie Brooks.Track Listing:1. Comment Te Dire Adieu.

1,Elementary at best,"I currently live in Asia. I purchases my Magellan on a trip home to Chicago. Back home, the default map displays almost all mapped roads and landmarks, and even some I didn't know existed.I purchased MapSend so I could have decent maps of the area I live and travel in.Silly me to think that it would perform with accuracy as it did back home...The mapsend features in Asia where I've used it (Japan, Korea, Thailand, Philippines, Bangladesh) show at most 10 percent of the roads and landmarks, and all of those are displayed in horribly inaccurate positions (as much as 3 KM in some cases).Were talking big landmarks including things like International Airports here.A very poor product but one star given because it's better than nothing."
1,PRODUCT KNOWN BAD BY MANUFACTURER!!!,"I purchased a copy of Magellan Worldwide Basemap. I installed it in my computer but it would not run. When this also happened to a second computer I installed it on I contacted Magellan Technical Support. After asking me about the relative positions of stickers on the back of the CD jewel case I was told I had a defective disk and was offered a replacement in 4 to 6 weeks! Since I will have returned from my trip to Europe before the replacement arrives the product is totally useless to me. Don't buy this product until they have ""good"" disks available. The good ones have the stickers on the back of the jewel case in an ""L"" configuration, on the bad disks the stickers are parallel."
1,MY GOD WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY,"i ordered cause i want to make a trip to south america, so i waited for the cd (with the maps) and what i received was a useless cd, i installed in my pc, and after says that will no work, i installed the patch, and guess?? it didn`t work, so i emailed the tech support, and they said ""we have a problem with the security stuff in the cd, we are working on it, when we have fix it, we will send a new cd for you"" and guess..... (yes you are right) 1 year and a half passed, and i don`t have the cd..., what a bad tech support.., then pleople say, don`t go to piracy..... don`t waste your money..,"
4,Behold by Vocolot,A variety of styles on this mostly acapella CD of women's voices. Lovely to listen to.
2,Difficult and Disorienting,"The President is a series of stories connected with the mystery of the murder of a government official, ""the man with the little mule,"" on the steps of a Cathedral. The narrative is interspersed with poem-like and song-like passages in which the same or similar motifs -- songbirds and certain noises -- are oft repeated. As the murder is ""solved,"" characters have weird adventures which are sometimes narrated in the style of fairy tales.That the mostly dissociative and nauseating narrative style (it involves much confusion, random interludes of obsessive, repetitive onomatopoeia and verse, and deeply affective scenes of brutality and torture) accurately reflects the lived reality under certain Latin American regimes is not questioned here. Yet, I fear that the thoroughly disorienting experience of reading The President will alienate all but the most interested and motivated readers."
2,School text was difficult and not enjoyable,"Giving it 2 stars because it's quite long when considering how much is happening. I confused characters and found it difficult to understand what was going on and why -- I had to read the Wikipedia article describing the plot to understand what was happening. This book contains a lot of surrealism; I often found myself feeling for the characters ""this can't be happening..."" Considering that the book was based off of an actual dictator, it makes it a compelling and frightening read... Again, something I dislike.Recommended for: people interested in learning about dictatorships, history, surrealism, or Latin America. Good for foreigners, 20something white males.Not recommended for: kids, narrow minded adults, university students."
2,Not what I expected,"I purchased this phone for my father since he needs the boost in volume and clarity during phone conversations, however, I would not buy it again. I didn't get to try it out since I sent it directly to him (big mistake) so I didn't realize that it is too complicated for an older person, the voice clarity is not good, and the caller ID function does not work in the same way that a regular phone does. The boost in volume is way too loud and muffled. Not a good purchase, and I wish we had sent it back now."
2,Tolkien and the Silmarils,"I'm afraid I found this literary study of the Silmarillion rather slight. It seemed focused on shoehorning the Bible into every aspect of the work, while mentioning only in passing or not at all influences such as Volsungssaga/Nibelungenlied, Voluspa, and classical myth.The most interesting aspect of the story for me, the tragedy of Feanor and his sons, is not the aspect which most interests Helms--very well. But an exegesis that offers no analysis of the Quenta's conclusion, the fates of Maedhros and Maglor, seems strange.Suffice to say I didn't get much out of this."
1,over-simplified gruel,"as a humongous fan of RA Wilson, felt sure that the book would be great. it was harder to get through than the celestine prophecy, and about as poorly written. if the celestine prophecy and dan brown books are your idea of fun/interesting/challenging reading, then this is for you. i however, couldn't take it seriously and decided to sell it by the time i got to page 113. can't say i didn't try.i found the storyline unsophisticated, the characters uni-dimensional and/or obviously representative, and sometimes even downright offensive or unbelievable, especially when they had a non-american culture attached to them. i feel as though this writer should take a few more novel writing classes, learn how to make a book that doesn't feel like a home movie being passed off as a blockbuster."
5,Bile is back!,"This is an AWESOME CD, I ordered mine from their official site and this is just amazing. It blasts out heavy-as-hell guitars and drum, and the vocals are just great. Get your money's worth here! This and Teknowhore are maybe the best Bile albums ever. The version of ""In League"" on Sex Reflex in my opinion is better than on Strangeland. Don't waste your money- put it towards something useful! Buy this!"
3,needed more songs,"On this album Bile's sound isn't as distorted as their earlier albums and you can understand more of the vocals. My favorite song would have to be Betty Page, other good songs would be sex reflex, rock is dead in bed, in league, double fang and when the dead come home. The only problem with this cd is that there are too many tracks that aren't songs but just noise. If it had a few more songs like the ones that I mentioned then I would have given this cd 5 stars."
4,Bile is awesome...,"I think that Bile is one of the coolest techno/metal out there. My favorite song is In League, which is also featured on the movie StrangeLand as they perform. Bile has a great stage show, and this is even better than Suckpump, which used to be my favorite Bile CD. I highly recommend this album."
5,Go-Go Nelson,There are many adventures to the Nelson family and I have viewed them all. It is a great way to get back to tradition and the need to have some good role models. I heard that one of the grandchildren will be planning to put together the entire 144 shows on one DVD. I am waiting...
3,"Works great, but wears out fast.","This is my second dmt sharpener; and it's coated on one side only. Of course that's in the product description and it does cut fast. Don't think I'll be buying another, the combo medium and fine folder is a much better product. Live and learn....."
4,My Daughter Loves These Gals,"I had never heard of these dolls until my daughter and I were in ToysRus and she spotted them. I let her pick one set out and she has loved playing with it. She's 8 and I thought they wouldn't keep her interest, but she seems to have fun with her imagination while playing. She is also a Polly Pocket fan, but these are at the top of her list today!"
4,great effect but a little delicate,This product looks great especially when combined with a whisper fan and other lighted products. The only bad thing about these is the wiring is a bit delicate. I was hooking mine up and putting it in place and the connector got caught on something and ripped out. I was able to MacGuyver a new connection with some of the computer parts I have kept over the years. I would just warn that you are very careful with the installation.
3,...wait. what.,I recieved my item on 4/18/11. two days faster than i expected. but that is no problem. the duct was a little tricky to install because there were no instructions on the box. other than that it wasn't two difficult to figure out. the LED's were in the way of installation and the wire was a little to short.On top of that only one of the LED's was bright enough to see without a little effort. Since i have the Green whisper legacy(Which i had no problems with and absolutely love)i dont mind the dimness of the lights. all in all you would probably be better off just getting an unlit clear duct.Black Cat 667
2,wtf,i hooked this up and as soon as i turned on the power it shorted out the chip that controls my fan i don't know what caused it there wasn't any crossed wires or bare wire maybe just an overload so id say be careful
1,no need anymore after we bought a fastreader from wisdomforce,"FastReader from http://www.wisdomforce.com allow very quickly and efficiently extract, export, import, load, massage large volumes of data from Oracle tables to Oracle or others like DB2 or MySQL or SQL Server. So I only need now is FastReader User Guide. No need for ""hidden"" Oracle utils"
4,directed to new land,"Content directed to new land and showed how to find such info in future releases.. Introduction to OraStack, OraDim, MaxMem.. and Java within Oracle is excellent. Well balanced content.."
2,Limited value to a DBA,"Hopefully pl/sql or Java developers could find something in this book, but as an Oracle DBA I am very disappointed.This book has a misleading title and does not tell much about the real database utilities.""Includes Oracle 9i"" says the book cover. Well, it is true only if one believes that nine lines of an elementary description are sufficient for learning new 9i feature like External Table. At the same time, an old ""utility"" - ""oerr"" - deserved almost seven pages. For the Utilities such as Export, Import, SQ*Loader, and DBV this book simply lists the available parameters (options)... The book cover did not tell us how basic all this was going to be!To summarize, Oracle ""seasoned professionals"" who read documentation will hardly find new tricks in this book.Title and cover pages of professional publications should better reflect the contents and depth of the material, and correctly describe the target audience."
2,Where are the details?,"The utilities explained in this book lack details. Which is a critical flaw for a book professesing to explain utilities. Virtually every utility explained in this book had to be researched further by me in the internet to gain a better understanding of when and how to use it, which, of course, defeated the purpose of me paying good money for this book.One exception, TKPROF is explained beautifully and in detail. Otherwise, the real value of this book is the author's list of Oracle's most useful utilities."
3,WARNING - not a 20/24 pin power connector.,"Be warned, the specification says 20/24 but its not. Its a straight 20 pin. I have no other feedback, havent hooked it up. But I think this is probably important to many!"
2,Way too noisy,"This is a replacement power supply for a compaq/HP computer that is about 3 1/2 years old. It replaces a bestec 250-12z which was fairly quiet. The Echostar is LOUD. It works fine, so far, but if you have to be in close proximity to the computer dont buy this unit."
4,Great music!,If you're into flamenco music then you must get this. If you're into gypsy flamenco then you DEFINITELY have to get this!Chico is a great cantautor of the gypsy flamenco genre. The music is heartfelt and honestly isn't that what it's all about?!
1,Broke after one year,"I bought my heater a year ago, and it works well, when it turns on. The digital settings are extremely fussy. It turns off repeatedly regardless of the timer or thermostat. Now the fan turns on and off repeatedly, and the heater will only stay on for 5 minutes. I think it's finally broken.If you do buy this (which you shouldn't), keep your receipts and proof of purchase for the warranty."
1,Stay away!,I've been through two of these heaters. Both failed within about 30 days. Choose another product! I am going to.
1,Problems -,"Two weeks after this HDTV was purchased the color matrix setting locked into the HD mode and cannot be reset eventhough the broadcasts are standard definition.The 3D Y/C filter has locked in the OFF adversely affecting the picture.Aspect ratio locked into the Full mode and about a week later on its own, locked into the 4:3 aspect for all broadcasts.I cannot use the TV for fear of burn in. Attempts to telephone consumer support have been unsuccessfull as their line is continually busy.Instead,a letter was written to Panasonic and I'm awaiting a reply. If I could,true rating would be ZERO stars but you can't rate this low."
4,Fun and Edecational all in one!: or : Where's my crayons?,"I picked this one up at a local store (sorry amazon) as a gift to a little girl in the medieval group I belong to, and while flippig through at the checkout line, I relized I needed a copy for myself. I only wish that the documentation refrenced some sorses. Paintings or brass rubbings would be cool.But still a really neat book."
1,Disappointed,"Apparently I didn't do my homework. With a name like ""Archer's Bible"", I was expecting information on nearly all topics of archery. All this book is is a catalogue of archery items, like a Sears or Penny's book. Might as well have thrown my money in the trash."
1,No images,"Perfect written book but I tought it was full of images about insects, but nothing just text!"
4,"Solid, early NR","I was hesitant to buy this b/c it was early NR & could be too Harlequin formulaic. I should have just trusted Nora; it'd early, but solid , engaging story. Yes, there are a couple ""oh, come on"" moments, but I enjoyed both characters & the story. Well worth the read."
4,Wonderful!,"As other reviewers have said the cover is misleading because the story is not set around christmas. This is my first Nora Roberts book. I did not realize until later that it was a reprint of one of her older novels. Gabe is a painter who is in a cabin locked away in the woods for many months. Since losing his brother Micheal he has not been able to paint. Along comes Laura, pregnant and stranded in the blizzard and needing protection. So starts this novel about finding love a second time around, learning to heal and putting old demons behind. I think the author could have wrapped the story up in lesser pages. I also felt she allowed the main characters to be in too much torture that dragged on for too long. Overall I did enjoyed it looking forward to reading another Nora Roberts novel."
2,NOT J.D. ROBB,"As a big J.D. Robb fan I was sorely disappointed at this Nora Roberts effort. Very contrived plot, not enough character development to make you really hate the bad guys, or love the good guys. Even with the “happy ending” the reader is left with serious doubts about these characters ability to ever be really happy."
4,Complicated but satisfying,Uphill climb of two people who are drawn to each other but have to cut through so much baggage to understand the simplicity of their love for each other.
3,Gabriel's Angel,The book was okay. It was hard the keep my attention. The characters were too silly and weren't sincere enough.
3,A Nora Roberts Short,"Three stars for a fair story. Predictable but wholly believable and in the best of story telling. Excellent characters, story line is well planned, as usual. It is a short story, fast to read but very predictable.A great book to read between heavier reads."
3,Not her best work...,It's not terrible but it's short so everything happens too fast. The thing I hate about that is that the character development is lacking and there seems to be a lot of repetition of thoughts to try and make up for it. This just gets annoying. I love Nora Roberts but haven't read any of her short stories that I liked as of yet. She is capable of so much better.
4,Review of Gabriel's Angel,"'This is the story of a young, pregnant, sexually, mentally abused widow running away from her deceased husbands wealthy family who only want to steal her baby. She literally runs into a successful artist in a snow storm in the Colorado mountains totally destroying her car. He gives her a place to hide, delivers her son, falls in love, they marry, conquer many obstacles and ""live happily ever after"""
5,Gabriele's angel,II thoroughly enjoyed it and it put me in the Christmas mood since we had not had snow here yet
4,Really enjoyed this one!,"This is a great love story with some unusual twists.... great, entertaining read. Typical Nora Roberts style, which I love."
4,nora roberts,Was a good read fast and interesting but predictable. I like to read them but do prefer a little more depth.
4,Gabriel s angel,I loved this book. It had great detail ! It had a a lot of parts that couldn't out the book down !
3,Not one of her best,Nora Roberts has many excellent books and some that are just okay and almost what I would consider fillers in between the really good ones. I've never read one yet that was bad.
5,Another great Nora Roberts book,Nora Roberts has done it again. Loved the book and all the characters. She just pulls you in to her story.
3,"Nice, but predictable","A good read, but predictable. At first I thought I'd already read this book. Not quite as deep as many of Robert's other books."
2,Not Her Best,Nora Roberts is falling into the trap of so many successful authors - not hungry anymore and too formulaic. I thought she was better than this.
4,Love Story,"This was a nice read. Sort of a different Christmas story line. I think most will enjoy it, especially if you like Nora Roberts."
2,Gabriel's Angel,"Definitely kept me turning the pages. I liked how Nora Roberts brought to light how confusing it is when partners do not communicate openly. I felt the portrayal of how people with money can be narcissistic was viable, in fact the book covered a wide range of emotions and challenges in relationships. Yet, something was missing for me. I may have been looking for even more depth of the characters surrounding Gabe and Laura. Over all an enjoyable book but still 2 1/2 stars from me."
3,Classic Nora,"This is a predictable Nora Roberts story and is heartwarming, but no surprises, twists or turns. Loved the two settings; snowy isolated moutain cabin and wonderful San Francisco."
3,"OK, but not a fave","This was an OK story, but sort of the typical romance novel. I prefer the action and sass of the Eve Dallas books this author writes under another name. Not a bad read, just predictable."
3,Good Read,I didnt know really what to expect with this book.. I am so glad I picked it up. Much more adult than her other stuff and really entertaining. Buying the rest of her books!
3,Gabriel`s Angel,"Not the best book by Roberts. I have read all of her books and found this story predictable. I did not feel a connection with the characters. On another note as this is my first review, give the wild crazy lovemaking a rest already. I work in women's healthcare and can tell you real people don't have Love lives like that."
3,Gabriel's Angel,"A typical N Roberts book. The woman has a bad childhood, meets a man of wealth and proves she is worthy. This is similar to her J.D. Robb books. It is an easy read, it is romantic and as always has a happy ending."
5,Winter read,This was a good read for snowy days when you can't get out and about...It held my interest and was entertaining.
5,I loved the story!,"I will recommend this book to all that enjoy an emotional, loving,kind,sad,happily,ups n downs to this great book. The ending was like a fairytale. Definitely a book to buy. I love it."
5,Gabriel's Angel,"Very predictable, but held my interest. . .a very sweet love story! Where are there men like Gabe? He's almost too good to be true. . .but, admirable at the same time!"
5,Gabriel's Angel,Excellent as always by Nora Roberts! Roberts has the gift so that you fully see and feel each character! You become immersed in the story and can't put it down!
3,Liked it but it was not my favorite Nora Roberts book,I found the book entertaining but somewhat predictable. The characters were likable but not quite as developed as most Nora Roberts books.
5,Gabriel's Angel,"Another top notch book by Nora Roberts. I not only recommend this book to others, I will read it again myself."
5,Gabriel's Angel,"just like the rest of her books, a great romantic book for a rainy day. interesting, entertaining and keeps you reading until done"
5,Great Read,I love all her books but there is something special about this one. This is a great read for any who loves a good love story.
5,Typical Nora Roberts....Thank Heaven!,"Another well written novel by Nora Roberts with characters that you would like to meet. The story flows, the characters meld, the setting descriptions are vivid. Enjoy a little escape and read Gabriel's Angel."
4,Unexpected,"I was expecting something a little different for a Nora Roberts book, however it was deffiinitely a great book!!! I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good book by Nora Roberts,"
2,Hmmmm...sounds familiar,This book has little original and imaginative plot content. A beautiful pregnant woman gets married to a man for the sake of her baby. They fall in love. Awwww. Romantic fluff.
2,Gabriel's Angel,"How misleading! I thought I was buying a Christmas book; afterall, it was advertised as this year's Christmas tale. There is no reference to Christmas whatsoever in the book; in fact, it takes place in April. Don't buy it if you want to read a Christmas story."
3,Typical Romance NOT!,"Gabe's brother had died a few months before and he felt that he needed time alone to sort out his emotions. The perfect place for him to be secluded and enable him to try and paint once again was at his cabin. The solitude was disrupted when a pregnant Laura wrecks her car and Gabe rescues her.Nora Roberts then throws in the typical story line of them falling in love, marrying moments (and I do mean moments) before the baby is born, etc. As typical Nora Roberts' style, GABRIEL'S ANGEL doesn't flow along the lines followed by every other romance writer. She always includes interesting detours that sets her apart from the rest. In GABRIEL'S ANGEL, she tosses in a wealthy ex-mother-in-law who is determined to take the baby out of Laura's care. Then the battle of the wealthy matriarchs ensues.Don't let the synopsis of this book trick you into believing that GABRIEL'S ANGEL will be a typical romance. It's nothing but atypical when written by Nora Roberts."
3,"Good story, not worth the $$ they want for reprint",I was dissapointed to bring this book home only to discover that it wasn't a Christmas book as it had been marketed... Also that I had read this in paperback years ago (and for much cheaper than the $17 I paid!)I am a die hard Nora Roberts fan. I enjoyed it although it was not her best work. I'll always look for the NR symbol on her books so that I know it's a new story /vs/ old reprinted.
3,Old stuff rehashed,"I was somewhat surprised to see this offered. I read it quite a few years ago when it was orginally offered as a Harlequin Intimate Moments. It was ok for a few bucks then, but not worth the $17 they want for it now."
2,Not my favorite,"I've read numerous Nora Roberts books and usually enjoy them for the characters and how she develops them. This book lacked that. As another reviewer mentioned, I also found that I couldn't connect to the characters and found them unlikeable and a bit flat. I finished the book because I felt I should, but I didn't like it. I did like Roberts' Blue Smoke and Blue Dahlia, both of which take more time with the story. I'd recommend spending the money on them over this."
4,A feel-good romance to spark the holiday spirit,"Odd that this book is being marketed as a Christmas book when it is set in April! I suppose falling in love while stranded together during a late winter blizzard, complete with a natural setting and cozy fireplace, might evoke feelings of the holiday. As well, a troubled pregnant traveler given shelter and care by the kindness of a stranger loosely parallels the theme of the Christmas story.Laura and Gabe are both wounded souls thrown together by unexpected circumstances. Falling in love helps each other to heal: Gabe overcomes his grief and finds new inspiration for his art, and Laura learns to trust again and developes the strength to stand up to her powerful former in-laws. In the process, they form a loving family. This story is easily read in one or two sittings and is sure to warm the heart!"
1,Gabriel's Angel,"I love Nora Roberts, but $6.99 is too much $ for only 288 pages, if I'm going to spend that much I want to read for more than 2 days, sorry!"
4,Review of Gabriels Angel,"Really enjoyed reading this story. Although one could figure out what would happen, it was entertaining and alsokept me wanting to read more."
1,Didn't like,I did not like this book. First book I have ready by Nora Roberts but I won't buy any more. There are better authors out there.
2,Straightforward,"There is nothing new or exciting about this book. This is a typical romance with no surprises, twists or turns..."
3,Gabriel's Angel,Romantic novels are not my 'cup of tea'. I have read and enjoyed some of Roberts's work but I had forgotten she wrote in this genre. It was a pleasant read and did not take long.
4,Gabriel's Angel,This is another good book by a favorite author. I liked the plot and the way each character was described.
5,Loved it,"It was wonderful, only read it too fast and wished I could keep readiing! Very enjoyable and easy to read!!"
3,Beach or Summer Read,The book is enjoyable but very predictable as many of her books are and a light read. Typical book for the beach or summer read where do want to think a whole lot.
4,Review for Gabrilel's Angel,I enjoyed the book and I am glad that I read this sweet story.However;it is not a book that would read over and over again.
5,Enjoyed this book. Read it while on vacation,A perfect book to relax and cuddle up with. Once I picked it up I didn't want to put it down.
3,Gabriel'Ángel,It is a classic romantic book.It does not confront you with surprises.It is well written although in some way foreseeable.Characters are describe on a very precise and thorough style.
5,Endearing,What an awesome book. Nora Roberts as always writes a book you don't want to put down. From beginning to end a lovely story with romance tastefully written suitable for anyone to read.
3,Old but Ok,"/this is a reissue and I wish they would say that upfront. She's gotten better over the years and it shows in this. He smokes , there's no ""safe sex"" and she's too sweet and wimpy. Admittedly she grows up but the more modern heroines by Roberts start out with some strength. You can see what kind of stuff Roberts will write...the bones are there...but not as good as the more recent work."
1,The worst!,"I downloaded this book as an escape novel for a snowy day. It was seriously one of the worst books I have read in a long time. Terribly written and more like a harlequin romance than anything else. Contrived, formulaic, and boring. I could have given you the whole plot after the first chapter. Seriously, it will be a long time before I give Nora Roberts another look. As an avid reader, I expect more from these authors.Terrible... save your money!!"
2,Gabriel's Boring Angel,I found the book predictable and somewhat boring. The only reason I continued to read it was that I hoped something would happen and add a twist. It never happened.
1,Gabriel's Angel,"First of all, it has been reprinted to look like a Christmas book but it has nothing to do with Christmas. Second, there was no storyline that I felt was anything close to being believable. Third, nothing happened to keep my interest. I couldn't like any of the characters or believe any of them could actually think that way."
4,Nice collection of pictures of Himalayas,This book contains the collection of best photographs taken by the author. The photos are without doubt scintillating. Author has attempted to describe how to do photography describing his own experiences. Mostly you end up looking photographs and insight into photography seems missing. Nevertheless an extremely nice book for all Himalaya and Nature lovers
5,"Good looking, comfortable shoes","I found these shoes more than $45 cheaper than the original advertised price of $89.00. I was thrilled but could not get the wide width in my size so I settled for the B width. Upon trying them on, I knew I would have to do something to make them wider so I put shoe trees in and it worked pretty good. These shoes are well built and look quite sleek. I think they are true to size and width because they were too tight in the normal B width but bearable when stretched, which means the wide width would have been perfect."
3,This shoe should be labeled NARROW only.,Great shoe if it was not a AAA. Order the Wide for a regular medium fit. Gave mine to my daughter for school shoes and went to Rockport store and got a wide.
5,70's Gold,This is a great CD! I love it and the choid=ce of music the is on it! It arrived on time and in good condition.
5,Great Oldies,"I was extremely pleased with my 70's Gold purchase. The price was great. I got 40 hits that brought back some GREAT memories. It was delivered quickly, and there were no hassles from start to finish.Lou Del"
3,Just a few comments,"My experience in the past with the various Universal ""Gold"" collections has been very good. The titles are good representations of the era, the analog to digital transference is good and it is all original music- no cover bands. But I have to say there is nothing very special here. As another reviewer put it- Nothing here that you couldn't get anywhere else. Anyone who had an even half-way comprensive 70's Rock collection would pass on this CD. Even though I love the ""Universal Gold"" guys to death I have to give this CD set three stars. (Maybe it's just a case of ""You can't please all the people all the time"")"
3,"Decent quality, but slow","This mill is of good quality. It has an adjustable screw under the housing which allows you to determine the size of the grind you prefer. It's extremely convenient when seasoning a bird and you've got one hand soaked in chicken juices.My main complaint with the item is that it's extremely slow in grinding. Other minor complaints include the noise and the fact that pepper lands on ledges underneath of the grinder, so you have to sort of shake it while grinding to make sure you keep your application well distributed.I don't regret the purchase, but do imagine there are better products available."
5,A Great Improvement,"This is a great improvement from the original, with nearly all the wrong info fixed, I have the CBT version, excellent study material."
1,not useful for MCSE test~,"Well, I bought and find out that at least in Network Essential and NT Server 4.0!! I suggest those who just want to pass the MCSE test not buying this book since most of the problems are not the MCSE test style~ But for those who just what to enhance the ability, this one may be consider since it took a lot of time examing your skill about Registry in NT Server test!"
5,"Good Content, So So Testing Software...","The format is a little dated, still good content for the money. It is good value. Don't expect everything to be perfect. But good place to start. I used trancenders as my practice test solution. Buy it as a starting point."
2,"Sadly, not up to scratch anymore.","I thought this would be good value - earlier reviewers seemed to think so.Unfortunately, the implementation of this is really not that great. Essentially, you're just presented with huge amounts of information, exam by exam, with little realisation that there's a large amount of crossover for each of the exams. As such, it's a long and laborious read.This is not a cheap way around paying for good books on the MCSE exams - unfortunately, your money is better spent on Alan Carter's Windows NT 4.0 MCSE Study Guide, and then other books for the electives"
1,Good for high school,"I just got back from the testing center with a ""FAIL"" 53%! The software test is NO where near the exam! I was scoring 90%+ on the software testing. The book that is in the box by Matthew Shepker (MSCE Core NT Exams)is very informative and the best part of the deal!"
1,Flakey Battery,"This battery has been on and off flakey. It would simply jump to low power reporting, leaving my laptop to power off without hibernation. It's inital battery life was OK, but less than a year later with daily use it is very noticably degraded.I contacted customer support, but they were not very helpfull. They offered to send a RMA, but never did and I just haven't felt like pursuing it."
1,Don't waste your money or time.,This book has all of the usual defects of books from Kluwer Academic Publishers. Acronyms in the text and terms in equations are not defined. Diagrams have errors. It seems to be a cut and paste job with very little systematic development of the subject. Graphs of CAD program outputs are presented with no or very little comment or discussion. There is one case of a technical error. A mathematical program output which claims to show the effects of amplifier noise figure really illustrates the beneficial effects of dithering data to overcome the effects of finite word length in FFT calculations.
4,Red Wings Watch,Watch was a described. Delivery was very quick. Size adjustment of band was simple. My husband is a big Wings fan and really loved this watch.
4,Suncet Court & Echoes in Crimson,"True Romance Films with happy endings. If you have a soft spot for love stories,you will enjoy these. Men would consider them ""chick flicks"". I enjoyed them."
5,Space Opera at its very best. First Rate!,"This, the second book of the Lucky 13th Spaceborne Assault Team (SAT,)pits the characters you were introduced to in the first novel (Until Releived) fighting for their lives once again out on a limb. They are to be detached from the main body and fight the enemy, outnumbered in a side show from the main battle, deceiving and drawing off the enemy to releive pressure on the other two SATs. Once again, the 13th is outnumbered, alone, and fighting to stay alive, not knowing if their mission is ultimately vital to the war effort, or a mere Side Show."
5,Cheap only in price,"I've been using these for a while now. They work well, and I've only had a few break out of the hundreds I've been through. For the price, you really can't beat it."
3,Good toothpick but the floss frays between my tight teeth!,"My wife and I have used flossers for years and we have tried about 6 or 7 brands. I like these flossers as the toothpick portion is one of the better ones out there. I like that the toothpick is curved, thin and sharp to help get something that is stuck between your teeth.If you use flossers to accomplish your daily flossing then these are not my favorites. They will get the job done but I have some really tight spaces between my teeth and I generally need two or three of these to floss my teeth as I either fray the floss or it breaks. I like the mint flavor but the floss just doesn't hold up for me.Since I buy these for flossers then the rating is a 3 star review. Not bad but there are issues when using these in my mouth. This is probably a personal issue that can vary with each user."
5,UNPUTDOWNABLE!!! VERY GOOD BOOK!!!!!,"I could not put this book down. This plot operates outside the traditional ""island adventure"" box to create a truly original drama set in an awe inspiring, exotic location. Technically very well done, it keeps you gripped, wanting to see what happens on the next page. I attribute this mainly to the story's originality. It's truly like nothing you've ever read before. The suspense builds and builds until the amazing ending concept washes over the reader. What appears simple is actually very complex and the author has pulled it off in a gracefully taut writing style. Truly amazing. Great suspense! Definitely recommend this book to everyone!"
2,Mild Island,"I'm assuming the person who asked if I'd review this book has already read a few of my other reviews and knows I am an honest person. With that out of the way, let me be brief: Datoga Island was written about as rocky and bumpy as the very race it describes. The story was okay...I had expected a little more based on the intriguing description on the book's back cover, something with bloody confrontations and characters being pushed to extremes of survival in a harsh environment while attempting to solve some ages-old mystery. Instead, the book comes across as a much more simple and cheerful tale that plods along hinting at excitement without ever really delivering a whole lot. If author Chetan Dave would slow down his writing style, find himself a good proof reader, and write stories with a bit more action per chapter, a bit more meat to them, he may come up with something special. Datoga Island is all sizzle, little steak. Not bad, but I know he could do better."
2,It is a book too feministic,"There is a film, that has been produced from the book. AnaBelén is the main character. Please, remark how beautiful she is."
5,exactly what i needed for a curved blade,sharpens my sheep foot pocket knife perfectly. very sturdy handle and well made. easy to clean just rinse with water. haven't sharpened any of my ss knives with it so cant comment on that. i think this is a good size for small knives.
4,PLAIN BROWN SWIM SUIT,"THIS SWIM SUIT IS A GOOD ONE FOR GALS WHO ARE A BIT FEARFUL OF PUTTING ONE ON. THE SIZE IS TRUE TO FIT. I GOT THE SIZE 12 BUT IT IS A BIT TOO LARGE FOR MY 147 LB. BODY. THE SIZE 10 WOULD HAVE BEEN PERFECT. IT IS MADE WITH A VERY STURDY CONSTRUCTION, NOT FLIMSY OR THIN. WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ONE & THE OTHERS SIMILAR TO IT."
1,Whirry fans beware!,"For all those who may be entranced by Shannon Whirry's on-screen presence, forget about this movie. The plot and scenery are so weak that not even the sexiest gal on the planet can save this movie from boring the viewer. There are plenty of other Shannon Whirry vehicles that provide more of what the viewer is after without completely putting him to sleep."
3,3 stars for Shannon Whirry,"As the title of my review says I give this movie 3 stars because of its star: the delicious Shannon Whirry. Ms. Whirry worked in a lot of better thrillers but this one delivers the goods by casting her as a stripper. That was a part she was born to play with that body! If you want to see Shannon Whirry bump and grind and take it off try this movie. If you want a good erotic thriller with the Goddess of the B's try Body of Influence, Mirror Images 2, Lady In Waiting or either of the Animal Instincts films."
3,Kangaroo Keeper needs work,"There are lots of pockets in the Kangaroo Keeper, unfortunately most of the pockets are too small to be of use. It would be a better product to eliminate a couple pockets and increase the size of the rest of the pockets to make them useable. There are only two pockets that appear to be big enough to hold a pair of glasses and a cell phone the rest don't seem to be of use for anything else."
5,Great reference and software,This book is perfect for students and civil engineers working in the hydraulics or hydrology field. The software included is great to have a better feel of the theory.
5,Long-lasting Quality,I have had this camera for more than 2 years now and have never been let down. This camera has documented several important events and vacations for me and always does a great job. People compliment me and ask how I learned to take such good pictures. Perfect for trips and vacations and ok for events and family photos.
3,Disappointing for a Canon camera,"After being an exceptionally satisfied owner of a semi-automatic Canon camera, I expected to find the same level of satisfaction with my purchase of a Canon Z135 zoom camera. While the camera performs adequately well in taking quality outdoor photos, it falls far behind in flash photography. While advertised as having a red-eye reduction capability, I have found red-eye to be an ongoing problem and existing in every photo where people or animals are photographed. I am extremely disappointed in the performance of this camera in the price range where it is sold. I would expect this level of quality to be acceptable only in a camera costing much less. I have owned this camera for two years and have discontinued using it because of the frustration I feel when my prints are returned and do not meet my level of expectation. I should have done more research before buying this product where most of my selection was based on the Canon name."
3,Very small viewfinder,This camera takes excellent pictures once you focus on the subject if you can find the subject through the very small viewfinder. Very disappointed in this feature.
2,disappointing...,"We purchased this camera two years ago. It initially lived up to the Canon name, taking great pictures and providing ease of use. The 135mm zoom was outstanding. Unfortunately, that was short lived. Soon after ruining several rolls of vacation film with the camera the honeymoon was over. All the pictures were blurred beyond belief. We sent it back for repair (the warranty had just ran out) and $90.00 later, we were taking pictures again. Now, 6 months later, the picture quality is, again, going to hell. Pictures are blurred. Red eye abounds.We are now looking at a new 35mm camera and we will certainly not be buying a Canon."
5,A Super Camera That Takes Wonderful Shots!,"After my first Canon Z135 was left in a taxi in Thailand, I had an excuse to research a replacement all over again. I don't tend to pick the same thing again when I can have something new and different, but there just isn't another compact zoom camera that takes pictures anywhere near the quality of those I get with my Z135 (you'll see what I mean when you buy one and compare). The portraits are particularly stunning and the camera is much faster than others (the competitors use only one battery and take too long to focus and snap). I used to lug around an SLR with various lenses, but this camera replaced all of it. As a result, I tend to have it with me when the great shots are out there. The zoom range is impressive and the handy dial on the back makes it simple to turn on and shoot with. This is a wonderful camera!"
2,Good examples but some strange best practices,"If you are looking for a quick read that gives you examples for Excel / Access projects, this is a useful book. However, many of the author's tips on software development range from curious to flawed and should be taken with a grain of salt (such as adding small numbers to denominators to avoid divide by zero errors). Some important areas such as scalability and security are also absent. For a full review, please see my post at [...]."
1,This book is useless.,"Although the sevice was pretty good, item arrived on time, etc. The book is almost useless."
4,Great for Office Automation,I code in Access VBA but need to push data to excel spreadsheets and format the results. This book has the answers.Would have gotten 5 stars but I didn't find a single reference to the Access TransferSpreadsheet function which pushes data to Excel Named ranges.
4,Excellent for Beginners and Intermediates,"I have quite a bit of experience with Excel and I am new to using Access. Right now, I am writing tools for business use and some personal use and this book has helped me a lot. It has also shown easier methods to build tools than some of what I have done in the past.It is perfectly matched to what I needed for a current tool I am writing.I definitely recommend this book for beginners and intermediates also if you have significant experience you may not find it helpful."
5,A must have for anyone who uses Office programs together!!!,"I would like to congratulate the author Michael Schmalz on writing a book that is actually beneficial to a great number of Office users who have to manually integrate data between programs. In the book's preface, Mr Schmalz explains his experience and how he came to write this book. If you are like me, you often read an Access book and find that many authors write based upon theory not practice and only serves to whet my curiosity. I then ponder the question I know this can be done, but how?In any event, I am sure that everyone who reads this book will find helpful information and ideas in all twelve chapters. At this time, you can sample chapter three in .pdf format available at: http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/integratingea/index.html"
5,My rating: PERFECT '10' .,Nothing could match this book as far as Unix networking is concerned. This book is simply great for all programmers who want to have a firm grip on Unix network programming. Stevens has dealt with all the topics keeping in view the knowledge level of the programmers who would be chosing this book for their help. I would suggest everyone to keep the 'Advanced Programming in UNIX environment' by Stevens by your side when you are reading this book. This book is again perfect'10' I must say. Just go and grab both these books!!!
4,IMPRESSIVE COLLECTION OF STORIES,I once met the author at a conference a number of years ago. I understand he has been a student of the paranormal since he was very young. He told me he was raised in a house that was haunted and had an out of body experience early in life. He had his first UFO sighting at the age of l0. He did a column called ON THE TRAIL OF THE FLYING SAUCERS for Ray Palmer's magazine and he used to correspond with Richard Shaver who claimed that he had been in the caves and been attacked by the dero. Its all very strange. Beckley tells it best in this book. There are literally dozens of stories about individuals who have met the inner earth dwellers. Its easy to read -- Beckley has a breezy style of writing. Its exciting and will keep you turning the page.
3,For people who do not have much money,Maximum good standats for the time it released but now it passed away but people who do not have much money can buy this product
2,product not as advertised,The item description indicates it is one bottle of Halston Z-14 spray cologne and one bottle of Halston Z-14 aftershave. What I received is two bottles of Aftershave. It appears someone along the line did a switch of product. It is more hassle than it is worth to return the product so I am keeping it but I am not happy about it.
3,"Truly Original, but not great","This is a solid album (or 2 ep's). As the other reviewer noted, it is well beyond a disservice to categorize Steel Pole as a metal band. This was a band that would play any dive that would put them up and blow people away. Then they'd sell their CD's and t-shirts for practically nothing from a backpack they kept on the side of the stage. They played towering rock riffs, but there wasn't the slightest bit of ""rock star"" b.s. about them. Steel Pole, with their tape loops and LOUD guitar, occupied a nice space in the indie rock scene. If you like the Butthole Surfers earlier albums, Scratch Acid, or the bands that came out of Amphetamine Reptile records, then this is right up your alley."
3,Earcuff 9DSS Sterling Silver review,"This earring looks great and holds in place, but the only bad thing is it hurts after awhile."
3,Simple little Thing,The item itself is simple just as shown. Just a silver colored metal band that is connected on one end and is completely bare on the other (slightly sharp too). I had to do some gentle reshaping so it wouldn't fall off my ear. Other then that it was fine. Comes in a little clear plastic case filled with stuffing.
2,"Cute, but not worth it","It is an elegant ear cuff and i received it in the cutest packaging and it was so quick! HOWEVER, I'm young and I like to experiment with a lot of different cuffs and earrings and this was wayy too plain for my taste. I was expecting it to have a rhinestone or two or some bling but it was just a plain circular loop, $10 could have beeen better spent somewhere else in my opinion."
1,Don't order from Brybelly,"For this dice cup do not order it through Brybelly. They will send u a totally different cup instead of this one. I wanted this style of cup and received something completely different. They would take it back, but at the loss of my shipping cost. Do not order with Brybelly."
5,Developing discipline and self control,I have found that this cd has been helpful in my everyday life. It tells you how to make discipline and self control a part of your everyday life.
1,Victory At Sea; no victory,"I grew up watching Victory at Sea on NBC. I cannot begin to express my disspointment in the product that I received. The thing that the people copying this DVD did not take into consideration is the fact that the storyline, music and Alexander Scourby's narration are all intrinsic to the successful telling of America's greatest naval accomplishments. I have owned the 2 hour VHS version for many years, so I know that a better sourcefrom which to copy does exsist. If there is anyone out there that can point me to a real DVD copy of the Alexander Scourby narrated 2 hour version of Victory At Sea, please speak up. As it stands now, Amazon.com should really sever all connections with the supplier of the Victory At Sea DVD. It is not even close to being acceptable."
5,Easy filing,Handle makes easy to hold and file. Used to smooth glass tile edges. Worked better than fine files sold for this purpose.
3,Crystal saver review,Had four fine crystal wine goblets to correct chips on the rim. Crystal saver did not completely erase the chip but I was able to smooth the chip out to make the wine glass usable again.
5,Helps to hide chips on cherished dinnerware,My wife has used the diamond file on a couple of her cherished and now irreplaceable Johnson Bros Dinner plates and bowls. Whilst the items can never be restored 100% the chips are much harder to see and we are very happy with the result.
5,Pleased as Punch,"I have put aside several plates and cups that have gotten chips on them, but did not throw them away. Then I spied the Diamond File on line and decided o order it and give it a try. It worked beautifully, was easy to handle and really quite fun to see my piece look so much better, and no sharp edges to be felt. So now my china is back in use and I could not be happier. My file was purchased through Amazon.com."
1,Stickers All Used,Totally disappointed. I bought the book for my 3 year old granddaughter who loves Caillou and loves stickers. Unfortunately all of the stickers were used in the book. Seller should have divulged this info prior to selling. If I could give zero stars I would.
4,On the Avenue,"Nothing heavy, this is a very enjoyable 1930s musical. The highlites are the musical numbers, since the songs are by Irving Berlin. While ""I've got my love to keep me warm"" is the best known, my favorite is Alice Faye's rendition of ""This year's kisses,"" and the Ritz Brothers have some very funny routines. Highly recommended."
4,The Cadillac of portable air compressors,"My new Thomas compressor, T-2820ST, is quiet enough to run in the house and is so well balanced that it is not too heavy to move around. Oiless, 5cfm @100psi, 100% duty cycle, 9 second come-back with capacitor-aided start(i.e. 12 ga. extension cords can be used); this is the Cadillac of portable compressors. The paint job on the tanks could be better and air fittings could be included, but those are minor issues. The overall machine is well-built and runs very smoothly. Proudly made in Wisconsin."
5,Excellent Compressor,"I was looking for an American made compressor. Thomas compressors are American made and are truely well built. I looked at the other Thomas compressors, but decided to get the double compressor instead. It was the best choice I could have made. It works excellent, using nail guns and I also spray with a Sata HVLP, using another small compressor pumping air into a manifold. I would high recommend this compressor above all others."
5,Well worth the money...compressor,"I've had this unit for 4 years now. Its waaaay quieter than all the others, and I have yet to have a problem with it. It's a bit heavy, but it can run non-stop in the sun all day long."
3,Works,"I bought my husband this band so he can wear it for work because I didn't want him to ruin the really nice one he has. He likes it, it is comfortable and the price is good for the purpose it is used for. It is darker than the picture."
3,Scratches easily,"Product came promptly, but in a velvet bag instead of a box, I find that odd. I don't think I have given mine too much wear and tear. Yet, it has gotten dull and scratched in the time span of about 3 months. Still, I am sure there is a polish to handle this small crisis. Other than that I say it is a great value, but I wouldn't use this ring as a marriage ring, invest in something better."
1,"Out of date, retired material","This class is no longer taught by the Red Cross. It was replaced effected 1/1/12 with Emergency Medical Responder. The material is several years out of date, do not use as a study guide for any current classes."
4,Halliwell's Who's Who in the Movies,"Great reference, but a little unwieldy. Big and heavy for a paperback."
5,DMT Diamond wetstone,"These are great particularly with stainless steel knives that seem to never want to hold an edge. With normal carbon steel knives they will put an edge on that one can shave with very quickly with little effort.They are fast, easy to use and can be stored almost anywhere. The are so good that I bought another just in case the company goes out of business."
1,a happy camper,so glad to get a program that was eliminated from my computer when i installed a new tower. my hallmark scrapbook download is the greatest.
3,ok Welsh comedy,"This movie is worth seeing for its irregularity alone. It's a Welsh movie with subtitles. It kind of reminded me of a Dennis Potter movie and it's not just the lipsynced scene. It has the same gritty comic feel.Once a movie house is closed a projectionist is in a stump. Another former employee comes up an idea to save the place, growing mushrooms. Frankly the last part was too cutesy eccentric for my taste but if you like digging up forgotten films it's worth a look. 2.5 rounded to 3."
3,"It's fine, in my opinion","I read the whole cineverse series, and found parts of it to be quite funny, even to be good comic book or Cartoon Network material; of course, that's just MY opinion."
4,Esio Trot: Clever,"This book was really good. I enjoyed it a lot. Now that I read it makes me want a tortoise. I liked the idea of Mr. Hoppy buying a bunch of tortoises, and switching them out so the tortoise is bigger. Everyone should read this book."
3,TURTLE LOVE-- LITE,"Humorist Roald Dahl and illustrator Quentin Blake have teamed up to produce a delightful senior romance. Now, if you are expecting to meet a character hint ed at in the title, forget it, for ESIO TROT is not a name--nor a person--at all. Elderly Mr. Hoppy has a secret crush on his below-balcony neighbor, Mrs. Silver, but how can he earn her gratitude-- and hopefully more--when he is too shy to invite her up for tea?Desperate to make a favorable impression the gentleman concocts a clever scheme to ingratiate himself with the lady. He courts her by appealing to her devotion to her pet tortoise, Alfie. With great patience and mechanical ingenuity this bashful suitor sets out to win his sweetheart. Literary Disclaimer: No turtles were harmed during the writing of this short, light-hearted read. For kids of all ages!"
5,Esio Trot,"Esio Trot has characters named Mr.Hoppy and Mrs.Silver. Mr.Hoppy went to all the petshops in town and got 140 tortoises to try to trick Mrs. Silver into believing that he made her tortoise, Alfie grow bigger. I like this book, it is cool and also it's nice to read. It is funny. I think Roald Dahl should write another book to let us know what happened to Mr. Hoppy and Mrs. Silver. The book is fun to read because of the characters."
5,a sweet little love story,"Esio Trot is a love story about a man, a woman, and a tortoise. The leading lady of the story has an obsession with her 11-year-old turtle, who as she claims, has a growing problem. Miss Silver's Neighbor, Mr. Hoppy, finds a way to make the turtle grow (by swapping him for increasingly larger turtles), thus winning her heart. This is one of the few books written by Dahl that doesn't really use the usual vile and icky humor. He must have been feeling romantic. It is very charming, and very cute."
3,A good book for young children or middle aged kids.,The main idea of the book Esio Trot is there is a woman named Miss.silver and her neighbor Mr.Hoppy( Mr. Hoppy lives above Miss.Silver in the apartment building. Miss.Silver is always complaining that her tortoise Alfie wont grow any bigger. So Mr.Hoppy tries to find a way to help Alfie grow bigger. Oh and did i mention that Mr.Hoppy loves Miss.Silver. I gave this book three stars because it was a small book and it didn't have much going on. I would recomend this book to people from 3rd to 5th grade because it wasn't one of the best books that i've ever read.
4,Mr. Hoppy's Luck,If you like short exciting stories you might want to read Esio Trot! My favorite charckter is Alfie. Alfie is a tortesio that Mrs. Silver likes. Mrs. Silver is a lady that Mr. Hoppy falls in love with. Mr. Hoppy is the man that lives right above Mrs. Silver. Mr. Hoppy wished that he could be Alfie because Mrs. Silver likes Alfie then Mr. Hoppy. Then Mrs. Silver started to say she wanted Alfie to start growing. Thats were Mr. Hoppy got his idea to buy 140 turtels and every day he would switch the tortioses every day right before Mrs. Silver comes home from work. The setting took place in the hotel but it was mostly in the hotel balcony. This book is fantasy because tortioses can't be that small. Here are other books by Raold Dahl The Withes and James and the Giant Peach.
5,Romantic Plot,"Secretly in love with Mrs. Silver is the desperately shy Mr. Hoppy. He adores her completely and believes he must do something to make her fall in love with him and tear apart some from her obsession with her beloved tortoise, Alfie. The two are neighbors in the apartment building and they rarely do anything more but have a small chat. Mrs. Silver is displeased because Alfie is small. She has heard of great, immense tortoises that people could ride on and she wishes Alfie would grow. So, thinking this as a chance to win over Mrs. Silver, Mr. Hoppy gives her a little special something to make Alfie grow. He has devised a wonderful plan to finally have the woman of his dreams.Esio Trot was an exceptional book, and a short one. If you are looking for a quick read, this is the book to choose."
5,Very entertaining read!,I read this book to my 3rd grade students a few weeks ago. They loved the book! We followed up by completing a group book report project found on [...].
5,Awsome album with an even better message!,"This is a truely great album. The message Travis Wyrick presents is an upfront discussion of his faith, given to us in the format of some of the best industrial music to date. The songs are well written, and the lyrics are beautiful. The songs are in the style of NIN, Ministry, and (early) Filter. This is one of the best Christian albums ever!"
3,APS = mediocre,"The sleek, tiny size of this APS camera is what made me purchase it after my 35mm camera broke. However, after going through over 6 rolls hoping each one will turn out better than the last, experimenting with different film (kodak,fuji and various speeds), lighting (indoor, outdoor, sunshine, cloudy), and developing sites, I have yet to develop a set where the pictures are not grainy. I am now looking into going back to the 35mm, more specifically a Minolta or Olympus."
5,THE BEST IN THE WEST !!!,IT IS SO GREAT TO USE ITS HARD MEDAL COVER AND IT'S VERY DURABLE AND CAN EASILY FIT IN YOUR POCKET.
4,"Compact, sleak and versitile","This little camera has taken a lot of great photos for me. The image quality is pretty decent considering its size. The main advantages of buying this camera are:1. Its portability.2. 3 different shot formats: regular, HD and panoramic (which in the right situation I find is a must).3. Very easy to use!There are a couple of features which I haven't found to be that great though.1. The zoom is 2 1/2. Not altogether useless but not that powerful either.2. If you take a lot of different pictures: panoramics, HDs and regular all on the same role prepare to pay a lot to get your film developed. 3 roles 2 25s and a 40 cost me around $ to get developed. So just be prepared.Over all this is a quality camera and well worth the money for anyone looking for a point and shoot."
4,Now I'm wondering ... and hoping,"I received this is a Christmas Gift ... the user manual is heavier and thicker than the camera, but the instructions were pretty straight forward, and I got it all ""programmed"" just fine. Half-way thru my 2nd roll of film, the view-finder quit ... no image in the finder, just blackness. I called Canon Customer Service and they were flabbergasted, but found a service agency fairly close to where I live, and said it would be fixed under terms of warranty. Good ... wonder how long that will take. The only other feature I would have liked is a ""bulb"", or ""time-exposure"" setting for lowly-lit interiors (castles, cathedrals, etc.)"
1,Can't depend on it working when you want it to.,"I bought the Elph (at about twice the current price) for my wife and one for each of my three daughters! My wife's worked at first and then would work inconsistently (usually NOT just when you wanted the graduation picture, prom picture, etc.). I sent it into the company three times. The first time they couldn't find anything wrong, the second time they fixed something and charged me, the third time they couldn't find anything wrong. In the mean time my daughter's cameras started having the same problem--sometimes they would work and other times they wouldn't! I don't know what to do about it--I don't feel like shipping them in again as this didn't help. We now have four relatively expensive cameras that are undependable!!"
4,great camera,"It's really a great camera. So small you take it anywhere. The only complaint I have is red eye. Even with the red eye reduction flash, lots of pics still come out with red eyes!"
5,awesome little camera,"My husband bought this camera for me for our first Christmas together, and I love it. It is so easy to use, even for the first time. It takes great pictures, too. I really recommend this camera."
3,Totally useless,Didnt work when I received it. Can't open the film compartment..waste of money? Sad cuz I loved my old one
3,"Looks great, pictures grainy :(","I bought the Elph2 as a Mothers' Day gift for my wife. She had always wanted a small film camera. I usually take my Sony Mavica or Minolta Maxxum to snap pics, but I figured it's about time I quit hauling those around everywhere.We first used the Elph2 on vacation in the FLorida Keys. Lots of sun and surroundings for nice pics. Well, we used the film that came w/ the camera, I think 100, maybe 200. All the pics look grainy, in light, or not. Well, my wife went and bought a box of 5 rolls/200, oh no. So I had to take all of those pictures(for her sake) Now I have 400 in there, hoping they will be better. I have read through the manual thoroughly, so I know how to operate it correctly. I really hope the pictures improve with film speed, or I will be returning the camera."
1,Not All It's Cracked Up to Be,"I decided to get the Elph2 after seeing rolls and rolls of incredible photographs a friend had taken with his original Elph while touring Europe. I have been disappointed over and over again as each roll I take continues to come out with the low-quality pictures some APS cameras have become notorious for. Still, the sleek design and incredibly small package make it decidedly difficult to give up... if only it took as fabulous pictures as it's older brother!!!"
4,yeah,"very much enjoy the insyderz. thought there would be more songs, description wasnt clear but still like it"
4,"Good, but limited.","This is a really nice compressor, however it is exceedingly slow so usefulness is very limited. I have an old 1982 1hp 12.5 gal compressor,and an old late 80s 3/4hp craftsman tankless portable compressor. I also have a portable air tank. I emptied the tank, then filled each compressor with air and compared times to fill the portable tank to 90psi. The results:Craftsman 1hp: 1:47Craftsman 3/4hp: 3:30Thomas 1/2hp: 8:00Yes that's right, it took this compressor over twice the time to fill than even a 3/4hp tankless. My advice is get the larger model, unless noise is foremost concern."
3,Good Opportunity Blown!!,"Finally a Comprehensive Staples Anthology is here, One that includes Gems from their Early Gospel Period along with The Stax Classics AND ""Let's Do it Again""...However...The Single Versions of these Tunes are used, not the Longer, decidedly Superior Album Versions; Regrettably I Must Reccomend Against Purchasing this Set, I Wish I could Love it, but perhaps with all the Consolidation going on With Big Record Companies We will get a Proper Staples Collection Soon....Still Waiting..."
4,Delightful as Always,"This was a happy little romp with another one of Evanovich's quirky self-effacing heroines, comical side-kicks and family members, and egotistical yet strong and loving heros.In a world so full of strife, ""The Rocky Road of Romance"" is a wonderful little mental holiday for anyone reading it or, like me, listening to it on long commutes back and forth to work."
4,The Rocky Road to Romance is a SMOOTH read!,---another great love story! I highly recommend the audio version. The story goes by quickly. This book is an entertaining read!
2,Rocky Road,"Well, actually this was somewhere between hated it and didn't like it. I like Janet Evanovich, but this was a silly, vapid attempt. I trade audio books with a friend and we discuss them. When I asked her opinion of this book she said she had listened to it but couldn't remember anything about it. That about says it all...not memorable except as a ""don't reread this thing"" sort of effort."
5,Exactly What I Wanted,I ordered an audio book. I got an audio book.It came in a timely manner in great condition.Happy with Amazon.com once again.
2,Way overpriced,"Wow,For this much money you could buy two better quality Sony flat panels and two dual P4 or Athlon systems and have change left over for software. And they would be faster! Give me a break, Apple needs to join the real world. This is why I gave up on Macs - Apple just wants to rake in the cash. They are as bad a monopoly as Microsoft - no competiton so they charge a bundle and deliver poor performance."
1,"Great Idea, Poor Execution","A series of short essays on California history is a great idea for a book and I admire the author for following through on it all the way to self-publishing. However, the essays themselves are poorly written with numerous layout and typographical errors. One of the most irritating examples of the writing problems is when the author randomly throws in a paragraph or two unrelated to the current essay. In a book where the essays run 3-6 pages each, you would think he could stay on topic."
5,An outstanding compendium of Californian history.,"Classic Tales In California History is an outstanding compendium showcasing 36 fascinating, true tales, including America's Only Emperor; The Bear Flag Revolt; Wheelbarrow Johnny; The Japanese Internment; Russia's Bid for California; Snowshoe Thompson; and The Chinese Tong War."
5,perfect bag.,"I just love this bag, i use it in the winter,spring and summer.It's a knapsack but at the same time it looks kind of elegant."
5,Pocket-size perspective,"A friend sent this book to me when I finished grad school, along with a note: ""Upon discovering the complicated & ugly muck of the world, one of my first questions was 'what now?' This book helped."" It's the meditations of a Jesuit priest, who is surprisingly concrete in his examples of things from life that pull us down or stress us out, and a new way to think of them. I read a chapter a night before bed, and it gave me a lot to think about, and a lot of perspective. Helped me realize what's important and what's not so. Helped me deal with things, some small, some bigger."
4,"Life changing, but why pocket size?","AS OF JUNE 12, 2012 THIS BOOK IS IN REGULAR BOOK FORM, which is amazing... I'm buying that version now.I am not a Christian, a Jesuit, a Buddhist, Hindu, Muslim, Taoist, etc. I am all these things and none of these things. My favorite books are ""The Buddha Said..."" by Osho, ""A New Earth"" by Eckhart Tolle, and ""Awareness"" by Anthony de Mello.If that statement resonates with you, then this book will resonate far better (I'm no guru!).This pocket version is great for travel, and since the book itself is small in words, but enormous in content, it works well in a small format. I do, however, recommend getting the new full size version ""The Way to Love: Meditations for Life [Paperback]"". Just copy paste that into the Amazon search bar."
3,"Great Book, Excellent Service","I received my book sooner than expected and in very good condition. I appreciate this quality of service. The book, The Way Of Love by Anthony DeMello was a pleasure to read. Thanks."
5,spiritual,As always Anthony De Mello has a lot of spiritual wisdom to offer. Good insightful advice to follow. The book is written in short stories packed with spiritual wisdom.
3,De Mello uses his great allegorical talents and practical advice to raise personal awareness and fulfillment,"For those that haven't heard of Anthony De Mello, this book is a great introduction to his work. It's part of the self-help classification of books and takes the reader through everyday scenarios and reflects on the deeper meanings these can have. Each chapter starts with a quotation from either the Bible or some famous philosopher, then the chapter builds on this. The magic of the book however, is De Mello writing style and allegorical talents. He takes deep and abstract propositions and presents them in easy to understand 'scenarios'. For example, his explanation and advice on the route to true happiness, is easily understood, memorable and immensely practical. And this is the cornerstone of this book - it's a practical guide to higher personal fulfillment and contentment."
4,"Really good for axes, garden shears, pruners, woodsmans pal","I bought this to take a few nicks out an old axe I own. Did a great job. I didn't want to remove the entire 1/8"" of metal, just make it so that the blade was sharp enough to clear limbs with again. Black side first for about 10 minutes, blue for another 5 and then a red one for final touch up. Worked like a charm.Then the wife was complaining about these old cast iron grass sheers, 5 minutes under running water with this tool and grass flies like hair shavings. I didn't even bother to put the blade into a vise.This set takes way too much metal off for my good kitchen knives though, so unless you are working on Grandma's old high carbon steel knife made from a Ford leaf spring, I'd go with a less course grit for that chore."
4,Diamond File,"I like these diamond file sharpener, and it's handy to have two different roughnesses to sharpen my tools. I use them for pruners and knives, and while it takes a little while to get the hang of using them (you generally have to take apart your pruners to get the best angle), these Diafold's do the job well and don't easily break, though they wear down pretty fast if you use them a lot."
1,good luck,"I have been buying dmt products for probably 20 years, when I can afford them. They have always been over-priced for what they are. But on the other hand, they last forever, right?At least they used to.In other reviews of dmt you will find some people complaining that basically all of the abrasive rubbed off in a very short time. That is what happened to me on this one."
5,Knife sharpening heaven,"An over the top successful upgrade to kitchen knife sharpening. Read the directions do not push down hard, let the too do its job at its own pace and you will marvel at how well this thing works,."
3,Ring bound.....,"To all students! Don't get confused with ring bound. I thought it was different. All this ring bound style of book is just loose leaf paper that is three whole punched but instead of lined paper, it is the textbook. You would have to buy a binder to store the book in.Other wise, this book seems easy to read and well set up!"
1,useless,I bought this book in the hope it would shed some light on the problems with Quicken for Mac 2001. Quicken charges for almost all phone support - which is usually answered by people who are not knowledgable. So - I was looking forward to the book filing the gap.WRONG! It is a primer at best - albeit a long winded one. It doesn't even tell you have to back up and restore files! I found this particularly astounding since our financial files and knowing how to back up properly is so important.I almost don't think the woman who wrote this exists - the book is that useless and just a shill by Intuit.thank goodness Amazon makes returns so easy. I'll just hit the help button on the mac - that is when Quicken figures out how to make help work.
1,SCAM ALERT!!!!!,"I was reading the ""reviews"" and couldn't help but notice something troublesome. Just look at the review from Tammy (Coral Gables FL) Then click the ""read all my reviews"" tag. Notice how ""Tammy"" has reviewed all of the authors books - and only this authors books? Notice how ""Tammy"" gave all of this authors books a 5 star rating? Gee, I wonder who ""Tammy"" really is????Please Donny Lowy - don't assume we are all too stupid to figure out who ""Tammy"" really is!"
1,Lowy Needs Some Spelling & Grammar Lessons,"Did no one edit this book before it was published? This book is completley riddled with spelling and grammar errors on nearly every page! Do his eBay auctions have this many errors? Very unprofessionally written book. No one is perfect, including myself, but geez, if you are publishing a book, have someone read it and correct your errors first!The information in this book is nothing earth shattering, either. eBay newbies may find it somewhat useful, but the same information can easily be found in ebay's tutorials, or better yet, on their community forums-for free. Save your money!!!"
4,Nice gift,Not sure why the ratings are so low. Its a nice scent really. I purchased the bottle as a replacement for Dad's old one- a tiny little thing. You defiantly get you're moneys worth when you order through Amazon.
1,PU,"I was really thinking that Halston Z-14 was a steal at the price. The delivery of the item was fine but the smell of the product just isn't what I expected. I used it once and then immediately ordered some Calvin Klein Free which has a lot less cloying fragrance. Now I have a practically full bottle of Z-14 that I won't use. I also noticed, after my purchase, that you can buy the Z-14 at WalMart for a low price. I can't recommend the Z-14 fragrance. It's not my cup of tea. It appears that you do get what you pay for."
2,A bit too strong for me...,"Very satisfied with Amazon's incredibly fast shipping!I knew nothing about this perfume prior to making the purchase on Amazon. I just bought this cologne on a whim from Amazon since it had good ratings and a great price! I really was excited about this perfume and wanted to like it but find the fragrance too strong. I sprayed twice on my chest and gave myself a headache at work.Not only is the fragrance too strong, it is unfortunately not my taste either.Two months after making the purchase I have noticed that amongst other colognes I own (Lacoste Red, Lacoste Essential, Armani Code, Bvlgari) this is my least favorite and I have used it only once or twice.I suppose it is a hit or miss when you buy fragrances online without trying it out, but as it had great ratings on Amazon, I am a bit disappointed at this purchase."
5,I love it,"i loved it then and I love it now!back in the days of being the number one go to guy this was my cologne, lets bring back some memories together."
1,Horrible Throwup.,This is very much for OLDER dudes(55 and up). I felt like vomiting when I smelled it. Its like show polish. Please do not blind buy this one. You either like this or hate it.
4,Smells good,I've been using Halston colonge for a while now. It smells great and most of the females that I hug or come in cloe contact with seem to agree!!I'll keep using it!!!!
1,Buyer Beware -Unhappy-and it CANNOT be returned to amazon !!!!!!!!!!!!,"Buyer Beware. I have been using this cologne for years. This is the first time I ordered it from Amazon, and it has a very weak and very different smell from the other bottle I have purchased from reputable stores in the past. I think it may be a generic, watered down, Chinese counterfit knock off version of Halstron Z14. AND-- GET THIS - IT CANNOT BE RETURNED. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT. ""For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com. Customers should dispose of hazardous materials according to Local, State and Federal regulations. Customers should contact their local government or local waste company for directions on how to dispose of Household Hazardous Waste."
3,smell doesnt last,I have a older version of this bottle and the newer as well and I smell is good and all but it doesnt last more than an hour.
2,Major malfunction issues!,"I would give this camera five stars if not for the fact that I've had to send it in for repairs three times in the 2.5 year that I've owned it. When it works, the Canon Sureshot takes incredible pictures. The zoom and flash are great, and I am especially fond of the red-eye feature. However, my camera kept having this weird problem where it would rewind film when I was in the middle of the roll, and then I'd try to put a new roll in and it would rewind the film again. Each time that happened, I had to take it in for repairs. I was lucky that I lived close to a Canon repair facility at the time, otherwise I would have been really ticked about having to pay to ship my camera to them so many times. The repair people were really nice about everything and my camera has been working well for almost ten months now (knock on wood! I'm sure that will change as soon as I post this review). My next camera will NOT be a Canon, however. I've learned my lesson."
3,Problems Galore,"Like many of the other reviewers, I too have had numerous problems with this camera. The first one I owned had to be returned after only 3 months due to a problem with the zoom lens having trouble retracting in addition to the lens cover not closing in some cases. The second camera has the same problem, this time, the camera lasted about 8 months. My suggestion, keep this camera away from any humidity or moisture. That seems to create the problem. Don't even think about taking pictures on a rainy day, even with an umbrella!It is so unfortunate, since this camera takes such great pictures....."
1,Try again....,"Very weak vocals by Riner. Strong songwriting and vocals by Palmer. Hopefully, the sophomore attempt will be much better."
2,CD,"This problaby is a good product for a Germany family, mas I was looking for something to my nice sing in english."
5,Good Secondary Battery,"I recently bought 4 of these batteries. The strangest thing is that two of the worked and the other two would not charge. When the battery charges it will work fine. For six bucks, you can't beat this product. I'm about to place an order for two more. Hopefully I can get them to charge."
4,Mary Black's Family Quilts: Memory and Meaning in Everyday Life,I was somewhat disappointed that there was not a more extensive use of primary source materials. This is an easy book to read and understand.
4,Velvet Valley,"It was a real pleasure to watch. I would strongly recommend this movie if you, like me are one of many looking for the Velvet Alley in any form possible. This is the hard to find Rod Serling movie Velvet Alley which any and all Rod Serling officianatos are looking to own. It is not the best visual quality tape (old tape, grainy) but what can be expected for a movie that is over 50 years old and not digitally remastered.However it is a wonderful look at one of Rod Serlings best and semi-biographical pre Twilight Zone works. I have searched for years on where and how I could obtain a copy of this movie; it was well worth the wait."
5,Very informative!,I run a kangaroo web site and already knew a lot about kangaroos before I acquired this wonderful book. This contains everything you might ever want or need to know (or not) about kangaroos!
2,It's been done so many times before.,"This book offers the same info that has been written so many times before. So what makes this book any different than any other I read? It's basic. Set goals, write them down, set a time line, and so on. Sound familiar?"
5,Sharpens great!,"I bought it as a stocking stuffer for my husband and he reports that it works great! He's a guy's guy and a carpenter, so I trust =tat he would really know if it was useful or not."
3,"It works ok, but ive seen sharper.","This sharpener worked pretty well at first, but after a while, it looses some of sharpening capabilities. Seems to get a little dull. The size of the stone is a little small as well. You cant get a good angle on it to sharpen your whole blade. Though its too small to sharpen on, its way too big for a keychain. I have since moved on to bigger and better stones, and use this one for camping. I now normally keep this one with my collection of smaller sized knifes and works well with those."
1,Very Portable but Fragile Sharpener,"This is the little brother of the DMT diafold. Very light and small. I keep one on my keychain. The extended length when open, is an aid to keeping a constant angle. I have never had one come apart but I suspect they are not as durable as the diafold and are not available two sided (two different grits) which of course, would be heavier. Mine seem to be rust resistant for use with water to wash away metal dust which would otherwise accumulate on the surface. These Mini Sharps are not for any work heavier than edge maintenance.UPDATE 9/7/2012:-- The molded-on flanges of the plastic handle broke off when I tried to unfold my Mini-Sharp. No more than normal force was applied. It is now in two pieces. I want an item like this to be dependable. Lowering my rating to one star."
3,It's REALLY tiny.,"This product is very very small. I'd say it's the length of my thumb, and about as wide (at the most) as two fingers. It's extremely small. It does the job, but I'm forever nervous of slicing off my fingers."
5,"Thin, light, inexpensive and convenient.","I usually keep this in my key pocket... the pocket within a pocket on the right side of my jeans. I open and cut down boxes at work quite often and need to frequently touch up the edge on my knife. It's as easy to hone a good knife with this hone as it is to swap razor blades, less expensive and less waste as well.I believe this is a 600 grit hone, it will only fine tune a knife already in good condition. The same style of hone is available in more coarse grits. I use a 400 grit weekly to repair my knife, and the 600 daily through the work week to keep it sharp.The hone is very light, only a few millimeters thick, very pocket friendly.I haven't tried to hone a massive Dundee style knife on it, but I think even that could be done quickly and safely if you're careful and don't rush."
4,Graet value for the money,"While there are many cameras out in the market, this one is a great value. Not only do you get a high quality Canon product, but also a great camera that should last you a long time.It is such a great value, I am going to purchase one as a gift!"
4,Pretty Good,Very good cheap film camera. I'm a beginner to photography but this is pretty easy to use. VERY good value for it's price
4,Clear as clear can be,"Thisi s the first review I've written. I've got a stack of business books. Most are filled with common sense advice, advice I really do not need and a waste of my [money]. BUT, The author of this book provides clear examples, examples that can be used right away, advice worth buying the book for. I am impressed./KK"
5,Effective,I found the book to be quite effective. The ideas can be put into operation right away and the results are equally as fast. jl
4,Sharpener,The plastic handles could be stronger but for the money they work well. This unit folds like a bail song knife.
3,cracker jack handle,DMT you need to make the handle better. the handle is very bad quality. However the sharpener does work good.Havn't broke the handle yet but i'm sure it won't last.
5,This is a great stapler.,"I am very satisfied with this product. It arrived quickly and in good shape. These staplers are great, work very well, never jam. I recommend it to anyone! Ronnie."
3,Good,"I waited longer than I thought I needed to(2-3 weeks after I received another book ordered the same day), but it was still within the delivery window."
1,Not what I thought it would be,"I purchased this item thinking it would be great quality performances. There was really nothing special about it and I was disappointed at the songs that were put on ""the best of"". I have seen and heard Anthony Burger play some amazing arrangements and none of them were included on this album. If you are looking for a great cd of Anthony Burger, check out his hymns cd. Awesome."
1,Never got it because it was lost in the mail,"I ordered this dresser after many hours of research because I wanted something I could use as a changing table, without the looks of a changing table. I was very upset when it never got delivered (the crib I ordered at the same time came right away) and I was told I could get a refund or get the black version because there weren't any more of the white version. I order from Amazon all of the time and this is by far the worst experience I've ever had! I have been ordering other baby items from other sites just to avoid this situation again because I need the things I order in a timely manner."
4,You get what you pay for,"This dresser is pretty good quality assemble-yourself furniture. It's not as solid as real furniture, but it's also not $400+. Assembly was pretty straightforward and all the pieces fit well. Packaging was good - no damage from shipment. I expect it to last 3-5 years."
2,Typical romance,"Short typical romance that authors turn out when they have to publish quickly. Rand is arrogant & dominating. Lucy is stubborn, amusing & spunky. Quick, short read."
2,Mostly advertisement,"Very little of schipperke specific information, and some of what is there is in error, and lots of common sense dog handling. This book seems to be written off a template.Also a huge amount of product placements. Not worth the read, nor the purchase. Rather get Melanie Coronetz ""Schipperkes""."
4,Absolutely Amazing!!,"Incredible mix of blues, pop, rock, and a tid-bit of country. The heart that comes out of these performances is unmistakable. I am looking for big things to come out of her!"
3,I'm really torn on this book,"I'm so torn.On the one hand, this is a simply-written, repetitive book about the real start of spring - a flower in the snow - and how all the animals react to that.On the other hand, the artwork is a little uninspiring, and I'm not certain black-and-white is the color scheme to go with here.Definitely read before you buy."
3,the unhappy child but happy parent,"I think this book is really cute, but my son, who is three, is not thrill with it. He thinks its boring. Maybe in a couple of years he will enjoy it more."
1,rip off,"this thing is tiny, im not sure what kind of a knife this thing sharpens, mabe its meant for smurfs, im not sure."
3,Out of date but a reference.,"This book it out of date if you look at it. The first few pages I browsed through said it was illegal to have marijuana in all states. I'm thinking, ""You forget that if you have it for medical purposes it's legal."" I decide to check out the date of this book and it is 1996. A lot of stuff has changed since then. Not too great but things have changed. I would look at this book to see an old perspective of how martijuana is viewed and can still be viewed today in some aspects."
3,Dated,Good reference book but dated case law and content. The author may consider doing an undate with all of the new medical marijuana and state allowing use. So for whatever reason Amazon is not allowing the standard word minimum?
5,Love it Love it Love it,"I absolutly love this Happy Heart. I had no problem with the purchase, delivery, etc. I will for sure use amazon.com again and again. I was ver please at the prompt order and delivery of my wonderful perfume."
2,yawn...,"I had very high hopes based on the reviews of this dvd.I was very disappointed in both the commentary and camera angles.I found this dvd to be really lacking. I had hoped to learn more about transitions and flow to help with my practice.Visually, the set is dreary and very bland.I will be selling my copy on Amazon asap and purchasing Chuck Duff's dvds instead."
1,Too slow and choppy - not a fluid practice,"I thought this yoga video was way too slow to be a good workout, and didn't flow well. The poses call for being held and the lack of movement make it very choppy. I would prefer more than one person on the screen as I couldn't relate to the made-up model."
1,Item Didn't Work,"What a pain the ass this has been. The item was order and shipped in a timely manner. I install the board and nothing. Genie tells me there's something wrong with the board. I contact the seller through Amazon, and the seller answered back within a few hours. Seller stated that a new board would be sent out. I received confirmation that USPS had been notified that a package being sent to my home was ready to be sent. I was provided a confirmation number and I've been waiting, and waiting, and waiting. Today is the 31st and I haven't received a thing in the mail. So perhaps I will receive this sequencer board eventually and get my garage working again. I will most likely NEVER buy another Genie product or do business with this seller again!"
3,It works sorta...,I have had this installed for about 2 months now and it occasinally malfunctions so I have to unplug the garage door and then everything works better. It seems to work good with the Genie Garage door opener buttons but occasionally when I use my homelink buttons in my truck I end up having the problem of it only partially opening the door and once this happens none of the openers seem to work right not even the one wired in at the wall. It works fine with the buttons in my Acura but not in my truck... Not sure the issue. It was cheap enough that for now I will just deal with it but it does get a bit fusterating sometimes.
2,not so good,"Honestly, this book didn't do much for me. I never got interested in reading it, and just learned by playing and watching poker tournaments on TV."
3,Depends on your game....,"If you're an average to good poker player, you won't get much out of this book. But if you're one of those poker posers that has sprung up over the last year, I'm sure you'll think this is the greatest book ever written. So if you suck, be sure to read this, so at least you'll be able to talk the talk while you're getting cleaned out at the tables. If you're good, spend your money on something else, or save it and buy in for 15 bucks more the next time you play. Am I the only person who hates the poker bandwagon jumpers? Well, at least they're easy to beat in the casinos. I'll let them hang around as long as I can take their money with ease."
4,This won't be the only book in your collection...,"As a relative newbie to the world of poker, I was looking for an easy-to-understand introductory text to the game. The book worked well in explaining the essentials (hand rankings, object of the game, rules for the variations of the game, etc.). The starting-hand tables were actually pretty good, too (especially for a beginner).However, one must keep in mind that this book isn't meant to be the sole title in your poker library. The book touches on many, many topics (ranging from strategy to history to professional poker). But, it doesn't cover any of those topics completely (nor does it intend to).If you understand the game and have some experience, you're probably pretty safe to move onto a more advanced title. However, if you're looking to get your feet wet, Poker for Dummies is a definitely worth checking out."
2,A Problem With Focus,"The problem with this book is that it lacks a focus. A ""Dummies"" bookshould instruct beginners on a specific subject. But here the subjectis too broad.This book tries to address *all* of the following: casino poker, homepoker, online poker, strategy, tells, bluffing, money management, worldseries of poker, poker personalities, tournaments, video poker, and more.And being a reasonably short book, it doesn't cover any of these topicsatisfactorily.There are some good bits in the book. However my advice is to determineyour objectives for reading a poker book and find one focused to thatobjective."
3,"Typical ""Dummies"" book, meaning an OK starting point.","Just like any ""For Dummies"" publication, it has to be ""X"" number of pages long, so ""Poker For Dummies"" follows suit (ha ha) by saying the same things over and over for several pages, i.e., there's a lot of filler here.And much of this material can be found online now.Still, if you are looking for an easy-to-read bound introduction to Poker games, then ""Poker For Dummies"" (like any ""For Dummies"" book) is a decent place to start. As an aside, it's kind of funny how the chapter that talks about computers is so dated, given the hardware described, but software-wise, it still appears true that Wilson poker software is the best out there (too bad Wilson software hasn't updated their graphics since this book was published).My advice would be to get this used - for the price of this book new, you can get at least two good used books on the subject through Amazon Marketplace."
3,a little less..,"Book was sold as ""new""... the front cover was creased and had some wear on the corners. But, for the price i paid it is acceptable."
2,not so great,very basic...dont waste your $$$...get something to give you an idea of proper strategy
2,Not really for dummies,"This book failed to meet the criteria it was written for. In other words the whole point of the ""for Dummies"" collection is that a complete layman can pick up a book on any subject he/she is not familiar with and get a good idea about the whole thing. This is not the case with this book. Although it cover the basics it does not cover all the basics before going on to the next subject. A person with no idea about Poker and Poker variations would get confused - the book would leave too many open questions for an intelligent reader who knows nothing or very little about Poker.I can not recommend it for beginners - which is who this book should be for."
3,There's not much here,"I love ""Dummies"" books and usually start with one when I want to learn something completely new. I have played poker recreationally most of my life, and been a consistent winner--because my competition was even worse than I was. I even won in my sole foray into a card club--because I was lucky. I had never played Hold'em, however. I wanted to learn more than just the rules of the game and get an introduction to some of the theoretical poker concepts that I knew were out there. This is the wrong book for that.This book is just too elementary for anyone but a total and complete novice. The only ""take away"" for me was an understanding of what playing tight pre-flop means for Hold'em. The commentary on post-flop play was way too simple-minded.This book spends too much time explaining things like tournaments, the World Series of Poker, and the Internet. I am still looking for the book I want."
3,"I love Hill's ""Dalziel/Pascoe"" series, but this one not so much","I think that Hill's Dalziel/Pascoe series is the best police procedural series I've read. The writing is literate and erudite, the characters are fully-fleshed (and actually develop and change over the years) and the plots are page-turners. There is some variation, as I like some more than others, but none are failures.Dormouse is a stand-alone novel, and I just don't think it works, perhaps because I don't find the protagonist believeable, and since the book is basically about her development after the loss of her husband, if she doesn't work as a character, than the book doesn't work.Also, the book feels far more thrown together than some of Hill's other works; perhaps he just hadn't quite hit his stride.I debated giving this only 2 stars, but it's not ""bad"", it's just so unimpressive coming from Hill. But he died recently, and I'll err on the side of generosity for this one."
2,VERY Basic at Best,"If you have used any MS Office product and are remotely familiar with topics such as Cut and Paste, Save as..., basic formatting, or anything similar, save your time, your money and your sanity by steering clear of this book. 99% of the information is available under the Help menu.This book is only good for those just entering the computer world."
3,"Great for the beginner, but that's about it.","If you are looking for in-depth instruction on the more advanced features in Microsoft Office 2003, this is not the book for you. If you've never used a computer before, this will be a great reference. In either case, however, the humor is cheesy and often exhibits extremely poor judgment on the part of the author. If you're easily offended, find something else."
2,"flawed design, poor surface","let me preface my comments with the fact that i have the 'fine' version of this sharpener...the extra-fine sharpener i received does indeed sharpen my 1095 knife... however, there was some form of 'goop' on the sharpener's surface that impeded sharpening until i scrubbed it off...also, and this is common to all DMTs in this form-factor:the design is flawed, as when you unfold the sharpening surface, nearly three-quarters inch of the surface is *below* the holding plastic tray! you can't use more than 25 percent of the sharpening surface area! Doh! i supposed one could carefully sand the half-inch of offended plastic, but then you risk not being able to pin the surface open...i would have preferred a pinned hinge so that the entire surface could be used when unfolded... a BAD design and cheesy plastic 'swivel,' along with a munged surface on my product received give this item two stars..."
2,wears out too quickly,This product works great for the first ten sharpening or so but then the stone gets worn down too much that it is below the metal grate below it. At which point the product is pretty much worthless as you cannot remove the metal. Only got it to make my order qualify for free shipping so not too disapointed with this junk but do not suggest it. Search for a better sharpener. this wears out far too quickly to be useful.
3,rolling back pack,"Cute backpack, my daughter loves it. So far seems durable. We have only had it for a month. The only downside so far is it does not stand up, it falls over, so it has to lean against something."
4,Great Buy,"Granddaughter loved her backpack made her first day of school special! Liked the covers for rollers, hard to find item for little girls!"
2,"Too big, too loose, not a good swoosh","I was looking to replace the net that came with my basketball hoop. That one had survived about 5 years of year-round exposure. This net from Spalding installed easily and appears to be constructed with decent material. However, when ""testing"" it I noticed it seems longer than other nets I see. It also seems too loose (wide or big at bottom). The ball just kind of goes right through it. I was hoping it would grip it for a moment but the opening seems very large. The bottom should be narrower than it is. I also don't get a satisfying sound on swish shots. I was hoping for a more solid 'net' sound but it's just kinda nothing, since the ball pretty much goes straight through it. Hopefully the sun and some rain will shrink it or something. It's not horrible. It is a basketball net, but I will likely replace this one soon with something shorter and tighter at the bottom."
3,Close but no cigar,"Very good net for average home use. We are a recreation center looking for a comparable, thicker net replacement. We will keep looking."
4,"The same stories, but not the same language","I had heard that these were good, especially the version of ""Taming of the Shrew"". Everything I'd heard was right! Shakespeare is often ""updated"" to different time periods, but these are the first I've seen that actually change the language. Don't get me wrong, I love the originals, and there are snippets of the Bard here and there. What makes these so good is the inventiveness that went into choosing the modern settings. They will leave Shakespeare fans wishing for more."
5,"Brilliant, impactful retelling of the Scottish play featuring stellar performances","Probably the best of the Shakespeare Retold series, ""Macbeth"" features Keeley Hawes as Lady M and James MacAvoy in the title role, with stunning performances all around. By eliminating the wars, armies and infighting, and setting Duncan, Macbeth, MacDuff, and Malcolm into the tight, insulated world of a gourmet restaurant, the story hits hard at the cruel results of trusting in mysterious diviners. Macbeth's poor self esteem and resulting arrogance are his undoing, his tragic flaws, and this version makes the plot and themes extremely easy to understand while being truly engaging. I have watched it several times and find something new and fascinating in it every time. Riveting!"
4,Quirky and entertaining,"I'd seen trailers for this series on another BBC series I bought and was intrigued. The Shakespeare plays selected are updated to modern times and with some definite changes to language and story line, if not to the overall theme. Closer to the original than, say West Side Story, but you get the idea. The success of the transformation varies - The Taming of the Shrew is definitely odd, although worth the viewing if only for the sight of Rufus Sewell as a cross-dresser. It's not Upstairs Downstairs, but definitely original in a really English way."
4,A hat trick,"As an English professor always looking for new perspectives on Shakespeare for my students, I watched these enthusiastically. Aside from Midsummer, which focuses too much on Theseus and Hippolyta's marriage and is very dark,these are terrific. The best stars in the English firmament make up these casts. The best is Shrew -- Shirley Henderson, Harry Potter's Moaning Myrtle all grown up (metaphorically, she's a tiny person) is a miniature nuclear bomb, and Rufus Sewell is absolutely edible. The elevator scene is hysterical. Twiggy is also great as her former model mother ushering around her current model sister, Bianca. I've been waiting for these on this side of the pond for a year now!"
2,When Is Shakespeare Not Shakespeare?,"I'm dismayed by all the positive reviews for this forgettable and pointless exercise. The contemporary settings for these four plays are clever and fun, but the adaptations remove what makes Shakespeare special -- the language. Dumbing down his plays into bland contemporary prose -- and tinkering with the plots for TV reasons and, sometimes, no clear purpose whatsoever -- makes them rather dull. Shakespeare Re-Told offers few insights for those who know the plays, and for those who don't (i.e., students), the unfortunate message is that everything's dandy when you cut all that ""funny language."" No, when you do that, it's not Shakespeare anymore."
2,A disappointment - more American than British Idioms,"For someone wanting to learn more about British idioms and speech, this book is a great disappointment. Nearly 99% of the idioms listed are common American usage (e.g. ""hold your horses"") and provide little new insight or help in understanding our U.K. counterparts. In the entire book, there are only a a small handful of uniquely British idioms (e.g. ""play gooseberry"" or ""dance attendance""), and there were some glaring omissions. There was no mention of ""sticky wicket"", for example. If you want to understand the Brits, I recommend you look at Margaret Moore's Understanding British English."
1,plastic crap.,"looks like it might be some kind of metal handle in the pictures provided. it isn't, it's plastic, and not even good durable plastic, it's the really brittle kind. it feels cheap. while i can make no statement about the sharpening stick itself (i'm sure it sharpens fine, it's diamonds silly!) it just feels like a poorly made, overpriced, plastic piece of junk. may be okay for the junk drawer in the kitchen (yours, not mine), but i doubt very seriously it would hold up more than a week in the sticks. in fact, i'm not even gonna use it once, that's how crappy it is. also, gpknives.com (who i bought it from for $22.50) will only give a credit for returns, which is usually what companies that sell crappy products do. i will be returning this. oh, and how about the guy down in the reviews that just LOVES his DMT serrated file sharpener. dude, don't insult our intelligence by posting advertis...er...i mean reviews for a product you are clearly being paid to hawk."
4,Great for serrated blades,"I picked this up to sharpen a bread knife, as well as a couple of serrated folding knives.The taper works great, allowing you to work the right spot on the rod based on the size of the serrations. When finished, I also use it to lap the back of the blade at a very very slight angle (nearly flat) to debur any leftover shavings.I can see where people complain about the plastic handle feeling cheap - it does. However, it does not get in the way of using the tool. The fact that you can fold the handles over to protect the diamond is a plus, and I prefer that over a more solid fixed handle.I definitely recommend it. My only reason for giving it four stars is that I feel it should be a little less expensive. At ~$25 per sharpener, it makes buying the whole set a rather expensive proposition."
4,Convenient Portable Serrated Knife Sharpener,"This DMT Diafold Sharpener is a good tool that comes in a convenient package. As other people have stated before in thier reviews, the folding plastic handle does feel thin and reletively flimsy, but I do get the impression that it will stay intact for some time if treated with care. This is my first sharperner specifically for sharpening the serrated areas of my knives. It works well and didn't take long to perform the technique properly. I wish the file/sharpener was a little longer with a more gradual taper, or if they made it with more than one file/sharpener that was a different taper or thickness. Other than those suggestions for improvement, this product works great."
5,Excellent Sharpener,"Really Liked this sharpener, quickly put a razor edge on all my backpacking blades. Kukri, Leatherman Mutt, and my CKRT as well as 3 other camping knives. The compactness is nice."
5,Razor sharp edge's,"I ordered this based on my need for poratbility and utility. Other reviews echo the reality of this fine product. Yes the handle is plastic and feels flimsy, but you probably won't be using the handle as the jaws of life. The sharpening system took in 5 swipes on each side a razor edge to a old Columbia river $15 knife. It sharpened my kitchen knife to a razors edge. This is a serious high value item to have around the hosue or in a back pack, Great buy!"
5,Pocket knife sharpener,"I have carried a pocket knife for more than 70 years and I liked this sharpener very much. I had tried some other sharpeners for my pocket knife and was not satisfied. I think the round diamond rods and some of the other ""quick and easy"" sharpeners tend to distort the blade of the knife so that it becomes concave along its length. A flat sharpener like this one will keep the blade cutting edge straight so you can use the knife until it wears out, but the shape of the blade will not change. I have the coarse and fine combination which seems to work well for my use. I also have some very fine Arkansas stones that I can use if I want to refine the edge but that does not seem to be necessary for a pocket knife. I also have some very old carborundum stones but most of them wear so that they are not flat and become more difficult to use. This sharpening stone combination is not cheap but it may be the best choice in the long run."
1,Dull by SECOND knife,"I do not recommend this item. It is advertised as being able to last a long period of time without dulling and this was not the case for me. I took it out of the package, sharpened one knife, and midway through the second knife, I noticed that the course side was smooth. Sure enough when I felt it with my finger there was almost no abrasive material left on the sharpener. The total time I used the product before it became useless was 20 minutes."
3,"Sharp, but not sharp enough.","The product works. It requires no oil, but you won't get near the same edge that you will from a traditional whet stone."
4,Very good but lacking quality plastic.,"So, Im a chef and really going to use this product. I really like this tool. Using it with the guided tool.The quality of the grint is really good but the handle feels and looksreally cheap, bad quality. Thats tobad on such a otherwise nice product.Also the handle grinds against the grint when you fold it which isn't that nice either.But for the price it's very valuable, hopefully the plastics wont break but Im not to surtain about that."
4,"Works great, keeps my knives all super sharp.",This is a very useful and easy tool to use to sharpen knives. My only complaint is that I keep forgetting which surface (red or blue) is the fine vs. coarse grit.
3,Nickel?,Why is there a cancer warning about nickel in the product? Is there a risk to the person using the sharpener if she inhales dust?
5,FINE COMPACT SHARPENER,"I've had this sharpener for a few years now and use it several times a week, mostly on kitchen knives. Lets me keep a razor edge on them. I used to use it for my tools but got a larger (4""x10"") DMT for that, so now it lives in a kitchen drawer."
5,Impressive. Even I can sharpen with it!,"I have a saying. ""Give me your dullest knives, and I'll make them duller!"" I stink at sharpening knives. Always have. But since I purchased the DMT I've been able to keep all my blades in shaving sharp condition. It does the job fast, and thats cool, because I can be impatient. I have found that the fine side does most of the sharpening, and is adequate for most needs. The lite, small, compactness of it makes it great for any trip where regular sharpening is required, ie. camping fishing, backpacking. So for all you unskilled types (like me), you will be happy buying the DMT diafold sharpener."
4,"Good product, decent price, American made.",It's light weight and has gotten a good edge on my pocket knife. doesn't need oil and it should be perfect for backpacking. Very happy that it's made in the USA!
5,Love the Diafolds....,"I am a big fan of the double sided Diafold. They are too pricey for some folks taste, but as they say, you get what you pay for. I would recommend this item to a friend. In fact, I already have."
5,Handy for the Pack,"A very handy knife sharpeing tool for your pack or drawer. Small and light weight it folds up into a compace easy to stow package, while still being large enough to be useful."
2,Flimsy Tent,"The Eureka Solo Spitfire UL is certainly light. Light on durability. The mesh, and there is a lot of it, got damaged (from packing???) after only one night on the trail in the Sierra. I never used the rain fly on my trek; but when I tried to set it on my lawn for cleaning, the fly ripped due to the inferior design that uses two vertical stays instead of a pole at the feet. Also, there are no pockets for gear storage. The price has also dropped like a rock since I bought mine. What does that tell you?"
4,Good tent but....,"The Spitfire UL is a good tent, but the stated weight of two pounds, four ounces is grossly inaccurate. The tent actually weighs two pounds, thirteen and one half ounces, and that's with the included stakes which most will want to replace with larger, stronger, and HEAVIER ones. Perhaps the understated weight refers to the tent without the fly, but unless you plan to use it only in the desert, that would not be recommended. But, aside from that inaccurate representation, it is a good and relatively light tent."
4,A lovely soprano voice.,"Surprisingly, Nimbus has not removed as much of the scratchiness of the original recordings as I would have preferred, as they have done with other artists. That being said, Nezdanova's voice is charming and d,ightful yo listen to, and shines through the defective ness of the original recordings. Well worth owning this cd."
4,Pretty Cool,I like the name of the band. Sounds alot like Led Zeppelin. They kinda rock out like them too. Really cool artwork.
2,disapointment,"I received the camera as a christmas present and was very very disapointed with the results--they were constantly blurry and out of focus , pictures from special events came out poor. i began buying disposable cameras because the quality came out better then my Canon! i will be buying myself a new camera very soon-"
3,"sharp pictures, poor reliability","I've had this camera for about three years and had a love/hate relationship with it. It's sturdy, fits nicely in the hand, has a good zoom, and takes sharp pictures, sharper than an Olympus Stylus Zoom 80 that I tried. But I had problems with washed-out skies that should have been blue, and a red-eye reduction that never worked at all. Canon fixed the sky problem (free) but didn't fix the red-eye problem, claiming wrongly that it was working. And now the RT (real-time) feature (for photographing my daughter playing sports) doesn't work at all."
1,Bad Camera,"I purchased this camera and I have had a lot of trouble. In fact, I'm looking to purchase another camera because the Canon is not working. The camera took good pictures, but there were so many mechanical flaws, it was not worth it. This camera was not cheap. Problems I experienced were camera would not take picture right away and the camera would sometimes decide not to work. The lens would not open sometimes and this camera has been a big disapointment."
1,Flashing H. Serious design flaw,"My wife and I had one for about a year, then got the flashing H. The problem could not be fixed. However, my wife decided to purchase the same camera, and again, the flashing H after a year of light to moderate use. I think I'll buy an Olympus now.Canon, get your act together.Consumers, don't waste your money."
2,"When it works, it works great...","I got this camera as a gift from my parents, and was delighted to find that for what it is, it worked quite well. It's not a $[...] SLR camera, mind you, but the pictures turned out nicely; very crisp. About a year after I had it, I too got the Flashing ""H"" of Doom. I followed the instructions in the owner's manual to no avail, fiddled with it, and finally resorted to the internet to find out if other people have had the same problem. From what I've read, it's not worth fixing due to the cost of repairs and the fact that it usually breaks again shortly afterwards. I'm going to save the [$$$] it would cost me to repair it and put it towards something nicer.I would recommend people avoid this camera and purchase something more reliable."
2,Flashing H,"I was originally quite pleased with this camera...well mostly...except for the fact that it is hard to catch those ""special moments"" of my newborn since there is quite a time lapse between clicking and the shot. But now, after having the camera for just over a year, the camera has begun flashing ""H"" and, even after changing the battery and cleaning the connections (as suggested by Canon), the zoom is still stuck in the extended position and the camera is out-of-operation.After trying to access Canon's website for information I have found that they do not even list this model in their model history...and access to technical support is not available online for service problems such as this.When consulting with the various online camera tech sites I was told this is a Canon flaw...and it is not exclusive to the Sure Shot 105 Zoom...as it has been seen in the Elph also.Guess I'm going digital now...need my cameras to last more than 1-1/2 years!!"
2,Disappointed,"Like another review I read, the camera took great pictures but I took it to the beach, and some how sand got in the lens. When I took it to the repair shop to be repaired they said the warranty was void because it doesn't cover sand damaging the lens (although judging from the reviews it seems to happen quite frequently). Secondly, the price to get the camera repaired was almost the price of a brand new camera, so it wasn't even worth it. Thirdly the repair shop advised me never to take it to the beach again, but what is the point in purchasing a camera for vacations if you can't even take pictures on the beach?????"
1,Problem!,"We too have had problem with camera. Been in use since Sept. Good pictures, but in middle of a roll of film it started flashing H. After reading about other problems here I doubt its worth fixing..."
5,Excellent camera!,I have no idea why these people had problems with this camera. I took some fantastic pictures with this camera untill it was stolen this past February. I read someone complain about pet red-eye and they are uniformed. You cannot prevent pet eye reflections in ANY regular camera. It is a completely different problem with pets eyes than humans and has yet been fixable. At least that is what I was told by a professional camera person. I am hoping to get a new Cannon but I plan to try a newer model.
2,A fantastic camera...until it stops working,"My SureShot 105 provided me with 3 years worth of beautiful photos. Then one day, the camera failed to turn on. The camera was never dropped, shaken, or exposed to moisture, and the battery was new. A camera shop estimated a repair cost of $75.I lamented my camera's short life until I saw the ""made in China"" label on the box."
4,Built to last,"I have had my Sure Shot 105Zoom for aboutt 5 years now and have been extremely happy with it, especially since it has been used and abused in that time. The quirky delay when taking pictures is the only reason I gave it 4 stars. It was weird at first, causing some of my pictures to be blurry or completely messed up... but once I got used to it I never had a problem. I never used the red-eye feature so I can't comment on that. I pretty much always use the green ""Auto"" selection and have never had red eyes in any of my pictures.The only reason I am looking around for something new now is that it seems through old age and heavy usage, it's starting to go through batteries pretty quickly. Pictures still turn out great though, and I just have to make sure I have a spare battery in my case. I can't say enough about this camera, it has definately served me well. I'll definately purchase something new in the same ""family"" of cameras!"
2,"When it works, it works great...","I got this camera as a gift from my parents, and was delighted to find that for what it is, it worked quite well. It's not a $... SLR camera, mind you, but the pictures turned out nicely; very crisp. About a year after I had it, I too got the Flashing ""H"" of Doom.

I'm going to save the $...+ it would cost me to repair it and put it towards something nicer.I would recommend people avoid this camera and purchase something more reliable."
2,Busted,"This heater was a disappointment. The automatic function had issues and it eventually brokedown completely within six months. I would constantly battle with it, trying to keep it on, but it would automatically shut off after 5 minutes of use. In short, I do not recommend this product."
1,Not good at all!,"Received this product and when I went to plug it in, it started to smoke and didn't work after that. We threw it right in the garbage.."
4,wonderfull disc,Wonderfull cd....sting can get long winded at times but some of his insights are very enlightening.....haven't found all the tarot cards yet..if anyone has a how to guide please email me! thanks
5,The Light of the Torah,"There are several very old Texts in the Kabala, besides the Zohar, the Sefer Yetzirah and a series of Midrashim dealing with Esoteric concepts among others, there is the Sefer HaBahir, or the Bahir as know through Rabbi's Kaplan book. This book is classic in the language and concepts of the time of the Tanaim (and before): the sages that composed the Mishna. Because of it, it is not without a poetic flavor that what really does is veil the content. If you are looking for operational more practical knowledge of the Kabala, The Sefer Yetzirah of Rav Kaplan will do better for you, or The Structure of Creation of Shlomo Weiss if you are looking for the cosmological outlook. Yet if you want the feeling and have some comprehension on the Topic, this is one of the sources and you can be thankful to Rav Kaplan for daring to publish this."
4,JR's Grooves,"John ""JR"" Robinson has put together an all-star lineup of some of the worlds best musicians. Great production and a winner all the way around. The man has lent his talent to virtually anybody & everybody in the music business........from Quincy Jones, Rufus/Chaka Khan, Michael Jackson, Steve Winwood, Barbara Streisand, Elton John and the list goes on & on..........Now he gets a chance to stretch out a little & show you what he's got up his sleeve. The man can play!!!"
4,Inexpensive protection for your Sandisk,"I have no complaints with this easy-to-use mp3 protector. I guess I have less lint in my pockets than some of the other reviewers, because my case never has stuff stuck to it. And it does a great job of protecting the mp3 player from drops, bumps and/or random splashes of rain or liquid. The only down side is there is no protector for the screen. However, you can buy film to put over the screen itself quite easily at places like Radio Shack."
4,It works,"NOt Much to say, but it works for what it is intended for. biggest problem is it makes it hard to use the selection dial and arrow tabs because of its thickness, but thats kinda a good thing too.IT protects the unit, and it protects it from accidental selection of the selection dial"
5,Glad I purchased this nice case.,"I bought this MP3 player case to provide a little protection for my player. It turned out to be really nice. Not only offers some shock protection but has a nice feel to it, rather than the feel of cold metal or glass."
2,Have dust on your floor? Here is a way to pick it up!!,"IT IS A DUST MAGNET!!!! I bought it and said ""it cant be to much of a dust magnet"" WRONG. It is a cheap vacuum cleaner ( why isnt it with the Vacuum stuff)I still gave it 2 stars because it protected the player, but not the screen (that should be the most protected Right?)Not much of a choice for covers for your sansa inless you spend more money. The case that comes with the sansa works better then this piece of junk, and its free. DO NOT BUY THIS, trust me!!!!!!"
4,Nice Product!,"The Sansa e200 Silicon Case does it's job. It's awesome compared to similar products - keeps the sansa from sliding around in the car, keeps scratches away etc., easy to put on and off, pretty much indestructible. Only disadvantage about it is the look - it takes the originally noble and shiny look from the sansa. some might also find that it is a little bit harder to reach the buttons - i didn't have this experience myself."
3,Worth the Money,"This cover fits great on my sandisk player. Does not have a front display cover. I bought PDA screen covers online, cut to size of my MP3 display, now I have good protection."
4,Second Skin,"A nice snug fit. Provides a good layer of protection. The only downside is trying to use it with armbands. Most other holders (such as armband holders) are too tight to allow you to leave this on, so you need to take it off to use the other holder. The problem with armband holders pretty much stopped me from continueing to use it. If that won't be a problem, than I'd say its a great second skim to protect the player."
2,Meh... it's a cover.,Gets in the way of the buttons. I don't use it. Not to mention that it picks up all kinds of lint and garbage on it.
4,got it as a gift,I purchased this for my girlfriend as her first mp3 player and she found it easy to use and has enjoyed it.
3,one major problem,"The protective case attracts dust horribly but it does a good job protecting the player from harsher treatment; however, the screen which is one of, if not the most important part of the player, is not protected."
2,"magnet for fuzz, dust, etc","I've had silicone covers in the past and never have I experienced the problem I did with this one--every piece of lint, dust, crumb, dirt etc CLINGS to this and I tried wiping it off, but it just slides around. gross! waste of money."
3,SanDisk E-Series Case,This case provides basic protection for your E-series Mp3 however it lacks any type of fastening device to attach it to your person or vehicle.This problem can be easily remedied by cutting a 1 inch x 2 inch window in the back of the case then sticking a like size piece of male Velcro through the cut out to the back of the Mp3. You can then make a belt loop or arm band out of the female Velcro and attach the device to it. I just use mine while I am driving and find that the Velcro attaches it's self nicely to the cloth seat material in my truck.
3,"Not bad, but not great.","I have been using this item for some time now. Like others who have rated this item, it does attract all kinds of debris. It rests comfortably in my backpack, but looks terrible because of all the lint and other things that have been picked up by it. It does provide excellent protection, though. I dropped my e260 a few times and it bounced like a ball with no damage. I just wish it did not look so bad with all the debris stuck to it."
2,silicone case,"i bought this case when i bought my mp3 player while it does do its job protecting the player i was not impressed with it otherwise the rubber actually attracts lint, crumbs, hair and it doesn't really keep the player very clean i wouldn't say it was worth what i payed for it"
2,Good Stress Relief,Like others have said this puppy is a dust and hair magnet. It attracts stuff like flies to honey. It is good stress relief in that I enjoy squishing it up in my hands when I am having a bad day. It does not seem to have much latex in it as it does not trigger my latex allergy. It is soft and squishy and it does add some bounce protection for when you drop or bang your player. That is not enough reason to buy this item so just say no. If you want to protect from scratches buy a skin sticker instead.
3,"Nice protection, but dust and hair magnet",This case offers nice protection and has a good feel to it. But I happen to have a dog and the way dust and hairs cling to this thing is unbelievable. I was thinking of buying 2 of these things to use in place of the old tape type hair pick-up rollers.
1,Everything sticks to it,"I bought this case because it was cheap but I haven't used it because dirt and cat hair just CLING to this case. The case doesn't even have a clip so it's pretty much useless. Yes it will protect your player, sort of but it bulks it up when you have to carry it in your pocket. I bought the DLO Action Jacket for the Sansa SanDisk e200 series which protects the screen and has a clip and armband. The DLO case is the way to go!!!!"
3,Shop around first!!,"Go to the Sandisk website, they have huge list of cases that you can buy. They range from a ruggedized rubber case to the Griffin Disko which is clear, covers the screen and has flashing LEDs embedded in it. Lots of choices to pick from, take a look before purchasing this one."
1,Piece of crap,Don't buy this piece of crap case. It is a flimsy piece of silicone with no plastic face to really protect the item.The carrying case that comes with the unit is fine.
2,"It helps, but it isn't the best","Will it help if the player falls to the ground?Probably.Does it have a way to attach to a carrying case, armband, etc? NOIs the price worth it?It depends, B&M; stores it costs $12-$15, Amazon much lessWould I buy again?NO, I would get another type of protector that has an armband, or other way to carry my E260"
1,DO NOT BUY,"I agree with some of the buyers. This item is a waste of money. I dropped it on my rug, went to pick it up and it was all dirty. I would love to return it but unfortunatley I can't."
3,"It works, But we really want to protec the screen ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡","They do the job. Protects all the product from scratches. But the screen is fully naked..... So, What are you going to do with a brand new case and a screen hard to use because the scratches?..... Don't waste your money...."
3,Protector,This protective case is good because it's non-slip rubber texture may prevent loss of the MP3 player. The price is too high.
2,SanDisk Sansa e200 Silicone Case,Simple device for protecting the Sansa e200 series MP3 player. Protects corners from scratches and dings. Not as protective as an after-market case which I ultimately bought.
3,A Silicon dust magnet,Good protection for the player. Only problem is the dirt attraction. My son keeps it in his pocket and it looks like a dustball.
5,Best purchase I have made all year,"$15 bucks for 20 awesome tracks! best deal out there. Slightly Stoopid is simply amazing. They mix reggae,punk,metal,dub,acoustic all in one CD. You cant compare them to anybody. They have a sound of their own, and are the realest band out there. They dont give a.... they put out their album how THEY wanted too. For that I love Stoopid. They love music and their not gonna sell out and produce crap. Stick with this band and you will be musically pleased daily. Peace Love and get off your ass and buy this kickass album!"
5,reggae.dub.good times,if you are an ese loco you should have this one of course... i love it- personally i think the boys should do all their punk songs on one cd and all the dub chill reggae on the other cd. but thats just me. its fun times though. 4 sho!!!!!
5,Slightly Stoopid-Closer to the Sun,"This long awaited cd he blown the lid of the genre i believe Slightly Stoopid has created.The smooth easy flowing riffs mixed with the steady beat of drums hypnotise the mind.This Cd in my opinion is just mind blowing.Slightly Stoopid keeps pushing the envelope and strives to put out the best music they can for the fans, and at the same time keeping away from major corporate labels.I suggest that if you are a Slightly fan to purchase this and if you have not heard of them this is a great cd to begin listening to.Trust me ... you will not be disapointed."
3,Slightly Stoopid - 'Closer To the Sun' (Artist Direct BMG),"Even though this genre isn't my cup of tea,I still found 'Closer...' to be a decent find.Sort of dug the way they fuse together old school reggae,funky blues,rock and punk.Some of the better cuts here include ""Babylon Is Fallin'"",""See No Other Way"",the disc's single ""Somebody"",""This Joint"" and ""Zeplike""(nice acoustic guitar).Line-up:Miles-guitar&vocals,Kyle-bass&vocals,Tim Wu-sax,Ikey Owens-keyboards and Adam-drums.Might appeal to some fans of Sublime,Mighty Mighty Bosstones,Goldfinger,Bob Marley G.Love&Special Sauce."
5,Slightly Delicious,"This is the best album I've heard in years. From there fast guitar picking, awsome vocals, and MindBlowing Beats. This album kicks total A#$. The highlight of the album is the whole thing. There is no bad songs. What first drew me to this album is its awsome cover art. Anyone that has heard Slightly Stoopid buy this album. Anyone that has never heard them before this is a best buy.-The Movie Guy"
1,Closer to Garbage!,This is by far the worst album slightly stoopid has ever made.I can not believe how weak this album is.Their edge is gone.I really thought slightly would blow up one day and make millions. I guess i was wrong. They suck now and it sounds like no future success for them. You can find my copy in the trash where it belongs.
2,Interesting yet Boring,Some monumental observations considering the time it was written. But a very difficult read that requires concentration and will-power to finish.No-one has ever accused philosophy of being practical.
5,A Must Know For All Who Desire To Vote!,"Aristotle's constitutional theory is the most important aspect of this book. Every high school world history should become familiar with the 6 forms of government that Aristotle identifies, and every college poli-sci student should commit Aristotle's analysis into their core knowledge.Of course Aristotle lived in a time when social norms were different. Much of what he writes applies to a different age, but the constitutional theory of government remains a timeless set of observations -- especially important in our times."
3,"cheap, but noisy","After about two days, the coils have become loose from expansion/contraction and the product makes a good bit of noise. It's difficult to keep in my bedroom while I'm trying to work or sleep. The unit does heat, though... for now. I believe the product has been phased out."
2,Sure-Set Digital Heater Fan,I have been disappointed in this heater. I bought two of them and have the same trouble with both. The heater shuts itself down and then has to be unplugged and cooled down to reset and restart.
4,Great book to learn different techniques,I have to agree with some of the other reviewers. This is a good book for beginners to learn some of the basic techniques to create mosaics. There really are not any patterns in the book that you can duplicate to begin working your craft. But it will provide you with a great initial knowledge base to get you on your way.
4,Overwhelming with ideas,"This is a lovely book, written well, easy to follow instructions and inspiring. I keep it at my desk in my pottery gallery so I can study and sketch ideas while people browse here. I am glad I bought this, and recommend it to anyone wanting to learn about creating mosaics. I like the structure of the book."
4,OK,"This is a comprehensive book on mosaic techniques with lots of good detail. I was looking for something that would give me ideas for everyday projects rather than instruction on how to lay floor tile, tiling outdoors, etc. Good book for what it aims at--just not what I was looking for."
3,Not for beginners,"While the book does offer the standard mosaic-making advice, the alphabetical encyclopedic format makes it frustrating at times. If you are a beginner, as I was, you won't know where to start. 'Planning', 'setting up your studio', and 'equipment' are all topics, but if you don't know exactly what to look up and in what order, it won't do much good. And if you're more experienced, you don't really need big color photos of safety equipment.The book's strength is in topics such as borders, andamenti, and design techniques. As for nuts and bolts info such as the actual direct and indirect methods, I found Leslie Dierk's book 'Making Mosaics' to be FAR more informative.Overall I found the encyclopedia 'gimick' to not really be very helpful."
4,"high on technical, low on ""eye candy""","as other reviewers state, this book is a wonderful reference work on mosaics-how to on many different types of mosaicing. BUT, if you are looking for lot's of beautiful pictures to inspire you or for projects, then I wouldn't suggest this particular book for that.Also, as someone who does a lot of free form or ""wacky"" type of mosaics-like with broken china, 3-d objects, shells, etc-that is NOT covered in this book. For that, I'd suggest Backyard Mosaics by Sheerin or Crazy Mosaics.This book is more the ""formal"" style of mosaics.Overall, for lots of solid Mosaic info-I'd give it a 4 stars and recommend it for your Mosaic Reference Library."
5,From library rental to wanting to own it !!!,"I rented this book from my library and am now here purchasing it, because I loved it so much. It is a great collection of basics, supplies needed, various techniques, common mistakes, ideas and inspirations, instructions, classic mosaic artworks and lots of colored pictures, (which even have my daughter asking me when we can try to do some mosaics). Hobby store: here we come!Even if you just want a new addition for your library, its definetly a great buy."
4,Bait and Swithch,"The book itself is excellent. I have read it but purchased it as a gift for a friend who's about to raft the Grand Canyon. However, although the price of the book was listed as $8.15, the invoice in the book said $.99. I could have chosen an offer at $.99 but was unsure of the condition, so paid the higher price. I was very disappointed to see the $.99 invoice in the copy that was sent from American Book Fairs."
3,Good coverage of the unknown parts,"The chief strength of this book is that it fictionally recreates the ""missing"" scenes from the fateful Colorado Rivery journey of Glenn and Bessie Hyde. However, Michaels apparently wrote her book before ""Sunk Without a Sound"" was published. If she had been able to read it first, numerous mistakes concerning known facts would have not been made."
5,Favorite,"Love these picks. They just feel right and, to my hands, offer more picking control than other picks I've tried. Love the 204 too, though for different tones/playing styles. Great stuff. Between the two, these are my fav picks."
3,Be My Shelter,It's a nice CD for easy listening and worship but it wasn't the one I wanted. I was looking for a favorite song and thought this was it.
2,bad dog food,"This food does actually give my dog a nice coat as promised, but it gives him terrible indigestion. I can't speak for all pet owners, but noone should pay this kind of money for dog food that isn't healthy for their pet."
1,TOO EXPENSIVE FOR WHAT YOU ARE GETTING!!,"The ad-wizards at Nutro not only raised the price on their dog food but also dropped the amount in the bags by 5 pounds. I am in the process now of switching my dog over to a cheaper better quality product. You can be sure that the prices will continue to go up because if they didn't hedge against the spike in commodities the first time, they are too stupid to do it a second time either and will be passing on the cost of their stupidity in the form of an even more reduced bag size with an increase in price. MARK MY WORD.12/20/2009 FOLLOW-UP: I was right. Price jumped to $60 a bag from the high $30's. Beware, company is currently being investigated."
3,Just OK.,"The movie was just OK. It wasn't the movie I was searching for, but it was still ok for the horse lover in me. I don't think I would recommend it to a friend though because it just didn't wow me like some movies have."
5,My favorite,"I have been using this toothpaste for a couple years now and it has quickly become my product of choice! I originally selected it because of my sensitive skin. This product doesn't contain any harsh chemicals and still does a fantastic job keeping my teeth clean, fresh and white!"
5,Excellent,"Lilith is the best, I wish she had more books out. She writes with such humor, her book had me rolling in the floor laughing at several points. But she is also serious at the same time. She would be a great teacher, I know, everyone would love her. I hope to see more books of hers come out, and I'd love to even meet her some day if I ever venture into Salem. She writes from a perfect ethical perspective, demonstrating the true meaning of Wicca."
5,Wit and Witchcraft on every page - a must-own!,"Whether you're a novice or a lifelong Witch, this book belongs on your bookshelf! It's not just for the romantically challenged, either. *grin* Basic advice and advanced rituals are included. And don't miss the chapter on ""White Trash Love Spells,"" with the recommendation to invoke the power of Elvis! This book mixes common sense advice, ancient spells, and brilliant wit for every Witch."
4,Worth a Try,"I bought this book because of the good reviews.It's well written in a witty tone everyone can understand. The spells are not hard to do. You can tell just by looking at the ingredient list that the spells have a real basis and history. Some require more ingredients than others and you may have to search for them on the internet, but overall it's worth a shot.I like the author's writing most of all. She's hilarious."
1,Salem Witch's Book of Joke Spells?,"If you take this book as a joke, it is absolutely wonderful. However, if you buy this book looking for real, honest spells, then, well, you've bought the wrong book.Mainly, the spells that are listed are purely psychologically healing rituals, but not really spellcraft at all. Many of the spells that are listed are good for a laugh, but not to seriously try.Just the opinion of this witch, of course."
5,Unique Insight into Dirty Work,Great book! Perry provides a unique insight into a job we all often ignore. Perfect book for those students interested in the Sociology of work. The book also includes a historical view of the development of the San Francisco area in the 60's and 70's.
2,Was NOT educational,"I thought this product would introduce my husband and I to new ideas and techniques. It failed horribly. It was just like watching mild porn. I didn't learn anything from it. Oral sex, strip teases, talking dirty, and sex toys are not new to me. The positions were also VERY common. I was expecting them to come up with something that everyone hasn't heard of. I was greatly disappointed in this product."
2,not what i expected,"the first DVD of the 3 was boring. felt like i was in sex ed all over again. I am 28 but me and my wife fast forwarded it at least 5 times then ejected it and threw it away. The 2nd dvd was better but still lame. there is a ""seduction"" chapter. do youself a favor and skip this chapter. Unless you have a yaght and a private island, its pointless. the 3rd DVD i didnt even bother watching. was a complete waste and do not recommend this to anyone that has the sex knowledge of an 8th grader or more."
1,Sexplorations,I thought these videos were a disappointment at best and have not even finished watching them. Did not at all meet the marketing description of what they were supposed to be. Will never purchase anything from this group again.
2,Not recomended,"I wasn't looking for a porn, but it's lack of good scenes. Ugly cast. You have to watch it just one time, and done! You'll never gonna see again. However, it gives you a good tips."
4,The Better Sex Video Series,This would be great series to watch if you are newly weds or just want to learn some new techniques.
4,sex,"Very informative. Perfect for those unexperienced or unsure of how the male or female body responds to arousal.Quite ""graphic"" for those a little ""shy"" about ""nudity""."
4,"Not their best, but good!","This CD isn't as good as Impel's ""Omnidirectional"" CD, but is still worth a listen. I'm not sure whether they acquired a new vocalist for their second album, but on ""Writhe in Pain,"" the lead singer's vocals are much more clear and less of a hardcore shriek than they are on ""Omnidirectional."" The highpoint of this short CD is definitely a cover of the Beatle's ""Don't Let Me Down."" Also note, ""Green"" is the same song (though differently arranged) as on their next CD. All in all, decent stuff."
3,"Great for the price, but not the best sound","I bought these speakers to listen to my Ipod. They work wonderfully for the price. The set up was a little complicated with 2 wires going from each speaker to the small subwoofer, a power cord, and a cord for your headphone jack. The unit sounds good with all speakers are close together, but the sound gets very top heavy when the speakers are separated. The subwoofer is so weak, that I have to have it on max volume to detect any lows. My other complaint is that the speakers can't get very loud and/or very high without hearing crackling or noticeable distortion. The unit is very stylish, but doesn't have ""a rich, wide ranging sound."" My suggestion is to get this unit if you don't mind compromising sound quality for price and space. But if you are willing to compromise, I'd get the ""BOSE Companion 2 Speakers."" They are still relatively cheap in price for a media sound system, and sound great."
4,IgorK,It's good for sound quality and I like it for a speaker slim design. Remote control is outdated as far as it's not wireless and I can't find a good spot for it on my desk.
5,Not for the faint of heart....,"The sub-title of HAW!! is ""Horrible, Horrible Cartoons."", which pretty much serves to warn away the easily offended. Brunetti serves up 90-some odd (Very odd...) 1 page gag strips that read like ""The Far Side"" on crack. No topic is taboo, but if you're open minded, and looking for a LOT of laughs at everyone else's expense, HAW!! should fit the bill. Fans of Lenny Bruce, Bill Hicks, Sam Kinison, Richard Pryor, et al, will find Brunetti's subversive humor to be a perfect counter-point to the misplaced political correctness of the day. I can't rave about this book enough."
3,This is a disturbing piece of work,"""Haw!"" isn't completely tasteless, but it's definitely not the apex of comic art either. It's not even really the apex of tasteless comic art--for that, see Johnny Ryan. Somehow his work comes off as funnier and less gross than Ivan Brunetti's. Maybe it's because ""Haw!"" is mostly single panels?Anyway, if you read this, I hope your tolerance level is set very high. Brunetti goes places I don't even really want to think about. I will be returning this to the friend that loaned it to me the next time I see him."
3,It's worth a look,"With all the trash out there, here's a movie that tries. That's worth something. The kid is good. And if Colbert can do his thing, why not Costner?"
2,boring movie that i could not even finish watching,this movie is horrible. it is boring and i was unable to finish it. the only reason why i watched it in the first place was for a political science class.
4,ENTERTAINING,"I LIKED IT AND WATCHED IT BECAUSE KEVIN COSNER WAS IN IT. IT WAS ALSO KINDA FUNNY. DIDN'T LIKE HIM NOT SHOWING UP FOR FATHERS DAY AT SCHOOL, BUT LIKED THAT HE LOVED HER SO MUCH, EVEN HIDING THE FACT THAT HER MOM WAS EITHER A DRUNK OR AN ADDICT."
2,"If you want Costner being funny, watch Tin Cup","Starts off possibly being worthwhile. But the over the top political improbability ruins some potentially reasonable social commentary I would have liked to give it at least a '3' were it not for this. Now a movie like ""Man of the Year"" is funny and makes a decent commentary at points...worth a '3'. Or ""Wag the Dog,"" which handles its improbability well while making its point."
3,Not The Comedy It Was Said To Be,"I was really excited about the opportunity to watch Swing Vote. I adore Kevin Costner, and I was really curious to see his portrayal as ""the nobody who becomes the voice of everybody"". From the previews, I expected a lot of laughs and comedic antics, but those were far and few between. It was a bit more serious than I anticipated and I found the father's lack of interest in his own daughter, heart-wrenching.It's been pinned a smart comedy. It's been said that Swing Vote is a rather hilarious look at our presidential electoral system. It's been said that it's a light-hearted feel good story. Personally, I didn't find it very funny at all. The laughs were far and few between. However, the acting was good and the ending was perfect! If all you do is fast forward to the ending, as you listen to the speech made by Ernest, you've got your money's worth.I received a complimentary copy to review."
3,Zzzzzzz......,"This movie is one of the worst Kevin Costner has made. It didn't hold my interest. I found myself multi-tasking during the movie because if I had just sat there, I would have fallen asleep."
3,Movie - Swing Vote,The movie starts out well and is kinda cute until halfway through where it starts getting bogged down and stays that way. Kinda boring.
2,"One clever idea turned into a long, predictable movie","If you enjoy 2 hours of Kevin Costner acting like a slob and 2 minutes (at the very end) of his heroic customary speeches in which his voice cracks down while defending his less fortunate fellow men, well, this is the movie for you. Personally I found this very similar to ARTHUR in which the prospect of watching the part of a stupid drunk for a long time gets more and more annoying. I also had a hard time buying his wholesome daughter and after watching her Mom and Dad it becomes impossible to understand how she could turn out that wonderful. The movie itself is all one clever idea with very mediocre dialogue, flat jokes and lacking any surprises."
2,90 minutes of yawns followed by an OK speech,"I fell asleep a couple times during this movie because it was so boring. Kevin Costner's acting was less than stellar. The girl was OK but the movie was too boring for me to care. It all felt completely contrived. There was no depth to anything in the movie either, except for the final speech which was the only 2 minutes of the movie worth watching.Really the whole message of that speech is that Americans (yes Kevin represents most of us) are lazy, ignorant, selfish people who deserve the politicians that we put in office with our ignorance and falling for their manipulative advertisements. After I gave it a little thought, I find this highly offensive.Regardless, the movie was boring, bland, predictable, and I wish I had not wasted my time watching it. It's not HORRIBLE it's just not good."
2,Very Disappointed.,I was very disappointed. Once more the trailer is much better than the film. In this case the trailer really sold me on this one and really let me down. It was far from what I expected. Costner really slept walked through his one. Not only was the film predictable but it was flat out boring! Even the fine supporting cast couldn't save this one.
